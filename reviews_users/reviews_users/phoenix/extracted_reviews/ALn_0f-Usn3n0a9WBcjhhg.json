It's a converted department store, make sure to check out the basement, bathrooms and elevator. If you have out of town guest of have never been, make it a priority to check out. If only Phoenix had more places like this.",

    "text": "I feel a strong sense of deja vu since I swear I've reviewed Hanny's before. Alas, I have not.   I've been here several times since last year. I love the design of this department store turned restaurant. And the basement! The creepy dolls are so awesome. Once I got behind the gate and got a picture with the dolls... totally got caught trespassing but oh well. Worth it. The vibe is very hip and trendy, definitely a great place to impress a date.   Onto the food-I don't really eat meat so my options are limited. Every time I actually eat there though, I'm all over the Cauliflower Calabrese. It's on the appetizer menu, but I always order it as my entree. It's a spicy veggie mix of cauliflower, peppers and onion strings. So. Damn. Delicious. I've had the bruschetta, and it totally wasn't what I expected it to be since it's more of a tampenade with bread. I also had a veggie sandwich there once that was pretty tasty, I'd still pick the cauliflower dish over it any day though. I look forward to the day where more veggie or fish options are available, take note Hanny's!  Drink-wise, I usually order the Moscow Mule. Do NOT order it from the upstairs bar, they don't serve it in the copper mugs and trust that it is not the same. I also like ordering Jameson with a splash of ginger ale. The bartenders know what they're doing and make stiff drinks (at least in my experience).   As far as service is concerned, it's alright. I wouldn't say it's the greatest. I'm pretty patient though because when I go, it's normally super packed. I prefer to sit at the bar where the bartenders are more attentive & quicker.   All in all, this is a super cool lounge to hang out with and have dinner with some friends, or just a few drinks. You have my heart Hanny's.",

Drink menus is impressive, prices are typical for downtown. I tried the Moscow Mule and Ginger Creek- both good. We wanted to try the pizza, hearing it was good but their pizza over was down for maintenance the night we went (lame). I had a pork sandwich that was okay - the coleslaw was really good though. Bathrooms are weird, have fun with that. They played good music, that was a plus. Keep a lookout for the manneuin shrine located in the \"basement\" - creepy.",

    "text": "Just went to Hanny's for the first time and really loved it!  It reminded me of one of the speak-easy style restaurant/bars in LA, with a great menu and drink selection to boot.  If I lived in AZ, this would surely be a hang out.  I had a beet salad, veggie pizza, and a Pim's cup, and really enjoyed the food (as did my family, who also had pizzas and dessert).  This place is great if you have stuff to do downtown (either before or after a show/event), and the swanky/sexy atmosphere would be great for a date as well.  I loved that they kept the vibe of the former store alive, but added their own flare, including the bathrooms & downstairs (it is a must to see both).  Our server Nicole did an awesome job!  She was really nice and on top of it, and made the evening even more special.  The bar was packed and for good reason - the bartenders really know how to make a drink!  (They are all pretty easy on the eyes, too...).  A DJ was spinning from his perch above the crowd, adding to the overall cool ambiance.  I recommend parking in a lot nearby as it can be a bit hard to find a spot on a busy night.  But, there's a lot to walk to nearby, so you get a lot of bang for your buck.  A huge plus - the kitchen is open until 1am 7 days a week!  Phoenix needs more places like Hanny's!  A must-try for great food, drinks, & service in a really cool environment!",

Other delightful and unique cocktails abound, so why not try something different.    The food is muy delicioso and we are huge fans of the onion straws, gorgonzola slaw and mushroom sandwich, as well as the flat bread pizzas.  Everything is reasonably priced and will not disappoint.

Such a hip vibe...beautiful people...good food. And the meat! They hand slice the prosciutto to order at the bar! Hubs and I had the bar snack plate. Delish. Although I will say the quality of bread could be improved- it was a bit dry and boring. We usually don't order more than the meat plate. This time we also shared the Margarita pizza. The crust was tortilla-thin and crispy. Perfecto!  Just like we like it!! Their sauce is deliciously tangy and flavorful. Good job, Hannys! We can't wait to see you again!",

Yeah we were probably slightly past the level of drunk to appropriately be at this place when we stumbled upon it, but who cares.   We walked in and it has the most amazing 60s-70s vibe, it's openly laid out (picture if the cosmetics section of macys was a restaurant, since it is a converted department store) and posh.   The old elevator shaft is awesome, and so are the dressing rooms converted into bathrooms (which unfortunately were kind of gross, but it is a lounge/late night spot so I forgive).The dolls in the basement I don't understand but that's okay, it just added to my tipsy fascination with the place at the time.  Anyway we had the prosciutto pizza which was good and prosecco, which was also good, but a tad expensive. Basically go here if you want to get your drink on and simultaneously feel like you are in a James Bond movie.",

I love the sexy vibe!  A  nice big square bar gives the bartenders access to all of their patrons in very workable space. Ideal for conversations and meeting new people.   Although the food and drinks maybe a bit pricey,coming here once in a while dinner before hanging out downtown is definitely worth it!  They hand pick and place fresh flowers on their table tops nightly which provides for that sexy vibe I mentioned earlier.   The DJ is supa sneaka and hidden above the entrance in a booth. Being that this is an older building rebuilt into a bar / dinner spot they have a wicked cool abandoned Elevator shaft with a glass floor that is fun to walk on and experience some of Phoenix history and culture.",

I love the idea of reusing a building instead of tearing it down.  It's especially cool because they kept some of the old aspects of the department store.  The restrooms appear to have been the old fitting rooms.  The menu consists mainly of unique sandwiches.  One of the side options is the slaw, which they put a unique twist on.  It contains feta and raisins.  There is also a DJ that plays great remixes.  Overall, I great place in downtown Phoenix.",

They have DJs come in on weekends. For how nice the place is, it is still pretty affordable.  I've tried a few things on the menu and the carne pizza as well as the gorgonzola slaw are both incredible. I don't usually like all meat pizzas but the carne is the exception! Also, I usually get the Peartini. It's fairly sweet and deceptively strong. After a few of these, I'm ready to start my night!

    "text": "Pretty marvelous place considering that this was an old department store that they have turned into a lounge/bar with the potential to have a club type feel to it .Hanny's does in my opinion suffer from a bit of an identity crisis because it feels like all three and none of the above at the same time. That doesn't bother me thought because I can just sit down at the bar and look around because it really is amazing to see the modern mixed in with some deliberately remaining fixtures of the past. The upper floor has a small bar(that I've never seen in use) a  few more intimate spaces to hang, a VERY confusing bathroom area (due to the mirrors and lighting-you're doomed if there's an emergency) and a balcony that opens to the floor below where the classy bar is smack dab in the middle. There is a dinning area surrounding two sides as well as some tables and high chairs on the other side.  There is a DJ perch opposite the balcony where pretty cool, chill tunes add to the loungey feel of this place. They have a good selection of beer and wine and according to my girl, \"The BEST Manhattan EVER!!!\" (served by Rene who had awesome glasses) What I really like about this place is that it's a great place to get a little dressed up and have some high quality adult beverages. Places like this are rare in Phoenix so if you feel like putting on something nicer than jeans and flip flops to enjoy a classy night out, I would recommend checking out Hanny's.",

I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare but I thought, \"nah, forget it. yo homes.. to bel-air!\" I...pulled...up to the house at about 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cabby \"yo homes, smell ya later!\" I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there -- to settle my throne as the prince of bel-air.",

It is definitely the place to go if you want to enjoy a classy drink in a supper club atmosphere.  I have yet to move past the drink menu, so that is just about all I can criticize. The caipirinha is pretty well balanced, although I could have done without the rock candy swizzle stick (I know that a sugar cane garnish may be tough to come by in Phoenix, so we don't mind if you leave it out). They use Cachaca 51 which isn't my favorite, but it is passable.  The sidecar was strong. Not in a good way. I enjoy sidecars because they incorporate a lot of different sweet flavors, but this just made me feel like a lush drinking a citrus-flavored martini.  Speaking of martinis, the gin martini was decent, although tiny (but a good buy for $5).  The staff is friendly and flirty -- in fact, my friend slipped the waiter my phone number after we noticed him admiring my shoes. Yep, it was that kind of night.",

The ambiance was electric and the service was if we had worked together before.  The music was hot.  And if you haven't seen the art downstairs...I think you should...",

    "text": "I had a hard time even giving this place the third star.  I had high hopes as I watched this place go through renovations during the past 3 years.  We were there on opening night and fell in love with the decor.  The place was stylish and cool.  Concrete, leather, glass...very retro-modern.  The people who refurbished and redesigned this place deserve five stars.  The people who work there, however, deserve one.    On opening night, I forgave the delay in service.  I forgave the nasty arugula on my panino.  I forgave the store-bought peperoni.  Mostly, I forgave them because the onion straws were so good.  We went back a few nights later after being fleeced for $40 in return for table scraps at Sens.  It took almost twenty minutes to order two pizzas and onion straws.  Then, the pizzas came out before the onion straws.  How do you cook pizza faster than deep frying an onion?  The waiter lingered around the female members of our party and were just incompetent.    We finally went again after a night of drinking at the Clarendon.  What a buzz kill.  Not only was it too dark and the music was too loud but, again, the service was slow and dull.  Then, the waitress got into an argument about the ingredients of the pizza with our group.  Big no-no.  I've had multiple people tell me that service is fine as long as you order from the bar.  They say, just get up and go tell the bar tender what you want.  Why should I have to do all of the work?  How is it that they have ASU students at their disposal in a terrible economy and can't hire any decent waiters?  From now on, I'm only going after a game when I want some onions and a Moretti.",

    "text": "This space has GREAT potential... The question is...will it ever achieve it ??    I applaud the \"vision\" of Karl Kopp, I feel he preserved the original architectural elements of the building, while finally catapulting the central Phoenix's bar /restaurant scene into 2008.  Finally an upscale restaurant and bar that actually looks like money went into the renovation... Ikea purchased items were not identified here.     The main \"lobby\" bar/restaurant on the first floor is huge... anchored by a large square bar in the center of the room... the ceiling soars above... a perfect space for an art installation.  The room is basically divided into a 60/40 bar/dining area with the main focus on the bar area.    Speaking of the bar area... strange place... although the seating at the bar is exceptional, several standard bar features are missing... The standard visual liquor selection is nowhere to be found, and the bartender was at a loss for the choices of vodka.  I'm not sure where they bought their martini glasses... they are NOTHING close to the \"birdbath\" martini  size of AZ88...perhaps someone confused the martini glass order and shipped out eye wash cups... I'm thinking that these are not the standard size  and it was all just a very evil joke! (Hint... if you enjoy olives in your martini... order them on the side.  Once  the spear of olives is removed from the drink,  the drink then becomes half empty... exzageration?  fabrication? Order one and decide for yourself)  Speaking of size..check out the enormous medieval torture device in the center of the bar... oh wait... I'm sorry... it's an industrial size prosciutto slicer.. Silly me.  Bevnaps where never used, perhaps they have not been stocked yet??   The restaurant table service was spotty, if not aloof.  This type of attitude works great after the restaurant opens and introduces the red rope / bouncer.. my opinion... first learn how to wait on tables, then concentrate on affecting (or should I say...perfecting) the attitude.    The \"deconstructed\" prosciutto and melon plate we ordered was nothing special, the crisp bread pizza type app was ok.. again, nothing exciting here.  Well, that's not True.. as there IS something exciting in this bar... The bathroom area on the mezzanine level!!.. mirrors and white hot lighting ensures that if you look \"good\" in that lighting... you'll look \"GREAT\" in the soft lighting of the bar area.    The balcony seating area in my opinion would be better used as a low seating area rather than a dining area. One can only hope that the upper floors will be used for live music and outdoor seating.  The basement should be opening soon, potentially a moshpit dance area? Who knows..  If you've been to Swigg in Santa Fe, you'll feel right at home here... Check it out, give it a try... or wait until they \"weed out\" the bad help and get the place up to speed.",

    "text": "I don't know of a single Phoenician who wasn't absolutely ecstatic about Hanny's opening.  We were all excited for this cool new \"destination.\"  The husband and I were the second pair of people to walk through their doors.  There were literally hoards of employees working at the time.  There were about 15 upstairs staring at us, about 5 at the bar, and 15 or so more servers just chillin around the restaurant.  Somehow, with all these people, they managed to completely ignore us for most of our meal.  Making a typical 45 minute to 1 hour dinner experience turn into a 2 hour ordeal.  The decor of this place is beautiful.  Cool, clean, and modern.  The music fluctuates from being too loud and inappropriate for the setting to being perfect with an eclectic but well blended mix.   The pizza is decent, but very appetizer-ish.  It is cracker thin, which turns a lot of people off, but I actually like it.  The onion strings are to die for when they aren't completely grease laden.  That's an off and on thing, not really consistent.  I don't like their sandwiches.  They are unimaginative and bland.  There really isn't a lot to choose from on the menu.  Unfortunately both times we brought friends along with us, the place was a buzz kill, and I am not really sure why.  Maybe we will try the place again now that it has been open for a while.  Hopefully Hanny's has figured out what he wants to be when he grows up.",

    "text": "A place that still honors fashion; even after its destruction and reconstruction of the building that once housed a top of the line Department store. If only i could give it a higher rating, based solely on that, but alas this review is about the food. We arrived about 10pm on a friday, so i was thrilled that the full menu was still available; as the entire downtown PHX had almost closed down completely. We sat at the sleek bar, only to be served by a gentleman wearing a filthy butchers apron, it was so unappealing, but i thought if others stayed regardless, then the food must be off the hook!  The music definitely moved me, and i think its what was keeping the people there, lucky for the kitchen.  Wrong, It was anything but. The pizza margarita tasted as though it were made with cheddar, exactly like a mexican cheese crisp. Not good at all! Turns out they make it with a mixture of 3 italian cheeses mozzarella, provolone and asiago. In my opinion provolone should always be served with a meat or mushrooms, because its bold flavor is too over powering to be served with light flavors.   The pork sandwich was soo dry, it was served on hard bread too. I had one bite and left it for brian. I won't be trying that one again.   The best part of my meal was only $4+ and it was the side salad=super big. They added hearts of palms too! I couldn't believe the serving size. Too bad their balsamic dressing is straight balsamic, It would have been okay had they brought out olive oil too. They served me a gobblet of straight balsamic dressing for the salad.   I think they are trying very hard to be cool, but they exert little effort. They do half the job great, then they slack off, so its kinda like being in Willy Wonka's half room. You fall in love with one part, then quickly realize it lacks big time.  The decor is nice, but not enough to make up for the weird uniforms of dirty white butcher shirts or the proscuitto sitting out in the open air; with flys dancing around, sitting on your meat and having a feast until they slice off your piece. Not my cup 'o tea thank you very much.   Maybe my next try will be better, because I will give it another 2 times, as it takes 3 times to know what they trully have to offer.",

Went there last nite with a bunch of fabulous Phoenix yelpers on the light rail pub crawl, and it was in a word, okay.  I know there were a lot of us, but even so, it took a REALLY long time to get drinks.  TOO long...  Anyways, once we finally got our drinks, they were delicious!!  My mojito was excellent, one of the best I've had in Arizona.  Just the right amount of sugar and mint, not too sweet.  My mouth is starting to water just thinking about it!   Of course I only had one because it was $10, a little too steep in my opinion.  No happy hour or drink specials at all either which is kind of a bummer...  Didn't eat anything there but saw other people's food and it looked tasty.  Great location, about a block and a half up the street from the US Airways Center.  I'll definitely give Hanny's another shot and go there for dinner  before or after a Suns game, with a smaller group, and a stacked wallet  of course : )",

The place was empty on a Sunday night witch it made the space looks even bigger.  We went with a group of nine and ordered a little of everything, asked a few question to the server which didn't know much about the menu, he had to go back to the kitchen for every question, just basic question.  When the food arrived and after a few bites me and all the others arrived to the conclusion that Hanny's might be better for drinks, the pizza , if you can call it pizza, is more like a flat bread with very little flavor and with cheap topping, the salads were really small and again with cheap ingredients.  Overall is an ok place to have a drink with friends after a dinner some place else.",

Prosciutto, crusty bread and ripe melon. Does life get any better? Pair that with a couple of glasses of wine and wonderful company...what a great Thursday night!   I didn't get to explore too much but I have heard that the bathrooms are amazing and you should check out the elevator shaft!

    "text": "My first visit to Hanny's was on New Years Eve and I have to start off saying that I did not try there food so my review is solely based off of visiting this establishment as a bar.   The interior of Hanny's is amazing. The modern elements and atmosphere is different than any other place I have visited in Phoenix. The bar is large and central and there are plenty of places to sit, lounge, hide, or socialize. The restrooms are upstairs, which could be troublesome as the night progresses, but thankfully they do have an elevator for those of use who are not steady on heels after a few drinks. The service at the bar was slow, but it was busy and having good company helped me forget that I was without drink. The long islands are strong, very strong, 2 day hang over strong- but they did the trick.   Hanny's is the type of place I would take out of town friends to show them that Phoenix is a city on the rise and not just a Hard Rock Cafe and Hooters type of town. I think that with time some of the other reviewers issues will work out and I hope that with the light rail business will continue to flourish for them. Hanny's has potential and I am curious to return and try food.",

I had the calabrese sandwich and tbh just tasted like kung pao pork on a ciabatta bread it was missing a lot of flavor just very bland, idk if that's what they are going for but if your a real cook you know that there's something missing.

Even though the layout is a bit kludgy, it's forgiven because it retains authenticity as a former clothing store. The menu is a bit different also and for that I am grateful. My go-to is the chopped salad. It's vegetarian (has eggs and cheese) and a lot of flavor going on. They have a couple of nice platters if you are just sitting at the bar looking to nosh. They are all in on cocktails and have a few things that you won't find other places AND if you like a regular martini, they're $5. Hanny's kitchen stays open late and I've been surprised at how packed they can be late at night. Good value downtown.",

    "text": "$5 maritnis, all day, all the time. Need i say more?  Well I can. The food is good, the service is quick, the quirky doctors outfits on the servers and bartenders, and weirdo decor make this a really interesting place to hang out and enjoy a dirty martini. On weekends, a small window opens up in this commercial-shopping-center-turned-bar and DJ will start spinning beats. The bathrooms here are confusing and super trippy like a fun house with mirror, and if you go downstairs, you'll see a bunch of creepy caged up dolls. If eccentric, unique and $5 maritinis are your things- i recommend checking this weird gem out.",

    "text": "Hey Rico Suave, hopefully you're already taking all your dates here because it never ceases to impress.  In all seriousness I've been back to Hannys a few times since my last review and I'm still feelin it... Stopped in post symphony for drinks and a bite.  A bit loud for much convo with the electronic music being \"dj\"ed from the booth on Apple laptops.  We managed to snuggle in a booth and enjoy the scene.  The champagne cocktails still please this princess with the French 75 to my liking these days.  They wine selection is solid and I recommend the zin for a lighter red that works well with food or on its own.  The bar sliced prosciutto is a must try either on the bar plate or the pizza. Salty goodness with super thin crust highlights the Parmesan and arugula nicely complimenting the prosciutto.  The quirky charm of the glass floored elevator shaft, downstairs dungeon scene, or upstairs bar area give this spot enough interest to linger.  (Plus you can get a nice look at your date's assets showing her around the venue.)",

I've been here with groups ranging from one other person to a dozen and the service has always been great. It's not a dive bar by any means so if that's your expectation you won't like it. Nor do they have TVs, this is the kind of place you go when you actually want to talk to your group. The cocktail menu has a lot of classics and they do them justice. Plus, you can't beat $2.50 midnight martinis.",

You might just end up reading it, calling in sick, *cough*, *cough*, catching a ride (cab, light rail, uber, lyft, friend, bicycle, skateboard, roller skates, shoes, or slippers) and spending your day at Hanny's instead.  Hanny's has a special place in my heart. Oh, Hanny's. You're close enough to my house to be an easy light rail destination, and just far enough for me to stay away most of the time. \"Dangerous curves ahead\" doesn't even begin to cover the tepidness one should take while ordering your $5 martini's, especially when you order them on the rocks, in a tumbler glass, and a couple of limes to dress it up instead. Your $5 martini special is always special and that's just why I like you, you make every hour happy and not just the hours between 3pm and 6pm ;-)  The one complaint I hear from most people and many reviews is that at Hanny's, there's no Happy Hour, I think you just have to know to order their $5 martinis. I generally consider happy hours to be happy only when they come coupled with a decent drink selection AND food selection, but those martini's, they make up for it.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, set your limit at two, possibly even one, be sure you've got a DD and have the happiest of hours.",

    "text": "Hanny's is one of those places that I had driven by several times while in Phoenix, and I finally got a chance to check it out while downtown and hungry after getting out of a concert around 11:30ish - the first question that popped into my head was who is still serving food @ this hour?  Yelped Hanny's and sure enough their kitchen stays open until 1 AM I believe ;)  It was quite busy here after the concert ... I'm sure many people came here after the show as well since it was a Wednesday night and not much  seemed to be going on downtown around the arena.  It's a cool modern upscale looking space ... We were seated promptly upon arrival.  However, the service the rest of the night was subpar overall.  It took out server probably 10-15 minutes to greet us, and by that time we were ready to place our full order of food and a few cocktails.    We tried the shrimp prosciutto first - it says on the menu that it was grilled, but it tasted and looked like the shrimp were fried.  Neither of us cared for this item - it was VERRRY salty and tasted rather blah.   We also tried the Carne Pizza - it was much better than the shrimp, but nothing to boast about.   To be honest ... I was not really a fan of the food menu here.  I am fairly easy going when it comes to food, but nothing really caught my attention on this \"odd\" menu.  We also tried a dirty martini and a coconut rum and pineapple, and the drinks were good.  Nevertheless, our server forgot to bring lemons with our waters as we requested.  She also failed to give me 3 blue cheese olives as requested ... Instead I only received two olives :(  The atmosphere was cool trendy as a DJ spun music from a booth in the venu - but the music was so loud it was hard to talk without having to constantly say WHAT? Huh? I CAN'T HEAR YOU ..,  I had much higher hopes for Hanny's - it looks the part - loved the ambiance (would have been better if the music wasn't so loud).  I do feel they should revamp their entire menu because it consists of far too many unappealing items.  Train your servers better - I know there was probably a big rush after the concert, but the manager should be aware of a concert going on and should have had sufficient staff ready to go.  At this point I would rate Hanny's a mere 2 stars because it was just an overall mediocre experience.  There isn't anything memorable about food/drinks there, the service was poor, the prices seemed a bit high based on the poor service & lack of great taste. and I would probably only return for drinks, since they did appear to have quite a unique drink menu.  I would try coming back here again if I was in the area, but I def won't be going out of my way to make a return visit.",

The restaurant itself is housed in an old International style building (built in the 40's) that used to be a department store. I love ambiance of the bar area and it even has a meat slicer present to slice up some thin slices of prosciutto. Some of my favorites are the Porchetta, Giardiniera & Rossa Bianco pizzas. Check out Sunday nights for $10 pizza nights and drink specials. Make sure you check out the basement area and get a look at the creepy dolls on display.",

The cauliflower dish wasn't my favorite just because it tasted like it should be on a pizza, nothing exciting but I everything else was great.  I think my favorite part was the service.

After at least 5 minutes, someone came to the hostess stand, and said that it would be about 25-30 minutes for a table. As he is telling us the wait time, we can see that there are at least 4 open tables to the left of us. My guess is that they were closing within the hour, and didn't want to seat us. So, they gave us a crazy wait time, so that we would leave. Rude. We were there for another 3 days, and did not return for a second chance.",

It was very tart so be weary if you're more of a smokey person.   The environment was great being really packed on a Friday night. Our group experienced a mediocre waitress -- often leaving us thirsty throughout the night. But given that it was busy we were forgiving. We also had their margarita pizza which was on point. This is one of the best thin slices I've ever had!",

    "text": "Sometimes, you've had a hard week, lots of issues, or a big quality review, and by Friday you are the mental equivalent of a limp dish rag and you just need...you just need, in the words of some unknown hipster, to chillax and commiserate on the travails of modern work life with your peers and that is where Hanny's comes in as an ideal lunch spot.  My office building is close to downtown Tempe so Hanny's is a bit out of the way and if you drive, instead of take the light rail, the parking and driving in downtown Phoenix is an adventure unto itself but if you get there before noon and walk in you are greeted by a world of dark leather tones, gently playing classical music and a lack of artificial lighting (so prevalent in our modern workplace), and waitstaff that know how to be efficient and helpful and not overly intrusive (I distinctly remember that the waiter did not feel the need to come over every five minutes and ask how things were going, but instead quietly came around and refilled drinks, which I greatly appreciated).  I had the roast beef sandwich which was a layering of one or two thin slices of ribeye, delicious salty/smokey bacon and a fried egg on Ciabatta bread which was wonderfully soft and hugged the sandwich like a loving mother hugs a beloved child, creating the most delicious amalgamation of flavors as I noshed through my sandwich with little driblets of egg yolk falling like summer rain onto my plate (which is how I saw it but my dining companions might have just have thought of that as messy eating).  The BLT was quite popular among my dining companions though I was somewhat disappointed no one went for the BLT supremo which has the addition of a sliced hard boiled egg and provolone cheese (egg of any time on a lunch sandwich seems to be a bit out of most people's culinary interests except for a hard few, like your fearless yelper). Other's had the rocket salad (which seemed to involve a large amount of arugula, though my friend seemed to enjoy it, and another had the chopped salad). I myself had a small side salad and the lemon vinaigrette was wonderfully subtle and fresh and I distinctly remembered commenting on how much I enjoyed it.  So there I was, exhausted after a tough week of office political infighting, and as I ate my delicious sandwich, laughed and joked with my peers, had my ice tea regularly and quietly filled up, all while hearing the ebullient  strains of classical music underscoring my experience, I felt the despair drain out of me and my willingness to go back next week into the office fray blossom once again.   Okay, so four stars...obviously I loved it so why not five? Well, I don't feel that I've truly experienced a place like this one until I've had the happy hour/dinner experience and I have a feeling that this is when a place like this really shines, when the sun has not only been down but down for a loooooooong time, especially since they serve food till 1 am and last pour is at 1:30...so you have time to finish the drink and still make the last light rail.  In fact, having dinner with some other friends tonight and will put that on our future itinerary. Until then, happy eating my fellow yelpers. :-)",

But . . . you can have all these elements and still make your costumer pause and think . . . Hmmm, there are so many restaurants in Phoenix . . . I want my regular place to be a happy place.

    "text": "Kind of bummed now.   I have been to Hanny's many times and always had a pleasant experience. I have always enjoyed what I have ordered almost always seem to order the same things. This time, however, not so much. Actually, based on this visit, I am not sure we will drive across town just to have dinner here.   I have always enjoyed the look of Hanny's, I think it's really well done and I enjoy the vibe and energy. I don't think the service has ever stood out to me, and this time - yeah, definitely not. We had to wait awhile for a host to seat us, a busser bumped into me carrying a tub of glassware and didn't even pardon himself, and our server was alright but the service was rather basic and impersonal.  Drinks - I always order an Old Fashioned here (my favorite cocktail) and I remembered they were good. I don't know if they changed them or the bartender rushed and didn't taste his creation - but that was awful. I am not one to typically send a drink back unless it is completely disgusting - it wasn't, just not that enjoyable. It tasted like bitter whiskey soda. Too much bitters, not enough syrup, and I would recommend they use Amarena cherries like most other bars are doing now, not cheap Maraschinos that they muddled in my glass with the stems on. Cmon! My boyfriend ordered the Huckleberry Lemonade - what a sugar rush! I don't know how people can drink that, but hey, to each their own. It tasted like something a 21-year old would order at Applebee's. I would think Hanny's would update to keep up with the trendy places around town, get some craft-cocktails, etc.   Food - I always order the Asparagus & Egg - ehh - the asparagus was overcooked and yellowish. Disappointed. This is something I recommended we order for my boyfriend to try for the first time as it was my favorite starter. I also typically order the Carne pizza and the Prosciutto pizza. One thing I will say, their crust is just to my liking - mwah! I love a good thin and crispy crust. The Carne is a bit greasy - cheese, ground beef, pepperoni - but the crust saves it being crisp and a little dry to soak up the extra wetness. The Prosciutto was ok except for the arugula - it was not fresh, a bit dry and rubbery like it had sit out for awhile.   All in all, I still like Hanny's. I think the place is cool, the atmosphere is fun, the prices are good, the food is good. It is...good. Not great. I don't know if I will still refer to it as one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix anymore, but if I am ever downtown and want Pizza and a drink, I may stop in again.",

Who doesn't like roast beef that is griiiilllled? complemented with fried egg and bacon.  It didn't help that the ciabatta was just as tough to chew.  Boy, was it a loooong lunch.  One bite after another, thinking about all the starving children of the world.  I'm doing it for you guys, you hear me?! You guys!!!  Alas, I finished every single bite.  A few things that could improve this sandwich: use butter, perhaps make the meat a little rare, and use softer bread!  The only thing that saved this whole lunch was their homemade doughnuts.  It was soft and airy complemented with their fresh strawberry sauce and chocolate.  Another fail was trying to find their restroom, which I never found! I was told to head up the stairs and through mirrored hallway?! As contemporary as this place was, this creepy area I went to just did not fit the picture.  I eventually came across this narrow hallway with mirrors all around and then all of sudden it got bright with a bunch of doors.    I seriously felt like I was at a carnival and I was suppose to choose, Door #1, Door #2, or Door #3.  Where the freak did I end up? Did I just enter the Twighlight Zone?

    "text": "Hanny's is a cool spot downtown. It's right across from US Airways center, making it a great place to go either before or after you catch a game/show (aka get your drinks cheaper!) They are know for their $5 martini. Yeah, it's $5 and it DOESN'T SUCK!! I got it clean, because some places, getting it dirty is just disgusting. It was ice cold, went down smooth, and did the job well.   I've also tried a few of their champagne cocktails, because I am a classy broad. The French 75 is very delicious and for a few $$ more, the Celebration is tre chic. Their Old Fashioned is pretty damn good too and strong. I think I will slowly work my way through their other cocktails, starting with their Moscow Mule (yes, they come with the copper cup).  Food wise, I usually go with a small snack platter to balance out my cocktail intake. It's good for 2 people max and comes with a variety of salty meats, cheeses, olives, and nuts. I've also had the milanesa which was really good and big enough to share! Some day when I am feeling extra fancy (aka make a date take me here), I'll try some real entrees.   Dress code wise, it's all over the map. You'll see people dressed up like they've come from the opera, others like they rolled out bed, and some like they are waiting for their pimp. It's a scene, that's for sure. As for ambiance, the restrooms are trippy. There's no guys/girls, it's a big cluster *bleep* and you kind of feel like you're in a fun house. Also, check out the old elevator shaft. And also, ask to go downstairs. But don't blame me if you're scarred for life.   For now, Hanny's is my \"Hey, let's be semi-classy, get real-people drinks, and act like adults, but for cheaper!\" place.",

The atmosphere is very modern  with low lighting, soft house music, European style bathrooms, and abstract art pieces on the main floor and basement. I had a pulled pork sandwich (which was absolutely delicious) and a Kilt Lifter, even though they only serve it in bottles (if you're looking for a place with a nice selection of beer on tap, this is not your place). My only real comlaint would be the music selection. They have a DJ booth that looks down on the dining floor with a DJ who plays music that doesn't really seem to require an actual DJ. Basically soft house music with the same beat playing over and over for the entire duration of out visit. If you're into modern cocktails, great food, and trippy art this is the place for you :)",

I like to think about it as a local version of the chain restaurant Joeys (but without being pretentious).   My husband and I ordered the cauliflower and a pizza (half bianco, half prosciutto). The food was so tasty! It tasted very fresh and full of flavor. We even had to order desert. Our server let us know that they make everything in house except for the Chocolate Crisp Cake. We had the Tiramisu, which was to die for.   Tip: The pizza is VERY thin.. more like flat bread, but it was still amazing. Our server said that one person can eat a whole pizza if it doesn't have meat on it. So plan accordingly.   The ambiance of the place is very cool. Our server let us know that the restaurant used to be a department store, and then after it was abandoned it was used by the local fire department as a test building. It was pretty cool to walk around the restaurant and see the history. Make sure you check out the bathrooms on the second floor and the basement for a surprise art exhibit! (Our server wouldn't tell us what it was.. so just check it out for yourselves like we did. :p )   One thing that Hanny's is lacking is draft beer as well as soda on tap. I haven't been to many restaurants that don't have this, and as a fan of draft beer, I was a little disappointed. I understand that Hanny's bar focus is their cocktails though. Also they do not have a happy hour (but they do have their $5 martinis which they seem to be famous for).",

And, since we heard they did the late-night food thing @ Hanny's, it sounded perfect.  Dude...Whoa...That's pretty much what happened when my friend and I went up the stairs through the fun-house mirrored corridor to find the bathrooms. I felt like I was in a messed-up dream and one of the doors was hiding the gates of hell. It was bizarre, vertiginous, and I wasn't sure that I'd be able to go back through that hallway to get to the main dining level. Whooo! But I had to pee later, and everything was ok on the second trip. But it sure as hell needed getting used to.  But still, an amazing space, very \"Logan's Run\" in the crisp, almost sterile, blue/green hues that pervaded throughout.  I didn't feel like I was in Phoenix at all. Too big, too groovy, too put-together. I could envision the place packed to the gills like a NYC joint.   No pretentiousness that I experienced, which, from the looks of the place, I was a little wary at first. We got down with some Peroni's, which I enjoyed, as not many places carry that beer. Ordered a couple flatbread pizzas which were super-tasty, and some potato strings that were just kinda fun to eat. Pretty much just had a good, easy-going time, drinking and eating with chill tunes saturating the environment. Our server, aside from possessing spectacularly classic beauty, was really cool and down-to-earth, attentive, helpful...just awesome.    As a sweaty pedestrian post-concert goer, I had a great experience, and was glad to be treated so warmly late on a Sunday night. I will definitely go back whenever I'm downtown. Yay!",

So far, I've tried the English Garden, which supplants any other mixed drink I've had as the best summer beverage.  It's 13 dollars, and contains the perfect proportions of Hendrick's Gin, St. Germain liqueur, and muddled cucumber.  Quite refreshing, strong, and yet incredibly quaffable.  Check it out.",

I liked the raw decor, the dj spinning, and the overall concept, but the service was HORRIBLE!    We waited at least 20 min for our drinks, it seemed as though our waitress was avoiding eye contact with us at all costs.  We waited another 20 min to order, and would have waited even longer if we hadn't of called over one of the other 5 employees that were standing around shooting the shit with each other.  When we finally got our food, it was ok at best.  I could have excused the mediocrity of the food, but the service has turned me off from ever going back here.",

Our waitress did tell us that it was extra for the gluten free pizza (but not the martinis) but she seemed peeved when we asked her what else was gluten free and what was vegatarian.She said \"anything on the menu wthout bread or meat\".The pizzas were like tortilla chips with really thin really crunchy crust.Two of our pizzas were burnt on the edge.Yes, this place was busy but we should not of had to wait as long as we did for burnt food.They do not have ranch for the pizzas either which was disapointing for our group.The waitress never told us her name and she never bothered to pour fresh ice when she came back to refill our waters either.But she gets one extra star for telling my friend who was vegan that the cauliflower plate with onion fries has beef broth in it.Also tell your workers that smiling wont kill them.Our waitress and the girl who brought our food and the guy who brought one of our drinks was more concerned with looking around the restraunt every time instead of smiling at the customers.",

Unfortunately, while it has a \"cool\" factor similar to AZ88 (yet distinct), it doesn't yet have the buzz of a big crowd. On the night we were there (Wednesday before Thanksgiving), it was probably 30% full. Our table of 10 was a large part of the crowd. Here's hoping that things pick up and word of mouth spreads!   The service was GREAT and while the menu is totally different than AZ88 (as it should be), it keeps to the concept of very well prepared, simple foods. Hanny's menu focuses on pizzas, sandwiches and salads. Almost everyone in our party went with pizza and the sausage pizza I chose (as well as the prosciutto pizza I sampled) were both great.   Hanny's is a great addition to the offerings in downtown. I just hope the area can support it!",

    "text": "Great atmosphere and location.  We have been excited to try Hanny's because of it's association with one of our very favorite places, AZ88.  Unfortunately, the menu at Hanny's was a big disappointment.  We opted for the pizza and the roast beef/fried egg sandwich because our server told us they were two of the most popular items on the menu.  The sandwich had zero appeal except for the bread... the roast beef was thickly cut, fatty and oily with no flavor, the fried egg was also oily and dominated the sandwich and with the bacon and arugula... just all very strange and not appealing on any level.  The margarita pizza was ok.  We were starving, so it tasted fine but I'd never come back to get it again.  The Gorgonzola slaw was very good, but I'd trade the pile of shoestring onion rings for AZ88 waffle fries any day.  The martinis were good, but like other items on the menu, expensive for their size and not very appealing.  Loved the vibe, loved the service, loved the music.... would love to come back if we could find a good main dish item to come back for.",

To see the owners working to fix it up rather than tear it down and build some new modern structure was very exciting, but it sure took a long time to open.  Finally it was open and we dashed there right away.     Great design and I loved the place.   The only issue, and it is a big one for me because it is the reason for going there, is that the drinks are small & the prices are high.   Hopefully there will be changes in the future cause I really like the place and find it a nice, trendy downtown location!

We ordered 2 he delivered 3 and when we politely told him this he freaked out. First he said he doesn't make money off of pizza he makes it off of drinks. #1 I don't actually care about how you make your money. #2 the customer is always right...ALWAYS He then proceeded to the host table and twisted the story.. We watched him complain... About us!  Jesse had a real lack for tact. When he brought us our check he then told us he couldn't split the bill because there were cops outside...OK? Jesse this is 2014 and a ridiculous excuse.. You can split a check.. Why? Because that's your job.. You're the server.. I repeat you are the server.. Do I need to say it again ? Do your job and treat people with respect. Mistakes happen.. Also- you do not deserve the gratuity you added on for yourself... Because you know you would have gotten $1. Actually we still would have tipped you because we are a proper group of women. If you were concerned about the cops outside why didn't you card us? Thank you for thinking us to be so young however we celebrated a 30th and 45th birthday. You need a class on respect and your management needs to have a word with you.",

The place is totally cool and had plenty of room for our group (20 people) to hang out and drink without disturbing the diners.   We all got a huge kick out of the renovated elevator shaft and the cool unisex bathrooms. I won't go into detail because most of the other reviews pretty much have it covered. Make sure to check out the DJ located in a little space up above everyone else. The bar is the middle of the place was perfect for the open feel of Hanny's. there was lots of space and various seating options. We settled on the large couches in the front window. There is also space upstairs for eating and drinking if you prefer a more private experience. The service was lacking so I suggest you go to the bar over using a server for cocktails (a friend waited 30 minutes for an Appletini with no apologies when it finally arrived.)   The crowd was a mixed bag of people but everyone was pretty nice. This place is cool and hip without being pretentious. We will be going back next time we are in the area!  We did not eat anything but from what I saw, it looked good. Mainly, pizza and sandwiches.",

    "text": "I came to Hanny's on a recommendation from a friend after looking for a sexy and not too much of a bank breaker place to go with a group of friends for my birthday. I have to admit I was skeptical because of the mixed reviews I saw, but I definitely walked away fairly impressed.   When the first few of us to arrive walked in, we asked for a table for 10 and then proceeded to head up to the restrooms. This was the best decision we could have made for the following reasons: a) We discovered the mirrored hallway and pink walls.  b) We also discovered the sexiest bathrooms alive. 3) I would've never known about the swanky reclining booth seating upstairs that was set away from everything else.   Upon heading downstairs I inquired about the upstairs. I was told it was usually saved for when the downstairs was full, but upon stating it was my birthday party, we were kindly allowed upstairs. We ended up having enough people for 2-3 booths so this was great.  The waiter started out great at first. Refilling water and being patient on the rest of our crowd to arrive. When we all got the point where it was time to order, things started getting confusing and the service started becoming very slow. I received the wrong pizza. I was able to finally get the right one after a little discussion and time, but by the time that happened I had been munching on other things and it was also close to when we were leaving so I had to box it all. Good part? It still tasted delicious for dinner tonight. When the time to get our checks came it got insanely confusing and several people had the wrong items on their checks and had to get a new check printed several times.   The food menu is limited and the service is slow, so I'm not sure I'd return here for dinner again, but I won't say I will never go back. Their drink menu is AMAZING. I was so excited to see such a great list of champagne cocktails and other items. The place is also insanely sexy. I love the lighting, the music, the seating, and the history of the building. I however do not like walking into where the elevator used to be. Hot pink daisy on our table? Also a win!",

We waited... and waited.... they finally came and wow... they were in miniature glasses.  Not so happy about the size.  When you order a martini... it should be in a standard martini glass.  They were tasty though, so we ordered a sandwich and a margarita pizza.  Meanwhile, a table of 4 sat down about 5 minutes after us.  Later when the server finally came with their wine bottle and 4 glasses they had already left.  The table next to us told the waitress \"I guess they got tired of waiting\".

He kept raving about how nice the decor was inside, and I thought, \"Great, another potentially pretentious upscale bar.\" I will say it can give off that vibe but I thought the bar was really nice. It is on the corner of Adams and 1st St, I think, so if you are sitting at the tables by the windows, there is plenty of people watching to be seen. We sat at the bar and it was busy when we got there around 10:30pm. It quickly died out, though. The music was really good with alot of 80's R&B/pop but with beats mixed to it. I had a Malibu and cranberry, hubby had 2 Vodka tonics (Smirnoff), and we split one of their snack plates since we already had dinner. In the middle of the bar is one of those deli slicers with prosciutto and a block of parmesan next to it. The snack plate consisted of some bread, salami, prosciutto, two kinds of olives, roasted pistachios, and slices of parmesan. My kind of snack!! To my shock, our bill was only $24 (with tax). My drink was $7, the vodka tonics were $5 each and the snack plate was $5. I was very surprised at how reasonable those prices were. I suppose given the decor, I was expecting to be charged more so it was a good surprise. Especially for that snack plate where I have paid close to $10 for something similar. I can't wait to return!",

It felt like I was in a creepy episode of black mirror or twilight zone. The bathroom area looks like a creepy mirror fun zone at the circus, the atmosphere throughout looks like a creepy futuristic lounge. There's literally a creepy doll room downstairs and very interesting art throughout the main floor. When I went up to the bathroom there was a girl on who knows what tripping out in all the mirrors she looked like she was lost in narnia.   The service was odd. They all seemed like robots almost. I mean our service was nice but off. And the other ones who came to bring our food were just silent with no expression in their face. Don't want to make allegations but make note of all the other reviews that stated the servers seemed under the influence of you will.   They messed up our order probably because it was so loud they couldn't hear us and when the girl brought our food and said what it was we said no that's not what we ordered and she just said \"oh\" and looked at us confused. I honestly felt uncomfortable the whole time and couldn't wait to get out. Weird, weird vibes. Some that I don't even want to explain!   However the food was good so I'll give them that. We got the margarita pizza add sausage and the hot honey drizzle and the prosciutto wrapped asparagus. Both good.   Will I ever go back? Absolutely not and I might even have nightmares about it to be honest.   We had a large party and we were all ass equally uncomfortable. If you want to experience something you've probably never experienced in a restaurant before and some interesting people watching, check it out.",

From Rene taking care of us the moment we walked in the door, to Russell continuing to deliver outstanding customer service until the end of our meal, these two gentleman showed us what truly was attention to detail delivered in the form of excellent service. We will definitely be back to enjoy quality food and excellent service again.",

The host told us they were just about closed and that we could come back tomorrow because half of the staff didn't show up! I'm sorry but I've never been disappointed here so I guess that's why this is so upsetting to me as a customer. I love hanny's but tonight they were slacking ,",

Lately, though, I've been bringing my nieces and nephew here, and boy do they love it...they're older, 10, 11 & 12, but they can't get enough of the 4 cheese pizza, the Italian sodas and the desserts. I secretly think they like it because of the crazy bathrooms!  Although I wouldn't necessarily call this a \"kid friendly\" venue, the servers are always so nice and welcoming, and as long as your kids are mature and well-behaved, they'll do great!  Whether it's late night or early dinner, Hanny's has a little something for everyone! (Don't forget to tour the basement!!)",

    "text": "Stopped by Hanny's because it was one of the few restaurants open late night in the Downtown Phoenix area after the recent Cheez-It bowl. I was excited to see the vegetarian options so this was our spot. I ordered the portobello sandwich, the hubby got some asparagus and onion strings and I order 2 margherita pizzas for the kids to share. After spending $50, most of the food went to the trash.   The onion strings are solid...A+. Everything else was meh. The kids didn't even eat the pizza. I have the admit that the flavor of it was quite weird. Can't put my finger on it, but it was a very nice sized pizza. The sandwich was less than meh, I ate more of the pizza (which I didn't enjoy) than my sandwich... but I ate all of the onion strings ;-).  The sandwich lacked flavor. No seasoning, no burst of brightness, no acidity, no sauce. It tasted like sauteed mushrooms and bread. And my bread was mush because of the abundance of mushroom juice.   Hey chef! Are you tasting the food that leaves your kitchen?!",

This place is always packing every time I attend.  The place can get loud especially if the DJ is mixing things up in here.  I usually sit at the bar since seating can be tough to get around here.  I order my whiskey and shared a snack plate with my buddy; cured meats, olives, pistachio nuts, and ciabatta bread.  So far a decent start, but nothing too crazy to rave about.  For our entree we shot for the Carne pizza, Italian sausage, pepperoni, cheese blend, and tomato sauce.  I have to say it might not sound too exciting, but rather enjoyed this pizza.  I would really taste the tomato sauce on such a thin crust which I appreciate.  Sometimes I order a thin crust pizza and everything else along with it is thin including the ingredients, but not here!    In the end, Hanny's a go to spot which I generally come downtown.  It's a great atmosphere for drinks and kicks.  I'm can't say the food here is phenomenal, but it'll do the job! - Enjoy!",

So she wasn't very warm to begin with which is fine but literally took about 40 minutes to come back to us to grab our order. When she brought the check to us she LITERALLY told us, \"I'm not splitting the check. Here's a pencil you do the math\". We GLADLY gave her a horrible tip and left. Never ever again will we come in. The food was ok but insanely overpriced. We won't come in here even if you paid us.",

He said he had to go get two more waiters in order for us to put in orders. The waitress came we put in our orders everybody else got their orders before us. We never got silverware.

Our other servers got us water.We flagged him down for more water and silverware and he never came back one of our friends  ordered a salad she got her salad five minutes before we left. She had to hurry up and eat her salad so that we can all be together. The food was good but the service was terrible specially from our waiter he has long curly hair we never got his name because he never told us.

The Cauliflower was pretty good and flavorful...I like the texture of it.  The rest of it was *meh*.  The Pepperoni Pizza was pretty good.  It's very thin and while the portion looks large, it's not too bad if 1 person had it as their entree.  We split it up.  One of my clients had the Panino.  She said it was very good.  We all tried the Strawberry Longcake...which is divine!  It's a Strawberry Cake fused with Ice Cream and Strawberries and topped with Strawberry Drizzle, fresh Strawberries, and Whipped Cream.  Wow, this surprised us and blew us away.  What a nice surprise!  Overall, it's a pretty cool joint.  I hear they have DJ's on the weekend and it turns into a pretty cool spot.  We'll have to come back and try that sometime.  Return Factor - 90%",

Their service is notoriously awful. At about 8PM last night (I was one of maybe, ten people in the whole place) I was met with the status-quo, smug, aloof, demeanor of one entitled, crabby bartender. My salad order was incorrect, then I had to flag him down to place my pizza order, interrupting his annoyingly long conversation with a buddy, less than five feet from where I was sitting.   3. After acknowledging the incorrect order, and being pulled away from his hipster gabfest with the inconvenience of taking my order, I received zero concession on the cost of my botched salad. I did, however, get the privilege of being up-charged  $2.00 for extra sauce on my pizza! Yay!  4. Today I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager, Alex, to obtain his email address. Though he's been GM there for some time, he must have a bit of a memory problem because he gave me the wrong address. Poor guy. Luckily for both of us, I'm rather resourceful and figured out the right one. I sent him a message detailing both my experience last night, as well as previous unpleasant experiences. I've also learned that the he is (or was) the significant other of the owner's daughter, apparently not a recipe for over-achievement (see number 5)  5. Here is the email reply I received from Alex.   \"Liz thank you for the email. First let me say I am sorry for the lack of service you experienced on Sunday. While the goal is to provide excellent service all of the time to everyone, it is not always achievable. Cody did mention your complaint and was truly sorry he said to me that he was unaware of any problem until you mentioned your experience just before you left. We would love the opportunity to serve you again and hopefully make up for your visit this past Sunday. Please give us the chance and please introduce yourself next time you stop by.  Sincerely Alex.\"  Too bad there isn't an abundance of really amazing restaurants in the Phoenix area from which to choose in the future. Oh, wait...",

We bought tickets to the ballet, and decided on one of our favorite places before hand, Hanny's.  We sat at the bar to find two disheveled bartenders and one young man in training.  After waiting several minutes to receive menus and an offer for a drink, we decided on our cocktails. When the bartender heard which type of liquor I requested, she said I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between that and their well, trying to down-sell me. This has never happened to me before. You'd think I would be happy to spend less money, however I do not appreciate the bartender arguing with me about my preferences.   Though I ordered it up, my cocktail came on the rocks. I asked for a glass that I could pour it into and she seemed inconvenienced to correct her own mistake.  Then, we overheard another bartender training the young man. She said, \"you are supposed to just do a rinse of absinthe however, I just put a little bit in the shaker instead. It's easier.\" WTF? Now I'm hearing training staff telling the new guy to take short cuts?!   The food arrived, meh. The snack board could use EVOO but I felt like asking for it would have seemed high maintenance to our less than enthusiastic staff.   The salads were nearly naked and required extra dressing. (We are usually people who order light dressing.)   After our meal, when I asked which Amaros they carried, the bartender looked confused and said, \"Um... we don't have any of that.\"   I review their cocktail list and found a comprehensive list of all amari.   I mentioned, \"Oh! Fernet Branca is an amaro.\" To which she quickly rebutted, \"We're out.\"   Okay. Check please. Really? This used to be one of the most happnin places with knowledgeable staff and now...? I'll stay home and shake own martini.",

    "text": "Great hot spot in Phoenix... younger crowd with Comicon going on across the street.  Centrally located with easy parking. We were there early but the restaurant was packed.  The noise level was high and a few more plants or sound barriers would help.  It was quieter on the second floor.  The bathrooms are a must see so I will leave it out of the review, but be sure to check them out.  The food was great for the most part.  The Tuscan steak was a large portion and so two of us split it.  Cooked perfectly with a great Gorgonzola butter on top served with onion strings.  Our friends had a beautiful, large beet salad with goat cheese, covered in pistachios, served on a bed of Arugula. It was really flavorful with a light vinaigrette. The beef dip sandwich was dry and flavorless and there was no horseradish sauce that use to spice it up.  Overall we will definitely be back to try the pizzas.",

    "text": "Hanny's is a great time to go anytime of the week!  Weekend's you will likely deal with louderDJ'ed music, not the best for easily had conversations.  Their food and craft cocktails are incredible though!  I typically go with just my fiancee and we will split the Gorgonzola slaw, the Beet Salad and the Quattro Pizza!  They are all delicious.  The Moscow Mule is top-notch and I also recommend the Ginger Creek, if you like bourbon.  The only reason this review isn't 5 stars is because of Parking (you will likely pay $4-$8 during peak times in a nearby garage) and the service.  The servers are the epitome of aging hipsters who either take life & their job too seriously OR they are just miserable with their jobs altogether.  I have had several experiences that leave me wondering why management is unable to either find or retain happy servers but the food, atmosphere & drinks is enough to keep you coming back.  Nobody's perfect!",

Worst choice of my life , the atmosphere is okay older women and older men with loud music . The food was the worst part oh my , let me tell you about funky flavors . One of my cousins almost cried when he took the first bite of his sandwhich lol , let me tell you we all got the same sandwhich . It was so hard to eat like it was not good not even satisfying . I had to remove the meat and eat the meat alone after i had wiped it down with a napkin . To top it off the waiter got everyones card and charged us individually when we were done , we didnt even know we were going to pay with only 1 card ( he was tall skinny ) to top it off we told him how we felt about the food and he ignored and answered with a different response saying do you need to go bags lol , No ! The FOOD IS NASTY . What a joke . There was a restaurant in front of hannys who hands down had better service and better tasting food . 1 star for hannys . More options on the MENU ALSO . Please yall have little to no food . No options .",

Mannequins were artfully displayed, if you don't pay attention you will not notice they are mannequins and not statues. The restrooms were previously fitting rooms. Really cool space. Great looking bar in the middle of the restaurant as well.   There was a DJ playing from a sound room from above the bar. He was playing our jams! We had such a great time!   I had a Moscow Mule, it was light and tasty. Very cold, came in the classic copper cup. Love that! We also had a snack plate which was loaded with prosciutto, olives, nuts and cheese.  Really delicious prosciutto.  I also tasted the classic martini, and it is super strong. I had to sit back down.  :)  I will definitely be back to Hanny's, highly recommend.",

I was informed by our server that this was a department store from the 1940\"s until the mid 1980's, and then used for the next 20 years as a training facility for the Phoenix Fire Department. After that, it became Hanny's.  We started with a Gray Goose Cosmo and a Stella. Both were on point.  We shared a snack plate. Good stuff.  If you expect a New York style Margherita pizza, don't hold you breath. We got an oblong shaped thin crust pie that struck me as a standard pie (aside from the shape) that you could get in any New York pizzeria. Good, as in edible, but not great.  Finished of with a Tiramisu. Now this was good stuff......",

It felt like they were trying for more upscale but the food was so-so. We ordered a variety of salads and pizza's. Pizza's are big with thin crust. Our waitress brought us pizzas then salads midway through eating the pizza. She didn't seem to care. My beet salad never arrived. The waitress had an attitude for our entire experience and took no accountability that the salads came after the pizza and that one wasn't delivered but she was willing to bill us for it. More attitude than quality food or service.",

Upon walking into the entry the entire bar/restaurant seemed to look up at you.. it was a little awkward while waiting to be seated lol..  The decor was minimal and contemporary.. with the vibe and hints of AZ88 carried over. The elevator was unique.. and the bathrooms were oddly placed upstairs. This place has A LOT of potential. It needs a crowd and some color. It just didn't feel alive like AZ88 does.   The Food: The menu was minimal and easy to read. There was an assortment of appetizers, sandwiches , pizza, salads etc... My friend and I shared a sandwich and pizza.. food was good and reasonably priced.   The Service: Good friendly service. Helpful with recommendations. Fast arrival of food and plenty of refills on water.   Overall, I liked the place and would recommend it!",

You have to check it out for all the interesting features like the elevator shaft, which everyone got a kick out of as they walked by, to the bathrooms that have a little confused about how to actually get into one of them. It seems they have improved their menu as the Pork Calabrease (or something along those lines) came with onion string side and two slices of cantaloupe and tomatoes halves. My girlfriend got the Bruschetta and we both found our meals to taste great, we both agreed we would go back just for the food alone. I also had a Russin Mule cocktail which was excellent. The music was also great, had a very \"big city\" sound to it...maybe something you'd hear in San Francisco or the like. A couple of down sides were that the place seems to have a bit of a identity crisis. It's set up as a restaurant, but really there isn't that much food on the menu. It would make a great lounge with the music they have, but there aren't enough lounging seating areas...it's all dining height tables and chairs. The lighting was also too bright, more restaurant then lounge and sort of kills the mood.",

The ambiance of Hanny's is great, a old department store from the 40's-50's renovated into is new found glory today. Multi leveled with twisting stairs, a interesting bathroom area and a great elevator shaft that you can walk over!!! The interior is very sleek and refined, but very comfortable. The bar is beautiful, they have great drinks, even a Moscow Mule that comes in a real copper mug! The have great martini prices, only $5. The food selection is great, amazing salads, appetizers, pizza's &  sandwich's. I had the proscutto pizza with arugula. It was delicous. My friend had the beet salad with onion straws app. Also very good. The server we had was very attentive, professional and knew what he was doing.

    "text": "The short and simple is this: I love the food, I hate the ambiance. There something so dark and creepy about this place, almost like a building where someone's been murdered or something. I'm overcome by this awful feeling every time I enter the building and I don't think its just because its an insufferable hipster hangout. The building is a renovated department store that has several of the vestiges of its former iteration, like an old glass bottomed elevator shaft, brand name signs, etc. In theory I love places like this that honer the building's history, but this place just gets under my skin in a bad way. Like I stated up front, the food is great. They have a wonderfully creative menu and fantastic salads (Garden chopped is amazing). They also have an array of really unique cocktails. And even if you don't actually come here for dinner, its worth exploring the upstairs bathrooms which are renovated 'changing rooms.' Just don't expect it to be the most relaxing, enjoyable dinner; at least I've never found it to be.",

The menu is brief but it seems like most of the items have a lot of thought put into them and the quality seems very high.  I ordered a personal pizza, a white version with prosciutto, fontina cheese and thinly sliced apple.  The tartness of the apple was perfect foil to the saltiness of the ham and the lush cheese.  Friend got the porchetta sandwich, pork loin with cheese, olives, onions on a really toothsome artisan bread.  Delicious... I'll get one of those when we go back.  We also enjoyed the long leather sofas with reclining back, and the classical music.   Nice to know that downtown has such an appealing alternative for lunch!",

Unfortunately, the service was very poor.  We ordered a bruschetta appetizer and two meals.   The meals came and the waitress came over to apologize that she forgot to put in the appetizer. She ended up bringing it when we were 2/3 done with our meal...so, obviously not craving or hungry for it.  Regardless, she still charged us despite admitting to her mistake.  This was annoying and our tip adjusted for this poor decision.  The food was ok- nothing special. I ordered the roast beef sandwich and it was quite bland.  I think I would have rather eaten a burger at hard rock before the game, but the drinks were good.",

    "text": "Walking through downtown Phoenix, my friend and I walked upon what appeared to be an \"OG\" of Phoenix buildings.  From a distance the building alone  looked circa 1940's and proudly displayed \"Hanny's\".  I learned the building was originally a department store.  Valley residents flocked to the building for the newest and greatest of the days fashion.  The era of Hanny's Department store lasted over 30 years.  As I walked closer, large windows displayed the restaurants open floor plan and bar centrally located inside.  The windows were much like a department store displaying and advertising everything inside. As I walked into the restaurant the sound of catchy beats could be hearing prominently inside.  The restaurant decor is very inviting as you enter.  A primarily grey or chrome color dominates the inside with mirrors strategically placed around the walls. Its too bad the reputation as a premiere department store didn't follow as a restaurant.  As the decor felt welcoming the service and attentiveness lacked in substance, speed and quality.  My friend and I walked in a admired the set up, then realized where is the host?  I saw a booth commonly associated with what a host or hostess would stand behind and welcome you, but that post had been deserted.  I saw no \"please wait to be seated\" or \"seat yourself\" signs displayed.  I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.  We were greeted by, well I don't know if I'd say greeted.  Rather we were hurried to a dirty table by the employee.  Realizing the table was dirty the man apologized and disappeared.  My friend and I stood between several tables with people at them looking at us looking at them.  With the combination of people talking, music playing I wasn't sure if we were suppose to follow the employee or if he was coming back... Having all the patrons eyes staring at me I chose to move and follow the waiter, all be it 30 yards behind his speed walk. As we meandered through people eating and drinking the waiter walked back, cleaned off another table and sat us with menu's.  I literally looked at my watch to keep track of the time.   I peered over the menu which on one side displayed food and on the other displayed drinks.  I wanted a drink unique to the restaurant.  I chose the \"Moscow Mule\".   A concoction of vodka, ginger beer and sliced cucumbers sounded new and refreshing.   After sitting for about 10 minutes our waitress asked us for our drink selection.  No introduction, no greeting, just what do you want? The menu is limited but had my favorites, pizza, salads and sandwiches.  After plenty of time to look at the menu several times I decided on the Americano Pizza.  A simple combo of italian sausage, grilled mushrooms, onions, three cheese blend and tomato sauce.  After a couple bathroom trips our food arrived prior to the drinks we had ordered twenty minutes earlier. The pizza had a light thin crust with toppings evenly distributed.  The pizza was good and appropriately priced at $13.00.  I do prefer chunks of sausage rather then ground up sausage, but it did the trick for me. My drink that took 20 minutes to make was placed in a small old miners style tin cup.  Not sure how the cup fit the atmosphere or how it made the drink better, but I feel it was overpriced for the amount of liquid I received. In all I think Hanny's attracts the out of towner's staying in a hotel in the area or first time visitors like me.  Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.",

The place itself is pretty cool but trying to figure out the bathrooms made me a tad uncomfortable. When i got to go I don't want to be put thru a test...just mark the doors and be done.

    "text": "Being pretty much unknowledgable about the whole downtown scene, I figured I would check it out. Thanks to Yelp, Hanny's came to mind - so naturally I thought I would check it out. Walking in, I could already see, that thursday are far from their busiest night. Still the wait to be seated seemed to take about 10 mintues before someone even acknowledged my girl and I. But having the time to look at the place, I was somewhat impressed by their modern approach. Looking over their menu I saw it rather limited but roast beef caught my eye, while my gf got the pork seared special.  She had some sort of martini while I stuck with the Stella. I was surprised how small their martini glasses were, especially for the price. But trying to make a night out of this, I wasn't trying to complain.  The roast beef was rather tasteless and greesy and was regretful ordering it, I was rather jealous that my other half had a more enticing meal. But I still am attracted to Hanny's, maybe its the old school beats the DJ's were putting down, or the reclining seats or maybe the maze-like bathroom, or just how happy it made my girl to actually have a night out like this. But i give this place 4 stars not for the service or food, but more for the atmosphere... (and sick beats)",

Hanny's is a spacious and modern space in downtown Phoenix which used to house one of Phoenix's first department stores. The first time we came in here was because The Roosevelt has stopped serving food (a whopping two hours before they were scheduled to stop serving food) and one of their waitresses suggested we mosey on over to Hanny's instead. While the vibe is a little too corporate/ Euro-centric modern chic for me, they do have a great bar and they also have one of my favorite sandwiches in town: their prime rib sandwich with apple-wood smoked bacon, arugula, aioli, and fried egg served with crispy onion straws was delicious, but unfortunately, a little inconsistent. The meat seems to be at its best the earlier you come, but if you walk in around midnight, it can be just a little too dry. 3.5 stars rounded to 4 because of good service, nice big space, and late kitchen hours (rare for downtown).",

However, our dinner did not match up to the tasteful decor of the restaurant, in fact, taste was the problem! Who called the pizza a giant saltine? It's True! Worse, all the ingredients were dumped indifferently onto the top, and the flavors were obscured by each other! Our pizza tasted like an arugula salad slathered in Chef Boy-ar-dee tomato sauce. The drinks were a nice source of amusement. We didn't order alcohol, but when we requested refills, the waiter looked mortified and said \"I can only give you ONE!\" This place has the potential to be the \"go-to\" of downtown Phoenix, but they've got to tune up the menu, or they are going to be a big empty men's store once again!",

Drinks are pricey for being so small.  My friend's martini was more like a shot.  We had lots of different things to eat: pizzas, salad, onion strings, and the pork sandwich.  It was all good, not great but definitely good.  We all agreed that the pizza was the best thing we had.  Prices were ok, not too expensive but just on the verge for what you got for it.

We chose Hanny's because we heard it had a cool vibe and it was close to the Herberger Theater. It's an old department store, and I gotta tell you someone needs to work on the window selling because from the outside it didn't grab me. The windows actually needed to be cleaned. From the inside, the music was the best part of the place. The decor and ambiance was stark, modern, steely grey. Our eyes were drawn to the only color in the place which were the exit signs. The crowd was mixed, older and refined earlier in the night, young or young at heart) and hip later. The prosciutto is cut right in the middle of the bar, which was kind of cool to look at. We ordered the bar plate which was perfect. Prosciutto, olives, cantaloupe, bread, parm cheese. We also ordered the Parma Pizza-delicious! I could have folded the thin crust pizza up and shoved the whole thing in my mouth, that's how good it was. But, I shared. We then had a beet and arugula salad which was very lemony and tasty. Because lemon makes everything taste better. I had two glasses of syrah which were nice. My friends ordered dirty martinis which came full to the brim, dirty on the side. They had to take big gulps in order to put the dirty in-oh well. They thought they ordered the five dollar martinis but ended up being ten dollars, so read the fine print. I'd go there again, but not my fave. PS, bathrooms are unique!",

The rest of the place... not so much. I agree with everyone else: Hanny's has a great concept for a place. They left the skeleton of an old department store intact -- complete with a completely unusable second story -- but the results aren't spectacular. The restaurant looks great inside, like it should be a real classy establishment. So why are they serving pizzas here? The pies are decent, yeah, but really? Shouldn't we be getting steak here? Prime rib? A nice grouper fillet perhaps? With such a nice space and a primo location right in the heart of downtown, I'd think Hanny's could step it up in the food department. It's like this place is confused about who it wants to be: a neighborhood fare spot or a classy dining destination.",

    "text": "Think \"Sex and and the City\" meets \"Swingers\" and you'll get an idea of the vibe at Hanny's.  Now, we went at lunch, so we didn't get the full-on experience that undoubtedly takes place after the sun sets.  The big, old men's store space (the names of a couple of my favorite suit makers still hang on the walls) is kinda cool.  The menu was casual for lunch with a good number of pizzas and sandwiches.  The salads sounded kind of plain.  (Side note: how does anyone in downtown PHX compete with Bianco for pizza??)  I ordered the cabage starter salad, which was really quite good.  My panini sandwich was fine, but nothing special.  It annoyed me that they didn't have fountain sodas available, so everytime I wanted a Diet Coke they had to bring me one of these teeny 10 oz. bottles and charge me a couple bucks each for the privilege.  The server was enthusiastic and friendly, but clearly not a trained professional.  Hanny's was fine, and probably what passes for hip in downtown Phoenix.",

    "text": "AWESOME!!  We were looking for a late night dinner and luckily, this place was right across the street from our hotel. We walked by and peeked inside. Everyone was dressed nice. We decided to go in anyway and see if I could get some food to go. A manager spotted us and said hi. I thought he was going to kick us out for looking like scrubs, but instead he escorted us to some tables. He seated us at a table with a little \"occupied\" sign and took the sign away. Sweet concept. I felt like a VIP even though I was in sweats at a posh lounge. It was as if, the lounge was whispering to me \"we were expecting you, Mr. Elite Yelper\".   We ended up ordering the roast beef sandwich and a prosciutto/apple pizza. Both entrees were freakin' awesome. The sandwich had tender slices of roast beef, thick slices of smoked bacon, and a fried egg, blanketed in a soft ciabatta roll. It had a side of onion strings and some sort of phenomenal slaw. The pizza was fantastic as well. It was a white pizza, with Fontina cheese, thin slices of prosciutto, and apples. Odd combination, but it worked really well together.   The thing I like about this place is the character. The building use to be an old department store, but they managed to convert it to a lounge. The crowd here is very trendy/hipster. They had a DJ spinning some techno/hip-hop and some really trippy (but classy) decor. I like the gutted elevator shaft and the high ceilings. What kind of grossed me out is the fitting room, converted bathrooms. They're uni-sexed, but pretty disgusting. Just think about what it's like to take a dump in a fitting room with no ventilation. Yup, it's exactly what you are probably imagining.   Overall, I really liked this place. The kitchen is open pretty late, the food is excellent, there's no cover, and the food/drink prices are reasonable. The wife and I dropped about 50 bucks post tip/tax on roast beef sandwich, pizza, and two cocktails. This a great place to to start your night, but I would recommend using the restrooms at your next stop. I would definitely come back again.   A little about my credentials: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I continue to enjoy & love food.",

I have been here a handful of times each time with a large group (10+) and they have always been incredibly accommodating, the food is good, reasonably priced, portioned, and of good quality, the drinks are strong, and the servers are very attentive. Aside from the general fare, the space is really cool with lots of nooks to explore. The basement is a trip and the bathrooms are a little confusing; I walked in on someone once (oops).

Try a Moscow Mule (they have the copper mugs), or any of their other sophisticated cocktails.  The Asparagus with Egg is outstanding, but the margherita pizza is also tasty, is you're not feeling adventurous.

They spin some great tunes (look for the deejay booth above the main entrance). The upstairs bathrooms and downstairs are an awesome sight you need to check out firsthand.  Food: All the light bites we've had - pizzas, prosciutto-wrapped prawns, salads - are pretty great and reasonably priced. I consider this less of a dinner place and more a \"let's order food so we're not just drinking our meal\" place.  Drink: They have a respectable beer and wine selection and make a solid martini. Check out some of the great happy hour deals on cocktails.  tl;dr - comfortable and hip lounge with solid drinks and light bites.  ~  Disclosure: I'm a former Yelp employee.",

He just looked at us waiting for us to tell him what we'd like. Uh, rude! After our round, we got our table. We ordered 4 rounds of drinks each and dinner entrees, so you know our tan was up there. Food was great, our server was this petite gift with glasses (sorry I forgot her name), she was very attentive and nice.

The bartender seemed more interested with liquor inventory tasks than serving customers.  She had a look on her face like Sarah Huckabee Sanders during a press briefing.  She got my martini wrong and instead of pouring me another, she just tried to fix the drink, and gave it back to me. I always had to ask for service, and her poor personality didnt help either,  a shame because I really do like the vibe and style.  You would expect more from an upscale bar/restaurant.  I think the reason why customer service is not important is that Hannys is comfortable with constant regular out of town first time customers, from either neighboring hotels, or feeding off the business crowd for lunches, or trendy places to bring clients.  That being said, not your neighborhood bar, it would be nice to have staff who can complement the cool surroundings.  I give 3 stars for food and surroundings only, management needs to attract bartenders who can match the style, not beer slingers from a sports bar.",

One of my friends is a linebacker and took most of the table up himself, so we ask for a booth so that we are comfortable during our dinner. The waiter moves us but only after rolling his eyes and giving us the silent treatment. W t f?  Then we order our food and I ask if they can make the blt I planned to eat without bread just lettuce, you know like a bun less sandwhich/burger. The waiter says they cannot do it. So I ask for extra lettuce on my blt so that i can do it myself. Nope. No extra lettuce when it came out. Another friend of mine asked for ketchup for their string onions, never came out.  I've been to Hannys in the past and never dealt with such elitist attitudes from the staff. Needless to say I won't be back, too bad because when they had djs it was a chill spot to sip drinks at, but it isn't the only one!",

    "text": "Came here for the absinthe, stayed for the atmosphere. So apparently they have a second floor now which has a gigantic unisex bathroom which is beyond beautiful. It's a large, open, white, glossy room with seperate rooms surrounding it, it almost feels like a fun house. The locks show vacant or occupied like in an airplane's bathroom. Beyond this massive open bathroom is a hallway with more fun. LED lit mirrors with narrow couches paralleling them. Quite a fun area you definitely have to explore if you come here.  Anyways to the absinthe! We ordered the Grand Absente Absinthe (138 proof) from France for $11. They properly poured it using the sugar cube and water method which was lovely to see! The staff was also very kind and patient throughout our order and questions. Also, I love that the mixologists wear white lab coats! Gives off the impression that they're scientists. The absinthe was given to us in beautiful crystal goblets and it tasted just as divine, like soft and light licorice gumdrops! If you like lemon drop shots or something similar to those then this is for you, it really tasted like candy. Now we didn't hallucinate,  just had a light buzz as you do with most hard liquors. Will definitely be back for more!",

    "text": "The ambiance of the restaurant is great! We loved the feel and energy- however the service completely deteriorated the overall perspective of Hanny's. Upon being sat we received the menus, the server came over about 10 minutes later offering to bring us water while we waited for our guests to arrive. We waited an additional 10 minutes to receive water and without hesitation were immediately rushed into \"are we ready to order.\" Unfortunately, that set the tone for the rest of the evening. The most memorable part of the evening was sitting for 20 minutes with an empty water glass. Service as a whole was extraordinarily slow, and completely in-personable. The food was delicious, hence the 2 star rating. Overall, I do not feel any inclination to come back or refer friends and business associates to Hanny's- especially with so many vibrant and fun restaurants in the neighborhood that offer immeasurably better service.",

The music is awful; it was very stressful and I found I couldn't even relax throughout our entire experience here.     Drinks and food.  Drinks were very good.   Ordered three margaritas very tasty and strong.   Ordered an ice tea and it was very flavorful however it was never refilled.  Food was soooo tasty.   Ordered the shrimp appetizer and it was very very good.  4 pieces for 15.00.  Orders the Marx salad and a carne pizza.   It created smiles all around our table.  Very tasty.    Servers.  Very short attitude not very personable at all.  Asked what he recommended and he said uh well the pizza is good I mean I don't know what do you want to drink beside water.   Seemed like he would rather go back to the bar which is the main attraction and socialize with the rest of the employees.  So many people work here!   So I started this review as a four and it dropped to three stars.   Service is huge!     Up your service and you get 4 stars.   Food and drinks awesome.  Change the creepy music and get a 5 star.  I will not be back.",

    "text": "Hanny's is most definitely a hit or miss kind of place.  I've been only twice in my 4 years here.  My first time, 3 years ago it was a compete miss.  My second go 'round it was a hit.  On my most recent visit I went with about 11 other people from my meetup group.  We did not have reservations but were able to sit directly next to each other with 2 tables.  It was pretty busy on this Saturday night and the service wasn't the best.  We saw our server 3 times.  Once to take our drink orders, once to take our food orders and once to bring us our checks once we flagged her down.  Again, it was pretty busy but that was my issue the first time I tried Hanny's. It was busy then, but I was a party of one severely neglected.  No difference this time.   I, along with 3 other people sitting at my table ordered the BLT.  Nothing to brag about here .... It's a super regular BLT.  The bacon was cold, hard and old. The sandwich had maybe 4 pieces of bacon on it.  The bread was toasted but cold.  We think the food may have sat back there for a while before our server was able to bring it out to us.  I don't remember what kind of sanwhich everyone else ordered but again, nothing to brag about.  The drinks however were really good.  A few of us went with the Classic Manhattan.  I'm a Manhattan and Old fashioned drinking girl.  It was GOOD!  Hanny's seems like more of a place for drinks with friends before catching a show, party or concert downtown.  That's what we did.  I do not think it's a place to visit just because you're hungry and want something good.  I really don't think it's that kind of place.",

The restaurant was super clean, and initial entrance everyone was super friendly.   A group of Five of us came in before John Mayer concert - we were lead to The Hanny for the $5 Martini by one of the concert goers in our group  - and it was the best $5 Martini I've ever had.  The price was right. Also tried from the Menu had the Bianco Pizza which was pretty darn delicious perfect amount of spices and heat. Reminder the Pizza is a thin crust - very thin crust.   Service- Service was slow I'm not sure if it was because it was busy for an event downtown or not - but hard to order additional drinks and trying to get our check to leave was a bit challenging.    Will definitely try again just for ambiance and $5 Martini",

Understandably, the place was busy. We waited in line to speak to the host. The two men in front of us clearly put their name on the list and we overheard the host  telling them they could hang out at the bar while they waited.  As soon as we approached the host, he was clearly very overwhelmed. We told him it would be just the two of us. He began to explain their was a concert (we knew) and the place would not clear out until after the concert started and he already had 13 or so people on his list. He didn't offer to take our name or suggest sitting at he bar, he really just seemed to be saying, no, you can't eat here.  It was one of the most awkward and rude situations I've encountered in the service industry. I hope that's not how Hannys operates, but I doubt I will go back to find out.",

This place is a favorite among my friends and I and we love ending our night here. There's always great music and the staff is efficient and quick most of the time. The host was great this past weekend. We stopped by around 10pm on Saturday and they couldn't accommodate a 9-top so we split into two groups. It was too bad we couldn't sit together but we opted for the split so we could all enjoy the great food and drinks then head out to another bar to dance. Definitely will be back and every time I recommend this place to someone, they become an addict themselves.",

That said, this was my first experience at  Hanny's and it will be my last.  We were looking for a nice place to spend New Years.  When we decided upon Hanny's we knew we would have to wait, so when we arrived at 8:00 pm and was met with a 2 hour wait we were not surprised, what we were surprised by was the extremely rude host/manager who greeted us saying with a snarl something along the lines of \"this is new years and your going to have to wait\".  Needless to say it set the tone for the evening and the service.  We actually ended up waiting for around 30 minutes for a table.  When the host/manager came over and tapped me on the shoulder saying \"how many people did you have?\"  in a rude way.  Whatever, so we sat.  The service was slow but good. The waiter was nice and treated us very well.  Up until 11:20pm that is....  At this point our server disappeared along with our great service. In my opinion most restaurants would be happy your choosing their establishment to bring in the new year right?  Not Hanny's.   Though we had hoped for champagne to toast the New Year we sat there with a cleared off table (the bus people did a great job) trying to flag down any server while we see the tables around us drinking champagne.    At around 12:15 am I was finally able to flag down the host/manager, he lived up to his prior rudeness, by basically shrugging off my complaint in a rude way and saying \"what do you expect it's New Year's Eve\"?  I'll spare the nasty details that went on after.  Well...If you can't showcase your restaurant on a special night like that I am certainly not coming back on \"normal\" night.  Thanks for making for a night to remember Hanny's!",

    "text": "For me, Hanny's was quite the odd find in Phoenix. It's the type of lounge you'd expect to find in LA, Manhattan, or some other metropolitan city. Being that I just moved back to Phoenix from LA, I was pleasantly surprised and relieved to find something that would help my transition from the City of Angels.  To be completely honest, you go to Hanny's for the atmosphere and the drinks. The food isn't great but the salads and appetizers are decent. I've yet to try out much of the drink menu but the gin and tonic as well as the gimlets that they make are pretty solid. That being said, the bartenders are really cool guys and make sure you're taken care of. The DJ's that spin on the weekends are also pretty good; however, they play alot of ambient or lounge type music so don't go there and expect to cut a rug like at Homme.  Overall, this place is pretty spot on to take a date or just to chill out. Hanny's is truly a rare find in Phoenix and I hope to stop by more often.",

Bartenders are fine so sit at the bar if you don't want some bitchy server to take your half full mojito because she is in a hurry to leave. The shorter male server is awesome, if only he would teach the others his ways. They don't split the tab either, so not good for groups. So much potential, work on it hannys.",

The menu is not very extensive and the food was as exquisite as I had hoped. The drink selection on the other hand was not too expensive and had a large selection of cocktails, which is the reason this gets a 3 star instead of a 2 or 1 star rating. The bathroom situation was pretty confusing at first but once you understand how they work, it makes sense. The DJ played some good music and the place was nicely setup, but for food, don't expect a lot of choices.",

Lunch was FANTASTIC. My son had the Carne pizza which was a pepperoni, ham, and sausage very thin crust oval shaped pizza. It could have been a bit cheesier, however, it was crispy and very tasty. One of our friends had the Prosciutto di Parma pizza which has prosciutto, arugula, shaved parmesan and was just delish with a spritz of balsamic on top. Friend 2 had the veggie sandwich which had portabello mushrooms, grilled onions on ciabatta and I had the BLT which is kind of a standby sandwich for me when I want to see how good a place is. If you can't make a good BLT, then don't bother. It was toasty with crispy bacon and was just delish. I enjoyed it with the gorgonzola slaw which is a coleslaw with gorgonzola cheese and pistachios. It was very tasty.   Service was good...drinks kept filled and friendly servers. Restaurant was spotlessly clean and I am looking forward to going back soon!",

We sat at the bar since it was just 3 of us. The bartender was super nice offering explanations of any and all drinks.. I had a try of the absinthe. Definetly an acquired taste, very earthy and strong. My friends tried the spiked lemonade and mojito. Prices were kinda high, but for downtown makes it seem reasonable. They had a cool DJ playing some chill beats. We didn't try food here but found others ordering small pizzas that looked pretty good. I would recommend this place just to grab a drink and hang out.. its worth it for the eclectic atmosphere.",

    "text": "Thin crust pizza, not as oily as La Grande Orange's, that holds its form through eating. The toppings preserve their distinction from the local alternatives, e.g. Cibo (less savoury), while not going so far down the path of differentiation so as to render a product uniquely useless.  Yet the True reward for going came with dessert - we tried the lemon meringue. The meringue itself was sharply tart, with the sweetness serving to ensure the tartness wasn't harsh and nothing more. This is perfect! Too many places have prima donna sugar that tries to overpower the lemon. We tried it with a traditional crust (which I preferred due to it preserving the tartness and lemoniness of the meringue) and a graham crust (which my friend preferred for being easier to eat [the graham crumbles] as well as buffering the tart notes of the meringue).  A star is missing for the ambiance - wait staff were very friendly, but the venue was empty. Low windows, low lighting, as well as no street-level windows on neighbouring buildings contributed to the sense of isolation. That might add to its charm though, which carries a sense of timelessness.",

    "text": "I ate here two nights in a row on a recent business trip to Phoenix. The first night I was eating a bit later (after a post flying nap in the room) so the restaurant/bar was pretty empty at 9pm. I had the prosciutto and pear pizza and a nice glass of Malbec. The wine was great and at $6.75 a glass, not too pricey. The pizza was really good, however, they got a little overly zealous with the cheese, so I picked a little of that off. The manager apparently noticed and asked about it and I commented that it was great but had just a bit too much cheese. He replied \"Oh I hate when they do that\". End of conversation, I am reading my book here, I am happy, I have some dessert coming. Flash to the end of my meal and my check comes and he had comped it off. I was so taken aback and pleased as I had ate half of it and honestly I mean picking a little extra cheese off is no skin off my teeth. The bartender was super sweet, she gave me directions to the local movie theater, checked back on everything that came to me, etc. The second night, I had the same style of service, just a steak and ice tea this time. It was cooked to order (medium rare) and the manager came over again to say hi. In the service industry this known as a \"table touch\" and I was just really impressed. Their homemade donuts are like crack, much more like a beignet in terms of taste and preparation style. I was thinking of them fondly as I jogged on the hotel's treadmill the next morning.   The restaurant is very visually appealing, I loved the music they were playing, the food was good, and the customer service was above and beyond. I would definately recommend this place.",

We sat at the bar and the bartenders were very friendly and super attentive.  I'll come back just for drinks and the service.   The food, eh, not so much.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things... We shared a brushetta and it had a taste in it I did not like.  It was good except the overwhelming olive taste.  If you like olives, you'll love the brushetta.  We then shared the Proschiutto di Parma pizza.  I love proschiutto but their's had to have been cured with a pound of salt because I've never had prosciutto as salty as this and I realize that proschiutto is a salty meat.  There was also a lot more arugula on the pizza than I expected.  I thought just a sprinkling, maybe; but ended up with enough for each of us to have a side spring salad.  I couldn't taste the sauce or cheese on the pizza.  I could just taste salt and arugula.  Total bummer. Like I said before though, great service and atmosphere worth coming back for.  I know I'll be back for drinks and will try something else to give them a chance at redeeming the reputation that preceeded my visit.",

I really like the music, it's sort of upbeat but chill Trip Hop -ish, and the volume is loud enough to hear it, but not so loud where you have to shout to be heard by your companions. You can actually carry on a conversation here.  The building itself is cool, a re-appropriated department store with a spooky basement below and fancy restrooms upstairs. The vaulted ceilings in the main room and calm lighting lend to a relaxed, airy vibe to the place.  The food is delicious. The flatbread (pizzas really) creations are really outstanding. Great size to share a nosh with you friends; or big enough to make a meal for yourself. The drinks are top-shelf. The Vieux Carre Absinthe they carry is highly recommended.",

Although we were seated promptly on a Saturday night our server was genuinely not interested in being there.  Barely spoke and not a smile to be had when I said \"HI! How's it going?\"  We were given waters, the other person dining with me asked for lime and a straw, I did not, so when the server came back, thats all that was provided, even though one would think that the server would have asked if another straw was needed or just place one there anyway!  In my experience as a regular diner and being in the service industry its like a given.  Ok onto the food, we ordered the Bar Plate and a standard BLT, I know that sounds ridiculous and boring but its what I wanted!  When the food came out the Bar plate came out first then the sandwich was delivered on 2 separate plates, I thanked the server for being so kind, little did I know what was to come later.  The Bar Plate comes with fresh prosciutto, parmigiana cheese, both green and black olives, pistachios, melon and bread. I felt that the bread was stale, but my dining partner said it was ok.  The BLT was good, bacon crispy and they lettuce and tomatoes were fresh and they use just the right amount of mayo (Hellmans). So now we wait for the bill, instead of the server walking around to our table, she leans across from behind me, from the walking aisle, to place the bill on the table, geez, would it kill you to walk a few extra steps?  I look at the bill and notice  $2 charge for splitting the sandwich!!!!!  Uh Um, I never asked for it to be split, she assumed we would have wanted it that way, and here I thought she was being nice, no, she was still the same server we had in the beginning.  When I asked about the charge she said, well werent you going to share it?  I said not necessarily, we ordered 2 dishes and they came out at different times, we didnt ask for it to be that way.  She said well you shared it anyway.  WHAT!!!!!  Ok its $2 but its really not ok to just assume these things and maybe had she used her words and told us about this we would have said something.  So overall, food good, service bad.  Would want to go back but with so many other options with better service and good food, why bother.",

I planned on just having a cocktail but their menu was so enticing I had to order something. To drink I got the Original Pimm's Cup {Pimm's No. 1 liqueur, ginger beer, orange & cucumber wedge} and it was too legit. For an entree I opted for the BLT Supremo {hard boiled egg & sharp provolone} on sourdough. I took it to go (my guest had an early bedtime). It traveled well and was a very tasty twist on the classic BLT. I took some for lunch at work the next day and it might have been even better. Side note: sometimes us RNs get lunch breaks! I don't know if I was just craving greasy food or what, but the real stand out of the meal was the fried onion strings it was served with it. I haven't had such delicious, fried, tasty goodness in a long time! Think Bloomin Onion x10! I'm getting hungry just thinking about them!",

Was downtown for Comicon and I thought it would be a bastion of peace and harmony and good food. The appetizer was good but the pizza was bland and flavorless, greasy and near inedible. You know they told me when I said I didn't like it? \"That's our best pizza\"! No offering to take any money off or get me anything else.  I was surprised both by the sauce which tasted like it came straight from a tomato sauce can and the amazingly poor service. I left all the pizza there. An overpriced lesson!",

The waiter essentially refused to serve me three of my drink choices, saying they would be \"too strong\" for me.  Maybe they didn't feel like making them that night?  I finally was allowed to order a champagne cocktail.  My colleague ordered the Moscow Mule, and they held her credit card in exchange for he copper cup... Which was fine until we had to track it down at the end of the night and the waiter totally forgot he even had it.  The food choices were limited, so I went with the small snack plate with some meats and cheeses.  A few people at the table had the pork scallopini and didn't particularly like it, saying the sauce was awful.  The bruschetta was also laced with black and green olives which was unexpected.  Overall, service was slow and disinterested, and the food was nothing to write home about.  I'd rather check out Phoenix's other downtown bars before returning here.",

Finally after 45 minutes and asking twice the water glass was refill...once. It seems there is a policy against leaving a pitcher at the table, so a no win situation. We ordered 70 minutes after being seated.  Our food came 25 minutes later. We asked for our check and said we need to leave right now.  15 minutes later we got our cards back.   The food...mediocre steak (overcooked, ordered medium and first cut showed no pink at all) with 5 small potato wedges.  Certainly not worth the $25 paid.  Sad to say, but better service can be had at any fast food joint and Outback can at least get the temperature right.",

I know it might seem kind of pricy but if you like drink like I like drink you will know that these prices are just right. English Garden? Yes please. Absinthe? Yes please. And you cannot beat a 5 dollah martini! Your choice gin or vodka. Or a petite for you lightweights at 2.50.   I do vaguely recal having the delicious BLT or at least a bite of one the last time I was here late night after a show at Crescent. LATE NIGHT! During the week none the less. I love that Downtown is starting to have some life again! Woohoo!",

This place used to be an textile building... they did a great job recreating it as a bar/restaurant venue. You walk in and the bar is fashioned in a modern block horseshoe shape. This specialty cocktail bar has a great list of original and classic cocktails... I would recommend either a Negroni or a french 75 depending on your preferred flavor profile. On top of their extensive libation knowledge, the bartenders have fantastic charisma which equals a great time up at the bar whether you're alone or with a few people.  Also, this place has a very interesting food menu... things from charcuterie plates, cheese plates, flat breads, fresh vegetables and of course my favorite: The prosciutto wrapped shrimp with fresh greens, tomatoes, and grated cheese. Their flat breads are mighty tasty... probably the prociutto or the margarita are the two best. They are a must try.  And all the while you are enjoying conversation, food and drinks, there is a dj that plays the best music. It could be anything from hip hop, to old school to dance music. This posh and modern bar is open just the warehouse would have been but it definitely got a facelift to match the ambiance whatever genius came up with.  PS- If you have to use the restrooms and you're drunk... good luck! PSS- If you're feeling brave, try walking down into the basement for a creepy little window into the insane genius of this place.",

We were there at the beginning of December and their Christmas decorations were pretty and also a bit unique.  The food was very good and we happened to walk up just as they opened for dinner, so we were seated very quickly.  I guess that due to the concert later, the place was packed and quite noisy by the time we were through.  I felt like the service was a bit slow for such a popular restaurant.  We had a longer than expected wait for our food to arrive after we ordered, and another wait (about 15 minutes) to order our dessert, and waited again for our check when we were through.  Fortunately we were not in a hurry and it gave us a chance to visit.  I also found it odd that they serve soft drinks in bottles/cans, instead of from a dispenser in their bar.",

The cauliflower had a good spicy kick, the shrimp prosciutto were large and flavorful, and the pizza had so much meat.

I told the woman who answered where I was sitting and exactly where it was. She placed me on hold. When she returned to the line she informed that she could not find the necklace. So I then walked over to the establishment no more than 10 min later and found my necklace exactly where I told her it would be. While this is not a review based on the actually food, this review is based solely on the customer service. The woman who answered was rude, she did not actually look and that to me is disturbing. I will probably not return to this establishment anytime soon.",

    "text": "At long last, I'm finally writing a review for Hanny's. I don't even want to count how many times I've visited over the past (almost) two years...   I had actually never been there until a certain someone took me by to show me \"the basement.\" Strange, yes, but we stopped by real quick and checked out the interesting physical features Hanny's has to show off. If you haven't been downstairs, go check it out ;) The bathrooms are cool too, of course, and I believe they used to be fitting rooms back when it was a department store. Very cool use of the spaces in the building. The elevator shaft is cool too, if you're not scared of heights!  That first visit was an interesting one. At first glance, this place seems way too classy for me. Since we didn't grab anything to eat or drink the first few times we stopped by, I had no idea what the food/drink side of things was like (seriously, we just stopped in to show different people the basement and the restrooms... we're weird, maybe, but who cares? It's such a cool space!) I had assumed the standard upscale cocktails and plates most places that look and sound like Hanny's offer.   The LED lighting was interesting, at least, and the layout of the bar/dining area was pretty cool. The fascinating seating/couches they have in some loungier areas were also cool touches. I honestly didn't know I'd love this place as much as I ended up loving it when I finally ate there. By the way, the booth seating reclines. I scared myself the first time I leaned back ;)  When I finally did go there to grab a bite to eat, I was surprised by the prices. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced and sized. The flatbreads are quite large, as are the salads. The fried onion appetizer is also massive. We order the small -- so delicious! -- and it's enough for 4 people and then some. I don't want to know what the large is like. Seriously, though, those salads are also massive. For a nice place like this, the prices are absolutely fantastic.   I need to also dedicate an entire novel to the flatbreads. I've since brought dozens of people here, and most of them agree with me -- the margarita pizza flatbread is incredible. It's that sauce. It must be. There must be something special in there... because we're all addicted now. I will lie in bed at night thinking about that pizza. I wake up craving it. What do they do!? :) The other flatbreads are also delicious, but 9 times out of 10 I'll order the margarita. The veggie is also a solid choice. It has loads and loads of delicious veggies on it, and I've even shared it with some people who generally hate veggie pizzas. They end up enjoying this one! :)  This is also one of the few places (Bitter & Twisted may be the only other legit option) I'll order a martini. Their all-day $5 martinis are absolutely amazing. Such a great price, too. I expect a disgusting, watered down martini for that price, but they do not skimp on the gin (or vodka, I guess, if you go that route ;) They also put delicious olives in there. The good stuff! Usually, you can also request blue cheese stuffed olives too. Yum! I usually don't like martinis, but they're pretty great here! Most of the time, I'll stick to beer. Their other cocktails are great, too, and they also serve the only aviation I've ever enjoyed. Highly recommended! (Thanks to a great coworker and friend who recommended this one to me!)  The service is also always fantastic. Everyone is friendly and welcoming, and the service is generally fast and efficient. No complaints here at all. Every waiter we visit there has done an admirable job. They're probably sick of seeing us so often, but that's okay ;)  By the way, the small details are what really make this place one of my favorites. Many of the original design details from the department store are still there, and they're really cool to gaze at while hanging out. I also love how the DJ pops up later in the evening -- they have this space above the entrance, likely where the dept. store manager's office used to be (?); what at one moment looks like a solid wall suddenly becomes an open space. A panel is opened (or removed?) and suddenly you can see the DJ and his entire setup in that space above the door. It's pretty cool! I want to catch them setting up. There is so much going on, usually, that I always miss the transition. One second, it's a wall; the next, it's a DJ! :P  I will say, though, that sometimes the lighting can be a bit intense (or too dim), and the music can sometimes get a little loud. It's a fun place, and it's generally pretty chill and relaxed, but sometimes the music can make you feel like you're at a night club. Most of the time, it's great music -- very diverse! I often hear lots of songs I love that I'm not used to hearing in public spaces, which is a bonus :) Just... sometimes I wish they'd turn the volume down a bit. Otherwise, 10/10 would eat there again. And again. And again... forever.",

We had a vegetarian in the group and our experience could've been better. We ordered dishes that specifically were vegetarian, such as the Cauliflower Calabrese. The ingredients are all vegetables with no indication of any meat at all. After eating it, the flavor was off so we asked what went into this seemingly vegetarian app. We learned that the veggies were soaked and marinated in beef broth! This is a little misleading when the ingredients are literally 4 vegetables. Please please be warned that you need to ask if a vegetable dish at Hanny's is vegetarian! I don't feel like the restaurant was being deceiving, but they should CLEARLY mark vegetarian dishes on their menu or CLEARLY mark their ingredients.",

Not that big of a deal, we can work with it. Shit happens, it was a busy Friday night. But then the bartender/server was super rude- came by maybe 4 times, she never asked any new guests if they wanted anything, or stuck around long enough for anyone to ask. She also never mentioned an auto grat to anybody?? Thankfully one of us caught it at the end because we would have all tipped extra not knowing (wouldn't be a big deal had she actually given good, even average service). She dropped the closed checks and literally never came back after a few people asked for boxes. I asked the host (manager maybe?) on the way out if they did auto grat's and he said only for groups of 6 or more. It's always a common courtesy to at least let your guests know, and definitely don't take it as an opportunity to ghost your table and give bad service. You potentially could have gotten an extra tip since we're literally all in the industry and always take care of our people, especially when we know we were a pain in the ass. I won't name, names- you know who you are   Food was good though. The stars are for the kitchen.",

It was thin crust and very spicy, which is weird considering I hate thin crust pizza and super spicy food??  Despite that, I am somehow in love with the Bianco pizza.

So here's why they only received the 2 stars. Last night I decided to celebrate my birthday there with about 12-13 people. BIG MISTAKE!!!! The server acted like he did not want to serve us and took 15 minutes to get any type of condiments for our food after it had already arrived. Mind you, we asked 2 different people. Drinks were empty, including our waters. Food came out promptly though. This place was not that busy for him to neglect us. Called the manager over and he could give to shats about it smh. My party asked if there was a birthday dessert that they offer, he said no. The best he said he can do (with frustration) was \"a dessert and I'll stick a candle in it.\" RUDE!!!! The terrible server still got the automatic gratuity despite his crappy service...unbelievable! Didn't even get a comped birthday drink. I've been here before so I know it's not all of the servers but the treatment from the server that night as well as the manager was a HUGE disappointment. It's a shame when I have to apologize to my table for the service when the staff wouldn't.",

    "text": "Hanny's is a sister restaurant of AZ88--one of my all time favorite places to eat, drink and hang out. It's no surprise that I found Hanny's to be equally provokative, hip and delicious.   The restaurant is located in what used to be a high-end mens department store The interior is chic and modern, yet also very classic. When I was sitting in lounge, I felt as thought I was thrown back to the 80's, but in a good way. I was also very much reminded of the mind bending architecture of AZ88 with the upper story DJ booth and crazy bathrooms upstairs (a must visit spot if you dine here).   The menu offers something for everybody. Pizza, sandwiches, salads and fancy appetizer plates. Even the pickiest eater could find something to eat there. The prices are also very reasonable--I've been to far less chic and attractive places and been blown away by the sky high prices (hem hem, FnB). The full bar also boasts a unique martini menus (like AZ88), and wine is available by the carafe (LOVE that).  I had the veggie pizza, which was a huge thin crust (definitely sharable for 2) and very generously topped with veggies. I washed it down with a carafe of the Malbec-Syrah blend, which I'd recommend to red wine lovers who prefer sweeter wines. I also recommend the donuts for dessert, which I read as a tip on Foursquare. The mini donuts look and taste nothing like real donuts--they're basically fried pieces of fluffy-textured dough covered in cinnamon and sugar. The strawberry pureed donut dip was delicious--I could have eaten a dozen of them if I had no self control.   Overall, I dig this place, and would probably frequent it if I lived closer to downtown Phoenix.",

I have had lunch here, cocktails in the evening, and late nite snacks. Most of the food is Italian themed from the apps, to the cocktails, to the beers.   Today I had the Porchetta sandwich, which was grilled pork, sopressetta, gooey cheese, onions and black olives (my new favorite thing) on ciabatta bread. Some fresh cantaloupe and cherry tomatoes as a garnish and fried onion strings on the side. It was delicious. Paired that with a beer (Italian's do few things WORSE than beer) and my lunch was $15-and-change. On the pricey side, but it was tasty.   Cocktail hour is the way to go though. $5 martini's and a whole host of other interesting/delicous cocktails they have are great (Absinthe anyone?). The late snacks are awesome. They do these little donuts with strawberry and chocolate sauce that are amazing!   Overall Hanny's is a really cool place to hang out if you're downtown, with a great atmosphere and fabulous cocktail menu. And, as it turns out, their food items are rather tasty as well.",

    "text": "200th review! And on the last day of December 2008, of all days. 2008 was a great year for Phoenix Yelp but not for Phoenix itself as one local business after another closed its doors and efforts to revitalize downtown didn't do so well. Anyone who attended the downtown pub crawl can attest to that.   I really believe that 2009 can be a better year for Phoenix, though, and I think that the light rail being open (and creating a flow up and down the central corridor) will definitely help. The other thing I think will help is entrepreneurs like Karl Kopp (the owner of Hanny's) being willing to take risks and open businesses that may not necessarily fit the cookie cutter mold of what a \"cool\" Phoenix establishment should be. I really applaud him for that.   In some sense, opening a business that's different than what people are used to or expect helps you create a cult following--not everyone will like you, but if enough people refuse to listen to the other people who don't like you, you will create a pretty passionate crowd of supporters. I really think that Hanny's will gain this type of cult following and then over time, as similar types of businesses gain a footing in Phoenix, it will become a place everyone accepts. Or that won't happen and I'll pray that enough people start to see the magic so that Hanny's won't be the next business to close!  In case you think that I only like Hanny's because it's different or new, I want to emphasize that I also really liked the food and drinks my husband and I tried. Yes, the martinis were small (my husband had the special Hanny's martini with vodka and gin and I had a French martini), but they were mixed well and at only $5, my husband's was well priced for the size.   We also both thought the food was really well executed. We especially loved the pizza with prosciutto and arugula. The crust was definitely too thin even for \"Roman style\"--having been to Rome five times, I can tell you that the crust there has a bit more substance to it, but the ingredients on Hanny's pizza were simple and fresh, which I know to be an authentically Italian approach to pizza making. But I can see how you might be disappointed if you are used to very saucy and savory pizza. The pork loin sandwich was also really good--the thinly sliced pork was very flavorful and the bread was nice and crusty. The green peppers were a bit strange, though, as they made the pork taste more Mexican inspired than Italian.   That being said, though, I'm kind of content overall to not try to force Hanny's into a box. What I like about the place is its slight imperfections and its inability to be easily defined. Is it a bar? a restaurant? a lounge? I don't really know, but I don't really care. I think its unique character make it a great destination for those who are looking for something different in Phoenix, and I hope that it survives the economic slump that the city has been going through. If it does, maybe it will expand its offerings and become a place that everyone can appreciate.",

    "text": "After Happy Hour last Friday the J-Man and I found ourselves not in the mood to go home, but in the mood to continue our fun out in downtown Phoenix. After meeting with 2 of the most bad ass Yelpers at our place- Stevey P and Mr. K- we headed out to Hanny's to meet with more of Yelp's best- Bonnie G., Erica O., and Lauren V. Hanny's proved to be a fun and interesting place for us to relax.   We didn't try any of the food since we had eaten earlier but we sampled the drinks and explored the space. I ordered up a mojito, which came with an unexpected dark rum float on the top. It was strong on the liquor but not on the mint. Perhaps next time I'll try a mai tai. After that I sampled a drink brought over from AZ88, the Moscow Mule, which was very nice and refreshing. The bar area is nice and large, the bartenders friendly. The prosciutto slicer in the middle is, um, well its odd.   The space is incredible. There are so many areas to explore, nooks and crannies to find. Some are cool (room of light and mirrors, white room, upstairs balcony, front part of the upstairs that overlooks Adams) some are creepy (the elevator shaft freaked me out, the stairs up to who knows wherea) However, its clear that the space was a department store. The central bar on the main floor was obviously the cosmetics counter and my husband kept getting whiffs of a floral smell, which I have to assume was the ghost of a crazy perfume lady past.   I think Hanny's has great potential...there are no other places like it downtown. It just needs people. So please, everyone go there. When do you hear me say that in a Yelp review? Never. But Hanny's is within walking distance of my place and could be a great destination downtown when one wants to enjoy a night at a nice lounge.",

I would imagine this place packed full if it were in NYC. I was there last Friday and I loved the vibe that the DJ created while he chose to spin soulful R&B. It was great. Our server, Tyrone, was a rock star. He handled our large group without a problem and he was quick with the service. Everyone at the table decided to order something and then pass it around. I had the pizza with pepperoni and onion, which was tasty. I think everything was great. The loser of the evening was the onion strings. I really wouldn't waste your time unless you were madly craving a whole plate of onion strings. I know people have complained about the teeny-tiny martinis. Don't judge too quickly. Those little things actually pack a good punch.  What I don't love is the VERY limited and unimaginative menu. Listen up people, you can only do thin crust pizzas, and paninis at so many places before the trend wears out. Hanny's menu is so limited that I couldn't see myself going to eat there very often because I would be eating the same things. I really hope they expand their menu. Maybe offer a nightly special? Is that asking too much?   I will most certainly go to Hanny's again. I don't know if I would go for dinner necessarily, but it's a great place to start the night out in Downtown Phoenix!",

    "text": "Hanny's is two things..and neither at full potential.  1st, it is very chic and modern in a retro feel. as far the the interior style and potential i give it 5 stars. i was told the basement will be a full blown dance club in the future. but for now..this place is completely underused. there is a second bar upstairs, but on a friday night i counted more open tables then filled ones..so clearly the second bar is premature.  2nd, the pizza tastes good, the flavor i thought was there. but give me a fucking break, 17 bucks for a crispy saltine baked at 600 degrees with some toppings...  drinks were strong..saving grace on the menu side of this review. but i think the pricing is seriously out of wack for what you get.  no free birthday dessert...better and lesser places have no problem doing this. hell if i was a server..i would have compped it either way..it was a table of 10 people drinking and my tip alone was 40 bucks. not to mention the unrequested table bread....that was put on my bill..WHAT THE FUCK!!!  it will be awhile before i come back to Hanny's  like i said the potential for a 5 star awesome place is there. but seriously the clown menu needs some revisions..if you want to charge this much for dining, get a real menu deserving of it. hopefully the wait staff too. at one point in the night i saw 3 servers standing around by the main entrance. look busy asshole.   coolest thing would be the DJ nest over the dining area. also the bathrooms, which i believe used to be dressing rooms. i can totally see some awesome carnal experiances in these private bathrooms. but i think it's kinda weird the bathrooms are 20 feet from the upstairs bar..and in line of sight...  Hanny's i wish you the best..and hope you can grow up to be what you want to be. send me a kite when you do..i look forward to hearing from you.",

    "text": "My 4 stars for Hanny's are driven almost completely by the atmosphere of this converted department store. A friend and I met up for drinks there last Friday, and lingered for around 5 hours (another friend was flying in from NYC and his flight was delayed several times, so the rounds kept coming).   Several people have commented negatively on the service, lighting or music, but they must be working out the kinks with all of the above because they were spot-on during our visit. The DJ was spinning a combination of subtle vibe-enducing music mixed with \"oh, I LOVE this song\" uncovered and unexpected old favorites. The lighting gradually shifting during the evening, so that by midnight it was a cozy and romantic mood.   Speaking of, let me just say it: something about this place just felt...sexy. I don't know if it was the music, the lighting, the \"baby it's cold outside\" week before Christmas, or my malbec-shiraz. The things-could-happen-here feel especially hit me when I went upstairs and saw the unisex restrooms all lined up; white unmarked doors all in a row to their own little rooms -- it was straight out of a Madonna video circa 1995!   Biggest watchout: the martini glasses were offensively and ridiculously tiny. I mean, really?!? I had read about this in reviews before going, but I was so shocked at the size that I refused to order one and stuck with wine (which I wouldn't say was a \"healthy\" pour, but at least took me more than 4 sips to finish). The menu is also relatively limited. We shared the bar plate and a prosciutto pizza (added mushrooms) and enjoyed both, but neither were outstanding or very filling.   All-in-all, I will definitely recommend this place to friends for drinks or drinks/apps. It's a unique space with a great vibe and I am sure it will do well once word gets out.",

    "text": "Well hello.  I'm back.  And I see that Pierre Trudeau ran home to be the first to review Hanny's after bailing on me while I still had a drink in hand (even though I was the one who convinced him to go that evening in the first place). That's ok, though. I've already given him shit.   So, anyway, what do we got here? A big giant space that's opened up downtown. And I've had a few return trips, so I'm ready to review. Let's get to work:  POSITIVES - It's obvious that some massive investment went on here in redefining a decrepit department store into a giant, contemporary lounge.  A sleek seating area downstairs and there's also a second floor. More floors to eventually open, which would make Hanny's practically an epic city unto itself - if the crap-ass economy doesn't devour it first. - Also upstairs: your own personal Hall of Mirrors - in case you missed the illustrious Arizona State Fair - and an all-white room which together constitute a great place for photographing your peers. Would work especially well if everyone was wearing black turtlenecks. Anyway. - There is also an open elevator shaft which people can peer down into the abyss and have a tingly feeling in their special place. You know that place. - Plus a DJ who looms overhead like a lord of the hole in the wall, but then disappears when you blink again. Where did he go? Impressive feat, that. - Hearty pours / strong drinks, for all those who are interested in said qualities of a lounge-y establishment.  - A place to go out in this part of downtown that isn't blasting reggeton,  has 50 TVs tuned to the Suns game, or is full of hotel guests from Oklahoma who have no idea where else to go.   NEGATIVES - Go here strictly for drinks. The food isn't all that great. Given how much they've invested in everything else, it's kind of surprising their menu isn't up to snuff. Some flatbread pizzas, sandwiches, and a blase choice of appetizers. Waffle fries have not made the jump from AZ88 to here (not that I was expecting or wanting waffle fries - but something more than what was offered for food). They also need to  rethink their bruschetta - not the most user-friendly experience, especially eating it at the bar. - Something seems off about the seating upstairs. It could use a lot more couches and a lot less tables. But that's just me. - While several of the waitstaff/barstaff have been extremely friendly, professional and courteous, others still exuded the typical AZ88 holier-than-thou attitude. You know, the ones who grade you the moment you walk in to see if you're worth their while to wait on. What is it with wearing black t-shirts that does this to people? I don't think any place can afford to lose business over bad service these days, so they better figure out what to do with those bad apples .   So, all in all, 3.45 stars which unfortunately rounds down to 3. Even though this kind of establishment is not the type I see myself going to often, it's definitely a welcome addition to downtown and hopefully it'll succeed, given how much time, money, and energy went into it.   And for those curious about checking it out, let it be known this space was designed for people watching.  It's one of those scene-y joints, attracting people who enjoy being seen, for whatever that's worth. If you want more casual, I'd recommend heading back up to the Roosevelt/Lost Leaf part of town.",

I've often thought they may have bought these small martini glasses in the kids section of Ikea.  They must have been confused.  I think the space is pretty awesome and has a very clean, crisp feel to it.  I enjoyed the vegetarian pizza when I was there last and thought it was mighty tasty.  I'm not a big dough fan, so the flat bread is perfect for me.  At $11 a pop, I think it is a pretty decent value.  I'm generally a fan of pizza and paninis so Hanny's menu does not bother me (like many have noted).    If you can put up with a smaller than normal size martini, Hanny's is totally worth a shot.  However, beware non pizza and panini people!",

    "text": "Back to my days as the doorman at the Wyndham across the street, I used to watch construction of this restaurant. Such a great old building, and I was so happy they were finally doing something with it. I've watched progress in person and in pictures, as well as chatted about it with my friends, and three years later it is finally something.  The inside of the building is beautiful. Absolutely stunning. They did a great job with the old department store, and utilized a lot of space very efficiently. There are some neat touches here and there, one being the empty elevator shaft with a plexiglass cover, and some mirrors so you can seemingly see forever. It's not that deep! The restrooms upstairs (shame they are ALL upstairs) are awesome, in a white room surrounded with mirrors. I felt like I was in a padded asylum with mirrors, the asylum because I couldn't figure the place out. There is a DJ booth above the front door that is very easy to miss, and really a cool touch. The colors are all browns to keep with the nostalgic theme, and did I mention there are mirrors everywhere? The building and space get a 5. It's just cool.  We sat at the bar and were followed by a friendly little asian guy, with menus and he seemed genuinely interested in us having a good experience. He was previously across the street asking people to come over and try the restaurant. I wish I could say the bartender was half as friendly or committed to his job. The bald one was extremely unfriendly, seemed very arrogant, and for a person in a loud restaurant should practice his vocal skills. The service was prompt without mishaps throughout, but very cold.  I ordered the Carne Pizza. I have to say, it was one of the biggest disappointments I have had in a loooooong time. I have made better pizzas in my home oven that came from a box. Honestly... it had a paper thin cardboard like crust, no quality toppings, and not exactly a memorable taste. It tasted fine, and that was it's only redeeming quality. My neighbor had the roast beef sandwich and it was no better, or higher quality. The deli counter at Safeway can make a better sandwich. I earlier chastised someone for judging food on opening night, but now I see it really is bad, there is really no quality.  No sandwiches come with sides. No fries, no fruit, no salad, nothing. They are about $10, and if I want a great sandwich for $10 I'll go to Switch, and it will come with a great Caesar Salad on the side.  This is not a restaurant, but rather a bar that serves food. If I think of it like that... more like a bigger version of The Roosevelt, I can think a little more positive about this, but not much. Bad service, bad food, bad review. I'll not be coming back, even with the walking distance proximity. It's just not worth it, especially for the price, and to feel like a not busy staff doesn't want to be busy. We are now at the point where there are other options downtown that are better. It's no longer a Downtown where you can be mediocre and survive.",

The design, decor + ambiance will feel somewhat familiar, as will the quality of drinks at the bar (aside from much smaller martinis) - but the food at Hanny's is a strange departure from the top-notch bar food found at it's sister restaurant in Scottsdale.  While still bar food, Hanny's offers an odd assortment of pizzas, sandwiches and salads. And not a big assortment, either. Everything we tried tasted OK, but sounded better on the menu than it actually was. Portions were also disappointing for the price, especially the chopped salad, which was half the size of the chopped at AZ88 - and half as good - for about the same price.   The oven-fired pizzas had a nice thin, crispy crust, but toppings were just so-so and felt uninspired. Sandwich selections were more inspired, but only slightly appealing, from Charred Pork to the P.A.T., a fancy BLT made with pancetta and arugula. The Bar Plate was probably our favorite item, though still just OK - fresh prosciutto (sliced at the bar on a very cool Euro-style slicer), chunks of parmigiano-reggiano, slices of melon, and ciabatta bread - good, but nothing to write home about.  What is worth writing about is the place itself - a must-see, and just what downtown needed. Sleek, urban and the coolest industrial rehabbing around - from the clever open elevator shaft to the maze of bathroom stalls. And once the rooftop patio and basement lounge open, this place will surely be the hottest spot in town.  As for now, stop in, check it out, have a drink or two or three, and enjoy the beginning of a new era for downtown Phoenix. Just hope the menu improves with age...",

The ambiance of the place is solid for a date, an evening with friends, but maybe not a spot to go with family unless it's before 8pm on a weekday. Finally, the servers, collectively, are among the best in the downtown area. Busy or not, you'll be taken care of. After I defended my dissertation, I stopped in with friends to celebrate, and even though it was packed they managed to respond to a phone-call request from my out-of-state girlfriend who wanted to buy me a celebratory drink.

Down to business: If you think an enjoyable business lunch or pre-/post-event dinner consists of pimply-faced, snotty/pretentious/arrogant servers, overpriced, underflavored, miniature entrees, a crowd of see-and-be-seen poseurs who apparently couldn't find their way to Scottsdale, and Salon-de-City-Morgue ambience, this may be your place - let your inner DB run free.    This place is located nearby four downtown hotels, and obviously caters to the traveler/tourist visitors (who may be accustomed to the customer-service sensibilities of the coasts and) who probably won't be back - they CAN'T be relying on repeat business.  I was there ... it made a better men's store in its day.",

Yes it comes with a slice of cucumber but it seemed to be more than just a garnish.  Also had the huckleberry lemonade which was pretty bomb.  Really awesome place to sort of cruise around and see the sights.  Empty elevator shaft was trippy.  Downstairs really is pretty creepy.  If you've been there you know what that means....definitely not. A place to be alone late at night.",

My son and I were seated and we sat at our table for 10 minutes before being greeted by a server.  Strike One.  We placed our drink order and I also asked for water.  She said she could not bring out any water because the glasses were dirty.  Lame!  Strike Two.  She then immediately asked \"do you know what you want to eat\"?  Which seemed like an awkward version of \"are you ready to place your order\"?  I told her we needed more time but she took my son's menu and walked away!  STRIKE THREE and you know what that means!  BTW, my son is 17 yo so not like he's a screaming toddler.  We felt totally rushed and dissed and we walked out and will not be back.  Get it together Hanny's.  Your service sucks.",

This was my first time here, and my friend wanted to go because he said they have the best tiramisu and mojitos.  I have given up sweets for a while, but I decided to go anyways.  Hanny's used to be an old Men's Wearhouse department store.  It is a bit hidden, but you can find it by walk fairly easily.  We got inside and there were small groups and a lot of couples.  It has an upscale and chill feel to the place.  This would be a great place to take someone on a date.    My friend ordered the roast beef sandwich and tiramisu and I got a pizza with oregano, mozeralla cheese, and onions.  We enjoyed all our items.  My pizza has a light taste with extra sauce.  I really enjoyed it to end a fun night.",

I've never been so in love with an apple martini. I'm not even a pizza junkie but I found myself addicted to theirs.   The place itself is also tons of fun... they have a DJ and the crowd is live! It reminds me of a lounge in New York or Los Angeles.  However, the service is just awful. The bartenders are rude and the waiters aren't pleasant either. Granted, it is unbelievably packed and I'm sure they're up to their neck in orders... but that doesn't excuse impolite behavior.   I would definitely recommend everyone to give this place a chance; if you happen to have friendly service that night, you'll fall in love with Hanny's.",

It's a very open and eclectic design with some very unusual sculptures and basement \"dolls\". The old elevator shaft with the glass floor is also very cool.  What frustrates me about this establishment is the service. It's spotty at best with a 50% chance that when you walk in, you will not be greeted and seated in a reasonable amount of time. The wait staff is average and you just never feel like you're too welcome here - and that includes the rather snotty bartenders. I would classify it as a rather \"cold\" experience.  I'm sorry Hanny's, I have spent a lot of my hard earned $$ here but no more.",

I had the pomegranate julep and the $5 gin martini, both great.  If you're by yourself, you will feel comfortable here. This is so not a meat market. It's not a cafe, but it's also not a skeezy bar.  I did dock one star for the guy who \"greeted\" me when I walked in. I was by myself, not looking terribly put together, with a backpack and casual clothes. He didn't seem too hyped to seat me and that left a bad taste in my mouth, until the very sweet server (Jeanett, I think) took over. Then it was all good from there. Hanny's, why are you not in the Bay Area?",

My girl and I left an event next door at the Wyndham or Renaissance I think it's now called and since it was around 11PM on a Sunday we wanted to find a decent place nearby that still served food. So Hanny's was close and had people inside that were eating so we walked on in. I love that this place was at one time a department store it gives it a modern and unique flair. My friend and I were seated right away and since I had been drinking wine earlier in the night all I wanted was water and some delicious food!   I was just going to settle on the onion straws but our server insisted on the roast beef sandwich, he said it's what he was having later. So on the menu the sandwich sounds pretty tasty, roast beef, bacon, arugula, and even a fried egg! So when it came out it looked yummy, it even came with a side of the onion straws that I was going to order so I decided to put them on the sammy to add some flavor. I took a bite and...I was kinda bummed...I expected all of these flavors to explode in my mouth but that didn't happen..it was just ok the roast beef was pretty bland but the bacon and onion straws seemed to help it out a bit. My friend had one of their pizza's and she said it was just ok as well.  The service was decent and the place has pretty good drinks so I may stop in again to give something off of their menu another try.",

The Gorgonzola slaw side item was good and unusual.  I would have really liked it, if only it weren't so salty.  :-(  What we noticed was the everything we ordered came with pistachios.

Food was excellent.  We ordered three pizzas: carne, prosciutto, and blanco.  I love meat, and assumed that the carne pizza would be my favorite.  It was great, but the prosciutto was better.  This pizza is every bit as good as Bianco's, if not better, and you can get in without being made to feel like the object of condescension.  Finally, they have a five dollar martini that was excellent.  (Don't forget to have the donuts for dessert.  They are good - but I think in the past they were better.)  My wife had the beet salad which was a little light on beets and heavy on arugula.  Otherwise, outstanding food, even the \"onion strings\" that we had as an appetizer.

HOWEVER, I've never had such terrible service, not just from an individual server but from everyone working there my first (and last) night in. Our server looked at us with a blank stare and lacked social skills, which wasn't the worst part and can be totally excusable. What shocked me was that we went from one rude bartender to another. The blonde bartender spoke in an insulting tone and was not happy when we ordered waters, after previously ordering drinks and attempting to order more. After her rudeness she passed us along to a different bartender who was equally as bland. Hanny's has the appeal of a really cool, urban spot, but don't let the appeal fool you. You'll get terrible service and pretty much pass out trying to use the restroom because it is beyond disgusting. Hanny's invest in better employees and adapt to this century's sense of hygiene.",

No such tables were ready. No host greeted us, and when I explained the situation to the waiter who was also hurriedly running around, he responded: \"Guess what? Tonight we're short-staffed, too.\"  Guess what? Maybe you should hire more people.   The abruptness continued. We were yelled at to get our IDs ready in advance if we wanted to drink, and when my friend didn't have hers out because she came late, the waiter was visibly annoyed. They didn't bring out my other friend's order with the rest of the dinners (to be fair, they comped her meal after she brought this to their attention). I never got a refill on my water or was asked if I wanted a second drink (also to be fair, their $5 martini is pretty decent). The pizza was greasy and unremarkable, and their fried onion strings were really fried batter strings, leaving the onion to the imagination.   Perhaps I happened to come on the worst, short-staffed nights. But I wouldn't risk making that mistake again.",

Relatively inexpensive with uber-cool decor, Hanny's is a great place to get the night started.  We started with interesting cocktails that have really cool sounding ingredients and loved all of them!  Some classics and new takes on old favorites.  Absinthe for the daring...It should be noted that there is a heavy dose of fried egg on the menu.  Knowing that fried eggs are good for defeating and preventing hangovers, I decided on the roast beef sandwich - 4/5 stars. The coleslaw with pistachios was MONEY, super good; everyone was stealing mine.  And our friend who was splurging got the bacon wrapped prawns: killer combo, chow down on these and thank me later. Probably the highlight for me.  Mysterious restroom setup and the elevator shaft? Super fun conversation pieces. Reclining sofas at the dinner table? Don't-mind-if-I-do! (Careful, this bedeviling machine caused wine to be spilled on my jeans!)  Give it a shot before dancing in downtown Phoenix and you'll have a delicious time and feel very hip while doing so.",

Hanny's uncorks a stylized, evocative urban design in a old building with great bones, refreshing the increasingly lively downtown. The food matches the style. It's location is a great spot to start your evening or to finish the night. It has a coolish vibe with chill decor. Appetizers like Asperges & Egg or Shrimp Prosciutto will get the evening started right. Cocktails  like a classic Martini or the Ginger Creek surely a great way to set the tone for a fun night. The missing star is for the somewhat diminishing customer service, it can be a roll of the dice depending on the night.",

I had the grilled cheese with tomato sauce, slaw and shoestring onions. It was honestly some of the best food I have had in awhile. The grilled cheese was flavorful; the tomato sauce complimented nicely. The slaw was incredible. I wanted a whole bowl of it. The shoestring onions were good but I thought they would be better if it was paired with a dipping sauce. Regardless, still pretty good. My boyfriend got the spicy honey pepperoni pizza. It was also delicious. Best for someone who enjoys spicy food. ;) I loved the relaxing vibe mixed with the wild artwork. Hanny's is a fun and affordable restaurant style experience with a great History. When you visit, be sure to visit upstairs and the basement. It's a must. I will return soon.",

Aaliyah was our bartender/server she was awesome! She was very knowledgeable about the food and the liquor. I love this place! The music, the lighting and the artistic ambiance. One night I came in and they were playing Curtis Mayfield and Betty Davis. I had never heard Betty Davis' (not the actress, the rocker aka Miles Davis' ex-wife) music being played anywhere but in my car or back in Atlanta when local bands would cover her. That is when I knew this place was dope. The first time I went I was afraid to go down to the basement and look at the dolls. The post cards show the dolls looking kind of spooky. But when I went down it wasn't that bad. They bring you your check attached to a post card. You can address it and write a little message to someone, they will send it out when they collect enough. What a cool concept. I have done it twice so far, totally going to do it every time! This place never disappoints.",

Let me tell you I moved to Phoenix one year ago and she is the MEANEST person I met in Phoenix. My first experience with the unpleasant Miss Jennifer was last Tuesday and I hope to never see her again in Hanny's or a dark alley because she is very intimidating and scary.....and im not the only person with this feeling because as I sat by the bar among other customers I could hear them complaining about Miss Jennifer's poor customer service. I think it's far for me to say I speak for a lot of customers at this point .... Hanny's we love you but please put Miss Jennifer ithe Dish Pit away from us happy customers until she cools off and if she doesn't cool off throw her out with the trash and let her take that sour attitude to a hole in the wall kind of establishment because she definitely brings down Hanny's",

There were two ladies seated in the same section who didn't even get a \"hi\" until well after we got our food.  The couple at the table next to them asked their waitress to serve them, but she literally said \"not my table\" and left.  As I was walking out, I flagged down a bartender and told him to send the manager over and comp the ladies food because of what they had been through, and he said \"I'll see if I can find someone, but I doubt they'll comp them\".  On my way out the door, I heard a guy telling people waiting for a table that it's \"not worth the wait; service sucks!\" (and they followed him out).  Sad to watch the downfall of great restaurants.",

Downtown is usually pretty dead when there aren't any ball games going on, so there isn't much of a ruckus normally.  From what I've been told, Hanny's used to be a department store.  The wait staff wears these white lab coat looking things but I'm sure it ties in with the theme somehow.  The food and drinks are surprisingly good.  The pizza is great.  This time, we ordered the prosciutto pizza and the margherita pizza.  I had one friend with me that was amazed by the proscuitto pizza and he said it was life changing.  The cocktails must have been great, since a lot of folks that normally wouldn't be drinking cocktails were indulging in them.   The bathrooms on the 2nd floor are set up in a very non conventional way.  There's different symbols on the doors so you can see which one you can use accordingly.   The bottom floor right by the entrance has a very interesting set up with some dolls that's I'll need to find out more about next time.",

Our waitress took our drink order, I ordered the Heckish old fashioned. she asked me a follow up question about my choice of drink to ensure that I would like it (she said most people expect a fruitier/sweeter drink but she told me it tastes more like bourbon) I stuck with my decision since I like bourbon and I'm so glad that I did. It was delicious. We order bruschetta as an appetizer, the prosciutto pizza, and the carne pizza since we husband and I could agree on a pizza. We had plenty of leftovers to take home.

Our waiter got into a fist fight with a drunk patron, and the fight ended up at our table. All of our meals and drinks ended up on the floor and our table was practically flipped over. Instead of being concerned about their customers, the wait staff was more focused on cleaning up the broken plates before the police arrived while we stood around without a table to sit at. A female waitress then took her frustration out on us and said it's not her fault that this situation happened. Of course we understand that it is personally not her doing, but first off she called my stepfather an asshole and secondly, when a dangerous and upsetting situation happens at your establishment and then you don't do anything to make up for it or at least be somewhat attentive to your customers, it is absolutely the staffs concern and they are liable for making up for the damage done. Obviously they don't have much experience in giving good customer service, so if that is what you are looking for then definitely don't come here.",

The waitress was just dreadful however and please please please get rid of those friggin chairs that fall back when you sit on them. That alone made me never want to return. The place is pretty cool to walk around and explore however.  I give it 3 stars for the food but 2 for service.",

The decor and construction of the place and the furniture makes the place unique. I went to the bathroom and was very confused at first because the doors blended into the wall. And there were some awesome mirrors on the second floor with great lighting. I took pictures of myself. Haha.  But yeah, 4 minute walk from the light rail and pretty cool posh place to hang out on a Friday night. I say worth it!",

Also you can check weird puppet thing downstairs. - Live DJ spinning and for the most part I enjoy the music (more of a lounge music) - Good food. - Good number of crowds especially over the weekend.  I had seen different type of people here/ mixed crowd which is great in my opinion. - Can be considered a romantic place for date. Especially if you get to sit upstairs. Just feel more private.  Cons: - Can be pricey",

    "text": "Complete disappointment and a let down!!! I could end it there but I wont. My wife and I came here on Friday night to celebrate with a friend that Just graduated. My first reaction to this place was \"wow\"!!! It was Incredibly nice, and classy. We found our friends and got to our seats, we hung out for a good 15 min before I started getting antsy since our waitress hadn't come by to get us drinks. Our friends said the waitress had been great all night and give her a few more min, which I hesitantly did. Another 5 min went by and I had enough, I went to the bar to get a drink and as I was walking up to it, my wife called me to come back because the waitress had showed up. I very calmly returned to my seat and ordered overpriced celebratory Don Julio shots and a overpriced Dos Equis and a pepperoni pizza. Awhile went by maybe 10 min and the waitress came back with our shots and a kilt lifter??? She apologized and said she would be right back, at this time I told her to just bring 2 Beers so that I wouldn't have to wait for my second one... At this point I had gone well over 30 min without a beer and I was at my breaking point. The only reason I was still there was because our friends liked this place. I stepped outside to take a call and one of our friends saw I was agitated and just went to the bar and got me a beer... After I finished that one I returned to the bar myself to get another beer... in the meantime the waitress had stopped by to drop off my friends drinks but still had nothing for me. About after a hour and 15 min I found my waitress and told her to cancel my pizza and to just get me our tables tab... I was done with this... She apologized and brought my tab, along with my pizza wrapped in aluminum foil.... I told her I was over the pizza, and that I didn't want it. I wanted to have dinner while relaxing, not take it home (which we were not going that way). She said it was ok, she wrapped it so I could take it with???? WTF?! As I was looking at the tab, she charged me for the Pizza I told her I Didn't want anymore, the 2 beers I never got, shots, and 2 drinks for our friends... At this point I Said  F* it and started eating the Pizza, if I was gonna pay for it I may as well eat it hot. When she came back I told her that I never got the beers and why were they on my tab? She walked off to get it taken care of and mid stride turned around and came back, She asked if she could just give us cash for the beers... I was confused... This waitress was willing to just give us cash from her tips to correct her error, then to ask the manager to remove the 2 beers that were never delivered.. I told her not to worry about it, since at the end of the day I would rather just cut my losses and leave this place. It sucks I had this experience. Everyone around me had food, drinks and were having a great time...I wish I could have enjoyed this place.   At the end of the night: 1 pepperoni pizza 2 Don Julio Shots  2 Dos Equis (I never got) friends 2 mixed drinks Equaled a 75 dollar tab= Like I said overpriced...   (This doesn't include the 2 beers I paid cash for at the bar)",

    "text": "Can't I just show you some pictures of Hanny's, give it six stars, and call it a day?   No? I have to be more descriptive in reviews? Fine.  This place rocks. Shut up and sit down at the bar. Order anything. You'll learn pretty fast. You can't go wrong with the Caiprinaha. I can't pronounce (or spell) it either, but they'll be more than happy to give you an intro to this high-octane Brazilian cocktail. Yes, it's $10 but you don't even know what cachaca is so pipe down and enjoy it. If you're a wuss like me, just stir it up with your nifty stick of rock candy until you can handle it. All cocktails are pricey, but most of them use high-end ingredients. All made by knowledgeable bartenders.  If you want dinner, just go with something that has prosciutto on it. I had it on my pizza and lemme tell you--you can't go wrong with this. If you dine at the right time, you can expect a DJ on the second floor.  But whatever you do, use the restrooms. USE THE RESTROOMS. Tell me you're not amused. I'll try not to ruin the surprise.  Overall, I've only been here a handful of times, but I don't think I could ever get tired of it. Here are some tiny nit-picky criticisms I have:  -It was totally cooler when the bathrooms didn't have labels on them. I think there were more mirrors (oops! spoiler alert!) too. I totally understand why it would need the slight adjustment, and it's still great for conversation.  -Several cocktails stood out because they used Bacardi Rum. At the risk of sounding like a snob, that discouraged me from trying the rum-based beverages.  -Your staff looks a tad worn out and a bit short. When I get carded twice to order a drink, I can tell that a lack of communication may spill into other tasks around the establishment.   -WHEN IS THE BAR ON THE SECOND FLOOR OPEN!? IT'S AMAZING.  I'll shut my trap. Just go here, you won't regret it.",

At all hours of the day.  I'm updating my review to applaud Danielle our server from the other night. A bunch of friends and I were on the prowl for a place to hang out. (Hanny's is right around the corner from CityScape, where we had caught a great StandUp Live comedy show.)   Seated immediately Danielle was quick to take our orders and return with drinks. Her witty and cheery banter was quite the surprise. Why? She's preggers! When you stop in to visit you too can be greeted by smiles.   Hanny's is a place that loves you no matter what. In the mood to eat? Flat breads and snacky food is divine. Worried about parking? They have a lot. Planning to indulge in a deluge of five dollar martinis? They're right off the light rail!  The ambiance is very chill here. Dress up or not, you'll fit right in.The bar is a wonderful place to people watch. Groups are welcome and there is plenty of seating.   Be sure to reserve time to tour the restaurant. The elevator shaft, bathrooms and basement are Instagram heaven. (No, you won't be murdered. Just go!)  Anyhoo, thank you Hanny's for the good times!",

We were seated right away and waiting staff was very attending. Saw a number of people on dates so guessing it is a good a date spot for the locals :).   Drinks were normal even though they didn't have my first selection of white wine from the menu.   For vegetarian, plenty of options. Cauliflower Calabrese was spicy and flavorful. The pizza and beet salad lacked the punch and nothing out of the ordinary. Would have liked the food to be as good the ambiance and drinks.",

The ambiance and decor is a bit cooky mixed with modern sleek.  Our server gal was impressive - she was engaging, genuinely friendly, knowledgeable about the beers and quick with service.  We ordered the Bar Plate with lost of different things on there that was enough for all of us.. there were three different pizzas on the table that we ordered and they were all delicious in their own right (yes, I tried 'em all!).  I really liked that the crust was thin and still chewy and crispy at the same time.  The beet salad also looked delicious from across the table.  What stood out for me was, of course, their passion for cocktails.  I loved that I wanted to try every drink on their menu... well, we practically did.  At our table was Chimay, Huckleberry Lemonade, Classic Manhattan, ... and, of course a couple different types of Absinthe (Mata Hari and Grant Absente) and my Yellow 80 proof Chartreuse.  Great cocktails, is all I can say!  Great ambiance, cool decor, friendly and quick staff, tasty pizzas and a covetable bar menu and you got me at hello.",

I love AZ88 and when I found out they were bringing a restaurant downtown, I couldn't wait to make it my new favorite lunch spot.  I walked in and was not disappointed - beautiful interior, definitely a more trendy vibe than the other places we have downtown. Then Iooked at the menu.  Pizza, sandwiches, and onion rings.  That about covers it.  Not a very diverse menu, nothing overly exciting.  Food is decent but nothing spectacular (no AZ88 chicken sandwich standout). I went back after work and its an okay place for happy hour.  Drinks are on the pricey side but Hanny's at least feels like the type of restaurant you'd want to hit up for happy hour in a big city downtown. Overall, nothing drawing me back for food and maybe a happy hour every now and then.  I was hoping for more and was disappointed.",

The ambiance is different than anything else I've seen in Phoenix. It actually reminds me of a place we used to go in Chicago. Very cool, very laid back, yet still upscale. Definitiely worth checking out for a change from the same old Scottsdale lounge scene.",

I was debating on ordering one of their martini's but when I saw the size of the glasses, relative to the price of the drinks, I thought better of it. My friends and I ordered their Pizza Bianco, which was good, but not great. It was a mix of chesses, diced tomato, and basil leaves on a very flat crunch bread. It was not savory all. Hard to explain. Like the flavors were all there, but somehow didn't come together. And when you reached the \"crust\" of the pizza, it tasted like burnt popcorn. Ick! The bartenders were cool for the most part but a little stand offish at first. And like some of the other Yelpers have mentioned before, the bathrooms were probably the coolest part of the place. My friends and I were sure we'd see Bowie standing there in the bathroom hall of mirrors telling us how much time we had to get through the Labrynth.",

    "text": "HUGE space on 1st St., with nice decor, although a little too drab for my tastes. And the music is offbeat...a little classical, a little New Age, a little jazz. The bathrooms are super weird, as you'd expect from the people behind AZ88. The service is very friendly, if not always the most prompt. The food is...well, it's nothing memorable. Their \"bruschetta\" is really more like an olive tapenade, with crostini on the side. When I asked a friend how he liked Hanny's, he said, \"It's good, but a little oily.\" I thought, \"what?!\" but I understood what he meant when I saw and tasted the crostini. And then came the prosciutto pizza. While I loved the thin crust, the nice sauce, the prosciutto, arugala, and fresh shaved parmigiano-reggiano, the cheese was also super oily. Bring the Tums, people. Dessert was the biggest flop of all. The lemon meringue tart had almost no lemon at all. It was basically warm, runny meringue (which the waitress said had just been freshly made...obviously not well) on a crust. It was like it was missing a whole layer of lemon filling. Hanny's will be a cool place to hang out and grab a drink after Suns or D-backs games, but it's not a place to go to for the food.",

    "text": "I've seen a few reviews knocking on the service, but it couldn't be further from the truth as far as I'm concerned.  Elena was our server, and she was sweet, friendly, and very accommodating.  The food was outstanding.  I took my mother here for dinner before a show at the Orpheum last night, and we decided to nosh on a bunch of appetizers rather than loading up on heavy entrees.  The standout dishes were the prosciutto shrimp (or were they LOBSTERS... they were so big) and the cauliflower calabrese.  We also had the snack plate and the bruschette, which were both great dishes in their own right.  The food arrived quickly, and everyone with whom we had contact was professional, courteous, and accommodating.  All that being said, you cannot visit this place without taking the \"tour\":  the original elevator shaft with the clear floor and ceiling; walk around upstairs to get a view of the scene down below, and don't forget to check out the restrooms; then take a look at the funky mannequin in the front window of the restaurant (with the doll faces on her butt); last, but not least, is the creepy doll collection in the basement.  All these things add a great deal of character and personality.  This goes on my list of places to take out-of-towners.  Well done, Hanny's!  P.S. - A special shout-out to Elena, who didn't sing happy birthday to my mother (sparing us, she says), but brought out Tiramisu with a candle.  We told her of our plans for the rest of the night, and wouldn't you know she spotted us walking back to our cars in the garage next door.  She snuck out the door to greet us and ask us about the show, and we chatted up for another few minutes.",

Nothing actually, but while I was enjoying a Pimm's cup the Bad Cactus Brass Band spontaneously paraded itself around the dining room to the tune of  When the Saints Go Marching In.    Hanny's was pretty empty for what is normally considered rush hour on a Friday night.  It also gave me the feeling of being in a train station, not sure why exactly.  Maybe it's the color scheme, it's sort of monochromatic with black, grey and a pop of white.  It also feels cold and usually I'm cold when in train stations.  I don't know, that is just the vibe I get.  Don't get me wrong, I liked it.   The service was great, but I think I will only be back for drinks and maybe an appetizer.  The food is really nothing special and I think I'd rather go to AZ88.  The only menu items I've tried are from the sandwich section, so it could be that I need to give Hanny's another shot.  I would like to try the pizza, but didn't on this visit because I swear I'd had pizza three times that week.  I was starting to feel like a college student again.  The delivery guy even said something like, \"You sure do like pizza.  I've been here a lot lately.\"  Hey, don't judge me.",

    "text": "I haven't removed my original 5-star review of Hanny's, replacing it with this 1-star, because I nabbed the first-to-review for it and don't feel like giving that up. But let me be absolutely clear: going to Hanny's is most definitely a 1-star experience, for reasons I will describe below. When I write a one-star review on Yelp, it means the following: I will not come here again unless I really have to (e.g., some pre-planned organizational event beyond my control). I will refuse to recommend anyone that I know to come here. I will refuse to suggest this as a venue for any event for any of the organizations I belong to. And I will tell everyone that I know, whenever it comes up, that Hanny's is a horrible place to spend any part of your evening.   Seated at a large table with about 10 or 15 people one recent night, a friend and I ordered a beer each. Everyone else ordered various drinks and some snacks, and a pizza or two, as well. After 5 or 10 minutes, everyone else had gotten our drinks but the two of us. Though this is a bit annoying, it's nothing to write home about and not a big deal. Another 5 minutes later, the pizzas came out, which we weren't eating.   But, still no beers.   Another 5 minutes later (about 20 minutes after we'd ordered them), a third friend of ours who had noticed our beer-less selves got irritated on our behalf and decided to complain to our waiter. Yes, she did so in a somewhat stern manner. But she was not rude, and she did not speak with a raised voice. She was just to-the-point, and spoke in a manner that was commensurate with the unacceptably slow service we were being provided.  A waiter who receives a complaint like this has a choice in how to respond. I dare say that the professional response, especially when (as is the case here) the customer actually IS right and the service actually HAS been unacceptably slow, is to say, \"Ma'am, you're right, and I am so sorry. We've just been backed up and I will bring them out pronto.\" That would be the end of the story, right?  Alternatively, you could stare back at the customer with a hostile look, and then defiantly declare with a rude and aggressive tone of voice, \"Yeah, I'll get them, but as you can see we had a lot of food to bring out.\" Which is what happened. So, Excuse me? Our friend looked back and returned the favor, \"I don't really care what your logistical problems are. I'm just pointing out that they don't have their drinks and they've been waiting for 20 minutes.\" The response: \"Yeah, I heard you the first time.\" He then sulked off.   That wasn't the end of it. Playing some sort of passive-aggressive game with the two of us, this waiter deliberately made us sit for an additional 5 or 10 minutes before finally bringing out our beers. He then refused to come back to our table again, even when new people joined our party and wanted to order a drink. (We wound up advising them to go directly to the bar to order, since we were being actively boycotted.) When he finally did bring us our drinks, I waited to see if an apology would accompany (keep in mind that the two of us had actually remained silent while all this was going on, since our other friend had decided to take on the service problem.) I was completely stunned to hear a wall of silence. I had done or said nothing to this man at all, other than politely order a glass of beer from him 25 minutes earlier. He could not muster up a simple, \"Sorry about that, guys.\"   Did I mention that this wasn't a busy night, so we were one of only a few groups they had to service at the time?   As our table talked about what just happened, I learned that others have experienced this behavior from the staff in the past. And it actually has been to this level of deep and open hostility by waiters (I assume the same one). This doesn't shock me. There is no way a waiter or manager would become so emboldened to behave this way in front of customers he doesn't even know, unless it's part of a pattern. This wasn't just \"having a bad night,\" which I let go all the time when I occasionally encounter it in restaurants. It was something deeper than that.   Not only does the rudeness appall me, but so does the sheer incompetence of not realizing how widespread word-of-mouth can be when you attack a group of customers like us. How does this waiter know who we are? Maybe some of us are long-time residents of downtown Phoenix, who have lived there for years and know a lot of people? Maybe our voices, here on Yelp and among our very large social circles, are highly influential and can have a direct impact on a restaurant's revenues? Did he consider that before deciding to attack us? Nope.  Karl Kopp, the owner of Hanny's, needs to have a serious talk with whoever is managing this restaurant. In the meantime, my opinion that I will loudly and frequently proclaim to everyone I know will remain unchanged, unless and until I receive a personal apology for this incident. I'm not holding my breath.",

If you like a diverse crowd or people who have to park their cars behind the building or in a deck so there is no chance to be pretentious, this is your place.  Pizzas... amazing.  And, I wish I could buy that building, that place is one of the coolest restaurant in Arizona.",

The atmosphere, drinks, food, food and food... There is always a DJ playing above the crowd and the music is always good.   My favorite eats...  #1 Prosciutto di Parma Pizza  #2 Side Salad  #3 Doughnuts and Chocolate Sauce   Other favorites... chocolate cake, any other pizza, snack plate... Anything really...   My favorite drinks...    I typically go with a Grey Goose on the rocks with 3 lemon wedges.. Which is a generous pour for $10 at Hanny's, but their signature cocktails are yummy too.. I like Peach Porch Tea, Huckleberry Lemonade or any martini. If I'm not drinking hard liquor, I will order a carafe of Pinot Grigio only $15 when one glass is $9.   The seats recline on the booths, if it's busy enough you can get a seat upstairs and it's always fun to sit in the window seats.   I have never had a service issue and the staff is friendly and willing to make good small talk. Hanny's is a great place to hang out any night of the week...",

Heard good things in yelp so myself and a group of 10 came and had worst service. The waitress had an attitude, and took 15 minutes to ask us for drinks. She hadn't stopped in a while, and I wanted to pay my tab. I walked to a waitress and asked her if it was possible to close with her, she sarcastically with attitude asked if she was my server. Obviously not, and I told her that was a stupid question. No wonder it's prime night time and it's empty.",

    "text": "This is a very interesting place.  An old department store turned restaurant and bar with a cool 1940's vibe.  I wasn't around in the 40's so I'm not sure how accurately this place portrays the period but it was a hip, unique and interesting place nonetheless.  There was a very cool vibe going on and I felt like a hip urbanite even knowing about the place.     My party of 5 arrived at about 7pm on a Saturday and the place was pretty dead.  We were seated promptly by a friendly hostess.  We were told that the place gets pretty busy later in the evening as it turns into more of a cocktail lounge.  They have some pretty interesting cocktails which all seem to be 1940's inspired.  I had a classic martini which was very good and reasonably priced.  My table split 3 appetizers/salads before our meals:  * Cauliflower Calabrese - this was very unique and pretty random if you ask me.  I wasn't really a huge fan of this but the rest of my party was. * Chopped Salad - this was very tasty with lots of good ingredients, but I hate it when everything is separated.  I like my salad to be pre-mixed. * Beet Salad - this was my first beet salad so I'm not sure if it was traditional or not.  Anyway, it was excellent.  I wasn't sure if I would like beets or not because I never have them but I was a big fan of this salad.  I especially liked the goat cheese.  For our meals we split the Prosciutto de Parma (minus the prosciutto) and the Quattro.  While they were both pretty good, they weren't too memorable.  They were a good size and perfect for 3+ people to share.  I'm still not quite sure what to think of this place.  The ambiance was interesting but didn't really mesh with the food they were serving.  Is this place Italian, 1940's hipster, etc.? I just don't get it.  All-in-all the place was good and a good experience but there are several other bars and pizza places I'd like to check out before I return.",

    "text": "I was looking through my reviews and can't believe I haven't posted a review of Hanny's.  I love Hanny's!  It's an awesome place to go to on a weekend evening.  It's right off the lightrail.  Drinks and food are very affordable and it has an awesome sleek uptown feel without the attitude.  Now I would like to take this opportunity to tell you about the first time my boyfriend and I went to this establishment.    We went to a Phoenix Suns game and afterwards we were looking for a place to hang out and chill.  We walked around  Downtown Phoenix for a good 20 minutes.  We weren't interested in the sports bars around the Purple Palace.  We came across Hanny's.  After we saw that they had appletinis for only $5, I was sold.  We walked in and thought that it was a really sleek place.  We also couldn't believe that the prices were so reasonable.  We loved the fact that the seats reclined and they had a DJ spinning.  It was almost too good to be True.  When my boyfriend and I were seated, I went up the bathroom.  It reminded me of a bath house.  I rushed back down with a look of panic on my face.  I thought it was a a restaurant that catered to \"Swingers.\" We scanned the room and it was mostly couples.  We were almost convinced of it.  We started send out a barrage of text messages to find out the real truth about this place.  Only 2 people knew about Hanny's.  Luckily, they reassured us that it wasn't a hangout for swinging couples. LOL!!  Anyway, Hanny's is one of our favs in Phoenix and we are happy to have stumble upon it.  I love the fact that the owners saw such potential in making an old department store into a hip hot spot.  If you are looking for something to do on a Friday or Saturday night, I highly recommend taking a group of friends or a date and having a drink at Hanny's.",

    "text": "One of our go to drink spots before any event in downtown Phoenix.  The flat bread pizzas are all pretty good and big enough for 2-3 to share; I've tried quite a few and generally prefer the carne or prosciutto.  We aren't really there for the food though, as Hanny's offers a great selection of old school cocktails to choose from.  You'll see classics like Aviation and The Last Word on the menu - drinks that show up in mixology books, particularly those that dive into cocktail history, but usually result in a quizzical look at most other joints.  To be perfectly honest, I feel that these choices are mostly of novelty value - there are much better choices on the menu, and now that I've sampled most everything I tend to stick with tried and True standards like Manhattans, Old Fashioned and such.  A couple others to try:  Hanny's has a pretty interesting take on the caipirinha, allowing you to sweeten your own drink by stirring in some pink rock candy.  And last night I asked for a Sazerac (not on the menu) - bartender didn't follow the traditional recipe, but it came out quite good nonetheless.  The only drink so far that I would not recommend is the Mint Julep; the silver cup presentation is nice, but the bourbon wasn't properly balanced and taste was too harsh...probably because the default base is Jim Beam (I'm not a fan).",

And....my boyfriend ordered the roast beef sandwich. It came with an egg in it, but the egg was fried all the way through. So he asked for mayo. This did not help the sandwich as the meat was dry, and the egg still had no yolk to moisten it. The server asked if we wanted a box for the entire half he didn't eat, but we told her no because it was dry. She said she could offer us some donuts because of the sandwich, but we do like sweets so we declined. We were charged full price for the sandwich, half of which he did not eat because it was inedible. This is not right. We both have worked in the restaurant industry for over 14 years, and I've never seen such lack of concern for customer satisfaction, or attention to detail when it comes to expoing your food. The inside decor is interesting and clean, but we will not be back simply because of poor good quality, and lack of customer consideration.",

The food and service were equally incredible.  The bar plate is excellent and the house salad was the best we have ever had.  Try the onion strings!  The Mrs. LOVES the Peach Porch Tea.  During the day the music was great in setting an enjoyable atmosphere...jazzy and classical stuff.  The DJ was playing some funky cool stuff the night we stopped in for drinks and a snack.

We sat at the bar and got a drink and ordered food.  Good news: the roast beef and bacon sandwich was the best thing I have ever had. Legit. Say it again...legit.  Bad news: the prosciutto incident. They have this prosciutto ham or whatever behind the bar on a pedastool. Totally showcased. Piqued our interest. Asked the bartender for a sample and he declined. We have him he business over it but to know avail. He then sent over the manager. Manager held the ground and wouldn't give us a sample. After some banter we conceded and went back to eating our sandwich.  Bottom line....great roast beef sandwich. Bartender and manager are a bunch of jerk offs for not giving us any prosciutto. That's right...jerk offs!",

Who doesn't love a cool restroom?! It was decorated beautifully with modern touches. They have a ton of tasty cocktails to choose from. I got some type of mojito or something which was out of this world. Then let's pause and take a minute to get prepared to read about their amazing flatbread pizzas! I ordered the Bianco (it was a tad spicy but other than that it was perfect). This flat bread was huge and definitely shareable. I had friends that got the Prosciutto Pizza and it was absolutely divine. I plan on getting that the next time I go back. Hanny's is a must if you live in or visiting Phoenix!

We ordered a few pizzas and I thought they were delicious. They went fast however and they weren't too filling.  I wasn't crazy about some of the patrons. I got quite a few dirty looks on my way to the bathroom from hipster, androgynous females. Maybe it was the veil still attached to my head.

The powers of Yelp brought me to Hanny's, so that's where we went.   Conveniently located off of the light rail, we walked in and were seated immediately. The place is pretty swanky, so make sure you're dressed appropriately. We got a round table near the back and took a look at the menu. For a place that looks so awesome, the menu isn't as hard on the wallet as one might think. Most of us started off with cocktails, I had the Huckleberry lemonade ($9, and I actually had 2) which was delish. My other friends had the peach porch tea, the pomegranate julep (SO STRONG), and a Riesling. We were all starving when we got there so we got the bruschetta appertizers which is straight up bruschetta, there was no messing around with that.    Time to order: I had the carne pizza, and everyone else had the carne with red peppers, the prosciutto de parma (sp?), the standard blt, and the roast beef sandwich. Now, when I go to a swanky looking place and pay $9 for my drink, I assume that my $13 pizza isn't going to be anything to write home about, but first of all it was massive. The leftovers were enough for at least one meal. And even the salads and sandwiches that were going by our table were pretty big. The pizza was really good, not like anything I've had before, but really yummy. We swapped samples of everyone's stuff and everything was really good.  Our server was a tad slow, which we probably only noticed because we were in a crunch at the end to pay and make it to the theater in time, but he was really nice and split our checks at the end of the meal.",

It is spacious inside with various types of seating - you can be at a table, a booth, by the bar or at one of the multiple social areas scattered throughout the floor.  The place looks a bit like a converted theater with a DJ on the 2nd level where you can see him through an opening in the wall.  There is some cool art around the restaurant too. There is also an old shaft-looking corner with a glass floor that looks quite cool.  I loved the modern yet low-key relaxed vibe that attracts a diverse crowd.  The food and drinks did not disappoint.  I only had a veggie pizza with a glass of wine but both were delicious.  I definitely would like to come back to enjoy more Hanny's.  The only thing that is a pain for anything downtown is the parking, but otherwise it is a lovely lovely place!",

    "text": "Wow. Not a good place to go for a drink after work. I went for a work \"Happy Hour\" to Hanny's last weekend, and could not have been more put off  by the rude staff. I arrived and the group I was joining already had drinks, so I went to the bar to grab a drink.   I asked the bartender what their Happy Hour specials were and he looked at me as if I were an idiot and disdainfully said, \"We don't have a Happy Hour (subtext: how terribly gauche of you to even ask), but here is our drink menu,\" and then shoved an overpriced wine list at me.  I was taken aback, but ordered a glass of pinot grigio, and then told him we were on the same ticket as the group right next to the bar. He said to me, \"Well do you have a server?\" and I replied, \"I don't know, I just got here; can you please transfer this drink to that tab?\" and he could not have been more rude or disgruntled about it. I'll add that there were a whopping two other people besides my group at the bar, so it's not like he was overwhelmed with other customers. With service like that, it's no wonder.  There are much better Happy Hour places you can check out after work - Fez, Switch, Cheuvront all come to mind - so skip the grouchy bartender 'tude and look elsewhere.",

    "text": "WTF? I thought for sure I had reviewed this place. Whoops. Ok, I really love Hanny's. Like for real, it's almost creepy. You instantly feel cool as fuck upon walking into this bar. A huge part of that is the AWESOME FUCKING MUSIC playing on Friday's and Saturday's, but the other part is the lighting and interesting layout of the place. It's very unique and almost secretive. There's a weird basement downstairs that you can't get into, then upstairs is where the DJ spins incredible electronic music. There's another upstairs section with a separate bar and dining area, nice little spot to chill. You can overlook the restaurant, make sexual eye contact with the DJ, and flick water onto unsuspecting patrons. What! I have never done that. The bathrooms are kinda weird, at first I struggled on where I was supposed to go and how to open the door. It's even more difficult when you're hammered, but usually there's someone else up there wandering around wondering the same thing. Together, you'll probably figure it out. The drinks are very unique and strong. A good variety to choose from. A tad bit pricey, but it goes with the style of the bar. The food is great too. I've had their sandwiches, salads and pizzas. All were just delicious! I get very excited every time the suggestion of going to Hanny's come up during the weekend. I highly recommend this spot. :)  *Side note - only reason for 4 stars instead of the 5 - sometimes the staff can be a little snotty. At least 3 separate times I've had both bartenders and servers act kind of rude. Not anything terrible, especially for a person like me who isn't bothered by much, but just a tinge of an attitude. Eh, maybe it's a coincidence. I've also have several pleasant experiences, clearly. Hopefully it was just a bad day for these folks.",

Unfortunately, Hanny's is like a bad relationship; just because you really want it to be good doesn't mean it ever will be.  Sad sigh.   The food and service are sub-par, at best.   My most recent visit was for a friend's birthday party. Upon arriving we learned that the group would not be seated together, because her reservation was given to the owner's daughter who dropped in last minute with about 20 of her closest friends. Really Hanny's? Really?  I ordered the Roast Beef sandwich: Grilled Choice Ribeye, Nueske's Bacon, Arugula and a Fried Egg on Ciabatta Bread. Those are some of my favorite things! The result was a dry and blase sammy. We tried to order the doughnuts, hoping that something would redeem our dining experience, but the server informed us they were out of dough. Awesome.  I love the location, design elements, and drinks. However, Hanny's consistent failure to perform in the food and service categories will keep me from trying to make it work. A clean break is the best break-up strategy at this point.",

This guy who became my best friend, but whose name I never bothered to get, showed me around and I had an adventure!  I felt like a Goonie.  There's this abandoned elevator shaft with thick glass covering it so you can walk onto this platform and look down into this dizzying corridor like Jimmy Stewart climbing the stairs in Vertigo.  There was this totally abandoned upstairs with a bathroom area covered in mirrors.  Each bathroom or stall area was individual, so if you had to poop, you could totally do it in privacy, which for me is always a big thing because I get poopie stage fright sometimes and I really, really prefer to be alone.  The drinks I bought were cheap and not very expensive at all.  I think it was like $5.25 for a pretty strong gin and tonic.  It was such a fancy place, man, I was glad I just so happened to be wearing a collared shirt and pants without ketchupy finger stains.  After only going to dive bars or just drinking at home or at parties, Hanny's is a really great treat.  I wouldn't go there all the time, but if I had a friend coming in from out of town I would love to show them this place.",

( Dizzy spell guaranteed)  and the bathrooms are a hoot. They are the old Dept store's dressing rooms. You don't even know where they are since the doors are painted with figures/pictures instead of signs. The upstairs has cool decorations on the wall. Loved the mirrored hallways. The mannequin art piece when you first walk in is pretty bizarre! Not sure the story behind that one. I wonder if it is an old store mannequin. The food is nothing to write home about. The Cauliflower App Caprese is pretty tasty and the Gongozola Cheese and Pistachio Slaw is yummers but the rest of our food was plain or terrible. Their menu is extremely limited,  Paninis and Pizza and only two entree choices. My friend got a pork Panini sandwich and she said it was so dry that it was really bad. I got a regular Panini and it was just ok.The bread was very dry and the sandwich was tasteless. The dessert menu looked good but we did not indulge. Seems like they have a pretty good drink menu so maybe a cool bar hangout instead of a meal choice pick? It does have a good location for downtown activities.",

Without commenting at length about the amazing vibe created by the subtle DJ spinning in the upper-deck, or the stunning visual asthetics provided by the funhouse of mirrors on your way to the bathroom lol, lets get to the food..  Decided to start the night off with a glass of the cabernet they had to offer and my god, soooo delicious. Ended up deciding to share a pizza with my date and ended up going with the prosciutto (sp?) pizza..lets just say if im ever on death row, ill have this pizza listed as my last meal. Im quite the carnivore when it comes to dining but when my waitress insisted i leave the arugala on the pizza, I just went with it and not surprisingly was blown away.   Finished the night off with a few martinis and I was in Heaven. Highhhhly recommend the pomegranate julep martini.   Overall, I couldnt speak anymore highly of this place. Part of me wants to keep this place a secret so I have a place to call my own, but whats the fun in that?! Enjoy!!!",

This night however was not about the dinner, it was more the service.    Our waiter Gabriel was utterly disrespectful.  It took us nearly 45 minutes to get our order in for food.  Two tables came in after we did and both received their drinks and food long before we even ordered ours.  On top of that, Gabriel only came to our table when we would call for him.  He walked past us and asked his other parties if they needed anything else while we continued to wait.  Very disappointed, I hope I never have to get him again.",

One sip of my drink, however, and it all made sense.   Hanny's is a beautiful example of adaptive reuse and historic rehabilitation, but I think they went overboard with the modern decor. It feels cold and rather uninviting.   We were only there for drinks, which were reasonably priced but not so great. My sister's Pear-tini tasted like Nyquil, and my Ginger Creek was all whiskey and no ginger. We figured we just ordered the wrong things, so we went for dirty martinis for the second round. Priced at $5, it seems like a pretty good deal. However, I get better martinis at the Bikini, and that's with really crappy vodka and a pissed off bartender.  We had a good time exploring the place- the elevator shaft, the crazy bathrooms, the little make-out corner upstairs- but in the end, we both agreed that we should have gone to SideBar.

    "text": "I had heard about this restaurant from a staff member at the Children's Museum!  See? This is where talking to random people can be a good thing.  My husband and I had a chance to go out on TWO date nights this week (thanks, in-laws!), and I'm glad we chose this restaurant as one of our date venues!.  The drinks are strong but good and the menu includes some cool throwback recipes from the 1940's. The appetizers were an appropriate serving size (we ordered the bar plate and the asparagus with egg), and my husband's pork milanese was fantastic- breaded and cooked perfectly. My vegetarian sandwich was okay- a little dry, so I would recommend incorporating some sort of sauce with the order.  I agree with some the reviewers who commented about the DJ and his choice of 80's music- it needs a little house electronica.",

    "text": "I attempted to have my 50th birthday party there. No one answers the phone, and if you leave a message, no one responds. They shuffled my group of friends & family around from one corner in the back, then to the front. As more friends came in, wanting food and drink, the manager could have cared less. I was trying to get everyone in the same area instead of spread out all over the place? Nope, again, couldn't care less. My friends at the bar were ignored, or shamed by the female bartender. \"Do you have Michelob Ultra?\" my guest asked. The response from her...\"As if!\" He asked if they served anything comparable, where she promptly gave attitude, dropped a menu on the bar, and walked away. When one whole side of the restaurant opened I asked if we could all slide in there and was told, (even though they say NO RESERVATIONS), they were not available. No one sat down in the seats, so we just took them over. The food was okay, the drinks were great, the waiters were cool, and in the end, despite the manager and bartender, we made the best of it. I cannot recommend the place though because as a rule, as cool as it is, and as great as the cocktails and music are. the management sucks. If the managers cannot do their job, in a service industry, then the staff won't either.",

    "text": "I was at first impressed when we stopped in for a round of drinks on my birthday. Very swanky modern place with a fun and eclectic atmosphere and a great variety of drinks.   Our group had a $60 tab, which we paid, then moved on to another place. The next day I found out that our $60 tab got charged, as well as a second charge for $219! I called my bank and disputed the charges (which could take 10 days) and they recommended working with management at Hanny's to cancel the charges, so the funds could be returned within the hour. I found out that our server accidentally charged our card for the wrong tab, voided the transaction, and then said nothing to us (probably hoping the money would be returned to our account before we noticed).   When I called, the manager seemed nonchalant about the whole thing, never once apologized for what happened, and then said I shouldn't worry about it because they didn't actually charge my card and it would probably drop off on its own faster than he could contact his merchant services about it the following day. I still asked him to follow up, told him I'd appreciate his time, and reminded him we were talking about $220 here. He begrudgingly said he would and then didn't get back to me today. When I called, he obviously hadn't passed along the information to the other manager because he had zero knowledge of what had happened and the funds are still on hold 3 days later.   Happy birthday, right?! Hands down, a very frustrating experience and I'm not impressed with their customer service AT ALL. For the lack of concern their management and staff have for their patrons, I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.",

    "text": "Ambiance - 5. Food - 3. Service - 1. Went to Hanny's on a Tuesday night. It wasn't busy, but when we asked for a table for 8, it was like we were really putting them out. They sat us at a table for 6, so we crammed together. It's OK, we're all friends. The server didn't tell us her name the entire 2 hours we were there. She got pretty upset when one of the older people in our party (who could barely read the menu thanks to low lighting and presbyopia) didn't yet know what she wanted to drink. One member of our party ordered food while the server was taking drink orders, and that seemed to be a real inconvenience. Another member asked for a drink a certain way and was told he couldn't have it so (it wasn't a crazy request - less vermouth, please). She just seemed annoyed with us the entire time. We had told the staff that there might be a 9th person joining us, so they were apprised. When #9 did show up and sat in a chair at the next table (because there was barely anyone in the restaurant and our table was packed), I overheard the server talking about him sitting there when he \"wasn't told\" to do so. She then proceeded to tell the other server, \"now we can't seat that table.\" They whisked away one of the two vacant tables, and I asked my friend to move to our table. When the server came back and I confronted her about it, telling her she simply could have asked #9 to move, she backtracked, saying that there was no problem. I replied with, \"that's not the exchange I overheard.\" No apology, no explanation, just more backtracking. About 10-15 minutes later, they seated a party of 2 at the single table (which never had been occupied by any of us and there was plenty of room). Just really, really terrible service. I've been there a few times, have never really been blown away except by the cool old department store theme, but can't say I'll ever be back again if the decision's up to me.",

Th bartender was rude, annoying and should be on a suicide watch list. \"we are busy so you get what you get! take my card if you want to talk\"  was the manager's response when we informed him that the bartender rejected our order of drinks. If you can't handle a Sunday evening crowd, then you probably shouldn't be in business. Nothing should warrant that type of bad service! stay at home or close your doors if people coming into your bar annoys you. As a paying customer, I expect some level of customer service which obviously you know nothing about otherwise you would be happy when you see a good crowd in your bar.   If bad service and annoying staff is your thing, then this place might be good for you otherwise stay away. If you're like the rest of us looking for a good place to catch up with friend or make new one, do yourself a favor and choose another place. McDonalds might be a better choice.    A bar should serve drinks not attitude!!!",

I had to try it.  Restored into a restaurant and bar from an old department store, Hanny's has the feel straight of of New York City. The lighting is dim enough to give that sexy, intimate feelings and with long, pew style seating with individual tables, the vibe is very posh.  My roommate and I ordered the bruscetta plate and the margarita pizza. Very good choice! The bruscetta plate was on the saltier side, so be wary of that but it was delish. The pizza was much bigger than we expected. For $10 you really do get a good deal.   We each orded drinks. A orded the peach martini and a glass of giseling. Wasn't a HUGE fan of the martini and I thought it tasted like cough syrup but it was also my very first martini so I am not holding Hannys against anything. My roommate on the other hand said it was the best Manhattan he'd ever had, which I believe.  Hannys has a modern feel with a touch of Mad Men and I simply cannot wait to go back.",

    "text": "If anyone ever says to me that downtown Phoenix doesn't have cool bars, I'll send them to Hanny's.  The sister restaurant to AZ 88 is chic and totally has a Manhattan vibe, with its minimalist, modern decor and live music.  The spot is comprised of several stories, with the main restaurant and bar on the middle floors.   I had a Pimm's Cup, one of the bar's specialties, and a mojito.  The drinks are smaller portions than you might be used to, but that's how Hanny's does all their cocktails.  We shared a Bar Plate ($8.50), which is great if you love prosciutto, since there's a ton of it. It also comes with bread, cheese, olives and nuts-perfect to pair cocktails with.  My side salad ($4.50) was OK, but I wish the place served ranch dressing. I wasn't super-crazy about the Dijon vinaigrette.  And despite how much I love the cool vibe of Hanny's, the regular menu is so disappointing. If you don't like sandwiches, you're stuck with a salad or flat bread pizza. We ordered one with olives  ($12), and while I loved the cheese, it tasted more like a cracker than pizza.  The pizzas are just mediocre-I could make a better one myself, and I don't even cook. I would love if Hannny's expanded its menu or made thick-crust pizzas. Maybe if it had more to offer food-wise, the restaurant would become more popular.  I absolutely love the tiramisu ($7) at Hanny's, though, and the great music by the DJ's distracted from the so-so food. I really appreciate the live music and think Hanny's has great potential to become a bustling bar.",

    "text": "Well My wife and I spend ALOT of money eating out in Downtown Phoenix as we LOVE IT! But WOW...in reality some of the WORST service and dinning experience My wife and I have EVER had at a restaurant in our LIVES!!! EATER BEWARE!!!! We both were guesting at the convention center and brought first time guests there for a peaceful nice evening celebrating dinner and My birthday and was immediately ruined by patrons throwing drinks on all us and our guests and laughing it off as if it was a regular thing that occurs at this establishment and the staff couldn't have cared less! The alcoholic drinks spilled on us went all over ALL of our food and clothing and set the tone for the rest of the evening and even after speaking with the Manager seemed to not even phase their attitude towards the whole situation. They treated us as if they wanted to get us out of there as fast as possible. Our waitress was not attentive if she was even awake at all. Drinks took way too long for Bar/Restaurant in the middle of Downtown Phoenix! They need to get their act together if they are going to stay in business, in all honesty better service at Hooters(don't waste your money here). Or maybe they have an owner that just cares about how much money they are making and not about their customers. And yet still had the nerve to act as if it was acceptable. After the drinks were spilled, they had to remake ALL 6 of our meals and only removed one from our bill. I'd expect this treatment from a 1 star restaurant but Hanny's has convinced us to NEVER dine or recommend to anyone ever again! Food was sanitary at best if you want fresh-frozen pizza. Gordon Ramsey would have a field day with this place. Don't let Hanny's art decorum fool you either, it's a distraction from their REAL issues...Quality. It's Restaurants like this that make so many others look inviting to try. Thank You Hanny's Staff for showing us the real you and saving us money from your disgusting establishment.",

On a Sunday night to meet up with friends for drinks and apps at Hanny's downtown Phoenix, I unfortunetaly encountered a bartender who had a meltdown before my eyes.... I know it sounds like an exagerration, but literally on two seperate occassions within a 30 minute period slammed someones credit card down and stormed out of the bar area, and on the second incident his poor towel got the same treatment.  After our party picked our jaws off of the floor we called over a waitress to get some type of assistance in the matter, and so that she can get the manager for us, after rolling her eyes and screaming \"WHAT\", she rudely explained that she doesnt have time for us, nor does the manager... And she was right the General Manager said and I quote \"I do not have time for chit chat, if you have a complaint call the restaurant\" and stormed off.  By the way I am at home from work due to food poisioning from the Shrimp Prosciutto that took 43 minutes to arrive, the severe stomach cramping and diarrhea that started at about 3 am was just the icing on the cake.   And just to give you some background, I dine out frequently, over the past week Wildfish, Bungalow, Vincents, and Wendy's lol and I have a strong understaning of good customer service, and basic human interaction, and this place is lacking in all of the above.

Crumbling it myself wasn't possibly, because my server didn't have the wherewithal to even bring me any silverware.   To top it all off, my server didn't inform me that soft drinks do not include free refills, which resulted in a $9 upcharge for 3 tiny glasses of diet coke.

It has a lot of character, I won't dwell on the basement, we all know about the basement (OK, well if you don't know there is a coven of creepy dolls which congregate behind a fence, why? I'm not sure exactly).   Hanny's is more than the dolls, but not much more. The food is reasonably priced and it shows in the quality. That's not to say that the food isn't good but that's not the draw. The real reason to come to Hanny's is the atmosphere and the 5$ martinis.   Speaking of 5$ martinis I had an awkward exchange with a bartender here one time when I asked for a dirty martini straight up, he went on to inquire if I wanted that \"on the rocks\". Confused, I bantered back with him for about 5 minutes before he finally understood, it wasn't the misunderstanding that bothered me, it was the arrogance. Over the years I have come to understand that this type of hipster service is consistent at this establishment.  Regardless, I will continue to frequent Hanny's, it's centrally located, there is usually a good DJ up in the booth and the food is decently priced (they also have gluten free options).   Take the elevator or stairs up to the bathrooms on the 2nd floor. Pro Tip: The doors to all the bathrooms open inward, PUSHING is the key here.",

We ordered two cocktails, and a pizza for a quick bite. Our waitress was incredibly rude, and barely looked us in the eye- Very inattentive and incredibly impersonal . No one came back to our table after being served. We had to track down the manager to get our check who acted as though it was inconvenient for him. Very disappointing for us.",

Hanny's was a men's store in the 1940s, so some of the signage on the inside of the building still has men's clothing designers and relates to men's clothing. The clothing store was also named Hanny's. They have a great menu, fantastic service, the ambiance is pretty nice, and the food delicious! My mother had a BLT which had Wisconsin bacon on it. My sister had Gorgonzola coleslaw, which came in a huge portion. I had a portobello ciabatta sandwich made vegan, and a side of string onions. For appetizers we had bruschetta which had more of a tapenade kind of topping, and cauliflowerwiith string onions that had the most delicious fired taste It was really good. As were leaving, my mom wanted a picture of the front of the building. As I snapped the photo I noticed a bluish baby sitting on the ledge of an outside window. I called later to ask what that was all about and was told that actually the building has multiple floors which we missed completely. The basement floor has an art gallery. Jen explained that it would be very difficult to explain the blue baby without first seeing the art display in the basement. We'll go back to see that sometime. The Jolly Diners rated or experience at Hanny's as a well earned five out of five.",

The bar tender...man with the doctor's coat  approached and {without saying hi} asked what we would like to order. My buddy was thinking about pizza but asked the bartender's opinion. The guy in the white coat said the pizza is good...and that's it. We ended up getting pizzas  one with prociutto and the other with meat, both very mediocre. The worst part is the guy could not care less about us even though there was nobody there on a monday...what he did care is the  barback  vaping (thinking we did not see him). Alas, this proves the point, the place is mediocre at best, the service is lacking like they have never been trained. Bottom line of the story...skip this joint and go somewhere else!",

As I was regretting passing up the  Bojangles Chicken I passed while running between planes on my layover,  I saw Hanny's big silver sign like a beacon in the desert night.   I had been to Hanny's previously while in town for a friend's wedding and I remembered two things - they have good wine and they decorate with some creepy stuff. Undaunted by the displays of old dolls in cages, I headed inside and tried to remember what I had to eat the last time I was there.   They quickly seated me and after ordering my food came out soon after I ordered.  I sat  in a booth and enjoyed the dimly lit dining room with the house DJ setting a loungey vibe.   I got a veggie pizza and it was delicious. The thin was very crispy and there was the right amount of cheese sauce and toppings. There was at least enough for two people, so I wasn't able to finish it, but that left me with enough for breakfast in the morning.  Topping it off with a nice glass of Pinot noir made for a very solid meal.",

My bf had a meatlovers pizza, which was the best dish out of the 7 we had tried that night. The sandwiches were okay, nothing much to shout about, I found mine quite dry, so I had to request for a side of mayo. The side of coleslaw didn't really taste like how coleslaw should taste (it wasn't sweet) but the crispy string onions were good at least. For the price, I expected better quality of food. I don't think I'd return back here again unless they do better, food-wise or maybe perhaps if they have a good happy hour. My friends and I didn't really enjoy our food that much for what we paid.",

    "text": "Hanny's was one of the more interesting establishments that we visited in Phoenix. At first glance, it doesn't seem like anything special. Apparently, it is a converted department store, which explains its relatively neutral, unimpressive exterior. When we walked in however, we were pleasantly surprised. On the ground level, modern and chic decor certainly gave off a more upscale vibe. But the restaurant's decor just kept us guessing. Walk down the flight of stairs near the entrance of the restaurant and you'll find an eerie display of dolls that frankly is enough to give you a chill up your spine. Walk up to the Mezzanine level, and you'll find walls of mirrors and bright, colorful LED lights that is more reminiscent of a fun-house themed club.  The service was pretty good. They were attentive and efficient in checking on our table of 11.  The food was moderately price for the portion sizes. I had fairly high expectations given the overall decor of the restaurant, but was underwhelmed with the Carne Pizza and the Chopped Salad. The pizza was unpleasantly oily and I found myself wishing I had several napkins to blot out the extra oil. The salad was well dressed, but nothing extraordinary. The drinks, on the other hand, were the centerpiece of the meal. I had the Moscow Mule and it was absolutely delicious! If I ever go back, I would definitely order a couple of those!",

The bar in the middle seems like the main attraction of this place that also serves absinthe by the way. The server we had was very helpful but seemed to be busy.   The couch style seats caught me off guard cause when I leaned back it scared me as they reclined lol. We stared off with the egg asparagus which was really good.  For the main course we had the carne pizza which we could of had more of.  The crust was perfect and the flavors were pretty good   After eating we went and explored the place. The bathrooms look confusing to get into with the mirrors and lights.  When you get inside the bathroom it lights up a certain color inside depending which one you enter.  When you come back down there's a area that looks like a empty elevator shaft that you can stand inside and look down a few floors.   Now let's not forget the weirdest part of this place the dolls downstairs that are creepy and sitting at a table. Seems like a modern place and fun place to come back to.",

    "text": "Hanny's has been on my list of places to check out for quite some time, partly because I've heard great things about it from other people, and partly because most yelp reviews are pretty positive about this place. I was downtown anyways, so I finally got to stop and check it out. It was okay. Maybe it just didn't live up to all the hype I had heard about it but my experience was simply an average one.   We stopped in around 9pm on a Saturday and only had to wait a minute or two to be seated, which was awesome. Upon being seated, it took about ten minutes for our waiter to appear to greet us and bring waters. Look, I get it's a Saturday night and busy, but the service was pretty slow for the entire meal. On the plus side, our waiter was very nice and didn't make either of us feel like second class citizens when neither of us ordered an alcoholic beverage (which sadly, I've experienced several times at other establishments).   On to the food.. while reading the menu some dishes sounded interesting, but I ended up with the grilled cheese, add avocado, and the crispy onion strings as a side. It was alright. Edible, but not worth the price in my opinion. We also had the Margherita pizza which came on super thin crust and was again, alright. Edible but definitely nothing to write home about. For close to $40 for the whole meal I couldn't help but feel like it wasn't money well spent.   The overall vibe of the place is interesting and probably depends on what kind of scene you are into. It's definitely a hip venue but it felt a little pretentious to me. Everyone was friendly enough, but I still got the feeling that maybe they didn't think I was cool enough to be there. Just my opinion.   The most notable part about this place is the unisex bathrooms, complete with neon lighting upstairs, where hoards of girls were taking Instagram photos. Hey, I'm all for finding a good IG, but I have a feeling this is what lures in a lot of their customers.   Overall, if you want a drink in a cool place or need late night food and are downtown, this place works, but I doubt I'll be returning unless someone else makes the call to come here.",

Im not a foodie, but damn, I looked at the menu and then asked the guy if I can have the dinner menu. He said \"you're looking at it\". lol. Nuff said right? I actually could find something I wanted to eat there. Its like a Mash up of a cook trying to be  a chef but hasn't quite found his niche of compatible offerings.   Service:  I eat out a lot, so I know when a server's being a dick because they've had a bad day or just being a dick cause they were born that way.  Of the three times I've been here, the servers have largely proved indifferent in mannerisms...kinda like a \"dude, you gonna order or just fucking sit there\"....or the \"sheeiit, you spend all that time looking at the menu and thats ALL you fucking order\"....yep. nuff said.   Price:  Very good.   All in all. like my rating said \"Meh. I've experienced better\"  FYI - Trim the trees in front on your building, no one can see the sign that says Hanny's",

Normally, the service is great, the food is outstanding and the bar is the best around.  Unfortunately, our experience this past Saturday really disappointed.  As always, the food and drink was excellent, but the experience was unbelievably marred by loud booming music and indifferent service.  Now, I know that Hanny's has a DJ and loud music ... but we were in the restaurant at 5:45 PM, not midnight.  I asked the server if the bass could be turned down - something I've NEVER done at a restaurant before.  The answer we received:  \"I'm pretty sure they won't turn it down and I'm not even sure they can\".  Hmmm ....  The music changed and the distracting boom of the bass subsided for a few minutes, but another track and more annoyance.  Our server didn't seem to want to be bothered to even ask.  Sadly, I guess we won't be bothered to return.",

I do not eat pork but my friends said the proscuitto was good.  The real disappointment was the service.  We had gone for a friend's birthday and my first impression of the place was \"wow, this is cool\".  That was quickly replaced with total and utter disappointment.  The first problem was when I requested the server's reccomendation for a drink - he said the Rose is good.  I ordered a carafe, it was brought to the table and served (without them pouring a bit for my approval).  One sip and I knew it was terrible.  No wonder they didn't let me taste it first.  I asked the server if I could order a Kir Royale because I was quite disappointed with the wine.  He told me that I could, however they could not remove the Rose from my bill since it had been poured at the table.  Really?  You're going to reccomend a wine to me, not afford me the opportunity to try it and tell me you won't take it back when it's atrocious?  Sounds like a great way to sell terrible wine.  The real kicker was when one of my other friends ordered another bottle of the beer he was already drinking.  Instead of being presented with the beer he asked for, the server brought a Moretti.  My friend pointed out that it was the wrong beer and the server tried to argue with him about what he had asked for before making up some excuse and taking the beer away.  Seriously, who does that?  I probably would have given this place three and a half stars had the service not been so terrible.  Unfortunately it was and the food was not good enough to make up for it.  We will not be returning.",

I then let another member of the wait staff know that I would be back shortly to show my friend around the bar and give a nice historic tour. Our waitress then felt the need to come track me down to demand that I pay my tab. At this point I had enough of her rude behavior and just paid and left! I can honestly say I have never received such terrible service before. And from such a nice upscale bar none the less.

We were a large party so we just got a bunch of thin crust pizzas. They were delicious! - Doughnuts with Chocolate Sauce - Dark chocolate sauce with the freshly made doughnuts were sooo amazing! - If you love Scotch get the Rusty Nail :p",

We ordered some grilled cauliflowers and roasted peppers, friend string onion rings, proscuitto, and sausage pizza.  This place definitely have a loungy hip ambiance.

The happy truth is that Hanny's, located in a former men's department store in the heart of downtown Phoenix, is a shwank place for a bite or a drink anytime. And on weekends, the DJs can actually mix.   I've popped in here after the symphony to watch a bartender slice gourmet meats and cheeses to assauge our hunger. I've been after a long dinner for a bite of dessert. It's a great stop before heading down to shake your tail on Washington Ave.... I can't think of a time I was sad Hanny's was on the agenda.

This was an old department store in the late 40's, it has that vintage look to the architecture, yet the dining room and atmosphere is modern and new, hipster art in the windows, clean tables with flowers and candles, an upscale eclectic mix.  The servers wear clean white uniforms but are tatted up with hipster hair and gauged ears, this is a weird but charming place to be. I like it. Everyone on staff was pleasant as well. Never judge a book by it's cover, honestly the weirder someone looks the nicer they tend to be. I would take strange over scottsdale uppity any day!  The food is quite good. Good as in fresh, artisanal, unique, and well paired. The beet salad is fantastic, the sandwiches are fantastic. Everything is complimented beautifully, sweet with spicy, hot with cool, chewy with smooth, acidic with base. Food is best enjoyed paired with an equal food of great taste and quality, and Hanny's does it right.  My only gripe would be the music...the music selection is fine, it works for the vibe and atmosphere, it's the volume and BASS that are disorienting. The bass is seriously way too loud and deep for a dining room, it can downright annoy your ears. I know that sounds like an old person's complaint, but it's valid, the bass needs to be turned down. Otherwise, bravo.  A great choice for downtown eating and drinking, it's smack dab in the middle of everything...talking stick, united airways, hard rock, everything is a 3 minute walk away, very convenient.",

The flatbread / pizza thing I shared with my boyfriend was not great though - it was far too thin and dry.

The decor and vibe felt very dated, especially the layout and lighting for the bathroom. It made me feel like I was in a space that hadn't been updated since the '90s.",

    "text": "We have spent a fair amount of time exploring downtown Phoenix. Because of that, we often pass by Hanny's, especially after visiting Symphony Hall or on our way to the Orpheum or Comerica Theater.  After a boredom-filled Sunday afternoon, we finally committed to trekking down here to have a late afternoon repast at this establishment.  Absent were the typical impediments to dining downtown. Traffic was quite sparse. The crowds were either still relaxing at home or were intimidated by the 110+ degree weather. In any case, Hanny's was basically empty when we got there, as you can tell by the accompanying pictures we took.  As we walked in, we waited in the lobby for someone to seat us - as that is what the sign stated. Although, I sometimes ignore it if the host / hostess functions with less aplomb than I would like. After a few minutes, our host / waiter eventually noticed that we had been standing there, and kindly led us on a walk around  the facility so that we could find comfortable seating.  I will say that this place is expansive, and affords many comfortable seating arrangements. We took a table that was interposed with the reclining bench seating. It was way too comfortable, as the dreaded afternoon stupor was starting to set in. I had a long weekend of work and as my adrenaline started to diminish,  so did my normal vigor.  I must say that the decor, the seating, the lighting, and the overall environment was absolutely superb for \"hanging out.\"  Our waiter was so engaging, funny, and attentive. Of course, there weren't that many patrons at this time. But, in any case, it was nice to not have to wait to flag him down for refills or any other needs.  However, our food left a lot to be desired. The Carne PIzza had a thin, hard crust, and it was super salty! Tone down on the sodium! I'm not sure what happened to the salty crust, but it was awful.  The cucumber side salad was wonderful. The mini cucumbers were quite ripe, and delicious. But, the Adams Street Chop was dreadful. The asparagus was overdone, and partially over seared. The chop itself was quite hard. It should have a tender consistency, and not be something that requires a saw to separate, and razor sharp teeth to masticate.  Would we make a return trip here? Absolutely. On our return visit, we will probably try a different dish. Because, for the dearth of people present, we should've not had a miscue on our food preparation.",

But, those compliments didn't extend to the menu for me.   The drinks were decent/average but the food was mediocre at best. I ordered the prosciutto and frutte pizza, which sounded delicious. But it was downright bland, and legit, that's all it was: thin crust bread, white sauce, a single layer of prosciutto and a single slice of fruit. What?? I had to ask for a side of honey to drizzle on it to add some flavor dimension. But, even then, I was sorely disappointed.   Another member of the table had the margherita pizza, and was like getting a thin crust pizza from Chuck E Cheese with a few clumps of shredded basil.   Prices were what you would expect for downtown Phoenix, not cheap, but also not the worst I've seen. But, I can't say I didn't want more for what we paid.   All in all, the atmosphere and the pleasant service saved this trip, so I'm being kind and leaving 3 stars. I'd say, stop here for a drink, check out the weird / cool building amenities, then go elsewhere for food.  Sorry Hanny's!",

The crowd was very diverse and it seemed like a happening place.   The service was great, very friendly and prompt. We ordered an old fashioned and an huckleberry lemonade. The drinks were very tasty, but did seem light on the alcohol side. The pizza was thin crust and decent. Kind of like pizza chips. Their hot honey was an interesting addition, one I would recommend trying.   Decent place. Nothing to write home about, but we were overall happy with our dinner.",

The sandwiches we ordered were ok, but there is hardly any \"food\" on the plate.  The onion strings are not edible and the sandwiches lacked any meaningful amount of proteins: steak, bacon, etc.  Pizza was ok, similar to plank pizza that some chains offer.    Service was non-existent.  We never saw our waitress since placing our order, as food: app pizza and sandwiches were brought out by runners.  She never checked on our food, need for drink reorder/refill,etc  We even had to find and flag her down to get a check.  If I had a penny to leave as a tip, I would!  My son on the other hand, felt that since tips are split amongst staff (runners, busboys, etc) it would not be fair to them.  So I left a tip, but my tip on this place is to stay away!",

They decorate the place beautifully and have a holiday menu for their drinks. The menu also has a little bit for everyone and not a bad item on the menu.

I actually spent my most recent birthday celebration here with some great friends because the days of parading around half-naked in nightclubs are a tad behind me now.   They have an amazing drink menu here. The Moscow Mule comes in an adorable copper cup that makes you want to commit a small crime. I would also definitely recommend the St. Germain. It's a sweet martini, but one of the best I've ever had. This place also makes me want to buy a meat slicer and a slab of prosciutto for my own home.    Hanny's is definitely one of Phoenix's finest gems. It has a great deal of personality. Drinks, food, and tunes are always fantastic. See you there!",

Our wonderful waiter and an additional waitress (I'm so very sorry I can't remember your names! ): ) found it, called my sister, we drove from Surprise back to Phoenix, and they stayed a little late for me to come and pick it up.  THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AMAZING! You both have wonderful hearts!",

Pretty disappointing.  The ingredients were clearly out of cans, sauce was sub-par, just poor quality.  I agree that the menu does seem to be way overpriced- The service was meh, considering it was 4:00pm on a Tuesday, it could have been a little more attentive (with only 3 other tables being occupied). Went back last night to grab some late night drinks, the petite martinis.  My dirty was strong, but they are not kidding when they say petite...  Again, not impressed with the service.  In my opinion this place is way over-hyped, but it could just be my isolated experiences.",

    "text": "Hanny's is a mixed experience for me.  The decor is proper and fashionable.  The aura is [very] modern delicatessen, gone bar.  For these things, I am appreciative.  The food is tasty and well delivered.  The drinks are where the points get docked.  As expected, one should have known better than to order a WWII cocktail.  I actually ordered it, and then when he asked \"what is that\", I told him I changed my mind.  Refusal to deliver a different (see: more common) drink, I accepted his offer in attempting to make it.  I spelled out the details: dash or two of Angostura, gin and a chilled cocktail glass.  No ice.  Why is he shaking this?  Why is it in a Collins glass?  Weird.  My pink gin was actually an orange gin - oh well.  Better luck next time.  I've since switched to a martini.    -- \"A martini, please.\" - \"What kind of vodka?\" --\"What?  A *martini*.\" -\"Yea, what kind of vodka...?\" *head shakes*  No vermouth, so...straight gin?  Okay.  Whatever.  I'll let it slide.  A friend orders me a pink gin and gives the directions of how to make it.  This is unbeknownst to me, as I am conversing with another patron.  I move back to our table to find an orange colored drink, on the rocks, in an old fashioned glass.    ---\"So, I don't think this is how you make a pink gin either.\"  Additionally, said friend asks \"you have Aviation gin, right?\".  \"I don't know\", the employee responds.  He explains that it is a rhetorical question, as he saw the bottle.  He asks for a gin & tonic made with Aviation gin.  A few minutes later he is delivered a neon green glass of what seems to be nuclear waste.  Come to find out: Hanny's has a drink called \"the Aviation\" or \"the Aviator\", and that employee simply ignored the whole conversation about Aviation gin, et al.  The music here can be excellent or awful.  DJ's in training should be limited to their deck time.  +2 for the food.  +0 for the drinks & delivery.",

Great music, superior comfort, & wonderful cocktails.  The interior architecture makes me swoon... the triple laminated glass floor in the elevator shaft is particularly exciting after a few Moscow Mules. I love how the unisex restrooms are tucked away, and create an Alice & Wonderland effect of, \"which door should I go through\" contemplation. The long lazy chaise lounges remind me of a giant cow's tongue. They are an amazing place to spread out after dinner & continue the conversation.  In fact, you can even eat there if you'd like.  That brings me to the food. The food is good & reasonably priced. The portions generous & easy to share.  However, they will never win any awards, or get anyone excited by their offerings. If you're looking for something to awaken your taste-buds, then you might want to reserve this place for an evening where food isn't the main ingredient.",

They also brought bruscetta, and tapenade, which was delicious.  After a short while, they tried to kill me.  Seriously, they brought out two types of pizza; a pepperoni and sausage, and combination style pizza.  The pizzas were hands-down some of the best pizza I've ever had in my life. It was amazing.  Both come on think crust, the way pizza is meant to be. The sausage and pepperoni is now my most sought after food.  If I told you I ate an entire pizza, it's more likely an understatement than exaggeration.  I did not have any cocktails, but I love the look of their copper cups when they're ice cold.  I enjoyed myself, and will return to Hanny's, without a doubt.",

Their pizza is just as amazing. It is super thin crust, and comes with a variety of different toppings for your epicurean delight. I have also had the chopped salad, and it does not disappoint either. The drinks are good, however a little pricey. I love just a classic martini and they do it very well here. I have also had the ginger lemonade, and its good, but only if you really like ginger. Donuts for dessert? How can you not enjoy it.  Hanny's also has an interior that will take your breath away. When I first stepped inside I was blown away. It is modern and classy and gorgeous. What can I say? Great food, great drinks, and amazing decor,  Hanny's had me at hello.",

I love that about the West: there's room to waste space.  Great bar plate (olives, prosciutto, melon), except for the dry bread. Nowhere in Arizona has decent bread, though, so not a biggie.  Pizza is OK. I'd give it a C-. I like thin crust, but this was a dry, cracker-like crust. Maybe the sandwiches are better... or maybe not, given the quality of the bread on the bar plate.  What made Hanny's memorable were the drinks. They are very, very good. People are complaining about the prices for liquor, and it's True that if you order scotch at these prices you're a fool. But $10 for a perfectly mixed cocktail made with top-shelf stuff and French liquers you don't see elsewhere? Worth it. The Ginger Creek and the St. Germain with pear Grey Goose were particularly good. Beers are all bottled, I believe, so stick with cocktails.  The onion strings were good, but I was pretty drunk by then.",

I usually only have rum and diets to drink and they are basic (as would be assumed), but the one time I had an appletini I was quite impressed.  As far as the food it is pretty snazzy as well.  The pizzas are flat and cracker thin, but the toppings are generous. I love the pizza with prosciutto, the four cheese one, and there is one with apple and meat that has a unique taste to it.

Though, I first I couldn't get over the conundrum of how the 1940s inspired drinks and old lounge decor fit with the DJ spinning house beats from high above the front doors, it stills a very neat place and a yuppie hot spot of downtown.   The staff was not versed in gluten free at all and the word allergy wasn't taken seriously. When I said not bread on my salad they thought it would be okay to bring the bread on my salad. Then when I requested a new salad they didn't understand why it had to brand new and couldn't just take the bread off the current one. The waitress was very understanding and hopefully she'd now educated enough to help out the next person who comes in with similar needs.   Pass on the Mint Juleps unless your a huge fan of bourbon and check out the martinis if you want to feel swanky for the night. Don't have too many though, they're slightly pricey and having to hit the loo with a buzz will remind you of the set from Clockwork Orange.  If you're downtown it's worth checking out, just make sure you're in before 1:30am, closing time's early downtown.",

    "text": "I wish I could LOVE this place, but I don't. It's not a lounge, it's not a nightclub and it's barely a restaurant (the menu is sparse).   The Venue: It's situated right downtown and sadly most of these venues have to survive off the \"downtown tourists\" from the suburbs. My guess is that this place is aimed to give those (middle aged) people a sense of \"the big city\" and that it does. It strives to have a mature hip feel, the dinning room employs the newly popular community seating (i.e. you could find yourself sharing a bench/table with the couple right next to you), and they have a DJ playing trance music while you dine. They succeed in that regard. This does have an old skewl slightly upscale \"metro\" feel to it.  The Food:  A very sparse menu, I had the carne pizza which had GREAT thin crust but lacked much flavor.  The service: The service staff is where they REALLY fail. You can go to places like FEZ, Cibo, or Pallete and it's instantaneously clear that you are being served by PROFESSIONALS. Not so much here, quite the opposite actually. Our service was what I expect from a breakfast dinner or The Waffle House (the waitress was FAR to casual for a place like this, i.e. it was kinda a like \"so watcha want?\" kinda thing going on). And honestly, with the current unemployment rate, as well as the location and style of this place, it's completely unacceptable to me.  So if your looking for poor service in Downtown now you have three choices: Carly's, Breadfruit and now Hanny's  All-in-all ... I'd say that this place is yet another venue that regretfully caters to the occasional downtown tourist and adds very little to the sustainability of a REAL downtown (that Phoenix so lacks). It gets a \"meh\".",

You used to be my favorite place to be on a Friday night, sitting at your amazing bar sipping a dirty martini with a plate of prosciutto in front of me...but things have changed!  And not for the better!  I'm not going to lie - you've started to attract a crowd that is less than stellar.  The service has gone a bit downhill and your choice of DJs is suffering!  I used to love the random choice of older and modern day music of all varieties, but last time I was there I SWEAR I heard the same hip-hop song over and over and over again!  The food, thankfully, hasn't changed.  The bar plate, which is my favorite thing to get, remains the same, thank GOD!  It's the perfect mix of antipasto and would only be better if I had a small jar of olive oil to drizzle on everything.  And I absolutely love the spicy white pizza.    The drinks though?  Are there different bartenders?  My friend used to always drink Sazeracs there and last time they didn't know what a Sazerac was!  And my usual dirty Grey Goose martini was less than par.  I had to ask for extra olive juice twice and they used the wrong vodka.  Please please please don't let this continue - your creepy elevator shaft, confusing unisex bathrooms and random basement table of dolls make me happy every time I'm there and I'd hate to stop hanging out.",

Actually I did at first because of the retro-vibe with Sinatra playing in the background, attractive yet varied-aged clientele. Not your typical Scottsdale scene. And, of course, the martinis.  Later we returned for a late-night dinner and was just mildly impressed. The place was packed yet there was no one at the door to take names for seating. We were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar, and ordered the flat bread pizza which was ordinary but acceptable. The most annoying thing to me was the DJ which, compared with the hip lounge music earlier, it seemed he was stuck in the 80's . . . and only the bad 80's. Think Debbie Gibson, Toni Braxton, Boyz II Men. It just didn't fit.  I may return, but it will be before 8pm. Oh, and if you go, you must look in the little room next to the elevator. Look up and down through the glass floor - creepy!",

    "text": "On Saturday night we were looking for late night bite - There was an hour wait for a table at 10pm but the atmosphere is great and we were into the music. Hanny's is definitely \"the scene\" kind of place, and its fun if you're in the mood for that.   The place was packed so we went to the upstairs bar and there was no wait. I had a huckleberry lemonade and it was way too sweet for my taste so I switched to wine. We finally got our table and here's where the 3 stars come in - the service was not good, its the kind of place where the servers seem put out by you, and it was very. very. slow. It took 2.5 hours for dinner, which was ok, we were with a group of friends and enjoying their company but its not really a long dinner place since the music is too loud to talk.   I had the Americano pizza which I shared with friends and everyone liked it. Hubby had the Porchetta sandwich and it was excellent. At the end of the meal our appetizer showed up - it didn't dawn on the runner that she was delivering an appetizer to a table full of empty plates and when I told her we didn't want it, that we were waiting for a check, she gave me an incredulous look and just stood there in silence. Our waitress seemed to think it was a big favor that they were going to take the appetizer off the check and said that the bar puts out some of the appetizers and they were backed up (nevermind the fact that we'd been at our table for 2 hours by then, that's pretty backed up).  Hanny's would be a lot of fun for drinks, music and people watching, and while the food was good I don't think we'll be doing dinner again based on the service.",

You all snapped at folks like PMSing women (and you were all dudes). Just so freaking angry! I find it hard to believe that the crowd was too overwhelming, because it looked like a regular weekend bar scene in there. And customers weren't even being drunken dicks!    I witnessed service atrocities I've never before seen in my bar/clubbing history. The bartenders were SUPER RUDE to nearly everyone ordering drinks. One would cut customers off before they finished ordering and walk away. Another rather violently snatched a lady's ID from her hands. God knows who they were serving, because we all had to wait so long to order. They just seemed to move frantically without really accomplishing much.  Everyone around was complaining about the bad service. I saw some even take back the tips they were going to give. Lot's of WTFs and SMHs went on. I actually stepped out and headed to the City Center for the countdown, just so I wouldn't spend my first moments of 2012 around such negativity.   I'm bummed because I really wanted to try their Absinthe. Maybe on a quieter night down the road. Maybe.",

That went okay, then we were told if we wanted to have a seat at the bar or table, we said the bar and sat ourselves. We had a waitress named Jennifer that was absolutely rude and gave us horrible service. Whenever we asked her a question about the menu etc, she had a response with an attitude. Then she was extra kind to another couple and we started to feel a discomfort about it. We asked this other server about a cocktail drink and he snapped back at us and said.\" Wait a second.\" I have never experienced such terrible service since I moved here to Arizona! I'm absolutely appalled by the treatment as two African American women, it didn't feel at ease for us at all.  On the positive side, we ordered the vegetarian pizza, which was great at least. 1 star is for the pizza.",

As with just about any place downtown, here you will see a mixed crowd of folks which definitely lends to the charm. This is one of the few spots that people actually dress to impress, lots of good looking people in here. However, I was dressed casual (t-shirt and jeans)  and still fit right in. They have a good selection of food and drinks ( had the prosciutto pizza that was topped with heaps of arugula) to choose from. The upstairs bar is where everyone went to mingle, and the bathrooms are a damn trip. I stood there for a good 5 min trying to figure it out (pick a door, and give it a good push. If it doesn't open, someone's in there. )  Can only give it 3 stars. Why? The pizza was decent...not terribly flavorful. Plus someone at an adjacent table ordered fish and it was STRONG smelling (doesn't mean it wasn't good tho). The wait staff was very nice and cordial, but everything took too long to get. Someone ordered a drink and it didn't come till about 20 min later ( we had actually forgotten about it). That was pretty much the wait time for a drink. The food was bout the same, a little longer.",

Suitably swank architecture and decor (and patrons). I'm very glad I finally made it down to sample Hanny's, which was for years a men's clothing store, not a department store as some seem to believe.   I brought along a party of international colleagues who were hooked on Merc Bar from a prior visit. I wanted them to try something new. As we approached the entrance and opened the door, there was a collective sigh bordering on a gasp. This was exactly what the doctor ordered.   I'll hold back on the final star until I have a chance to sample their food, but I still recommend it to anyone looking for a swank experience in downtown Phoenix.",

I've visited a couple of times for cocktails and then more recently for food. The atmosphere, cocktails and overall lay-out is cool, but the food is just A-ok as is the service.   The service was pretty slow-moving and we soon learned that this is probably not the best spot to stop by if you're on a time limit. The food itself is decent, but the selections to choose from on the menu are pretty random. I couldn't quite pin point the type of cuisine this restaurant would be categorized as, but it's a hefty selection of Mediterranean eats such as prosciutto, cheeses, paninis and pizzas. The pizzas are only around $11 and they are easily able to be shared. The salads are also pretty large in size and could easily be shared as well.   In summary, this is a good spot to have a couple after-work cocktails and maybe stay for an appetizer or two, but I'll probably keep Hanny's at just that for me and choose another location for my meal, especially if I have to be somewhere!   *** If you visit be sure to visit the bathrooms on the second floor.

Even though this is my happy place on the weekends, I actually adore Hanny's on a weeknight when the lounge vibe is in full effect and I can have a convo and sip my Old Fashioned like a goddamn queen.  But I also love weekends for killing St. Germain martini after martini, rapping to the old school hip hop playing from the DJ booth, occasionally ordering a Proscuitto di Parma pizza to soak up the alcohol from the spots I hit before I made it to Hanny's (I'm talking to you Candlestick Makers at The Arrogant Butcher).  And I second Bryan B's comment about the staff - they definitely remember regulars and make sure to go out of their way to keep you happy.  I think, as an east coast birdie, a good deal of my love of Hanny's is the fact that I feel like I'm back in NYC or DC for a night, all without leaving the valley.  The starkly modern decor that embraces the bones of the old department store that Hanny's calls home is preserved so elegantly well.  And I still giggle as I snap pictures in the abandoned elevator shaft.  The bathrooms aren't gimmicky in my opinion (I love the ecstatic silhouette of the people in wheelchairs!) but you may have to walk past people that don't understand that you need to just push on doors to see which ones are vacant.  Let your city panties show and walk right in.  The menu is tasty enough, but this is a place for bar food and not necessarily a special trip for dinner.  Aside from the aforementioned pizza, the salumi plates are killer (with the prosciutto cut right before your eyes) and the sandwiches similar to the offerings at AZ88.  Eat before you come, and sip away on bespoke cocktails strong enough to set your ass a-groovin.  That's why you came, isn't it?",

It also makes me feel like I'm in that scene from the end of Drop Dead Fred when she's in the big scary house. Don't know why it reminds me of that scene..maybe the high ceilings? But that's pretty cool too.  One star deduction only because if I worked at place with a drink menu this freaking awesome, it would be all I'd ever want to talk about. In fact, I don't even WORK there and I still find ways to bring up Hanny's drink menu in regular conversation. But try to engage your bartender and two times out of three (I say this because there were three bartenders when we went and I tried to talk to all of them and only of them humored me), you'll get the cold shoulder. That's right, you will get #2 of the top ten ways to say no to drugs, circa  the D.A.R.E. program, 1994.   Anyway, I've been here a few times and have always had fun, mostly because I am all about the Pimm's Cup so if it's anywhere on a menu, I'm probably having a good time. I told my boyfriend that Hanny's was special because they actually served real Pimm's Cups and most places can't. He didn't believe me and responded that he's sure Ocean Club could serve a Pimm's Cup. I responded that I have already tried (I haven't) and they couldn't (I wouldn't know, I haven't tried). Just so you all know how I roll when it comes to challenging my unchecked facts.  I also had some Absynthe (this is what I wanted to ask the bartenders about when I got THE COLD SHOULDER). It was okay. It tasted like Sambuca but was a lovely shade of green. I don't think the kind they sell here in the U.S. have hallucinogenic properties but it was about my 6th drink of the evening so I obviously had a good time with it.  I haven't had the food but I will definitely be back for some more Pimm's Cups. I don't give a shit if Ocean Club has them.",

They do have a $5 martini but it's only for the \"traditional\" vermouth martini. My coworker had a white pizza. I had s taste but didn't like it very much.

    "text": "So, it can ONLY be a good sign when you walk into a place and see a giant wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano, right? I mean, I'm pretty certain this Italian girl could sustain herself on one of those perfectly-aged, salty wheels for, like, at least 6 months! So, I was DELIGHTED when that was the first thing to catch my eye upon entering Hanny's this past weekend.  Then, to be able to enjoy a Pimm's Cup No. 1 (Corbin's Bar & Grill is the only other place I've found it as prominently displayed in the Valley). Pimm's Cup No. 1 is an English gin-based, slightly spiced and citrus flavored liqueur. The version offered on the drink list at Hanny's is a gingery, cucumbery, bitters-like concoction.   I spent the summer of 2006 drinking Pimm's lemonade, so was excited to hear Hanny's has fresh squeezed lemonade.  But, I found their lemonade to be too sour and will probably stick with the standard Pimm's Cup next time I'm there.  As for the ambiance, I liked it. It felt crisp and contemporary to me. Also, unfinished... which it is. I'm looking forward to watching this place develop!",

    "text": "I have been a frequent goer to this restaurant while living in the city and while the food and drinks are great, the service is absolutely terrible. I have never met such an overly arrogant and prideful staff. They feel that as long as you have a minor issue, it is your fault and not theirs. For example, my friend specifically asked for the midnight martinis, it is 12:02 PM. She serves us full sized martinis. My friend was a little concerned that the waitress didn't hear us correctly, and to make sure we were not being charged full priced, she flagged the waitress over to which she says \"those are full priced martinis.\" My friend proceeds to state that we have specifically requested midnight martinis to which the waitress responds \"I didn't hear you.\". So instead of apologizing for the misunderstanding and offering the midnight specials, she retaliates and gets defensive. Because of her incompetence, we request to speak to the manager to which he towers over the table and asks \"What's going on here?\". oh hi, nice to see you too. He didn't even introduce himself properly nor professionally. I was so turned off by the negative and defensive attitude, that I have just about had it with that place. IT is not the first time I have received this poor service, and they need to get off their high horse and get their game together. Sorry i'm not sorry Hanny's, but we're going to have to part ways.  What is a huge turn off of all, is knowing that after scrolling through these reviews, 1 out 5 customers are very unhappy with the service provided and almost all have the same context, \"servers and waitstaff are rude\".   I am pleading out to the owner of Hanny's: For the sake of you're great restaurant, please hire new management and waitstaff, they are making you look horrible!!!",

They were still bland which was disappointing though. As for drinks, they have the best mojito and champagne mixed drink.  I will probably come here next time just for appetizers and drinks...since the dinners didn't \"amaze\" me too much.",

There were couples, familes with children, single ladies at the bar, etc. The mix was diverse, not sure how it would be Thur-Sat nights.  I ordered the Hanny's salad which was huge and delicious, my husband got a side salad which was bigger than most. We split the pepperoni & onion pizza. The pizza was good (I'm from Chicago's so my standards for pizza are crazy high) and had a very thin, cripsy crust. For dessert I ordered the doughnuts with chocolate dipping sauce. The outer part of the donut was perfect, but the middle was slightly doughy.....maybe make smaller sizes so it cooks thoroughly.  Overall, a pleasant experience. When we're in downtown Phoenix again we will return.",

The wine list is nice and the cocktails are inventive. Service is friendly and knowledgeable.

That probably gives you an idea of their demographic. :-)  If I'm going to be d/t, Hanny's is always in my top 3 choices of a place to start, hit and/or end up.

We inquired about the appetizer and the waitress stated that she didn't remember us ordering it, interesting because when we ordered the appetizer she suggested added additional items because their were five in our party. She offered to place the appetizer order again, not even an apology. We didn't reorder for obvious reasons.  All that aside, we were all completely satisfied with the quality of our meals.

At times, servers can be very rude and don't check up very often. Other times, they are great!   Their carne pizza is my favorite and their beet salad with shrimp is awesome as well. Great spot for late night snacks, strong drinks, and good music.",

Loud, bar atmosphere, but still able to converse without too much trouble.   Pizzas highly recommended...our party got both veggie & meat varieties...everyone thought they were yummy...thin crust, crispy & loaded with items...very tasty, & reasonably priced!  Drinks were decent; big disappointment  was for our designated driver...his diet Coke not only was expired, it was overpriced for one tiny bottle...NO REFILLS...The DD should get more respect!  But we love the quirkiness of the place...be sure to check out the completely random & bizarre basement display & the creepy, glass bottomed vintage elevator!",

I really couldn't tell you who our server actually was because it appeared that 4-5 different people tag teamed our table. I'm currently still waiting for my food , along with 3 others and 2 people at our table have already been served , and finished eating. I typically am one of those people who am very respectful to servers because I have spent years working in the industry but this server will without a doubt understand how I felt about my experience here when they ( whoever they are ) lay there eyes on the lack of tip on the bill. I will never come here again, I'll probably never dine anywhere on 1st street again just because of how horrible my experience was here. So I'll end with this, if you ever are invited to a birthday dinner or something along those lines and it is being hosted at Hannys, you most definitely 100% should be sick that day.",

    "text": "I thought this would be a cool spot to check out since it was formerly a clothing department store. We went as a big group for a friend's birthday and we were seated upstairs in a quiet and quaint area. The booths were really unique and they lean back if you applied enough pressure.  We sat across the room from the DJ who was playing mellow deep house. There was also a really grungy looking elevator shaft which looked like it was still under construction. It made the space look very gentrified and hipster. The bathrooms were also unique as though you're walking through a modern art mirror exhibit. Downstairs in the basement was a table of creepy dolls hanging out. Chuckie's kind of party.   I wanted to try their rock candy Caiprinha because of its novelty. When I got the drink, I could barely swallow the first sip. Thinking it was just me, I passed it around the table and everyone gave a similar reaction. Not wanting to send my drink back, I just asked for some ginger beer to douse the drink which made it slightly better.  For appetizer, we had the shrimp prosciutto. The shrimp were large and very scrumptious. For entree, we ordered a margherita  pizza. It was super thin crust as though the crust was on a diet war against carbs. I wasn't particularly impressed.  Hanny's definitely has potential, perhaps I'll give it another chance in the future.",

Being from the Chicago Metro area, I haven't found a single pizza joint in Arizona that is more than just okay. Thank the lord I tried Hanny's. HOLY COW!!! Their pizza is fantastic. Full disclosure, Chicago is famous for their deep dish, but has tons of great NY Style pizza which is my personal favorite. This isn't a deep dish pizza review. Hanny's has incredible NY Style pizza. The cracker crust was fantastic. Just the right amount of crunch without going overboard. I don't know what kind of cheese mixture they use, but it is delicious. The sauce is equally delicious. I took the pizza back to my hotel room and they provided small containers of parmesan cheese, red peppers, and some oregano. I sprinkled a little of all three on and had pizza perfection.   Sadly, I live just outside of Tucson on the far southeast side and nowhere near Hanny's. It will now be a mandatory stop whenever we are in Phoenix. So glad to have found a legitimately solid pizza joint in Arizona.",

Usually is garnished with an apple slice on top which is the perfect ending of this sweet drink. The pizzas are amazing, thin crust pizza - you'll see everyone with one! So so good, if you're a meat lover like me, you'll enjoy the carne:) I also love the simple house salad they have. Dressing is light, but favorable. I usually will start with that if not the onion strings. Those are delicious! Comes with plenty! This place is modern, cool music at night, always a good vibe.

What I like: the whole concept of turning a department store from the 1940's into a restaurant, but keeping or reinterpreting some of the original design features. staff is friendly, menu small but big enough to find something - it's Italianesque, think wine bar food but huge portions. They use San Marzano tomato sauce on pizza, which means they are trying to be authentic.  Why it's quirky: the glass floored elevator shaft, the last supper recreated with porcelain dolls in the basement, the unisex bathrooms in all their 1985 neon lighting and night club pounding music glory,   What's so so - the food was okay, they definitely try to be upscale, i've just had similar dishes at local places like the Vig or North, that were a notch up. My meal was under 30 and that included a drink and dessert, so overall a good deal.  And I would come back if I was downtown for a show in an upscale setting.  Unless you live downtown, I don't see there's much of a reason to become a regular, but it was a huge hit with our out of town guests.",

The bruschetta consisted of big chunks of green and kalamata olives and fresh bread, not some crappy olive tampenade. Seriously delicious. The decor, as others have mentioned, is killer - so interesting and different. The upstairs, with its fun house of mirrors, is potentially confusing if you're shitfaced, but oh well. The bathrooms are unmarked and unisex and I did hear one of my female companions squealing about poop in one, but again, oh well.   I will definitely go here again, although I agree in that it's not exactly cheap -- save your binge drinking for the Bikini.",

Also $5 martinis. Do I need to repeat myself again? To the girl who said her martini was too strong, you should probably read up on what a fucking martini is before you ever order on a bar, especially a classier establishment, ever again. These are classic cocktails or takes on classic cocktails, they're supposed to be strong and a martini is straight fucking liquor, duh you dumb broad.

The place is pretty swanky, has a nice feel, and I also thought the upstairs bathrooms were cool. Hmmm... they must be cool to get mentioned cuz who really cares about bathrooms as long as they're clean and accessible...   Anyway, I need to go back for a decent meal.

The bartender at the hotel recommended Hanny's.   The restaurant is very visually striking, with high ceilings, concrete walls, and very modern seating.  We sat in a corner booth and were pleasantly surprised to discover that the backs recline!  For our appetizer, we ordered the Asparagus with Egg.  The combination is different, but it was really good!  The asparagus was cooked perfectly and the egg and parmigiano-reggiano were good complements.  For dinner, I had the Roast Beef Sandwich with a side salad, my visiting friend had the Proscuitto di Parma pizza, and another friend had the Margherita pizza.  My sandwich was a little dry, but was pretty good nonetheless.  Both of the pizzas tasted very good and were really really big!  None of us had any drinks from the bar, but I really enjoyed my experience there, and will definitely be going back there the next time I'm in Phoenix to try out the bar!",

This is a three star place, but has the potential (IMHO) to be so much more for such a cool environment.  I think the prices are higher than they should be, but that's what it is.  Again, will update when I go back, but wanted to get my impressions down after going a few times.",

I've eaten in rural China by the way.  Phoenix is a bit of a mystery in and of itself, it's all so new, and yet there are no humans here.  The streets are abandoned both at night and during the day.  But, I digress.  The pizza for $10 was really quite good, I had the proscuitto di parma, and the beer I had from Colorado was an excellent IPA.  The side salad was also really pretty generous.  The wine list, it's terrible.  I know about wine, so I know what I'm talking about.  The 'reserve' list?  It had a $9 Pinot Gris from Washington for $37 dollars.  Stop the madness.  Great place for a bite, don't order wine. The decor was like some sort of modern Caligula meets a matador.  Strange.",

You can just lounge and enjoy some drinks and have conversations. The pizzas are yummy- it's a cracker thin crust. The decor is fun from the elevator shaft to the bathrooms.

    "text": "Hanny's is great. I love seeing these local restaurant's do it up right.  This is a converted old department store named \"Hanny's\". Hey, what a good idea for the name!   It's clean, hip, spacious and fun. I'm a sucker for a fresh flower and candle on my table, too. I once said if I lived in a giant warehouse-like house, this would be exactly how I would decorate. The seats are chic and even recline. It shocked me at first and I thought the booth was broken. There are two floors and a staircase up to a DJ stand on the upper wall. Cool. If you want the pants scared off of you go check out the old elevator shaft to the back with a glass bottom. It's a good time! The bathrooms might be the coolest part. Trust me here and hit them up. They are like little clean airplane lavatories! There are some tall mirrors and seating upstairs that remind me of a fun-house. I've never seen anyone actually up here, though. Maybe we just don't hit it at \"happening times\". The action seems to be more downstairs. Huge bar in the middle. Tons of room, and quite professional and friendly service.   The food is really good. They have a variety and Veg options available. I like the pizzas (2 people can share one if you have a moderate appetite) Drinks are good, too. It's all a slight bit overpriced, but I'm okay with that as they do serve up quality.   Prime location, diverse crowd and really like nothing else in the valley. If you are downtown looking for food or a drink, this is always my first suggestion. Now run along and play!",

    "text": "My girls and I decided to met her for happy hour on a Friday. It's relatively easy to find but the parking if you're okay with shelling out a few bucks.  There is a lot in the back to park but it requires you have a few dollars on you. Does anyone carry cash anymore? My word of advise DO NOT park at the meters unless you are prepared to run out on the hour. Apparently, the city of Phoenix is trying to make a few extra dollars by extending the meter hours. You have to pay at a meter until 8pm and that goes for Saturdays as well. And let me tell you, that meter maid stocked my car. I swear I went out a few times to throw in a few quarters and I think she was waiting around the corner for the time to expire. YES, I got a ticket!  Okay, enough about the city of Phoenix parking Nazi's. Hanny's is a delightfully stylish restaurant and lounge with great martinis. The drinks were a little expensive but packed a serious punch. There wasn't a huge selection of food on the menu but enough to satisfy most people. We each tried a different pizza. I had a margarita pizza and it delicious. Honestly, it was like three meals for me...very large portions once again.   If parking was a little more manageable, I think we'd go back. Hello Phoenix don't you want people to spend time downtown? If so, stop charging for parking and more will come!",

One was the bar snack prosciutto, sliced right in front of you at the bar. On one of those beautiful red Italian slice machines that has to be hand cranked. Second we tried the (make it yourself) Bruschetta, which we thought was a great idea, it included cherry tomatoes and olives. The bread was nice and crispy, not soaked like most places. I ordered the roast beef panino, thick slice of roast beef with arugula, bacon, fried egg, on ciabatta bread. Yup that's right fried egg, this panino just bursted with flavor. My wife opted for the BLT panino , and could not stop talking about how good the bacon was. The server was very knowledgeable with everything on the menu and very attentive.  We travel about once a month to Phoenix, and are always looking for \"New\" and \"Exciting\" restaurants. Thanks to <a href=\"http://Yelp.com\">Yelp.com</a> we found Hanny's!!",

    "text": "My buddy and gave Hanny's a try before last night's Suns game -- it was hit and miss for this establishment.  I expected more from the same guy who brought us the venerable AZ88.  What I liked:  $5 martinis and a robust wine list made for a nice pre-game watering hole for non-beer drinkers like myself.  The glasses are smaller than those at AZ88, but just as filled to the brim and at less than half the price.  The food was OK.  I ordered the chopped salad, but was surprised to discover that it wasn't really \"chopped.\" Large chunks of red-leaf lettuce accompanied by cherry tomatoes, chopped onions, and a few other ingredients.  It could have been larger and more complex.  The prices are fantastic. Brad ordered the roast beef sandwich for around $9, which came on fresh focaccia bread and was stacked with bacon and a fried egg.  He said that it was OK, but could have benefited by some more flavor -- perhaps a nice sauce.  My chopped salad was around $8, so also a healthy bargain.  What I did not like:  The service.  Our server admitted to forgetting to place our appetizer order (the bruschetta), so our entrees arrived first.  When she realized her mistake, she apologized and said that the bruschetta will \"be right out.\" However, she still charged us for it.  Not good.  The atmosphere.  Sterile and cold, with a monochromatic color scheme and too many clean lines.  It reminded me of a hotel bar in Manhattan, with minimalist intentions taken to the extreme.  There was nothing warm or inviting about Hanny's, and it's not the type of place I would have stopped in had I been simply walking through the neighborhood.    All in all a nice option for a pre-game drink or snack, but not the type of place I'd make my destination on a Saturday night.  A decent addition to the downtown neighborhood, but lacking the vibrance of a place where someone would be happy to call his or herself a regular.",

We found ourself at Hannys and had a great experience.  Their pizzas are light and tasty.  They looked like too much when they arrived, but they turned out to be the just the base we needed to get through a heavy night of drinking. The reclining booths took a second to get used to, but they just added to the laid back atmosphere once we mastered them.  OK, two friends go the tiniest 'tinis that didn't seem like much of a value, so its probably not the place for hard core drinking (I know, but these are the things I look for)  But for a relaxing cool place to start your evening off, I can still give it the thumbs up.",

    "text": "I dig Hanny's. It's a great addition to the downtown Phoenix scene, both for during the day and at night. There is plenty of parking around Hanny's, albeit at meters, but if you go at night the meters turn off at 8 pm. The space is open, so you can definitely tell it was a department store in its previous life. The elevator shaft still freaks me out everytime I go and I am still confused a bit by the bathrooms, although I am not sure if it's because they are trendy or if because I usually have been drinking when I need to go upstairs for the bathroom.  I've had lunch twice now at Hanny's and have sampled both one of the sandwiches - the BLT Supremo (it is a BLT with hard boiled egg and cheese)- and a pizza - Bianco. While I loved my sandwich, I was very underwhelmed by the pizza. However, I am not a fan of thin crust pizza, so that is probably the reason why. The sandwich was a nice size and they cooked the bacon perfectly for me. The sandwich came with some onion straws, so that satisfied my fried food guilty pleasure.   Prices at Hanny's are, for the most part, really reasonable. The pizza, which is a nice size, was $11, and the sandwich was around $8 or so. I've only bought beer to drink, but my Stella Artois on Friday night was $5. Domestic beers looked to run around $3-4. I have found the service at the bar to be fast, but table service during lunch to be pretty slow and non-attentive. It's definitely a good spot to check out when you are downtown!",

The boyfriend is a huge fan of pizza (what guy isn't?) so I suggested we finally check this place out before the show we were going to. We arrived at about 6:30 (it was a Friday) and the place was packed. Not one open table. Apparently it's popular with the business crowd for happy hour as there were lots of suits. Luckily there were a couple seats at the bar so we settled in there.  We ordered two pizzas - one with pepperoni and onion and one with prosciutto (my addition lately) and apple, sans tomato sauce. They came out relatively quickly and were nice and hot. The crackery crust makes them very different than other pizzas around town. Both pizzas were very flavorful and there was an ample amount of toppings on both. The pizzas aren't huge but there were a few slices left over so we were full and happy.  The atmosphere at Hanny's is pretty cool. Modern with kind of a retro vibe. But the best part is the bathrooms. Just check them out - trust me. It's worth going there just for that.",

    "text": "Hanny's has potential - AZ/88 is one of my favorite places in town.  The building, design, and decor at Hanny's are amazing.  The menu and service, not so much.  I'm pretty sure it was our waiter's first night serving tables - many awkward uncomfortable moments.  I ordered a $5 martini and received a half full martini glass.  Next time I will ask if I can order two at the same time and just pour them in the same glass.  We ordered the bruschetta appetizer.  The topping came in a bowl with some thin dry strips of bread around it.  The topping itself was tasty - my recommendation is for the Hanny's chef to take a trip to Postino and check out their bruschetta bread - thick and soft with crusty edges.  I found the dinner menu to be lacking in choices.  Nothing really looked good so I ordered a pizza which left me underwhelmed.  Soggy and flavorless.    My suggestion to Hanny's is to think about the successful AZ/88 combination of good simple meals combined with strong fancy drinks.  Get somebody who knows how to make an Italian style wood oven pizza with crisp burnt edges.  And I don't think anybody will mind if a few of the menu items are the same as at AZ - in particular some good burgers.  Good luck with the changes - the debt service on that building must be enormous, and I would hate to see it shut down.  ***UPDATE***  Been back several times since initial review - Pizza was much better (i.e. crispy) and the $5 martinis have grown on me - two drinks at AZ88 and I need a cab - not so at Hanny's.  I would still like to see some more options on the menu, though.",

The pizzas at Hanny's are great.  Paper thin crusts and fresh toppings make for good eating.  I can eat a whole pizza myself and still walk out the front door.

We split the bar charcuterie plate which was ok, but we all agreed it felt like they forgot something - a jam or butter or chutney or SOMETHING. Then for the salad - again, I'd have preferred chicken but we took our server's advice and got the salads with the \"thinly sliced beef\" she suggested. We were both expecting something along the way of thinly sliced beef. It wasn't until after the meal that we realized she hadn't asked how we wanted the meat prepared - probably because we wouldn't have had a choice as they obviously just have a vat of GREASY slices of beef to throw on the salads. I'll give them points for it being a lot of meat, but that doesn't matter much when you can only stomach 25% of it.  I'm being nice with the three stars, my 3rd party loved the pork entree he ordered and the prosciutto really is terrific. Oh I also went once for happy hour and they were hands down the worst old fashioneds I've ever had.",

It really is my kinda place with the very clean and modern. Something I think Phoenix really lacks. Being a proud Yelp'er, I did my research beforehand and found out there a few \"Do Not Miss\" items outside of the food. Soon after we were seated and had our drinks on the way, I headed off for the \"bottomless\" elevator shaft... Alright, alright, it was pretty cool. Look a little close and you will realize that its actually only about 20 feet down and there is a mirror at the bottom which makes it seem much longer than it actually is. I won't lie though, I still didn't step all the way in...lol.   We had onion strings for the appetizer. AMAZING!! There were a few people that ordered the pizzas. I would say this is probably the best value, dollar for dollar. I had the Pork Milanese. Often times I will go for the less traditional item on the menu. It was an interesting combination to say the least. A white marbled pork loin, that is pounded down, breaded and fried, then served with an array of fresh veggies and even more onion strings. A little salty however.   I shouldn't go without mentioning the service... Phenomenal!!   I will go back.",

We hit Hanny's on a Friday night and it struck me as one of those places that try to do too much and end up not doing much very well. My salad was okay but nothing I'd make a special trip for, my friend who ordered the Shrimp Pancetta appetizer said it was yummy, but the third in our party had the Pork Calabrese sandwich and it was so greasy I my skin almost broke out just sitting next to it. The too-loud (and \"too cool\") DJ and overpriced drinks didn't help the situation. It is a cool space and perhaps I just wanted too much, but I was simply disappointed.  I would give it another try, but only if other people were going and it was an \"I'll meet up with you there\" kind of thing. It definitely wouldn't be my pick. I hear the pizzas are a tasty option and I would give them a try if I find myself back there. Maybe they will win me over then.",

It has a nice set up, with the upstairs overlooking the bar area and the downstairs with a nice street view. But really, this place is just an overpriced bar. Johnny Walker Blue is $65 for a 1.5oz glass. The same drink, but only 1oz, is $25 less than a block away at Seamus's (you do the math, you're getting ripped off). These type of prices go all the way down to their light beers. While this is a great place to take a date before an evening in downtown Phoenix (only because it is nice inside), it's a horrible place to grab a drink with friends or co-workers.   Anyway, I will probably continue to go here for a single drink on a date, but it's not a reason to come to downtown Phoenix.",

The pizzas/flat breads are very good, though a tad overpriced.  The other items on the menu have left me wanting more, though.  For example, build it yourself bruschetta that seems to be nothing more than toasted slices of a baguette with a bowl of olive tapenade.  It is a decent place to change up your business day lunch routine, but don't count on it for a spectacular meal.",

However, my BF remembered that we enjoyed our food last time had seen other things on the menu we would try. That being said, the menu had changed since the last time we visited. We struggled to find something interesting to order. We were starving so we stayed. We both ordered one of their specialty cocktails since they seemed unique. My BF drink was not mixed well, all the alcohol was on the bottom. The drink was served in a tall skinny glass which made stirring a bit difficult causing him to spill his drink. Our server was busy with other tables so we cleaned up the mess ourselves. When our server reappeared I told him what happened and asked for a fresh drink. He looked around at our clean table as if he didn't believe us! I had to explain that we had already cleaned it up and the food runner took away the garbage in his absence. He said he would talk to a manager and walked away. Although I was offended by his insinuation, I almost felt bad for him. I thought, what kind of clientele does he deal with that he would assume we were lying about a spilled drink. He did return with a fresh drink. Overall, our experience was average at best. With so many cool restaurants downtown I probably wont go back.",

I would recommend it to people that love to hang out after late night movie or game. They have $2.50 martini after midnight. Isn't it crazy? and they taste good and the music is awesome. You have to visit the bathroom, they used to be changing room for the old department store in the 70s. It is really cool. and also you have to check out the elevator also..",

It had that artsy, creepy, interesting vibe. You have to check it out for yourself. There is a creepy kind of dungeon feel downstairs, with porcelain dolls around a table behind a wire fence. Wth is up with that? But once I saw that, I instantly liked the place even more. There is also this other room, or elevator shaft not quite sure, but it has a glass bottom and you can see all the way down. It's interesting and scary if you're not fond of heights. Our waitress/server was great. I wish I could remember her name. She was very attentive and friendly.   I ordered a Midori Sour way too sweet. I almost went into a diabetic coma, well not really but just so u get my drift. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their drinks, mine was just probably not the bartenders specialty. Overall, it was a nice place to go  and have drinks with your friends. It felt intimate. I would go again.",

Our foursome had the Bar Plate appetizer (easily enough for 3-4), Carne thin crust pizza, Pork Calabrese sandwich and a Chopped Salad (big enough to feed several people).  High marks to all of the food. Wine pours were a little skimpy but good.  Service was outstanding from the Host to the waitress to the servers.   It was so good, after the show at the Orpheum, we went back, asked for the same waitress and had dessert.  The Symphony Chocolate Crisp Cake with Haagen-Daz Vanilla ice cream was marvelous.  Don't pass up the house donuts (holes if you will) with chocolate or strawberry sauce (or both). Be sure and read about the history of the building.   The restrooms on the mezzanine are worth the \"bio-break\". A great place for very reasonable prices.   It is a place to see and a place to be seen in.  We will return many times.",

    "text": "If your looking and searching for a perfect pizza place that emphasizes minimal clutter to maximize taste then this is it!  Let's start with my fav's.  The prosciutto pizza.  And how does Hanny's pull off one of the better pizzas in the valley simply with great dough, sauce and cheese, on top of  delicious prosciutto (very generous helping I may add), arugula and parmigiana cheese?  Just know what you specialize in, keep the quality and freshness high and know how to bake a great pie.     For a side I have always ordered the asparagus with a fried egg and you guessed it, shaved Parmesan cheese!  Asparagus is always crunchy, egg cooked perfectly and to finish it off the cheese and a sprinkle of black pepper.    Liked the Gorgonzola slaw, which the cheese does add to the taste but $7.00 for coleslaw that is basically good coleslaw with Gorgonzola is a tad bit over priced.  Lastly, had the Prosciutto shrimp.  Okay I must be on some Prosciutto kick but when it's fresh sliced off right in front of you, tender and lean, one will agree that it's probably the thing to bring some joy to the day!.  Shrimp was cooked perfectly with,  you guessed it arugula and Parmesan cheese as garnish.     And before  I forget, let's talk cocktails!  Hanny's takes you back to the old gangster era with Absinthe, Chartreuse and of course their 1940's inspired cocktails.  They make a damn good Old Fashion, with a solid pour and a wallet friendly $9.00 price tag.  Oh yeah- and that means two of them for me!  My significant other loves wine and had the Sean Miner Pinot Noir, which is good and moderately priced.  Overall a great experience the many times I went and one must check out the basement (yes, just do it) and the restrooms (can't give any clues but very neat).",

Good thing I was with great company otherwise I would have moved on to the next spot. Walked in & the host was pleasant, found a spot at the bar and that's where it all went bad. The only female bartender is normally Somewhat friendly, but not tonight. She must have let someone get to her because she made No eye contact, short with words, and never cracked a smile at us (smiled & friendly with some of the men tho). We realized it was busy and she may have been covering other tables, but that's not my problem. We came in polite, smiled, said our please and thank you's....I asked for wine - can't mess that up, simple & quick for her, right? I asked for their house Chardonnay which I've never had & thought it'd be pretty easy and fast. I took a few sips, didn't like it and asked for something else. We were there to drink and I'm not paying $10 for 3 OUNCES of wine w/a side of attitude (\"Oh, so, you've never had Chardonnay before...\" ... \"uh, YES I have, I just don't like THIS Chardonnay\") So I ordered beer. Thankfully another bartender from the opposite side of the bar came to help her take our drinks and food order. He was friendly and apologetic. We decided to close the tab and move to a table to lighten the mood back up. The server was super nice! He seemed new, and may have forgotten to check on our drinks BUT his happy attitude made up for the $hitty attitude & service from the bar. We are done with this place. Inconsistent service outweighs the food. Thankfully downtown Phoenix has options! Take Care Hanny's! Let me know when you clean house.",

    "text": "I was invited to Hanny's for my first time by good friends that wanted to show us a good time. At first glance walking in, it felt fresh and new with class. First I needed to use the restrooms which is an experience with a mirror hallway and swank lighting, yet the bathroom lighting is so dark that I really wondered how clean it was in there. Which is odd because the area right outside the bathrooms is very well lit. I ignored my thoughts of the dark and likely dirty bathroom and went to our table. It took way too long to bring out the drinks and thin crispy pizza that likely took 5 mins to cook. And immediately as our food was all placed in front of us, some drunks on the floor above us poured drinks on us, which went all over my wife and all over our food and drinks. The waitress and manager said this has happened before and brushed it off like it was ok just because it was common. We actually had to ask for food replacement and drink replacements because they didn't immediately offer that to us! Insane! We made it very clear how unhappy we were about the treatment and so it was even more shocking that they only removed my wife's pizza from the bill. 6 of us there, all affected by the spilled drinks dumped on our table, and that is all they did. Comp 1 item and squeak out a forced \"sorry\". I have personally had much better treatment from just about any other place. I have had places remove an item from my bill simply because I didn't like the food. Yet this place has patrons dumping drinks and they didn't resolve the experience in a complete and professional way. And If the balcony there is such an issue for drunks dumping drinks, they need to fix that issue. They should have been more sincere in their apology and immediately told us that there would be no charge for the entire party, while asking that we please come back for a better experience. As much as I wanted to forget what happened and salvage the rest of our time as friends on what was otherwise an amazing night, instead I just kept thinking of my wife and everyone having a drink poured on our table and the dismissive actions.",

They were beyond rude when ordering Amd when I asked questions regarding the meals. But I brushed it off. My co worker came back after picking the food up and what I saw was disturbing. I literally had a to go box full of arugula and 4 pieces of shrimp. I called them to make sure that's how it was supposed to be. And if it was then I would've dropped the issue. However the waitress that answered had an attitude out of this world. She was short and didn't apologize. Her response was \" well that's how it comes i don't know what you want me to do\". I wouldn't have been upset if she handled it way better and with out the attitude. So I called back requesting the manager, really personally being in customer service she was the definition of bad service. But when I called back I was on hold for over 30 mins. I had to call from my cell phone for them to answer ans be hold that time they picked the phone up in 5 mins. The manager really didn't handle the issue any better. He had an I don't care attitude. At that point it wasn't about the food but about the service. The workers I all in countered had nasty attitudes. That's the main reason I would never go back.",

Our party enjoyed sturdy old-fashioned cocktails with loads of bourbon, a lemonade mixer (sweet and easy) and a couple of beers. The snacks are delightful, and the in-house desserts were excellent. Not a fan of key-lime pie but Hanny's, you've won me over with your version and your tiramisu is scrumptious. Flatbreads were very decent and the prosciutto sampler - divine. Be sure to check out the bathrooms upstairs in the old dressing rooms and the little room downstairs too. Love this place and I'll be back!!",

The place would be well suited for a dystopian movie where androids come to lament their lack of humanity and try hard to be clever.  The food is okay, but not a thing on the menu seemed exciting. The servers also seemed bored and/or bothered to be there. The most exciting part of my lunch there was the elevator shaft you could look down. It has a glass floor so you can see down into the basement. The glass is probably there because past patrons threw themselves down there to escape.",

I would go back just to do a little more exploring.   I wasn't that hungry when we went so I ordered only the Onion Strings.  I had never had more delicious Onion anything!! They were cut, breaded and seasoned perfectly, I couldn't stop eating them.   Boyfriend had the BLT and the bacon on it was phenomenal. If all bacon tasted like that, I sure would be one big girl. I never jumped on the Bacon bandwagon but if it tasted like that I sure would!

You walk in, you wait to be seated and what do you see wonderful service, people in classic white restaurant attire it's very classic. You get more of a New York or Downtown LA feel with the dim lights and live DJ spinning above you. It has a clean and simple menu, one for drinks one for food! What you should expect is that it's very good in its portions. A personal pizza is good for two unless your greedy, then get one for yourself! Awesome sandwich choices and if you still are indecisive get one of each, like a pizza and an appetizer or a sandwich or an appetizer! Bring friends the more the merrier or sit at the bar either way is the cool way to go. I personally love their pizza and you have no wrong way of choosing definitely tho, try the onion strings so good! I always try to stop by for a martini too, the drinks are fantastic! Overall enjoy!

Normally we come for drinks and a bar plate while we wait for even traffic to die down but this time we came for a sit down meal and it was AMAZING!    The boy ordered the steak and I had the Pork Milanese and they were both amazing.  The Pork Milanese was a very large portion for the price and there was no way I was able to finish it, even though I tried.  The lemon butter sauce was on the side so the pork cutlet stayed crispy and the sauce gave a great flavor to the dish, subtle but not over powering.  The boy's steak was tender and had a really nice flavor to it.  It came with gorgonzola (which he hates and opted out of) and even without the sauce, it tasted delicious.  Hanny's is a hidden gem in the down town area.  From the DJ, to the decor, to the elevator shaft, to the unisex restroom, this place is an original.  Plus it is always worth it to take a newbie to check out the basement ;)",

I JUST had lunch there with colleagues on Friday. Saturday, after a movie at the 3rd Street AMC, we stopped in for dessert. Geno greeted us at the door and was our waiter-THE BOMB! We ordered the 2 desserts-BOMB! Then my husband asked to see the menu for the delicious pizzas he kept seeing. So we ordered the Bianco, a white pizza but we added red sauce. What came out REALLY quick was a Margherita pizza and I say that because we saw NO signs of the cheeses of a white pizza. It was tons of red sauce, cherry tomatoes and strips of basil. The server, who even called it a Margherita, initially, was unsure if it was ours, which we said no we had the Bianco with red sauce-he left came back and said, no this is yours. So I said, no that is a Margharita pizza. He left came back, then showed me the order receipt. I don't care what the paper says this looks like a Margharita pizza or a OVERCOOKED white cheese pizza with red sauce. He GOT PISSED and performed; shoved a chair and talked under his breath loudly. Excuse me!??? Who does that? We did not try to convince him to eat some crap that was sitting in the back that he didn't order???!  Again, he comes back to the table peddling this pizza. ABSOLUTELY NOT we are not interested. He performs AGAIN! Mubbling,\"I'll gladly leave...\" We spotted our waiter who saw the pizza and said, no it was wrong. BUT  now the manager comes out peddling this Margharita pizza to us. My hubby was like, I will NOT eat this thing they keep bringing out because I don't know what has been done to it at this point since the server was INSENSED about me questioning him. I have been there enough times to know it was a Margharita pizza or you have baked the hell out of this white pizza with sauce pizza. The strips of basil laid across the top-Dude that is not the Bianco. I talked to the manager who insisted it was what we ordered and I expressed the issue is no longer the pizza - WE will not eat it, but that guy's behavior, which was ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE! The manager agreed, but I left there SUPER STEAMED and just highly offended. So I have some thinking to do. Maybe this was a bad night for this dude and immaturity took over and I should not paint Hanny's with a broad brush-? This rubbed me raw Saturday, so maybe I just need to heal. Geno was the BEST! He greeted us at the door and was SUPER apologetic! We tipped him more than 100% on the tab which the manger did comp 1 of the 2 desserts.  AWFUL situation! We were having such a nice evening and we were enjoying Hanny's. It is in the neighborhood, I brag about it to my neighbors in the building, but NOW...",

Great local place to if your in the area but I wouldn't make a special trip here.   1) Menu Selection is shy and a bit small (especially the lunch)  2) Service is better at the bar than dining  3) Quality of food was sub par compared to ambiance and environment  However, if you're aiming for a coffee/drink only kind of place to host a business meeting in the area then this is a great dig!   Otherwise, there are thousands of other food options in downtown to enjoy other than Hanny's",

Yes, we went on a Sunday and, yes, it wasn't busy. Service was spot on - thank you Benjamin!   We scoped out the menu ahead of time - five dollar martinis, yes please! My husband opted for a couple of classic cocktails and loved both.  The little snack plate that everyone raves about is worth it! Proscuitto is cut fresh at the bar...rare in the U.S. It was the perfect plate to snack and enjoy a cocktail. Thank you to our server for letting us pace our evening!  We ordered the Rocket salad - love they call it both arugula and rocket on the same menu! We are always ok on sharing a plate, yet our server had it split on two plates - huge salad and easy to share. I love arugula and this was probably the most perfect balanced dressing (what I strive for at home) with great shards of parmigiana...yum!  We had the prosciutto pizza. The crust is cracker thin which my husband loves and I loved the fact it still tasted like a real crust. Fantastic San Marzano tomatoes, fresh cheese and toppings - perfecto!  My husband loves dessert, but we usually skip it. I told him he should splurge and mentioned the strawberry long cake that Yelp raves about...everything on the menu sounded better, but he went for it and loved it. Imagine the strawberry shortcake ice cream bar from the the elusive ice cream man...yum.  Great environroment, great food and great service!",

The basement can be described no other way but creepy. I won't ruin that either. The pizza is very nice especially with a cocktail, great bourbon selection btw if you're a bourbon head like me.

I've always supported this place. I've literally been coming here for years. Tonight, after leaving Symphony Hall, we met a friend at Hanny's. Upon arrival, he was asked to leave. The bartender approached us and confronted my friend regarding the ex-girlfriend waitress lying about a 'pending restraining order'. There is no restraining order against my friend. He actually hasn't spoken this person for 2 years. After ordering a beer, he was asked to pay for the beer and leave. It was very awkward and embarrassing. Good luck Hanny's.",

Everything is good here! Appetizers, sandwiches, salads, pizza...all fantastic. I always start out with the snack plate...Hanny's version of a charcuterie. (Prosciutto, salami, cheese, green and Greek olives, pistachios and bread) all for $7.00. Yes the price has gone up $2.00 since my last tip a couple of years ago.   Best thing in the house has not gone up. Ready for it?? Vodka or gin martinis are always $5.00. So are Jack and cokes! Martinis are served traditional straight up, dry or dirty with olives. Small up charge for blue cheese stuffed olives. Jack and cokes are served as a glass of Jack Daniels and a bottle of Coke on the side, you can \"season\" your Jack Daniels however you like.   I really love their pizza. Many to choose from, all pretty large dinner plate size on thin crust. Perfect for sharing, but I can usually finish one. My top three are the carne (sausage and pepperoni), Americano (sausage, sauteed onions and mushrooms) and the prosciutto e mella (prosciutto, apple and fontina cheese) this one doesn't have sauce. Delicious! The fontina cheese really makes this one stand out, the other pizzas are made with an Italian cheese blend.   Salads and sandwiches are good too!  Best dessert on the menu, the strawberry long cake. Yep I said long cake. It's an ice cream cake version of a strawberry short cake but probably ten times better. It's long, but I never want it to end! Yum!   Another point of interest on Hanny's is the building. It's actually an old men's clothing store. They have kept the building pretty original and it's really something to see. From the creepy basement with an art display to the individual bathrooms that are converted fitting rooms. Pretty cool place.   There is a DJ most nights of the week.   Impress your next date and bring them to Hanny's! Kitchen cooks until 1AM and bar pours until 1:30AM every night.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Went to Hanny's with a friend to have drinks after the concert and had terrible service.  First of all it took awhile to get the attention of the bartender Cole- and when he finally came over he wasn't very pleasant.  I ordered a Michelob ultra which apparently they don't carry, so I said just to give me a light beer.  I noticed several other people at the bar were served beer in a nice glass- I asked Cole if I could have a glass, and he responded, \" I didn't think you wanted one with that beer\".  Needless to say I was shocked.  I couldn't believe the utter arrogance.  We asked to speak with the Manager.  We explained this to the Manager Renee and couldn't believe what he said- he told us, \"just don't tip him\".  My friend is in the hospitality business and she tried speaking with him and he just was not listening and walked away.  We plan on following up with the General Manager because this type of service is unacceptable.  We said we were not going to pay for our drinks and left.",

The food is way over price and decent My problem was with our server she didn't find the need to let us know that the gratuity is already included 18% I find it funny that we need to tip on top of the tip  Accept this is awesome the music is good they have a good DJ but nothing more than that so if you're looking for atmosphere that's the right place if you're looking for food that's not a restaurant",

Downstairs is a creepy but kinda cool display.   10/10 I would recommend! I'd say its one of the cool phx must go restaurants.",

It is a fun experience, and the pizza was AMAZING! It was so  fresh and delicious, and I had a really great alcoholic drink as well. I can't recall what it was exactly, but it was blue and very well made. I'm really picky when it comes to drinks, but this one was perfect to go with our pizza. The waitress was friendly, the service was quick, and the only downfall is that some menu items are a little expensive! I wish they did stuff for birthdays! Overall, it was a fun experience with great food and I'll definitely be back!",

Very knowledgeable and all of her recommendations on the menu were so damn good! Go request her and ask for what's good, you will love it!   The building in itself is worth going to see, an old department store building and they've kept some of the old architecture that makes it super cool. And the bathrooms!! Lol The main dining area is super comfy and modern, the booths even recline which make it really hard to leave after a large dinner. The menu has limited options for dinner entrees but don't let that discourage you from going. We decided to get a bunch of of starters and a pizza OMG. Obviously you can see my excitement so I don't need to keep going but I definitely could!",

Like they say, good things come to those who wait... and good things came. First was our server Kevin. I recently hurt my thumb and I asked if I could get some ice for it, he responded politely and provided a bowl of salt ice water. It slowed me to rest my thumb in it( long story on how I hurt it).  We ordered the gorgonzola and pistachio cold slaw... it was delicious (note to the chef, try adding some juilian sliced apples for a crisp sweetness). And the prosciutto a mela pizza... it too was wonderful. The crust was more of a lavash pizza crust, very thin and crispy.   The ambience was very Cosmopolitan and upscale, still not sure what the lab coats represent.   I look forward to returning during our next trip here.",

Upon my most recent visit the host told my friend and I that there was going to be a 35 minute wait which I said was fine. He didn't say anything after and I had to inquire about putting our name on a list then he says \"uh sure\" and writes it down on a sticky note... he never came to inform us of an open table. Nonetheless we found seats at the upstairs bar! The female bartender was extremely short and rude to us and it really caught me off guard.. my friend even leaned over to whisper to me that she was really killing his mood. She had her friends sitting on the other side of the bar and I could hear her complaining to them about being an open to close double and that her managers begged her to do it. I feel for her but the negative attitude really set a sour tone to our experience. My friend, a vegetarian, mistakingly ordered a salad with prosciutto which he didn't know was meat. We were trying to get the attention of the bartender but she was still ignoring us (which is tough to do because there's only 6 barstools), deep in conversation about her recent marriage and when he asked to change his order she scoffed and said \"I sure hope so\" and stormed off towards the kitchen. Regardless the food and cocktails were amazing and thanks to the downstairs male bartender we left on a positive note! We stopped for a quick second to grab one last shot and he was very personable and friendly. I definitely recommend coming to Hanny's because although the service is hit or miss the food is amazing and the ambience is very fun",

We selected a lemon vinagerette, it tasted as bad as it sounds.  We ordered Coke products and they brought them out in 8 oz aluminum bottles...non refillable...it's obvious they want you consuming copious amounts of alcohol.  I think next time we have a late night hankering we will grab some wings from Buffalo and use the gas station for drinks...better taste, better value and better ambiance.",

I've been here dozens of times over the last 8-10 years and every time is filled with extremely tasty and fresh food, equally as good drinks, and a very friendly and accommodating staff.  Plus the atmosphere is fun, the decor is retro-modern and light, and the vibe is very cool.  I don't know what else people want or need but I can't complain about this place, and I suggest you go, like now!  You must try either of their pork sandwiches, and definitely the prosciutto pizza and donuts.  The bathrooms are an experience of their own, and make sure you check out the basement.  You're welcome!",

The cocktail was pretty delicious and also very strong. The pizza was thin, huge, and crunchy. It was pretty good I just wish it had more ingredients.

    "text": "Hot damn I love Hanny's!  When I originally moved downtown - this was one of those spots I was uber excited to be near! Let's be honest, $5 vodka martini's all day every day would win me over pretty much anywhere - the fact that they're actually delicious is an added bonus! I also love that they unapologetically (is that even a word) stay open and serve food late every night of the week - a rarity in the downtown area!  Don't get me wrong - their food is top notch as well. If you love salty cured meats the way I do, order anything with prosciutto (or hell - just get some of it by itself on a plate - yum-o!). I've admittedly tasted pretty much every pizza they have and you really can't go wrong. I'm a particular fan of the Martini pizza (I know - shocker) they have on Sunday's and some special weeknights. My bestie swears by their asparagus with fried egg. I also looooove the pork milanese - the onion strings and clarified butter really make it top notch!  Obviously this place is quirky - if you're not familiar with the bathroom situation you're in for a silly treat - I recommend getting that sorted out before having too many martini's. The elevator shaft is pleasantly nauseating. During the holidays they have beautifully bizarre Christmas trees (this past year it was made of martini glasses), and despite the picture of the dolls downstairs, I've never ventured down there because I'm too chicken.  Cheers to staying blissfully drunk and well fed!",

The ambience (department store layout with elevators leading to the vintage mirrored bathrooms & the downstairs basement showcasing the killer dolls,)  the prosciutto pizza, GOOD music (i like the selection of their DJ's here for the music they play which isn't everywhere in PHX-gives me energy,) delicious martinis & most importantly the service is always on point. Without a doubt I've noticed the servers are very consistent with carefully serving the martinis that are filled to the brim from spilling on the table. This type of consistency with good service & simple food is dually noted.   I frequent this spot from time to time, whether its packed or not doesn't really make a difference because the service & drinks have always been consistent. For that Hanny's earns its full stars.",

Their moscato is so good not to order!! And the Margarita pizza is a must! My friends and I order 2 or 3 and just eat that with some wine! So perfect!! The cauliflower app is just great! And get filling!! everything is honestly priced so so well! And okay the vibes and the workers in their little lab coats is just such a fun spin on the restaurant scene! I always recommend this place to people coming from out of town bc their is truly no other place like this! The bathrooms and downstairs are just a fun twist to it all. So much fun to bring people here that have nvr been! This will always be a favorite spot. Oh and also!!! MY SERVERS ARE ALWAYS GREAT!!! I always get the same couple servers and they are absolutely the sweetest and most polite to me and my bf!! (There's one with bangs, and one with shorter streaked hair) love them!",

Hanny's cut own beautiful shade trees that they claimed were damaged in a storm. There is no proof of this. Experts and organizations had checked on the trees and determined they were not damaged. Hanny's has previously asked the city to remove the trees and were denied. Something doesn't sit right about their story.  I will not be visiting Hanny's and will emphatically discourage others until new shade trees are replanted. And no, the weed-like plants Hanny's has put in is not good enough.

I think it was an old department store.  It is a great place to go for drinks, they are very reasonably priced and I haven't found them to be weak at all.  On my recent visit I ordered a \"classic Manhattan\" cocktail and the waitress told me about their \"aged Manhattan\" which was not on the menu.  It was quite tasty and very smooth.  It was a couple of dollars more, but it was very good.   I also had their beet salad (there will be a theme here...I will almost always order it, if there is a beet salad or beets of any kind on the menu).  It had arugula, goat cheese, pistachios and a really nice light flavored dressing.  The pistachios were a very nice touch.  Very good.  I have also had their bar plate appetizer.  They have a nice selection of cocktails and nice menu with salads, pizzas, and appetizers (I think that they have sandwiches too, but I usually skip over those).  I will definitely be back again.

A.) Try the Cauliflower & B.) Use the bathroom.   A.) Cauliflower is so f'ing under-rated. Esp. when you come up with a genius idea to pair it with bell peppers, onion, mushroom, red pepper flakes and ONION STRINGS, are you joking me..?! This shit was delicious! Totally try it. Next time I promised myself I would try the asparagus with egg.. anything topped with a fried egg has to be pretty money.. so, that is now on my to-do list, and I can't wait.   B.) Bathrooms are a TRIP. Lets put it this way... Have you ever played Kingdom Hearts and gone into the widget room that looks like a crazy maze (yes, here comes the nerd in me), or watched Alice in Wonderland while on psychedelic drugs (okay, me neither but I can imagine its comparable).. mirrors, everywhere, colors, lights, vacant elevator shafts with glass bottoms, unmarked doors, which I can only assume used to be dressing rooms at one point considering Hanny's used to be a clothing store, only one sign that says \"men\", so ladies, don't even worry about it.. just walk in any one of the doors and you're in toilet heaven, I say that because every one of the rooms I went in was CLEAN.. and I went in a few because I have a bladder the size of a 3 year olds. I could also see some of the surrounding corridors being a wonderful place for a generic drunken photo shoot.. (or maybe this has already happened.. I'll never tell).  OK enough about the bathrooms, but they are just THAT cool.  I like this place even more than I did before. Service was as excellent as the last time and plenty of cozy seating to accommodate the group I was with... For some reason it gives me the feel of something I would discover in Manhattan, or the South End of Beantown. This place is truly a DT gem.",

We had a antipasto platter of dried meats and cheeses... chatted with the super nice and highly articulate bartender.. even comp'd us a martini that we didnt quite 'understand'... he just said, 'try it' .. Theres a DJ and he spins cool music that doesnt over power you..and you dont even have to yell to be heard over the music... bathrooms are up stairs... and thats kind of cool too... have your date walk you up... and look down... go there.. you'll know what I mean....",

The drinks we had were pretty strong, small but strong but the bartenders are NOT the friendliest of the bunch. I get the fact that you are busy but  you can pretend to actually like the customers you are serving. One of the bartenders got upset because a patron was saving a seat next to her for her friend who was trying to find a parking spot. He said to her that since it was soooo busy she could not save the seat (since there was this massive line of people waiting for said seat-- said sarcastically of course) We were a little put off but whateve. Or when the group that was celebrating a friends birthday and the birthday girl asked for suggestions as to what would be a good drink, he told her to read the menu to see the ingredients in the drinks and go from there. Ouch! However It didn't stop us from having a good time, it just made this review even more interesting.  All in all, great people watching, small,expensive but strong drinks, and not so friendly bartenders.",

Sure, variety is nice but not in and of itself.  I found the wait staff both unhelpful and unpleasant, a very unfortunate combination.  The food was flavorless (the beet salad was right out of a can?) and the drinks small and pricey.  Five of us rang up a $200 bill with a bit more than usual drinking, all in a failed attempt to find the sizzle in this dud.  I'm all for downtown establishments but they have to meet a modicum of quality and value.  In my opinion Hanny's does not.",

They are also one of the only restaurants in downtown Phoenix serving food past 10om. Who knew?? I would also recommend going to the bathroom before you get a few drinks in you. Just like AZ88, the bathrooms here are a major part of the restaurant experience. There are no tvs here which I kind of liked.",

It was good, not fantastic, but better than your average bar food. The service was stellar - friendly, attentive.

    "text": "When I returned early December for a birthday get together (mine), I was suddenly nervous about having dragged about 15 Tempe residents out to downtown to a place none had been to and most had never heard of, where there is NO parking and drinks are relatively expensive.  But Hanny's didn't make a fool of me. The server - like last time, was charged with serving an amorphous group of fast drinkers who kept wandering off to take pictures, play in the elevator shaft or slide on the tongue couch - excelled. Patient, friendly and informative. In fact, when some drinks erroneously landed on one person's tab - there were several separate checks at our table - she removed them without awkwardness or even so much as an eye roll. Music neither impressed nor (more importantly) annoyed - mostly soul and R&B mixes - and the disappearing/reappearing DJ trick is a good one. I was almost talked into moving the party to the District, where I was told beers were $3 and the atmosphere was something I might enjoy. Glad I didn't (esp. after reading some of the yelp reviews for it!)  Hanny's, I will continue to make the effort to come to your establishment, which is neither close to me or easy to: find/send people to/park around. You're asking a lot, but keep up the good work, work out the kinks and I'll keep making the effort.",

    "text": "So much potential, yet so lacking -- especially when compared to the timeless awesomeness of brother AZ88.  Everyone else has summarized some of the low points (e.g., low energy).  I'll just recount a ridiculous interaction with a large man who I think is the manager.  This place seems to be very proud of its prosciutto.  Fair enough.  I ordered a couple of things with the prosciutto, like the prosciutto-wrapped shrimp.  After tasting it cooked and wrapped around the shrimp, I wanted to taste it on its own.  But we had already ordered drinks and plenty of food.  We were sitting at the bar when the manager came over to slice some prosciutto.  A few scraps fell on a plate; I asked him to try a tiny taste.  Sure, that's not a normal request at a restaurant, but it's not totally out of line, either, especially for something like cured meat.  He snapped back at me, \"This is very expensive.  If you want it, order it and pay for it.\"  I thought he was joking.  He wasn't.  I thought that reaction was uncalled for.  It's very expensive?  Give me a break; it's on the menu for $4.95.  The manager cemented my impression of him as a loser when he talked complained about another server to the bartender, within earshot of me and everyone else at the bar.  He called him lazy and \"not all there\" because he couldn't understand some people's orders.  That's a discussion to take in the back, not at the bar in front of customers.  And please, get off your high horse about your $4.95 prosciutto.",

There is no doubt about the weirdness of those dolls, arranged to look like the Last Supper. (Sidebar, there is also one doll sitting on a ledge on the outside of the building. Also weird). We decided to stay for some drinks and glad we did. I really like the overall vibe of the place, assisted by the DJ. The service at the bar was a little slow and we didn't get checked on all that often. Two of three people I was with did not enjoy their drinks at all. I had wine, so it was pretty standard. None of us had ever had absinthe before, so we inquired about that and we were given some good descriptions of what it would taste like and the difference between all of them. We went with the one they said was the smoothest. Now I cannot blame the bartender for the quality of the drink because it tasted just like he said it would, like black licorice. Not a great flavor, but glad we gave it a try. Though we didn't order good, it looked good, I don't know that I would hesitate to return.",

For some reason I always go to the small upstairs bar too, I always feel like it's a better experience, more personal... Also because I get to walk by the cool bathrooms... They used to be dressing rooms apparently because Hannys was an ex mens clothing store... It is always super dim in the evening, which is pretty nice... There is also a DJ that spins and his little space is in the East Wall... Once I stumbled downstairs to like... The basement and it was kinda scary... There is an odd little doll show of some sort down there... It legitimately looks straight out of a horror movie...

Now let me tell you why.  1. Wine. Delicious red wine.  I can't ever remember which red I got there the last time, so I usually end up switching between a few different ones that I enjoy.  Not only is their wine list satisfactory, the cocktails and beyond awesome too.  2. The cauliflower appetizer.  I never thought I would want to go to a restaurant just to eat cauliflower, but Hanny's has changed that.  Try it.  3. Hanny's has taught me to love beets.  Their beet salad is amazing.  Seriously.  If you are looking for a fresh, light meal- this is perfect.  Get it with goat cheese.  4. The bathrooms.  So they are kind of creepy, but so fascinating. Am I alone in my thinking here?  Maybe ignore this part of the review because I have really only been to the bathrooms there after drinking the aforementioned wine.  Probably not a reason to go to Hanny's, but check them out if you're there.  5. I have never had bad service.  Servers are at the least professional and efficient, and often times friendly and engaging.   Everyone I have ever gone with has enjoyed their food and drinks.  Hopefully you will as well!",

They don't have a happy hour, but their drink deal is a classic martini for $5. We both got a drink. For food we ordered the snack plate and prosciutto pizza. Snack plate had some meats, cheese, olives, pistachios, and bread. It was fine, nothing special. The pizza crust was super thin and crispy which I love, and the toppings were fresh and tasty. Prosciutto is a little tricky to eat on pizza, but I've had that issue before and expected it. The building is definitely unique, being an old department store. We checked out the old elevator shaft and also went upstairs. The biggest downside was our service. None of the bartenders (there were 3 I think) were very attentive. Kind of felt like we were bothering them when we asked for anything. Not a fan of that. Overall it was all just OK, probably will not return.",

When we first walked in the staff looked at our group like it we were a fish out of water and was put out to seat us.  Our server was only pleasant enough but I felt like she ignored our table except when we asked for something specifically.  I did not eat anything but tried their house martini.  A mistake I won't make twice.  I'm sure it was a fine martini but it definitely was not tasty to me.  The server did bring me some coke so that I could mix it and at least finish my drink.  The most fun came in searching for the bathroom.  On the way they had an empty elevator shaft with a glass bottom so that you could step out on it and look down.  Kind of fun actually.  Once I made it upstairs it was not easy to find the bathroom that was located at the end of a hall of mirrors.  The doors have no outside handles so I walked past them initially as with the mirrors and the dancing figures painted on the doors it felt more like a dance studio then a bathroom.  After much fun searching we discovered that if you push the doors it opens into a bathroom.  Kind of a fun set up once your in the know.   The atmosphere to the place felt like high end high class dining.  I am not sure that I would want to return for drinks but maybe once to try the food.",

We saw a faint sign that reminded us of Handeez, so like any fine liquored up gentlemen, we dove right in.  The bartender was really nice and complemented my fine mustache and I was like thanks bra.  He also recommended the best goshdarn roast beef sandwich this mustache has ever had the pleasure to rub up against.    Unfortunatley my freind, Chip Waddell insisted on getting a sample of proscutto, but they were not having it because the leg cost $500.  Chip flipped his bit like, \"good lord, I shoot dem hogs on my farm for free.\". I was like word son.  Bottom line good sandwidch, but manager cant handle his biddniss like a True boss.",

Check. Dolls in the basement re-enacting the Last Supper? Check. (Seriously- go down and look at them. And don't blame me for any resulting nightmares.)  Not only is the atmosphere really intriguing, but the menu is pretty interesting and everything I've tried is delicious.

I have since visited two more times for drinks and apps and a bathroom stop. More on those.   I was expecting some sort of sports bar type joint for some reason, I don't know why. Well, it is the polar opposite. Another hip downtown bar/restaurant that looks more like an upscale clothing store. Which, I found out it used to be. Ah-ha. The bar is in the middle of the joint and is brightly lit and open. What's cool is that they serve this thing called a \"small plate\" with prosciutto, fresh Parmesan, roasted pistachios, kalamata olives, and roasted red peppers. They slice the prosciutto and cut hunks off of a wheel of Parmesan right there. Awesome touch! Plus it tastes great and is only $4. The beer is also icy cold. I have also had the cauliflower, which has mushrooms, red peppers, chili flakes, and shoestring onions. This was really good as well.   The bathrooms. Everyone talks about these things. They are upstairs, down this Star Trek-esque corridor with mirrors and tiny tiles. There is only one marked door for a restroom(Mens). All the other doors are for stalls, I guess. I haven't stopped at any of those. They are sexy bathrooms. My guess was that these used to be dressing rooms. The DJ \"spins\" music from his laptop in a little nook upstairs.  This would be a great place for a first date or after dinner drinks on a first date.",

    "text": "I was excited to try Hanny's out.  We had a decent sized group of 8 and we had a good table and were very comfortable.  The service was a bit slow for not being a packed house but our server was newish and she tried really hard so that was all that mattered-- practice makes perfect,  I get that.    The menu is pretty limited to some sandwiches, pizza and salad--  I knew this going into here.  My chopped salad was good (well as good as a salad could get).  The pizzas were good and friends enjoyed those.  But unfortunately the sandwiches were lacking.   The meats were overdone completely and the bacon seemed to turn to dust once bitten into-- YUCK!  I don't even think the guys even ate the sandwiches.  They told the server that they were not good and didn't want new ones since they were eating the pizza instead from others at our table.  They took the sandwiches off the bill once they knew they were not happy with them.  I think this is standard practice especially if the food wasn't eaten.  ( sidenote** I hate when people eat the entire meal and then complain that they didn't like it and then expect it taken on the bill--- don't eat it if it was that bad.)  Hanny's is a very cool atmosphere and fun and hip, I would definitely return for drinks and I want to try out the pizzas next time.  I'll go again.  I am sure you already heard about the swanky bathrooms and elevator and all that jazz so I won't go into it.  My only problem with the bathrooms was that there was no place for me to put my coat.... that sucked and the soap dispenser involved having to pick it up and squeeze it into my hand (it was a clear ketchup squeezer with the tip), I hate touching more things than I need to in a public bathroom.   Still giving it an A-OK, next trip will hopefully be better!",

In terms of drinks, my peach bellini was tasty and (thankfully) heavy on the prosecco, and the few sips of St. Germain I tried were absolutely phenomenal - easily the best drink in our party of nine.  The DJ was great the night we were there, the overall look and vibe of Hanny's is very hip and classy, without making me feel like I should be trying harder, or acting more pretentious.    (The upstairs mirrored makeout nook and elevator shaft are just as great as you'd imagine!)  However.  Our drinks took FOREVER, and our waiter was not very helpful for recommendations, or in giving descriptions of the drinks (\"Uh, there's bourbon in it?\"  Thanks, but I was looking for something a little more detailed than repeating one of the SIX ingredients in the drink...) and my friend's martini was far from dirty.  I'd definitely go back, but there are things Hanny's could (and should) look to improve.",

    "text": "Ooo~Ooo - pick me - i want to be review # 100 - that's a nice rounded number, for a bar which rounded out my otherwise not-so-fabby night downtown.  Not being a frequent patron of the downtown environment, it was interesting to pound the pavement previous to a broadway show, scouting out for a chic wine or martini bar.  I wanted to find a place close to the Herberger Theatre - you know: since parking is the cost of a martini!   Also, since I luv my red wine, I needed a good wine-by-the-glass list, (whch, considering how many sports bars i passed on the way.... pickings seemed slim...) and hubby luvs the dirty tini, hence a wine/martini bar a looking we went.  Some healthy, non-fried snacks would be nice by now too :-)  I'm happy to report that this establishment fit the bill on all accounts.  The decor is sexy, sleek, and urban cool.  Everyone was dressed in office attire of suits, dresses or shirt & ties.  Sitting at the bar, it was good to see it only took a quick glance at the easily read menu to make a prompt decision.  The menu is great for making a fast and easy choice for a mixed drink, martini, white or red wine by the glass, and appetizers picks that were decipherable, (ie: nothing making you need to ask \"what the heck is this?\").  Our bartender was exceptionally efficient with serving, as well as understanding we were in for a quick nip, and needing to dash as soon as we enjoyed our drinks & a great little bar plate of pistachios, olives, salami, prosciutto, ciabatta and parmesan.    Thanx for a good start to our evening, even though the show we saw sucked.... ah, well... c'est la vie - Not your fault Hanny's !",

    "text": "I always run into the same old friends in Downtown Phoenix.  This always reminds me how (though MASSIVE) the city of Phoenix has this little niche downtown where everyone seems to know everyone.  Somehow, even in the midst of everyone knowing everyone, there are always restaurants to share at these happenstance meetings.  For example, I had somehow never heard of Hanny's up until this point.  My friend assured me that I had to try it out.  I am so glad I did!  I went there the first time for lunch and was immediately enamored with the space.  The elements are mostly square and granite gray with a large square bar in the center of the first floor dining area.  The gray is not cold, but cool and inviting.  At the bar, they cut fresh prosciutto (which, though my pescatarian mouth will not be tasting it, I can still appreciate).  The food was filling and tasty.  A deliciously seasoned portabella mushroom sandwich and a Hanny's salad (served at an enormous portion) are my favorites.  The sandwiches come with onion crispies which is kind of a guilty pleasure.  An elevator as well as stairs lead up to the upstairs loft.  An old elevator shaft next to the functioning elevator (the building was build some time in the 1940s I believe) has been cleared out and glass installed so you can get quite an endless view which adds even more character and enjoyment to the place.  There is a second bar upstairs and more dining space.  HOWEVER, my favorite part of the upstairs are the bathrooms.  You walk through a narrowing mirrored passage into an oval shaped room.  You might not even notice that there are doors all around you, but the waitstaff has told you to \"push\" on one of the walls.  The whole room is paneled with while doors that at first glance just appear to be part of the wall.  Each is a separate bathroom (so gender neutral, which is great).  The whole upstairs is a bit like being Alice falling down the rabbit hole (in a good way).  Come here for a nice lunch or at night if you want to treat it fancy and get semi-dressed up (which the mood would certainly allow--I want to host a dinner here!).",

    "text": "You've got to give the place credit. It has personality. It has charm. It has a unique feature -- a nonworking elevator with a plexy glass floor and ceiling so that when an unsuspecting visitor is pushed in, they experience a moment of terror of plummeting to their death.   And, the kicker: Hanny's is said to be haunted (this according to the waitstaff).   I'm curious if/when you visit, you check out the bathrooms on the top floor.  The set up is kind of creepy and reminded me of a scene out of  \"The Shining\"...  Hanny's has a history. It use to be one of the original department stores in Phoenix. After it closed, the fire department used it for training drills.  You can still see the scorched walls in the elevator shaft.  With all this charm, I might consider overlooking the overpriced drinks. I ordered a martini, which came out in a tiny glass (maybe 4-5 oz ). The charge was $7.50,  I jokingly asked our server  if Hanny's put the \"teenie\" in \"Martini\"?  I thought it was funny, but the waiter didn't.   Moreover, I was left disappointed with the menu selection. It seemed dull and limited. But, as the waiter explained, Hanny's was developed as a wine bar and the limited menu was intentional. I just think with the great location and status, this place has so much more potential!   For an appetizer we ordered the Bruchetta -- which is mostly olives (as oppose to traditional tomato bruchetta). For dinner, I ordered the veggie pizza - which seemed flavorless.   They had two actual dinner specials which change daily/weekly and my husband seemed content and satisfied with his \"special.\"    I think Hanny's is a nice experience, but a little underwhelming if you are actually hungry.",

Anna was the highlight of the experience, but the food was amazing too! The venure is stunning, very modern yet comfortable. We will most definetly be going back to Hannys soon.

Not many bartenders make old fashioneds or singapore slings anymore, and I love the fact that they have a variety of old drinks, plus a huge list of good scotch and other spirits. It does bother me that some people, mainly hipster trash, will frequent this place and enjoy these drinks just for the fact that they're vintage, old, classic, aka hipster gold. Also, the food wasn't too compelling. I ordered a steak sandwich, and it was so so; the steak was a little too gristly to enjoy. The ambiance is definitely a hip, modern vibe; that can be good but not here.

Arrived and loved the ambiance - light music playing in the background.  The place was very hip and contemporary, but not 'unfriendly' ....had a good vibe to it.  Unfortunately for them, they weren't horribly busy.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  As we were commenting about the coolness of the place the music got a bit louder and then it turned WEIRD.... when the waitress stopped to take our drink order - i even asked 'is THAT music??'  to which she confirmed it was -  hummmm Don't worry - the music eventually turned into normal tunes suitable for dining and talking  : )   Drinks??  Oh my - they have quite a few interesting choices.  My date ordered the mojito - it was art in itself!  Beautiful and quite tasty! I had a wonderful glass (or two)  of the Leese Fitch Cabernet wine --mmmmm, it was very good!!    For starts we ordered the Bar Plate appetizer.  The prosciutto was great, melon was perfectly ripe, cheese, nuts were very good.  The olives were ok -noting special.  BTW - My wine went splendidly with everything on the plate, and in case you are wondering, the bar plate was perfect for two to share.    I will confess, we are 'trying' to eat lighter these days ...(arghhhh) so instead of trying several different things as my stomach was hoping,  we opted to split a pizza.   We ordered the veggie pizza and added chicken!  yah -- i hear ya - it's really no longer a 'veggie' pizza is it??   Anyhoo ...the pizza was FANTASTIC!!  it was perfectly cooked - i loved the crust and the veggies ...ohhh and the chicken too!  (like i said - it was a great pizza!) Oh and we polished off the whole pizza!!  Truly i really would have tried to steal a slice from my date, but he ate faster than i did!!   I think next time, i'll order more!    I did catch a glimpse of plates being served and the sandwiches look amazing as did the salads.  I'm looking forward to trying those too!!!  At the end of it all ..... i know i will definitely go there again. I wouldn't say you need to be 'dressed up' for Hanny's but you certainly wouldn't want to show up in gym clothes.   Like i had mentioned earlier, it wasn't too busy so i hope the word continues to get out and they stay in business.  It is such a great place for downtown dinning!!",

    "text": "Like a lot of other reviewers, I was excited about the concept of Hanny's when I first heard of it. We need more elegant dining options downtown, and the idea of operating such a restaurant inside this classic old department store sounds too irresistible. After eating lunch there with my spouse, I'd say that they succeeded, for the most part.  We arrived at about 12:30 on a Friday. The place was mostly deserted. In this case, it was OK since the staff performed extra attentively. All three of the women who served us were extremely nice and helpful. Honestly, I didn't get any of the haughtiness that other yelpers noticed in that department.  We both ordered pizzas. While waiting for our lunch, we explored the upstairs and the plexiglass covered elevator shaft. The bathroom area looked like something out of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Thankfully, they didn't totally gut what made the department store so unique. Pretty neat!   As the food arrived, I was surprised to find the pizzas are actually a good size for a filling meal. The food was perfectly prepared and priced fairly. Personally, I love thin crust pizza, and for that reason the meal did not disappoint. My partner even needed a doggie bag. We also had glasses of water served in \"piss elegant\" thin glasses, but at least the staff were attentive enough to give us plenty of refills.  What about the atmosphere? The dining room was beautifully appointed with leather and marble tabletops, but on the whole it seemed cold and echoey. Sometimes it felt like we were dining in a tomb. I imagine this place is a lot more inviting at night, with a full house.  All in all, it was a good but not thrilling dining experience. I would recommend that the curious at least give this place a try. The only complaint I have, like the others here, is the limited menu. Aside from pizza, they only serve 3 or 4 varieties of unexciting sandwiches and salads. It's the one thing that keeps me from giving Hanny's a four star rating. There IS some good news, however. Staffers told us that, starting tonight (5/22), they will be serving an expanded menu. The only deletion was a sandwich served on an English muffin that looked too expensive, anyway. It might be worth a re-visit for that reason alone.",

I love the music, decor, ambiance, food (my heart belongs to the cheese plate), the young hipster/trendy crowd and drinks. Even when it's crowded, you never feel ignored by the wait staff which is an extra plus!",
