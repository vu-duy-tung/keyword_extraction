More fruit, less sugar, and fresh made every morning on the premises. Get there early if you're a scone lover. The coffee is of course very good. Tea selection is even better with many varieties to choose from. A funky converted gas station with great service too!",

There are two huge couches in the middle of the seating area- which essentially makes it so there is less seating overall. I'm not sure about you- but it exceeded my comfort level to sit on a couch in the middle of two strangers. Also- the purple couch has A LOT of city miles on it. Might be time To retire it.",

    "text": "First off, the atmosphere is pretty cool. It has a laid-back and indie kind of vibe going on. Lots of interesting people drinking their coffee, some students, some people having conversation--it's all good. I'm not a person that is bothered by the background noise of a coffee house (in fact, the noise helps me focus), hence why I frequent them to study. So why the three-star rating?  Atmosphere aside, this place was a little odd. It kind of feels like a sideshow of sorts and coffee house awkwardly pieced together....  1. When I walked up to the display counter I checked out the various muffins and cookies (which are monstrous). I placed an order for a mocha and then asked the person upfront what one of the cookies were, as there was no label for them. She looked at them, looked surprised and said that she didn't know and would have to ask someone to find out. Then she stood there and stared at me. After a few seconds she asked me if I wanted something. \"Um.....yeah, I wanted to know what kind of cookie that is so I can figure out if I want to buy it...??\" Duh. Seriously? Are you not going to sell me the cookie? Am I crazy to expect that you'll ask someone next to you if you don't know? Strange.   2. The place was eerily quiet when I first sat. No music. No loud voices---people were basically quiet and doing their own thing, surprisingly. (usually there is that ONE loud person). But then something in the air stirred and this guy starts playing the trombone... okay, not bad (a little odd of an instrument choice, but I won't judge. Also, the jazzy music was pretty cool to study to.)...then another guy picks up a harmonica and mic....hmmm, interesting. Kind of folky, not bad....Annnddd then this guy starts singing and playing a guitar. Ok, seriously? Trombone, harmonica and guitar? And it seems like they are all playing three different songs. I pull up the coffee shop's website, nope, this little \"musical adventure\" is not listed on their calendar. So can random people play live music whenever or was I just privy to a special random performance? I mean it was around 4pm on a Sunday, so I wasn't expecting there to be any kind of live entertainment.   Also, the disjointed music has now become a distraction (see, I've lost all concentration to study and started writing this review instead ::sigh::).   3. Parking: there are like four parking spots? You have to park on the neighborhood side streets--not sure if there's a permit requirement or a free-for-all. So park at your own risk.   4. On the plus side, the mystery cookie was pretty tasty and the coffee wasn't bad. I got the lavender mocha, it didn't really have any lavender taste (maybe they forgot it?), but I liked that it wasn't overtly sweet or syrupy.   Overall, I'm not that impressed. If you're going to have live music--cool, just let your future patrons know through your website or some kind of sign. Also, your staff needs to get it together a little. They just seem like they're floating around, just hanging out behind the counter a little clueless.",

There was a period in 2011 to early 2012 where the service wasn't consistent and I stopped going for a while. However, I'm very glad I gave it another chance as the service has been PERFECT ever since (about mid 2012). Not being able to incorporate very much dairy in my diet, Copperstar is very accommodating, particularly with its almond milk option for drinks, as well as being flexible on substitutions on its meals. They also make a crazy good BLT that comes with pasta salad, chocolate chip cookies that make your heart melt, and a hummus plate that rivals anything Pita Jungle has. Great atmosphere, music is not your cliche hipster Starbucks style. They play a great variety, my personal favorite is when they play nineties music. Do yourself a favor and go! You won't regret it!",

The staff is super friendly, there is plenty of room to lounge around and play on the internet (for free). The menu is awesome! I don't have much of a sweet tooth but all their pastries look delicious. I think they switch up the art on the walls like every two weeks or something like that so it's nice to see all the different art work. On Sunday mornings theres this 3 piece band that comes in around 10:30 or 11:00 and plays old country and rock tunes.   I love how I stop in every morning before work and Cindy or any of the other ladies know exactly what I want.   If you live in the neighborhood and haven't been to Copper Star yet, you are blowing it.",

I got a ride here while my friend did a study group at ASU so I could give Lux a break and got down to laptopping and reading after buying a very good decaf soy latte. I settled down into my table and noticed the place didn't have a lot of buzz for a Friday during the day.   About two hours into my work, a woman came in for a book signing wearing an unironic fanny pack and I moved so she could have the table.  Then I moved to the sofa but was distracted by the perfectly coifed guy on the sofa wearing a silk button down shirt a la most graduation photos circa 1993 kept muttering to himself how to improve his writing quite theatrically.   I moved to another table when my laptop needed another boost from the outlet but then had a very harley davidson old man with what seemed like his granddaughter but looked like a runaway from Suicide Girls, pre-teen edition (she was wearing short shorts with thigh high socks and a big baggy sweatjacket-it was like 30 degrees out!) sat at the end while waiting for their orders to come though.  Finally, I ended up in the corner red chair to plug in again and my friend met up and we got another coffee and a snack. By that point, the place was starting to get packed and a family now at the table literally in front of me, the guy kept talking about his body-building competition, what he knew about computers, hooters (to which he talked about to his wife's PARENTS) forever forever forever forever....  We had to go after that and escaped to Lux.  The place itself is fine, the coffee and treats have been solid, but the people here are really distracting to me-therefore, it drops a star as a place to concentrate and do work.  Sorry! And I really hope that body building competition in two weeks gives you a chance to build some more bod to impress the waitresses at Hooters!",

But in my effort to drink more local coffee, and less of The Siren's, I have to add my oh-two.  I dig Copper Star -- good coffee, friendly crew, a drive through. Heck, one time, I even got a free Powerball ticket there.  I only have one quibble, and it's a small one. I only mention it because I care. It's the excessive and cheesy signage.  I liked the little hand-painted sandwich board, that read, \"drink local coffee.\" It fit perfectly with their local business vibe.  Now that sign has been repainted in a more generic manner, and moved to the side. In its stead is a gigantic white vinyl banner, on it, printed in stark, black, all caps \"DRIVE THRU COFFEE.\"  Gag.   So now there's the generic sandwich board, the huge banner, the flappy flags, and the neon in the window.   I understand that they are trying to increase business. But now it's looking like a used car lot, and reeks of desperation. People don't like to patronize desperate business, because it's sad, and makes them feel sad too.  Please, Copper Star, dial it down a notch. Share your message with confidence, but without shouting. We will still love you!  EDIT: OK I stopped by the very next day, and the \"DRIVE THRU COFFEE\" banner was replaced by a huge red banner with all caps white lettering that reads, \"SANDWICH KING OF 7TH AVE.\"  Ulgh.",

Apparently that wasn't enough.  So Copper Star brought in a string quartet. On a Monday night.  Seriously Copper Star? You're just going to step up and raise the bar like that on every coffee house in Phoenix? Bringing in a string quartet is an independent coffee house declaration of war. Copper Star is throwing down the homespun, hand-knitted fair trade alpaca gauntlet to every other bean brewer in Phoenix.   I'm impressed. I'll be back. Also, try the Thai Iced Tea.",

I wish I'd had a chance to relax on the shady patio--maybe next time.  The espresso (doppio, black) was very good--not burned like Starbucks, and fairly fruity.  I also had a couple of almond milk cappuccinos, which were also perfectly made.    For the first 2 days I stopped in, the most amazing cake was sitting on the baked goods case.  I met the woman (maybe the owner?  not sure) who does all of the baking, and she shared that she uses old-fashioned recipes.  It was very early and not cake hour for me, so I resisted, but wow.

Quite a lot of variety on the menu in regards to drinks, and surprisingly a lot of tasty food options-- last time I was in, my friend ordered the curry salad, which looked amazing!  Baked goods and lattes are very yummy as well, and (the fellow that I presume to be) the owner is such a hospitable and considerate human. Bonus points for being in a really lovely neighborhood and vintage shopping area, I quite enjoy introducing people or bringing out-of-town guests here for a sip and bite while perusing the nearby shops.",

It's different in that they don't have a menu posted and they come up to your car to take your order. I decided to try their ice brewed coffee and it is so smooth. No burnt, sour or acidic taste. I asked the barista to add some cream and agave for me, with no other direction and it was perfect - not overly sweet like most places.   I also ordered a cranberry-pecan scone because baked goods and coffee are meant to be consumed together. Uhm. The scone is bigger than my hand. Not that I have big hands, but still. It is a little on the drier side, but delicious! And as an added bonus, since it's my first visit, they bought my scone for me! Whaaaaat. If that's not amazing customer service, I don't know what is!   As an added bonus, they have punch cards. Loooove. Will def be back, sleeping baby in tow!",

The band plays for 2+ hours at deafening levels that make the inside of the place unusable. They take up all the soft seating and reduce the spaces for people to actually sit an enjoy a coffee and/or a conversation.   Will I come back? Of course I will. Will i be forced to go someplace else for my weekly Sunday escape? Sadly, yes, because their is no seating most Sundays and it is getting to hot to sit outside.",

    "text": "I decided to come here on a Saturday night because my bf and I had to do some work (I know, lame.)  The place was really hard to find as they have a small sign that doesn't really light up that much.  You have to understand.  I am from Las Vegas - bright lights on building galore so I was looking for something like that to jump at me, but luckily, the bf found it and we just parked on the curb. I bet that during the morning, it would be really hard to find parking.    So facing 7th Ave is the side of the building - but you think it's the front.  It's like an old gas pump area and you think, \"Huh..this looks weird\".  I get in and the place is completely unexpected - it was extremely inviting and the employees are super sweet.  I ordered an almond milk chai tea and honestly, it was not good.  I felt really bad, but I told them with my most sweetest voice possible, \"I don't mean to be a prick, but I don't like this.  Can I have something else?\"  The reaction was awesome!  They were so apologetic and was definitely willing to make me something else. The barista tells me that the almond milk is unsweetened so I had to settle for non-fat.  The problem is, I'm paleo so I kinda want the almond milk, but I realize that unsweetened is not so good.  However, the non-fat iced vanilla latte was good.  I didn't drink it all, but it was good.  So we strolled in around 9pm and the atmosphere was so relaxing.  Maybe it was the fact that there was not a $hit ton of people in the place, but I stayed there ten minutes before closing time.  If they didn't close, I probably could of stayed there longer.  So ambiance and service totally give it a 5, the limited coffee options, a 3.",

Starbucks WISHES it could be this place; they are most likely on their own hands and corporate knees praying, only to find them go unanswered. Lol. It wishes it was as cool, had as great a drink selection (not just coffee either-try the raspberry tea!!!), and has an inviting atmosphere that is great for hanging out and socializing.   Wait! Did you say socializing John? In a coffee house? In Phoenix of all places?   Yes. :) Believe it. Come here for their coffee. Stay for their great service.

It's a great place to meet up with a friend to play catch up, talk world events or even strategize. The art work is quit funky, too.  Aside from the great coffee, they make some pretty tasty sandwiches and salads. I really like the lemon ginger tuna salad sandwich because it's light and surprisingly filling and no-mayo. I prefer this vinaigrette based salad because really, who wants to bite into a mayonnaise sandwich?  It's also bike and dog friendly and they are really excitied about recycling.",

I ordered a large earl gray, and the super friendly guy behind the counter let me know that the kind of earl gray they offer is his favorite, and I was going to love it. He was totally right - it was delicious, and so was the house-made lemon cookie I had (which was on the house!) that a super friendly gal gave me with my tea. She also complimented my shirt, so needless to say if I could give this place 6 stars I would.   It's always a good feeling to be a patron at a locally owned spot, and I know if I was a Phoenix local I'd be a regular. Thanks for the tea and hospitality, Copper Star! :)",

No, I'm not the jerk who wants employees to be away from their loved ones to make me coffee, but a person desperately needing a jolt of caffeine before our Friendsgiving celebration.

Turns out the whole family works from 7-11 every Thanksgiving because the husband, \"Needs his fix.\" Of course I understand and am thankful for his addiction too!  Everyone was very friendly, Christmas music was playing and regulars stopped in for coffee and to pick up pre made Thanksgiving pies. The whole atmosphere made me happy and grateful.   Oh, and the lavender latte made with house made lavender syrup, awesome!  Stop in, you'll not regret it!",

Whenever I'm too lazy/late to make coffee at home, I leave it up to the staff at CS to start my day off right. OR If I know that my own coffee pot won't do the trick on any given day, this is where I go. The staff is unbelievably friendly, the coffee is made to the T, and their baked goods are always deliciously satisfying (not to mention, vegan-friendly if you're into that). Copper Star pays close attention to the quality of service and goods they provide, which is hard to ignore. There's more than one reason why I keep coming back here, and when you give this place a shot you'll see why.  Overall, Copper Star owns the coffee biz West of Central. There's no reason to go anywhere else.",

The owner offered me a free muffin on my first time visit because he did not recognize me has a regular customer.  I enjoy coming here from time to time to get work done and the regulars there are all very friendly. This is a great place to stop in for a meeting or if you just want to work at a cafe.  As someone who only drinks black coffee, I do not find their regular coffee very enjoyable. It often has a bland taste and comes out boiling hot. This normally would not be a issue, however, the cups do a poor job of insulating the coffee so the drink itself changes temperatures drastically over a short period of time. Hence, the three-star rating.",

I had looked for a local sandwich shop on yelp and was pleased to have  found this spot... hell, it was close enough, so we gave it a shot.  The buildling is an old gas station I've driven by many times before ... never would I have thought that it would be creatively converted into a small sandwich and coffee shop... but I'm glad it did!  The small outdoor patio had a few people there (and some pets) and the indoor seating area was small but empty enough that we found quick seating.  The table/chairs were a bit awkward (a bit wobbly), but we made do.  We all had sandwiches (I the Curried Chicken Sandwich - how have I not had this before, it was outstanding in flavor!! and my sister's whose sam'ich I also tried was the Deviled Egg - also delicious) and afterwards we decided that, with the unique selection of alternative-ingredient baked goods they had on display, we'd try a few out.    When we had first walked in, this girl's big, FAT delicious looking cinnamon roll had caught my eye.. and after lusting after it throughout my meal, I decided I'd go back to the walk-up counter and get us one to split... waa!  They were all out!  Bummer... BUT, we tried their spice cake and their danish and they were excellent.  I will be back again for sure!",

That sort of friendliness and service is what many places lack!!! This place has the potential to be great.  I liked the music variety overhead, and the variety of small and large tables. And, of course, the staff was super chill, which is always a good thing.  The downsides: it had a funky smell.  I am not sure if it was the open kitchen concept - but it wasn't a familiar or the most pleasant smell.  Unfortunately, one of the coffee house guests was singing to himself (he has every right to! and this isn't the coffee houses job to tell him otherwise!), but it just disrupted my steady study mode... I will add that their restroom was not horrible, but it also wasn't as neat as I usually like to tolerate - it could use some fixin' up.  However, it's cool. The lavender mocha was more legit than I expected (I have never had a lavender drink in my life), and their baked goods looked amazing - try the no-bake cookie (but share it with a friend!)",

Overall my satisfaction is guaranteed at this place. There have been a couple of times where my chai tea has been too milky but the baristas are friendly and always willing to help in any way. Beware of their baked goodies! I've accidentally ate the entire monstrous thing unintentionally! So yummy!",

The latte was excellent - great taste, perfect amount of chai spice, and good mixture of soy.   The sandwich was great - fluffy bagel, great taste (didn't need hot sauce) and now overt greasy.    Service was excellent.  Real people with a smiling face is one of my favorite things to accompany my coffee.    Cool place to hang and grab a quick coffee",

They have free water you can help yourself to and free Wi-Fi.  It can get crowded in the mornings, I was there before 8:30am on a Wednesday and it was a little empty but soon filled up quick with large groups so really wasn't enough space for people wanting to work on laptops afterwards.  I enjoyed the vibe of the place and the espresso so would definitely return if I am in the area again.",

Relaxing, comfortable atmosphere - attracts a mature crowd - which I like. College kids are in the minority - which is great! And, finally, the staff is super nice and attentive - something missing from 80% of all shops.",

I was met with smiling faces and great conversation all around. I had a fantastic iced vanilla latte and enjoyed the misters outside on the patio. I realized I had forgotten my brother's apartment keys and had to wait for my brother for almost an hour after the dog's claw trim  so I sat outside with Otis and this gentleman who works here came outside and because it was hot, I troubled him for some water for Otis and without hesitation, he not only brought out a water bowl for Otis, but, he also brought out a cup of ice water for me!  He was so nice, wonderful and personable! After a short conversation, turns out he is the Owner of this place! His name is Bill and I am eternally grateful for his kindness and amazing personality! Thank you for making Otis and I feel welcome and comfortable! My brother, Otis and I will be back!  Thank you!",

I ordered an 8 oz. latte and I'm never expecting latte art, but this was just a pale mess with no texture to the milk. I could have ordered a double shot and poured in my own bland milk. If we're paying up to $4, there should be a little expertise with the frother.  She pushed it toward me with a sheepish look and a shrug like she knew it was crap but what's a gal to do when the boss says it's my turn to work the machine?  I watched her make another latte, this one extra large, and she frothed milk 3 separate times to get enough to fill the cup and it was clear she was frustrated with her own disorganization and made the same 'Hope this is gonna be ok' shrug when handing off to the customer.  The boss was getting mad at the workers in general for being slow and disorganized but was not paying attention to the crap drinks being made.  Having said all that, love this place. Great food and vibes, super friendly staff, cool manager/owner.",

I love how charming the cafe was, totally retro and it being an old gas station with a functioning drive thru. Taking a peek at the menu, they serve coffee and tea, pastries as well as food items. The gal who took my order was absolutely sweet and gave me recommendations, although I had my eyes set on the Lavender Mocha, she suggested it with white chocolate and so it was. I also wanted a bite to eat and settled for the Blueberry tart, which she so kindly gave it to me on the house for being a first timer. If that isn't hospitality, I don't know what is!  My Lavender Mocha was delicious iced, good lavender flavor without being too soapy and perfectly sweet with a good caffeine buzz. The white chocolate recommendation was great! The Blueberry tart was amazing, one of the best fruit tarts I've had in a while. The crust was so buttery and crumbly with the blueberry compote naturally sweet and a perfect proportion with the crust.  The atmosphere is great for studying and working, as there are tons of seating ranging from bar, table and sofa. Outlets available along the wall for those using their laptops. Huge windows, garage doors, really let in the natural light and let you admire the outdoors in the AC filled cafe.   Loved the service here, the environment and quality of coffee and pastries. Two thumbs up and definitely going to be back to try more of their awesome and yummy looking pastries and drinks! Only docking a star, maybe 1/2 a star, for the large amounts of flies in the shop and the fact I got bit by two mosquitos sitting in the back corner of the cafe. NBD.",

Right, back on track, the coffee -- today I got a cold brew -- and you know  good cold brew (for me anyway) only requires a little bit of cream, or dairy of choice, for it to perfectly balance and they hit it SPOT ON.  The baristas were so relaxed {coffee shop vibes} and quick. My fellow coffee consumers were either studying, relaxing and listening to the music or outside socializing.  There was no rush from anyone..it was perfect.  For the people looking for the perfect place to socialize without a hustle bustle of traffic or people, this is your gem.   //cheers//",

I have never felt unwelcome here or as though I'm overstaying. It's just the kind of small local business that you feel good patronizing and that leaves you with a smile.

The woman taking our order seemed so annoyed that we were bothering her! Didn't say hello, didn't ask us what we'd like, just stood there staring off waiting for us to speak. I asked how sweet the Lavender Mocha was and responded in such a snippy tone. I was really almost embarrassed for asking a question about their coffee. But, I got the Lavender Mocha and he got an Iced Caramel Coffee and both were made really well. It was definitely busy and everyone seemed to be enjoying their experience",

The design and overall feel of the interior is wonderful.  Especially now that the weather is getting cooler, I loved sitting inside next to the large open door, enjoying a lovely day.  I was there for a few hours working on my laptop, and I enjoyed that the people around me were a break from the normal \"coffee shop crowd.\" Speaking of the coffee shop crowd, the employees here are nicer than any barista, anywhere.  Seriously.  They greet everyone with a smile, and take your beverage order without judgement (how refreshing!) while willing to give recommendations if you need a little guidance.  But the thing that really pushed it over the top for me is the baked goods.  OH.  MY. GOSH.  This morning I stopped in to get a muffin on my way to work and half an hour later, when I finally got a chance to eat it (still warm!!), I literally walked around telling half my coworkers about this muffin.  It was that good.  Thank you copper star, for becoming my new regular coffee shop.",

    "text": "I am a neighborhood local, and regretfully cave in to going to Copper Star to get coffee when Im too lazy to make it myself.    Product: EVERYTIME i order their drip coffee, I immediately regret it.  Burnt, gritty, and occasionally tastes like it was reheated leftovers from the day before.  \"Iced Coffee\" at Copper Star consists of ACTUAL leftover coffee...  instead of tossing the leftover coffee when it's time to make a fresh pot, the coffee is put into metal containers and submerged in cold water and put in the refrigerator, then served  to customers the next day.  If you have in-house pastry people and a staff who has a clue what they're doing (too much to ask...?) i would expect fresh strong-brew that is immediately chilled, or for the progressive local spot, a proper overnight cold-brew.  No organic or fair trade coffee is advertised or offered, and no one has ever been able to tell me where it comes from.   I give this review 2 stars because they have great bagels.  From somewhere else.  How do you screw up bagels? They don't.  Thank you for putting my butter or cream cheese on yourself while my bagel is still warm.  This is what keeps me coming back...lol  However, they are regularly out of bagels by 9am.  Perhaps ordering more would solve this problem?  Or would that just be common sense? As I sit here today eating my bagel replacement (a Banana Nut Muffin), I was compelled to write this review when I discovered half of the browned banana in the bottom of my muffin.  The last one i had about a month ago had a small piece, so it didn't phase me.  I considered if the muffin was meant to have half a banana in the bottom, but then I'd never had one like that, and i certainly take the extra effort when making my own banana bread to carefully smash the banana before i add it to my batter BEFORE baking!  Staff:  If someone frequents a place at least once a week, they would expect some level of recognition, particularly if they are unique looking or have enigmatic personality.  I consider myself VERY unique looking.  The same staff looks at me like I have a second head growing outta my shoulders, or they seem dazed and robotic, with a Stepford Wife unprompted expectation of an order to be rattled off without greeting.  My mate used to work there, and no one seems to every recognize them, either.  I think it's weird.   Speaking of weird, let's chat about Bill.  There is another blocked review referring him: \"The owner (who I have met about 8 times now-- his name is 'Bill') is completely used-car sleazy and gives me the closeted creeper horrors. I sat at the bar for about a month working on my computer-- listening to how he talks to his mainly young-lady employees. His tone and the things he says range from offensive to condescending and inappropriate. Funny thing about having a completely open workspace-- the customers can hear everything you say...\" I have the same experience with him and have been appalled at the blatant sex-oriented comments said in full company of customers...  I wonder what Bill's wife thinks of his ladies at the the coffee shop.    Customer service starts with a smile, and listening skills.  If you would be busy LISTENING to what i want, instead of busy cutting me off with \"is that all...?\" you might actually get my order right, thus getting me out of your line and out of your life in the fasted way possible, which is clearly the intention of the bitchy girls who work there.    In short~ Local businesses fail because they don't appreciate the people supporting them.   Bill's favorites get away with murder and treat everyone like lesser folk.   Not every idea is a good one, especially ones regarding serving old coffee. Mash the bananas before adding them to the batter, and order some more friggin' bagels.    why do i continue to come here...?  I'm going to The Refuge next time.",

The variety of hot teas they offer is rather good, as is their hot drip coffee. If you ever get the chance to try their peach blackberry muffin, please do so. It's unlike any muffin I've ever had before. The only downside is parking. They have a parking lot with two spaces plus one handicap space. If you're driving, you're most likely going to have to park on the street or in the neighboring boutique's parking lot (and I don't think they like it when you do that.)",

Stone floors and brick walls mean a nice cool escape from the insane heat we all live in and the guys behind the counter actually seemed like they were happy to be at work. I even like the building itself, which appears to be converted from a 50's gas station with a single serving pump which now serves as the drive-through.

It was rather large and well priced, definitely a two person muffin. Unfortunately, I didn't really care for the mocha. It just didn't taste very smooth; I had it iced, perhaps it's better hot? I asked to have a replacement drink, which the barista was glad to do. I ordered an iced coffee with cream, and because of the price difference, I was given a chocolate chip cookie. Again, unfortunately, the coffee was pretty weak, and there wasn't enough ice to make it a cold drink, so it was a watery, lukewarm cup. Which was strange since I'm pretty sure the coffee came from a pitcher from the fridge. So, three stars for the terrific muffin, but I probably won't be going back for more.",

    "text": "Really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place - it's an old gas station remodeled into a hipster-ish coffee shop. There is a great variety of drinks, and different kinds of teas to choose from (which can be made both hot and iced), and plenty of seating both inside and outside. The walls are decorated with various art for sale and the entire place has a very \"urban-hip\" feel to it. The outside also has a nice small patio nestled between some trees and bushes, making it inviting to sit in. They also have a small variety of fresh pastries to choose from. Employees have been friendly the times I've been here as well. Only negative I'd have is that they do not really seem to have any dedicated parking - just one or two spots and handicap spots, so you have to look on the street.",

The food/drinks here are really good, and well priced! All 3 items I sampled (especially the hummus plate) were delicious. Free pastry for 1st timers too :-)  ONLY downside is since the place is small and everything is cooked right there, your clothes/belongings will stongly smell of a bacon(from their popular BLT)/ coffee mix for a while! Will have to do laundry each time, but will certainly be returning!",

My biggest thing though is that the staff/customer service is very hit or miss. Sometimes they are very friendly and pleasant. Other times they just stare at you and wait for you to say what you want. Today however they were really rude and literally slammed their hand on the counter when my mom politely asked if her iced tea was coming, which was taking an unreasonable time to get. The behavior was very uncalled for, obnoxious, unwarranted, and off putting. It made me sad to see, since I'm a regular and like to shop local, but think I'll go to starbucks next time.",

I was mesmerized as soon as I walked through the front doors because of all the character they were able to put into a small coffee shop and how everything was so inviting and cozy! When I calmed myself and gathered all the joy I had just acquired, I was welcomed in with a big smile from one of the employees and then (probably based off of the astonished look on my face) I was asked if this was my first time in. I then said yes, and they told me that since it was my first time in, I get a FREE pastry(!!!). I was on cloud nine by that point. Copper Star is a very sweet little hole in the wall coffee shop that has earned my love and a new loyal customer. Their prices are reasonable, and the tea is fantastic. They also have free WiFi, so as a college student, that is an absolute make or break for me when it comes to coffee shops. I highly recommend Copper Star to any and everyone who is looking for a quality coffee shop.   P.S. They have a drive through for all of you that are on the go, but still need a good pick me up!",

Barista adds a few pumps of syrup and then stirs the customer's drink--a drink the customer's already tasted--with the spoon she is using to prepare fresh drinks, then puts the spoon back in a pitcher with the others used to prepare fresh drinks. Am I too fastidious in demanding basic hygienic standards in restaurants? I mean, this isn't someone's home kitchen. When I worked in food service something like that would be a reaming from the manager, at the very least. Jeez. Hopefully this kind of thing isn't universal among the employees here.

    "text": "I'm originally from Phoenix's Encanto District. Whenever I'm back in town visiting my parents, it's a pleasure to come back to Copper Star Coffee.  Part of the reason to head to Copper Star is the ambiance: it's a converted vintage gas station with a quirky, welcoming feel. Light streams in through the glass-paneled garage door and, with the cafe's tall ceilings, the space feels at once very large and very cozy. I've come here to work in the past, but unlike some coffee shops, Copper Star is never completely overrun by laptops. There are always pairs or groups of friends here having a good time. Nevertheless, if productivity is what you want, the shop is never too loud, there's free WiFi, and there are a couple plugs along the west wall. I've definitely had some productive afternoons tinkering away at one of their long communal tables.   The quality of service at Copper Star has consistently been excellent. The folks are nice, approachable, and ready to help, and interacting with them has always been a joy. The coffee is good -- I'm a no-fuss, black coffee girl, but trust them about the iced cappuccino on really hot days -- and, if you're more of a tea person, they're one of the few places nearby that stock Harney & Sons, one of my favorite tea blenders in the US. I've had a couple pastries and the veggie sandwich, and they were delicious.  In sum: If you're a Phoenician in need of a charming, quality coffee shop in your neighborhood to spend time with friends or solo, go to Copper Star.  You're welcome.",

I loved all their different seating, the vintage cash register and even one of the coolest bathrooms I've ever been in, but if I'm going to pay nearly $5 for a 16oz drink, I want it to taste amazing. Was also disappointed that they didn't have any real selection in the bakery case - it was all sandwiches, breads, and a tarte (which looked good but was also overpriced).

Even better Customer service! Officially one of my favorite places!",

When you can find parking (though I prefer walking or biking), the atmosphere there is so relaxed you can't help but sit and unwind for a few.  Their non-coffee items are just as delicious, from the italian sodas (with choice of regular or heavy cream) to the delicious desserts and baked goods (which usually even have a vegan option), keep me coming back.   Parking is limited, and I've never been through the drive though as it looks awkward, but this is still a place you don't want to miss out on.",

Today we also indulged in a BLT and a vanilla cupcake with raspberry cream cheese frosting.  My favorite beverage so far is the cubano.  I love the amount of foam and flavor in the foam.  They leave the lid off of your drink and make a beautiful design in the foam.  I never really order a BLT, but I'm so glad I did!  The bacon is quality.  It's thick and meaty.  I would have liked a little less mayo, but nonetheless tasty.  The cupcake was beautiful to look at.  The cake was pretty plain, but was vanilla after all.  The raspberry cream cheese frosting made the cupcake.  All of the employees were friendly and cheerful.  My husband and I sat at the bar.  We were in awe as we watched the barista operate like a machine to make all of the drinks.  Even though they were fairly busy, the level of service never faultered.",

I keep wanting to love Copper Star for many reasons, but just can't get over that one major issue I have each time.  Upon giving Copper Star another shot, met with the same results we were.  I guess it should be a hint when a coffee shop gets awarded Best of Phoenix for their muffins and baked goods, but never a mention about the coffee?  That's kind of how it feels here.  The baked goods are quite good.  The cupcakes and muffins are very fresh, almost shockingly.  The place itself is quaint, delightful and has a very neat look - great idea with the gas station theme.  Coffee itself though, I could do without.  Automatic pulled shots that were well over 40 seconds.  Cappuccino that wavered between watery and milky, to a faint, faint background of burnt-roast-taste.  CSC is probably one of the better places to get a baked good in town.  If coffee is really your thing though, head east a half mile.",

The people working here are not too personable when talking with customers. I understand they might get tired of doing that for 5 hours, but if their friends come in leaning and hanging out on the counter while talking to the employees for half hour or more. Then it's time to get re-train some of these workers to be more customer oriented because they're losing focus. They're talking loud on the phone while on shift - pretty much everyone in the place could hear her business.  The coffee was \"ok\" nothing too special - I like that bitter/sweet taste in my drink, but that wasn't present.   The custom art on the walls are neat and makes the atmosphere of the place more welcoming, but there's a disconnect between that and the worker's attitude. I wouldn't mind coming back to this place and giving them another try... I'll re-review until then.",

We stopped by earlier this week for Yelp office hours (thanks again, Gabi, for organizing) and got an iced latte. It was good, but what really impressed me about this place is that it's in an old converted gas station! I just think that is so fun and cool, and it adds so much to the place's charm. I didn't get to try any of the pastries or sandwiches, and I'd love to come back to try the peach latte that Sofia L raves about, for now, I'll just say that this is a local business with good espresso and friendly staff that's in an old gas station - how cool is that?!",

For a laptop-wielding downtown resident like myself, outlet accessibility is as important as wifi and this place gets the thumbs up. The owner and staff are very friendly. They seem genuinely delighted to see every customer walk in. The place is fairly packed and I recognize the faces of at least two fellow downtown professionals as I sit here. The coffee is good. The scones are excellent. The ambiance reflects exactly what I look forward to as the future of downtown Phoenix:  scaled down, unpretentious but urban; loft-like bricks and open ductwork. Given its proximity to my home, I'll probably spend many weeknights here when I have late projects.",

I went in and instantly started to feel better.  It's so cool in there.  And the chairs are so plush and inviting.    I got a caramel iced coffee and a chocolate cupcake with sprinkles.

The owner was very nice in giving me an extra stamp on the \"punch\" card for my first visit.  I am a big fan of being rewarded for my loyalty so after 9 drinks (from apple juice to plain ole \"drip\") you get a 10th free (and we're talking lattes!)... There is a diverse quiet crowd here, and everyone pretty much keeps to themselves in a good way.  The music was not over the top, but current and enjoyable.   The shabby art on the walls is kind of fun to look at while they are steaming up that extra foam. I've sat outside both times and have been inspired to do a little after coffee antiquing, although I have yet to venture off of the patio with my latte. All in all, A+, great coffee, delicious strawberry cupcakes, good people, chill atmosphere..",

I just love their place, the former gas station turned coffeehouse makes this place as one of the places i bring out of town guests to show them that Phoenix does have its little gems and 7th ave or \"melrose\" is just quaint. Anywho, I've had good chai here, and yummy creamy nonfat vanilla lattes but only recently did I try a pastry treat. The lady behind the counter was a sweetheart and she made me feel extra special when she liked my \"human\" shirt and asked who designed it... yes that day i was proud to be a Gay Black Woman... as my shirt starts off with. I bought myself the nonfat vanilla latte with carrot cake cupcake that had what seemed was an extra dollop of cream cheese frosting, DeLISH! it was truly carrotrific, and the cupcake provided a great sweetness kick to go with my extra caffeinated beverage. Copper Star may not be a Lux with it's urban chic interior, or the real bohemian interior of Lola on Roosevelt or the hipster cool of Cartel in Tempe, no, Copper Star is simply cool with its venue and hold its own with its great drinks, coffees and treats, so hence Copper Star is truly a coffeehouse star!",

The peppermint / white mocha iced coffee was a bit strong at first, but I asked them to remake it and they did and it was wayyy better because I like my coffee sweet. The plates for the pastries are also super cute and unique.",

Definitely a unique place to hang with friends and enjoy a cup of great coffee!",

I loved those big hunky scones with chocolate chips. So now I'm scone free.  That doesn't mean I'm muffin, bagel, cookie, cinnamon roll, or brownie free though. :-)  #Freethescones",

I also had a piece of banana nut bread which was delicious...and HUGE! Easily 2.5, size of Starbucks and 100% tastier.   This place should definitely warrant a visit or ten.

Baristas were very friendly and when they guessed it was my first time visiting their shop, I said I was from out of town, they offered me a free pastry! I chose the pepper bacon scone. Strong flavors of pepper, bacon and butter, was so delicious! The middle was moist/soft and the outer edges were more dry like a regular scone. It was SO good! For coffee I got an iced americano. Sat outside on the patio and enjoyed my meal! The only downside is that the inside of the coffee shop felt very humid, but is tolerable.",

For the good coffee and great service, we would make sure to tip well with cash into their tip jar when getting a refill.   On the last day of our trip, right before our flight home, I was reviewing our expenses for the trip and noticed a discrepancy between some of our coffee receipts and bank charges. Apparently, even though we tipped in cash, and selected no tip on the machine during the credit card purchase we had been charged $2.00 extra for tip on at least 2 transactions.   Sure, it's only $4. But this is an incredibly dishonest business practice and I would have confronted the owner of the store about it if we were staying any longer in Phoenix.",

Copper Star currently operates out of an old building that was once a gas station. Business building conversions are, from what I've read, a written legal requirement for True hipster credibility. The place has a bit of charm, I'll admit.  I ordered an iced mocha tuxedo and my girlfriend ordered an iced cubano. Both were good for what they were. Your fairly straightforward anti-corporate coffee, I guess. Maybe if there already weren't so many local coffee shops, I'd be a bit more enthusiastic. Since it was National Cookie Day, we used it as an excuse to order both a gingerbread and chocolate chip cookie. Both were decent.   While I would never go out of my way to come here, I'm sure it's a great little hang-out spot for people who live in the area.",

It was closer to a smoothie than I expected, but so delicious.  I also got a cheesecake muffin, a hummus plate and some bagel egg sandwiches. It was all very reasonably priced. The hummus plate had all sorts of goodies to go with the homemade hummus. The ingredients used were all high quality. The muffin was most and fluffy.",

No one ever asked my name so I asked a woman working there how do I get my order. She very shortly said it'll be coming. I asked if I could get my iced tea first and she slammed her hand down on the counter and said very nastily we have many kinds of teas. I'm 61 and have never had this bad an experience. No matter how busy you are, if you can't treat customers professionally and cordially, maybe you need a different job.",

The coffee is AMAZING and I had a chocolate coconut scone that was super yummy! I love the vibe this coffee spot has and the employees were great! I had mentioned to the cashier that it was my first time here and she gave me my scone for free! Such a nice gesture especially when I was only planning on grabbing a coffee with plans to study! I got a 16 oz iced Tuxedo with almond milk.  I LOVE that they have alternative options to milk. She warned me that if I was vegan the powder in the tuxedo wasn't all vegan which I appreciated because if I was vegan I would want to know that.  Overall awesome experience and cool retro with a modern twist coffee shop vibe!! I just heard someone order a breakfast sandwich I definitely will have to try one next time! They have punch cards and they have a drive thru! Even though I really would recommend stepping inside and taking a look around!",

There are some endearing quirks to the place as well. The occasional jazz band playing there in the mornings and mid afternoons is a nice touch.  As a note: if you're ordering an iced beverage, the choices are medium/large/extra large, which can be a bit confusing at first, especially for those of us who need caffeine to function. You adapt.  My one knock against the place would be to say that the geometry is awkward, at best. No truly clear place for the line to queue. The seating can be tricky if you want to be solo but not sit at the coffee bar. The patio is nice, but it can be trick to find a place to sit. There's street parking to be had, but you might have to park a block or so away (I personally don't mind the walk, but I can understand how it could get annoying in July).  Overall, a solid cafe, and my go-to in this part of Phoenix.",

The place is so cute- chic, trendy, neat eclectic decor that is so in right now. Staff are equally eclectic, laid back and downright adorable.  Unfortunately, the coffee sucks. Extremely acidic and fruity- just not my style at all, and I'm a Starbucks-everyday kinda girl. I also tried the blackberry-peach muffin and the cashew-white chocolate cookie, and both were over-baked- very dry. Tasty, yes. Yummy, no.  I was there with a friend who ordered a Thai iced tea, which was mostly milk. After drinking almost half, she went up to the counter to ask for more tea, expecting to pay the 50-cent refill charge. They took her dollar bill, did not apologize for the weak drink and gave her no change.  I'd like to say I'll be back, but I won't, not after 3 disappointing visits.  I want to support local businesses- but I can't force down stuff that doesn't taste good. :(",

The staff is wonderfully friendly, the coffee is great, the loose leaf teas are very well curated to offer a nice variety of caf and decaf options without being overwhelming, and their iced tea selection has a black, herbal and fruited option. Their food menu is the perfect mix of limited and diverse (though I would not say this is a place to go for food), and they have a wide variety of baked goods that they rotate on a regular basis.  On top of that? They have handmade craft-y things if you want to impulse buy a gift and a rotating display of artwork on the walls. They do it all, and they don't mess it up.  This place. Everything about this place. My only concern is that it will one day get too crowded for its cozy floor plan!!  P.S. The bathrooms are always clean. Not regular restaurant clean, but the type of clean that's worth mentioning in a review of the place. And the sink fixture is really pretty!",

They have very good ice coffee and drip with good cappuccinos as well. One of there best things is there baked goods, which are freshly made in-house every morning. (On your first visit they will give you any baked item for free). They have only a few food items, (bagel sandwich, vegan plate, curry salad/ wrap, hummus plate) but they are also all made in-house and very delicious. All prices are very reasonable.

    "text": "\"Buy Local Coffee\" is what a sign out front of this establishment says.  So that's what I did.  I went to Copper Star Coffee to get my drink of choice, an iced coffee with cream.  I enjoyed the flavor.  It was better than Starbucks and quite a few cents cheaper.  SCORE!!!  I became a regular.  I stuck with my ice coffee for months but their bakecase was calling my name every time I would enter.  I found out Copper Star bakes their own pastries fresh daily.  Another SCORE!!!  No preservatives or high fructose corn syrup.  I started adding a scone with my iced coffee.  They have chocolate chip, lemon, blueberry, etc.  Delicious!!!  The apple sauce spice cake is now my favorite.  It is a vegan pastry.  It is flavorful and the glaze is so slight but fantastic.  Not a vegan by the way.    I have been slowly branching out among the Copper Star menu.  Try the Black Cherry Limeade.  The specialty coffee drinks are quite good too.  The blended toffee drink rocks.  The antioxidant smoothie is refreshing.  The other smoothies are okay.  They use syrup in those.  I don't know how healthy that makes them.  (Real fruit please).  Let's talk about their sandwiches now shall we.  I have tried their sesame tuna, the curry chicken, the deviled egg salad, and the veggie.  All of them are winners.  You wont be disappointed.  Copper Star just unveiled there new sub sandwiches as well.  They use a local butcher's sausages for their subs.  Awesome.  Way to keep it in the community.  -internet access -community board -art work -misters for the heat -water bowl for dogs -drive thru car hop service -frequent customer stamp card  The Copper Star building is an old service station cleverly gutted out and made super cool.  The staff is great and they stick around.  Not a high turn over.  It must be a great place to work.  Parking can be tricky.  The majority of the parking is on the street and the parked customer cars creep into the surrounding neighborhood.  You may have a little walk.  Big Woop!  A must.  Check it out.",

    "text": "Is it possible to have a crush on a coffeeshop?  This place is, by far, my favorite new discovery in ages.  I've been driving past it on my way to and from work for ages but never had the time to stop in.  I have friends who rave about the place and go regularly, so I really wanted to check it out.  I finally did this past Saturday (5/31) and I scolded myself for not having done so sooner.  My friend and I found a parking space out back in the tiny parking lot and walked in not really knowing what to expect.  One patron sat at a table with her laptop and the rest of the place was empty.  The friendly girl at the counter took our orders and gave her own recommendations for cool drinks.  I took her up on her suggestion of a peach smoothie.  It was wonderful - like drinking pureed peaches!  I took a sip of my friend's latte and knew I would be ordering one of my own at some point in the near future.  Before taking our drinks, my eyes lingered over the cupcakes on display; I must admit I drooled a bit.  Because it was such a nice night, we sat outside and enjoyed our drinks.  It wasn't long before more people showed up.  A group of older folks joined us outside and a few other groups and couple settled inside.  My mind kept going back to the cupcakes I saw earlier, and I ended up going inside to buy one.  My choices were vanilla, red velvet, lemon, and strawberry (I think).  Not only were the cupcakes quite sizeable, but they had sprinkles - goldfish and piggies!  Very nice touch.  I ended up selecting a vanilla funfetti cupcake with bright blue icing and goldfish sprinkles.  It wasn't anything spectacular - just a cupcake made from a box cake mix - but it was a very nice treat and that much more special due to the fishies.  I know - it doesn't take much to make me happy.  I've since been back twice and have used the very convenient drive-thru.  The first time, the man who came out to greet me asked if I had my stamp card after he took my order.  When I told him I didn't, he told me he would give me one, and he did - along with three stamps!  that morning I had another peach smoothie and decided to try the red velvet cupcake.  The smoothie was just as ood as the first, but this cupcake was VERY tasty - much better than the vanilla funfetti.  I stopped again this morning and ordered a vanilla latte.  That sucker far surpassed the vanilla lattes I usually get at Starbucks.  I love supporting local businesses, and I'm only too happy to return to Copper Star time and again.  I suggest you do, too!",

Comfy couches, hip artwork, tons of music that is on my ipod playlist anyhow, I love this place.  I had possibly the best tuna fish sandwich that I have ever had in my life. Lemon ginger something or another...devine. Also iced green tea as I was feeling a bit ill and in need of rehydration. Hit the spot and has free refills all day. I would also reccomend the baked goods, as they are fresh baked and completely sinfully , irresistable  The service is friendly and efficent just as I remember it. Anytime I have been here I was treated kindly, politely, and rather like a friend.   This is one of my favorite spots in the valley and when I retire at short bursts I try to visit daily.",

The tiny patio is nice for cooler weather or enjoying the day with your canine companion. Be warned, it fills up fast with only two tables.  ETA: Chocolate chip cookies have recently been added to the baked goods line- up, and man- are they amazing.",

I barely had to add any milk or sugar.  Such a small space with hardly any parking whatsoever. Inside, very little options when sitting. No, I don't want to sit on a wooden chair for over 2 hours, thanks. Wish this place had more plush seats.   Decor is cool and relaxing. Really liked the layout and I found the bathroom to be even cool. Go fig. Service was prompt and friendly.   I'd go back, yes. But only to grab and run - maybe even do the drive-thru thing. Doubt I could find an open seat inside (or a parking spot outside), so why bother?",

The pastries are really good, but I wish they had more of a selection of Apple filled croissants in the afternoon, although the cupcakes look good, but as Frank Zappa said- \"Some people prefer cupcakes. I, for one, care less for them.\"   Yeah, it's also a converted gas station, but aesthetics aside, this place is a great chill out spot for my Sunday ritual of actually relaxing from the work week. Check out the community board as well, it's nice to see what's going on around the Melrose/ Coronado/ Downtown community.  Enjoy",

Everything you could want in a coffee shop.  But that's not all...  When you buy your coffee from a big soulless company, *cough* Starbucks *cough*, you not only experience an inferior product, but you transfer local resources, your money, out of the state.  By supporting local businesses you promote competition, keep the money circulating in our community, and foster a more connected society.... That being said I am a quality monger and if Starbucks ever actually makes coffee/espresso that is the best, I will eat my words with a nice dry cappuccino.

That said, I have to confess: I've never actually had coffee here. You see, I'm a Trader Joe's gal. I buy my Trader Joe's roast [well, actually Ken buys it, I don't do grocery shopping any more], bring it home, set up the timed Mr. Coffee [well, actually Ken does that for me too--don't all you chicks out there wish you had MY husband???] and it turns on at 6 am. By the time I'm done with my health walk, it's brewed and waiting for me.  So you all are no doubt wondering just why is this crazy NDN woman reviewing a coffee shop where she's never had the coffee? Because, amigos...it's because Coffee Star is one of my favorite lunch spots. It's in the Melrose District, also one of my faves [I have a biggg article coming out in Valley Guide Quarterly to prove it!], their sandwiches are OK [not 100 percent, more like 80 percent but that's ok], the building is just the coolest old gas station-cum-coffee shop EVER and did this, kemosabes...  THEY HAVE REAL COKE!! That's right, caballeros, they have Mexican Coca-Cola, the old recipe with real sugar instead of the corn syrup that Coke so-calls sweetens their colas with. That along is worth driving over for...  And it's a great spot to hang and watch the world go by. One of these days I'll try out the wi-fi and try to resolve that issue....",

The times that I do go to coffee shops is when I want to buckle down and get some work done for my graduate classes or lesson plan for work.  For very obvious reasons, the free WIFI is KEY when I want to spend hours at a coffee shop getting work done.  I've been to Copper Star a few times, and noticed that their Internet is very slow.  This past Saturday, however, it was beyond frustrating.  I asked the girl working the counter and she replied \"Our Internet is sucky.\"  Needless to say, a pretty pathetic and frustrating response.  I had already ordered a tea and breakfast sandwich (nothing special there) so I had to stick around to finish those up.  The Internet (after a half hour) starting working but went in and out.    Coffee shops without consistently working WIFI are useless to me, and despite how adorable the actual spot is, I don't see myself returning here again.  If you need reliable Internet, I don't think you should, either (unless they fix the problem).",

Also offering an array of specialty teas and fruit smooties, Copper Star is most notable in my book for their fresh, in house baked goods. I highly reccomend trying one of their frosted cupcakes...scruptious! In a hurry? Call in your order for pick up or use their drive-thru! Free wifi for customer use as well as long couches and lots of natural light, Copper Star is not too big, not too small, and perfect for those who want a mellow, non-pretentious, smoke-free place to drink coffee.   One gripe: I do not reccomend their Chai tea lattes-- they seem too sweet for some reason.   I do however, love their mochas and their antioxidant smoothies with pomegranates and Acai.",

    "text": "Whoa!  Lots of reviews on this place makes me realize I've been daft not coming to this place earlier despite it being closer to me than Lux or Willow House ... and ... i enjoyed it much more than either one of those other places.   The barista (not sure if it was the owner since it was my first visit) was really polite and witty and even made me a Chai Charger to my exact specifications.     The outdoor seating was simply perfect for a cool January morning and was shaded by the building because somehow the Arizona sun never takes a break from gettin' yo ass, no matter what season it is.  We could enjoy hot coffee (or chai), smoke squares, and chat in a semi-private setting.  The charm of this building is what originally attracted me to the place, but the great drinks and setting is what will keep me coming back.",

    "text": "I'll throw in my 2 cents on Copper Star Coffee. I stopped in yesterday for the first time with a friend of mine. I had a raspberry Ghirardeli Chocolate mocha and he had a blended toffee drink of some sort. He said it was \"super yumtastic\". I knew his intent was to convey to me his like of said beverage, but I reminded him it wasn't a word and then we continued to enjoy ourselves.   The interior is very industrial-cool. Brick walls exposed, ceiling exposed, all the electrical wiring in tubes running serpentine along the walls.   Fresh baked items are made on the premises and if I hadn't just eaten a huge lunch, I would have sampled a brownie. It looked super yumtastic. Dammit, I guess it is a word. Anyway, it will give me a reason to go back.  The converted gas station also has a huge garage door that, on nice days like yesterday, is opened. Even if you're sitting inside, you can enjoy a bit of the outdoors as well.",

    "text": "After reading all the reviews I had to check it out.  Unfortunately, I think I'm going to have to go again.  Not that it's bad that I'm going again mind you, it's just that I didn't really get to see it tonight.  Ok, I saw it....  (Talking in circles, Kristin - get it together....)  We walked up.  There was a crowd.  They all seemed to be looking one direction.  And then, before we'd finished crossing the street I knew that we were about to enter....   The Poetry Reading zone!  Don't get me wrong, I love a little poetry reading now and then.  But they'd kinda taken over the place.  I wanted to see the Star in its natural environment.  Instead we walked in mid performance (about a donut without a hole and its chance for better in the next life - from what I overheard) and practically tip-toed over to the counter.  As we couldn't speak up, the barrista didn't hear us approach (She was making some sort of baked good with her hands all up in it).  Finally, when folks clapped, she walked over and whispered to us so we didn't interrupt the performance.    Yea, she was nice, the Chai was good, and the brownie was rockin. And the place was just as beautiful as the pictures I'd seen. I SO love the bathroom sink!  But I still feel like I haven't BEEN there.  I've been to the Copper Star Poetry Hour - but not to the Copper Star.    Oh darn.  Forced to re-visit a cool coffee place.  So tragic.    Maybe I should write a poem about it....",

I loved the comfortable feel of the space, the local art, and if I were rating just on baristas, I would ask for a sixth star to be added to my review.   When deciding what to order, I asked several questions,  and the barista asked if I'd been in before. I mentioned it was my first time, and she said my HUGE lemon scone was on the house then. Free pastries may be the way to my heart, but even if it wasn't free I would've still loved my visit here. Definitely get the lemon scone (perfectly not too sweet). They make all their baked goods in house, and the variety is impressive.   I also tried the cubano which is a drink made with espresso shots pulled with sugar and has condensed milk added to it. I've never had anything like it, and I kinda want to go back now just for another one. Warning: combining pastries and the cubano might be too much sugar for those without a big sweet tooth. Can't wait to go back!",

Reason being: it's converted from an old gas station. Which. Is. AWESOME. Haha! Totally fits the Melrose vibe.  The experience was very enjoyable. The man who served my friend and I was very polite and very bright/positive/kind. My friend ordered an Arnold Palmer and was served a HUGE cup full of delicious, obviously-made-from-scratch beverage. We were then told that refills for the drink would be free all day, even if we decided to leave then come back later! Wild.  Have not tried the coffee yet as I was not in much of a drinking or eating mood, but I do intend to visit again soon. They were serving food around us the whole time we were there and everything looked really good. They also had delicious-looking pastries, plenty of seating (inside and outside), and even some cool little handmade trinkets.  If you haven't been to Copper Star Coffee, it's honestly one of those unassuming little hidden treasures and deserves a visit the first chance you get. Very unique little place. Can't wait to go back when I'm thirsty for some coffee!!",

I was running late to a workshop in Central Phoenix and the traffic was so bad that I thought, \"What the heck?\" The sign stated there was a drive-thru so I decided to check it out.   It technically isn't a drive-thru, as peeps come out to take your order right at your car. I was behind another car for only a few minutes and a handsome man, named Bill, asked if I had been helped. I told him no and that I had never been there. He said he would buy me a muffin for my first visit. I politely declined as I have gluten allergies. He told me they had a gluten free muffin and he would get me one. He started to tell me what kind of berry, but he had me at \"gluten free.\"   He went inside, got my coffee and muffin. I paid, and waived as I drove away, thinking to myself that I will most definitely be back to the Cooper Star and I will tell ALL of my friends!   Great service! You put the Star in Cooper Star!",

I'm not really a coffee drinker, but sometimes I crave some sort of sweet & delicious coffee concoction! Because I am not an avid coffee drinker, I left it up to the barista. She made a delicious drink for me & I asked her how I should order it the next time I came. She said it was a \"Dulce de Leche iced latte, with 4 shots of espresso\". I was very thankful.  Today, I left the house craving that same drink.  I sat in the drive thru for a bit & this woman comes out so I asked if I can have an \"Iced Dulce de Leche latte\". I fumbled my words a bit & she gave me a squished up, disgruntled look & said, like a complete bitch, \"You want an iced dulshaylaayche latte?\" Totally making fun of the way I messed up my words. So I repeated syllable by syllable & she still had that stupid condescending squinty look on her face & said \"So you mean CARAMEL?!\". I had enough. I wasn't there to be belittled by a miserable woman who clearly hates her job. I understand that coffee is her first language, but it isn't mine. I am a customer & I shouldn't be made to feel like I am an inconvenience to your place of business by ordering a basic iced latte. I told her to forget about it & started to pull away. Of course her snarled lips & squinty, annoyed face immediately dropped and she started telling me to stay. Too little, too late, you miserable woman. Find a new job.",

However, there is one employee in particular who I've just reached my limit with. The only reason I'm complaining about him on here is out of a concern for the shop's well-being. I fear that if a customer were to come to Copper Star for the first time when he is working they would form an entirely inaccurate opinion of this wonderful place.   I don't know his name, but he is usually there for closing shifts. He has a septum piercing, and tends to wear a look on his face of utter disdain every time I step through the door.   As a fellow barista: I get it. Dealing with the public can be rough. Therefore, when I interact with anyone in customer service I'm extremely tolerant of grumpiness. People have bad days. That being said, this particular barista has NEVER been pleasant out of the upwards of five times that I have been to the shop while he's working.   I truly, truly love this place and hope that this review is understood purely to be an effort to help. The pastries are amazing, and literally every other barista is fantastic.",

You also get free refills all day on tea. Their coffee is really good and you get one free refill and any refills after that are only 50 cents. Their hummus tray was the best one I've ever had! It was better than Pita Jungle or any of those places..it's also not over priced. I highly recommend the hummus tray and the iced green tea! Yum!

    "text": "Went here for the first time today- wanted coffee but didn't want Starbucks again. I found this place on yelp. Parking was hard to come by so I parked on a street, no big deal. The drive through didn't make sense to me- I know the place used to be a gas station but I'm not sure how the drive through works. I didn't see a speaker or anything to tell someone your order to. Again not a big deal because I kinda wanted to see inside. I liked the old feel of it and the people who worked there were nice and helpful. Apparently you get a free pastry if it's your first time. I got a lemon tart and it's huge so I'll take it home to the kids. I ordered an iced cubano coffee with almond milk and it's pretty good. More coffee for the same price than I would have gotten at Starbucks and I don't feel like I'm just tossing more money to a corporation since it's not a franchise. They have food there too but I wasn't really looking for food at the time. I would come back for sure.",

It's a converted gas station that kept much of the retro aesthetics, including the vestigial pumps out front. The interior is cozy and quiet, and a great place to relax with your friends. They have always excelled in their lattes and mochas, especially of the Lavender or \"Tuxedo\" varieties. If you'd like a sugar rush with your caffeine, you'll certainly leave fulfilled.   Overall, I'll always be a huge fan of their style, and how seamlessly this cafe integrates with a bustling neighborhood--it's never garish or pretentious, but it is humble and good-spirited. A top 5 coffee stop in midtown.",

So, I am always excited to find new businesses I haven't been to before and Copper Star Coffee was no exception.  Unlike, the chain coffee shops , Copper Star Coffee actually makes you feel welcomed.  The artwork on the walls grabs your attention and gives you something to look at while you wait on some of the  very best coffee you have ever had.    Trust me, when I say, I love coffee. I am always trying out new coffee spots and Copper Star is serving up some of the very best.  Copper Star has the best Americano, hands down, the perfect mix of rich espresso and a light layer of crema. They also offer a  20 ounce drink sizes, so for the professional coffee drinker.  In addition, to a large variety of coffee and tea, Copper Star has a delicious display of muffins, brownies, scones, cinnamon rolls, cookies, and breakfast sandwiches. On my next visit I'll be sure to try a few.  If you're ever in the neighborhood, please check it out and unlike that chain coffee shop, this is a local shop and you know you are supporting the local economy.  .",

The Cubano was excellent....not to mention the DELICIOUS pastries behind the glass counter. The staff is always nice and greet me when I walk in. Honestly, I would rather go here than to those OTHER coffee places nearby which are always crowded and overrated. Last time I went to the OTHER place, my Cubano tasted like an Americano with extra sweetner added. I was so upset that I dumped the coffee and went back to Copper Star. Unfortunately I live on 180th Avenue and I have to wait until I get to work (15th Avenue and Indian School) before I can get my coffee fix!! Anyway, this place looks nice and clean. Give it a try next time you're in the area of 7th Avenue just north of Indian School. Look for a gas station with a coffee sign. The parking is limited so you may have to drive around a bit before you find a parking spot. Sometimes the garage door is open and the smell of coffee hits you as you're driving up.",

I love the location and the set-up of the place, but I don't think their pastries and non-coffee drinks are anything special. I don't drink coffee, so I guess I'm missing half of what they have to offer. Regardless, this is a great place to go chill and have a conversation at.  This place is five blocks from my house and I really should make a habit of coming here a bit more. I tend to hit up Lux more often, but I think this place offers a more homey feel. Lux is cool, but ultimately you feel like you're eating/drinking in an art space and Copper Star is more of a place to get cozy and do your homework over a cup of tea. Anyway, definitely check this place out because it's become a fixture of sorts in the upper central part of downtown and on First Fridays.",

I am lucky that I live in a location where I have a multitude of options (Lux, Lola, Hob Nobs, SBUX, etc) but I have to say I really liked the vibe here. The music wasn't loud, the people relatively quiet and chill, and I could actually focus on what I was doing without getting too distracted by everything around me. I liked that while on a busy street (7th Ave), the entrance and windows actually face the side street it is on. That added to the peace and quiet of it. Employees were nice, free wi-fi (internet key is needed but on a sign in the shop), and I enjoyed my small, mint mocha with a chocolate chip cookie (both just under $7). I was definitely eyeing the cupcakes in the bakery window but my tummy only had enough room for a cookie (which was soooo good if I might say). They are open until 9pm on Sundays which is pretty cool. I have yet to use their drive through for coffee, but they are open pretty early which is nice competition to SBUX. There is also outdoor seating which will be so nice when it starts to cool off....you can give your dog a bath at Wag-n-Wash next door and then sit outside with them while you enjoy some local coffee.",

Just wanted a nice salad and some protein after the gym and settled for their signature curried chicken. It was very little salad, very little chicken rolled up in a LOT of bread, which I don't eat. 10 bucks for that and a cup of coffee and I left starving.......oh well, it's great for coffee and dessert! Bill  if you read this PLEASE give us more options.",

I can tell you guys that the few times I have ordered a coffee at Copper Star I didn't need a nap that day.

    "text": "I've written other reviews in the past and I have contributed MANY pics (one of a frozen fountain went viral in my FB purview). I've been a patron since they opened their doors. It took them a while, and I remember driving past every day to work, south on 7th, on my way to my position of public service (as a dedicated state employee) watching that sign (opening soon) for months and months wondering WHEN they would finally open.  Anyway, I noticed a couple of less than favorable reviews in Yelp and though I dont challenge their accuracy, and though there are MANY excellent 5 star reviews I feel compelled to reiterate some observations.  The owner (and his Board of Director(s)) rescued a dilapidated gas station and invested money to redeem and try to retain the integrity of the neighborhood feel of the original building.  The bathrooms have some interesting design, by a local. (I had started a list of PHX bathrooms of note on Foursquare and then got distracted -- the former Florist and the former/current Christopher's had some interesting ones.)  The bakers in the past AND present have/do all create delightful confections (though I continue to petition for more savory).  The interior ambiance is sufficient. And has gone through some changes over time to meet the whims of customers and ownership.  The landscape is maintained by a local who is also a patron.  The cute little fireplace is stoked by a local, whenever he chooses to come by, and feels like doing it.  This is a dog friendly place and I love all the dogs that frequent it.  The owner...he cares about what he does and he is quite engaged in his neighborhood and his community. This coffee shop, this project, is something he CHOOSES to do. He is supported by his Board of Director(s) because of the service this small business contributes to others.  So, remember that there are NO automatons here. What is here is a choice, despite health, wealth, hassle, obstruction or disappointments.  Thank you to the staff, management, operations, ownership (and Board of Directorship) for keeping on--keeping on.",

At this point we have to try a new coffee shop. We have tried for months with Copper Star but now we feel like the staff is on pins and needles with us because of the past mistakes.

Make sure you don't venture too far into their parking lot in the alley though, because it is hard to turn around and get yourself out of there.   This place is cozy and always less crammed and busy than their neighbors on Central, but I sense that part of the reason for this is that their stuff just isn't quite up there in consistent quality with said neighbors. Consistency is really important to me when it comes to my beloved caffeinated beverages, and I'd say it's about 60/40 whether or not my espresso tastes a little burninated in my drinks here or my iced tea tastes like it was left steeping a bit too long.   However, the staff here is genuinely nice and their baked goods are incredible. My old boss used to bring me a rice krispy treat from here regularly and man do I miss those. If you come in here at night, they might toss an extra treat in your bag to clear out their case for the next day!  All-in-all, while this place doesn't serve the best latte in Phoenix, the ambience is there. To me, Copper Star is less of a morning coffee rush than it is a relaxing place to stop after work and unwind with a nice drink. Highly recommend the iced earl grey when you can get it!",

The coffee is good, and more importantly (according to my wife), the iced tea is waaaaay better here than anywhere else around. Win! Took me a while to take in the decor and get my head around all the details that make this such a great spot - the coffee bean bags on the ceiling, the artwork on the walls, the drive-through that's was a gas station forecourt, the pulley chain is even still in the ceiling! It's a renovation triumph.   But not forgetting, the coffee cake is delicious and the service is perfect. Five stars from me.",

I always appreciate when owners are around and present with their employees. It shows that they care and it shows great leadership. He's always nice and smiling. Very nice man.   The cold brew is good. They have good milk alternatives too, which is awesome! Their chai is too sweet for me, but everything else is quality and awesome! Also, their iced teas are yummy! I also like their artwork inside and LOVE that they have a drive through!   Definitely go if you actually like coffee and people. I always recommend this place to my family and friend.",

The staff is friendly and unhurried. There is plenty of seating with options inside, in front and in back. There were even friendly little birds that came up to my plate and ate crumbs from it.

Usually twice a week to work while enjoying some food & coffee of course! The staff are all super nice & down to earth which makes spending time here way more pleasant. All the drinks I've tried are awesome but my absolute favorite is an iced Tuxedo Mocha (with soy). If you like chocolate & you like your coffee really sweat, this is the drink for you! Even when I'm not working I'll swing through the drive-thru to to get one. Oh yeah, they have a drive-thru! Talk about convenient! Lastly, let's discuss the food. I've made it a point to venture away from my favorites - a breakfast bagel or a BLT - to try other items which then also become favorites! I'm always so happy with how tasty & satisfying the food is. Regardless of how often I come here, I'm never bored or displeased. Nuff said!",

    "text": "I love supporting small local coffee shops and this one did not disappoint. The shop was a charming one -- once a gas station and now remodeled into a functional coffee shop! There was a line even on a later-than-normal weekday morning, so you know this is where it's at. I went later in the morning at ~7am, but they do open as early at 5am; perfect for when you need an early start, but don't want to be starving on your drive.   I ordered a *Lavender Mocha* as well as a *Breakfast Bagel* on my quick stop here. They don't mess around and make sure to stock a variety of bagels. The bagels are massive too, so the breakfast bagel with scrambled eggs and ham (I held the American cheese) was the real deal for $5.18. Splendid! The Lavender Mocha was as solid as ever and made with tender loving care by an ever-friendly staff. It was only a dash of lavender with heavy chocolate-y notes. They have other breakfast items/ sandwiches on the menu and everything is made-to-order. Service was speedy; the staff was quick about getting your order started even though you were still waiting to order at the cash register. Delicious coffee and food -- you cannot go wrong there!",

The owner is so kind and caring - one time, when a car wreck was blocking the exit to the drive through, he let everyone waiting in the drive through line have a free coffee! Copper Star truly gets the small-business spirit and knows what it means to be a part of the community.",

The staff is amazing I find myself coming in every day whether it's the drive thru or to sit and study for awhile I love seeing all of them and they make you feel so welcome I don't even have to tell them my order they already know ! The pastries are fantastic the food is great as well lots of different options for you to try.

Converted gas station into a coffee station with kitschy interior - literally no bare nor boring spot on the walls!  There was a bit of a line when we arrived which in theory should give me time to figure out what to order. Their focus is heavy on coffee/tea which some bakery goods (to my knowledge at the time). I got a little flustered when the line cut short quickly and one of the baristas asked me what I wanted. When I explained I'd never been there, she welcomed me warmly and gave suggestions based on my love of cold coffee. I grabbed a bagel too and didn't know I had to specify light/little cream cheese because they shcmear that shiz on there. Pro tip tell them what you want on the bagel! Apparently they have more than bakery goods but their menu doesn't specify that.   My iced coffee was really good - creamy, not bitter nor acidic. When I went up to pay for a refill, the same barista told me it was on the house being my first visit. Looking forward to more drinks at this place when I'm in the neighborhood!",

    "text": "I'd been hearing about Copper Star Coffee for a long time, and I was excited that I finally got the chance to try it. There were some things I liked and some things that weren't so great.   Service was great, really friendly and prompt. There's a decent amount of street parking and seating inside and out. There are large tables, bar seating, and couches. This cafe used to be an old gas station, so it has that rustic feel yet is remodeled on the inside. The menu boasts of interesting items like lavender lattes and handmade italian cream sodas. Wifi is free and pretty reliable, no spotty areas or dropped connections as far as I could tell.   The biggest con for me was the smell. Copper Star serves food items as well as drinks and pastries, and this was apparent from the moment I walked in. There was a savory, smoky smell that permeated the entire inside and made my clothes smell like it even after I'd left (I'd studied there for a couple of hours, but it was very noticeable). It wasn't the kind of smell that went away either.. my senses didn't really adjust to it and it seemed to be wafting. I'd hazard a guess that it was their ham because it reminded me of smoked ham split pea soup, but it wasn't pleasant and irritated my throat a bit.  Chai latte: This chai is made in-house, but it is pre-sweetened and was on the sweet side for me. There wasn't that nice kick of spiciness at the end that I prefer in my chais, and overall the spices were on the mild side. I also asked for extra hot and this came out closer to room temperature, which was disappointing. If you like milder, smooth, and creamy chais, this would be for you.  Peanut butter cookie: This was a ginormous cookie, and I thought it was made pretty well. It was chewy and flavorful, and I think it's hard to get that balance because peanut butter can so often be chalky. It also wasn't too sweet, and the peanut butter struck a nice balance to the sweetness.  Italian cream soda: The raspberry lemon cream soda had a pretty color, and I liked that you could see the cream dispersing on top. I'm not sure if they use lemonade or lemon juice, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't lemon syrup because the dairy separated quite quickly and looked like it was beginning to curdle. It almost reminded me of the beginnings of making buttermilk, which makes me think it was lemon juice or lemonade. I'm also not positive whether it was milk or half and half or heavy cream, but either way, it looked quite chunky and viscous rather than a cream soda a few minutes in.   Overall I'm on the fence about whether I'd return. I can definitely see why a lot of people love Copper Star, and I might give it another shot if I'm in the area.",

This place should seriously have its own reality show. It's charming and right out of a story book.",

    "text": "I tried Copper Star for the first time this week on my search for the best \"real\" coffee shops in the valley. A \"real\" coffee shop is what I call a place that takes pride in their coffee, isn't a giant corporation, and most importantly... LATTE ART! Yes, this is my new obsession. We have a severe lack of latte art in Arizona in my opinion. Anyway, long story short, I was disappointed. First of all, the seating area is the size of a small living room. This meant no seating open, as it was packed. Second and most importantly, the girl at the register had an obvious scowl on her face. No greeting or acknowledgment while I walked up to order. Not even a smile. It was as if she was in pain. Or maybe it was just Resting Bitch Face. Either way - no excuse for someone who works with the public. That immediately turned me off to this place. I ordered a coconut latte, and the barista was nice and friendly. Maybe Lux spoiled me, but I expected my latte to be presented in a REAL mug with, of course, my beloved latte art. No luck. Paper cup with the kind of foam you get at Starbucks. :(  However, the latte tasted good, not very bitter and the right amount of sweetness. This is the only reason I'd ever go back, but even then it'd be a last resort coffee stop. I'm not sure why everyone seems to love it here. Maybe I came on an off day. Yes, I think it's True... Lux has spoiled me with their dreamy latte art and cozy mug with the cute little plate underneath it. If you're trying to decide where you should spend your time and money, do yourself a favor and drive down the street to Lux instead.",

From the quaint \"drive through\" that turned out to be a door you simply pull up to and an employee comes out to take your order from you while you sit in your car.. to the eclectic and hip interior. I was sold even before I sat down to take a sip of one of the most delish  mochas I've had in the states. Strong and rich w/o being too sweet!!! Perfect! This chocolaty masterpiece easily surpasses mochas de la Starbucks.   Cooper Star is on my \"Visit Again & Again\" list.   If you are reading this ignore all the other reviews that say less and come visit this place yourself. Simply delightful!!",

Theoretically, I know I should be take advantage of the cooler morning temperatures and mow my lawn, but that's what Sundays are for, right? If you ask me, Saturday mornings are much better suited for relaxing and sipping coffee. Thankfully, I live just down the street from Copper Star Coffee (and luckily for my dog, Copper Star is right next door to Wag 'n Wash). The setup of this place is perfect, super cute converted gas station, and plenty of space on the patio for my pup to play greeter. You can get pretty much any kind of coffee/espresso drink you like, but I really dig the plain 'ol brewed coffee. Oh, and don't get me started on the tasty treats ogling me from their strategic position inside the glass case. The pastries are so yummy and cupcakes are irresistible (and share-with-a-friend-enormous).  Hmm, on second thought, waking up early on a Saturday may just be my body's way of telling me get to Copper Star before they run out of chocolate raspberry croissants.",

The coffee and cupcakes are awesome, the atmosphere is equally as good, and with free wi-fi and comfortable seating this one of my favorite places to do homework or just chill.  The only issue this place has is the parking.  There are literally 2 off-street parking spots, and the rest is park at the curb...lucky me I am one of the fortunate ones living within walking (or biking) distance.  The coolest thing about this place though is Bill the owner, and the rest of his friendly staff.  I've frequented other coffee shops in the area, and don't frequent them anymore specifically because of the pretentious, snobby staff at those establishments.  From the first day I walked in to Copper Star however, Bill was super friendly striking up a conversation and really making me feel welcome.  His staff always seems to be in a good mood, and if they are coffee snobs like me they don't ever show it.  If you haven't been here yet, stop what you are doing and go check it out now!",

    "text": "Copper Star Coffee is one of my favorite local, central Phoenix, coffee houses (in addition to Hob Nobs and Lux). Copper Star Coffee is located in a converted, vintage, automotive service and gas station right along a growing 7th Avenue corridor. What sets Copper Star apart from some of the other local coffee houses is their car hop service. There are times when I find myself in a hurry and a drive through is convenient. Although there is a Starbucks equipped with a drive through a mile north, I prefer to keep my dollars local and the fact that Copper Star has a drive through help me do just that. Each time I visit Copper Star, there is always something different in the way of pastries or muffins. On one visit in November they had scratch-made pumpkin and raisin muffins. I'm not a big fan of pumpkin in any form other than pie, but I over heard someone there mention they were really good. Being in a festive mood that day I bought one and was very pleased. As far as I know, everything is made in-house or is local. The Batista's pull a mean shot. When it's 110 degrees out, nothing tastes better than an iced double americano (no cream). I'm not sure where they get their coffee from exactly, but it full-flavored without being over roasted. Free WiFi is a great perk as I've gone there several times to read my morning digital news. The staff is always friendly and the service prompt.",

I was excited to support a locally owned establishment (even though I am a Starbucks shareholder!)   I arrived  and a very nice gentleman waited on me.  The tea selection was really great.  I found a table, and had to wipe it off myself from the crumbs that were left from the previous customer.  When my client arrived, I asked her what she wanted to drink and she only wanted water, I waited while the young gal (now the only one working) made a coffee for someone and when she waited on me, I asked for a water, she seemed irritated and she filled a cup of water from the faucet and was handing it to me when I had to ask for ice.  She was clearly irritated that I asked for ice in the water.   My client noticed that too and felt bad.  The atmosphere was nice, the music was at a nice moderate level where you could conduct business, read a book or concentrate on your computer.  I might give it another visit if I am in that part of town again, to see if the young gal has gotten a clue that that client is the one that makes her paycheck, but I won't make a special trip.",

I can't offer feedback on the coffee because I'm a tea drinker.  It's the monster, refillable iced teas that keep me coming back.  They have several to choose from, and are very generous with the servings.  This is a very good thing in the summer time.    The pastries are freakin' awesome.  Love the baked goods, except maybe for the bagels.  They're just ok.  Otherwise, if you love a great muffin, they have 'em.  The lunch items are a weak point.  I've eaten lunch here a few times, and I was never satisfied on any occasion.  The first time, they didn't have the ingredients necessary to make the meal, and tried to concoct some frankenwich that was just odd.  I ended up swapping it out for hummus plate that was just- meh.  The second time, I ordered the turkey sub. Again- meh.  Today, the veggie sandwich.  It wasn't very good, and it didn't have the same ingredients listed on the menu.  Also, the lunches don't come with chips or salads or any type of side.  Go elsewhere for food.  Other than that, it's a great place to chill out and study.  It's also a nice stop-in while I get my dog grooomed.",

I can't say anything about their wi-fi since I don't have a laptop but just for the atmosphere and their support of good radio I have to max out on the star count.  *********************  Addendum 3/4/09  Nova-M is dead but Copper Star lives on and rocks just as hard as they always did!!!",

I love the uniqueness of this place - the drive thru with cheerful baristas (os) and  the owner (Bill)  is actively involved in the community and knows his fellow business owners.  Nicest guy you could ever meet.  Ok.   Now let's get down to business. Coffee- Everyone has a different taste in coffee. I love this coffee so much that I buy their beans by the pound.  It usually is a mix of Ethiopian, Guatemalen and Sumatran or other roast.  Anyway - I can't say that I have been to  a whole lot of different coffee bars in Phoenix,  but the ones I have been to don't  measure up in flavor, freshness and robust flavor of the beans. Nor can anyone  match  the friendliness and unpretentiousness of the staff.    I have only tried the scones and muffins.   Scones are a difficult feat in most places but Copper Star has some of the tastiest.  Try the chocolate chip or cranberry walnut scone.   During the fall they make homemade pumpkin muffins  (using fresh pumpkin) that are to die for.  They run out so fast you have to get there early.  I wish they would offer these year round.Yum!    Because of the coffee, service , and the limited # of goodies I have tried so far, plus their community involvement,  I am giving this place 5 stars. The patio is very small  with a nice fountain and you can bring your dog - After your coffee take Fido across the street for a bath at Wag-N-Wash (but that is a different review).  So, if you happen to be in the neighborhood stop by and check out Copper Star.  You'll be glad you did.  (Say Hi to \"Mr Bill \" for me!)",

Their pastries are excellent and the coffee is ok--it depends on what you order. I've always had a much better experience on weekday mornings vs. evenings and weekends.",

I don't normally drink coffee so they served me up an enormous glass of iced green tea and a huge cupcake from the case. The cupcake tasted a little boxy but the iced tea was light and refreshing, and their small advertising section with flyers for local bands and other extracurricular activities just might point you in the direction of an excellent show or an interesting new hobby... it did for me. :)",

    "text": "Rating: 4.5 Stars. A real, True, legitimate coffee shop!  What I Liked: Coffee was decent (ordered an Iced Mocha). The fresh-out-of-the-oven Cheese Danish was AMAZING though...and definitely worth a trip back. The atmosphere was peaceful, the staff was friendly, and I LOVE that they bake their own goods in-house (a rarity these days).  Room For Improvement: The coffee was decent...it was good...but I was hoping for outstanding. I prefer a stronger, smokier roast. Also, the wi-fi was deplorable. It was beyond intermittent--it would be on for one minute, then off for 5. Very frustrating.  Overall: If they improved their internet, and I ordered stronger drinks from them, then Copper Star is/would be the perfect coffee shop. I'm a fan; if you live anywhere nearby, you owe it to yourself to frequent this place. ...Why can't we have a real coffee shop like this in Ahwatukee!?!",

I never know what to order on the rare occasion I do find myself in a coffee place like this,but I do know it'll be expensive. So I ask about iced teas.The lady behind the counter who was uber friendly and nice recommeneded a few different things and I went with some herbal thingamajig. Got a BIG cup full of light goodness.I was expecting to hear something like 5 bux,but it was only 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! would I go back?I might rabbit,I might. Except some of of the denizens were of the hipster faux hippie persuasion,and well,I didn't care all too much for the great unwashed the first time around and I would prefer my tea hippieless here in the new millenium.

I really love the open and friendly atmosphere and I feel like the layout of the furniture really lends itself for people to interact and chat. They have a good internet connection, and I love me some free wifi. I can camp out and do homework for a couple hours and not feel like I am bothering anyone. The staff is friendly but it's a little awkward to see them canoodling with their significant others on the patio, and then come inside and start serving.. I don't watch too carefully but I am assuming (hoping) there is a quick trip to the (still lovely) washroom between.  I've had a few pastries, the blueberry muffins are good, but pretty standard, and I'm fairly certain from a mix,  but the red velvet cupcakes are fresh and tasty. Coffee is again, good, but not great, but this is definitely a great place to hangout, grab a snack, chit chat, enjoy the ambiance, and use the toilet.",

The place is cute, but others are right when they say there is a weird smell. We each got a latte and a chocolate croissant. The baristas were friendly enough and cute, but they messed up our deal.... our bill came out to 15$ even, and we had the deal for 10$. They charged us 5.95 because the 'tax wasn't included.' Well, the deal is for 10$ in products and we exceeded that, therefore paying the tax within the 5$. I thought that was lame, but I digress, the coffee was good, I liked the milky flavor and I liked that their sizes were a bit more generous than other places for the same price. The coffee was not too acidic and had a strong enough flavor. The croissant, however, was not good at all. It says on their wall they won for best cupcake in phoenix last year.... well I hope it was much better than this, because this was a poor excuse for a croissant. It was not flaky at all, it had more of a donut consistency and the chocolate had a waxy texture. Not good. I would probably go back for coffee.... that's all.",

They also have a few sandwiches and a delicious hummus plate that comes with kalamata olives and warm pita bread. I think they now have a daily homemade soup as well. And during the last holiday season, the owners wife was spotted making homemade pumpkin pies! I don't think anything on the menu is more than $5.50.   Nice atmosphere, not too crowded, not too loud. Free wifi - the password is on the wall above the hallway to the restrooms. A great neighborhood place to hang out, but you can also drive through. Great service. Cheerful staff. Delicious goods. And you can feel good about supporting local business instead of a huge soulless chain. The owner, Bill, is super friendly.  My one gripe is they have had the same two couches and red lounge chairs pretty much since they opened, but I don't think they have EVER cleaned them. They now look disgustingly filthy and I'm always shocked when I see someone actually go sit down at them. I can't sit over there, I have to keep to the wood chairs and tables. I go to Copper Star once a week, but the filth on the fabric covered seating is grossing me out enough that I may reduce my visits until they have the upholstery cleaners come in.",

(until *surprise* my stamp card is full again?!)  the coffee is not the best in the city.. but at least it's local and that counts for something. plus i like the concept of gas station gone coffee shop.

    "text": "Great atmosphere!  It may be an acquired taste for Starbucks drinkers such as myself.  I'll admit I usually drink iced NF sugar-free vanilla lattes with whip at Starbucks.  I told the barista and he was very nice about trying to make a similar coffee concoction.  (Are they \"baristas\" everywhere? Sounds so pretentious.) I'd like to say I loved his version but it wasn't as sweet.  (I know, I'm a huge sweet tooth spoiled by corporate coffee peddlers.) My mom usually gets a Venti White Chocolate Frappuccino so the barista whipped up something similar but she also felt hers wasn't sweet enough.  I say hey, check the place out, the atmosphere's GREAT and the staff sure does try but if you like your coffee drinks sweet be forewarned, they may not taste sweet enough.",

This place was really cool but now it's FULL of a weird crowd of old hipsters. weird. Now I feel underdressed when i go in here. Though the live music is still cool, it's impossible to sit down because you're squished in like sardines. We had to take the kids outside to sit down last time. They should have the band play outside rather than right next to the counter. It's all arranged very awkwardly. The drinks are just drinks. They're good, but just normal coffee shop drinks. All in all, I'm no longer impressed. Super bummer.. such a cool lookin spot.",

    "text": "I enjoy Copper  Star. I have only ordered tea and a cupcake from here. The tea is good, but occassionally has a slight coffee taste. It comes in a huge cup and I don't know if this has changed or not, but you can go back and get a free refill on the same day which is great. The cup cake was very yummy.  Though the last time I was at Copper Star I did find the two gals working to be kind of rude, which was odd considering any other time I have been there the service has always been friendly.  I do think parking is a major pain. Their parking lot accomdates two to three vehicles after that you will have to park in the neighborhood in front of someone's house. I really only get to go to Copper Star when I visit my dad as he lives in the area, but if I lived closer I would go more often as it's a pretty laid back place to hang and sip on some coffee or tea.",

There has been some male staff who were very friendly and love their job. This one female employee was rude. And she  looked like she did not want to be there. I noticed a new menu I had mentioned that this menu is new to me and that I was not ready yet to order. Obviously they were not very busy that day. This employee would be standing there with this impatient look. When I ordered something she would tell me they didn't have it. And I ordered something else and she would tell me the same thing. I asked her. What do you guys have? She would tell me and I just ordered a coffee and left. Their menu items listed appeared more expensive. And the art work on their walls has gotten uninteresting unfortunately. A friend of mine when there and told me that the manager lost his restaurant business and I'm wondering that is why the prices went up. I wish them luck.",

The staff is friendly and they have vegan options for their baked goods. While Copper Star has a great reputation, it is also a place you have to try more than once for it to grow on you.  This tiny cafe is a great spot to catch up or meet with a group, and the Yarn-Knitting Club may still meet there on Wednesday evenings.  The first time I came, I tried their Lavender Mocha and it just wasn't that great. The mocha overpowered the lavender, and when I did taste the lavender it tasted harsh. I spoke with a barista afterward and they agreed that that is a tough mix to get right, but to give CS a second chance. With that in mind, I bravely came back and I ordered an iced Raspberry Mocha latte instead, and I was sold. Every morning, well, most mornings, I drive up to the dinky drive thru to get my Raspberry Mocha on the way to work, and even though it's rich in mocha, it's a damn strong brew, and it's all I need to get my day started.",

SO glad we were able to finally make it over here. Full menu, which I loved, as well as SO many options of pastries to choose from. The staff is AMAZING and ALL so nice! All the girls were so happy and upbeat and seemed genuinely excited to have us in for the first time (we told them). The Cubano is delicious! I like it better hot than cold and I get mine with almond milk. The ONLY teeny little part I did not like about this place was the charge for almond milk.. A lot of places don't do that anymore, it's usually just an option of milk to choose from - a little disappointing, but I would still come back. I got a little card to start collecting stamps, which I love any place that rewards returning customers. They even sell clothes and jewelry which was a unique, cool touch to this place. They have a drive through which I can not express how much I LOVE THAT! Can't wait to use that next time, for my first time in I wanted to go IN. All of their pastries are VERY large, and with a sweet tooth like mine, I can't wait to try everything they have! Hands down, great amazing place I was so happy to find. I put pictures on my snap chat that day and I got SO many people asking me where I went! Was happy to spread the word on this hidden gem, I look forward to telling more people!",

Also have used them for catering breakfast, and they're extremely attentive and very reasonably priced.  Their best-kept secret?  The Chicken Curry Salad (yes, salad...try it that way instead of the wrap).  And I don't even like curry!  I only wish they still made their peanut butter fudge squares!  Highest recommendation!",

I wouldn't want a starbucks here instead, but still there are some constant stupid complaints I have about the place.   Today I sat trying to read something as their phone (an annoying cubicle sounding telephone) rang and rang for about 5 minutes straight. It's a small place, so this was loud and really annoying. Then there is their music. It's not great. They just have employees (nice people) playing streaming music on their phones. Music ranges from tolerable to bad, but it's never ever ever interesting music. And then, when the employee gets a call on that phone, it amplifies their ring tone over the speakers, until the employee picks up their phone and cuts out the music while they chat to their friends.  And cleanliness. their mens room is disgusting. I have a 2 year old and he always has to pee. I'd rather my son pee on a truck stop toilet. They also have a real fly problem.   It's a cute place, the kind of community coffee shop that puts up really bad local artists work (a good thing to do). But this place with just a little effort could be so much nicer.",

The coffee was good, I would have to say that it was the machine that makes it.    I would never ever come back here at night.  I hear the morning crew and service is awesome.   Something that is lacking at night.  If you want to go to a place where the worker hangs out more with her friends outside, smokes then makes your drinks,  asks if you want to add a tip, and then is rude in the end..then come here on a Friday night...Lux is getting my business.    My advice: Get rid of the girl on Friday night, maybe then you would get some more business instead of her friends  hanging around.",

You've no excuse to escape your work either. Free wi-fi is just a couple of clicks away.

Take advantage of the drive-thru, Starbucks-style as you drive past the antique gas pumps out front. All told, it's a great stop, and you can support another wonderful local business.

Coffee ~ very good, full bodied taste without bitterness and has a good aroma.  Coffee Accompaniments ~ good selection of cookies, pastries, tarts.  I asked them to heat my brownie ; -) it was chocolicious X2!  Service ~ very friendly and happy and eager to please  Decor ~ it used to be much more comfy with more couches and big comfy chairs.  I think they are trying to accommodate more people with the use of big wooden tables and hard chairs. It used to be much more comfy with more room to move and set up better to meet with friends.

I am not sure if they make them in house, but they are exceptional and they go FAST. There are vegan and GF options as well. I love that there is plenty of seating and places to plug in and the wifi is free and you don't have to dance with a barista and prove your worth for the PW - it's written on the wall! My one and only complaint is that whenever I leave here after having spent any more than ten minutes in the building, I smell kinda bad. My clothes and bags,etc. soak up the unique smell of the place, which is a mixture of coffee and something else. Some ventilation might help?? Not sure. It's a dumb thing to complain about considering coffee shops smell like coffee. There are times that I avoid going here because I have somewhere to go after and I don't want to carry that scent with me all day. I would suggest a scone or muffin for sweets, a hummus bagel for eats and a good old fashioned latte for a buzz.",

    "text": "Loved this place.  Out of all the five local coffee joints I stopped by during a trip to Phoenix, this one I'd have to say was the best of them.  I drove past them while pursuing breakfast, but decided to stop by on my way back down 7th, to have a cup of coffee and figure out what to do with the rest of my day.  There isn't a ton of parking, but there is plenty of places to park on the street.  It's a small, cozy, repurposed gas station as everyone else has pointed out, and the interior is simple, yet relaxing feeling.  Parents with their kids sit outside of this kind of place.  Older people relax with a cup of coffee with their dog on a leash at this kind of place.  Younger hipsters hang out inside on their mobile devices at this kind of place.  The garage door was open, so a cool morning in Arizona could be enjoyed by everyone.  The couches inside were precariously cushy as they engulf you when you sit down.  The cookie I ordered as a dessert to breakfast was still warm when it was served to me.  The chocolate chips were gooey and soft, and it was practically right out of a commercial, with a slow camera pan on my hands as I ripped a chunk off with a rivulet of milky chocolate stretching away.  The coffee was not burnt-tasting or overly bitter, and was probably the best I had on my trip.  And everyone who worked there was polite and friendly.  Several of them took the time to address my questions about the area, and if they had any suggestions of anything to do, whether it was in the city or out in Surprise where I was headed.  The experience as a whole was easily worth five stars.  Convenient location, free parking, great atmosphere, friendly staff, and quality products.  Easily a repeat trip next time I'm out in Phoenix.",

You all know I love me some Giant on my Monday mornings (close to work! great vibe! good music!  STELLAR coffee!) and I gotta get down on Jobot on my way in to my second job.  Songbird's been frickin' killin' it with a PERFECT, CONSISTENT spicy chai (make it dirty) and then there's my home coffee shop: Copper Star.    Ooooooooooh, Copper Star, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways. Their drinks are great.  They showcase local art.  The music is good.  Their baristas are genuinely nice people.  Seriously.  I might hug one of them next time I go in.  But it's the FOOD that prompted this post.  Today I discovered their vegan, gluten-free, peanut-butter oatmeal cookies.  I know there are people out there that imagine that vegan and gluten free can't possibly be good, but I honest-to-god believe that the 3 (maybe 3? Maybe 20?) minutes I spent enjoying that cookie may have been some of the best minutes of my life.  I can't really pin down how long it was, because I'm pretty sure that cookie helped me transcend space and time.  SO. Good.  I went back later for the vegan rosemary green chile potato soup.  O.M.G.   Copper Star.   CenPho.  Happy happy happiness.  P.S.  The patio's great too!",

Seriously, they don't ever have an off day. I usually go weekday mornings -- never a problem. Jenny typically visits in the afternoons -- always treated well. More often than not, we go together on a weekend and lounge in the patio misters or on the big orange couches -- always a positive experience. The coffee is the best in the area (we recommended St Francis look to Copper Star to brew up b/c the reject grounds from Cartel are not cutting it) and the service is always excellent. The baked good and food selections make it just that much better. If this were the RenFaire, I'd be totally HUZZAH for Copper Star.",

    "text": "I love this place!  When we lived in the neighborhood we were regulars. Located in the Historic Melrose Neighborhood, Copper Star opened around 2006 when the neighborhood was barely gentrifying.  Businesses were slowly beginning to open and the 7th Ave corridor between Indian School and Camelback was changing.  Now it is a thriving neighborhood.   Owner Bill Sandweg, who brought a range of experience with him such as, TGI Friday's Pizza Uno, Oregano's, & Starbucks, opened a coffee shop in an old Service station.  He found local coffee roasters, got quality teas and slowly built his business with changes and additions every year, making what it is today. I just spoke with Bill a couple days ago who said 2014 was a terrific year for Copper Star, their best. That is thanks to the growing loyal customers as well as Copper Stars success. As businesses began to open Bill joined and his board members help grow small business association for that neighborhood. He is a committee member on the HTJ (Hotter Than July) Chili cook-off & salsa fest. During the Melrose Street Fair you can always stop in for a Iced Coffee or Iced Tea.  Basically Bill is just an all-around good guy. He cares about the neighborhood and the quality of his business.  He has hired a lot of young folks as baristas.  I am sure he has help put a few through college while working there.  I have never had a bad cup of coffee there. At one point they had punch cards you could redeem for a free drink. There were so many people named Mark in the rolodex box, I had Bill change my name to Zeus so they could find my card with less hassle. This is a people, pet, and neighborhood friendly place.  They do have a unique drive-thru, however, I never use the drive through.   I hold a firm opinion that if you intend to visit any coffee shop you should step inside the business. Most quality coffee shops are more than just coffee, they each hold a unique atmosphere or experience. Take time out of your busy day, step inside, you'll get the entire coffee making experience.  Beyond the coffee they have breakfast sandwiches and pastries or light food menu. They have art installations and on some occasions live music. If you attend First Fridays on Melrose, you can stop in for a drink. Kudos to Copper Star for creating a successful local small business that everyone can enjoy and feel welcome.",

William T. describes the place as \"Very old school\"  I agree, This place keeps its simple and relaxing.    Off 7th Ave, its a cool joint, from the outside its noticeably an old gas station and once your inside you know your in a serious coffee house.   Big time fan (3,1/2stars)  Copper Star Coffee is another pit stop that provides this city with its heartbeat.  These little stop shops gives us a little time in society to see or neighbors up close.  Thank you, you small businesses like Copper Star that keep our city one step ahead of our corporate friends such as one that also has a star in their name    4220 N 7th Ave is just North of the Indian school 7th Ave. I lived near hereand what a find.",

Copper Star is never empty, and it is small and cozy, but there always seems to be room for everyone. While they have given the inside the hip, artsy cafe makeover the outside remains True to its historic roots. Copper Star (and the owner Bill) have been huge supporters of the Melrose area business and the historic district's community for as long as I can remember.   The service is usually fantastic, but if you ever have an issue, all you need to do is let them know and they will certainly take care of it. Stop on by!",

The decor is hip with local art covering the walls. It's quiet-most of the time there are people there hanging out on their laptops. (Which begs the question-Do coffee shops pay people to hang out on their laptops? Even the grocery store Starbucks has people hanging out!) Being someone who drinks coffee all the time, I usually opt for nothing too fancy-an iced coffee will do, thank you very much. Oh and can you add some almond milk and vanilla? The coffee here is generally quite good, however sometimes inconsistent. It might not be the coffee though-sometimes the drink just tastes like the syrup is sitting at the bottom. For that reason, I have to knock off a star. :( I still love you Copper Star! Oh and I hardly ever do take advantage of the baked goods but they're always tasty. Get the S'mores brownie if they ever have it and share it with someone so you don't go into a sugar coma.",

    "text": "Copper Star, I love you.  After buying our house in July 2015, we needed to find a new coffee shop. I order an iced americano probably 5-6 days a week and prefer to support the local coffee shops rather than the chains. I found Copper Star and I'm so happy I did!!  Copper Star is my Daily Happy Morning Routine place. I use the drive thru, the staff has my order memorized, and I'm always greeted with a friendly \"hello!\" and a quick chat about my day/car/lipstick shade/what have you. Within just a few minutes, I'm zipping to work with my perfectly made iced 1/2 caff americano with cream.  Helpful tips - enter the drive thru from the west parking lot entrance. Both sides of the old gas pumps are fair game for drive thru speediness. Parking is not plentiful but there's a little lot behind the shop and some street parking as well. Food is super yummy. Ask for a stamp card and get your 10th drink free. Also, for your first visit, you get a free pastry!  If you're hanging around, the indoors is a really cute space with lots of variety of seating options. The patio is great too. Music is always on, and you'll see familiar faces if you come here regularly.   Enjoy!",

    "text": "This was my first visit to Copper Star. I was looking for a local coffee shop that offers drive thru service. I saw that Copper Star had great reviews so I thought I'd check it out. I went in early Sunday morning and once I pulled up to the drive thru, I was greeted by a young lady who was very nice and extremely helpful! They didn't have any type of menu outside, being that this was my first time, I wanted to see what they had to offer beyond the regular latte or cappuccino I always order.  I let her know I'd never been before so she gave me a rundown of their specialty drinks (she was extremely nice about it, not annoyed like some people at other places tend to be). That's when I heard her say Lavender Mocha, lavender syrup made in house, and my eyes went wide! I haven't had a lavender mocha since my many trips to my fave local shop in Seattle so of course I had to order it.  Did not disappoint! I loved loved their lavender mocha! I also asked for pastries, which she then preceded to tell me that since it was my first time, I get a free one. Woohoo!!! I ordered the blueberry scone which was fresh and ginormous! It was very delicious! All-in-all, this was the perfect visit with delicious coffee, a delicious scone, and great customer service. I will absolutely be coming back, only next time, I'll bring some friends along to try my new favorite local coffee shop!",

The retro gas pump stations are still around, which makes it a charming spot.   Friendly staff, good coffee, surprisingly enjoyable cookies, and blasted AC (*this is key). They seem to host live bands time to time, so perhaps not the best place to study or have intimate conversations.",

CSC comes up with tons of reviews so of course I have to check it out. Just ordered a chocolate chip muffin and a caramel latte. Good lord this muffin is delish!!! Crisp on top, full of chocolate chips and so moist in the middle.    Now I wasn't expecting anything other than the normal caramel latte, but the first sip I knew it was going to be in the top 10 lattes I've ever had.     Very cool atmosphere with awesome paintings and comfortable seats.  If I ever come back this way I will definitely come back to CSC!!",

Super friendly staff.. did I say super .. yes super friendly staff who try to make it a point to remember your name and even your drinks. I have only been here the mornings and early noon so I'm not sure if they have anything going on at night/ evenings .   The drinks are great and they are more than willing to listen if you want your drink one way or another. The place is clean and cozy .. which in real estate speak means not the biggest ! :)   Free wifi , so yayy. Welcoming to anyone and everyone - more win.   The restrooms are crazy clean and definitely wins for the fact they are comfy and spacious enough to change your clothes in ! ( I come in from work at times and love that I can change my clothes here without feeling crammed )   Has a very pleasant wonderful vibe and that alone makes this place 5 star worthy and throw in that service it's like sprinkles on your fav cup cake - just can't be beat. If you live near by you have no excuse to go to star sucks - heck they even have a drive through !",

    "text": "5 stars. I'd originally put 4 simply because it was my first visit, but now on my second and this spot is great. I like to ride to good coffee shops ( in this instance on the Triumph rather than cycling on the road bike ), spent about an hour or so relaxing and reading a good book. Copper Star Coffee feels like it will be a regular spot for me. The patio area looks pleasant and I see myself spending some time out there as the temperature drops eventually. Inside is cozy and inviting.   The staff is very friendly and the service great. I tried the breakfast bagel, with egg, ham and American cheese: very very tasty, simple but right on. The Americano was just right though, looking back, I should have opted for the 16 oz vs the 12oz. All in all a great place to spend a morning, AND it's open early. I'm an early bird and with most spots downtown not opening until 7am or so for me, in the summer, that's just a bit late lol. Especially if I'm going to be cycling there from N. Phoenix.  It's just off of 7th Ave with a little parking area adjacent in addition to street parking.    So, I like this little shop located in a former service station quite a lot and look forward to more visits and to trying the variety of pastries, food and caffeinated  goodness.  Great little place.",

Not really a place to go if you're in a hurry, but it was fun to visit anyway. The iced mochas had a good mix of coffee+sweet+kick in the pants to keep you going.  Even though I didn't go in, they get 4 stars because the service was great and the associate that helped us was super cool. She was really helpful and efficient (we did not wait long at all) and wished us well. She also saw we were formally dressed for a wedding, asked non-intrusive, friendly questions and sent us on our way. If I were a Phoenix resident, I think this would be my go-to, solely based on a positive drive-thru experience!",

My first time to this coffee shop, I didn't get a complementary pastry which I read about in a few reviews, however, my tip amount on my credit card transaction was generously changed from $1 to $6. It could just be a mistake or it could be someone fraudulently overcharging manual credit card receipts to cushion tip amounts. Whatever the case, I can't get a reply or response from the management of the shop as phone calls and emails go unanswered. PLEASE REFUND THE TIP AMOUNT as generally I don't tip $6 for a cup of joe, regardless of how delicious it was. Maybe this review will get a reply. I'll copy it so I can post it on every site. Here is to hoping someone resolves the issue. Cheers.",

Yes, that's one specific vibe.  The owner, Bill, is often there and is a super friendly local guy.    The coffee is really good.  Both the brewed coffee and the espresso beverages are very smooth.  The coffee they serve is not roasted to death, so it isn't nearly as bitter or biting as the coffee served at a certain multinational coffee mega corporation we all know.    The pastries and cakes are out of this world.  They bake them in an open kitchen that you can see as you order.  I have never been disappointed by a single baked item I've purchased here.  There is sometimes live music.  The crowd is friendly and local.  Free WiFi.  Great spot to sit and read, socialize with friends, or go for a first meeting.  Can't get enough of it.",

She had gooey, sticky, and no doubt very, very sweet things to offer and it was all made right behind the counter in her open kitchen. Pointing to the high-rise layer cake on display I asked her \"is that real?\". \"Heck yeah it is, it's a peach cake.\". I didn't want to be an obvious glutton so I opted for the banana and walnut bread and ordered a blended coffee- both of which I was very satisfied with.

I was showing up pretty frequently last year: coffee's good and so are the pastries, but their wifi really sucked, which I needed to get homework done.  Came here again for the first time in nearly a year and some things have changed. Their wifi connection seems to have improved and their food portions have grown twice in size. I ordered a hummus plate, which was absolutely massive. I mean, that thing could have easily fed two or three people. I felt bad throwing it away. The coffee's still good.  My main issue comes from the music, though. I felt like I was shopping in Forever 21 or H&M, not trying to study for a class. How am I supposed to take reading notes when Jay Z and B.o.B.  are blasting above my head? I could only take it for so long before leaving.   Sorry, Copper Star, maybe we'll have better luck in another year.",

On the menu board, there were 3 post-its on it saying \"Out of Sandwiches\". They told us that they stop serving sandwiches later in the day, so we ate some where else. We decided to return the next day on Sunday, and the same 3 post-its were on the menu board again! We were not happy! We got there earlier than we did on Saturday. This time they told us that they are out of a lot of the items that are needed to make sandwiches, & they are awaiting their shipment. But they said that they could only make us Tuna Sandwiches...So we went ahead & got that. This left us with a bad impression about this place & will most likely not return.  In the mean time, while we were in line....2 more customers walked in & noticed the post-its, too....They turned around & walked out.  Apparently, they are losing business by not having there 'shipment'.  ...The tuna sandwiches were quite dry, & not much flavor...

There is an old gas pump out front which adds to the charm and there us some outdoor seating and a small fire pit for no burn days.  Inside the old garage beams and lifts are exposed, there is an opening door for nice weather and exposed block.  The comfy orange couches are great and I love the coffee cup cut out on the chairs.

As a former Slavebux employee, I loved the nice, laid-back vibe. It's small but has a nice variety of seating and a little patio. I also loved the variety of people I saw- the place is very accepting of PDA by same sex couples, for example. Definitely a hipster vibe without being too overly pretentious.  I tried a Cubano, which I hadn't had before. Definitely worth a try- it's espresso pulled with cinnamon and raw sugar, condensed milk, and steamed milk.   I see some reviews about the poor wifi. I dunno if that is still a problem but I have to say when the wifi went out at the 'bux there was really nothing we as the employees could do except call the cable company- yet me and the other baristas got bitched at nonstop. So I know it sucks but have some patience.  At any rate, I will be back just because it is a perfect walking distance destination for my study/coffee sessions.",

(The green tea chiller that Kelly had looked especially refreshing!)  Their soy latte was pretty damn good, and I ended up eating lunch at Copper Star also... who knew that they have fresh sandwiches and salads?  I wanted the egg salad but they were out of it.  Bummer!  I went with the curry chicken salad instead and it was tasty - as long as you like curry.  Not the best I've had, but it was convenient and edible.    Bill, Natalie, and Mindy took great care of our group... and since I ended up spending over 5 hours at the place, I was able to observe many of the other customers that came in and out as well.  It was a diverse group, and all friendly and cool. Great for people watching and working - the day flew by!  Thanks again to all of you that came out today, and to Copper Star for accommodating us.  See you soon, Copper Star!",

    "text": "I drive the stretch of 7th Ave between Indian School and Camelback very rarely, but running errands today caused me to take a slight detour. I'd never noticed Copper Star before until today, when I was driving north and noticed the retro gas station, and then word coffee, and then the word WI-FI in big letters on the window. I quickly made a u-turn and parked my car on the street (their lot fits like 2 cars at most).\r \r I walked in and the place was really open and airy with a kind of industrial loft setting. The barristas were real friendly and my iced soy latte was really good. Apparently Copper Star blends, roasts and grinds their own beans and they've done a quality job.\r \r I sat down in a corner seat and relaxed while The Shins were wafting through the sound system, which was fitting, as it seemed like a Shins kind of place. One of the barristas then went back into the open air kitchen to continue frosting freshly baked cupcakes. The crowd seemed local and quite a few people seemed to know one another as they walked in, so it seems like Copper Star's become a neighborhood institution. \r \r Cool concept - a coffeehouse in a converted old gas station. They also have a drive through window for all the folks on the go. \r \r All in all, a great find. I'll definitely come back again a few more times to see if it merits adding another star (or, perhaps, deleting one - which I'm hoping won't happen).\r \r ---------------\r \r EDITED TO ADD A 5th STAR: Coffee's been consistently good since the first time. And a couple weeks ago I reverted back to being 5 and had a chocolate-frosted cupcake with sprinkles and I contently went back home and watched 3-2-1 Contact and Voltron. Thanks Copper Star!",

    "text": "Copper Star is a great example of adaptive use in the heart of the Melrose curve. Who would have thought that a building initially designed to provide fuel to cars would so work so well serving fuel to humans?  Their coffee is locally roasted and, while not my favorite, is well above average in Phoenix. Their drive-thru is a great feature for those mornings when I'm running late. For the coffee adverse, Copper Star serves chai, tea, smoothies, Italian sodas, and some unique drinks including a black cherry limeade. Foodwise, there is a wide selection of baked goods,including some of the best bagels. They also have decent lunch offerings, such as sandwiches and a tasty hummus platter. But where they shine is their 'home baked' cupcakes. (I've seen Mayor Gordon here on several occasions getting his cupcake fix!)   Despite being in a converted gas station/garage, the atmosphere is quite a bit more cozy than most of the other coffee shops in central Phoenix. While the sandblasted block walls and exposed ceiling let that building's industrial past peak through, this is offset by rotating art work and selection of comfortable (if a bit dingy) couches and easy chairs as well as small bistro tables and long 'work' tables to choose from. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the owner, Bill, is a great neighborhood resource. He can tell you anything and everything going on along 7th Ave.  All in all a good place to grab a coffee and cupcake,  meet a friend or get some old fashioned reading done. I can't recommend it for serious work requiring internet access, however, as the wifi access remains intermittent at best.",

Michelle helped me out, she informed me about the rotating artists that showcase their work there and just gave me a little history about the place. It looks like a great place to study, meet up with friends, or just enjoy a good bite with good tea/coffee by yourself any night of the week. They usually close around 9/10 which is quite convenient. For dinner,I decided on the hummus plate and I loved the variety of veggies that it comes with.  :) I actually went to the drive thru the next day tho and got to try their espresso, OMG soooo good. Got a double shot with an ounce or 2 of steamed milk (basically a flat white but some shops don't offer that) and it easily went up on my top 3 list. BARISTA in Portland has my heart forever on flat whites! Anyways, thanks Michelle for a wonderful time and thanks to the young lady who made my tasty drink in the morning!",

I like to order flavored iced coffees. They never over-sweeten--the taste of the coffee always comes through. I've also enjoyed their chai, and my mother-in-law enjoys their drip coffee.

    "text": "I chose Copper Star because of the good reviews on Yelp. It truly did live up to its reputation.   Lets start off with the decor. Its a converted gas station so that is just cool. The garage door is all glass now so it has great natural light. There are a couple of sofas, a few big tables for large parties and a few smaller tables. However there is limited seating overall because hey, old gas stations just weren't that big on the inside. There are a few outside patio tables with misters to keep the heat down but the misters on the right side of the door seemed to be leaking or something so sitting on that side would be like sitting by your yard sprinkler while its going off, effectively eliminating that side of the patio for seating options.   They have a good selection of coffee and non coffee drinks I had a frozen toffee first and a cookies and cream next. My husband had an iced chai. All of the drinks were super yummy, the cookies & cream being my favorite. If you want something sweet & caffienated then this is the drink for you. My husband said he really enjoyed his iced chai too. They had a good selection of pastry type items. We had the cookie brownie which was both tasty and monstrous in size. I saw an award up on the wall in which they were voted best cupcakes.   They do also offer breakfast and lunch type items, eggs, sandwiches and the like. While I did not partake this time I definitely would. They had a nice open kitchen which was clean and tidy.   The service was awesome! Everyone raved about the service in previous reviews and they lived up to it. Whatever they are doing in terms of hiring and training it is working. The staff is genuinely nice and seem to care about what they do. Kudos for that in this day of crap customer service.   The bathrooms overall were clean although the small trash can for putting towels in had begun to overflow and was in need of attention.  This is a good coffee place for everyone. The snob, the teen, the middle agers, retirees. No one would feel out of place here.  I drove 24 miles to have coffee there and would definitely do it again. Well done Copper Star! Well done.",
