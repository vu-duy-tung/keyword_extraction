I ordered the salmon entree the other day for lunch and although I enjoyed it I felt $28 was definitely overpriced I could've had the salmon on a Caesar salad and that would've been $22  I live in old town Scottsdale I can go anywhere in Scottsdale pretty much and get a good Caesar salad with salmon for $16-$18 max We also could not have a conversation without raising our voices as it was so loud in there and we have eaten there three or four times and the noise level is all the same though I know we had a 12:30 PM reservation for lunch this time around so we were in the middle of the noise for lunch but it was still just absolutely ridiculous  I also didn't appreciate that we were put in the side small table squeezed in between couples on both sides of us and because I had to raise my voice so my husband could hear me a couple next to us could hear everything that we said and the the man sitting to my left even commented on something that I said is if we were all there together for lunch which I found unnerving  I really didn't feel like we had any Privacy at all and I'm sure if we would've had a little more quiet in the place or at least not the noise level at the level it was I wouldn't of had to raise my voice and my neighbors to my left would not of heard our conversation  I don't know how that can change  I'm sure it's the way the building was built and the acoustics of the building and it is unfortunate I doubt that I am the only person that feels that way and in fact my husband and I are sure that we are not in the minority when it comes to noise pollution We do like the coffee shop area and that short menu and have frequented that as well We will probably return but try to pick a time when the volume is turned down and I'm not sure when that will be  But not going there for lunch on a Friday - definitely the wrong time if you want to have a conversation It would have to be a special occasion for us to spend that extra money",

For drinks, my wife got the breakfast smoothie and I went with the Cleo. Both great. For food, I ordered the fried chicken and biscuits. Homemade biscuits with fresh fried chicken and topped with an egg. Perfect dish, not overwhelming. The homemade biscuits made it. We sat on the patio which was great as well. Overall, great place for breakfast/brunch.",

Our server Cameron was kind, patient and very helpful.   We started out with the Parmesan popovers that were served with two kinds of butter-WOW!! I had the veggie scramble just filled with delicious veggies. Another friend had the carrot cake pancakes which she said were to die for, and another friend had the egg white omelet which she also enjoyed. The whole experience was great!",

    "text": "So I've been to the Henry once before. The last time I went was on Easter for brunch. Shortly after I finished brunch and got home, I puked everything up. Pretty sure I got food poisoning.  Anyway, I was hesitant to go back because of this previous experience, but I'm glad I did. I think I just found my new goto coffeeshop to work at! This place has a ton of (cute) seating and lots of lighting. It also isn't too loud or too busy. Parking was also quite easy.  The woman who took my order was super friendly too! I asked her what she would recommend and she made a couple of different suggestions, making sure to take the time to explain the difference between each of the items. I ended up getting the Dropout with half a pump of caramel and half a pump of chocolate, iced. It was the perfect amount of sweetness!  I may not ever go back to the Henry for the food, but I'll definitely go back for the coffee and ambiance!",

The decor was on trend with its combo of old and modern fixtures and furniture.  I kicked off with a Pineapple Pisco Sour, and was super impressed at the restaurant emblem in the foam!  It was a delicious version of my favorite drink from our honeymoon in Peru.  I decided to have soup and a starter for my dinner.  The soup that day was a chicken tortilla soup, which had fresh avocado in it.  It was tasty and it the spot, as the evenings in AZ were in the low 40s when I was there in January.  I also had the Short Rib Potstickers, which were excellent.  They tasted fantastic!  I had a bite of AC's Prairie Breeze Cheddar Popovers too, which were super soft on the inside.",

I am a huge fan of your happy hour but I have to dance around like some big vulture hawk in order to get a seat at the bar.   Your food is wonderful. Shirt rib anything, I've both the pot stickers and the short ribs and each time ended up ordering another round. The chopped salad is what you would expect (turkey, ham, egg, bacon, white cheddar, tomato) but the fat-e-o buttermilk dressing is deceivingly light and creamy tasting.  The fat-e-o buttermilk fried chicken sandwich should be taken off the menu so I could restrain myself from pigging out on it every time. They fry the breast and then slather it in havarti cheese & bbq mayonnaise.  Help me now! Next time I will jog from my house to make all those calories make sense (and I live far)!",

It's really big on the inside with couches, dining tables, a bar and whatnot and the outside eating area is spacious as well.   I didn't get to try anything on their menu besides the dessert and some drinks so I can't really give a review on how the food is, but what I did order it was very enjoyable. I had the chocolate peanut butter molten cake with ice cream and my friend got the bread pudding I believe, both tasted really good and not overpowering on the flavors, worth the price and I would order it again. The drinks I ordered on the other hand.......not even gonna go there because I'm not that big a fan of alcohol so I can't give an accurate review of it. But I'm sure that majority people who orders a drink on the menu like it.   The waiter was very nice, helpful and prompt, even when requested another drink because I didn't like first one I ordered. I would definitely come back to try out their food menu because I liked the set up so much!",

Then it began to downpour and we had to ask to come in. No one offered. The staff acted confused on why we'd want to come inside and the manager never showed his or hers face to apologize. On top of everything, not even our server apologized and he is extremely rude. I will not be back.",

The first time we were treated poorly was on my birthday. We sat on the patio with my family and waiter seem very upset she had to wait on us. Until she saw I reacted to her poor treatment she changed her character. Next time we visited was also on my husbands birthday, we had made a reservation and still had to wait over 30min. To be seated. Then once we ordered we waited over an hour to get our food, which were mostly sandwiches. We spoke to the manager and we understood why waiters had poor characters there. He was not too polite. We have not been back since then.",

    "text": "Cheers to another awesome Fox Restaurant concept. Upon my first step into the big blue building I immediately fell in love.   The atmosphere is perfect with a mix of tasteful urban, east coast, and early 1900 era decor. It's very open and inviting on the inside with endless visuals that hold your attention.  I could see my self here in the mornings for my ritual intake of caffeine, lunch, or with friends getting lubricated for a night out on the weekend.   I had the arrogant butcher coffee, a nice drip coffee infused with espresso and dark chocolate, delightful.   The avocado bread simple and tasty, followed by the French dip which I found delicious.  Welcome to the neighborhood Henry, I'm all in!",

The food is delicious (truffle fries), the staff is phenomenal, and I love their patio.  The atmosphere is classy and laid-back...definitely not stuffy or over-the-top.

A buffalo herd of us arrived for breakfast club to sample the wonders of the morning menu. Thank you Seth, and everyone at The Henry for rocking it out to help all 15 of us!  As I have been known to write marathon reviews here's the skinny: + fancy looking joint (stunning design) supports a range of dress style + incredible drinks w/the best bar stools in history + coffee bar area, kid friendly + outdoor patio area complete with misters, heat lamps, comfy seating and umbrellas  I'd eat the breakfast burrito again in a heart beat. In my current food coma I really can't describe what is in it. For that I fail you. Read the menu. I'm sorry. My table mates agreed when they sampled that it was gosh darn good. I had planned to take the other half home for lunch. That did not happen. I'm sporting a buddha belly right now.  The fried chicken with over easy eggs and gravy s not a low calorie item. Whatevs. Just get it. You'll thank me. I was envious of the other people at my table. Thank god they threw some forkfuls my way. I was also a fool for not ordering pancakes. Heaven help me. I'd probably lick that plate. Manners? What are they for? Live for today!  I'd really like to take a nap now, however, the gym calls. It's not too late for you heathens to hustle over for some brunch/lunch action. Get it!",

When I showed up, unfortunately there was a struggle with getting the patio table with the hostess. She stated that it couldn't be \"reserved\" and she could only offer the inside. Interestingly, there were at least 3 other opens tables were opened in the patio as we finally were seated outside. Moreover, one of the table had a \"reserved\" sign on it. It was really a confusing system. It was rather a frustrating experience! If this fox-concept place keeps this up, I can also help to spread the words...There are many other places can offer the same, patio, good food and drinks.",

They're so tender and delicious, it's not right.  They have a great burger, a flavorful and satiating Turkey French Dip, and a Butter Poached Lobster salad that'll make you tune out your lunch/dinner date.

The Henry is one of his newer restaurants and is well received judging by its popularity and wait times. Fortunately, I was able to easily snag a seat at the bar and watch the restaurant in action.   It's spacious with couches indoors for lounging, a large outdoor patio, and a coffee shop. The servers are helpful, friendly, and quick to provide suggestions if you need. I was able to stay a while without feeling rushed by anyone to leave.   I started the evening out with an Old Fashioned made with Angel's Envy, which was not too sweet and beautifully presented. They have a good whiskey selection and one of the bartenders gave me a tasting of Orphan Barrel rye on the house! Their food menu has an array of options from small bites to steaks. I ordered the avocado toast and a side of brussels sprouts. The brussels sprouts were fantastic- crispy, fresh, and flavorful. The avocado toast was decent but lacking in a certain spice and would be better served with goat cheese over queso fresco. I rounded out the night with a delicious Regan's Final Word (rye, chartreuse, luxardo) to complete the experience.   I really appreciated the great service at the Henry and the overall atmosphere and would definitely go back in the future.",

It has been a REALLY long time since I was this impressed with a restaurant. The service, drinks, food, atmosphere, EVERYTHING was fabulous! We started with the short rib potstickers and they were splendid (and that's saying something considering we know good beef). The truffle fries were a good addition to the appetizer selection! Our waiter was friendly, attentive but also let us enjoy our company without over doing it. The main plates, from the bolognese, scallops, and broccoli cheddar tortelli, were delicious! Highly impressive! We ended the night with the chocolate peanut butter molten cake, devine! I can't say one negative thing about The Henry!

We went with another couple, to celebrate his birthday. Our server made the evening enjoyable, simply by her incompetence providing laughs.  He ordered a bottle of champagne , and was served a glass. We pointed it out,, and she tried to tell us that we did not order a bottle. Well, we all heard it, and she was wrong. She relented, and said she would go get it, and tried to take the glass away. We all know it was going in the trash - so when we told her not to take it away and she said she'd add the glass to our check, we all looked at each other, then her, and asked her to leave it. She agreed, and said she would have to charge us for it. I was flabbergasted. Ultimately her coworker witnessed the event and took it off for us.  The entire evening went like that. It was like she couldn't agree with us on anything. She closed out the evening without disappointing our expectation of more poor service and argumentative behavior.  We asked for dessert menus. She told my wife that the bread pudding was amazing, and practically melts in your mouth. My wife said, yes, I'll have that. Our friends ordered an espresso. She said she'd be right back with the espresso, and dessert menus, so we could see if wanted to order anything.  We said, we just want the previously ordered bread pudding, which unbelievably she didn't agree that we had just ordered. In fact she got confrontational about it. I'm sorry, but are we not the customer?  One star, not going back. Thanks Henry!",

We had the meatball soup and kale and garlic dip. The soup was very good, and the dip had an overpowering lemon taste, which I was not a fan of. As an entree, my boyfriend and I had the Korean Skirt Steak and the Short Rib. The Korean Skirt Steak was delicious, and it comes with rice that's a bit spicy but very good.  Overall, it was a great dining experience.",

    "text": "4 Stars for the design, ambiance and service... 3  for the food.  Not feeling like rounding up to 4 starts .   A friend and I came in on a Saturday evening, we arrived and were seated in the main dining room quickly.  Our first visit we were determined to try and share a variety of dishes to get a good feel of the menu.  We started with drinks I ordered the Ginger Cooler (which was bold and flavorful).  Going for a 3-4 course affair we started with the popovers (lured in by the ham butter on top of the fact they are popovers, I am a big popover fan).   They came out quickly ...I am not used to this for popovers. Leary I touched the popover to find it barely warm.  The plate they were served on seemed warmer.  We advised the waiter and they brought out (just as quickly) another pair.  A little warmer.  Ok, I guess this is their thing.  The ham butter was good but the herb butter was our favorite.  The rich full flavor of the butter and the distinct fresh herb flavor really picked up the warmish popovers.    Next we tried the Roasted Brussels Sprout Cesar.  The Cesar dressing was spot on, with a lovely present anchovy flavor and was not like a creamy ranch like dressing as done in so many places anymore. I wished for a bit more brussel sprout and a little less romaine lettuce.    The main course was tough to decide upon.  We finally went for the Gemelli pasta with bacon.  Now this was a total comfort food, pasta cooked to perfect al dente, rich smooth cream sauce and large chunks of ham/bacon.  I would go back for this.    When it came time for dessert we asked the question, (based on what we had thus far which we overall considered just ok),\"Was it worth getting/trying? \"  We decided to pass on dessert.    We absolutely loved the decor and ambiance, while i do see myself returning in the future it is not something I am rushing to get back to all that soon.",

    "text": "I find it hard to believe that The Henry has been open two months.  My experience there this afternoon was more like a soft opening experience.   I arranged to meet some friends at The Henry to try it out.  Being a big fan of Fox Restaurants my expectations may have been high.  Combined with the fact that there has been a lot of news about Fox going national AND the corporate office being upstairs....  I was really expecting something like Olive and Ivy +1.   Finding the front door and hostess station at The Henry is your first challenge.  They are both well designed to cause confusion.  I managed to wave down a server and ask where the front door was and she let me know I had just entered it.  Imagine my confusion as I was standing in the middle of the dining room.  She then pointed out the hostess stand where 5 bored looking servers and 4 confused hostesses hunched over something on an old office desk.  I followed an equally confused couple to the crowd and listened as it was explained where HH was served.  The couple walked away after having a minor melt down similar to the one I felt brewing, as did the servers, leaving me alone with 2 of the hostesses that (not realizing I was not with the couple) turned back to their desk and completely ignored me.  This after telling the couple it was their first day.  Listen ladies... first rule of the hospitality industry.... be hospitable??!     Once I stepped up and overheard them talking about their outfits I interrupted to let them know I would sit on the patio with my 6 friends (which she had JUST explained to the couple was open seating).  I witnessed SHEAR PANIC on this young womans face as she stammered out: '\"Six?!... Ummmm.... The server should be here soon for that area I'll see if I can find them if you want to wait\"'.  Really?  Its open seating, its not staffed, I've been in this restaurant for 15 minutes now, and I havent spoken to a single person I didn't initiate conversation with.    I eventually found a seating area inside, 1 foot from another couple, on my own, and we had our drinks.  HH is drinks only, and kind of weak at that.... $2 off well and $5 beer from 4pm-6pm M-F, no food specials.  Not that there is any munchy food on the menu... its all pretty frou frou, as is the crowd: botox be thy name.    I've heard over and over that the food is amazing, but I couldn't care less.  If you cant make me feel welcome and blow me away with atmosphere and HH specials there are about 1000 other places in the area code that can,  including North Arcadia where we had a amazing dinner after hastily departing The Henry.  Do yourself a favor and wait another 6 months for The Henry to work out its growing pains.",

    "text": "This place has been in East Phoenix for quite a few years now. It's still busy all the time. Which means it's pretty good.   My friend made us reservations for lunch. Because, she said it so busy it's the only way to get a good table. We had reservations for 1:00 but, we still had to wait about five minutes which was fine .  We got a nice table against the wall.   They have a huge menu for drinks. Which is what a lot of new places do,push the alcohol. However, The Henry also have a lot of choices for nice drinks with no Alcohol,but, still fancy and flavorful. Love that.  The food here is absolutely divine. It is hard to choose what to get. For an  appetizer my friend chose the Smoked Norwegian Salmon. It came with potato hashbrowns and arugula for $14. It was great. My friend ordered  roasted chicken with rosemary. Skinless and boneless I had a bite and it was great .  I got the prime rib sandwich which came with horseradish Aioli. We both got sides of brussels sprouts, really good.  Of course this was far more than we could eat so we took some to go. Then we got dessert. Since were celebrating my birthday.   Chocolate peanut butter molten cake.  It came with banana gelato.  As well as the Pear Basque Cake,  that came with Pear sorbet , which is the best sorbet I have ever tried .   If you're having lunch or dinner here I would suggest giving yourself plenty of time so You can enjoy the ambience and the food. The parking lot is packed. However, they do have complimentary valet service which is nice.   The restrooms are located by the coffee shop. Yes, there's a coffee shop located inside the restaurant as well. So if you just want something quick and relaxing there's that. They do provide the upstairs for private parties. So it's quite a all-in-one fine dining restaurant.",

    "text": "This review is hard for me to decide what star rating to give, and it might be long but I'll explain.   First - the place is an IGers dream! The decor is amazing and the vibe is airy fresh and welcoming.   A group of 6 of us called on a Saturday morning and were able to get a reservation around 12:30. The place is huge but its obvious its a weekend busy spot. Our first impression was great. We were waiting for our table and greeted by someone who took our drink order while we waited.   Their drinks are AMAING. I got the Pimms & Rye and it was so delicious.  We were seated and this is when it started to go downhill. After sitting drinking and chatting we realize its been 25 minutes since we were seated. Our drinks are gone (or dwindling) and we haven't even put an app in. Thats insane so we sent someone to find out what was going on.  A manager came over apologized took some drink orders an order of fries and told us they were on her. GREAT - things should pick up, we thought. Wrong. Another 30 min later we still hadn't ordered food. So by this time we are like WTF? How could the server who was chastised for taking so long disappear again! We start to realize we're not the only ones, tables around us are getting up to order drinks from the bar, request new servers and we join the ranks. After we request another server the manager comes back out, apologizes again and gets another round of wine for the table. We place our orders and things start to go a little smoother- but at this time i'm like \"what type of establishment is this\" As we're enjoying our drinks we hear another table behind us getting an explanation from their new server, apparently there had been an issue with an employee and many were scrambling trying to cover additional tables. After hearing this we became more understanding. However I'm still confused why no one offered an explanation any one of the three times we had to get up and request service. We assumed it was just VERY bad service.  That story aside the food was delicious. I got the flower child scramble and could have literally licked the plate. In the end the server caught up and was very friendly. Total we were there about 3 hours but it was a nice day to sit outside. I would def go back but hope that no other servers quit during shift.  TL;DR - a server walked out while we were there and we did not get great service. Instead of explaining the situation the manager kept acting like she couldn't fathom why we weren't getting service, but if she had just explained the situation we would have been way less angry. Food is great.",

Food wise: we ordered three things - the guac (I shall call it gringo guac bc it had corn and persimmons in it wtf...). It was aight, but had we paid sad hour prices and not happy hour prices, I'd be bummed.  Parmesan truffle fries were yum city. I mean, how do you mess up that combo? The aioli and ketchup are best when you mix them.  Harvest bowl was also such a great treat and I'm pretty sure it's vegan. Love it.  My hubs said this about the beers: nicely curated beer list comprised of local and out of state craft brews. He had two beers and liked them both.   The clientele was a little too heavy on dudes in dockers with sweaters around their neck or bro vibes named Chad but overall, great time.",

Great service; all the staff was super friendly and helpful. The food was very flavorful and top notch. The one complaint I have is that the food could have been served a little warmer (especially the dessert).",

I made sure to make the reservations during happy hour so the adults could partake in some discounted refreshments. Wow!  Their mules were delish!  We all tried a few different varieties and they were spot on!  The best part, they were not watered down like many happy hour drinks and were $5. :)   The service was great!  She was very attentive and gave us nice recommendations. We ended up going with a few different plates and I sampled each. The quinoa tacos were yummy and the bolognese was fantastic!  My son ordered the Korean prime skirt steak... omg!  Fantastic!  Since it was my daughter's birthday, they sent a peanut butter molten cake to our table for free. Again, it was great!    We will definitely try this restaurant again. Amazing atmosphere, service, food, prices and the bathrooms were CLEAN!  ;)",

We had to move the table, chairs, and umbrella round in order to keep all us out of the sun and we did have some help from one of the men working.    Our waiter, Cody (we lovinly refer to as the Codster) kept us chuckling throughout our experience.  He began by asking if we had been before, which we all said no.  Mind you he started by saying his name and then asking us.  Once he realized we hadn't been before, you could tell he kicked into the script and again introduced himself and ran down the script telling us about the homemade food, options, etc.    Although we loved the guy...he got side-tracked so many times during our 2.5 hour lunch.  Yup...we had not intended to be that long but we had to wait for this, wait for that, remind about bringing this or that.  And at the end when we had the checks but needed change for tips, he got lost with that as well.  Overall, our experience was great!  The food is excellent, expensive, but you are getting what you paid for.  High quality, fresh ingredients, high chef quality stuff for sure.  We started with the white truffle fries, which we shared.  So darn good.    Dishes ordered were the kale and quinoa salads, patty melt, and brussel sprout salad with steak.  I also ordered a side of the orzo, which was so tasty and creamy.  Everything we had we loved and although pricey, we will come back for special occasions.",

My friends and I had brunch here on a Sunday morning- we came around 11 and had to wait approximately 45minutes for a table (get a reservation!), but it was well worth it.   We came to The Henry for the Bloody Mary's we heard so much about. The cart was a new experience- they had 8 kinds of flavor-infused vodka to choose from and garnishes like bacon, celery, olives, pickles, pickled onions, etc. It cost us about $10 per Bloody Mary and they were bigger than I expected them to be. They were DELICIOUS! One of the best Bloody Mary's I've had (and they're my favorite drink)   I'd recommend this spot for brunch but I would definitely advise reserving a table ahead of time. If not, though, you can grab a coffee or donut and sit in the lounge and relax!",

I would highly recommend making a reservation, especially if you're coming on a weekend. It's been extremely busy all three times I've dined. Ours was for 1pm but they were running late so we didn't get seated until 1:20pm. We started with Prairie Breeze Cheddar Popovers & an Everything Bagel with cream cheese. I ordered the 2 Egg Breakfast & I also got to taste the Caramel Apple French Toast & Huevos Rancheros. Portions are great & every single bite is delicious. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the bacon was! It seems to be pretty basic everywhere I go but here it was outstanding!",

    "text": "The braised short rib was cooked to perfection. Easily consumed without a knife. And the glaze that comes with it was delicious. The salmon dish is also cooked just the way I like it: crispy on the edges and tender throughout.   The truffle fries with parmesan are just okay, a tad soggy to me. Compared to everything else the fries seem kind of like an after thought.  The artichoke toast is great but a bit on the small side (it is an appetizer after all). The peanut butter chocolate lava cake is rich and decadent, we substituted the salted caramel ice cream for the banana Gelato and thought it went perfectly.   The drinks are good here, I recommend the Old Fashioned and the Pinot from the Willamette Valley.",

If food came out on time it was either cold or super salty. Five out of six dinners served together... Say it ain't so! Rude manager that thought she was better then her job to please others.

The decorating was superb, concrete walls with embroidered mid century sheer drapes. Krystal set up the bar and served us a couple champ bottles requested for my birthday. Vanessa, Emily and Ali are the best barista's, after only a couple visits they already knew my usual order. I will continue to be a fan, working from this location has been a blast",

But here's why I want to give them 10 stars: I left my wallet on the bar. I called them in a panic from the airport and they had already found it. I had 20 minutes to get checked in and was about to miss my flight! And the manager jumped in his car and had my wallet to me 15 minutes later!!! They saved me and really cared that I was about to be stuck! I am grateful to them forever. Cannot wait to go back next time I am in town. Run, don't walk to this restaurant and leave them big tips and great reviews! They deserve it!!! And try the quinoa tacos!",

I always scope out the yelp reviews before coming, because as a veggiesaur I like to know if I have options or if I should pregame it prior to coming to I'm not starving.  I had a bit of an inward struggle trying to decide between the seasonal vegetarian salad and the medallion quinoa tacos and SO glad I went with the tacos. They are a little small, so if you have a huge appetite, I would recommend getting a side to go with, but for me they were perfectly sized and delish. Great flavor and mix of crunchy/soft ingredients.  The atmosphere is super cool as well, I am loving the walls in here!!  Oh and a small tip if I may, make a reservation on open table prior to your visit to ensure ultra fast seating during the lunch hour. :)  I will be back for brunch in my near future because I saw many great mouthwatering pictures on good ole yelp that are making my stomach growl!",

So, to celebrate my final session, my mom and I went over there for a late lunch.   This place, at least that day, pretty much embodied a healthy cross-section of Arcadia residents. First off, it was really crowded with, I'm betting, people who are Sam Fox loyalists. To avoid a wait for a table, we agreed to sit at a communal table. We ended up next to a group of five. They looked like they had just gone hiking or the two 30-something sisters went to yoga and the rest did something healthy and active. The patriarch in the group was going gaga because he had seen Sam Fox himself on his way inside and got up the nerve to say \"How's it going Sam?\" LOL. There were also a lot of well-dressed business people even though it was that slow week between Christmas Day and New Year's. There were also a lot of people with groups of kids--all well-dressed but a bit hyper of course.  I really like the decor set-up. It's very modern but industrial. There's a bicycle on the staircase that's behind the coffee bar area but not sure if it's someone's actual bike they use or it's there to give urban \"street cred.\" You can go in just for the coffee bar that offers pressed juices.   As for the food, I was really impressed by the cheddar popovers with the smoked ham butter. They were so airy. I felt like they didn't fill me too much before my warm salmon salad arrived. That salad is probably the best healthy option. I couldn't believe how they combined pretty much every vegetable you hate as a child--cauliflower and brussel sprouts --but made it really flavorful. The salmon was cooked just right. So many times, restaurants screw up salmon. My mother had the C.B. and rye (housemade corn beef). The corn beef was tender but they really pile it on. It's a big sandwich. It keeps well for leftovers the next day, which you might need.   Considering the crowd of people who are very trendy and the wait, I may let some time pass before I eat there again unless it's on my way to another destination. But overall, I'd take someone here. There's a big enough parking lot that you don't have to do the valet.",

The most recent time, we ordered the popovers which is essentially this very light and airy biscuit. It comes with two butters, one of which was HAM BUTTER! Don't knock it till you try it guys, because it is absolutely delicious! For entrees, I ordered the branzino, my absolute favorite type of fish, and it was so good! Comes with a side of vegetables, everything seasoned and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend it. My boyfriend ordered the short ribs, which were delicious as well. Forget the knife! You won't need it, it is that tender!  We decided to opt out of dessert. But trust me, we were very tempted. The only downfall I would say are the portion sizes, for me, they are large enough to be content, but my boyfriend was still hungry by the time we left.  The decor is beautiful. There is a patio that is fully heated which is where we sat, since there was no wait. It was so pleasant! Perfect temp and lighting. Indoor seating is also a great choice. There is a bar and even a coffee shop on the side if that is your fancy! Love this place, I highly recommend it.",

We showed up without a reservation and there was an hour wait but we were able to be seated right away at a community table even though there was four of us. We ordered a bottle of champagne and one of my friends ordered a bloody Mary from the bloody Mary cart which was freaking awesome. The bloody Mary cart had six different infused vodka is to choose from and a bunch of garnishes. The guy making the bloody Mary was really cool and even went and got fresh bacon for my friend. My friend and I shared the caramel apple French toast and the avocado toast. Both were absolutely amazing. I also got a free dessert for my birthday, a peanut butter molten cake that was brought out with a candle. I will definitely be back again for brunch!!",

    "text": "Okay, I am usually skeptical of the hot restaurant owner in the city and his or her concept restaurants. However, I was truly wow by the Henry!  Five stars all around for ambience, service, and quality of food.  First, ambience. I love that it feels like the den or library in someone's home. The lighting is soft, the music is not too loud, and the seating is extremely comfortable.  I particularly liked that if you don't have a reservation and don't want to wait, there are a series of sofas that you can sit at and still order from the full menu.  Second, the service. Everybody that I encountered at this restaurant was delightful. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted with a smile.  When I asked where the restroom was, one of the hostesses actually walked me to it!  Not only was the server nice, he was well-informed! Often, my food allergies require the waiter to run into the kitchen, but this guy had the answer to everything about every dish.  Third, and most importantly, the food. Every single thing that I ate was delicious. I started with a simple house salad that had one of the most delicious ginger miso dressings I've ever tasted. But dinner was an even bigger treat! It's really hard to wow with chicken, but the Henry did it!  The perfect balance of crispy skin and juicy meat presented simply with rosemary and thyme.  I was also impressed with the side of apple and kale slaw. I normally hate coleslaw and mayonnaise, but this combination was perfect. The sweetness of the apple countered the bitterness of the kale and the creaminess of the mayonnaise and finished off very lightly.  No room for dessert, but I will definitely go back and report back to you.",

The open kitchen is really neat and it hosts a separate bar on the side of you just want to come in and enjoy a cocktail and watch the game.

You would think he would park me somewhere on the lot. Instead he just asked me to come back when it was not as busy later in the day. I waited 20 min for a spot to open and parked my own car. I had never dined in before so this was not a good start. However, I was greeted by a cheerful barista! She was helpful and placed my order. My husband comes here at least twice a week for lunch. He always raves about the service and menu! Myself and two others dined in. The manager Larry and all of the staff I encountered yesterday went above and beyond to accommodate my party of three! I had a rather complicated order some food for dining in and some to go. Larry and staff also took extra precautions with the food allergies for all three of us that were dining in.

I had been to the restaurant for AZ Restaurant week before, and loved the decor inside--I would decorate my house like it!  They have an open kitchen, but the noise it still relatively quiet.  Husband ordered a mimosa ($8) and it was probably the best I ever tried.  The mimosa had the right balance of bubbly stuff and fresh orange juice.  I ordered from the Bloody Mary Cart ($10).  There were several house infused vodkas to pick from as well as garnishes!  My green-chili bacon Bloody Mary was so good, my Husband also ordered  horseradish bacon one.  The coffees looked really good too!  Ordered the popovers ($7) to start, FANTASTIC!  It would be a great savory pastry with coffee if you came in for a light brunch.  The breakfast choices are on the lighter side, I ordered the Original Bacon Sandwich ($10) but substituted the bread for a croissant (great idea!).  My Husband ordered the New Yorker ($12), a corned beef omelet.  He said it would be better served as a hash with the breakfast potatoes and an over easy egg.  Overall, would recommend for the breakfast cocktails and the fair prices for breakfast items.  The only downside was our service.  The server seemed to be unfocused and \"in the weeds\" as she had put it to us.  She took our drink and appetizer order and left the large menus at the table.  After she delivered the appetizer, she left.  Before taking our entree orders.  We had very little space on the table to eat the appetizer!  After taking our entree order, we didn't see her again until she plopped the check on the table.  No waters, no drink refills, no asking hour the food was or if we wanted dessert.  Then she seemed really off put when I asked for a to-go cup of water (as I was thirsty!).  Since we had been there before, it might have just been a really bad Valentine's Day Service.",

If you come for brunch you need to make a reservation or the walk in wait is usually 40+ minutes. My husband had the LE Pig sandwich, which was recommended by the waitress, and it was good but it's a sandwich so there's nothing too exciting there? The sandwich itself is really big, more than enough for 1 person. I had the rancheros bowl and it was awesome! I love spicy foods and this was just the right balance of spicy. Their breakfast potatoes are worth noting, they're perfectly golden brown with tons of crunch. The atmosphere is really the draw to The Henry. The inside is huge with a chic industrial vibe, and the coffee bar adds a different aspect I haven't seen elsewhere.",

Little to no flavoring on the veggies. It needed salt, more sauce, and some of the veggies were raw. Others just under cooked. The peeps at the table had mixed reviews and that is understandable considering it's 4 stars. 4 stars for me always means sometimes they knock it out of the park and other times they just don't. Service was phenomenal and my friends loved their cocktails. Again, that Vegan carrot cake was awesome. But that bowl and some of the other now expensive meat dishes fell short.",

Great happy hour and great place to enjoy good company!",

My companions, however, could not stop raving about them.  The breads were freshly baked on a small skillet and topped with cheese and something else.  That was devilishly good.  I decided to be adventurous, since this is clearly a high-end place, to order Korean prime skirt steak.  It was wonderful.  The steak was marinated with some Asian sauce, not spicy, but a bit sweet, then grilled to perfection.  They pre-cut the steak so that I would just use the fork to eat the whole thing.  Tender and cooked just right (medium for me).  The wine bill was high, but that's probably because we have a wine snob to wonder the bests.  They were excellent.",

    "text": "Happy hour at the Henry is always a good choice- especially in April on the patio. HH short menu is only served at the bar, high tops and outside on the patio. Highlight items: guacamole- they have a fresh take with corn and tangerine mixed in with chunks of avocado and cheese. The chips are oversized and crispy; it's a great shareable item. The shrimp dish is well seasoned and comes in a quantity of four. Served with cocktail sauce and a spicy, mayo-based but well flavored sauce. We also ordered a toast that had artichoke spread on it- very tasty right out of the gate, but don't let it sit without eating it for too long. As for cocktails, they offer $6 happy hour wine pours and have a good selection! Angeline Sauv Blanc is one of my favorites and is on HH. They also offer a beer list, if that's your game. My company also ordered an Old Fashion, which looked amazing. Service was just decent, but I'll always come back.  Came back for brunch- wow, the California bowl is incredible!! Potatoes are cooked perfectly.. eggs, bacon, salsa, cheese- it's truly perfect!! Loved the hibiscus mimosas as well  will be back for another patio brunch very soon!  Went in for lunch with my manager this week, and we had an amazing experience! The dumpling appetizer comes with 6 pieces, and is the perfect way to start a meal. They're tender and seasoned well and are sitting in a delicious sauce. I ordered the tuna poki bowl, and I loved it. The sticky rice is well paired with the fish and other ingredients. My manager ordered a salad with brussel sprouts- we shared the sprouts, and they were next level!! As for coffee- do not pass up the Wildflower!!! Wow- can't believe I've gone this long without trying it! They use vanilla and chai to make this coffee such a treat!  I'm addicted to this place. Literally here at least once a week- cold brew is overpriced, but I keep buying. Went for the egg white omelet over a breakfast meeting- only concern was that it was served with guacamole when it said it was served with avocado. Turkey and white cheese filled. Left feeling satisfied but not overly full. Definitely lite for the $12.",

It is way better than expected. Like all Fox concept restaurants, the decor is beautiful and the staff is just exceptional. The brunch item selections are outstanding. There are several meat AND vegetarian options.  I chose the Harvest Bowl. The ingredient list is something to be impressed by and the taste  even moreso. The textural and flavor components are amazing....crunchy, soft, salty, savory, sweet....with every bite.  Their drink menu is also quite comprehensive for any taste of alcoholic beverage. Bloody Marys were a little too sweet for me but that didn't stop me from sucking it down! Their pastry selection is beautiful and they discount after 2pm to get rid of everything.  Another fantastic Fox concept. Reservations recommended....at least for brunch.",

For appetizers we shared truffle fries and Parker house rolls, the fries are addicting, we ordered a second round with or drinks.  The Parker house rolls are loaded with bacon and cheese and melt in your mouth.

I did a lot of research because we were going to be a party of 6, my family is very picky based on price and quality of food, and I wanted something where it was quiet enough we could all have a decent conversation, and something that I could get in reservations the day prior. The food and service were both excellent, pretty much everyone at the table got different items and we all shared and enjoyed every bite. I personally got the short ribs and subbed out the mushrooms for brussell sprouts and it was AMAZING. We were overall very impressed and the prices were reasonable. The Henry will not disappoint!",

There is plenty of natural lighting, high ceilings, and a modern feel. It is busy during lunch times, which is a plus in my book. I like to be in the presence of other people who are enjoying their food as much as I am. The patio is fantastic as well.  Great for social calls or business meals.

    "text": "Let me start off my staying I am NOT a big fan of Fox \"concept\" restaurants. I find them to be rather trite and pricey for the quality of food. I would not normally choose a Fox restaurant but my husband had a gift card so ....there you go.   I got off work a little early so we decided to try The Henry for their early Happy Hour (3:00-6:00 pm). We walked in to this large, open concept type of seating area. There was a coffee bar, sitting areas with wingback chairs and settees, dining booths and a regular bar. We stood there awkwardly for a long moment, looking for the host/hostess station.  When we were finally greeted the hostess explained Happy Hour was limited to the bar, patio or lounge area (comfy sitting areas) which was already full at 3:30! I spied a gorgeous fireplace on the patio so we were seated there   I loved this patio! The oversized brick fireplace had a nice fire going. There was intimate seating all around. I'm not on the tall side so I found the seats to be a little too deep to comfortably recline and relax.  Lighting overhead consisted of Edison light strings with misters attached! Very clever idea. Nicely trimmed shrubs lined the fence to block out some of the traffic noise and add to the intimate garden setting.   Our server, Lalo, was perfect! He was polite, friendly and didn't hover over us asking \"is everything tasting good?\" every 10 minutes! Gosh that irritates me. He just seemed to have a great sense of how long to leave us alone before checking in.   We enjoyed a couple of cocktails (hubs had beer) and took our time to linger over the menu.  I had the Fig & ginger mule and Peach & pomegranate mule. Both were good, but unfortunately the ginger beer overpowered the other flavors.  My husband was disappointed that they didn't have at least one whiskey-based cocktail in the happy hour menu.  Since I am so indecisive about meals, we generally go for a smorgasbord of appetizers to share. We ordered the white truffle parmesan fries, warm kale & truffle dip, Korean short rib street tacos and a burger to share.   Admittedly, each dish was delicious. The street tacos were my absolute favorite!! Sweet and spicy sauce and tender beef. The kale dip was served with warm pita and lavash crackers. It was quite rich. The burger was good and large enough for the two of us to share. I was actually full so hubby finished it all.   Overall, I enjoyed dining at The Henry. I would definitely go back for happy hour. The dinner menu is pricey, like all Fox restaurants, but happy hour was just right.",

We made reservations a few days ago really looking forward to coming here. I don't think I'd bother coming back. We then waited over 15min for the check then our server took our cell phone to use our gift card and had us wait another 10 minutes just for him to come back and say your phone locked up can you unlock it. We never got our coffee we ordered to GO at that point waiting 25min for a check was not worth the coffee we then get told he never put the order in for the coffee like it was our fault. Anyways we gave it a chance didn't work out . Food was JUST  alright not worth the time .",

We ordered a number of Happy Hour appetizers along with food from the restaurant week menu. Even the things that were not my personal favorite were still really good. Hands down the warm croissant bread pudding was my favorite item. It is one of the best desserts i have EVER tasted! A close second we're the Korean short rib tacos and the braised short rib entree. we ended up ordering 2 more taco apps, they were just that good! The only thing i wasn't overly impressed with was the cold shrimp appetizer. They had a good taste to them, but i think the size and price left me underwhelmed. I think too, they had been hyped up by a few people and i just expected more. I will say their cocktail sauce was tasty and i am not a fan of most cocktail sauces. Outside of that, everything was near perfect! I will definitely be returning to try more of what they have to offer. The servers were all extremely friendly, and fairly knowledgeable about the menu items. I just wish they had a location in the east valley!",

Don't get me wrong, it's tasty but I didn't expect a dressed croissant. I had more of a cinnamon roll vision. It is served room temperature. I also thought it'd be warm. Not disappointed. Just surprised.  It was buttery and flaky and sticky glory.   Also had the short rib potstickers at a friend's urging. They're delicious. But they are swimming in ponzu. Dab them a tad so you can taste the delicious filling.   He had the quinoa breakfast burrito. It came with potatoes - the menu is not clear about that. He liked it.   I had the harvest bowl and I added an over easy egg. The temperature confused me. The broccoflower and the Brussels sprouts were chilled. Roasted first, but seem to be leftovers from last night. They just surprised me among the warm elements.   He had coffee. I had juice (fresh).   Overall it was very tasty. But we ordered too much food.",

It's a bit chaotic being so big and noisy, and this may have caused the long pauses between wait staff visits.  Great cocktails.  Definitely recommend.

I've found the salads to be a little hit or miss in terms of how much I like them, but they change the menu fairly frequently so there always seems to be new things to try! I really enjoy the vegetarian quinoa tacos, and \"le pig\" on their brunch menu is very tasty! You also can't go wrong with their cheeseburger- very good!

However, when friends were in town last weekend, I couldn't wait to show off this spot to them and we headed over for lunch.  We started with the white truffle Parmesan fries with spicy ketchup and creamy truffle aioli, they were fresh and hard to stop eating.  For the table we got the Roasted Brussels Sprout Salad, Original Chinese Chicken Salad and the Kale and Apple Salad.  Clearly ladies were lunching healthily.  In all honesty, the food was good but we had expected that the Roasted Brussels Sprout salad would be full of shaved Brussels sprouts and not just a few halved into the salad.  When you list it as a Brussels Sprout salad, I think people assume it's more Brussels than romaine but that's only my opinion and I'm a Brussels Sprout lover, I eat them every week.  The Kale and Apple was well done but the Original Chinese Chicken salad was my favorite.  My friends were put off by the strong ginger flavor but I love ginger, the stronger the better.",

Service was excellent and our appetizers were very good.  We ordered the Warm Kale & roasted garlic dIp as well as heirloom tomato toast, loved both.    For entrees we ordered olive oIl poached Sea Bass and roasted chicken. The Sea Bass was fishy tasting and over cooked causing it to be rubbery and just bad, we brought it home for the dogs. The chicken was better yet still only average, Grassroots, Roaring Fork and FnB all offer superior roasted chicken. The Garlic potatoes were the highlight of both our meals.    Dessert was bread pudding, which we normally love, yet again we were disappointed average at best however the cappuccino was awesome.   Overall below average, and as we drove home we decided not to return. There are far too many excellent options in old town Scottsdale to bother with the Henry.",

The ginger black cod and the the caramelized scallops are my favorite meals to date, but still trying to have a taste of everything. They have freshly squeezed grapefruit juice with pulp and it is wonderful in a greyhound cocktail.",

    "text": "The Henry is a super cute place. I walked in and everyone was very nice. I came with a friend and the hostess informed me that it's going to be a about a 1.5 hour wait, but she gave us the option of eating outside in which we decided to do so. Our waitress came and was nice. She took our order and the food was out promptly.   As we were eating, small little bugs kept coming on the table. I get it, it's the middle of summer in Arizona. I tried to ignore or shoo them away, but then they all started coming on my plate and I immediately lost my appetite. For a place like The Henry, you would expect them to have a good exterminator to not have a bug issue.   The waitress came back and I kindly asked her if there is some sort of discount for having bugs all up in my plate. She gave me the, \"Are you F'ing kidding me look?\" We both looked at my plate and you could clearly see movement that was not from the food. She grabbed my plate in a very rude way and practically ran away. She came back with the check without an apology, dropped it off, quickly said that she took 50% off, and ran away if not quicker than the first time. My friend and I put the credit card down, and once again she was suddenly running a marathon. She didn't make eye contact and was clearly trying to avoid us at all costs. She was just rude in general all because I asked her about a discount on something you would think they would be understanding of. Even if she said I'm sorry we can't do anything about it, I would've understood because like I said, we're in Arizona. We still tipped her even though she didn't deserve it.    I just feel like this situation could've been handled differently. It's a very nice place, but she definitely ruined the good time my friend and I were having.",

Above a Davy's Gray and Carolina Blue patterned settee hang five frames of abstract art evocative of Damien Hirst \"spot paintings.\" Metal Tolix chairs border a polished wood table aglow under the lights of burnished antique two-arm table lamps. An emerald velvet booth extends to an entryway, which reveals an Arcadian terrace that offers a generous cue of shade. This American brasserie, dubbed The Henry, exemplifies a Roaring (Twenties) sophistication.  A remarkable accomplishment is discovered in the duality of the culinary cues at The Henry. Where classical dinners are supplied in the evening, contemporary breakfasts are enjoyed in the noontime. In his book, American Food: The Gastronomic Story, Evan Jones, the late food writer famed for his efforts to bring the winning accents of American cuisine to the fore, references this mealtime character called brunch. He traces its culinary heritage to 1930s' America. This dynamic that sees a harmony amid design and cuisine at The Henry is one that advances the restaurant as a space of fulfillment and gathering for family and friends.",

The ambience is like you're in a super chic yet comfortable living room and makes you feel right at home. Our server Alex went above and beyond to take care of my mom and me for our dinner. He was so knowledgeable, made great suggestions and was on top of everything at every step of the way. We have very restrictive diets but he was able to accommodate all our needs and the food was still INCREDIBLE. We started with the grilled and chilled shrimp which was a perfect light and delicious start to our meal. For entrees we shared the Chilean sea bass (omg) and the NY strip which was worth every penny- perfectly cooked and seasoned. Can't remember the last time I had a steak that good. Not a morsel was left of anything. They even specially prepared their squash to meet our needs. We were so well taken care of and left with such a wonderful memory of a meal. Can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "The best thing I can say The Henry has going for it is the venue -- spacious - and the customer service - friendly and accommodating.   But honestly, I wasn't impressed with the meal.    Even with a week and a half lead time, the only time available (for four people) was 4:45pm on a Friday evening.   We ordered the artichoke hearts for appetizers and our drinks.   My friend tried the drink recommended by our server - The Red Stiletto - but like the food, the name was way more impressive than the food actually tasted.   For the record, I honestly thought the artichoke heart appetizer was delicious, but we all joked and asked when the rest of the appetizer was going to be served.  I ordered the Chicken Gyro sandwich.   I'm use to the Greeks who pile on the meat.  This sandwich had very little chicken (which was pounded down to thin strips).  The flavor was great, but the pita bread was overpowering any meat or filling.  We ordered the bread pudding for desert.   It was good, but kind of dry.    So the short of this experience is this:   I can't find anything really wrong with this establishment. The restaurant definitely caters to Scottsdale (yup, I just stereo-typed) and to hipsters.   It's loud, but I liked the roominess of the room and the patio.  But after all the rave reviews, I was left under-whelmed by the foodie-experience.",

Very professional and the food came out quickly.  Drink menu was more geared towards men however.  I ordered a salad which was good but nothing special. The chicken was bland.

I preferred the herb butter (to the ham butter)  Chicken (main dish) with brussel sprouts and macaroni & cheese - the chicken was crispy, and a little dry.  The sides made up for it. The brussel sprouts were amazing. I might try to order several side orders the next trip. The Mac & cheese was deliciously creamy.   I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu.",

    "text": "My partner and I took a friend visiting from Los Angeles to The Henry for his and our first time, and all three of us loved it.  The decor feels like I imagine an expensive mens' club would look -- real leather banquettes and table lamps I wanted to take home (just one).  My partner had the pork chop (the thickest one I've seen since Dan Tana's in West Hollywood, easily 2.5 inches thick, I had the wild mushroom tortelli, and our friend (who is very hard to please) had the branzino.  All three of us gave our dishes top marks.    Even better than the food and the decor, however, was the service.  Our friend had driven in from Los Angeles that day and we had been running errands and cleaning house, so all three of us lay down for what was supposed to be a one-hour nap.  Unfortunately we woke up almost three hours later at 8:00 p.m.  We had planned to eat at The Henry, but when I checked their website I saw they stopped serving at 9:00 p.m.  I called and was told to come in, it wouldn't be a problem.  We showed up and people couldn't have been more gracious.  We never felt rushed, and when my partner and our friend wondered if it was too late to order dessert (by this time it was well after 9:00 p.m.) the chef reopened the kitchen and they got what they wanted -- no attitude at all.    My only caveat is that a co-worker and his partner had brunch there about a week ago and the partner apparently got a bad case of salmonella from undercooked eggs in an omelet, so I think I may avoid egg dishes if I go for brunch (or at least make sure the eggs are cooked through).",

As with many restaurants I've visited on the first day one can tell there were some wrinkles to iron out as far as food and service.  With The Henry was no such things as wrinkles on a cloth..  the food and service went far... far.. beyond my extreme highest expectations.  Allow me to point out a few highlights:  1. The entire staff (greeter, host and wait staff) were very friendly and made the place very welcoming.  2.  The food and service was impeccable.  The food tasted fresh and was of very high quality.  I had the 1/2 chicken and I never had a de-boned chicken before (only bone found was the leg piece - I almost thought I've already eaten the breastbone!). Also finished drinks and plates were promptly removed by literally the next waiter/waitress that passed our table, I doubt not that many wait staff returned to the kitchen with empty hands!  3.  The establishment also has a coffee bar section with ample seating to break out the laptop and surf the web with their blazing fast wi-fi (I performed a speed test and clocked the wi-fi download speed at 10+Mbps !!).  I noticed there were like 3 other meeting rooms with TVs next to the coffee bar area and not certain if they are open for general seating during non-booked times (as I found more plug ins in there for laptops than in the main area). I look forward to chilling out in the coffee bar area after work in the near future.  As with any of the foxrc establishments I've visited I've always experienced food and service to be far superior than other restaurants I've reviewed in the past.  Keep up the good work foxrc!   As for the person who gave this place one star, I would imagine you will rate The Henry 5 stars upon your first visit! :-)",

For starters, the grilled shrimp cocktail.... my goodness....it was the best I've ever had in my life.  It's definitely something you can't live without.  Grilled, smokey, and perfection.  Didn't need cocktail sauce.  I'm not a lengthy yelper but please try this place.  It's awesome in so many ways.",

I had a reservation for 6:30PM, at 6:34PM one of the managers came over and apologized and offered us a free cocktail. Around 6:45PM we were sat at our table.   The food was DELICIOUS (kale and garlic dip, brussel sprout Caesar salad, and Quinoa tacos). The service was great - food came out quick. Our server was personable. I will definitely go back soon. Nice job Sam Fox!",

The Henry would NOT have been my choice for burgers and I was very disappointed. The food arrived 26 mins after ordering making it just before noon by the time we were eating (good thing they didn't order breakfast). To make it worse, one of the girls burgers had a hair in it and therefore she didn't even eat it. I had been to The Henry before and thought it was the perfect place to take my daughter and her friends but I was incredibly disappointed. I will never return to The Henry, nor would I recommend it.",

Kids menu was great for my youngest who is usually too picky to eat for cheap.  Appetizers get a 10. Popovers were really good as we're the artichoke hearts.  Smoked salmon with potato pancakes is an appetizer but my wife had for lunch and loved it.  I had the quinoa tacos - something I've never seen on the menu and they were excellent.  We were too full for dessert, but will be back again and will definitely try it next time.  Brussels sprout Caesar salad was unique and something I will eat again.  Almost forgot, our server Monica was really awesome! (As was the rest of the staff!)",

Our lunch time meal of truffle fries, turkey French dip, kale salmon salad, and poached eggs with asparagus had been sitting quite a while before it was delivered to the table. Delivery time was about 50 minutes after ordering. So while it was flavorful, it was lower than room temp. We had hopes for finding a new place to add to our regular hangouts, Henry's likely will not make the list. It might be a good hangout for coffee during the day; that's for a future visit.",

The restaurant is in a good location, right off Camelback, with a gorgeous patio set and beautiful views of the comeback mountains. The service and the drinks were excellent. We started with the chilled shrimp as an appetizer. They were well seasoned just wish there were more. I think you only get 4 big shrimp for $16. For entree my husband had the braised short rip dish. It was delicious. I had their branzino. Not the best choice for me. Even though the fish tasted good, it was cooked well and seasoned well the side dishes didn't complement it well and that kind of ruined the dish for me. It came with some oats that tasted like plain oatmeal for me and 3 little pieces of cauliflower. Just not a good enough side dish for the delicious fish. For dessert we had their Panna Cotta and Cleo Espresso . The panna cotta came with grapefruit ice cream and cashews. It didn't really impress us and didn't think that the sorbet was the best complement for the panna cotta. Wish it had more fresh fruit and maybe a raspberry or blackberry jam. The espresso was really really good. We will definitely visit The Henry again",

I had the braised short rib & my fiance had the gemelli and black truffle pasta.  Both dishes were nothing short of exceptional.  Although I will say the gemelli has a slight bitter taste, from the red cabbage I think.  We also had desert. Peanut butter and banana for me and sweet peaches and Creme for Courtney.  Awesome as well.    Portion sizes for all the dishes were on the medium size.  Which I happen to like.

I'm not sure if it's because they are discriminating against a family dining with young kids, but it's unacceptable.

The views of Camelback mountain are spectacular at sunset, and sitting outside when the weather is nice or even a bit cool is great (outdoor fireplace)! I loved the inventive cocktails, but I have to say my favorite part was the lasagna in bechamel sauce. Amazing! My honey ordered the turkey sandwich with fries. The sandwich was adequate but nothing extremely memorable. However, dipping some of his fries in the bechamel sauce was heavenly! I'm tempted just to order the fries and see if they can whip up some of the sauce for me as an app on my next visit!",

    "text": "Reconciling after our Ingo's spat (see previous review) Companion and I stumbled into The Henry on New Year's Eve and were greeted by three men in tuxedos and women in elegant gowns.  Taking them for Maitre D's and Hostesses, I immediately tipped the one who looked like he was in charge.  He dutifully escorted us to two seats in the center of the bar.  Our bartender, Teddy, a cross between Nikki Six and late '70s Ronny Wood, informed me that the tuxedoed gent did not work for The Henry.  I was out a quick sawbuck.  Undeterred, Teddy poured Companion a mean Martini and a capable Coors Light.  (No Miller Lite, so loss of a star immediately). The Menu was divided into appetizers, which looked great, and main courses, which looked expensive and enough food for the massive Offense Lineman of the visiting Fiesta Bowl Teams.  Opting for smoked salmon and chilled shrimp, the food was tasty and filling enough for our needs.  Our attention turned to the atmosphere and people watching. The restaurant is cool and the clientele in the place was a combination of the hoi pollio, social elite, literary cognoscenti and hardened criminals.  Surely a good mixture for New Year's Eve celebration.  The evening moved on to champagne, served in a traditional glass and not a flute! (Stay Classy The Henry!) The crowd got bigger and more energized and very well dressed.  Stepping out to use the facilities, when I returned Companion's chair was empty, the tuxedoed crowd had left and the large limo parked in the front was gone. She had opted for a better celebration.  Consoled by Teddy and another Coors Light and running into my favorite The Henry person, Monica, I suffered through another sad New Year's Eve. HOWEVER, The Henry was a winner and I look forward to going again!",

    "text": "Went for breakfast today since the Henry is just down the street.  It is in a great location and the atmosphere is nice and service was good.  I came here hoping to find a good breakfast spot but was very disappointed. I ordered the spicy sausage scramble and what I received was different from the menu description.  The menu says that the scramble comes with Zucchini, spinach and onions.  Mine came with these but they also added snap peas, asparagus and corn.  I don't really like snap peas and the corn took away from the flavor of the dish.  I would not have order it had I known that they weren't going to follow the menu.     I asked the waitress about it and she said they don't put all of their ingredients on the menu.  I find that hard to believe since corn, snap peas and asparagus are listed on the other dishes.   Looks like I will have to keep looking for a new breakfast spot.  Hope Matt's big breakfast opens soon.",

Not to mention taking our order. A number of other servers went in and out with the other tables ariund us who were in the shade. This is after bad service from the hostess who ignored us. And scoffed at us when we had mors people than expected and sat a smaller party in a much larger table than they needed. The drinks took too long to get to us. And our second round of drinks were used in the same glasses as our first and had MORE ICE AND was practically all ice.  The waiter didn't ask us if we wanted to separate our checks.",

Tried the shrimp, artichoke, smoked salmon and brie appetizers - all were excellent. 4+/5  Tried the skirts on fire and the pork entree. Very tasty as well. 5/5  Mule mixed drink excellent! 5/5  Everyone loved this place(one of fox's best yet)  The decor and ambiance is perfect, the coffee bar is a plus (I hear business breakfast is awesome here- no waiter service but you can use the restaurant facilities...)   The booth tables are VERY comfortable...  I figure Mr. Fox would not disappoint in this restaurant which sits right below his corporate offices...  EXCELLENT SERVICE!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Btw, desserts were superb, and pricing is fair!",

    "text": "Memorial Day was my second try with this place. First time was great, Memorial Day was awful, they lost my business.   We ordered food from the cafe area, we asked about mimosas and were told to order at the bar. After grabbing our order number we hung out at the bar waiting for the bartender to knowledge us. She looked a few times at us, was actively busy and moving around but didn't ask us if we needed something. Of course we were standing there not eating and just looking at the bar so it was obvious we needed assistance. She finally asked after a few minutes what we needed, and we said two mimosas and she rudely said we don't open till 11 but said ah ok and rudely shuffled to get the mimosa. The drinks were good but just a hassle to get. We know they open at 11am for lunch but when we were told it was okay to order mimosa at the bar then why do we get rude service for it?   Once our food came out no one asked how we were doing or if we needed anything. Plenty of servers but no one acknowledging the customers. My Sausage egg scramble I ordered was watery and I was not impressed at all. I was disgusted with how it looked but by that time I was over this place and the experience that I didn't feel like standing in the long cafe line to complain. I wont be back again and since then 4 people have asked if I have tried The Henry, I gave them my honest review of it. They wont be going their either.",

The salad is served with dressing on the side, always a plus in my book especially because the greens aren't drowning and you can pick how much dressing you want. The popovers are light amd fluffy and herb butters flavorful. Also had a spinach type dip with lemony undertones with pita. Delicious. But to top it off ordered the chocolate hazelnut with bourbon cherries and brittle, called \"budina\".  Not overly sweet but a great end to a delicious meal. They also serve breakfast and lunch. Its a must on my list sometime.",

The menu is great with lots of options. I ordered a omelette, and it was good. We had a party of four, and we all ordered our beverages first, and by the time the food arrived our drinks still hadn't been made.

I had a large wildflower which was a vanilla based latte it was smooth and well made. The scramble was not that exciting for the price --forewarn the food here esp breakfast is a bit steep ...I would have liked the scramble to come with fruit and a piece of toast.",

    "text": "A popular place for brunch! The Henry was bustling with patrons both outside and inside on this sunny warm Sunday. The patio outside looks to be dog friendly as there were quite a few cute pups lounging with their humans in the shady areas.   The interior is casual and contemporary, with comfortable seats and nice tables. The menu consists of amped up versions of your standard breakfast favorites such as omelets and pancakes. I went with the Flower Child scramble ($11). The eggs were soft and a good consistency, and the vegetables plentiful and perfectly cooked. One of the vegetables (The asparagus I think) had a deep smoky flavor that was a unexpected but welcome addition to the omelet. The dish was served with some potatoes that were lightly crispy and perfectly seasoned.   It can get a bit noisy in the restaurant so it's not the best place to go if you want a more intimate quiet setting but for a lively Sunday brunch this is a great choice if you want to dine in the Arcadia area.",

We'd heard great things and were excited to be checking it out. Unfortunately all excitement STOPPED when we  found a 1 inch long black curly (hopefully facial) hair in our breakfast burrito. I brought this to my waiter's attention and she simply took the plate away and said I would be brought a new one. Waiter brought a new dish but by that time I had already lost my appetite. I'm pretty sure in any other restaurant the manager would have immediately come over and apologized on behalf of the restaurant for making me feel sick to my stomach. When we were brought our check for the full cost of the meal I was honestly surprised. The waiter told us about their rewards program and how we could get $10 off our next meal, I asked the waiter if she'd like to give us that discount now and pay for my burrito but she simply laughed it off and walked away. At a restaurant that boasts elegance and high quality service and food I found myself doubly disappointed today. Maybe the hair only comes with brunch entrees?",

The ambiance here is very unique. The interior decorating is so thorough it's down to the curtains. I was really impressed with the attention to detail spent on the ambiance. It flowed & worked. I never would've picked the florally upholstered chairs but they looked great with the robins egg blue pin cushion bar seats which were very comfortable for bar stools by the way.  We were a table of 6 and given a comfortable booth. We ordered a drink at the bar before being seated and I thoroughly enjoyed the Cabernet Sauvignon. The G Disruptor I believe was the wine maker.  I ordered the rotisserie chicken with, you guessed it! A side of asparagus & kale apple slaw. I infrequently order chicken entrees while out, normally stick with adding it to a salad but I felt compelled here.  It was the best I've had. Perfectly moist and tender. Not even remotely over or undercooked. The skin wasn't greasy either and the seasoning was mild but complimented the meat. It was also a generous portion size which I couldn't finish. It includes the wing. The asparagus was also fabulous, cooked perfectly. The slaw was fantastic and I'm so happy I ordered it. It wasn't sour like some can be, the kale was edible which is an art when uncooked and the apple flavoring came through. It was the right ratio of mayonnaise also, not too much, not too little. I hope to dine here again. It was a great experience minus the forgotten salad and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their entrees.   Oh and our table raved about the bread pudding. Hearty & heavy, but sweet and delicious.",

First, we called to make sure they were still serving breakfast, the receptionist corrected me and said we don't serve breakfast but we have brunch till 3:30pm! Great, it was 1:30pm that is perfect. We arrive and the lady tells us I'm sorry were not serving brunch but were arriving our transitional menu... we were thrown off but went with it! We sit down, my fiance orders a bottle of wine and we Ofer our food! Our waitress either was new or just completely rude, she kept asking us loudly \"I'm sorry, or excuse me\" a we were placing the order. It felt so rushed and rude... The appetizers are good... we wait patiently for our food... it comes out and we cut into the well done and medium well burgers and they were bloody. We sent it back, the one came back red again.. so we decided to order the steak skirt because mannn it was not being cooked right we sent my mother in laws burger back for a thirds time.. and finally it was ok! But honestly it was like the cook was trying to be funny like ok they want it well and burnt it to be damned! I honestly commend my fiance for still tipping our rude and out of touch waitress.. they offered  to take care of the bill and then didn't! We paid $100.00.",

    "text": "I usually have pretty great service with Fox Restaurants but this one was really disappointing. We waited 2 hours for a booth for seven people with a server who didn't seem pleased to get us drinks and took forever to check in with us. A few of us had to go to the bar to get drinks since he didn't come over for a really long time.  When we finally were sat, our server was not up to par. It took 10 minutes to be greeted and she seemed disinterested in checking on us. I'm not sure what happened because normally Fox restaurants are pretty good about service (I used to work for one and they were super strict with training us). We asked a few questions on the menu after ordering a second round of drinks and she had to leave and check on a menu item. When she returned she said the Bolognese was out of pasta but we could order with the kids mac and cheese noodles that aren't house made. A few of us were fine with that so while she took our order she must have had a realization that it didn't sound correct because she said she would be right back and then told us once she returned that actually the sauce was sold out, not the noodles.  The food was amazing (loved the Ahi dish) but we were disappointed the Bolognese was sold out at 7:30pm after waiting 2 hours to be sat. No managers ever visited our table and she didn't seem to notice, or care, that we appeared annoyed with the poor service.  4.5 stars for food taste and quality and 2 for the poor service. I've dined here a few times and never had great service so finally decided to write a review.",

My girlfriend ordered the ahi tuna, also tasty, my favorite was the short rib, AH! I should of ordered that. Again, all tasty!   Only issue was that they close at 9pm on Sunday and also charge a $2 cake cutting fee per slice if you bring your own birthday cake. (Womp)   Still a great experience.",

It pains me because everyone else on Yelp says it's so great but for dinner it is definitely only three stars with the service being the main issue. The service was just not good. Our waiter's name started with a B I don't want to single him out too much. He seemed like he was either very new or was just very distracted. He came to the table said hello to the other three while I was in the washroom and then didn't come back for well over 10 minutes. When he did come back he took drink orders for the other three and never asked me about mine and left the table before I could say anything. Then it took 7 to 8 minutes to bring the water that was ordered and he brought the wrong waters, he didn't bring the other three drinks at that time either and then left to get the correct water and then came back a separate time with the first three drinks. Then he came back another time after he realized he never took my drink order. So now we've seen this guy about five times and he still hasn't taken our food order and I still don't have my drink. It was beyond strange. As mentioned above my ahi tuna and green curry rice was really, really tasty. The portion size of the tuna was good, the green curry rice was full of flavor and the broth that was around it, in the low sided bowl in which it was served, was delicious. It is pricey at $29 but that's what you have to pay for good ahi tuna at a popular restaurant. One of our table mates got the short ribs which from the statements he made seemed like he enjoyed very much, the other two got the pasta Bolognese.  As stated in my earlier review this place is much better for brunch, and the coffee and bakery area within the restaurant is stellar. But this review again is just for dinner and the service we had on Friday night.",

It came served with breakfast potatoes that were nice and not greasy. Their food is all fresh and sourced from the area; they're also very accommodating to food allergies.   Venue: It's a beautiful open building with wooden tables and comfy booths. They have an outdoor patio area, a coffee bar, a lounge to wait or eat, and a dining room.   Experience: We did wait 20 minutes after our reservation time, but the service was attentive after that and we were able to wait in the lounge which was very comfortable.",

And forget the a basic mimosa, they typically have other options from you to choose from. They are usually really busy, so be sure to try and get a reservation in advanced. I like to use the yelp app to make my reservation.   I love getting the flower child scramble, it is an all veggie scramble with home fries style potatoes. And it's just the perfect amount of food. Not over stuffed and it still hungry.   Instagramable food, drinks, location and sign.",

    "text": "Took our out of town guests here last night.  It has a nice vibe inside but a little noisy.  My husband started out with an old fashioned which was good but pricey and our guest had a grapefruit spritzer which was blah and unflavorful.  She ended up sending it back and got a pepsi instead.  The spritzer was not refunded.  On to dinner.  Between us, we had the roasted chicken, a hamburger, the korean steak and the salmon.  All the meals were adequate but not exceptional except for the korean steak which was very tasty although part of the steak was full of gristle and part of it was cold.  All sides are $7.  Our guest ordered a baked potato which she ended up sending back because it was so cold, the butter which we waited 10 min for wouldn't melt.  We waited at least another 10 min for another baked potato which was hot but now unwanted because we had already finished our dinners.  We all shared (meaning we had one small bite each) of the peanut butter molten dessert which came with a cookie scoop sized dollop of ice cream.  The desert was a tiny muffin sized brownie with melted nearly unsweetened peanut butter inside.  It was not particularly memorable.  Basically, I was disappointed in the entire experience for the price of a $200 meal.  Service was a bit slow, portions were small for the price especially since they did not include much of anything except the entree, and the dessert disappointing and tiny.  I think I will opt for a better dinner at the Collins, Macintosh or Wally's next time.",

    "text": "I think I'm in the minority of people who feel that The Henry is a bit overrated. Don't get me wrong, it's fine. I've never had a terrible experience here... but I've also never had a mindblowing experience either, and have been here probably half a dozen times. I'm usually a huge fan of Fox Concepts, but this one just kind of underwhelms. Also, there's just something about the tagline \"The Greatest Neighborhood Restaurant\" that really grinds my gears, specifically if the neighborhood is hoity-toity Arcadia.   With comfy leather booths, mid-mod inspired chairs, and large wooden tables, The Henry pulls off a sophisticated look without being overly pretentious. The restaurant space is huge, stretching much farther back than you'd ever imagine looking from the outside. The most recent time I was here, we were celebrating a friend's birthday so our large party was placed in the test kitchen for a little more privacy. I didn't even know this room existed, but it was awesome being back there and getting to peruse some cookbooks and magazines while dining at the massive marble counter.   My service here has always been pretty standard, nothing to write home about. Everyone is always nice enough, but there are always little things with each server I've had--this ranges from being a little slow despite a not-too-busy restaurant, to some light confusion about fairly simple requests. Totally not a huge deal, just follows the \"middle of the road\" feelings I have about this restaurant.   I've mostly been here for brunch, and have tried a handful of the menu items including the Le Pig Sandwich, the California Scramble, and the Original Egg Sandwich. Pro-tip: ask for the Original Egg Sandwich on a croissant and with havarti instead of american. It's probably my favorite breakfast entree, which is telling, considering it is a pretty basic breakfast sandwich that you could get most places for half the price. It's always good, just maybe not $11 good. I feel the exact same way about the Truffle Parmesan Fries. $11 for french fries is actually absurd.  Generally, I'll just opt for a coffee and a pastry--the saving grace of The Henry. Their coffee bar, while a smidge pricey, is excellent and has wonderful pastries as well as great espresso drinks. The fella loves that they have gluten-free options for him, and says the bundt cake is one of the better gf desserts he's ever had. I love the Brown Butter Caramel Roll, though it does feel a little bit like you're just eating diabetes. But paired with black coffee (also superb here!), it's perfect. I'm also a sucker for chocolate and almond croissants, and both are great here.   I have no major issues with The Henry, I'll just never be the one to suggest coming here. It's pricey for the perfectly fine food that you're getting, so I guess you're largely paying for the environment. However, I am always a fan of a quick coffee and pastry stop.",

They may even get back on the menu!  Seems like they were a customer favorite. She will look into training, as that was my theme in both posts. She ended with a very courteous and generous offer to \"make it up to us\". Chelsea is the kind of GM who watches the store and cares about customer feedback. She was positive and made me feel like my feedback was important to her. We will go back and see how things shape up. Cannot loose if the carrot cake pancakes are on the menu.",

Then the bacon we ordered for breakfast was so dry & over done it was inedible - seemed like they made it in large batches and it just sat. We have been to The Henry several times before and loved our experience but this was a BIG misstep in our expectation of what we have come to love about The Henry!! So sad!",

It was chilly, but they have heat lamps so it was perfect.  We ordered the duck flatbread and short rib potstickers for appetizers. They both were amazing!  We also had the pumpkin porter(seasonal beer). For our entrees we both got the turkey french dip. It was better than I expected. I got the apple slaw (it was okay),my friend got the mac and cheese (fabulous). The dessert menu has 5 items and all 5 were tempting. We went with the croissant bread pudding and we were not disappointed. I would love to come back and try other items on the menu",

The food was excellent. Started off with the Brussel sprout Ceasar salad and the short rib potstickers. I would recommend both for starters - they even split our salad into 2 servings for us. I ordered the Korean skirt steak over veggie fried rice and tempura green beans. Server let us know ahead of ordering that it was spicy......it was the best. My husband had the black Thai cod - he liked it but he wished that he ordered my dinner.   Dessert was OMG delicious - chocolate peanut butter banana cake. I highly recommend this dessert.   Around $40/per person without alcohol. Their drink menu was diverse & creative.   LOVE LOVE LOVED this place.   Can't wait to go back!  Ask for Angela she is the best!!",

    "text": "First time visitor, had heard a lot of positive things.  First, the ambience is very hip; from the separate sitting areas (bar, coffee area, dining area, patio) that each have some different decor to the funky framed art on the wall, it feels current.  The menu is diverse but not overwhelming, and there are some creative dishes and drinks, including some fun mocktails for the lunch crowd.  I ordered the recommended chai lime ginger beer (4 stars) and it was good: slightly bitter and sweet and the chai flavored undercurrent was a nice mixture with the ginger.  Yum.  Next we ordered the \"popovers\" (3.5 stars)  I'm still not sure if that is a made-up dish or something that is real, but I've never seen a \"popover\" in my life before now.  It is basically a bread roll with the consistency of a souffle and is airy and mostly hollow on the inside, almost like a billowy pizza crust, with two really fancy butters: ham butter and chive butter.  It was all good; I surprised myself by preferring the chive to the ham butter.  I wish the popovers were a little more substantial on the inside; it was hard to spread butter within them because they were so hollow.  Entrees:  Fried Chicken Sandwich (3.5 stars): This was a good but not epic sandwich.  The chicken was moist, the toppings were fresh, but the sandwich didn't have enough sauce and flavor to blow me away.  If you like milder fare, this is probably a good choice.  Quinoa Tacos (3 stars): These were also good considering they were vegetarian, but will not rival a full-meat competitor: creatively served, tasty and light, but lacking the punch, smoke, and sizzle of a meaty alternative.  Cauliflower Polenta (4 stars): This is not the polenta I am used to, all rolled together in a big disc with sauce atop it, but is instead flavorful roasted cauliflower blended with polenta, almost like a couscous.  I loved it and are every bite.  Yum!  Bread Pudding (3.5 stars):  Moist, with caramel ice cream, and warm, this is a well prepared bread pudding.  It had a lot of raisins on it which had plumped up in the oven and in the moist trappings, but they were overwhelming to me.  Better if some banana caramel sauce were there instead of the raisins, then it could be a five star dish.",

We have been more times than we can count and the hot coffee's are always on the cold side. I would definitely recommend they up their temp settings on their coffee and espresso machines. I even asked for \"extra hot\" and it was like warm. Perhaps steaming the milk for lattes would help too. I would say the staff is friendly but not very efficient...young kids, super slow. Seems like someone always takes our coffees from the coffee bar and we have to have them re-made which includes more waiting time. The pastries are always beautiful and this is overall a good place to take company who is visiting. No pancakes available which is a bummer but we recommend the breakfast burrito. If you go, head here before the crowd so maybe before 9 am.",

Regardless, we were still going to tip 20% to our waitress even though she only checked on us once and our water glasses sat empty. We paid cash and when we got the change back, the waitress gave us our same 20$ bill back so that we didn't have change to tip the $17 20% tip. Ridiculous.

The Fig and Ginger mule is my favorite, specially when Tanner makes it, although Christina did a really good job also.  I cannot have enough of the Croissant Bread Pudding, it is a diet buster, but so worth it.

Aside from the fact that even if we made reservations, we still had to wait 15 min , then once we ordered our food that came after an hour and not even once were we updated on the status of our order. Also ,While we were ordering our entrees, our server recommended to one of my friends the skirt steak , because was cheaper ; that wouldn't have raised any eyebrows, but after we paid our bills we decided to take a group picture in front of the beautiful fireplace, 2 feet away from the table. While we were doing that, our server decided to drop by and check each individual receipt making sure apparently that we paid. He also lifted my mom's purse and for some really weird reason he took away her jacket. I approached him asking him if everything was ok, explaining him that we were only taking some pics and we'll be on our merry way soon...  Very disappointing! Again, loved the food, simply hated the service!",

Otherwise uninspired menu that is overall decent enough but not spectacular. Same goes for the ambiance and decor. It looks like they tried to do something interesting here, hired skilled designers and mostly pulled it off, but it still kind of falls flat. Very typical Fox concept.

The atmosphere is great though to sit and chat and have a cocktail, which we did. We had their \"figgy mule\" an it was delicious!  When we were seated the staff was courteous and we were greeted promptly by our server. He had a great personality and was super helpful with menu Recommendations. We started with the popovers with ham butter.  These were absolutely delicious. The only strange thing about this was when we got the bill. I'm assuming the order only comes with three popovers but we are a party if four so they charged extra for the single popover. Not a big deal but it would be nice if it was mentioned on the menu.  For out entrees I ordered the Gemmeli with Black Truffles and my husband ordered the Branzino. The Gemmeli was incredible!  The house made bacon delicious. My husbands Branzino though, not the greatest. Which was sad because it came highly recommended by the server an it was on the higher price point on the menu. The greens and mushrooms were phenomenal but I feel the fish wasn't cooked the way I'm used too. Most sea bass I've had melts in my mouth. This not so much.   We did end the night on a high note with the croissant bread pudding. Absolutely amazing!!  I would go back for the bread pudding and coffee alone.

    "text": "It's all about consistency.   In Scottsdale for a conference. Came here one night and had such a great experience that I booked a group reservation for a few days later. If only that same level of care had been present the second night.   My first visit: Crowded. Popular. Patrons were all having a good time. Nice large dining space. I was impressed with the unique selection of specialty cocktails. The service was good. The guy was timely and not imposing. Attentive. Helpful. The food was deliciously impressive. Which is why I booked a group reservation for a few nights later.   Second visit: We were all late getting there. The hostess was nice about it even though the hostess was consistently kinda crabby. Which reminds me... The hostess stand is a serious problem in this place!  The hostess stand faces the interior to the restaurant - not the door. When you walk in, it's hard to know where to go or with whom to speak about getting a table and the hostesses act like they're doing you a favor. But I digress...  So after we were seated and ordered our drinks, the server disappeared for about 30 minutes and never took our order. After we flagged down a different guy, our server returned finally with drinks. She took our order then and generally was just slow. After we all finished our entrees, once again our lovely server had disappeared. We might have ordered dessert had we not feared growing old and turning to dust before she decided to return. Our meals were good. Everyone was happy with that but the slow service wore us down. Basically, the server could have gotten us to order at least one more round of cocktails and a round of desserts had she been more on-the-ball. More food and drink & better service equals more business for The Henry and more tips for little Miss Amnesia. It's simple math.",

We split the Roasted Brussles Sprout Caesar salad and enjoyed every bite. The Korean Style Skirt Steak was amazing. I can't wait to have it again. The Roasted Chicken was juicy, and delicious along with the spectacular cauliflower Polenta. The only problem is deciding whether to try the brunch or come back for the Korean Style Skirt Steak.",

I loved the open kitchen and I loved that everything on their menu is made from scratch. Our server was awesome. Very friendly and helpful with the menu and she was attentive . We started off with some passion fruit & mango and mixed berry mimosas. I ordered the Chicken Bahn Mi and it was pretty delicious! Big chunks of chicken with all the toppings and I liked that the bread wasn't hard . Usually Bahn Mi sandwiches the bread is hard and it can cut the top of your mouth.  We also got some coffee and macarons. Good coffee and the macarons was one of the best I've tasted in a while.  I am only giving this place 4 stars because when we first arrived I went to go give my name so we can be seated. The hostess said it would be 20 mins and asked me for my name. So I thought she was going to come get us when a table was ready. As we were waiting we saw that other groups were getting seated before us and there were tables available. When we went to go see how much longer it would be, she said she could seat us now. If we didn't go up and ask about our table, we would have waited longer. The funny thing is , we were sitting near the front and in clear view of the hostess stand. She could have easily came over and got us but instead she just stood there.  Besides that, we enjoyed everything and I will definitely be coming back to try some more food from the menu",

First,  love the ambiance here, there are tables outside for 'in the country'  dining when it's triple digits out and if you'd rather go indoors, there's comfy wood environment inside, nicely cooled, warm woods everywhere.   The wait staff is focused.   The crowd:  the pretty people of Phoenix out for a meal.  You can tell the Henry makes money on drinks here, yet the bartender didn't have Aperol or cassis.  No biggie  I moved on to other drinks.   Dinner  Salmon Toast-- on a nicely chewy toast, arugula/cheese (not a fan of dairy with seafood), I should have asked beforehand but the dish was good.   Pork Chops, cauliflower mash, wine reduction.  I was craving a nice Pork Chop and this dish was superb,  coddled with a scrummy cauliflower mash and a wine reduction, I almost finished the entire thing, it was so good.  I expected a nicely made pork chop and I got it.   Bread pudding,  Salt Caramel Ice Cream-  Well made, the golden raisins made the difference and the croissant pudding was 2die4.  Needed it to be a lot warmer but still it was good.  Very nice dinner service, a smidge dressy for a very casual city.  Kitchen staff is very serious but I think it's because the resto is meant to be that, high service level to a dressed up crowd.  Twas a good experience, coming back.  Visits:  1  Tip:  Menu is straightforward.  Dishes tend to be larger.  If and your mate come, it's very doable to  order, eat half and swap plates:  then you get to try 2 dishes, or 4, or 6 depending on how many courses both of you partake.",

The place is huge, great decor, the patio is really beautiful. Great place for cute group pics! Fantastic service throughout the experience as well.   I had the spicy sausage scramble and it was delicious! Very cheesy and the chicken sausage was flavorful with just the right amount of spice. Served with breakfast potatoes, they were cooked perfectly.   My friend got the original egg sandwich and she loved the avocado/mayo combo. We also shared the Parmesan truffle fries which were more than enough to split and so so great! I'd totally come back just for these. They were served with a garlic aioli dipping sauce which made them that much better.   The pineapple grapefruit mimosa was super sweet and really good, it tasted a lot like OJ to me though. I liked the hibiscus mimosa much better, that one is a total gem!   All in all a beautiful place to have good quality food and enjoy a really cozy, comfortable, and sophisticated atmosphere.",

They were delicious with the Truffle aioli dipping sauce. My husband ordered the Henry house salad because the portion size is a little small here. It was tasty. Husband ordered seared ahi tuna and I had the braised short rib. They were both awesome!  A lot of flavor and super tasty. The rib was very lean, not a lot of fat. The ahi was cooked perfectly and the lemongrass broth was outstanding. We split a dessert, peanut butter molten cake. It was a little dry, but the banana gelato was very good. Our waitress was a little put out when we sat down but was in a better mood as we progressed. I guess she was anxious to leave. Would have given it five stars if her attitude had been better. All in all, it was a nice treat to start the new year.",

My order was supposed to come out with a side of potatoes but didn't so I didn't get them until he waiter came back and I was completely finished. I ended up eating them after everyone was finished and watching me eat. So there's that. Cool place though.",

The food, drinks, atmosphere AND service are all excellent and come together to make a truly fabulous experience. We live 2 minutes from The Henry and kept wanting to go and decided to drop in tonight for my boyfriends birthday... It is Saturday, it was 9:15 pm and we had about a 10 minute wait.  We started with cocktails- I got the Fig & Ginger Mule and he got the Old Fashioned. They were both wonderful... It was so nice to have a drink in a restaurant that was balanced and perfect. Finding well mixed cocktails is not that easy in this city... For dinner I had the Wild Mushroom Tortelli and he had the roasted turkey french dip. The Tortelli was fabulous- the sauce was flavorful and the textures in the dish were so balanced. The Turkey dip - OMG! Seriously, I don't know what they did to this turkey, but there was so much flavor packed into it it my tastebuds were dancing.  Then we moved onto desert (we rarely get dessert, but couldn't resist after the outstanding meal) The Warm Croissant Bread Pudding- let's just say, it was worth every calorie! Our server Matthew- it has been a long time since I have had really great service, it was so refreshing to be helped by someone who you can tell loves what he does. He was knowledgable, kind, helpful and just an all around great person. Thank you for this one Sam Fox! You hit the nail on the head...",

    "text": "After arriving late to Postinos for the Board and Bruschetta night, and facing a long wait, we decided to check The Henry out. It was pretty busy when we arrived, and told the wait was 30 min. After 40 min, hanging out in the nice coffee shop there, I went to the hostess to see about our table. They said it was ready, which I then wondered at what point they were going to tell us. After sitting, we asked for water. They brought lukewarm water with no ice in pint glasses. Ok, maybe the ice ran out, they're busy.  I was super hungry and decided to order the Diner Burger. However, when it arrived it didn't have grilled onions, as advertised. Just lettuce, tomatoes and a smattering of 1000 island dressing. Also, the patty was a well-done, 14\" hockey puck. The fries however, were great, but came with only a half mini-cup of ketchup. Maybe they ran out along with the ice.  So I got to experience, for the 1st time in my life, the experience of sending something back. I always thought they would spit in my food, like in the movie Casino, so I've never had the balls to try it. But hey, it probably would have been an improvement for the super dry, burnt burger. As a comparison, the Arizona Snowbowl cafeteria burger is better, but by a very slim margin. A manager came over and said they were trying to improve their menu. I opinioned that an In'n'Out burger was similar to theirs, but four times as good. After ordering instead the Gemelli and Black Truffle pasta, I was asked if I wanted any meat with it. Which probably was a warning sign since the dish included homemade bacon. When the dish arrived it was great, but only had 5 to 6 slivers of ham (and no bread!) Also, it was tiny. Plates of pasta are much bigger in Italy, and they aren't exactly supersizing everything. Also, most important I was promised BACON. I gave this place 2 stars, because the wait staff was excellent, and they tried their best to make excuses for the food.",

    "text": "Unfortunately this trip wasn't better than the last - if  possibly worse.  Boyfriend and friends hadn't been here yet and wanted to have a visit and a nice dinner. I was reluctant but I knew I needed to get back here for them to redeem themselves from my last visit.   I love their patio. It was great to have the opportunity to enjoy it on a nice night. Our server came over to us immediately and took our drink orders which was nice. One of our friends took a bit longer to decide what she wanted so you would think that he would grab the 3 other drinks and check back in a few....well 20 minutes later he came back and took her drink order and 10 minutes after that we all got our drinks - just the three of us...After we got our drinks, he tried to go do something else but we had to tell him that we wanted to order apps -I mean we had 30 minutes at this point to look over the menu. When our apps came out is when the last of us got our drinks. That was my first annoyance of the night. By the way, we didn't have silverware or napkins and had to ask someone else for them. When this random brought it over, he brought over 4 sets of silverware with one napkin....I had to get up and go get the napkins for the rest of the table.  We ordered the chicken and the egg app and our friends had the artichoke app. Normally, I don't like huge portions and actually love small plates but this appetizer was so small! There were two small bites of chicken, probably a quarter of a cup of stuffing and the egg. What makes me so mad is that I loved it! It tasted great but it drives me up a wall when you pay a decent amount for a small amount of food -and don't get me wrong, I am all about quality over quantity, but this was pushing it for me. Our friends enjoyed their dish but had the same complaint.  For my entree I had the Korean skirt steak with fried rice and green beans. Boyfriend had the pork chop, friend 1 had the peanut covered bass and friend 2 had one of the veggie dishes which I can't remember. The portions sizes on this were perfect and everyone enjoyed the food. It was really good. The fish tasted too fishy to me but friend 1 loved it so don't worry about that.  Since the portions were large, we had some leftovers and asked for them to be boxed up and in the meantime to receive the bill. Well we certainly received the bill but waited for a while for our leftovers.....that never came! They threw out our leftovers. I know shit happens but it was just icing on the cake for me. I asked to talk to a manager and he was very sweet and offered to cook us up more food, but at 8pm on a Sunday, you want to be able to fall into food coma, not wait longer. I appreciated him offering us more food but my intention wasn't to get anything for free, just to let him know the issues with the service and he took them kindly.   I think its really hard to go and spend $90 per couple (beer and wine included in that price) and have service like that. I know they are knew, I know there are kinks, but in my mind, a Fox Concepts restaurant that has a million places already going and successful should have service kinks like that worked out.   Since the entrees were good, boyfriend really wants to return. Again I am reluctant to go back for a while but we shall see. I really want to like this place - everywhere else in Arcadia is awesome.",

I came here with a friend on a busy Sunday and the place was definitely popping with patrons.  I definitely wanted to check out their Bloody Mary cart served up like Dim Sum, but alcohol was not on my mind that morning.  I just ordered their specialty coffee The Butcher since I needed to wake up and it did it's job!  I like my coffee black.  For my entree I shot for the Le Pig Sandwich; scrambled eggs, ham, havarti cheese, mayo, and served on a croissant with side of quartered potato hash.  Overall, I didn't really care for the sandwich since I found it pretty bland and had to add my least favorite condiment; ketchup.  I think if they used prosciutto and some pepper jack cheese it would have added some flavor and pop.   In the end, the atmosphere is worth the while and the coffee and bloody mary bar still is calling me. - Enjoy!",

We also order the house wine (and I'm not a huge wine person) but it was probably my second favorite glass of wine I've ever had in my life.   If you go we ordered the Buttered Crab appetizer, my husband got the short rib, and I got the Bolognese pasta and I would highly recommend all of those dishes.   We will be coming back many more times!!",

    "text": "Heard a lot about this place. For a while I have had friends talk about this place, how it's so nice, and food is amazing. I was recommended the Korean skirt steak. Today was my first time going. Upon arriving the parking lot seemed rather busy; complimentary valet for those who want to show off their cars I guess. Inside seemed rather busy as well. I dropped off my girlfriend at the front so she could get a table for us while it took me 45 seconds to find a parking spot (found one right away.) meeting up with my girlfriend to talk to the hostess to give her our number of contact to notify us when our table was ready (she told us 45 minutes) I thought to myself \"man this place must be the real deal then.\" We then got a coffee from the little shop inside and sat down. 45 minutes passed by, still no notification of any sort. So we waited a little bit longer. An extra 15-30 minutes passed by and still nothing! So, I took matters in my own hands; I walked up to the hostesses and asked regarding our table. Everyone seemed clueless in the idea I told them it was under my girlfriends name and whatnot. I told them how it had been a while since we waited and it was getting a little ridiculous. After the short fiasco, they seated us right way. Failing to tell us it was a special Easter menu, I was confused to wonder why the menu didn't have the steak I was told about. So, we asked the waitress. She then told us about the special holiday menu; but she claimed upon request, she will asked the manager. The \"manager\" comes by and claimed because of the special menu they will see if they even \"have the ingredients to make the steak.\"  In our minds (my girlfriend and I) wondered, \"Easter is one day. You're telling me something on the regular DAILY menu, you guys don't have the ingredients for.?\"  Anywho, they came back and told us they did have the ingredients and placed the orders. I ordered the French dip and she got the steak. Food honestly took 15 perhaps at max to come out and he quality was good but not great or amazing for the wait they made me endure. In reality of it all, wouldn't come back here as a daily thing maybe once in a blue moon.",

This was my first time dining here, but I've heard good things about their coffee shop portion also, so I'll make sure to check that out another time.  When I first walked in, I was honestly very confused where to go. There weren't clear signs on where to go, and there were 3 different entrance doors. I eventually found the 'front desk' area and got a table. The place is HUGE, with lots of seating indoors and outdoors. The decor is beautiful and definitely gives the place personality.  For brunch, I ordered the original egg sandwich ($11) that comes with potatoes. The sandwich was a decent serving size and I enjoyed it! I also had The Cleo (iced) for my morning coffee--the almond milk with hazelnut tasted so good, that I got a second glass of it!  Overall, this was a positive first impression. The menu items are a bit pricy, but I'd be open to trying this place again for the lunch or dinner menu.",

Very trendy Restoration Hardware atmosphere with multiple areas of dining, take out, casual high tops, bar area, outdoor patio dining and inside. Our server Iman introduced herself and was excellent.  Of course we ordered brunch cocktails: Grapefruit Mimosa and Bloody Marys. Entrees were: The California Bowl, (Eggs) Huevos Rancheros, Caramel Apple French Toast w/a side of Bacon and Bagel & Lox.  All the dishes were very good. The California Bowl a bit small for the price. Eggs Rancheros was excellent. French Toast was voted hands down the best dish ordered. The weakest was the Lox and Bagel, weak in presentation and when opened up only 2 tiny pieces of lox on each half not worth the price. We address this with Iman and it was quickly fixed (thank you Iman!)  All in all Atmosphere: Love, Service: excellent, Food: good though I would try other dishes before ordering the Lox & Bagel again... Go for the FRENCH TOAST!",

I was in the middle of an assignment when the wifi disconnected, I spoke with one of the managers who proceeded to tell me that there is no way around the wifi system.

After getting out of the parking lot, I hate to say it but I was a little confused. The front door doesn't look like their main entrance but it was. Double glass doors. Once inside, there's a coffee bar, tables, and a lounge area with chairs, couches, and tables but where's the hostess stand? Had to find it and it was to the far left. Looks like a normal table with a couple of computers on it. Very confusing at first. I'm just used to being greeted once I walk in the door. Oh well.   I guess I understand this after figuring out this place. It's what I call modern looking, trendy, and for us old people it's hip. Not a lot of old people and definitely not families with small kids. It's loud. It's the place to be seen.   We had to wait to be seated and they seat you at your reservation time. Felt a little blowoff at the time but we relaxed at their lounge area. Surprisingly, they remembered us and came to get us when our table was ready. Didn't need to carry around a buzzer or get paged. Very nice that they remembered.   We started out with the short rib potstickers. Very surprised. Really good. Short rib was very tender. Moist. Very tasty. It's soaked in soy sauce. Very very good.   After that, we had their kale & apple salad. We had them split the order. Even half was a pretty good size that you can split with someone. The kale was tender with slices of apple, cubes of cheddar, and some oranges. It was a very good salad. Really enjoyed this and would recommend.   I decided to have their Saturday night special. Honey-Tamarind glazed pork ribs. The ribs were fall off the bone and very good. They were a little fatty but pretty good. They give you six ribs with cabbage slaw and fried rice. Side don't make sense but it worked pretty good. The slaw was pretty good. Not bad but the thing that stood out to me was the fried rice. Had a nice kick to it. Spicy fried rice. A first but really good.   Seemed like my wife and everyone else got the braised short ribs. The dish seemed small but was very filling to everyone. The short ribs were very tender. Moist and tasty. Everyone enjoyed them.   To end our meal, I had the Cleo which was an expresso with almond milk & hazelnut. Little sweet but very good. Also, had the warm Croissant bread pudding which came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Really good and enjoyed this very much.   Service was pretty good. Our waiter greeted us right away and got us our drinks fairly quickly. Water cups were filled and our food was brought out quickly. I know the place was very busy so our server was business as usual. He did know the menu very well and did give us some really good recommendations.   So overall, really good meal. Good service and good food. Ambiance was very trendy, hip, and loud. Have to talk over all the other tables but I have to say it was a very relaxing meal. Very enjoyable. Enjoy and have fun. We did.",

As a new transplant from nyc, I was so glad to have found this place within the first month. The couch area has comfy seating scattered around the side of the restaurant, so you can pick wherever you want to sit. I picked an individual chair with a little coffee table which is perfect for a laptop and my coffee. There was another group of 3 sitting next to me at a larger table. The variety of seating arrangement in the coffee area adds a cool vibe to the modern industrial ambiance of the whole restaurant. No need to wait for the coffee seating unless you want to have brunch there. The specialty coffee I had was a bit too sweet. But the lovely design and ambiance of the place definitely wins me over! Will come back and hang m",

    "text": "This is by far my favorite Fox restaurant in terms of decor, menu and vibe. While it's certainly at a higher price point than some of the other concepts, most everything is executed well and seems *worth* the extra cost. Fabulous place to celebrate an occasion/holiday and feel like you're getting more of a casual splurge. The only criticism I'll agree with from the assessment of other reviewers is the incredibly slow service.   The interior is gorgeous, somehow making a nice open space feel cozy and chic at the same time. You have the option of camping out at the bar, relaxing on the adorable couches for more of a happy hour feel or sitting in the main dining area - all are full service. No matter where you sit though, I've found you'll be waiting a while. To be acknowledged, for your waters, your first drink order, any refills, etc. I don't know why such a great place with really nice staff has such. poor. timing. Our servers have always been friendly, knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the menu - it's not a personality issue. Are they just over capacity? Is there some kind of request-x-2-only refill policy on water? We've come here before and sat in the high-top area for 20 minutes before deciding to leave and dine elsewhere - which sucks because I know how great the food and cocktails are.  The food is ridiculously delicious. The warm kale dip is so garlicky good and don't miss out on the popovers. All of the seafood entrees are to die for (I'd choose this over Buck & Rider any day for the price) and that Croissant Bread Pudding is no joke. It's an absolute must regardless of how tight your pants feel after dinner. Wash it down with a cappuccino for a real indulgence. It's worth mentioning that the food itself is served up pretty quickly. I'd love to rate this as 5 stars, but slow service is just too consistent. And I LIKE long, drawn out meals where you're not pressured to leave. I LIKE servers who give you space without checking in every 5 minutes. But conscious, attentive yet considerate service is so different than elusive, hard-to-flag-down service. Sigh...I'll be back again and again, but not if those hunger pangs have already set in.",

The wait staff are helpful in finding the right cocktail for you. The burger is very tasty as well as the truffle fries and the apple kale slaw. The brussel sprout cesar salad was good but a little heavy on cheese and dressing and a little monotonous without the protein option. Great food overall, can tell they make their everything high quality and fresh. I might rate this place $$$ instead of $$ just FYI. A shared appetizer, two burgers (cheaper option) and shared dessert with drinks and coffee for 2 was about $100.",

I love the idea of The Henry - FOX corporate upstairs, beautiful upscale family/neighborhood diner feel with a busy bar and beautiful coffee/study area in the same place.  The design, decor, patio, service, and ambiance are all top notch.   You may already deduce that my low rating must reflect the food.  Correct, Watson.  Breakfast/brunch is great, but the lackluster dinner menu disappoints.  I've done it (dinner) 4 times just to be sure; but nothing is jaw-dropping or inspiring.  Plain fish in smallish portions, short ribs that are blah, other items that other places do better.  Furthermore, the menu has been the same since the beginning.  I will come back for breakfast/brunch, a drink, or coffee; but - especially for the price - never again dinner.  You will see in another related review that I prefer Chelsea's Kitchen, a cousin right up the road.",

The food is high quality, the service is good and we love sitting outside when we are here. We had to post a review because of their latest display of fantastic service. We ordered dinner the other night and my husband picked it up. We got home and realized they left out a main dish which meant someone wasn't getting their meal.  I called and spoke with the manager. Not only did he make us a new one, he offered to have another manager deliver it to our home since we live close by. They also included a dessert for \"our trouble.\" That is amazing service!

We were seated out on the patio after a 25 minute wait, only to find the patio practically empty- except for a huge photo shoot that was going on. This included a full crew, very bright lights, and loud conversation directing the shoot. It completely ruined the ambiance and was very distracting. The lights were so bright we had trouble keeping eye contact and spent most of the meal looking down at our plates. We asked to be reseated because of the bright lights, so they moved us a few tables over, which hardly made a difference. The picture shows the view of the shoot from our second table.

Upon checking our credit card statement, they charged our card 2 days before I was there with $500 amount! It seems The Henry is starting falling short on integrity and customer service.

Happy hour here is only for draft and well drinks, so we didn't benefit from it food-wise. We were greeted by a timid, shaky waiter on the patio and ordered the truffle fries (Applebee's-quality) short rib/s and pork chop. The short rib/s were quite small and lack-luster for the price (the similar dishes at North and Chelsea's just down the street could knock this tiny nightmare entree out). Pork chop was gigantic, but let's be honest- my mom makes better and it doesn't cost me $20+.   At the end of the meal, I felt horrible paying $92 for 3 \"happy hour\" priced drinks, a fry appetizer and 2 entrees. HUH?!",

    "text": "I'm a fan of the Fox Restaurant concepts & after visiting The Henry, I'll say I'm quite pleased with this restaurant! I came here for Sunday brunch with a group of people and we all had a great dining experience. A table was reserved for us so we were able to get seated upon arrival. Our drink orders were taken shortly after. We were waiting for a couple of people who were running late, but our waitress came by to make sure we had full cups of drinks, asked if we had questions, etc.  After a look over the menu, we all ordered a variety of different things, breakfast selections as well as lunch selections. I got the Wood Grilled Chicken sandwich with truffle fries. It was good; I wasn't super amazed with it, so I'm not sure I'll order it again, however I pretty much got exactly what I expected & what I was in the mood for. The only let down on the plate was the truffle fried which I upgraded to for an additional charge. They weren't crispy/crunchy, but more so soft/soggym however the truffle sauce that they came with was the saving grace.  Everyone else really enjoyed their meals. The cost was pretty high, especially for breakfast food, however I think it was worth the treat. I'd say The Henry is a great meeting place for a group. The decor inside is really pretty & the floor layout is very open so you're not sitting directly next to the table to your right or left. They also have a small coffee shop next to the restaurant, which I'd also be interested in trying out. I think we'll be back.",

Once seated, our server was straight onto taking orders. A quick ask of what was good gleaned some great results. The food was really good - I can't remember what we had from the menu as this review is some time after we dined there. Their white truffle parmesan fries were really good. The quality of their food was very fresh, and the service was great. Nice wine list also.",

I want to mention the service first.  In my opinion, the service can make or break your restaurant review.  The food can be incredible, but if the service is awful you probably will never return.  The service at The Henry was awesome.  We were greeted immediately by the hostess, and our waitress was as efficient as can be.  For beverages, if you like craft beer, I recommend the La Cumbre \"A Slice Of Heaven.\"  My wife had the Martin Ray Chardonnay.  We've been to the Martin Ray vineyard, and all their wine is excellent.  I ordered the Braised Short Rib, and my wife had the Roasted Turkey French Dip.  Both were great, but the Short Ribs stood out the most.  The texture of the Ribs and mashed potatoes was incredible.  I don't enjoy fungus (mushrooms), but my wife enjoyed them.  The icing on the cake was that bill was under $50.  To me, that is really good value for what we received.  Altogether I highly recommend The Henry.",

The waiter just loved talking to her and made the experience fun and friendly. My grandma tried the Roasted Turkey French Dip and she LOVED it!

For those of you devout bloody mary connoisseurs out there, The Henry provides a unique and impressive spin on the bloody mary bar. Unlike most bloody mary bars, theirs are prepared tableside. They allow you to select from their 4-5 different house infused vodkas, which include but are not limited to bacon, rosemary & garlic and chile verde. They mix the bloody mary for you, serve it in a generous sized tall glass, and garnish it with an assortment of veggies and a thick slice of Applewood smoked bacon. It was easily one of the best bloodies I've ever tried, if not the best. And all of this for only $10!  I will certainly be back!",

So me and yet another Sam Fox restaurant have to agree to disagree.   Professional?  Yes. Worth the tab?  0h hell no!",

    "text": "Since I've only been here once, I'm going to go with 4 stars. Hopefully I'll be back in Arizona soon so I can come back to The Henry and bump this review up to 5 stars!  The Henry is a beautiful restaurant that also has a cafe attached. It's definitely what one would call \"hipster\" but with such beautiful decor, how could one not be in love?  My friend and I came here on the weekend, so we had the pleasure of ordering off the brunch menu. We each had a cocktail - I ordered the Apricot Blossom Punch, which I wish I had in my hands right now... It was so delicious and the alcohol taste wasn't overpowering, but it definitely packed a punch (ha ha). My friend had the Cactus Flower Margarita, which was equally as delicious in both of our books!  We started with the Short Rib Potstickers. At first I was a little weary. But their potsticker rendition was absolutely delicious. I could've ordered another plate of it! The short rib was so warm and tender and easy to chew. It practically melted in your mouth. The yuzu ponzu was divine.  I had the Egg White Turkey Omelette - essentially a breakfast staple, so how could you really go wrong with it? The potatoes it came with were also delicious. My friend ordered the Flower Child Scramble which was also wonderful - eggs, brussels sprouts, winter squash (yum), roasted mushroom, kale, and some parmesan. Extremely healthy, extremely filling, extremely delicious.   Our waiter was extremely sweet and attentive. He was constantly checking on us without making us feel rushed or bothered. Overall, our time at The Henry was absolutely wonderful and we both can't wait to come back. Her before me, since she lives there. And I do not. So no Henry for me. :(",

The asparagus Caesar was wet and salty. The short rib was just okay. The seared tuna was actually pretty tasty, but the curry was extremely coconut forward and completely saturated the rice and overwhelmed the dish. The vegan strawberry shortcake is worth passing on. The best bite of the entire meal was the bread pudding. If I had to dine here again, I'd order only that. The place is upscale and the decor is inviting, but we went for the food, and it disappointed.",

The potstickers are extremely scrumptious and are my favorite item on the menu. I salivate over them at night sometimes. The price is perfect for the food. You get what you pay for, which is amazing food. If I had to go anywhere to eat, I would chose this establishment. My only word of advice is that the food is addictive and you may leave a few pounds heavier.",

    "text": "Congrats to FRC on creating yet another awesome dining option in my hood!  I love that The Henry... -is super close to my house -has a decent sized parking lot -has a fast casual option as well as a sit-down option -offers a diverse menu for any time of day including coffee and smoothies, breakfast sandwiches, lunch salads, sandwiches, and entrees -has some fabulous cocktails -has a solid free wifi connection -and a kids' menu too!  I've been in during the day a few times and once for a date night.  To date, I've tried the following menu items: -americano (I know - boring... but I do plan on trying some of their specialty coffee drinks in the future!) -protein smoothie -chef chopped salad -warm kale & roasted garlic dip -wood grilled artichoke hearts -Thai peanut black cod -vodka & pulp cocktail  Everything I've had to date, I've been pleased with... and it's worth noting that even if you order from the coffee bar, they are accommodating and will customize a menu item for you.  For example, when I ordered my chopped salad, I requested no ham and added avocado... and it was no problem!  FRC did a great job with the ambiance and modern decor too... the place has great energy to it!  I haven't taken advantage of the outdoor seating just yet, but they also have a pretty spacious outdoor patio.    Last thing to note: MAKE A RESERVATION!  I attempted to head in for lunch one week day with a party of 2 (without a reservation) and it would have been over an hour wait.  And on the Saturday night date night, we never would have gotten seated if it weren't for our reservation.  This place gets packed... and for good reason!",

I have to say that dinner did not disappoint!  We started with wine and drinks.  I got an apricot blossom punch that was delicious...enough to have two.  The others in the party stuck with traditional drinks and wine (good varieties there).  We also started the meal with garlic fries an popover rolls, both of which were nice starters.  Our entrees were also delicious, from the braised short rib (mine!), to the  korean style steak, to the chicken, and the fish.  All our meats were prepared very well - great flavor, tender, cooked just right - and the sides were equally delicious and well paired with the entrees.  We didn't save room for dessert, but thoroughly enjoyed all that we tried.  Service was good, friendly and appropriately attentive given how busy they were.  We sat outside on the patio...also very pleasant.  Nice spot, good menu, all around excellent.",

    "text": "Henry must be a popular guy! This newest addition to the FRC collection was an excellent setting for my mom's birthday. Since we are frequenters of the others, this restaurant had to live up to not only those standards, but also the hype apparent by the necessary reservations and vibrant din on a Thursday evening.  To start, we ordered the smoked Norwegian salmon and artichoke hearts. I really liked both, though the salmon was my favorite - the potato cake consistency was like a mini crab cake. My mom wasn't too keen on her Brussels sprout salad which they took off our bill without skipping a beat.   Dinner was a tough, down to the second type decision. Everything on the menu looked so good. I opted for the skirt steak with fried rice. The meat was recommended medium and somewhat chewy but the flavors altogether were outstanding. My fiancee ordered the half chicken, so if you've been to one of these restaurants before, you know how good that was. And, it comes with two sides. My mom ordered the Branzino, a highly tender and delicious fish option that I suggest you try. Normally a finicky eater, she ate every bit!  Birthday dessert was their peanut butter bar served with ice cream. Cue the spoon fighting! It didn't take long for us to wipe the plate clean. They really did a wonderful job at charming, feeding and celebrating with us on our special occasion.",

    "text": "My sister and I came here for late lunch Thursday. The menu was very limited and the only item we could get since we are cutting carbs was a salad. I love a good Cobb, and we each ordered one. At $15, they don't even use real roast turkey, it is the pressed \"loaf\" cut into tiny cubes (nasty). The cheese was not Blue (which is standard) and tasteless, and the salad was much smaller than the \"authentic\" Cobbs at 5 & Diner, or even Denny's [both less expensive]. There was literally not enough lettuce (cheap item) to accompany the other ingredients. We both had a good 1/2 cup of \"stuff\" left in the bottom of the bowl which needed the crunch of the romaine to finish. The \"Ranch\" dressing had extra herbs/spices making a really strong flavor that I didn't like, and they don't have \"regular Ranch.\" I asked for Blue Cheese dressing to make up for the lack of it in the salad, and they don't serve that either. The waitress offered Thousand Island (rarely my choice), but it had been doctored up so it didn't taste like the good old-fashioned stuff that's been around for 60 years (didn't even see minced pickles in it, a standard ingredient). Even the cheese dip Patty ordered, with celery for dipping, before I arrived was too strong and tasted off-putting.  I am a Foodie and typically don't mind a modern spin on a Classic dish or additions IF it tastes better, but I left a little hungry and very disappointed in my lunch, so not sure if I'd return to try another entree.   On a positive note, the vibe and atmosphere were good, with great patio seating, etc. It is a busy, bright, cheery and upbeat place. We also had excellent service from our waitress, Adrianna, where we ate at the bar. So yes, I would go back for drinks at the bar . . .",

Although I have had tastier Bloody Mary's (this one was a little more on the thin side than I prefer), you get to choose from 4 vodkas: onion and celery, bacon, and two chile flavored ones (I forget which). My only qualm with this process is that they have someone personally come to your table to make them and there's an unspoken expectation to tip (there is a tip jar with money). I completely understand why one should tip (and we did) but it feels tacky and frankly unnecessary--I'd rather just have mine brought to me like other restaurants. My own cheapness aside :), it was undeniably yummy.  I split the Prairie Breeze Cheddar Popovers and the grilled asparagus and poached egg with one of my friends and it was the perfect meal for the two of us because we were not overly hungry.  The grilled asparagus and egg dish was delicious---the egg was done perfectly and the asparagus were really flavorful.  My friends liked the Cheddar Popovers a lot but I think I had too high of expectations because they really just tasted like 'normal' croissants. Overall, I liked the experience and I'd go again but would try something else.",

On a whim, I took my Valentine there yesterday (Valentine's Day), no reservation, 6pm. We were immediately able to be seated on the front patio, which is first come first serve. The inner and outer decor were equally impressive; personally this is my favorite design theme out of any Sam Fox concept. Our waitress was nice and all the service was excellent. But unfortunately, the food was sub-par.   Beginning with the kale and garlic dip, this was definitely the best dish we had. Above average. Next the artichoke hearts were a very small portion and decent. The Brussel Sprout Caesar was disappointing and I couldn't even eat my overly-saucy, overly salty mushroom tortellini. To their credit, the waitress noticed I hadn't touched the entree and immediately removed it from the bill. While this was an appreciatively kind gesture, it still didn't make up for how both my honey and I wound up with stomach aches and had to go to bed. Not a romantic end to our Valentine's at The Henry..",

Once seated it took awhile to get water or start our orders.  The food here was tasty! I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich, which came with fries, and upgraded to truffle fries. The fries were delicious! Note that although on the menu it states that the sandwich comes with havarti it ALSO comes with american cheese. I returned my sandwich upon arrival because I don't really care for american cheese ( the manager had told me after my switch that the menu does NOT list all the items that may be included on the entree....too bad) This wasn't a major event, however because I needed a new entree, most of the rest of the table was completely finished with their meals and waiting to order dessert. When the new sandwich came out, they included the kale apple salad and that was very light and refreshing.  To drink I had the chai lime ginger beer and that was amazing! It tasted like Christmas in a cup-- you must try it! For dessert I had a few bites of the croissant bread pudding. It had rum (or whiskey?) soaked raisins and caramel ice cream--very very delicious and decadent.  Our server was very pleasant and friendly. The manager was nice, but I wasn't too thrilled that when I had pointed out that the menu just lists havarti and not american cheese, she checked to menu to see if I was right. It's VERY loud here, I had read that in other reviews, but they aren't kidding! Be sure you don't really want to \"catch up\" with someone if meeting them here!",

    "text": "Fox does it again....  You might like this place. I thought it was really good. The atmosphere was different and what I would call comfortable elegance. I felt as if I was nestled in a nice library in someone's home. Love the high ceiling. Kind of an odd location but once you're inside you forget where you are.  I had a chai lemonade ginger soda. Be sure to stir it up before you drink. Food was also good. The owners go out and pick their own tomatoes for the salad I had! I also shared the turkey French dip and it was fresh and fabulous.  I liked it because there is a full beautiful bar dining and sitting area on one side and then on the other side it is  more of a coffee soda bakery kind of environment.  HH everyday 4-6.  Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. Also a coffee bar and pastries open regular business hours.   What I found to be a little wonky was the open space on the very far west side of the establishment. Very different atmosphere. There is a television where you can watch sports. There's lots if empty tables scattered awkwardly and brighter lights.  Food for though Fox... You might consider having live music in that area...... Perhaps a coffee house featuring smooth jazz or acoustic, Spanish guitar...Plenty of good musicians looking to play for their supper, perform and be heard by patrons out for an evening of relaxation.  Or maybe you're transforming that area into a pizza parlor .....keep on truckin'....;-)  Overall with the exception of the far west side of the establishment The Henry is definitely worth a look. Parking can be a little precarious but can be found. I can say with confidence you'll find a space to settle in at The Henry.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxrc.com%2Frestaurants%2Fthe-henry%2F&s=459ec8a2a30bc257cd50086f6b39a792e5c96b72e7a85b89769df13b24e06ab6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">foxrc.com/restaurants/th...</a>",

I tried the chef's breakfast special just because it sounded so unusual and Seth recommended it, so I trusted and wasn't disappointed. Very good.  The Kale and apple slaw surprised me and is my favorite item right now. And the white truffle and parmesan fries.. well just order and thank me later.  I always ask to be seated in Seth's section! He's the school teacher by day/server on nights/weekends! His great people skills allows him to give amazing attention without hovering, good suggestions, fun personality. He definitely completes the dining experience ! He's the best!  This will become a regular spot for me.",

The place is so uniquely design with a very nice blue tone throughout the facility adding the aesthetic to the vibe. This place is packed during brunch time but they have small tables by the couches, bar seating, and coffee bar for people to enjoy while waiting to be seated. Every server and hostess are super friendly. I ordered the flower child scramble with cauliflower, brussel sprouts, kale, mushroom, and parmesan. It was amazing and it came with potatoes that are done perfectly. I didn't have to with long for my food at all. The coffee was amazing too, without tasting burnt.

Go to the coffee station area and order a fun coffee drink to pass the time before your reservation comes available. 3. Be adamant that you don't want to dine outside off the parking lot (no go).

Everyone really enjoyed their food, but the star seemed to be the sides of Mac and cheese.  My favorite part of the meal was dessert. The peanut butter molten chocolate cake was great and the bread pudding was good as well.  I can't say enough about how attentive and sweet our waitress was.

    "text": "NomNomz: 3/5 Libations: 4/5 Service: 3/5 Ambiance: Semi-fancy, Art Deco vibe   Awesome piece of property and set-up, great hot spot in Arcadia to grab breakfast or lunch over the weekend. Totally dig the decorations and Art Deco vibe, right up my alley. Those classic turquoise parlor seats up at the bar, hells YASS! A bit too much of a scene though, so if you're looking for a laid back quiet place, I'd look elsewhere. A bit stuffy in there to be perfectly honest. I'd rather spend my money and time at a place that has a more welcoming vibe. The Henry? Not so much, unfortunately but still a cool spot to check out at least once.   Nomz: The food is just OK in my book. There isn't really anything that's special on the menu and all the dishes I've tried lack flavor. Each time I've gone my order has had a missing element that the chef forgot wahhhhh. Ahem, like Oaxaca cheese, a key part of any breakfast dish. This place has great potential though. I hope they switch the menu up and offer more salivation-worthy options. They've got he standard brunch options that range $8-$12, scrambles, burrito, avocado toast etc. I wish I had a sweet tooth, because the Caramel Apple French Toast sounds baaamb! ($12). The menu is short and sweet and easy to choose from.  Libations: Their cocktails are the best thing they offer in my opinion, with some fun names too. The Drunken Panda is next on my list if I go back (cucumber saki, dragon fruit tea -$12). I always order the Strawberry Sidecar ($11), with Brandy, Cointreau and smashed berries YUM. Their cocktails range from $11-$13, with a pretty wide variety to select from, so order the one that calls to you.   Service: In my experience, half the staff is SUPER friendly and just overall delightful and chatty, and the other half has major attitude and definitely isn't on the pleasant side. It always makes such a difference when staff is so welcome and makes you feel at home. Better quality service would keep me coming back for sure.   Overall experience: Pretty good menu selection, but both times I've gone the service has been so-so, and the workers give off a vibe that they don't want to be there. A bit of a pretentious scene, not the best vibes, but still a good place to catch up with friends and share a meal.",

    "text": "Finished an acupuncture appointment in the neighborhood and decided to scoop up dinner on my way home. My fiance loves the turkey french dip here so I decided on this place. We've only come for breakfast and lunch so dinner was new to me here.   Thankfully, his turkey french dip was on the dinner menu. I ordered the bolognese because I saw something on another Yelper's review about the truffle oil and I love truffle anything! Is pasta a good idea when I'm trying to lose weight? Probably not but it was definitely a good idea. Definitely a dish I would order again.  Anyway, my fiance was disappointed. I got all the way home after a 20 minute drive to realize that there was no au jus for his french dip. That is one of the reasons why I deducted a star. The other reason: I called and was put on hold for 5+ minutes and someone picked up to tell me that they will put me on hold again for takeout at the coffee portion of their store - Before they put me on hold again, I told that person I was on hold already.   Yeah, 5 minutes isn't that long but I was already on my way there and didn't want to be put on a holding loop.",

We sat in a booth and the interior of the restaurant is warm and inviting and very relaxing. Service is excellent. I just had 2 eggs fried medium and they were cooked perfectly, great crispy bacon and very good whole wheat toast that comes with a side of soft whipped butter and jelly. My husband had the California scramble and it looked delicious and he loved it. We both ordered cappuccino's. I was fine with it but my husband is very fussy about his coffee and it wasn't to his liking but if you read my review of the Henry he didn't like their coffee then either.  We will definitely return especially to try it for dinner.",

It is a quaint little spot that is attached to a coffee house. It has comfortable outdoor seating. The interior has an eclectic,  contemporary vibe. There is a full bar. The booth seating is wide and really good for groups and there are cute little love seats for casual dining.   The food is yum, yum, yum...  The parker house rolls are either food from the gods or the devil (depending on how you look at carbs). The Turkey French Dip is amazing.  I usually eat one there and take on to go. The boneless short rib entree is fork tender, no knives needed. Speaking of short ribs, the short rib potstickers are AMAZING . They also do table side guac.. it has the interesting addition of pistachios which gives the guac a nice salty crunch. For brunch they also have a bomb bloody Mary bar..  just go. That's all",

Coffee - THE BEST Atmosphere - THE BEST Mules - THE BEST Apps - only had a few - but very good  What upsets me is the $18 chicken Brussel sprout salad. Now you're probably saying to yourself \"18 for a SALAD\" and you would be right! But based on my love for their avocado toast I was ok with paying a little extra if the food was good.  What a disappointment!  It was the size of a side salad and contained 1 Brussel sprout. 1. Cut in half. 1. In a brussel spout salad... hmmm As you can see by the size of my book - it is a side salad - NOT an 18 dollar m  As you can see by the photo it is disappointing. I've written to the company but alas - crickets.  I will continue to go there for the coffee - but they can keep their overpriced salads aka - snacks!  Update: Thank you Larry for your response. I agree that the Cesar was 12 and protein 6, but as you said - it should have been more in the salad. I am not sure how to get a hold of you but appreciate your taking the time to write and offering to have me try another salad. Please let me know how I can meet up with you so I can do so.",

There's also an area where you can chill or bring your laptop and work while sipping a delicious cup of coffee.  I went for brunch, my favorite thing to do now on Sundays lol. Anyway....!!! The atmosphere was great, busy and loud but overall what do you expect on a Sunday brunch hour. The service was excellent and the server at my table gave great recommendations. Okay so what got me interested in the first place was also the Bloody Mary cart that goes around the room. I had to order one and it was Ahhh-mazing! It was perfect from the tomato juice to the add ons and the level of spicy I can request. I think I got mine with Jalapeno vodka. It was risky but glad I took the chance.  For my entree I ordered the egg white turkey omelette. It was yummy with avocado on top and potatoes on the side.   Overall, I would highly recommend this place not just for brunch. Everything on the menu sounded so good hahah... I'll definitely come back !",

Giving it a 4 star rating because there isn't anything I can complain about personally, but my sisters chicken was pretty dry, so she barely touched her food. Overall, the service was great as was the food and drinks (except the chicken). Our table ordered 1 appetizer (the bread), 4 different entrees (fish, chicken, burger, and skirt steak), and 2 different drinks (mule and mezcal). We also had a 19 month with us and she had fruit, tomato slices, and French fries.   Food came out quickly, was hot, and prepared as ordered. Our server was attentive and came by multiple times tonchecknon us. Our drinks were never empty.   I would return. I ordered the burger and will share pictures. It is a solid selection and I chose the kale ams apple slaw for my side which had a great, slightly sweet flavor from the apples.   I didn't feel like going back to the menu to add descriptors or find the actual names of dishes and drinks...  sorry.",

This time I met a couple of friend's here for a weekly dinner get together since they have not been here before.  I was very disappointed in the food first and foremost.  The waitress was very nice and on top of it.  On the other hand the kitchen was struggling to put out food in a timely matter when the restaurant was only at half capacity.  We waited over 45 minutes for our appetizer's and over an hour for our main entrees.  When my entree came out after all that time it was cold not even lukewarm.  My other two friends meals were to their liking though.  The waiter was sympathetic and realized the situation and she took off one dessert from our bill for the long wait which was very thoughtful and professional of her.  The manager came around and asked us if everything was good and it was as if she was clueless as to what was going on in the restaurant about the long wait times.  The food is not reasonably priced by any means, but when it doesn't come out right to begin with it is unacceptable especially from a Fox Concepts Restaurant.  Overall the wait staff was excellent, but the management and kitchen staff was very disappointing.  I can't say that I would be back to this restaurant after this dining experience.",

    "text": "Reason for visit: rough day at the office   Service: friendly, helpful and will help you when ordering which I appreciate  Cool points: the patio is awesome for outside dining and if the table next to the fireplace is open - jump on that  Food: I am limiting my score to only 4 stars because this was my second visit - but each time, I've only ordered cocktails, appetizers and salads. That being said - the cocktails are the best I've had in the Arcadia area and the appetizers have always been tasty....I recommend the brussel sprout caesar salad, the short ribs potstickers and for dessert - chocolate molten lava cake. I ordered the Fig and Ginger mule which was the perfect start and finished with the Fox on the Run which is light, delicious and refreshing. The bf ordered the Boulevardier (sp) and the mischief - he loved trying this new place out. I'm positive we'll return again.",

I generally meet friends to study and this was always one of our favorite places to go because we could have coffee/study but also were able to enjoy lunch. It seems like they have since implemented a 2 hour limit to the WiFi..  Seems like another reviewer noted that the management had mentioned that this was due to 2 hours being \"complementary\" now..seems like an attempt to not have people spending the day doing their work/school there. I have actually never been to another establishment of the same caliber where I have been told I have a 2 hour limit with the WiFi...especially when I spend more then I probably should during my time spent within the establishment.    I guess I will take my business/friends elsewhere, there are plenty of places where I am able to get a decent $6-8 coffee and $12-$17 sandwich while using the \"complementary\" WiFi as I wish.",

    "text": "Super super cool place, very hipster, good for a lot of different occasions.     They have a cute little coffee bar with high top seating with outlets for studying, they have actual comfy furniture that would be great for a little meeting with some friends for coffee. They also have a bar and a formal dining area and really nice patio.   I've come here twice once during the day and once at night. It was much more popular and in my opinion a had a better vibe in the day than at night. It seemed like in the day it was a hip laid back industrial coffee joint  and when it comes more dinner time they try to make it into a more formal dinner place.    it can be a little confusing when u first walk in If you have never been there before because when u walk in either door there's no hostess at the door, the hostess stand is in an odd place not near the door facing the opposite direction. I wandered around for quite some time before figuring out where the hostess stand was. If u don't know what you're doing it can be kind of weird and awkward.  As for the food, we had some drinks and some appetizers. We got the guacamole which was yummy and came with homemade chips and the Parmesan fries which we really loved. Both were pretty good but pretty pricey for the portions. But I suppose it was quality over quantity. Just be prepared to spend a pretty penny especially if you come with a group. the bartender was really sweet and knowledgeable and she helped us pick some tasty options. My date and I couldn't quite put our finger on it but their menu was lacking something as was the night time environment.   All in all super cool place with a great atmosphere. Perfect for small gatherings of friends or a nice coffee date. would definitely recommend trying it out but would for sure prefer their brunch/lunch time ambiance than their dinner time vibes.",

We found out when we got there that it was restaurant week and there were some good deals to choose from on the restaurant week menu. Our waitress kept our glasses full and did a great job handling our excessive questions about the menu and drinks.   The drinks that came from I'm the bar were fantastic, a majority of the food was delicious, service was great. I would recommend the Henry to friends.  What I would suggest trying:   Cocktails- From the menu, Ole Kentucky and Texas Paloma were solid. Also had a mojito and it was just good.  Appetizers- Made to Order Guacamole and Smoked Norwegian Salmon  Entrees- Skuna Bay Salmon and Braised Short Rib (The Roasted Chicken wouldn't be a first choice)  Desserts: I tried the Lemon Meringue Tart and Warm Croissant Bread Pudding and didn't care for either of them.",

I thought I was a little underdress at first but by the time I left, I didn't feel as self conscious so I suppose it depends on how early you get there.  The Norwegian smoked salmon is to die for! I wish I had ordered two. The smoked salmon was fresh and delicious on top of the fried potato (I think they said it was hash but everyone seems to have a different view on what hash browns/potatoes are). It was superb.  My father ordered the black cod and the kale & apple salad. The salad was amazing. I was afraid there would be too much dressing but there was just enough. The apple was a little tart but it prevented the salad from being sweet, which I liked.   Only my father ate the cod. He said that the texture of the cod was on the soft side and he prefers his fish more firm. Other than that, the flavor was acceptable to him, I guess.   If I am ever in the area again, I'm coming back for the smoked salmon and the service! The waitresses and hostess, down to the man who refilled my water, were super nice!",

I called the restaurant with a peculiar request: I wanted to purchase a bottle of champagne for the table as a surprise. The Henry could have not made the process any easier. The manager with whom I spoke was courteous and clear, sending me all the proper documentation via email within ten minutes of our conversation; sending me an unnecessary but appreciated note thanking me for my business and confirming that everything went off without a hitch; and prior to my purchase, letting me know of all the options with my previously stated price range.   And my understanding is that my friend and her group of diners all had a great meal and a great time, as well.",

As a follow up to the really dishonest and disrespectful treatment we experienced from the hostess and \"manager\" as detailed in my previous review, I was contacted by a manager named Kolin, who told me to contact another manager named Nate, who told me that they had \"fully refunded\" my credit card.   I didn't ask for a refund, I didn't expect a refund (and the truth is I didn't believe it when I was told as Nate didn't mention it until the middle of the conversation as though he was making it up at that moment) but he said they had already refunded my card so I said I appreciated it. And guess what?   NO REFUND AT ALL.   NOTHING.   JUST MORE LIES.   At least they're consistent.   Lied to by the hostess, lied to by the night manager and lied to by the day manager...that's the trifecta of bullshit!

Think it is for the smartphone crowd that doesn't actually speak to each other. There is zero noise reduction materials in the place. Wide open to kitchen and bar is in restaurant area. So it is very very noisy.   The food was good as was the service. Got drink orders right away and the drinks are all custom cocktails that most of probably have no clue what they actually out in them, even after you read it. Those smarter than you cocktails. Which usually turn out to be good.   The caramelized scallops were really good but have had better (like Vogue Bistro). Popovers are excellent and the herb butter had an almost Tzatziki sauce flavor. Which I thought was very good. Ham butter was just alright.   The lobster salad was ok but, to me, very overpriced and had some tough to chew greens. My wife couldn't even chew some of it. For me, too much of a mix of greens. Pick something. Little amount of lobster for the price.   Thought the desert (peanut butter banana cake) was just alright. Not super impressed. More surprised they didn't buy it for us for anniversary.   They really didn't make a big deal about anniversary which I found very odd. Why ask if we are celebrating something if you have zero intention of doing anything about it? Don't understand that.   Personally I doubt I will be back as nothing was crave worthy or must have.",

    "text": "We've been on a bit of a Fox binge lately, and I think I can sum up our feelings on The Henry in one word: Yup.  That's really all you need to know. It is outstanding.  First, the decor and ambiance is so glorious. You're sitting in someone's fancy mansion living room, except there's a gigantic kitchen in there so you can watch the action. It's such a unique environment, one that I haven't experienced in any other restaurant, and I LOVED IT.   I started with a delicious glass of Sangiovese blend, while boyfriend ordered a pinapple passion fruit from their homemade soda list. (LOVE this trend.) It was tart and refreshing!  We started with the kale and roasted garlic dip, because obviously this is what one does when they see such a thing of beauty on the menu. I'll now dream of that cheesy, bubbly dip and how to replicate it at home, but I'll know it's a lost cause and have to head back there to order it again and again. (Kale means it's low-cal.)  I decided to keep with the gluttonous theme for the night and go with the black truffle lasagna. Two more words: COME ON. Your own (deceptively) tiny skillet comes out of the oven in a glory of pasta, cheese, mushrooms and brussels. Those shaved brussels really made it. I had to pump myself up to finish the entire thing (because I am fat), but it was worth it. So, so worth it.  Boyfriend had been waffling between the roasted chicken and burger. Our server quickly assured him the burger was amazing, and he kept it classic with a side of fries. He said it was easily one of the best burgers of his life. (Remember that fat thing I said up there? I used some of his fries to finish off the lasagna sauce left in my plate. Told you.)  The Henry really did live up to the hype for us. The only downside was that I don't get to live next door. Many return visits await!",

The inside takes on a fresh twist to an old world charm study in someone's million dollar mansion. Upholstered chairs and love seats, modern ceiling to floor curtains, open concept and beautiful slabs of dark wood tables. The Henry has everything--dining, drinks, coffee, and baked goods.  I recommend the kale/garlic dip, tomato toast, quinoa tacos, bolognese pasta and of course, BREAD PUDDING! Fantastic service and amazing food, this place a favorite of mine in Phoenix!",

From the decor to the menu I think everything is spot on.  Service has always been friendly and consistent, while also helpful.  A+ for this Fox Restaurant!  It's been awhile since we had dinner here, but I can remember everyone in our large party was satisfied with their meal.  We were celebrating a birthday and the restaurant helped make that special.  This place is quite \"open\" so it was kind of loud, but really the atmosphere makes up for that.  For brunch, I had the egg sandwich, which was delicious... just like the one I like and Olive and Ivy.  The Hubs had the chicken fried biscuit thing and man oh man was that good.  Loved that it was heavy, but light... you don't feel like a fatty after eating it, which is nice.  We also shared a caramel bun and each had the fresh squeezed lemonade.  Both were so good... I could eat/drink both every day of the week.  For sure, hit up the Henry.  You won't be disappointed, but get a reservation... this place seems to be always busy!  Oh and the coffee place that is attached looks awesome, gotta try that!",

We arrived at 7:30 or so and it was busy, but not packed.  We got 3 seats at the bar and were served promptly.  After we ordered our drinks we had a chance to take in the decor which was hipster friendly.  It's a southern themed homey place that resembles a plantation house from the outside.  The people when we arrived were in their 20's, early 30's but as the night went on the crowd thinned out and the crowd became older.  The service was great, but I was a little disappointed that they ran out of their ginger glazed black cod entree.  They must have had a real run on it as it was only 7:45 when they ran out.  Instead, I had the roasted chicken, which was moist and delicious.  The mac and cheese was a little disappointing, but the smashed garlic potato was a hit.  The texture was perfect, slightly cream, and it was  delicious.  The place cleared out about 10 pm, but it was a school night.  I'd definitely recommend The Henry as a good place for happy hour or dinner.    Summary: Available food is great, service is great, a good location for happy hour and early dinner.",

The only meal that was below average was the chicken fried chicken. It came a fair amount after the rest of the dishes. Not sure why the delay.  The server brought out toast and a side of bacon for him \"while he waits\". The dish consisted of 1 biscuit and 2 very small pieces of the chicken and eggs.

I recommend planning a reservation with the concept of experiencing The Henry moreso than consuming food -- it's memorable from start to finish and each of its menu items comes equipped with talking points making it a great daytime date spot. I recommend giving the coffee varieties a try -- consider the wildflower or the dropout (both can come iced as well!) if you're interested in trying more artisanal caffeine cocktails. While it is typical diner food, it doesn't ever feel like a typical diner.",

The Henry is spacious and its classy interior is eclectic without being whimsical.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and didn't hesitate to recommend only the most expensive items on the menu. So I wouldn't recommend just saying yes to whatever they recommend to drink or you might end up with a $200 bottle of sparkling rose.   Everything we tried on the limited New Year's Menu was fantastic.  The Cheese popover with the ham butter was unique. I would highly recommend the short rib. It's a True short rib in a delicious bourbon sauce that you can cut with your fork. Try the cauliflower polenta too. It was bright and buttery.   This place is going to be a mainstay of the area and perhaps the most successful of the Fox concepts in the city.",

It looks like a library meets a hotel lobby. It definitely could be a wonderful place to work from home or for a business meeting.   As for the food, I tried the egg sandwich and the salted carmel sticky bun. OMG the salted carmel sticky bun was out of this world and it was especially nice because it wasn't too heavy like a normal cinnamon bun. It was thinner and lighter. The egg sandwich was solid and enjoyable.  The only downside (which wasn't big) is that the coffee is just so-so and they only have one option to choose from, but that could change since they are new.  Overall a great experience and I will definitely be returning!",

We came here with a party of seven and were immediately turned away saying they, \"Couldn't seat that amount of people.\" However I noticed other reviews indicating parties greater than ten.   After this I decided to give them another chance. We stopped by for a dinner and was informed that it would be a 45 minute wait. After an hour and twenty minutes our table was, \"Finally\" ready. After taking our seats the we eventually received a glass of water after 10 minutes. We ordered the Korean style skirt steak which came out Luke warm. The rice was slathered with chili sauce. It tasted like a poor mans bimbimbap. We also ordered the seafood Henry salad which can only be described as a side salad. It barely covered 1/3 of the plate and had no flavor.  If you're that curious to try this restaurant: 1. Make a reservation. 2. Don't show up hungry 3. Expect a long wait 4. Enjoy the ambience because that is the only worth here  I've lost hours of my life at this restaurant and it was one of my worst experiences I've ever had.",

    "text": "The Henry One of my favorite dining buddies and I went for the last night of restaurant week - neither of us had been to the Henry before - and the menu looked fantastic. We have made a habit of dining together at least once each restaurant week - and find a place heavy on veggies or water protein (she doesn't eat anything that walks or flies), so we can share all courses and get a better range of the menu. The Henry had at least two veggie/fish options for each course - so it would work well for us. For drinks, I ordered the Final Word (my current favorite drink, which I make at home quite often), she had the Old Fashioned.  Hers was perfect. Mine was a bit heavy on the chartreuse, so I sent it back for a touch more luxardo to balance it out - then it, too, was perfect! For the appetizers, we split the salad (spinach, roasted beet, fennel, stone fruits, puffed grains, goat cheese, and pistachio) and the smoked salmon (potato hash brown, creme fraiche, and arugula). Both were good portions, both fresh and very tasty. The salmon was saltier than it should have been - almost like the chef forgot smoked salmon is already salty, and added a pinch too much as final seasoning. But the flavor was dead on, and the overall construction of the bite was fantastic! Our entrees were the sweet pea tortelli and the salmon, served with quinoa, beets and arugula. The pasta was light and well made, the flavor rich and delicate, and the sauce was creamy without being heavy - the best part was the fresh sweet pea flavor in every bite. I'm not even a fan of peas, and I could have eaten a vat of this! The salmon was a bit of a letdown. There was nothing wrong with it, but it was just really average. The quinoa was stellar (if I could only get my version at home to be so good!), and I love beets in just about any dish - these were incredibly fresh and perfectly roasted. Dessert was bread pudding and the lemon meringue tart. Both were well executed and worth enjoying every last bite of. I can't pick a favorite between the two - they complemented each other perfectly, along with a cup of fresh coffee. I don't think either would have been quite as good without the counterpart. I liked the setup. It feels classic and comfortable; the patio will be fantastic in just a few weeks when the evenings are nice again. The tables and booths are large and spacious - and at a decent distance from each other so you don't feel you have to speak over the neighboring conversations. The regular menu prices are a bit higher than they need to be (keeping format with the other Fox restaurants), but not so high I would decline an invite back. It may not make it to my regular rotation, but I will happily go back for more meals.",

I have tried something different each visit (which have been many)  and have never been disappointed, but very pleased, as well as everyone in our party.The carmelized broiled grapefruit on their breakfast/lunch menu is a winner; the coffee cake is outstanding and their entrees are equally as good. Kudos to Managers Doug and Nate and their staff.  They are a very well-trained crew and do an outstanding job.  This is definitely on our list of favorite restaurants.",

What really bothered me about this restaurant is the brunette morning manager who is obviously completely miserable, gossiping about the company/other managers, servers etc. with customers at tables next to customers that are obviously not deaf.. Professional, right?! And do not ask her for anything when she drops off your food- her annoyance is palpable.",

Service was so slow, it took 40 minutes for our first drinks  to be received, it was an hour by the time our appetizers hit the table, which was the same time the other half of our drinks came to table. It was a chore to track down our server, when we asked someone else for help it happened to be manager... His level of concern was underwhelming and he offered to buy my drink, which he did... But on a 300 tab it was tough to notice, when all 6 of us received poor service. This place could easily be a 4 or 5 star rating, food no complaints, atmosphere awesome and what you expect with a fox concept, service needs extreme improvements.",

I came here on a Sunday without a reservation, which is something I never do.  I was told that I would have a table in 20 minutes as I was the only person in my party. 45 minutes later I asked the hostess if she knew how much longer and she sat me outside where people wait for takeout at a table that was a wet. When I asked if I could sit at a drier table, she told me that I am lucky I was sitting at all and put down some napkins. When I asked if I could order takeout, she answered no and walked away. 20 extra minutes went by and just as I was about to walk out, a waiter asked if I had already received my food. When I told him no and that I was waiting for someone to take my drink order, he immediately sat me at a STILL EMPTY dry table, rushed my food, and comped it. I tipped him the entire amount of what my bill would be. Fox has so many amazing restaurants, maybe they could teach their college age hostesses to be a little kinder to all customers so they don't scare regulars away.",

There were eight of us so we literally ordered every appetizer available and  the wild mushroom  tortelli as well to try. All of them were great, really delicious. My entree was the star of the show however. A pork chop that was both smokey and succulent atop spinach and a cauliflower polenta that was out of this world. The pork was Niman Ranch the best meat you can buy and you could tell !!  The service was spot on.  It was very noisy in there but we were seated next to the open kitchen .I am sure there are more quite sections. I  highly recommend The Henry and  cannot wait to go back and try some of the other enticing options on the menu.",

Between us we tried 3 - none of them were that great and I couldn't even finish mine.  Had the popovers and brie toast - just ok.  Our server was inattentive and eventually went MIA so we had to hunt her down just to pay.  The hostess stand is in front so people linger by it and crowd the chairs in the lounge.  Bar was full but I'm not sure I'd want to sit on those odd, cheap looking bar stools anyway.  The patio looked like it might be interesting when it warms up - I think it has views of Camelback albeit looking over a parking lot.  Problem is there would be no good food or drink to have while you are sitting there!",

The impeccable service was somewhat \"marred\" by the \"tall, slender, very pretty \"blonde\" at the coffee bar area.  We walked in not knowing what to expect, and she asked, \"if we we dining or just having a coffee?\".. We hesitated, and talked it over between us for about 10 seconds which seems to \"upset\" her, as when we told her we would like to dine in, she \"ROLLED HER PRETTY EYES\" as though it irritated her that we did not know immediately.  We really didn't since this was our first visit.  She actually walked away and told us to walk over to the Hostess area to the left.....Rude, and unlike anything that Fox Concepts would consider great service.  The Hostess was great, and the food was great.  The waitress was the same, as it seemed that she \"really didn't want to be there\".  She had no suggestions, no input and not even a \"smile\" and had to ask for water and a refill on my ice tea...  Rude help, and surprisingly as we later found out that it is a \"training center\"?...Love the place though and we probably \"might\" go again, but ...without a \"welcome greeting, and better service, we'll pass on it and just stick to North or Olive and Ivy.  The \"blonde\", let me say again was just to rude, and she made me feel \"unwelcome\".......Other than the service personal, everything else was too neat!....",

    "text": "We have gone to the Henry a few times and always had a wonderful time.  We decided to share our love for the Henry with some friends a week before Xmas.  The experience was not good but we decided to over look it as a fluke.    June 25th, a Sunday, we returned.  We had a reservation which we have never done in the past.  We sat and waited for 20 minutes to be seated and we were not offered a cocktail from the bar (in the past we were always greeted and offered a drink).    When we finally were seated, we sat for another 10 minutes waiting for water and our server!     Finally we placed our drink order... and waited another 10 minutes just to get our cocktails.  This was on a Sunday when the restaurant was not busy.    Due to all the waiting around and a staff unaware of our pressence we were fuming.  However, Gray Goose can fix anything right?  We decided we would cool down and maybe it would get better.  The Gray Goose didn't help and our server never returned!   We finally were approached by a different server who saw me staring at her every time she walked by.  Generally she would avoid eye contact which was highly annoying because it was clear by my body language I wanted to talk with her.   She asked if we needed anything on about her 10th pass by us.  We explained we didn't know what happened to our server.  She then said she would just take over.  It was apparent to her that were were not happy and she seemed annoyed to take on an extra table.  She asked what we'd like to order and I politely told her that we would just take the check for the drinks.    She then replied in barbie dream girl fashion - Ooh Kay!    I found it appalling how we were treated and we will NEVER GO BACK! I regret telling so many people about this place.",

We ordered a couple small plates which were quite tasty as well. The guacamole and pot stickers came out and were fresh and delicious. I had to try the croissant cinnamon roll. Holy mackerel! That roll is one scrumptious item. We also shared the bagel and lox plate. Interesting presentation. The bagel came completely assembled as a sandwich. I'm used to putting the ingredients together myself.  So, if everything is is so good, why 4 stars? First impressions, right? When we arrived, there we two very nice and lovely young ladies tending the hostess stand. After standing politely for several minutes on of these aloof young ladies finally turned around to see what they could do for us. I dunno. A table, perhaps? Did they bother to take a name? Nope.

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Sam Fox, the man knows what he's doing.  The Henry follows the model of all his other restaurants with a more upscale neighborhood feel - above average food at a price point just a tad higher than the competition.  Add the cool atmosphere and some little personal touches, and that's what makes this man so successful.  My wife thinks this is the best brunch in the Valley.  It is, indeed, a very good brunch.  They have a Bloody Mary cart available to make your own Bloody Mary Creation.  My wife raves, RAVES, about the carrot cake pancakes.  It is thick and cakey and not too sweet and really quite tasty.  I opt for savory dishes and have had the chicken fried chicken (crispy and good), the original egg sandwich (very messy, filling, and good), and the Le Pig sandwich (actually lighter than the egg sandwich and also quite tasty.)  Get the popovers.  Cheesy, salty, with ham butter.  Get them all the time.  The roasted chicken with sides is one of the better roast chicken dishes we've had (not including Peruvian or Cuban chicken, both superior.)  The roast chicken here compares well with the chicken at Ocotillo, moist and flavorful.  I would skip the Korean style skirt steak.  It's barely reminiscent of Korean food (except for a hint of smokiness in the meat) and was under-seasoned for something that bills itself as Korean, especially in the meat department.  My wife often gets the branzino, which she has always enjoyed - never overcooked.  And the pork chop here is huge.  It is not butterflied and still cooked well all the way through.  The cauliflower \"polenta\" is one of the best side dishes I've ever had.  Get lots of drinks too.  Their cocktails are pretty tasty, they have a decent brown liquor selection (not as good as The Gladly), and there are enough wines on their list to pair with whatever is on the menu.  Good solid food, upscale local joint, one of the best concepts that Fox has to offer.",

Nothing extraordinary just ok.  I had the Korean prime skirt steak: could not finish it.  The meat was chewy the rice greasy.  Not horrible but not good either.  My husband had the branzino and again underwhelming.  I had the molten peanut butter cake and I came to the Same conclusion: the cake was on the dry side and it was below average. I did not finish it and I love dessert.  We left disappointed and not wanting to come back, not worth the money.  ( we also had the only bottle of champagne they had on their wine list and again not great).  We gave it a try and would not recommend it.  Too bad the place is beautiful.",

Annoying but totally NOT the Henry's fault.   This place reminds me of the perfectly manicured gastropubs back in Boston. All with great cocktails and american fare.   Coming from NYC, I enjoyed the flashback and my food was good. The cocktails were above average and totally resonable in price. The Gimlet was perfection.   My BF loved his french dip sandwich and my \"Greek ingredient\" salad was good...but it was small. The hallumi cheese was not plentiful at all, which was a bummer, because that's why I got it. All in all, though, it was fresh and tasty.",

We also ordered the popovers, unfortunately they were delivered slightly cold, tasted old/stale...these had obviously been made earlier and just (almost) reheated.  We alerted the waiter and he took them off the bill, though he questioned several times what was wrong with them and although we told him the first time, it was almost if it wasn't an acceptable answer.  For our main dishes we both got the bolognese, which was absolutely delicious. The pasta was perfectly seasoned, not too much sauce to drown out the flavor of the pasta, and a dollop of cheese on top.  Oh man, so good.",

I was not aware of making reservations, next time, it will be smart to do so.   When we were seated, we had two waitress name Jenna and Cathy- I think Jenna was training Cathy as a server. Anyway, they were both courteous, nice, and gave a really good descriptions on the whole menu, as this was my first time here.   I ordered two appetizers, a salad and two mimosas. The appetizers were Rib Eye Potstickers which was a very strong BBQ taste to it. Definitely not a an appealing taste. On the other hand, Salmon bits were to die for. Every single bite, I was sad that it was gone. Luckily, there are 4 bite size and it was very satisfying. My main course- Turkey Salad was scrumptious! I would definitely buy it again. Lastly, the two mimosas was very delish!   Overall, with the server, food, and overall service, I will go again in a heart beat.",

Probably bc I told the waitress to omit the raisin based sauce on it... But she told me it wouldn't take too much away from the dish... Think she was wrong on that one. Another let down was the poppets... They put emphasis on this item on the menu so I was disappointed that no one at our table of 4 enjoyed it.   Later that week I spoke to several ppl who have been here and they had one thing in common to say about The Henry... \"You don't go there for dinner, you go there for their brunch menu.\"  Haha whoopsies...

Service -  We made reservations through the Yelp app the morning before arriving at 1230 and let me tell you.. it was the best plan ever. They were busy on that Saturday of course and people were being quoted an hour to an hour and a half wait!! The waitress was attentive and even clarified things (like if I eat eggs) when I notified her I was vegetarian.   Food -  I got the huevos rancheros and yum yum yum! I asked for cholula just in case it wasn't spicy enough for my liking; however, the roasted red salsa had just enough of a kick to it. It comes with a side of potatoes.   We also got the truffle fries. They were good but the truffle dipping sauce was uh-maze-ing I couldn't stop eating the fries solely because of it!   My boyfriend got the chicken fried chicken and said it was a typical dish. Didn't really stand out and probably wouldn't order it again.   They have a Bloody Mary table side cart which was really cool! My boyfriend had one but I wasn't able to because of the Worcestershire sauce in their house mix but it looked yummie!",

I understand they are busy but my last 2 visits here, it took almost 10 minutes before the server greeted us and them several minutes before our order was taken. In fact, when we were in today, the server would stop by the table to bring water and immediately turn around and leave before we could ask for apps. If we hadn't been so insistent we wouldn't have gotten apps. To the restaurant this should be alarming. If a customer is ready to spend $, you should be ready to take it   ***btw.

Again, same problem. Blueberry dessert brought to the table without utensils. Again persistent efforts and attempting to get wait staff attention. Paying the bill took over 20 minutes because wait staff said he would come back but did not. Two hour dinner. Noise was so loud that one could only hear the person directly in front of them and not the others at the table. Smell from burning charcoal or oven filled our area of the dining room.

So my experience was subpar. I won't complain and I always give the server/restaurant the benefit of the doubt but my first experience was so bad that it was funny. My friend was ordering tea and had 3 different servers come back 4 different times before he got the tea. He asked a server that came over what tea they had, the server said \" I don't know, let me grab another server\", 2nd server came and he asked what tea do you have, server said \"let me see the menu\" Came back a few minutes later and my friend said Pearl Green Tea. The 3rd server, Our original server, comes back now and asks I heard you want tea, which tea do you want and my friend says again Pearl Green Tea and we finally get the tea.  There were many experiences like this on Saturday and the place wasn't too busy, but I wasn't going to give the server a hard time. Although it was a little frustrating, I just laughed it off.   I ordered the spicy chicken scramble and it was pretty basic and nothing special nor good and i don't think it was worth the money.  My friend ordered the fried chicken waffle and said the gravy had no flavor and had to ask for some salsa to give some flavor the meal.  I would have to say my favorite part of this brunch was my Fresh Squeezed IPA haha",

The food was great but I was not happy where they sat us after I requested something special due to our anniversary. Also, I would not have chosen if I knew the noise level was going to be that high. And one last thing - I know it is in Arcadia but how do so many families afford to take children to a rest of this caliber with a high price point? They have a pisco sour drink which is to die for.",

    "text": "The Henry is Arcadia's elegant twin to Scottsdale's oh-so-scenester Olive & Ivy.  Where Olive & Ivy is flamboyantly contemporary, boisterous, and as loud as it can possibly be,  The Henry is cleverly Olde English Riding Club, self consciously refined and keeps its volume well under control (all without being stuffy, however).  Both are phenomenal places to get together with friends, it's just The Henry exudes a more intellectual and intelligent atmosphere while Olive & Ivy is about letting your inhibitions drop as much as you can in public.  I love them both.  The food is spectacular at both.  Just know that The Henry is the place for young hipsters who want to act like Old New York Moneyed types, and Olive & Ivy is for affluent Middle Aged professionals who want to enjoy playing at being Kardashians.   Get into the right mindset and you'll have a fantastic time at either one!",

    "text": "Excellent food, excellent service, lovely atmosphere, highly recommend.  We went on a Saturday night and the attire was dressy casual, there were lots of people in designer jeans and dress shorts and nice sandals.  Everything we had was delicious and I highly recommend the potstickers, the dip, Skirt Steak (which I normally only eat Filet, but I have to say this was tender and delicious, not your normal skirt steak), the braised short ribs and you HAVE to order the Peanut Butter Banana cake - yum, I can still taste it, was so good.  They have many vegetarian options, my friend LOVED the Quinoa Tacos.  It is good for groups, couples, friends, etc.  I saw a family eating on the outdoor patio with their kids(it was early like around 5pm).  Really nice choice and not as expensive as you would think it would be.  Appetizers and salads range from $11-$14.  Entrees from $22.  Well worth it.  It was a bit loud in there, was fine for talking to the friend next to me, but was hard for the person across the table to hear us.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Ok....went here yesterday for a birthday celebration with party of eight. Asked for waters for all...two people were brought water. Finally, all of us received water, after asking once again.  I ordered Cab Sauvignon wine and was poured a white wine...which I refused. My husband ordered a second can of Hef beer (they only have four beers on tap - the rest is canned or bottled)...when he ordered a second, he showed the server his can and she SNARKELY said \"Sir, I KNOW what you ordered.\" My husband and I exchanged glances.   When the bill came, I grabbed the calculator on my phone....and figured out what my husband and I owed....then added up what everyone else put on the table so that we could leave our server a 20-25% tip. It added up. Then a SECOND person at our table added everything up...came out the same. When all was paid, the server was sent BACK to our table because her manager said we didn't leave enough money to cover the bill and leave a tip!  The manager then came over to speak with us.  HOW, when TWO separate people added everything up prior to giving our money to the server, we agreed  that there was enough to cover the bill AND leave a nice tip????  I have NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN TO ME.  We have two daughters in the food industry and KNOW the importance of leaving a generous tip.  My husband and I frequent the Fox Restaurants often as we support local. HOWEVER.... After this experience it is doubtful that we will eat at another Fox Restaurant for a long time.....there are other locally-owned places to spend our time and money....LGO and Chelsey's Kitchen, Upward Foundation's Postino, Federal Pizza, JoyHouse Taco, and Windsor, Oregano's, Bianco Pizza, Cibo, etc., where our money, and our friend's and coworker's money can be spent and we won't have this kind of treatment.   SHAME ON THE HENRY STAFF.... This was not a good ending to an enjoyable night out with friends. I LOVED the decor and feel of this restaurant, however it was so loud that we had to shout across the table to talk.... the service was so-so.... the food was GREAT!",

We shared the braised beef pot stickers and I could have eaten an entire bowl of them. We also shared the Brussels Caesar salad which was good. My husband loved the Korean skirt steak. I got the branzino and it was very good, not the best I've ever had but still good. This is a great place to take out of towners when you want to impress but not break the bank.

    "text": "Amazing. Delicious food. Fabulous service! I was visiting family in the west valley but luckily was able to bring them out to the Scottsdale/Camelback area this weekend to sightsee and try this fine dining restaurant. I had never heard of the Fox Restaurant Concepts because I am from the east coast, but I could not help but want to try all of his restaurants to see inside his imaginative mind! First of all, the design--interior/exterior, was amazing! Very modern but also felt homelike with a nice industrial feel but the art was much more old fashioned. The bathrooms were very clean and nice as well as the tables and booths. It was very open and I felt very airy and free in the dining room. What was extremely nice was the fact that the kitchen was ALL open! Customers could watch the cooking and it felt very comfortable knowing that I could see how they prepared each meal. Normally these open kitchen setups would appear loud and obnoxious as a normal kitchen would be but this arrangement didn't seem that way! The people at the table next to us were louder than the kitchen 2 feet away! Next-- the service! It was so pleasant! Our waitress was so sweet and very open to talking about food and the area as well as her home town of New Jersey. All of the waiters/waitress were dressed in the same outfits and it looked very put together and added a nice touch. The manager was very nice as well as the other waitstaff. I definitely had a good experience with the customer service. Lastly, food and pricing. This is definitely a place were one wouldn't go on a regular basis. This is a FINE DINING restaurant so if one comes in expecting a cheap meal this may not be a place for you! But it wasn't unreasonable either. Entrees ranged from 15-25 dollars and sandwiches were anywhere from 10-15 dollars. The food was so appetizing, from presentation to taste Fox really knew how to prepare a meal! I came in very hungry and came out fuller than the moon that night! I recommend this restaurant to anyone if they'd like to a have a great experience in fine dining, fabulous customer service and delicious food!",

We started out with the popovers with the smoked ham butter, and WOW, don't let the idea of ham butter throw you, they were amazing. I had the roasted brussels sprout chicken caesar salad and it was probably the best salad I have had in years. The wait staff was well presented and very attentive, including other waiters who stopped by when our drinks were in the \"danger zone\" to make sure we were doing okay and to see if we needed another one. They also took the time to tell us about their weekend specials and where they were opening locations in the future.",

We sat outside and a server arrived promptly to take our drink and appetizer order (the cheddar popovers and a beer). I order the C. B. & Rye. It had a large portion of corn beef and the rye was nice and crispy. The cabbage and onions balanced the while thing out.  Overall, the service and food were excellent.

My other friends and I were skeptical as a pork chop has never been high on our list of things to order in a restaurant.    As we walked in, we were pleasantly surprised by the inside.  We liked the decor a lot.  It appeared that there was a coffee/pastry bar right in front with a lounge area with sofas, chairs and coffee tables.  Looks like a great place to grab a cup of coffee in the morning!  We were seated fairly quickly and were greeted by our server Caroline.  She was really nice and we all joked about how we wanted to be friends with her and we should just ask her to sit down with us.  We ordered drinks.  I got Henry's Private Island which was fruity and delicious.  It went down very quickly!  =)  Caroline heard us cheering our friends birthday and quickly came over to wish her a happy birthday.  So nice!    For appetizers, we ordered the kale and garlic dip which was amazing!  We devoured it.  For our entrees, everyone except for me ordered the pork chop.  I ordered the short rib and planned to share with a friend so we could try both.  We received the meals and I thought that the short rib was great.  But then I tried the pork chop.  WOW!  The pork chop was amazing!  Two of my friends stated that this was one of the top 10 best meals that they have ever had!!!  I have to agree as well!  It was at least two inches thick which I've never seen before.  It wasn't dry at all.  It was moist and the flavor went all through the meat.  So delicious.    For dessert, we shared the sweet potato semifreddo which was yummy.  We also got the salted caramel ice cream.  Amazing!  My Phoenix friends commented that it was better that the salted caramel ice cream that they get at their favorite local ice cream place.    Overall, we all really enjoyed our meal.  The food was delicious and the service was fantastic.  I can't wait to go again the next time I'm in Phoenix.",

The short rib was fair but nothing memorable.  There's a coffee bar inside the place which adds a nice touch. The Butcher was good.  I had also a home made soda (pineapple) which was really tasteful.   Be aware that this place is a little pricey for what you get.  I talked to a friend of mine about this place and she said that when she went there were bugs everywhere. When she said that I remembered that while I was waiting for my friend I saw a tiny spider descending and landing right at my table. Yes, I wacked it. Shame on me.  If you don't expect much food wise, this is a really nice place.  Cheers",

    "text": "I have not been to a FRC yet that I have not loved! Since I used to live in this area, this is where I often come back to for trendy dining and watering hole options. I had been wanting to try The Henry for some time now and a girls night last week lead us here, finally!  Apparently we entered into the less crowded area right of the coffee bar thinking we were sneaky in beating the crowded door. Ha! After being by passed by the wait staff a few times, one of us got up and went to the bar to see why. Well, duh. We were in the coffee area! Silly girls. We moved to the crowded area and started our wait like everyone else when some sharply dressed guys took pity on us and offered up their high table. Nice! We were quickly greeted by a friendly waitress who cleaned and dried the table. A plus, because anyone who is a frequent diner knows this doesn't always happen and you end up that way! This waitress was informative, spot on with her service, sweet and attentive.  We started out with the Vodka and Pulp from the intriguing cocktail menu that features fresh cocktails and even a handful of soda and juice mixology's that are sans alcohol. Perfect for the one third of us that is starting her family. For the other two thirds of us: The Vodka and Pulp was a refreshing mix of Ketel One vodka muddled with a citrus orange press and topped with club soda served up so nicely in a tall glass. Perfect on a hot desert day! The Red Stiletto was as pretty as it sounded. Belvedere vodka mixed with grenadine and cherry bitters in a old fashioned champagne glass.  We moved on to our starter of the Wood Grilled Artichoke. The artichoke is grilled to perfection to the middle of the tender heart and served with a perfect truffle alioli. It could easily be shared or as a meal for one. My friends ordered the Short Rib Potstickers with ponzu and sesame. There were four of them and they raved over how good they were. Our main meal consisted of us all ordered the Roasted Turkey French Dip. I had the kale salad as side and again, that was a hit. I even took half the sandwich home for the next days lunch.  The wifi was fast and had a strong signal the entire time we were there. That is a plus, as no one can be far from their smart phones or emails these days.  I would loved if The Henry had valet parking because it was seriously hard to find parking on a busy Thursday night. Again, a first world problem! That is not enough to deter me from coming back to The Henry and trying out the coffee bar and more of the innovative menu. I loved the vibrant decor and the atmosphere, just as much as I love all the other FRC places in the valley!",

I don't know why I even try to order something hot, because I have tried five times, and they have never gotten it right.  The pastries are fine, so stick with those.  But if you want something more, pick a better restaurant.  This would just get one star based on food alone.  The ambiance gives it another, though.",

Once a waiter did come (I don't think it was even his table) we told him we actually needed dessert menus instead of the dinner menu. While he did bring us waters and new menus, he did not return to take our orders within the ten minutes more that we waited. The plan was to tell a staff member about how bad the service was, but there was no one to be found.   We were extremely disappointed and decided to leave.",

The girl working at the coffee counter was helpful. The husband had a latte and I got the butcher ( two shots of espresso topped with coffee and sweet cream). Weirdly enough, the two drinks tasted very much the same... they both were overly acidic and just not terribly pleasant to drink. I would like to come back here to try the food/drinks, but for coffee... I don't think so.",

The music is audible but not blaring which is a nice change from other trendy restaurants.  Its loud with people sounds but not overpoweringly.  This is a great place to sip cocktails and enjoy a leisurely dinner.  We tried the appetizer of the day which was short rib potstickers and also the smoked salmon appetizer which is basically a potato hash with sauce, smoked salmon, and arugula on top.  The impressive thing about both these dishes was that the potstickers and the potatoes were fried to an even browned crisp almost to the point of burning but not having a bit of black anywhere.  Perfectly browned and even.  They were both pretty good, but slightly on the salty side.    We also tried the burger with the kale and apple slaw.  The burger was slightly above average.  Cooked well, nicely sized, not overly greasy.  It could have used some onions I think, maybe some pepper.  It was decent with the slaw and sauce on it.  Pretty good bun too.  The roasted chicken was also a good dish.  Relatively moist and maybe a little too salty.  We got the smashed potatoes and mac and cheese as sides.  Both were delicious, but the mac and cheese is probably one of the best I've ever had.  So why the 3 stars?  Service was so slow.  They were nice and all, and there were 4 different people that came around, but every step took a long time to ask for and then attain.  Definitely not for the impatient or those having a busy day.",

We were greeted by a really nice hostess and she right away told us about the wait time as she told us to get a drink at the bar and make our self's comfortable in the waiting area. We did, and the time went by really fast.  The atmosphere was amazing.   The interior design was right in our back yard. Music was perfect and drinks from the bar were the bomb.   40 minutes later, we were escorted to our table on their patio area. It was perfect. The weather outside was perfect and atmosphere was divine.   My boyfriend ordered Roasted Turkey French Dip and I ordered Warm Salmon salad. We shared and we were both stoked. Every bite was so delicious. We did not want it to end. For drinks we ordered Upstate Gentleman and Old Fashion. Yummmm  We are going back for sure and would recommend this place to any of our friends. The only disappointment we had was the fact that we waited this long to go when it is so close to us.   Thanks to all \"The Henry\" staff!",

Entrees included burgers, blackened chicken, and a pasta dish with Brussel sprouts and a cream sauce. We all enjoyed the dishes. Too full for dessert and had a place to be so we didn't linger long. A great place for a casual dinner or a special occasion, we'll be back.  The only down side is that I was not wowed by the menu. I found something I enjoyed, so was happy.

I swear I was kidnapped and transported right into a Polo catalogue. It's got a cool layout and the patio is nice with a pretty great view.  The yelp said it was $$ and the menu actually says it's $$$. Which is fine. Well, by fine I mean money is worth spending on goods and services that have an equal and fair market value. Half a butterflied chicken breast an two 4oz sides should not equal $18.   If you go here and you like artichokes. They have grilled ones. If you don't get them. You will feel like you are missing something.. Like how it feels when you lose your keys.  They were perfection on a plate. I would go back for these.   I ordered dessert. The menu said chocolate cake!! What! Who tha! Yes come to pappa.  When the cake was delivered it was shoved in a small mason jar thingy. Ok cool, be hip and innovative and all that but what happened to being amazing first, like pre innovation? Chocolate cake. Bake the thing and slice it, then put a slice on my plate. If you do simple amazing it doesn't seem so simple.   Overall the experience was a welcome one. Ohhhh wait. Let me back that thing up. So it was not busy, yet from the moment of inception till the moment of completion took almost two hours. 30 mins of that was spent waiting for the check.  Ehhhh to sum this up- \"meh\"  And I'm out!  Signed The Sarcastic Truth Villain...",

At first, I was a bit put off by how boring and minimal it was. The descriptions are horrible so ask the staff (if you can find them. More in that later.)

Interior design and decor is cute (as she would say) and sophisticated. Food and service was absolutely amazing.   Everything we ordered was great. We seem to love starting our meals with dips and their Kale and Garlic Dip was an awesome pick. Served with pita, which you can't go wrong with, and wheat crackers, which I thought complimented the flavors of the dip really well. For our entrees, we ordered the Korean Style Steak and the Braised Short Rib. Both were phenomenal. (Note: Our waiter was excellent in describing the entrees. His descriptions were mouth-watering!) The Korean steak was served with fried green beans over vegetable fried rice. It actually had some hints of Vietnamese and Thai flavors, but that just added to how much we loved it. The braised rib was really amazing. I was very impressed with how it was prepared. Already off the bone, and the meat just slides off with each bite. Everything it was served with were perfect, especially the bits of blue cheese.   Drinks selection is quite decent. There were several beers to choose from and the wine list seemed pretty standard for high-end restaurants. In addition is their House Browns. It's a selection of different whiskeys from different regions of the world. We are both whiskey drinkers and practicing connoisseurs (hah!) so we enjoyed that.   Again, service was awesome. Welcoming host and friendly waiter who was very knowledgable about the contents of the menu. When my fiance ordered whiskey and he saw that she didn't really like what she ordered, he immediately offered to replace it with a glass of another type.   Sure it's a bit pricey, but I hope you are aware of that before you walk in. I have nothing negative to say about The Henry. Loved it there!",

We also got no refills during our meal and were served our entrees at very different times. Half of our party received their plates and the rest had to wait another 20 minutes before the remaining people were served. We also ordered the poached egg and asparagus appetizer which we had to send back because the egg white was undercooked and we did not get it back until we got our entrees. Of our party of 10, three of us got the burger and found it to be mediocre. However, the sandwiches were all delicious as well as the guacamole appetizer. The manager was very apologetic and kind about the poor service. Despite the few issues we had I hope the staff was just having an off day because I would like to come back!",

We also made reservations for 9 pm and weren't seated until about 20 minutes after that. I'm pretty sure they confused our party. However, the low tables where you can get drinks were great and overall i really loved the place. I am dying to go get brunch there so i can see it during daylight.",

We had heard goof things and looked forward to some tasty treats. The restaurant is in a very cool spot with big open ceilings. Cool little lounge area in front.  We got there for our 8:45 reservation and were told they were running a few minutes behind. No big deal. Almost 30 minutes later, and getting a little hangry, we finally got seated. I understand people can be slow to finish meals, but 30 minutes after our reservation is a bit much. One of the things I miss from living in Chicago is that we would have most certainly been offered  a cocktail while waiting around for that amount of time. Not to say we couldn't have walked over to the bar, but hey, I only dock half a star. Honestly, the servers here are slow. That's why your reservations back up.   Enough gripes.  Everything else was awesome. They can make a very tasty old fashion. We started with:  The popovers - almost ordered a 2nd round. Super good.  The Brie toast- fresh and light. Really hit the spot.  Entrees:  I had the porkchop. Not my typical order but the yelpers had spoken and they were right. Solid piece of meat. Perfectly cooked. If it were socially acceptable to chew on the bone I would have. Will order again who I got back.  Wife had the spring salad. She really enjoyed it but I honestly didn't pay too much attention. I was focused on the pork.  We also shared a side of Mac and cheese. Delicious! I'm not usually impressed by Mac and cheese but this stuff was done well.  For desert we shared the bread pudding. Could have used a tiny bit more ice cream on top but overall some of the best bread pudding I have had in awhile.  All in all. Great meal. Cool spot. Reasonable prices. Will be back for sure.  Make sure you reservations!",

It wasn't very busy and we were served promptly.  The service was just decent, for example we had to ask to get our water glasses refilled. I ordered their burger with garlic Parmesan fries and it was very good, however it seems that they could have \"upped\" the presentation with something apart from just the burger and the fries.  My fiancee's pasta dish was delicious but extremely small.  It didn't fill her up at all and if I had ordered it I would have been more than disappointed.  We mentioned this to our server who said that he would inform the chef.  Before we left a female host came up and apologized and offered to comp us dessert or a drink, which we declined.  That was a very classy and highly appreciated gesture.",

When we got there they hadn't changed the reservation time and had nothing available for us. This was supposed to be a special night for my aunt and uncle's anniversary. Also, there was no seating in the waiting area and my husband is disabled and can only stand for a short period of time. While we were waiting, a bartender came up to us and asked if he could take our drink order, which is the only thing that kept us from walking out. (So, thank you bartender with the glasses.)     Neither of the managers by the hostess station even acknowledged anything was going on, even though I went up there multiple times to check on our status. By the third time up, they finally sat us or else we just would have left.   We ordered a salad that  we never got and the manager never came over to our table to apologize for the reservation mix up or offer us anything! I feel like we would have got better service at a lower end restaurant.  I went back the next day to talk to a manager to see if the salad was on our bill and while he was very nice, we still didn't get any compensation.  I will only come back here if friends really want to go, but will never come here again for a special occasion. Which is sad because it's such a cool place.",

I'm allergic to nuts, so I came to the conclusion that something from another dish must have gotten into mine. I told the waitress about it and she offered to take the french toast off the bill.   I'm still giving this place 4 stars because my mom and sister both said it was the best food they have had in a while - but if you have allergies just make sure you inform your waiter or you may have the same issue.",

The initial greeting of the table took a bit longer than it should have, but the cocktails were worth the wait. We started with the popovers which were so flaky, light, and delicious. The ham butter was phenomenal. We tried the roasted chicken and the short ribs which were both such great choices. So much flavor, and the sides fit both dishes so well.   Our server Chelsea was SO helpful in picking dishes, and had a genuinely helpful attitude. The dinner was paced out so nicely, and made the experience even better.   The Henry definitely has everything to keep me coming back for more! Great decor, wonderful menu, good music, delicious food, and fabulous details like their antique looking martini glasses and beautiful silverware",

It was a Thursday night, and it was still lucky we had reservations; especially while the hype is high, this place is hoppin'.  We were seated very quickly, and our server walked us through some popular appetizers and beverages.  Though several of the cocktails looked delicious, we opted for their specialty sodas which did not disappoint.  Our server recommended the salmon appetizer, served on potato cakes.  We also got the artichokes, knowing how good they are at the other Fox restaurants.  The salmon was a hit, the artichokes were not what we expected.  I still liked them but the rest of the table wasn't as impressed.  All the entrees were superb.  I had half a chicken with Brussels sprouts and kale/apple slaw, and the slaw was the highlight of an all around great meal.  My fiance's skirt steak was tender and flavorful.  Future Mother-in-Law's Branzino was, according to the fish lovers in attendance, very good.    Dessert was the Peanut Butter Bar dish with chocolate ice cream, which I highly recommend!  Our service was excellent all evening.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is a classy, old-timey place with classic menu selections.  It's definitely a cool place, and I'm sure we'll be back!",

I want to fill up on the actual meat and toppings, not on flour.  The burger comes with grilled red onions and in my opinion, that is a no-no.  I don't like red onions cooked at all, I personally think they should always be served raw.  They will easily do this for you and I am sure if you wanted grilled yellow onions or what not, they would do that for you as well.  The place is very nice inside but you can still go casual here.  I haven't had the breakfast before but it looks like a happening place for it.  They have excellent service as well.",

I ordered the \"flower child scramble\" and substituted pepper jack cheese for the parmesan but the pepper jack that came with the scramble was hardly cheese! It was a single slice placed atop the scramble and had a very plastic-y texture, more like a cheese produce (ie a Kraft single or Velveeta) than actual cheese. Kind of disappointing and underwhelming. Like I said before though, the interior is stunning and it isn't too noisy, nor did I have to wait too long to get a seat, despite the fact that it was a busy Sunday morning. Next time I go I'll try a lunch plate and hope it's better than that breakfast scramble.",

Our server seemed somewhat awkward with her recommendations, but I remained optimistic.  We started off with the duck confit flatbread, and found that the duck was extremely salty.  The date portions were very large and my husband found a pit on one of his slices.  We ordered the shortribs and black cod between the two of us.  Although, I thought the black cod had delicious flavor, it was, again, too salty.  The shortribs were very tender and the texture was perfect, but it lacked depth of flavor, and in this case, lacked salt.    Between dinner and ordering dessert, our waitress actually spilled my fig and mule cocktail.  I told her that it wasn't necessary to replace the drink because I would be ordering wine with dessert but when the check came, she hadn't take off any of the drinks, including the drink she spilled.   We ordered the peanut butter banana cake, which was tasty, but seemed a little disjointed with the room temp cake with frozen chocolate bananas on top.  The best part of my meal was the glass of '11 leviathan red blend that I had with dessert.    Overall, loved the ambiance, decor, and ease of getting our table with our reservation. Disappointed with the server and lack of recognition of her mistakes with the meal.  Also, would have expected more with the meal in general; seasonings were off.  I would be willing to try again for breakfast/brunch.",

I would have loved to know this ahead of time - put it on your website or share this bit of news when I make my reservation. The things I was most looking forward to weren't available. Our waiter was a bit off - was he new? If so, I'll excuse it. But we didn't know his name for about three visits. Water wasn't refilled and coffee was horrible. The table was quite tight for six average adults. What'd we have for brunch? The french toast was average... The bagels were toasted nicely but the salmon was WAY too salty... The quinoa tacos were good but where was the guacamole listed on the menu?? ... The bacon was absolute genius - thanks for that... The crab quiche was the best thing on the table, truly... And the eggs and corned beef - good but no mention on the menu that it would be an omelette. Strange. We loved the popovers for appies and the caramel roll was magnificent. Great vibe here and the hot cocoa made with almond milk almost made up for my disappointment... but not quite.",

I noticed the menu hasn't changed much since the last time I ate there. I ordered the guacamole with chips ($10) as an appetizer. My main lunch was the club sandwich ($13); plus an order of side salad ($5). My friend ordered the scallops. She told me it's very good. My Club sandwich was ok; good portion. The turkey was just turkey ham. I expected it to be real roast turkey (as in Breakfast Club). The side salad was disappointing, just a few leaves next to the sandwich on the same plate. The guacamole was really small portion with a few chips on a narrow dish. All in all, I am not much impressed with the food or the menu. I was hoping for a better selection of food. With these prices, you will get a better quality & quantity somewhere else (I.e. The capital grille).",

Fingers crossed for a daily special. The menu does not identify whether or not an item is gluten free. Being vegetarian AND gluten intolerant the menu seemed very small. The brussel sprout Caesar minus the croutons was good, but not good enough for me to return.   The reason for just 3 stars is the lack of notation on the menu regarding gluten/non gluten items. I can think of at least 2 other Fox restaurants that have updated menus. Also, I attempted to order truffle fries. The very kind waitress went back and forth to multiple times only to find out there is not a separate fryer that is strictly for gluten free items. Clearly this whole gluten thing is a big deal to me, I hoped The Henry cared more about patrons with food allergies-wrong!",

    "text": "Ok. So I actually have to WORK at toning down my excitement about this place. Came upon it by accident today for breakfast, thinking it was a different place I had visited just across the street. Decided to give it a try anyway since I'm always down for a new experience and...  ... ... WOW. Could NOT have been more pleased. The decor, style, and ambiance of this place is right in line with other Fox Concepts, which means that it toes that fine line between quirky and elegant without being overbearing. You feel at once at-home and enchanted.  The Henry was busy when I visited it today (a Saturday) at around 10:30am. In fact, there would have been a 20-30 minute wait for the dining room had I not decided to sit at the bar. Fortunately, the bar and lounge areas are full service, so it worked out very well.  Everything about this place is simply wonderful. The food menu is diverse with notably healthy options. It's clear that a lot of thought went into their food. VERY fair prices, too, considering the portion sizes and mouth-watering combinations. I ordered the Quinoa Breakfast Burrito and savored every bite.  The drink menu is also pleasantly diverse including everything from craft brewed coffee, to special house coffee drinks to truly upscale alcohol offerings. I tend to prefer out-of-the-way single malt scotches and The Henry had it all! I'll definitely be coming back here for a good scotch!  The building is open concept, but it still segments nicely between dining room, bar, coffee bar, and cafe. There's plenty of seating both indoors and on the outside patio, so even when it's busy (like today), it's easy to find a spot and camp out for a while with your laptop if you're into that sort of thing.  Service was outstanding across the board despite the large number of visitors, and everything I ate/drank was phenomenal. I will absolutely be back, and it will absolutely be to introduce new friends to the place. I highly recommend this.  If you haven't been yet - GO! You won't be disappointed.",

My friends ordered salads.  I should have known better than to have ordered this as it was not even close to being a True Bahn Mi sandwich.  It was laden with sauce, soggy bread and just flat out inedible.  I took one bite and didn't touch it again.  The wait person (Jacob) came over a number of times to fill our water but never asked me about my sandwich which I was clearly not eating.  I had also pushed the plate over to the side. Finally as he was clearing the salad plates from my friends I told him to please advise the kitchen that if they are going to put a Bahn Mi sandwich on the menu, they need to know what it should taste like.  Later he came back to see if I perhaps I wanted a pastry!  Really?  I told him it was too late for him to ask me what I would have wanted instead.    Insult to injury, he didn't take my sandwich off the bill which I didn't eat.  If he had done the right thing, I would not be writing this review.  This has left a bad taste in my mouth and I doubt I will go back to The Henry as a result.",

    "text": "My husband and I had heard good things about this place, but overall, left disappointed.   ATMOSPHERE: We had a reservation on a busy Sat. night and were seated right away. Nice. The vibe here is trendy, relaxed, and NOISY. Cool, but almost impossible to have a dinner conversation...maybe the patio would have been better. Nothing wrong with the noise if that's the vibe you're looking for. Maybe just not for a date night away from the kids, where we actually wanted to talk. =)  On to the SERVICE. This was disappointing. We had an emotionless server, whom we rarely saw. When we had a problem with our food the manager should have handled it differently, but chose not to. A better people experience could have left me writing a different review and willing to give this place another shot.   FOOD: We had the brussel sprout caesar salad to start. Not sure if someone accidentally threw the brussel stems in the salad instead of the trash, but that's what we were served. Chewy brussel sprout stems, mixed with radicchio and a few sprigs of romaine.   Next we had the smoked salmon appetizer. This was spot on. Delicious. The potato hash underneath was just the right amount of crispy and salty to go perfectly with the smoked salmon.   I had the blackened Cod entree. YUM. The sauce was so creamy and delicate, and worked nicely with the flakey cod. The \"blackened\" top was so good! I had asked the server for a glass of wine with dinner. The wine came just as I was finished eating (and I am a slow eater).   The big miss was my husbands $47 New York Steak, ordered medium rare. It came out well done. We rarely send food back, but for $47, this steak better have been cooked to perfection - not hard to do. If we'd been at Outback (which we wouldn't be), cool. Let it go. But we expected more. He sent it back and we waited a good 15 plus minutes. I was long done with my dinner, plate cleared already, before they even brought his back out. We got a half-assed apology from whom we think was the manager. That's it. Wasn't expecting a free meal or anything, but something....even legit customer service would have left us feeling ok about the entire night.   There are so many other places out there to try....don't think we'll be back here again. My tip to the manager is - if your back of the house can't deliver killer food, then the front of the house needs to make up for it. Neither happened here.",

    "text": "I'm always up for a new experience. Recently a business associate, who hangs at some very cool places, suggested a meeting at a place with another associate. While I know the FOX Group to be one of THE BEST operations around, I hadn't heard of The Henry so... I was ready. (OK, I don't get out as much as I should)  I got there early and was overly impressed that Phoenix would have such a cool place. Very industrial look mixed with some vintage furniture and enough modern touches to keep it interesting, and comfortable. I thought, with FOX's attention to detail and quality, I knew  THIS is going to be nice.  My associate arrived and asked for \"his table\" in the back. A booth against the back wall that was quiet enough to have our small business meet and greet. As expected, the service was impeccable, and very tolerant as our business gathering of 3 took up some table space during lunch. It definitely warranted a large tip for her patience and gracious service.  And have got to say that the Pastrami sammy was great! Lean but juicy, with a terrific crunchy slaw, tangy swiss and aioli. Generally for me, the bread is there just to hold everything together, so I'm not overly excited about it (unless it's a great \"make you pucker\" San Fran sourdough) but the pretzel roll was just enough without being \"bready,\" distracting, and hiding the goodies inside. The accompanying salad had a light dressing and, while looking a lot like terrific lawn clippings, (just an observation NOT a complaint) it was great addition and compliment to the sandwich.  Combining the class of this place, the most intriguing and interesting surroundings, the professional waitstaff (with the greatest smile), the very tasty food at a decent price... and it's on my \"got to go back list.\" A friend wants to take me out for my birthday so... I think I know where dinner will be.  Can't say enough about the atmosphere and professionalism of this place - just what you'd expect from a FOX operation - and can't imagine you'd ever be disappointed. I'm anxious to try happy hour, see how their Long Islands are and dig into my birthday dinner.  Enjoy!",

The best part of the cake was that it was filled with peanut butter and it paired well with the vanilla ice cream and coffee. I forgot what coffee I ordered but it was pretty strong. Their atmosphere is very inviting, clean, and service was great. This place is a great place to lounge around while enjoying a good conversation with friends or even with your boyfriend.",

I typically get lox and bagels or 2 egg breakfast. The Go North is the best coffee drink I've ever had.   The atmosphere is very comfortable, open and the energy of this place is always buzzing. Usually there is a 20 minute wait without a reservation but they typically have open seating at the bar and couches up front.   They have a really nice Bloody Mary cart on the weekend too.",

    "text": "We came here for Sunday brunch and were extremely disappointed. We went to Los Angeles one which was great and figured we give this location a try. Won't be back here. There were 3 of us and we ordered 2 breakfast dishes and a almond croissant. You would think the croissant is the easiest dish to serve since they already have baked croissants but it was the exact opposite. The other 2 sides were served and 10 mins after that they tell us that they no longer have almost croissants but can bring us a regular croissant. It took them another 15 to 20 mins to bring out a regular croissant. They never refilled our waters and only checked in on us 1 time for a coffee refill. Their excuse was that this is their busiest day and there wasn't communication between the bakery and the rest of the servers. Unacceptable!!!!! If this is your busiest day, then as a leadership team you should be on your A game and be prepared. Overall, when I looked around, there was poor service all over. Very disappointed and won't be back here again. If they can't get a simple croissant right, I don't have faith that they can do anything right. The other 2 breakfast dishes were ok but nothing impressive.   I wanted to provide an update from my prior posting: after I left my review, Brad, the owner, immediately responded, apologized and focused on how he can resolve this issue. I appreciate your sense of urgency, willingness to go above and beyond and caring about the situation Brad. You have definitely turned this unpleasant experience into a great outcome. Really appreciate the way you handled this situation!",

    "text": "On the road for my wife's graduation led me to spin the wheel on Yelp to find the perfect celebratory setting. Thanks to local reviews and photos I made the decision to rsvp at the Henry as this place fit the bill for everything I knew she would enjoy:  Great cocktails, homemade desserts, and unique/seasonal entrees all being served from a spot that looks like it came out of a Restoration Hardware catalog!  As we were a bit early for our rsvp, we were open to enjoying some cocktails in the front until our table was ready. This was the only downfall of our experience as I needed to flag down a waitress before we could get any service. Once our orders had finally been taken and arrived, we started to realize that this place was going to meet the expectations we desired. The fig and gin mules are on point as were the brandied cherries in my wife's drink.  On to the entrees! The perks of going out to dine with a family that loves to eat is that we get to sample everyone's dishes. Our selections included: the Mediterranean branzino, wood grilled pork chop with cauliflower polenta, Thai blackened cod, beef short rib, buttered lobster salad, Korean skirt steak, and orders of bread pudding and chocolate,peanut butter, banana cake!   OH and only the best cheesy popovers you could ever put in your mouth w homemade ham butter. Yes..HAM butter.  We obviously spent a grip but if you're going to do it big then you might as well do it right, and I got some major cred for the night's dinner selection. :)  For a party of 6, this place was impressive the moment you stepped foot in the door. From the open kitchen delivering mouthwatering dishes to the small patisserie on the side, the Henry has something to appeal to a variety of individual tastes.",

    "text": "We visited Scottsdale for our anniversary. The Henry was our first dinner out. A simply PLEASANT experience from start to finish with amazing flavors surrounded by passionate workers.  Our server made multiple outstanding recommendations and even helped steer us away from one that wasn't a specialty of the restaurant. Many servers aren't confident enough to do this.  We started with the short rib potstickers, which were a perfect appetizer. The richness of the reduced ponzu sauce played well with the hearty textured braised meet and dumplings. Fresh cilantro for some life, and the six portion was a perfect lead in to the main courses.  My wife had the mushroom paella w an add on of seared scallops. The layers of flavor were well balanced, mixing in earthy vegetables and a sweet and smoky profile. The scallops were exactly what you want out of a scallop: buttery, salty, and delicious.  I had the ginger glazed, seared cod. It was served with fresh roasted vegetables over a delightful coconut broth. The broth stole the show, so much so that my wife was dipping her scallops in it before long. The dynamic flavor of the broth, underscored by spice and ginger was so subtly delicious and of course the cod was fantastically mouthwatering.  We finished with the house special bread pudding, all scratch made with caramel ice cream. Everything was spot on time wise, and the patio space was inviting and relaxing. Do yourself a favor and indulge.  Only possible complaint was my cod serving size was a little on the lighter side, but I am a Midwestern man, so I think I was just missing my potatoes! 5 stars, go enjoy the flavors and polished ambiance!",

    "text": "Things didn't start off well. We arrived on time for our New Year's Eve reservation only to be told by the host that we would have an additional 45 minute wait for our table. She acknowledged that we might want to leave, but where would we go at 9pm on NYE? So, we waited. There were lots of would-be diners in our situation, so the entrance area was overrun with people waiting - a little like a busy airport terminal. It just felt weird to be all dressed up for a night out and not even have a place to sit and wait for a table that should have been ready. Anyway, once at the table, the service issues began in earnest. Drinks took a long time to arrive, but our app order was taken quickly and came promptly. But then, for some unknown reason, our server simply started to avoid us. We  couldn't give him our main course order because he kept passing us by. The couple who was seated about 10 minutes after us at the table next to us had no trouble making their orders and getting his attention. Eventually, I wandered with the menus back to the host station to make our order. She must have spoken to the server at that point, as he arrived instantly at the table pen and paper in hand. Anyway, long story short, things just took way too long at the Henry and the food was only marginally good. A request for a spare napkin went unfulfilled, a promise of almond-milk ice cream was, in fact, coconut-milk ice cream, the vegetables in the Harvest Bowl were cold in the center, etc. You get the idea: it just seemed like work to be a patron at The Henry. The server's name began with a \"B\" and he really seemed disconnected from what we have come to expect as service at a Fox Concepts restaurant. We won't be going back to The Henry, but I believe the place has merit. We just don't want to risk being burned again.",

    "text": "I've been to the Henry twice for my anniversary as well as my birthday brunch, so my expectations were high for these special occassions. =)   The location is very aestetically pleasing. The outside has some patio seating with some really comfortable outdoor furniture. There is a rather large parking lot for the location and even some space for bicycles in case you bike there from nearby. The decor inside is very well done, gorgeous drapery, lovely tuft couches and very comfortable booths. The colors are blue and earthtones, it feels so welcoming you feel like staying for a while. The kitchen is open, so if you happen to sit near by, you can watch as the dishes are prepared. Note that it does get busy. I am an EARLY bird and have not needed a reservation, however I did notice it get rather full as we ate and there was a wait.   The Henry has a main restuarant as well as a Cafe in the same building. I have not eaten at the cafe part, but I am sure I will. I did order from the bakery at the Cafe, but I am gettng ahead of myself and will describe the macarons I got later.   The staff is wonderful. They are attentive, without being intrusive, helpful and happy to help. I like salsa with my eggs at breakfast and they were quick to bring us a very delicious roasted veggie salsa that was just the right amount of smokey, fresh and spicy! The coffee is delish and probably has something to do with the cafe. I usually will have one maybe 2 cups tops and I had 3 both times I went. I've tried the egg white and turkey omelette. The turkey is made in-house fresh roasted and carved, it was so succulent and well seasoned that it made sense to pair it with eggwhites so that the turkey flavors really stand out. It was served with what they calles smashed avocado; it was reminicent of a chunky guacamole with out lime. I thought that was a nice addition to the omelette. My company had the turkey au jus and LOVED IT. the bread was just the right amount of crusty but so soft in the middle to really soak up all the turkey au jus (which was amazing, so savory and such a comfort food taste given that it was turkey, much lighter than you'd get from beef, but still interesting anf a great addition to the sandwich). I also tried the New Yorker, which was GREAT! They make thier own corned beef, so I suggest your try the omelette or the sandwich as its cooked to perfection, not fatty at all and the kind ofitem you'd wish they sold by the pound to take home.  The portions are generous in my opinion and they are very accomodating with what you'd like and substituing side orders. We tried the grapefruit brulee and it was warm, juicy and the sugar crust cracked with every spoonfu. the caramelized sugar went perfect with the fruit. The desserts were AMAZING, we shared a berry muffin and I could literally smell the butter; it was full of fresh berries as well, so well worth the purchase. I ordered strawberry macarons and they were delightful. The filling was not overly sweet and you could really taste the dab of sweet yet tart strawberries; it really tasted like summer time. My parents tried the bear claw and they highly reccomend it. My mom commented that she was pleasantly surprised by the dash of sea salt carefully dusted over the pastry. While she was not expecting this she mentioned it really added some depth of flavor, brining out the tastes in the the sweet almond filling.   On a side note, I found the restuarant to be a great place to dine whether you are grabbing a quick bite to eat, are heading out with the family including small children or celebrating a special day with your significant other. I have and will continue to go back.",

    "text": "Fox Concepts with another winner here folks. Stopped in with some family for a little Sunday brunch and it was a great experience. It was packed, but with a reservation we got in right away with very little time spent at the hostess stand. The environment is a very modern, almost coffee shop like environment which is very enjoyable for a breakfast/brunch joint!   We started with the white truffle fries which were great despite me not loving truffles! It looked like they had some awesome appetizer options.  My main course was the Huevos Rancheros. The Henry takes a unique stance on the dish and makes it without a red sauce which is a staple in the southwest. I was kind of surprised but it was good enough to make up for no sauce. Plus the black bean puree was tasty and nearly acted like a heavier sauce.   Great spot for brunch/lunch on the weekends. Next time (when I don't go out drinking the night before) I will be sure to try their fully stocked Bloody Mary cart!   Great spot, highly recommended. Also, be sure to be extra basic and take a picture outside the front door next to The Henry sign that is Instagram famous!",

The Food is very good but I just wish there was more choices through out the menu. Took us a bit to decide but the kitchen is quite accommodating for some substitutions. However, the entrees are overpriced indeed. I'm sure we will return as it is a nice place to eat and have a cup of coffee plus the Bloody Mary cart is yummy!",

Several of the items that we wanted to order were not available.  The Grilled and Chilled shrimp, Tuna, and NY Steaks were all out.  It was a very busy Wednesday night but this was very disappointing.  The Restaurant was also extremely warm and my guests all complained of how uncomfortable the evening was.",

To start, the atmosphere is great - beautifully decorated and complete attention to detail.  The service was great too - we were warmly welcomed, promptly seated and helped immediately.    We started our dinner with the cheddar popovers...sinfully good!  They serve them with a ham flavored butter and a fleur de sel - simply amazing!  We both opted for the roasted chicken entree with two picnic sides.  I choose the creamed corn and the mac 'n cheese - wow, both of these were amazing!  My husband chose the mashed potatoes and the cauliflower polenta...the polenta was crazy good!  I am actually craving it just sitting here typing up this review.    I wish we had saved room for dessert as I hear their choices are amazing...next time for sure!  I am excited to come by in the morning and check out the coffee bar and make the work space mine for a few hours...great idea and can't wait to try it out!  Another home run for Fox...way to go!",

Everything was perfection! We were seated right away for our 8:30pm reservation. We were sat at a roomy booth which was perfect for my BF to finish up some work on his laptop. Our server Luci was great! It was her 1st night serving on her own (without a trainer) and she was a gem! Very knowledgeable about the wine and food menu. Fabulous job Luci!  We shared the Smoked Norwegian Salmon appetizer, I had the Roasted Rosemary Chicken with cauliflower \"polenta\" and brussels sprouts and my BF had the Korean Style Skirt Steak. It was all wonderful! We shared the German Chocolate Flourless Cake, which was just OK (I wasn't expecting it to be spectacular without flour...the BF has to eat gluten-free, though) and Salted Caramel Ice Cream...delish! Also had 2 specialty coffees with dessert.  A wonderful dining experience from start to finish and added to our \"Favorite Restaurants\" list!",

I was speaking with a hostess and then the manager just jumps in and says \"well if you want to wait it would be a 3 hour wait\"... a 3 hour wait wow.. I was a little taken back.. I was with my wife, my mother, my grandmother and my children.. I wasn't going to have them wait for 3 hours.. manager lady said she would see what she could do about accommodating us and asked to give her a few minutes. I said ok. I gave her 15 minutes. I went back inside and she said she needed more time to even see if she could seat us an hour later.. At that point I had had enough and took my family to the cheese cake factory where we were seated in 10 minutes...",

    "text": "I absolutely adore The Henry. It's yet another Fox Concept that leaves your tummy full and happy and your inner foodie debating on whether or not to make a return trip the very next day. The decor is absolutely perfect. It reminds me of the perfectly tucked away, industrial-esque Cape Cod home that you escape to when  you're writing your next novel or reinventing yourself after a quarter-life crisis. As lame as it may sound, that's the relaxed energy vibe that I get when I visit The Henry. And trust me, even though I may not be able to portray it well with words, when you visit, you'll understand exactly what I'm talking about.   I've only visited here for weekend brunches, and let me tell you, their brunch menu is unreal. My absolute favorite brunch item is their quinoa breakfast burrito served with breakfast potatoes. It's a Southwest-style burrito with black beans, avocado, and the traditional breakfast burrito fare (eggs, cheese, etc.). But the quinoa added really sets it apart from similar brunch spots. The portion size is very realistic for brunch and for what you pay, and you leave feeling very satisfied. I've also tried their bagel & lox, the huevos rancheros, and the spicy sausage scramble. All of which were well-executed, light enough for brunch but still filling, and some of the best-tasting brunch entrees I've had.   Do yourself a favor and skip their regular drip coffee. It's nothing special. Instead, head over to the coffee bar or have your server order you an Americano. Their espresso is much more smooth and decadent-tasting than their drip coffee. Trust me. You'll see what I mean when you try one of their espresso-made drinks.   The staff is warm and welcoming, but not in the overly-obnoxious way that you get with some breakfast/brunch crews. It seems like the management staff understands that they don't need to hire people who put on fake smiles and turn on fake personalities for tips. They hire people with just the right amount of personality that encapsulate the theme/energy of the restaurant itself. They're there when you need them, and gone when you don't. And for me, someone who's entirely not a morning nor a people person, that's exactly how I like my service.   I loved The Henry so much the first Saturday I visited them for brunch, that I came back the very next Sunday only to be wowed again by their calming ambiance, decadent food, and servers who are by today's definition most definitely a \"whole squad\" that works together \"on that real..\" to keep my experiences at The Henry real. Did I just go there? Yeah. I think I did...",

We decided to share a few things since deciding on one item seemed impossible.  We got the popovers with ham butter (YUP it's a real thing), grilled artichoke hearts, and salmon salad.

    "text": "Overall, I give the Henry a thumbs up.  It was busy when my family I went for lunch and they did not take reservations but my family and I ended up sitting at a table by the coffee bar and did not have to wait.    The coffee at the coffee bar was delicious and a reasonable price, which we ordered while waiting for our food.    For an appetizer I suggest to try the Prairie Breeze Cheddar Popover's which come with smoked ham butter & fleur de sel butter; they ended up being exceptional.   For the entree I ordered the  Mediterranean Chicken salad which was $14 which included cucumber, local tomato, red onion, kalamata olive,toasted almond & feta cheese.  It was also not a disappointment.  The atmosphere had a young and lively feel with mostly attractive in shape people  dining or ordering coffee.  Our server was not the best but she did her job.  I enjoyed the decor of The Henry; very modern and aesthetic.  I suggest to go to The Henry if you have the money and want to have a good time.",

They make their own breads and dressings and as much as they can in-house and offer a lot of different foods and yummy salads! We split a salad and a sandwich and they split both for us! It was definitely enough food. The service was top-notch and accommodating. Great place to go post-workout and for couples or dates! :) Comfy seating, and a great atmosphere! We will definitely be back to try different salads and entrees. The food was delicious! Thank you for a great experience!!!",

The latte was pretty average (eh), on the other hand, the toast was phenomenal.",

    "text": "Visited this establishment for the first time recently. Great vibe. Happening place. One of the best gin and tonics I've had in a long time. So, what's not to like? The menu. We were a party of four. One of us had just come off the golf course and was starving. Sadly, not too much for him to sink his teeth into. There was little on the menu that I personally was interested in. The menu doesn't seem to know what it wants to be when it grows up. The food goes back and forth between American, Asian, Mexican, Italian, etc. Let's start with the appetizers. Spring Vegetable Crudites. I don't know about you, but I personally can't get excited about raw vegetables, crunchy or not, and certainly can't get excited about paying $12 for them. Moving on to the Short Rib Potstickers. Nah, probaby not. Made to Order  Guacomole. We actually ordered this and it was good. Only problem was the serving dish was small and unremarkable. Need to get it into something that would make a better presentation. Also, very few chips. Moving on to the Smoked Norwegian Salmon, need to get this off the menu. No one associates smoked salmon with a lunch menu. It's strictly breakfast or brunch. Warm Parker House Rolls? Hmmm. Wouldn't be my first choice. Warm Kale & Truffle Dip. We didn't have, but doesn't sound too bad. Roasted Chicken Tortilla Soup. When was soup an appetizer? Thought it was usually in a category of its own or under soup and salads. Speaking of soup, they need an alternative soup to the Tortilla soup. A corn soup would be a good alternative. Grilled & Chilled Shrimp. We ordered these and they were actually quite good. Can't say as we cared for the $16 price tag however. One would have thought for $16 the shrimp might have come out on a bed of arugula or something. Finally, the White Truffle Parmesan Fries sounded intriquing. However, one would normally see fries as a side dish, not an appetizer. One of our party ordered a burger with fries, but I don't think the fries were the White Truffle Parmesan Fries. I didn't notice a single pork dish on the entire menu. Pork barbacoa tacos would be amazing. They would cost the restaurant almost nothing to prepare. A few pork butts cooked overnight for less than $20. Sliders would be a great appetizer. Ono, mahi mahi or scallop sliders. Well, the overall impression of our party was that the food here is secondary. It's really too bad as there is so much potential here for an amazing menu. Even though it appears a lot of business people frequent this place, it doesn't mean they can't serve good food? Keep tuned in for my review of the next segment of their menu. Oh, did I mention the tables are small on the East side of the restaurant? I lived in fear the whole time I was going to knock my gin and tonic onto the floor.",

    "text": "Fox does it again!!!!! So if you are not familiar with Fox Resteraunt Concepts and you live in the \"Valley of the Sun\" I demand you get with the program. I have been living in Seattle and missed out on the opening of his Truely chic  new lil  joint. So after bebopping round the city with my Real Estate Agent (see reviews)  He took me here for lunch. What  a treat. I mean it was lunch and I literally had a salad and a drink, but OMG did I have a great version of an old classic and a delectable drink! So let me start with the decor... This place is drool worthy. Sumptuous robins egg blue leather stools, and mustard gold leather chairs (button tufts... SWOOON). Mixed with restoration hardware style worn bomber leather couch/ banquettes, a good mix of raw wood, open duct work, subway tile, and the Phillip Jefferies Rivet Grass Cloth wall paper.... YASSSSSSSSSSSS! Perfect mix of classic and Industrial. I see you Fox...  I SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE you!. I swear I wanna marry the mans brain he has created a team of Master Chefs and Designers that cannot be touched... You are all Gods and Goddesses in my eyes... Now the food I had a brussel sprout ceasar with chicken. the brussel sprouts were cooked to perfect and chilled to a crisp, tossed lovingly, at least in my head,  with a cousin to romaine  called lil gem, radicchio and a very classic ceasar dressing. The chicken on that although grilled tasted almost like it had been smoked over wood so whatever you did there was just brilliant with the brussels. I immediately gravitated to the orange hibiscus cooler for a drink... I mean I am a sucker for hibiscus, but there was no room for disappointment... I literally asked for a to go cup... and I do not know who this Hank who creates this is, but he is a GOD too. I cant wait to come back and test out an espresso from what looked to be the Bentley of Coffee Machines. My agent had a Seared Ahi salad, and although I cannot attest to the taste, I can tell you it looked like was cooked exactly how Ahi should be...  I LOVE YOU FOX RC!!!!!!!",

    "text": "We went on a Saturday morning/afternoon (got there at 11:30 and ate around 12:00) and had about a 30 minute wait.  We chose this place based on a recommendation from a friend.  During our wait we walked through to the coffee shop and had a chai, a mocha, and shared a (giant) peanut butter/chocolate rice krispy treat.  Our server was AWESOME!  I asked for no bacon on my egg sandwich, and he immediately offered the bacon as a side to my bf.  (Major points.)  He noted we already had drinks from the coffee shop and asked if we would like additional beverages or if we would like new ones.  He shared his opinions on some of the items we ordered (bruleed grapefruit is a WIN, people!) and was attentive but not annoying through the whole meal.  They serve their chicken fried chicken a bit differently than most places (biscuits, chicken, fried egg on top).  At first bf wasn't sure... and then he ate it \"as served\" and it was gone in under 10 minutes.  ALL OF IT.  I ordered the egg sandwich, as I previously mentioned, without bacon and it was SOOOO delish.  I will say the presentation had me skeptical (the bread looks hard).  The bread is melt-in-your-mouth amazing!  The side of breakfast potatoes were just right.  Again, don't skip the bruleed grapefruit side though!  We will be back.  It's a bit of a \"treat\" because it's not super cheap... but it is worth the Saturday morning breakfast wait (more so than most other places).  Yum!!!",

    "text": "My friends decided to have lunch here after a business meeting, and I've never heard of the place so I was really up for anything. I hadn't realized this was a fox concept restaurant, and also that their headquarters were upstairs. Pretty cool. Went inside, was greeted for lunch and were asked if we would like to be seated or order at the counter, we went ahead and got full service for lunch. I LOVE LOVE the decor inside, and with that just alone I would bring someone in to try. We were seated by the hostess right away, but we had to ask for our server to get our order after a good 10-15 mins. They sent a server right away, and we ordered a wild mushroom pasta, turkey french dip, and a bolognese. Our food seemed to take a little longer than usual, as we saw new people sit down next to us and get served, finish their food and servers pick up their plates. A chef came by, noticed our food was taking a little longer therefore gave us some in house guac and chips and apologized. That was nice of them! :) It was delicious too. I liked the wild mushroom pasta I ordered, but the sauce was a bit on the heavier side for me for white sauce. I tried my friend's bolognese, and loved that I could taste the truffle oil on it! I tried the wildflower coffee drink after, so I wouldn't get food coma, and food coma never came! I was so wired and it was so good, definitely recommend it, but a bit less vanilla next time for me. Will definitely recommend for a friend coming, because of the environment but I had a hard time ordering from their menu because there was nothing that I would have really ordered from it. I would probably come back for their coffee bar, and do some web surfing in here. There's definitely a lot of customers that look like they're having business meetings here as well.",

I was initially really impressed because the hostess asked if we had any seating requests and I asked for a booth, she didn't have an issue with it at all. The ONLY reason I gave them 3 stars is because of a previous visit where the food and service were great.

    "text": "It was hard to drive from Avondale to this place but after seeing the awesome looking food via Instagram we decided to make the trip.  It was a pretty busy place. We decided to sit at the bar. Was given water right away and menus. Everything sounded delicious. I ordered coffee and the caramel apple french toast and my friend ordered the California scramble. Food took its time coming out. The coffee was good on its own without creamer which was nice. The french toast outside was hard while the middle where the caramel sauce was very soggy. The apples were good but I couldn't get over the toast being either soggy or hard. I didn't try the scramble but my friend said it was just ok. I was told this place was more known for the drinks but being pregnant I was unable to try them. Not sure if we'll be back or at least make the trip again unless we are doing something else.",

It was all I was it was hyped up to be. Beautiful atmosphere. Comfortable and a lot to look at. First night, we enjoyed dinner, the food was spectacular, service was spot on and the drinks were divine. Try the truffle fries and Brussels Caesar salad... , Lunch next day... couldn't get enough. Heirloom carrot salad and a Wildflower specialty coffee drink... last day... sad day... Breakfast. Again the wildflower. chai, espresso and vanilla. and a scrumptious almond pastry. My kiddo is gluten free and pick her up the best tasting raspberry chocolate gluten free muffin. As we were about to depart, we were told they were planning a build of a new restaurant in Coronado. put me on your list, i will be there.",

Not sure if Fox concepts are having some issues but each of the concepts that I have gone to in the last 5 to 7 months have had multiple issues with their service food and just a general lack of caring at the facility. Managers usually take care of it but I'd rather have it correct and not have to send back food multiple times because it's cold or the wrong food or not cooked correctly. I hope it's just a string of unlucky circumstances and it will improve. Last night came in we shared a salad and The Bolognese. The salad was good The Bolognese came out cold and the pasta was undercooked and hard. We were also one of three tables in the entire restaurant so they were not busy. I hope you guys get your stuff together because I enjoy almost all of your Concepts but losing a little faith and them at this point.",

And it passed. I noticed the care this place puts on their patrons, and I can always appreciate that. We started with the beef potstickers, and shared the Butter Crab and fries. We needed comfort food & we can say, The Henry delivered. I tend to be very picky with the temperature of the food. What is the purpose of cold French fries, or melted ice cream? When you think about it, it really is a big deal, right? But thru this specific need I realized the care, & superior service you will expect from the serving staff and management at The Henry. Brad is on point. He took the time to stop by, said hello, and made the mood really light. I love it when I choose a place, and not only the food is great but my friends come out saying they had a great time! Brad was part of that. So I commend this restaurant for having such quality people. That includes our waiter, the bartender and everyone who tended our table. Thank you. Sometimes the food is not all. This is this is truly a place when in the mood for something special. P.s Special shout out for the croissant dessert. Best dessert in a while. Warm and delicious. Totally recommended!",

That's one of things I luv about The Henry, the menu is seasonal. Last time or two ago we were there, we had the Short Rib Potstickers (maybe a tad too rich), the Caesar (I ask for no or very easy dressing).  Entree? I had the Seared Ahi Tuna, I always ask for sauce on the side, plate cold and no finishing salt, but I'm funny about those things. it's delish. Hubby had Roasted Chicken, he loved it, as usual.  Great service, we don't get dessert. We'll be back.",

Despite it being a busy day, I thought they did a good job with bringing out our food because I didn't feel like we were waiting too long. We were given an additional order of truffle fries because they thought we were waiting too long even though we didn't notice lol, it was a nice gesture. I must say, if there was one thing I could change about my experience, it would be the food I chose to get which was the Turkey Omelet..I personally didn't like it and thought it was bland.

Well unfortunately this was incorrect. We only came because of this promise.  Our server did offer some simple breakfast options but unfortunately none were what we wanted. We all ordered lunch. The food was good; we all ordered something different: pastrami sandwich, Asian chicken sandwich, Cobb salad, pasta with bolganse sauce and a hamburger. One of the orders was incorrect and I do appreciate how quickly it was addressed; even the manager apologized. They covered the order that was wrong. I really appreciate restaurants that care for their customers and The Henry did just this.   I liked my latte and the coffee is delicious. I do feel our server was good and it wasn't her fault that the person taking our reservation gave us wrong information.   If we come back we will come earlier to have breakfast/brunch.",

Each time we did have someone else check on us and take our drink order before the actual sever approached our table. I found that a little odd and off putting but at least someone else did check on us after being seated and waiting for a while. Other than this, the rest of the dining experience was great both times.   The Henry is one of many Fox Restaurant Concepts and the building it sits in seems to house headquarters (upstairs) as well as a coffee shop and seating area (main floor). If you do wander upstairs you'll see a meeting room with office space, along with an outstanding view of Camelback Mountain. You'll also see plaques of all the Fox Restaurant Concepts. I didn't realize how many they own!   Back to The Henry. Outstanding food. Fresh and cooked to perfection. Really enjoyed the burger and it's nice you get a choice or fries or a substantial side of their kale salad. Nice list of wines, cocktails and mocktails. Love their patio seating, which offers lots of shade and misters during summer months and warming lamps in winter months.   Do expect a wait for brunch on the weekends and during holidays.   Definitely a cool place to take out of towners because of the ambience and great food!",

My most recent visit was vastly different.. My sister and I took my mother for her birthday to brunch and we walked away disappointed by the experience. I've never been \"wow'd\" by Fox restaurant's food but the great decor is unique and the outdoor seating at The Henry seemed perfect for a daytime celebratory meal. Unfortunately the service was just lacking in so many areas: after an hour in, we had only been seated and refreshments delivered. My father had to leave for an appointment with his waffles in a to-go box. I'm sure it tasted lovely later post-microwave. Then my mother's salad was just plain sad..it had the most meager sprinkle of shredded chicken I've ever seen. This all being served by a young lady with zero personality and she really appeared to hate her job. This place is definitely worth a visit for drinks and to take in the spare-no-expense decor but temper your expectations a bit on everything else.",

But this time around it just wasnt good. It was nowhere as good as the first time. It was just ok. Not so happy with the lack of consistency. Quite disappointing in fact. But maybe it was just a bad day for the chef. Ok that is fine. But when I mentioned this to our waitress,  her attitude changed. The steak was not her fault,  she had nothing to do with it. But after that she started being short with us and just dropped the check on our table. That is not very professional.  For any restaurant,  the wait staff should be able to take any criticism,  as long as it is doled out nicely. If I never intended to come back here,  I would not bother to express my opinion on the steak. But I did so because I want to come back and have the steak that I had the first time I was here. Not to take away the credit for the truffle fries. They were fantastic by the way.",

Sat at one of the comfy seating arrangements in the bar area. Big mistake. As the restaurant fills up, people waiting for tables start to crowd into this area as the hostess stand is located nearby. It started to  1) get claustrophobic and 2) we completely lost sight of our waitress so ordering more drinks, obtaining water, and getting our check all proved difficult.   We ordered drinks and appetizers at the same time. Another mistake. Appetizers all came out 10 minutes before the drinks arrived. I can understand drinks before food but the reverse is just awkward.   My suggestion would be to wait a few weeks and given them some time to work out the kinks. With their corporate offices upstairs, I would assume they can work out glitches soon.",

However, for such a lovely restaurant the service was below par. I'll leave names out, but I had to ask for my water 3 times. I also had to remind him several times for a glass of wine that I ordered. He was very slow and he would come up to the table to ask if would need anything completely spacing anything we were already waiting on. We voiced to him and he said he had a huge party in the back. So apparently they were getting the good service. He should have relinquished us to another server. We did eventually (and kindly) mention our service to the manager. In response we got a \"thank you for letting me know\". You can draw up your own opinion here, I'll just say first impressions are everlasting. Only other thought is that the menu wasn't too extensive. Not much to choose from. Again, I did however enjoy my meal and the restaurant itself. Better service and we're in business.",

We were initially concerned after looking at the menu that there weren't enough choices. But we were wrong. The food was flavorful, and I loved the dish I ordered. The atmosphere is perfect for a Saturday night out, it was lively, comfortable and almost felt like a modern speak-easy. I felt like I was at a bar restaurant back East. I personally loved the coffee bar too.  I think our good experience was also attributed to our waiter Luis. He was patient with all of our questions, answered every question carefully, made sure we were happy with our meals, made suggestions based on our needs, and then allowed us to sit and talk after our meal without rushing us out. This is a rare experience in the restaurant industry.   Amazing food, first-rate service, another win for Fox Restaurants.",

The manager came and brought us some appetizers. That was nice but would have liked them 30 minutes ago not right before our food. They brought out food at 1:31. Overall it's kind of overrated. There are other really good places to eat on a Sunday afternoon.",

    "text": "We planned my sister's 30th birthday at The Henry.  I went to make the reservation for Sunday evening at 7pm for 15 people.  They said that the max reservation size was 12.     Okay, we made it for 12.  Then they asked us to change the time to 530pm or 830pm and that they preferred not to seat a large party during peak dinner hour.  When we said no and we would make the reservation elsewhere, they said okay.  They also said that preferred if we didn't bring balloons or a cake.  They said this with a bit of a snooty attitude.  We were a little caught off guard with all this.  I guess we thought they would welcome a large party, not make things difficult.  We thought about cancelling out of principal, but decided to keep the reservation.  We arrived a few minutes early and it took about 20 minutes to be seated.  Once we were seated, we ordered drinks which were great, but too a long time.  No bid deal.  We ordered dinner and it actually came out pretty quickly.  Overall, the food was very good.  I think our table ordered every entree on the menu.  Both pasta dishes were very good.  The chicken was also good, but mine was luke warm when it arrived.  It tasted great and the sides were also very good.  The fish also got very good reviews.  The only thing that was not well received was the short rib.  The taste was good, but it was really fatty and not much meat.  We didn't order dessert.  The staff and servers were great.  Overall, I would likely go back, but I wish our first experience with the staff making the reservation was more positive.  If so, I would have probably given this review 4 stars.",

If you have a Porsche and worried about a good parking space, forget it.  you are going to get dinged in this crazy parking lot.  I saw several women with huge Suburbans trying to squeeze those into tiny spaces then slamming the doors into adjacent cars trying to get out.  Anyhow, very stuffy and entitled, spoiled hostesses like you are bothering them to put your name in.  Then they want to 'text' you for your reservation.  Well, i gave a number went outside, 45 minutes later no text.  I dedided to just leave rather that go into those snots and asked what was going on.  so, i didn't get to try the food because I couldn't get past all of these challenges.",

The ambiance is very trendy and it has a very fun vibe.  Make sure you have reservations though otherwise you will not get a table. Now for the food...everything I tried was delicious!  The chicken gyro is very tasty and their half baked chicken leaves you wanting more.  The mac n cheese is a great side dish too!  I had the bread pudding for dessert and it was enough for 4 people.   I will definitely be returning!",

Not my home, but maybe a rich friend's parents' home.  So much so that I felt appreciative that they offered to let me eat with them.  Stupid I know, but it's the truth.  That being said, I LOVE a place that feels fancy, where I wonder if they are okay with me bringing my toddler, then they bust out the high chair and kid's menu.  I'll no doubt be coming back here, often.  Definitely note that you'll want a reservation (at least for dinner on weekends from my experience).  We eat dinner early, like 'old people' early, but getting there at 5:00 was not early enough to get us a table on a Saturday.  The next weekend I called on Thursday only to find Saturday was already fully booked, so we reserved for Sunday.  Point of story, call ahead.",

From the bench seating along the wall, covered in a rich olive green, you have a full view of the open kitchen. The aromas are amazing and people are chatting away amping the noise level and the vibe.  The wine list is good- there are enough choices in all price categories for everyone to imbibe. So I already mentioned the aroma- but electronic words on a website do not do it justice- it is amazing. I ordered the pasta bolognaise; the thick sauce was served over very large, fat, thick elbow shaped noodles that were cooked to al debts perfection. My sister had the roasted chicken which I also got to taste and it was delicious. The dessert menu did not disappoint; in addition to traditional dessert, there were many dessert wine and after dinner drink options available...very, very nice! Prices were reasonable for the atmosphere and quality of the food. Definitely on my list to come back to on my next vacation.",

We also ordered the IPA ($4 HH), and 3 happy hour food items: all American burger, truffle Parmesan fries, and the truffle kale dip. Honestly, everything was amazing. The happy hour prices almost cut the bill in half, and the server was super attentive. The whole experience was awesome. I can't wait to come back for dinner!!!",

They have some great options too. We started off with guacamole and I have to say that was the only thing I wasn't wild about. It just tastes like avocado mashed with some seeds on top, sorta flavorless. But my meal was so delicious it made up for it! I got the harvest bowl! Lots of delicious veggies with a delicious sauce and quinoa. I'm going to try to recreate it at home because I could eat that every day! The veggies on there are cooked perfectly. Stole some of my boyfriends fries too and they were good. Everyone else I was dining with enjoyed their food too, glad I came here finally!",

Overall good service though from a very young person.  FOOD:  Excellent, the kitchen was on point with my fish which was perfectly cooked both hot, moist and just amazing. The cauliflower risotto also very good.   I was not overly impressed with the potstickers, our specimens came out a bit mushed up and the short rib filling was ok, good, but not really super memorable but people on the boards seem to love them. Personally I would look elsewhere on a table starter.    Would I love to come back, ABSOLUTELY.",

I think the one thing that was concerning was the number of fruit flies here. One actually drowned in my drink after crawling on some leftover pastries. But that doesn't seem like something the restaurants can control. Fruit flies are so hard to get rid of! Parking is tough especially on the weekend. We managed to get a parking spot luckily because we arrived right as someone had pulled out, but on our way out got honked at because someone wanted to take our parking spot and we were taking the time to put on our seatbelts (quite rude). The whole vibe inside the restaurant is very pleasant and the staff are so friendly!",

There were so many business people having work meetings or conference calls in the other booths! It had more of a work place ambience than casual breakfast spot. On the other side of the Henry, you can find rows of work tables with many outlets. This is definitely the quieter side with many people doing solo work on their laptops. The outdoor patio is really nice as well with the cutest decorations and fireplace! There's also a great view of camelback!! Around 11am the pace started picking up as more people started to come for lunch, which was okay because I just moved over to the quieter side!   The Henry has beautiful decorations with many photoworthy spots!   Parking: We found free parking but noticed that they also do valet parking.",

So, what better time to visit than for an anniversary with me & mine?   We were able to set a reservation, and were promptly sat when we arrived. The entire evening the staff was extremely professional and welcoming. This has to be one of the best dining experiences I have encountered- dishes were removed immediate after finishing, water was constantly refilled, we were checked on multiple times, etc. Special shoutout to Mike Bos who went above and beyond to ensure we had a a great anniversary date!  On top of the 5 star service was the 5 star food! We ordered the short rib potstickers- flavorful and delish! The sauce it sits in is amazing, as is the seer on the bottom. For entrees we ordered the chicken with a side (mac & cheese) plus an extra (who can resist brussel sprouts?!). Once again, no complaints.   Once of the most well-rounded and fantastic meals I have experienced to date.",

    "text": "What a cool concept! Sometimes when a restaurant tries to do too much, it ends up doing everything in a mediocre way and nothing really well. The Henry does quite the opposite.   It manages to succeed as a hangout, a coffee shop and a solid American style casual restaurant with great indoor and outdoor seating options with a cool vibe to boot! Phew... that was a mouthful but basically sums up the genius of The Henry!   We had plans to go to FnB but one of the hotel employees recommended this place and the online menu looked like it would hit the spot. So I made a last minute res on a Tuesday night. Imagine my shock when we arrived at 6:15 and the place was beyond packed! Young professionals buzzing about at the bar, families and vacationers dining at tables, lots of people waiting to be seated.   Our server was young and didn't quite get it right when we asked for a recommendation for a locally brewed IPA and he delivered a great choice from Oregon! No harm no foul because the beer was to our liking anyway. I enjoyed a really fresh cocktail prior to my meal.   We ordered the Green garden kale salad which was split into two plates for us to share. My husband ordered the Parmesan truffle fries, and Mushroom paella. I had the grilled salmon with Marcona almond pesto served over barley.   I generally find salmon quite pedestrian but the preparation here was really good. The salad was also terrific and the fries well seasoned and tasty, if not original. My husbands mushroom kale paella with an egg was quite yummy but the skillet was mainly rice. Yes, paella is a lot of rice but the proportion of mushroom and kale to rice just seemed imbalanced. But overall the food was just yummy!   If only we had a place like this in NJ....I would be a regular. The Henry isn't fancy but it sure hits the spot whether you're looking for a cocktail, a light bite or a full meal... all in a trendy atmosphere with shabby chic furnishings and great people watching.",

The ahi tuna dish with green curry rice, shiitake mushroom, snap pea, heirloom carrot, thai basil and lemongrass broth was a wonderful blend of flavors  and high quality ingredients. I'll definitely return for this same dish and the p'nut butter molten cake and another refreshing cocktail. The atmosphere is fun and unique. I especially liked seeing the chefs create the dishes and being served by Alex, who was one of the very best servers with a great sense of humor.",

I ordered The Chloe for my morning coffee and I was NOT disappointed. It was sooo good. If I lived in Phoenix I think I would drive here solely for that drink alone.   The ambiance was nice. We ended up in a room filled with causal seating and tables - many people working on their laptops. It was packed with a lot of people but the service was quick and friendly.",

We order the ginger beer and mix berry both non alcoholic.  Very tasty. The ginger wasn't very strong and the mix berry had berries in the drink. We order a few things on the happy hour menu. Both of us are working on being vegetarians and was glad that there was plenty to chose from on the menu. The truffle fries, not too salty with large portions that neither of us were able to finish. The guacamole was fresh with large avocado pieces and not spicy. The kale truffle dip was also very tasty with small kale pieces inside. The whipped cauliflower dip was also very tasty but has a hint of bitter after taste. The texture was similar to whipped cream cheese.  I ordered an entree which was the tacos. The onion in the taco was well seasoned however the quinoa was not. I didn't try the beans because I was so full from all the previous dishes.  Our waiter Alex W, was very attentive and always came at the right time to serve our food and drinks. Definitely would ask for him again when I go back because of his wonderful service.  As for dessert, they accidentally brought us the pear basque cake and it was a treat. The pear sorbet went perfectly well with the cake. Fresh pear on top. We order the dulce de leche and it had passion fruit juice ozzing from the mousse, reminds me of sunny side up egg. The sweetness of the mousse went well with the sour taste of the passionfruit juice. The presentation was also very appetizing. Thank you for a free dessert!  Price with taxes was $63, totally worth it.  4 appetizers 1 entree 2 desserts 2 non alcoholic drinks",

Convenience to the airport is a major plus, and I can see why a lot of business diners go here.   It was hard to decide on beer v wine v cocktails here. All of the choices looked amazing. I would definitely come back again - for drinks and/or dinner. We ended up sticking around for most of the night.  Only downside was the service. Our server was pretty bad - he forgot about my wine order several times and took forever to get us our drinks and take our food order. He forgot about a lot of the things we asked for and seemed very distracted and scatterbrained. Our experience improved greatly once the crowds dwindled and our server was replaced with someone who seemed more senior.",

I would absolutely recommend the grilled & chilled shrimp and the roasted chicken. The service was professional and very fast, even with the high volume in the restaurant.  The layout is a little interesting with the more casual, low tables, paired with the larger chairs, in the front of the restaurant. (Not my favorite) I was happy we got sat at a cozy booth in the back.  The hostess stand is easily missed if you have never been and the host does not wear a uniform. We stood for a few minutes, confused on who was supposed to greet us. Other than the short wait in the beginning, the experience at The Henry was great!",

    "text": "The ultimate \"meh.\"    You walk into this place and you're struck by the decor.  It's a good looking place.  Good looking furniture, good looking people, good looking design.  Then you notice there's no hostess stand and what appears to be a refugee camp of people crowded to your left.  If you push through that, you'll find a hostess with an iPad that will tell you it'll be 90-120 minutes.  What she won't tell you (or me at least) is that the tables by the door you walked in are first-come first-served.    The bar area is tiny for a place like this.  It seats maybe 15 and you'll have people hanging over your shoulders the whole time trying to get $7 beers while they wait in the refugee camp I spoke about earlier.    Once seated you get the priviledge of waiting 15-20 minutes to meet your waiter, who in my case was a very friendly gentlemen.  I think he was the highlight of the evening.   As has been said in many of these reviews, the menu is very narrow.  We had an app, 2 entrees, a salad, and dessert.  The entrees were good.  The gemelli with housemade bacon was very tasty and the cod was good.  Not $26 good but good.  The salad was literally a few leaves of iceberg and a cherry tomato.  We sent our app back (because it was cold) and then received it cold again.  Really?  Dessert (salted peanut butter bar) was difficult to chew and not really good.  All in with tip for two people we spent $100.    I like Culinary Dropout, Sauce, and Blanco and I'd heard good things about this place.  What I experienced was that this place is new & feels cool, so you want to believe it was great.  But if you look past the plastic surgery (of the restaurant and the audience) you'll find you could have done better for your money nearly anywhere else.",

My boyfriend ordered their brisket, which was actually really tasty, but too fatty for his preferences.  My other friend ordered their vegetarian pasta, but the entree was too small for him.

Large, comfy armchairs and banquettes share space with communal tables and more intimate lounge spaces. The menu is tight but inviting - lots of great coffees, teas, and drinks on the menu featuring food with a focus on breakfast classics with a SW spin.   I asked about the Quinoa Breakfast Burrito and was informed that it was a \"staff favorite,\" which is usually a good sign. In this case, that was True. Large enough to be filling but not so large that a food coma ensued, the results were very tasty. Coffee was on point, and the hot tea selections look good.   I also found service to be friendly. The XV side is counter service and my cashier was lovely and patient, and food arrived quickly. Once seated, I never felt hurried to give up the chair. It made be feel comfortable and welcomed, as if sitting in someone's home.",

    "text": "I was extremely impressed with this place. I met a friend here for brunch and I was very surprised with how great this restaurant looked inside as well as how delicious the food was. This was my first trip here and it took me a few minutes to figure out how we were to be seated. I was expecting a host/hostess to seat us but when I looked around I didn't see anyone. There was a counter off to the side where everyone orders from. After your order and pay, you take your number and seat yourself.   I ordered a quinoa breakfast burrito which had organic eggs, quinoa, black beans, roasted corn, pasilla chile, avocado and pepperjack cheese wrapped into a tortilla.   It was so yummy. I ordered an iced coffee that was good. My daughter had a blueberry muffin, a side of scrambled eggs and freshly squeezed orange juice.   This is a great place for meeting clients, friends and even to just work alone. They have a room off to the side with large tables where everyone seemed to be working in their laptops. Very cool!! I will be returning!!",

    "text": "Okay, this is a great new place.  Has the Hillstone vibe.  Beautiful furnishings, incredible staff.  Really, I mean incredible.  Our waitress was phenomenal, and one of the guys (A.J.) was extremely friendly, and knowledgeable.  There was also a guy named Doug that was very friendly and stopped by to say hi.  The pros:  1.  Really nice ambiance (great place to take your clients)  2.  Great staff (knowledgeable, energetic, and very friendly)  3.  Really good food   4.  Fair and honest drinks ( a tad pricy mind you, but that is par for the course at a nice restaurant).  The one thing you CANNOT GO WRONG ON is the artichoke appetizer.  I am not lying when I say that is the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD, and I doubt anyone can top it.  It comes with an amazing cream sauce, and will BLOW YOUR MIND!!!  The cons  1.  Parking isn't the best, but okay.  2.  Main courses (limited selections (which I often think is a good thing, but compared to Hillstone - my caddilac of restaurants, it doesn't compare.  3.  I would not waste $28 bucks on the short ribs (which is what I ordered) - you get like two ribs and one was basically all fat - horrible value for the money).    4.  I can'e be much more positive over what my wife ordered (the Chevy Chase steak sandwich), which was just okay and not worth advocating for (I n fact, I wish I could have charged it to the Underhills bill if you know what I mean)!! Maybe that's how they named it?   Hahahaha  5.  Sam Fox, the owner, was present, but he did not come by to say hi.  If it were me, I would take an hour and make the rounds.    All in all, it is a good place, I will go back to sit at the bar, sip a nice wine, beer or cocktail, and order the artichoke appetizer.  To me, that's where it's at.  I will still take my best guests and business clients to Hillstone.  Have fun, and find your sizzle!

Pups aren't allowed on the dining patio, only in the very front, which they don't normally make a reservation for (because it's first come-first served for quick coffee and pastries). But they made an accommodation for us. Had a nice shady table in the front where we could catch views of Camelback Mountain and people watch.  This place is turning into an Arcadia hotspot and we saw lots of folks, mostly well-heeled, coming and going with their families. But it's also a good place to enjoy coffee or made-to-order Bloody Mary's with friends. Like all Fox Restaurants, the interior is well designed and the menu is innovative, but I kind of wished they had more traditional breakfast staples. For example, they offer carrot cake pancakes and caramel apple french toast...which sound decadent...but too dessert-like for me for breakfast.   I had the Flower Child Scramble with organic eggs, kale, mushrooms, asparagus, peas and parmesan accompanied by potatoes. It was good, but didn't come with toast, so I ordered a side of the Cheddar Popovers to nosh on while waiting for the main entree. Hubby had the Quinoa Breakfast Burrito, which he enjoyed. I also ordered the \"Drop Out\" latte with caramel and it was delish.   The bill for two was around $50, so not a cheap place for breakfast, but good for special occasions.",

Really fun to watch beautiful, fancy-looking people come in and out of the place. I called ahead about happy hour and was told 4-6:30 $5 wells and $2 off cocktails, wine and beer. Turns out it was just 4-6pm and $2 off draft beers and wine. But the wine list doesn't show which are on tap so good luck with that.  My waitress also tried to convince me we that ordered a round of drinks after the 6pm cutoff. She gave some attitude and made it seem like a big deal having the manager make the price change.  Unfortunately for her, I had closed another bill at the bar just after we had ordered said round of drinks and the time stamp was 5:52pm. I circled that time on the receipt and left it with my tip.   I was really liking this place and she kind of ruined the mood for me. I told her I wasn't trying to be cheap ($2, no big deal) but I like to receive the correct price for something I order and not be lied to about it.  I've yet to try the food but will update this review once I make a return visit.",

The best haricot vert (green beans) you'll ever have.  Nevermind the secret ingredient is butter.  It's amazing. You'll eat all your veggies here without a complaint.  Did I mention that the cheddar popovers come with ham butter?   It tastes like ham, melted into butter.  Really, it does. How does that even happen?   I had a prime rib special. Not on the menu, and you are missing out.  The portion of meat was huge (14 oz, I think!) and it was cooked to perfection, served with aux jus. It was some of the best meat I think I've ever had at a restaurant.   My boyfriend had the short rib, which either tied for deliciousness or came in a close, close, close second by a hair.   The prices are reasonable for the fantastic quality of food (plates $18 - 25 for the most part) and entrees include sides.  There is a good selection of interesting cocktails to choose from. I tried their version of the Moscow Mule with a twist.  It was great!  Drinks are a little pricey so check the drink lists before you order.  Waiters tried to upsell us on a bottle of wine that was $180.  Luckily, we checked the menu first!   The ambiance is nice - it's spacious, light and open yet the volume is comfortable and setting intimate for a nice date night out on the town.  There is a huge patio, which I'll be excited to check out soon. I love the casual furniture that makes it feel warm, welcoming & casual if you are just going for drinks and to lounge with friends for happy hour.   I can't wait to go back and explore the menu, so happy that this restaurant is in my Arcadia neighborhood.   Hold onto your hat Chelsea's Kitchen and LGO - the Henry is in town!!  This is the first Fox Concepts restaurant that I have given 5 stars to and will wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who asks.  Go forth and enjoy!!!",

The staff more than made up for it and were very apologetic about the late delivery of the food.  Again, the service was exceptional.  The only thing I would need to point out is that we never did get our boxed food that was left over from the meal.  It's not a big deal, but noticeable.    The food was very good.  I got the roasted chicken which was just up my alley considering I have the blandest palate.  My girlfriend got the pork and she really enjoyed it.

What I love about this place: When I walk in everyone is dressed up either like they spend their Sunday sitting in lounges like Mad Men or they just left church. Either way, I'm digging it. The decor is wonderful, it's a Mad Men era-esque style with a modern vibe.    Call ahead, seems like breakfast on the weekends gets busy and you need a reso.  They have a juice and coffee bar with danish and other delights available for eating in their sofa / lounge / community table area if you don't want to wait. Full menu isn't avail there though.  Service was a little slow but it was 10 AM on Sunday, and who's in a rush anyway?  My friend had the moscow mule (it comes in the correct copper mug), it looked awesome. I wasn't drinking, only having coffee, but their bloody mary cart looked cool and had infused tito's vodka selections.  I ordered the egg white turkey swiss omelet but with the whole egg, not just the white part. LOL. Also I had the fresh grapefruit juice and aforementioned coffee + cream. Very delicious. Breakfast potatoes came on the side.   Not a huge menu but definitely something for everyone. Looks like they have good sammies and salads too.   Will most definitely be back. :D",

Service is very good and quite professional. Main vegan (squash) entree was a bit sweet for my taste - was it supposed to be accompanied by a side salad? Salmon salad does contain fun surprising flavors.   Wine list is not for the budget minded and is committed to a low price point of $59 bottle.  Also, a happy hour was not noted. Hmm, how about a little give back for future loyal customers?  Quite glad that we ate outdoors as interior is way LOUD, as reputed.  Crowd appears to be from local zip code. The patrons are fully aware that partying here is hip and reduces the drive home plus use of a dishwasher. Clearly, good marketing by Fox.  Indeed, the patio is well laid out and invites folks to relax and spend hours here in the comfortable benches and fun outdoor textures. Unique patio trees. Please relocate gas heaters from touching overhead outdoor lighting. Perhaps the only design flaw?",

My friend had the carrot cake pancakes with a cream cheese icing... they sounded like they would be interesting but they were just plain gross. I had something more normal, the egg white turkey omelette, this was much better than the carrot cake pancakes but very plain tasting. We ordered a bruleed pink grapefruit ( this was better than both our entrees! yummy). We also liked the Bloody Marys, they were good. The atmosphere didn't seem that special, almost like someone's living room. It wasn't bad but I was not excited by The Henry either.",

    "text": "The restaurant has a large sign at the center top of the building, making the restaurant easy to find.  Because the door handles are in the shape of a round sign, we found the door difficult to locate.  Once we figured it out we were inside.  The inside of the restaurant is well lit and attractively decorated.  The restaurant was loud, but we could hear music playing in the background.  The temperature was comfortable.  DINING ROOM The spacing between the tables was tight, but provided adequate space.  Our table had one chair and the other seat was a bench attached to the wall.  Both seats were comfortable and looked new.  The menus were clean and in good repair with no typographical errors.  The napkins, plates, glasses and silverware were all clean and appeared to be nearly new.  Short Rib Pot Stickers The pot stickers were served hot, attractively garnished with sesame seeds, mizuna and a yuzu ponzu sauce.  The portion size was large and enough for two to four guests.  The ingredients tasted fresh and delicious.  This appetizer exceeded our expectations and will be one reason we will return to the restaurant.  Roasted Turkey French Dip The turkey French dip sandwich was served hot with a delicious horseradish aioli sauce.  It was attractively arranged with a simple, but tasty salad.  The serving size was large and enough for one to two guests.  The natural au jus was enjoyable and complemented the turkey and havarti on the parmesan roll.  The sandwich exceeded our expectations.  Wood Grilled Burger The wood grilled hamburger was cooked to a proper medium rare and delicious.  I was an appropriate size for one person.  The French fries were also enjoyable, but many of them were overcooked and burned.  I set them aside as I ate and was surprised that about one-third of them had been ruined.  While the hamburger was made from quality ingredients, I thought that it was slightly overprice at $13 and did not represent a good value.  Chocolate Ice Cream The chocolate ice cream was a medium sized serving of rich, creamy ice cream and was a good size for one person.  It was served cold and had not melted in the dish.  The ingredients were of high quality and refreshing to consume on a hot day.  At only $3, we felt the ice cream was a good value for the price charged.",

The atmosphere lends itself to being a great place to grab a coffee and treat in the cafe, have a business lunch meeting in the restaurant, or meet friends for brunch on the patio on the weekend.  Their brunch menu is my favorite and the live acoustic music is top-notch.   Tons of wonderful breakfast, lunch and dinner menu options, great indoor and outdoor seating areas, upscale yet not too pricey, and always wonderful service.   Sam Fox has done it again!

To start we had the shrimp cocktail which was absolutely disgusting in all honesty. Something just tasted...off.I ordered the brussel sprouts Caesar salad topped with scallops. This was the worst salad I have ever had. It came with probably 3 whole brussel sprouts and the rest was wilted romaine. It was dry as if they didn't put enough dressing on. The scallops were also dry and VERY rubbery. I was hungry so I ate them though... big mistake. My dad and mom did not enjoy their bolognese either. They both reported that the garlic bread was extremely burnt and my dad said the dish lacked the truffle flavor. We were brought out a complimentary peanut butter chocolate molten lava cake which was nice. The cake was cold though and did not taste very good. It was probably the highlight of the meal though. Soon after leaving the restaurant I started to feel queasy in my stomach and extremely nauseous. I ended up taking a melatonin and going to bed in hopes of waking up feeling better. I woke up this morning still feeling ill and sick to my stomach. I ended up vomiting this morning. My dad vomited as well. My mom did not throw up, but she never took a bite of the shrimp or scallops. I'm thinking food poisoning. I will never be back to this establishment.",

Since day one, it's been nearly impossible to visit without a reservation and that's quite a feat for a restaurant in Arizona!   This concept is fresh and has a very \"farm to table\" feel to it. Of course it also has a very \"Sam Fox\" feel it, but that's why the seats are full! The decor reminds me of Restoration Hardware and the food tastes like it's fresh from the garden.   There are three ways to enjoy The Henry: sit-down dine-in, takeout, coffee bar that allows you to work from your computer while you dine. The foo here is very Sam Fox'esque and you can't go wrong with anything you order. During my visit, I ordered the Warm Salmon salad that came with skuna bay salmon, sweet corn, asparagus, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes & smoked onion vinaigrette. Get it. It was fresh, flavorful and filling. The three f's! I also enjoyed a ginger root drink which was a nice drink to accompany my light meal. I can't wait to visit again soon and try more on their menu.",

Unfortunately the  portion size of the sandwich bun seemed small and the bread roll did not live up to the crusty expectations.

    "text": "We were out taking a two hour power walk along the Pima trail, and on the way home, decided to stop for coffee here.   First mistake: came in a door that was near the coffee bar with a seven person deep line almost pushing out the door. A nice regular informed us that the line normally goes a different direction (which would make way more sense, but we just got in the line that had already formed).   What's up with the specialty coffees having espresso and drip coffee? Drip is cheap, so it is definite a way to stretch that profit margin. More caffeine in that drip to add to the espresso based drink? Interesting.  Second mistake: should have gone home first and put on my country club casual, as my jeans and hiking shoes were totally out of place here.  The long-shot double latte had too much milk taste and not enough espresso flavor, even with the long shots. If I come back, guess I'll have to try one of those specialty coffees with the extra drip coffee in it.  The interior, however, was really pulsating. Lots of people watching possibilities.",

    "text": "We had quite a nice evening there, all things considered.  We booked through Open Table and were seated at a nice booth inside, but then quickly realized Happy Hour is only served in the bar, lounge and outside on the patio. Being a nice night, we asked to be moved outside and I'm sure glad we did. Not only did we get to take advantage of their delicious happy hour and prices, but my son wasn't feeling so well and the outside was much better for our needs. They had heat lamps and the ambiance was really nice and quiet.  The happy hour runs 3-6pm, M-F. They have about 6 cocktails, some beers and some wines in addition to about 8 appetizers and even a burger ranging from $5-$8. We ordered a few appetizers, but would've passed on them both (truffle parm fries were fine, but I'd have preferred them plain + the cheese and cauliflower spread-- not my jam. I love all the components, but it just didn't impress as we'd hoped).  What did impress was my cocktail. I had the fig and ginger mule and it was delish. For $5, it was definitely worth it!  I ordered the quinoa tacos. Beans were delicious and a bit spicy and I loved the pickled onions. The quinoa was a bit bland. The rest of the table ordered the turkey French dip, a quesadilla and the kids got a kiddo mac'n'cheese (good) and plain fries (which were the same fries as our truffle appetizer, but more toned down).  Overall, we were pleased. Nothing blew me away, but that cocktail was enough to bring me back. It's a beautiful place and one that is perfect and definitely affordable for happy hour. If you play your cards right, you can manage two fancy cocktails, a couple burgers and a big order of fries all for less than $40, with tip.",

The waiter was distracted and not very friendly (but not rude).   The biggest reason for the 2 stars is my food. My husband had the chicken and loved it. It was juicy and had great pairings. I had a vegetarian dish that had meat as an option to add. I added chicken and when it arrived it was chunks of freezer aisle chicken. Fake grille marks and all. It was mushy and had the freezer taste, same shape. I know it because my roommate used to buy it as a salad topper for lunches.

I had friends from out of town and I recommended The Henry for its atmosphere, service and food but on September 30 Th, they felt flat.   First let talk about the good points, reservation was well handled, we got a table outside, servers were polite and intentionate. However the restaurant did not do so well. The negative.  For a Saturday night at 8:15 pm, reservation they were missing a few items on the menu, for a Saturday, No short ribs, no tuna, although they had another fish to replace it, but it can't be tuna. No mash potatoes, how can you not have mashed prepared.  We took the asparagus Caesar, thinking wow, it's going to be good and for $12 you would expect more, what a disappointment, we found one asparagus in the whole salad, so why is it called Aspargus ceasar salad.  Then I recommended the chicken as normally it is one of there highlight but this time, five out of 6 got that dish on my recommendation but what did they do this time, normally a tender moist chicken, we all got a dry piece of poultry, so dry that everyone were wondering where the chicken came from.  I have been very disappointed with my food, my guest, ( from out of town)  were not impressed either. So many items missing on the menu I could not believed it.  Would I recommend The Henry, they better get back to their standard because I do not give them long before people starts abandoning them.  Better luck next time and if no improvement it will be my last, sorry there is so many more to try.",

We were met with a smile from our waitress Estefy who was extremely nice from start to finish. She was one of the contributors who made our night so enjoyable. She was pleasant to talk too, very patient & checked on us enough to allow us to enjoy our meal without being overbearing. For starters my fiance had a michelob ultra & I ordered a black iced tea. We then ordered the roasted chicken tortilla soup as well as the white truffle parmesan fries for our appetizer's. My fiance loved his soup & said it was just enough with lots of flavor. For our entrees we chose the Roasted Pork Loin as well as the All American Burger (well done) with a side of fries. The burger was very juicy & savory. I was surprised that the bun was nice & soft, it was delicious to say the least! The pork loin my fiance ordered sat on a bed of spinach & vegetables, which didn't last long since he said it was so good! For desert we enjoyed the chocolate peanut butter molten cake & it did not disappoint. This desert came with a scoop of banana gelato that was to die for!! You have to try it because you will be a fan.  Overall our experience was wonderful to say the least. Thanks to Brad B, Estefy & all The Henry staff for making it such an enjoyable dinner from start to finish!! We greatly appreciate all the hard work to make your customers happy & full!",

The bar area is nice, and does have overflow of couches, modern cushioned chairs, high tops on towards the other part of the establishment (they do have a nice looking patio area but today was not a day for it). We arrived at 5pm without a reservation and there was no bar space available, side areas with the sofas and chairs, or high tops in the other section of the restaurant. The staff was quite helpful and sat us at a table in the bar area, letting us know that there was a reservation for the table in a couple hours. Staff was super welcoming, well groomed, and the dress attire was on point. While it is an upscale type of place, it is neighborhood place with a classy vibe.  Service was great, drink options and happy hour drinks were of a wide variety, and they had some yummy looking morsels on their menu. We just had some Prosecco and enjoyed some conversation. The place is open concept but not too loud. Did not have any food, but have heard is fabulous and I will definitely go back to try. Parking was easy and lot was easy to get in and out of. Bathrooms were clean and well stocked. I will definitely be returning to this groovy, homey upscale neighborhood location.  Enjoy y'all!!",

We were all in as a family with appetizers, drinks and main menu items for brunch. We had the Short Rib Potstickers (real good flavor profile and tender meat), the Warm Kale & Truffle Dip which was \"dyno-mite\" and some Strawberry and Mandarin Mimosa's, (followed by a Mixed Berry Mimosa as I wanted to taste them all. All the apps were on point and our server team was really attentive to our needs.   For the main course, I went with the Chicken Fried Chicken, while the kids did the 'Kids French Toast' & the Kids Cheeseburger, which you can see were not some baby kids size, but the right proportion and the Avocado Toast with a Side of bacon (some good bacon, as we order a few sides)   Everything just taste really good. Highly recommend coming and when possible get a reservation to secure your time as they have seating both inside and outside.",

We came in around 9:30 and they told us the wait was going to be 20 minutes even though we could see empty tables everywhere! So we sat at the bar to get served right away. I quickly understood why our wait was going to be long, because by 10 am there was a line out the door to get into the place!! So make sure to make a reservation or come early!  Our breakfast was just okay. It sounds promising but it just didnt impress me or my husband. Its not that it was terrible but for how incredible it looked, I expected to be more wow'd by the flavor. It took FOREVER for us to get our coffees and chai's that by the time we got it, we were   practically done with our food.",

I'm a huge fan of Fox Restaurants; these people truly know how to do a restaurant well. The Henry is a GREAT concept that belongs in a city like Austin or SF, impeccably decorated and housing an espresso bar, huge cocktail, and special event rooms within the restaurant space. On weekend mornings they also have a bloody mary cart they roll around to tables! A very forward-thinking concept that still manages to feel like your friendly neighborhood spot.  The food and drinks are always very well made, and pricing is exactly what it should be in Arcadia. Typical to Fox concepts, the menu is relatively limited but curated perfectly; you're not likely to find a bad option. However, service here is always only okay at best, usually pretty slow and generally a bit underwhelming. This could be just coincidence, and in any case, I love everything else about it enough to keep coming back!",

There were flies and birds around my food and a lot of annoying people taking pictures with the Henry sign which I agree I am guilty of doing myself but it gets super old once there's huge parties of people.   This is a really stuck up place not really laid back and mellow it's really busy too so keep that in mind. If you want to avoid wanna be Beverly Hills barbies with attitude then don't come here.   Our server was James he did a good job trying to help us out as best as he could.   The food was great super basic it was rich in quality. Not super exhilarated with joy over this place.",

    "text": "A comfortable restaurant with a great atmosphere and good food.   Had dinner recently at The Henry when in town and staying locally.   It's a big restaurant, with a coffee/breakfast bar on the right, a bar in the center and seating to the left, plus a sizable patio outside.   The atmosphere is upscale with a refined yet relaxed decor.  The crowd was definitely of the \"after work before heading home\" variety.   Without a reservation, it took about 15 minutes to get a table. Our server, Patrick, provided attentive service, albeit rushed. Thank you!   We opted for the side order size of brussels sprouts as an appetizer, and the seared Ahi and Korean skirt steak as entrees.   The brussels sprouts were roasted perfectly - not too soft, not too hard.  They could have used a little more seasoning, but were still delicious.   The fish was artfully plated over a bed of green curry rice with mushrooms, snow peas, carrot and garnished with Thai basil; in a earthy lemongrass broth.  The fish was just OK, because it was overcooked to my taste - despite ordering the tuna rare, it was delivered medium well.   The Korean skirt steak was a generous helping of sliced skirt steak, medium rare - as ordered.  The steak is served atop a bed of double egg fried rice, snow peas, bok choy and mushrooms and garnished with mint, cilantro and ginger to give it some kick.  The steak was very flavorful and there was just enough heat to the dish to enhance the flavors.  Sadly, even though the steak was prepared perfectly and very tasty, it was cold.   We topped off the meal with a shared dessert - caramel apple hand pie.  This is an apple filled pastry, served with a scoop of butter pecan ice cream and a dollop of lemon whipped cream and a hint of thyme.   A fantastic combination.    The tab for two was $82 including a shared dessert and soft drinks.  A little more attention to food quality would definitely bump this spot up a notch.   A single meal doesn't define a restaurant, so next time in town, will give another try.",

I arrived pretty early (around 5:45pm) on a Tuesday night and the place was already packed, so clearly I'm not the only one who feels this way. They have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating along with a more casual coffee shop on the right side of the restaurant.   I took advantage of the beautiful weather and sat outside. I started with an order of the roasted brussel sprouts, which were delicious and not too salty as they often are at restaurants. I ordered the harvest bowl ($17) as my main meal, and all of the flavors were perfect! You can get a protein like chicken or shrimp on top, but I chose to just have the veggies. I couldn't resist the bread pudding for dessert, which was the right decision. It comes in it's own dish and was SO GOOD.",

The fried rice had a little spice and had a lot of flavor.   The others in the party had the Norwegian Smoked Salmon - he loved it! And the Chilled Shrimp App - she loved the grilled flavor and sauces it came with. They also started with the House Parker Rolls and raved about them.

Even though I'm on a restricted diet, I tasted their dishes so I could provide an accurate review of the food.  Even better my friends loved it and will share with their friends in New Jersey.

We also shared appetizers of the short rib dumplings (yummy but small!) and the truffle fries. Service was good and they have some cute cocktails.  I liked my salad but felt like I had to hunt for those carrots - if you call it a carrot salad it should have a bit more and there were very few. Beautifully dressed salad and the skirt steak was on point - I would have wished for a bit more portion of meat, but overall it's a fine size for dinner, and it's better to eat more veggies than meat right? ;)  I also had the side of Mac and cheese, it has Havarti, American and parmesan, it was ok, not outstanding but fair if you have a hankering for it. Overall a great place for a night out, ample parking, good food! Would come back again when I'm in PHX (I was visiting from out of town!)  Thanks also for a wonderful bread pudding with a little candle in celebration of my b-day!",

Ordered the quinoa tacos which were delicious and enough for me even though you get only 3 mini soft tacos. The portion here is very off though. Someone ordered the burger which is HUGE and another ordered the Ginger Cod which left him still hungry because he finished it in 4 bites. For dessert, everyone raved and shared the custard over the chocolate cake. Oh, love the patio seating but be prepared to get blinded by headlights if you are facing the parking lot at night, it happened to us every 2 minutes. Only 4 stares because some left starving for the price that was paid and the parking; not only limited but the space is narrow!  I was expecting my car to be key scratched from the driver on my right since he probably had an issue getting in :) Looking forward to trying some lunch items.",

I especially like the Parmesan fries and my husband raved about the flank steak. It is nicely decorated indoors but if the weather is nice we prefer to sit outside on the patio. We usually go on special occasions i.e. birthday, anniversary. A great place to take out of town visitors with amazing view of Camelback Mountain.",

Watch out, though, the bartender pours a super stiff drink! Then we shared an unbelievably good appetizer:  Norwegian smoked salmon on top of tiny potato pancakes with creme fresh.  My husband had caramel apple french toast, and I ordered carrot cake pancakes with creme cheese icing -- which is a shoe-in for the \"Breakfast Dish of the Century Award.\"  The portions are huge. Even the coffee (plain ole black coffee) was exceptional.  The restaurant is beautiful.  The service was great.  They have patio seating -- always a plus.  We will definitely be back!",

They had neither that night so we settled for corn beef sandwich, popover appetizers (Yum!). They even offered free flour-less choc cake since they had just taken off the dessert we came for.  The corn beef was the REAL thing pickled Somewhere in Phoenix (not Boars head) and was delicious. Warning - don't let them put Their dressing on it (mayo on corn beef is Sacrilege), just ask mustard on the side.  The popovers were melt in yr melt with 2 Infused butter choices that came with it.  The flour-less choc cake which I usually find too dense was wonderful!  Not too sweet or dense.  Service was superb. Just make reservations and you won't have a wait.",

After 10 minutes of waiting, I approached the hostess for menus and service. There wasn't anything that stood out on the menu so we only stay for drinks.

    "text": "The Henry seems to be the crown jewel of the FRC (I've heard their kitchen is the test kitchen for upcoming Fox Restaurant Concepts). This can be seen just from its outward appearance with its patio, and the tables lined up outside. Its interior is well made up with its classic contemporary look. There are couches in the lounge areas, and oversized booths with mismatched lamps, and the bar area next to the open kitchen gives this place a look of a True European Brasserie. I went on a recent Saturday evening that was abuzz with people, from the onset with the close to full parking lot, one can see this is the current \"it\" restaurant of Phoenix. It's great for people watching and it attracts a diverse crowd.   I went with some friends, and it seemed difficult to order a drink from the bar since it also served as a dining area that left little room for bystanders peering through the seated persons in attempt to order a cocktail. They have a good selection of wines, limited beer selection, and their cocktails selection is not huge either but I have to say they are all superb. I had the white cranberry punch which was refreshing, a friend had the red stiletto (which to me tasted like cherry Robitussin *shudder*) that she enjoyed, as well as the Prayer Meeting topped with a cabernet float that was exquisite. Other friends ordered the Fig and Ginger Mule served in a copper mug *kudos* and the Pomegranate 75, and heard praises for both.   Dinner was started with two appetizers, the cheddar popovers and the truffle fries. The popovers were good not spectacular but the butters served alongside were the stars of the app, actually the ham butter was the star, and the chive butter was good. I'm tempted to get the ham butter alone because it reminded me of liverwurst pate (the ham flavor was subtle and texture smooth). I ordered the Pork Chop although I was tempted to get the half Roasted Chicken because of the sides but I'm glad I got the Pork Chop because it was delicious. The bone-in was moist with flavor. The Swiss Chard served with the Pork Chop had good flavor and the Cauliflower polenta is something I will order again as a side because it was delicious. I made sure to save some room for dessert because prior to my dining experience at The Henry, I had seen a picture of the dessert menu someone had posted on Yelp, and although The Henry was a resto I wanted to try, my eyes were on the chocolate cake from the very beginning. Yes, I was disappointed it wasn't a slice (I was thinking it would be similar to the chocolate cake at the Parlor, which imho is still one of the best chocolate cakes served in Phoenix) but with the layered vanilla and chocolate ganache, this chocolate cupcake (served in a small jar) was enough sweet for two, it's too sweet because of the ganache but it is good but not something that I dream about unlike the Monkey Bread of Culinary Dropout.   Overall, The Henry is a solid four stars, and I can't wait to go back either for dinner or brunch. .",

The portions are very small and the prices are not.  We had the skunk salmon which was a very small piece and our 16 yr old ate it in less than 3 minutes at a price tag of $28.  We started the evening with the Kale Ricotta dip which everyone thought was way to salty.  We added chicken to the Harvest Bowl which was not oneee the menu being able to add proteins, but the asst manager said most people do, then why not add it to the menu, but chicken was very dry.  I had the homemade pasta with bolognese sauce while the sauce was great the portion size was more of a small lunch size than a dinner size.  We ended the night with everyone having a different dessert.  The pear cake with pear gelato, while the gelato was delicious the cake was hard and dry.  The chocolate molten cake also dry,  the bread pudding was definitely the star.  All in all the dinner was just okay nothing amazing.  Gabriel the waiter was excellent.  The fact portion size was much smaller than normal with the prices more expensive than most, doubt we will return.  No WoW factor here pretty boring and average.",

I came here to work today and loved the relaxed vibe during the afternoon, between 2-5.

There are selective choices on the menu, but I would definitely recommend trying various appetizers vs. one entree to get a better taste of what the restaurant has to offer.   They make sure that your dining experience is pleasant and that your accomodations are met which I really like.",

The food is creative and delicious, the service is just superb, and the facility is a wonderful blend of the casual and the classic. It just feels good to be there in an unhurried, pleasant atmosphere. The wait service team is just superb. They all pay close attention to what's happening at the tables. There was no time when the staff didn't seem focused and hands-on in making sure guests  had what they needed, when they needed it.   The XV Cafe opens early daily for casual breakfast, and it's outstanding. Along with a regular breakfast there this morning, my wife added a chocolate croissant at the end and I had their almond joy/raspberry brownie. Both pastries were impressive to the eye and our tastebuds.   If you haven't been to The Henry, just go and see for yourselves. You may decide to become a regular, too.",

We got checked in & were told the wait would be about 45 minutes to an hour, but in actuality waited about 15-20mins.   Once we we seated our two servers were extremely friendly & helpful-- one girls name was Andy I think, I can't remember the other girls name, but she was a short blonde. Both were familiar with the menu & gave house/personal recommendations.  I ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken with breakfast potatoes & a mimosa. I also had some of my friends Smoked Salmon app-- which was really delicious, but a little over salted.  My entree was pretty good, sunny side eggs were cooked just how I like them & the chicken & biscuit were also enjoyable.  Overall I am giving 4/5 stars, everything was great except for the disorganized feeling at the front. Next time I'll just make reservations!",

For the price, I thought the breakfast was pretty disappointing overall.   I did look at the lunch menu and found that it looked a lot better.

We didn't have a reservation but decided to sit at the bar.   Get the Bloody Mary a la carte! The guy running the cart was so fun and made the experience so fun! I wanted to take him home! They bring the cart up to you and have all the fixings- different flavored vodkas, toppings, spice level. The only thing that would make this better? Blue cheese stuffed olives!   We also got the wildflower coffee- highly recommend if you like vanilla lattes! Quinoa burrito was interesting- quinoa and eggs are mixed together and I would say there's too much egg in the burrito- it needed less egg and more creaminess and unami. Flower child scramble was fresh, light and the vegetables were crisp and delicious! Definitely recommend. Snap peas in it made a big difference.   Staff was very friendly to everyone, not just us! Highly recommend!!! Perfect for anyone staying at the Omni or JW camelback and wanting outside of hotel food great quality yumminess and an atmosphere. I want to stay and eat all my meals here!!",

The decor is nice enough to want to sit & drink for hours, but the food is good enough to want to eat,  too. Nothing on the menu could be classified as 'ordinary'. Go live a little. At least hit the tiny cafe. Get cracking on visiting places like this one. Life is short.",

    "text": "Friend and I went here for dinner this week. We opted to sit outside since it was a nice night. The drink menu was great- great choice of wine and beer and interesting cocktails. As far as food, we ordered the guac to start and did the chicken and bolognese as our mains. I'd skip the guac- too many weird things in it, clementines, pistachios etc. there was more 'stuff' than avocado.  As far as the main courses both dishes were good but the Bolognese stood out! It's a perfect portion with unique noodles- think really big elbow noodles.  You're probably thinking why 3 stars if the food was good. Well, our waiter wasn't great. When we asked for his recommendation on food, it was clear he was trying to upsell us. When my friend ordered the chicken he literally said 'the best thing I like about it is the sides, and you can get chicken anywhere'. He then suggested the steak - which spoiler alert- you can get anywhere. We spent most of the night talking about the service than the food! I'd go here again but I'd hope for a different waiter.",

    "text": "Dang, these other reviews are surprising. I have pretty phenomenally high coffee shop expectations (see: all of my coffee reviews in Austin) but to be honest this is one of my favorite places in Phoenix. Mind you, it's not just for the coffee (the coffee quality is prob a 3 out of 5 star review alone, and the fun coffee drinks/etc are more of a 4 out of 5 for me--could be stronger espresso/overall taste, but totally interesting combinations). But I freaking love working from this space and basically never have a bad experience with that, knock on wood.  I've never had trouble finding parking here, even during the busiest weekend mornings, and there's always a free table or common table chair that is never too far from an outlet, so my needs are met all the way around with that. Wifi is strong, and it's easy to get a coffee and pastry or meal to stay and still see/hear the coffee counter while working from your table. Service has been prompt for me for food, and someone always busses my table before I make it up to the counter to bring my plates or cups back. Pastries are pretty tasty here too!  Overall this is a solid go-to for hanging out with friends or working for a few hours at almost any day/time of the week the place is open. Maybe I have low standards? (Again, Austin kinda killed my expectations of ever being able to find parking and/or a table at any of my first 2-3 tries at a coffee shop on weekends) But definitely give this place a try for yourself!",

    "text": "Fox concepts restaurant. Made a reservation ahead of time for a late brunch. Wait time was about 30 minutes. The look and feel of the place had elements of an office and other unique pieces.   Servers were dressed in a light pink button up shirt, striped ties, vertical striped aprons; and the men seem to be wearing oxfords to complement the look. Spiffy. I asked Seth, our server, to do a run through of the menu of the favorites.   Some of the breakfast/brunch favorites are the quinoa burrito, carrot cake pancake, chicken fried chicken,  smoked Norwegian salmon, roasted turkey french dip and CB and Rye. I opted to go for the Le Pig which had diced potatoes  and scrambled egg, ham and gruyere cheese squished between a pillowed toasted croissant. The chicken fried chicken had biscuit halves with fried breaded chicken on each and 2 sunny side up eggs with gravy sauce surrounding the set. Every bite of each plate was scrumptious.    I'm not a day drinker by any means but I had to try the Henry's Private Island drink made with some acai liquor and some acai juice and other juices. 1/3 of it was just enough for me!   Had to try bread pudding since I'm a huge fan of it! Vanilla bean ice cream scoop sat on top of the bread pudding with large golden raisins sprinkled throughout. Paired with the Cleo which is almond milk, hazelnut and espresso.   Super service from Seth and the staff. Seth was helpful, cheerful and had an amiable personality. I'm planning on coming back here to try the rest of the menu!!",

We come by with our dog about 30 minutes later and informed by the manager (young, good looking hipster dude) that the patio is closed, but 'we'll get you a waiter'.  I told the manager that I was fine to go elsewhere and he said it was no problem.  It was hot and we waited for over 15 minutes and no waiter ever came out.  We finally gave up and went to O.H.S.O. which is very dog friendly.  I get it.... not every place is dog friendly, but why tell us you'll provide service, and then not?",

The brunch menu is not that tasty at all if you're a foodie. If you are hung over and just looking for something quick to eat not going for a quality perhaps this is your place. It's very trendy and has a great appeal but again, the food is way overpriced and not that great. The only reason I continue to go back is because their coffee bar atmosphere is really great for me to study. I ended up studying late last night and ordered some food there and was charged a two dollar up charge for a piece of bread with my already overpriced pasta. $14 for a salad that was the size of a starter plate, not worth it. They have fine dining prices and the quality is just not there! Do not be fooled by the myriad of Teslas, Porches, and S class Mercedes that you see in the parking lot. I think this place gets away with the prices and low-quality food because it's become more of a hook up joint. If you're a cute girl, be prepared to be hit on multiple times while dining or studying! ;)",

I ordered the only vegetarian entree at the time and the cheddar popovers. The ambiance, service, drinks, and food were A-OK that night. Fast-forward to a year and a half later, the place was still completely packed but for breakfast on a Wednesday! Luckily I ordered ahead for pick-up. I could not find any parking, which seems to always be an issue (the reason for the 4 stars). As I drove away, I told myself I would not be back due to the craziness of people in there and the no parking situation. However, as I get back to my office and take one bite of the Quinoa Breakfast Burrito and a sip of my Iced Wildflower coffee, I change my mind immediately. This was the best burrito of my life! It didn't need the salsa that came with it and it was big enough where I only needed to eat half of it to be satisfied. I'll deal with parking any day to have such a tasty breakfast!",

    "text": "Went to the Henry yesterday.  It was a Saturday and they only offered the brunch menu.  Was very excited to go after reading most reviews and knowing fox usually does a nice job at restaurant concepts.  The location and the building its self was exceptional.  Great decor and ambiance.  That is where the compliments must stop.  The food was sub standard and the service marginal.  When we first arrived, we were invisible.  Bartenders, hostesses, and even managers walked right past us, no eye contact or a hello. When we tried to get a glass of wine from the un-busy bar, the bartenders were to engaged in talking to each other and a group of girls.  Once again totally ignored.    Now the food.  I have NO idea how anyone could rate the artichoke appetizer anything other than detestable.  It was a boiled, unseasoned artichoke in a bowl.  Has anyone had the artichoke at Houstons or Hillstones? They are fabulous, tasty, grilled, seasoned.  I was embarrassed how this undercooked, boiled, colorless artichoke was sent from the kitchen.  Next disappointment:  was the battered chicken sandwich, the chinese chicken salad the the french dip sandwich.  All the food was almost cafeteria tasting and looking.  I have had tastier chicken sandwiches at Jack in the Box.  the salad was tasteless and dry.  I asked for more dressing and 10 minutes later she arrived with a thimble full of dressing.  The french dip was the most discouraging.  A un-toasted white dry roll, with slivered beef.  So simple to make the bun tasty by grilling it and adding butter.  Once again, since the Henry is trying to have several menu items like Houstons, they need to get it right because the french dip at Houstons is to die for.  I wanted to like this place SO much and it was all miserable except the pretty couches and great decor.  :(",

First, I have to say the decor is really spot on great...it LOOKS good...and you would expect good food, service and clientele would follow.  The hostess asked if we had reservations...and when I said no...didn't know that we needed them..and she shot me a \"bwah..of course you do stupid\" look. Strike one.  She said we could sit at the bar or wait 2 hours. So we sat at the bar.  The bartender was very nice and sympathized with us not having reservations. Then we ordered. The food was very average...nothing special. Nothing stood out...it reminded me of ordering food at an average high end hotel restaurant. Meh. Strike two.  Finally the one thing was the clientele. When I turned around from the bar to look at who was dining....it was filled with Scottstitutes, cougars, and typical Beemer and Range Rover crowd.  Strike three. There is this magic line that runs down 44th Street that keeps these types away from Acadia and Central Phoenix...unfortunately The Henry sits on the wrong side of this line.  Again..Sam Fox does some wonderful stuff but if you want awesome food I'd opt for somewhere else.",

The decor was inviting and I loved the attached coffee bar, patio seating and the open kitchen. The atmosphere was lively and comfortable. We each had some cocktails, a main dish, and an appetizer. Everything we ate tasted fantastic, and I was happy with the food. However, service was very slow. We had to send back our guacamole because one half of the avocado was not ripe enough and was sitting at the bottom as a solid chunk. They did remake it for us. It took over 30 minutes to get 4 cocktails (highly recommend the fig and ginger mule!) because they missed our drink ticket at the bar. Our waitress did give us free dessert (the bread pudding was amazing!) for the troubles, but it took us 3 hours from the time we sat to the time we paid because of how long we had to wait for the various mistakes to be remedied. At the end, when we got our check, our waitress told us she couldn't split our checks individually and we were already there past closing time, so we just put it on one card so we could just leave already. The food and atmosphere were great, but the service left a lot to be desired. It will be awhile before I return.",

His short-rib was fall-apart delish; my tortellini was excellent, though the sauce was a bit thin. Desserts were good, but not TD4. We arrived at 5 pm on a Saturday, with no reservation, and while the place was definitely busy we didn't have to wait for a table. When we come back (and we will), we'll sit on the patio because the open kitchen & hard surfaces make it really loud inside.

Our waitress, Dana, was helpful and guided us through our first visit (and it won't be the last).  Our Bloody Mary's were good and I had the matzo ball soup with the brussel sprout salad.  Perfect lunch before a movie.  But he best was the Prairie Breeze Popovers.  OMG.  They melted in our mouths.  I didn't partake of the dessert however, my friends had the bread pudding and said it was wonderful.  I held off on my 5th star for when I go to order a full meal.  And kudos to the ample parking lot.  Not usually available in that area.  Thanks again Dana.",

    "text": "We had a large party sitting outside - maybe that was the issue. But the fish was cold, the salad was warm, the minestrone soup was not only cold but mushy and burnt (like it gets when you scrape it up from the bottom of the pot after it's been sitting too long). Three of our party didn't get their food until everyone else was not only completely finished not only with their entrees but also their 2nd cocktails or coffees. Some things were comped but overall mediocre, overpriced (salmon salad, soup and 3 glasses of wine were almost $70 before tip). The wine was passable but nothing special. Nice ambiance but disappointing. Skip it or maybe try it for lunch when they are not busy. And give yourself plenty of time to find a place to park. The place was - unaccountably, based on our experience - busy. Just another trendy Scottsdale watering hole.",

    "text": "our first visit to The Henry (I think it's only about a year old) - another trendy Arcadia spot! great parking to start off (we were just saying parking in Phoenix is part of the dining experience - no?) and as we neared the entrance  we saw lots of comfy seating on the front patio.  we thought the  decor lovely inside in a hip neighborhood way.  our table for four @9:15 on Sat nite just took a minute - enough time to check out the bar and coffee bar/cafe to the right.  however, our table right by the kitchen/dishes was kinda loud - would prefer more in the front next time.  when we ordered a bottle of Riesling for $36, asked for 4 popovers right away.  we hoped she didn't think we meant four orders of popovers - waitress didn't elaborate but she knew we just wanted 4.  they were very good and unique with complex butters but I've had them before served piping hot so I was a little taken aback these were cold popovers.  we couldn't  resist also getting the brie toast (delish brie) so we got the truffled French fries as well - both very tasty to share.  I ordered the salmon salad and again waitress didn't elaborate because there are two - kale with salmon or salmon salad $18.  there was a little mix up but we were compensated nicely without saying a word.  the guys had the black truffle lasagna $16- very tasty with flavorful mushrooms, brussel sprouts with a white cheese sauce.  good service and interesting kinda casual  menu - not somewhere I have to go to all the time but glad we checked it out.   the place was filled with cool people - good choice to bring friends cuz it was a fun nite!",

So we decided to wait and have drinks on the patio. About an hour later my husband went up to check with the hostess to see how much longer we would be waiting because  he saw many empty tables and not many people waiting, he was barked at by the hostess that she told him it would be an hour and 45 min and that's how long we would be waiting. He responded that we were told an hour and half. All the hostesses were very rude and acted like they couldn't be bothered to talk to anybody. I thought that a requirement for hostessing was to be able to smile at a customer. The food was okay but definitely over priced and after our initial treatment we will not be coming back. There are too many restaurant choices in Scottsdale we do not need to pay to be treated rudely.",

    "text": "So, let me say I think this is a great place for drinks with friends.  If you want a superb dinner with excellent food, start at the Henry and move on to one of the terrific restaurants in the Arcadia corridor.  My friend and I ordered the cheddar popovers and were disappointed as there were was hardly a trace of cheddar.  For my entree I had the Mediterranean Branzino.  It was tasty, however I found it a tad too buttery (if that's possible) and thought it a bit rich.  Worth $28?  Nah, don't think so.  For dessert we had a peanut butter banana concoction which was good.  I had a mixed cocktail and it was really great and my friend ordered the Riesling which she loved.   I do love the ambience with the bakery/cafe in the front and the booth we sat at was comfortable and spacious.  Again, wonderful place for a happy hour, or as some other reviewers have had great experiences with brunch, maybe that's an option. I would go back with friends for a few cocktails, but leave the food to another place.",

    "text": "I have wanted to  visit The Henry ever since it opened.  My wife and I are big breakfast fans and travel all over the valley in search of great breakfast places.  The November issue of the Phoenix Magazine featured the breakfast at The Henry in Phoenix, a Sam Fox Restaurant.  What enticed us to go on this Sunday morning was their description of a great French Toast dish with a photograph of a plate of nice thick bread, slices of apple, oozing with a Carmel sauce.  Both my wife and I ordered that dish.  Pictures can be oh so ever deceiving.  (You know FRENCH TOAST is bread drenched in an egg batter, etc. etc.)  Our dish did not resemble the promo photo at all.  We received 4 pieces of sliced white bread, halved and toasted.  To give the toast a well done look they were prepared on a flat grill and pressed down, most likely with a spatula, which burned the exterior of the bread and which was now about 1/4 inch thick.  There was no egg batter, it was TOAST.  There was 7 small slices of apple along with the 8 pieces of toast.  This was accompanied by a thimble full of maple syrup.  THATS IT.  Man oh man!  We were so hungry that we ate the dish, saving one piece each to show the manager that under normal conditions the toast was burned and uneatable.  She told us that she would convey our complaint to the chef.  I would hope so.  If this is indicative of the type of dishes served as a breakfast meal, we will never return.  On the side, I love to cook and know first hand when something is good and when it is bad.  This was a BAD dish.  Further, I have paid much more than the $10 cost of this dish and would never complain about the price, but I could reproduce the same dish for about .15 cents, no more than .20 cents.  I had high hopes for The Henry (The place is neat and comfortable and the service was spot on) but the preparation of our meal has turned us off.",

We waited about 45 minutes for a table on a Sunday around 11:30 so clearly it's already a popular spot. Food came out very slow! Luckily we has a Bloody Mary to start. They came by with a Bloody Mary cart and it was amazing! Try the horseradish vodka in your bloody. To die for! We started with the matzah ball soup which was really flavorful and traditional. Then I had the chopped salad which was horrible.. The bacon was covered In sugar and overwhelmed the entire salad. It was not good. My sister had the smoked salmon appetizer on top of potato Latkes and that was delicious! Other people with us ordered breakfast and loved their food. Since it just opened I'm going to go back and try more things. The place is cute enough that it doesn't matter how great the food is because you want to go back for more!",

The host area is one \"hot mess\" they have no clue what they are doing at all. Its not clear where to go for a reservation or to sit yourself. The hostess was rude in person and on the phone when making the reservation so I'm assuming all of the hostess have attitude. It one instance since it was taking a while I asked the hostess how much longer and she literally and I mean literally snapped at me and told me they were working on it and had to wait, keep in mind it was the first time I asked.  the other star is because of how loud people were being at the bar watching a hockey game. The Henry seems to want to portray that of an upscale restaurant but if you look a little your right you will see tvs at the bar and guys screaming at a game. Are we a high endish/ trendy restaurant or a sports bar please decide and if you guys are sports bar than lower your price and make the menu longer.",

The house salad is also very good and highly recommended as well.  I was looking forward to trying their club sandwich, but all was made up with the turkey dip as a good second.

    "text": "I've been here many times and was shocked to notice I've not reviewed. I've tried so many things on the menus and have never had anything that wasnt terrific. Fresh ingredients and they always have unique twists that work perfect with their items like clementine and pistachios in the guacamole, pastrami on a pretzel roll, banana gelato with chocolate peanut butter molten cake. Not the same ol', humdrum food.   I've been here when they're swamped and today they were quite busy, but the service is always the same. Genuine, welcoming and quick. We were seated immediately today, but, if you have to wait for a table, the drink service will make the time pass so fast. You'll forget you were waiting.   The short rib potstickers are a must try in my opinion. My favorite salad is the ahi tuna salad. The Brussel sprout Caesar is a close 2nd. Their coolers and signature sodas are great too.   Speaking of drinks, they have a fun cocktail menu with lots of beer and wine options. Then there's the coffee bar. Either way, you won't be disappointed.   Sam Fox does a great job creating his concepts and hiring people great that deliver the experience. I just wish I lived closer. I would be a regular for sure!  P.S. I love the spoon tie clips!",

I give it a 3.5 out of 5..when we arrived it wasn't quite open yet but the coffee bar was open.. they had selected breakfast menu you could order along with  pastries which looked delicious.. as soon as we got seated we ordered the short ribs dumpling, chicken fried chicken (biscuits and gravy) and cheddar popovers.. for the most part everything was good but the short ribs, we weren't expecting it to taste the way it did.. it wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing either.. I didn't like the sauce they served it with wasn't served on the side.. they had the sauce and the dumplings all in the same bowl.. we probably will be back to try their other items on the menu but won't be ordering the dumplings again.. and wished they gave a lil more gravy with the chicken fried chicken .. last thing I have to say is our server was good in the beginning, attentive.. but as soon as we got our food he stopped coming around.. it wasn't to busy yet so we were kinda waiting for a bit before we get a box and our check..",

I really love the ambience of this restaurant, it has an upbeat vibe and is full positive energy. It does get a little loud, so don't expect an intimate setting.  I love, love, love the Short Rib Potstickers and Korean Style Skirt Steak. If they ever remove either one from their menu, they must provide me the recipe! The potstickers have an amazing sauce that is just out of this world, but is so simple at the same time. I'm not a big beef eater, but I always make the exception for the Korean Style Skirt Steak. They serve it with a very flavorful rice that I can never get enough of.   I've tried many other great things on the dinner menu and I never left unsatisfied. This is surely one of my favorites in the Arcadia area.",

The breakfast scene is lively between business or work people meeting and moms dropping in for coffee after delivering the kids to school, etc.  the baristas handle the load and the kitchen delivers.  My favorite bfst is the California burrito.  Lunch is more of the same as far as it being a great place for a work lunch.  The food is all good and a wide choice so all can be happy.

It was busy, that's why we made a reservation.  We then waited 30 minutes for someone to take our order. There were four different people serving us, which was confusing and hard to get someone's attention. We all liked our food: BLT, Quinoa Wrap and Spicy Scramble.  Twice we asked for coffee refills and the coffee was luke warm both times. Our coffee was quickly replaced with fresh cups. The coffee was delish. They need better carafes to keep coffee hot.  We were in a comfortable booth and over-all enjoyed our meal and time there. The staff seemed somewhat frantic and disorganized, but everyone was cordial and very nice. We'll definitely return for dinner. I just hope service is better.",

After some seating issues we got to look over the menu and figure out what we wanted.  I knew before I got there that I was interested in the Carrot Cake Pancakes, I love love love carrot cake and I love pancakes, so why not have the best of 2 worlds in one. Right?  The pancakes had salted pecans, golden raisins and cream cheese frosting, but it was missing the carrot for me! I love a real carroty carrot cake so I was somewhat disappointed. My friend ordered the chicken fried chicken and we exchanged bites and man that was amazing chicken fried chicken, can't wait to go back for that!   Breakfast was good; company was great, looking forward to the next BCUYE!",

The food was good, but I probably wouldn't wait out that long for something I didn't absolutely love. I got the grilled chicken, which was tasty, and the whole meal was very filling! It's a cute location, and taking a photo by the sign out front is a MUST! I hear dinner really good, so I might have to go back for that. I wouldn't mind waiting if it wasn't so hot outside, and there was more room to wait inside. While we were waiting, we had to stand the entire time. I just suggest going when it's not as hot, so you can wait it out outside since it can get cramped. 5 stars if the wait wasn't so long!",

Crossed my fingers that we could get in as I needed a reservation for the next day which was my birthday on a Sunday at 11. Open table let me book 6 and then I had to call the restaurant to add 2 more which they accommodated at 1115.  Pulled in after Church at about 1050. Reservations were for 1115.  Adorable spot with beautiful decor. Parking is full so drive through to the back but it's free.  We waited outside and got seated at 1125 at a round table on the patio. Adorable. Not too hot and we were mostly covered.  Our server, Sara was a delight. Very enthusiastic and she knew it was my birthday. So sweet and helpful.   One of our guys said to surprise him with a drink. It was funny because they forgot it and she joked with us that it was the surprise. The coffees were delish and most also had a brunch cocktail. We were informed that the bloody mary cart can't come outside up the stairs but I ordered a virgin spicy bloody and it didn't come halfway through my meal. When one of my friends told Sara, she apologized and got right on it. The lady came up and brought it at no charge. And the surprise drink for my friend that they didn't bring cause it had no protein powder was also on the house. Very nice.  They did bring an extra order of French toast by accident and said to enjoy it. All the food deliverers kind of mixed up the plates as they sat them down.  You should have seen my hubby's face when they tried to give him am omelette that looked healthy cause he ordered the carrot cake pancakes. All in all, the food was good and even though so many little things went wrong...the service thanks to Sara was really great.  Appreciate her putting up with us and even bringing me bread pudding dessert as a present.  Beautiful posh interior and high quality everything. I'm glad I got to treat my friends to a nice brunch and we could see camelback pretty much Birdseye view across the street.  We went home and changed and climbed it!   Great  birthday brunch.",

We went early before a concert and it was busy at 5:30pm (in summer).  It appears that they attract a big happy hour crowd. The set-up is a little confusing if you've never been here but the staff was friendly and welcoming.  I loved the atmosphere and the food was yummy!    I started with the strawberry rhubarb collins which was tasty and refreshing.  The popovers were good but a little bland.  I had the quinoa tacos and they were amazing.  The tacos are small but full of flavor and surprisingly filing.  I also tried my sister's chicken with creamed corn.  Love the creamed corn!  It's just like the corn at The Greene House.  It sounds weird to be so excited about corn but it's really that good!    I frequent other Fox restaurants that are closer to me but I would certainly return to this one if I'm in the area!",

All of the items on their menu have solid flavor combinations that made choosing just one a challenge.   We ended up with the short rib potstickers, which were delicious (super tender meat filling!) but also a little pricier compared to other appetizers. I also split the Roasted Turkey French Dip with a side of Kale and Apple Slaw. I wasn't a fan of the kale slaw, but the sandwich was fantastic, especially with the jus for dipping. I loved the kick from the horseradish too!  For dessert, we had the bread pudding, which was huge! Definitely big enough for the table to share (we had two people and couldn't finish), and had a great fluffy texture!

Price:  Reasonable for sit-down service in the Scottsdale area.   $70 for 3 people for lunch.  Atmosphere:  Trendy, vibrant.  Not very quiet... lots of different formats (bars w. stools, couches, tables, booths) inside and outside seating.  Feels like a bustling Starbucks.

Looks simple-unimpressive but looks are deceiving!   One of the best pastries I've ever eaten!  We had great mimosas  They are hand crafted and delish.  We ordered short rib potstickers, smoked Norwegian salmon, and guacamole for appetizers.  All delicious!  Turkey cobb salad with buttermilk dressing was yummy!  Wild mushroom radiatori was wonderful. All American burger and roasted chicken were excellent too.   Nothing we ordered was marginal or just ok-all high quality and worth eating!   Make reservations early or you'll never get a table....",

They do a nice job with their food, but it does tend to be a little rich and over buttered. Their coffee is fantastic! The ambience is also nice, and it is fun to people watch. If you live anywhere within a 5 mile radius, you are bound to run into people you know. There are tables with plush chairs inside and out on the patio. During the fall, winter and spring, it is a phenomenal patio experience. During the summer, not so much. All in all, I recommend that when you have some time to kill on the weekend, you try the Henry's coffee bar at least once.",

The ambiance of the restaurant was nice. Surprisingly went here on Friday night and there was no wait or reservation needed only if you wanted to sit on the booths. The food was average, nothing too exciting to rave about considering this place is more geared towards the higher end of the pay scale. I ordered the  braised short rib w/ mashed potatoes and roasted mushrooms, and girlfriend ordered the Korean Style Skirt Steak. The skirt steak was a bit salty possibly overdoing the sauces being put on. Other than that, average dinner with prices exceeding what the food was worth.",

It is an elevated Fox Restaurant and definitely one of the best ones. Everyone who's been here and reviewed have already raved about how great it is so I guess I will just talk about everything I have tried here:  Cheddar popovers: WOW! it wasn't love at first sight, but once you pop one in your mouth, it is so soft and delicious with just the right amount of cheesy flavor.   Guacamole: if I remember correctly, I was avoiding the mandarin oranges in it but other than that, it is great and served with soft pita.   Korean short ribs: phenomenal, meat was juicy and seasoned to perfection. I had this back in May for my birthday and am still dreaming about it.   Bread pudding: really good. I can do without the dried fruit but thats just preference.  For breakfast - spicy sausage scramble: SO SO good. fluffy egg with perfectly seasoned chicken sausage, and fresh veggies (spinach, onion, zucchini, CORN) ... I'm not big on scrambled eggs and omelettes but this was amazing  Grapefruit juice - yummy   The Henry is always a good idea in my book.",

Unfortunately I had a bad experience on my first time here where the hostess forgot we were standing there waiting for a table. 20 minutes pass and they no longer offered the lunch menu. They were nice enough to let us order off of it when we decided to leave but ended up staying to give it a shot. Pretty disappointed with their guacamole as it was somewhat plain tasting and not worth the price. The chicken sandwich was pretty bland and not really special.  French dip sandwich was pretty good though. I probably would not return due to the price and the bad experience. There are plenty of other restaurants in the area that have more flavorful dishes.",

    "text": "We had the worst and most embarrassing experience.  I came in at 4pm Friday Jan 20th for a business meeting and asked for a table. The hostess asked to clarify what I planned to order and insisted that the dining area was full service. I explained that I wasn't quite sure (only 2 of roughly 30 tables was occupied) I was hopeful to be seated. She explained that they anticipated a busy night and again demanded to know if I would be ordering \"full service.\" I again asked if I could please be seated. Unfortunately I wasn't prepared for hostility from a \"hostess\" nor did I expect to provide a digest of what we had planned to order so I was stunned and unsure how to respond to her demands since I wasn't sure what my party planned to order. She refused to seat me. I asked to speak to the manager. The business person I was meeting had arrived and scanned their eyes across the fully empty restaurant and asked why I was sitting in a chair waiting and what was the problem. Having met this person for the first time my face was beet red and embarrassed; my answer was I was trying to get a table. They looked highly confused as their eyes scanned the empty establishment and I was overwhelmed with embarrassment. The hostess returned after 5 minutes (it felt like an hour) and said she could seat me (remember I asked for the manager and at 4pm the restaurant is 80% empty). I again inquired who the manager was and she pointed to a young gentleman 5 feet from me. He was clearly aware of the issue but clearly had no plans to respond until I approached HIM. When I approached him he seated us and explained he was confused why there was a problem and why the hostess even came to him since they were not serving full service, only appetizers. He also said she had been there a long time so he was shocked. He shouldered the blame to her and was unfazed. He was clearly not the least bit concerned about my experience. I on the other hand was off to a tremendously embarrassing meeting. I had no choice but to rebound so I could carry on with the meeting but I was left stunned, and still remain stunned. The hostess was incredibly rude; beyond belief. The manager was unconcerned and unfazed and offered nothing to sooth my shame and embarrassment; or improve or enhance the experience. I still can only scratch my head at this experience. It was off-putting to say the least. Highly apathetic, unprofessional, and disrespectful to customers; thats the summation of it. It was very hurtful to say the least; not to mention completely unnecessary. Sad.",

    "text": "Sam Fox is normally renowned for such great restaurants.  That's why this one was such a surprise.  We made reservations for a party of seven and asked for a specific table.  When we arrived, the table we asked for was not available.  I've been in the restaurant business for many years now and I understand that restaurants cannot always guarantee specific tables.  That's fine.  However, they crammed us like sardines into a booth.  The place is incredibly noisy so, even though we were incredibly close, we couldn't really hear each other. Now, I like to study and peruse the menu, so, as a courtesy to my fellow diners, I do it ahead of time on the restaurant's website.  We were eating at 1pm on a Saturday so, stupidly, I decided to check out the lunch menu.  When we arrived, we were only allowed to order off the breakfast menu.  At one o'clock.  On a Saturday!  Now, every restaurant I've worked at, from low end to high end has been able to accommodate any menu request at any time.  It's just basic customer service. So, disgusted, we began to peruse the breakfast menu.  About 25 minutes into our meal, we FINALLY received glasses of water on the table.  And little did we know that we should have cherished the water as it was the last we'd see. The food was decent - not great but not bad.  However, the whole meal was horribly marred by the substandard customer service.  There are so many great restaurants in this area that I find no reason to ever return to this one.",

    "text": "I was out of town for Mother's day so my kids took to my favorite restaurant, The Henry, for Sunday brunch.  We love this restaurant.  We love the food,  the staff, the atmosphere and especially the energy of this place.  Having said that, the customer service today, was seriously lacking.  We had to constantly flag down waiters to get service.  We placed our original coffee, water and drink order and one of the coffees was not delivered.  That is not a big deal, however, we had to ask multiple servers if we could get the other cup of coffee, that we ordered, and we had to wait forever to get it.  By the time my son finally got his coffee, my husband and I were already done with ours.  The same thing happened with our refills on our coffees, refills on our waters and some of the food that was not delivered.  Again, when we did ask for stuff, it took forever for it to be brought to us and sometimes we had to ask multiple servers to get it delivered.  Our server did not seem to realize that this was happening either.  He was super nice, just not observant, or attentive, to our needs. We are in the customer service business, so we know what good service is and are not needy or demanding customers.  Also, even though there was a clear pathway to serve me, every server that brought anything to our table, served from the other side of the table.  Every one of them reached right across the front of my husband's face, to serve me.  It was terrible.  He had to actually lean back to be out of their way when all they had to do was walk around the table to serve me.  Someone needs to train them that this is bad etiquette and very rude.   We were all amazed that it didn't happen just once, but over and over again.  Lastly, we were seated at a cool table, on the patio, and two of us were seated against a wall with plants, on shelves, above us.  The final straw came when two of the staff came to get plants off of the wall above our heads.  I actually even asked if that needed to be done while we were eating and they did it anyways.  So unprofessional and unsanitary!!!  We asked for our check, and were getting ready to go, when the manager came to our table to ask about the plant situation.  We explained everything and told him that we love to come here, but this time our experience was way below par.  He offered a muffin to go and said he was sorry.  By then, the damage was done.  Just to be clear, we were there a good 90 minutes and never saw a manager until the very end.  Also, they were not swamped or understaffed, there were a lot of empty tables and plenty of staff to give good service.   I hope this is not the direction The Henry is going in, as it was really disappointing.  I really felt bad for my kids because they were so excited to take me here and have a great experience and that is not what happened.  To correct this in the future, I think the managers should be walking around their restaurant to see what is going on with their customers.  They should be helping their servers to be successful and be more aware and when they have a server that is struggling, they should be jumping in to help.  I am sure that at some point we will go back and give them a chance to make this right but,  it will be a while.  There are just too many other great restaurants that we can go to.",

I ordered the Porkchop and well the flavor was good the meet was one of the toughest I can remember ever eating. My friend commented that it looked like I was getting a workout just chewing my food, and that's how it felt. I will say that the bread pudding was amazing. Had it not been for that it would've been a total bust.The other people at my table both had the roast chicken and it was a sad looking plate and neither of them thought it was anywhere close to as good as a Costco rotisserie chicken tastes. With tip and drinks and two desserts the three of us spent $180 on a below average meal. We were scouting out a place to have our office Christmas party, suffice it to say we will not be holding it there.",

Although the food is fantastic, I come here just as much for the Gin and Tonic No. 8.  Best G&T ever!!  Nolet's Gin, grapefruit peel, grapefruit bitters, tonic.  Wow, amazing!  Still trying to recreate it at home... I have been here maybe 8 times.  Never had a bad dish.  the short rib is amazing.  The Skuna Bay Salmon is really good - and I'm from Seattle and rarely order salmon outside of the west coast.  Had a new black cod dish tonight with a coconut sauce - delish!  All the sides are good, all the starters are good.  Like I started with - never had a bad or even mediocre dish here.  Service is usually quite good - prompt, knowledgable on food and the drinks, but not overly formal or pushy.  Fun, lively ambiance - kind of upscale business casual.  Love the patio - if it's a little cool they have the heaters on.  If it's hot, they have misters on.  So you can be outside in most temps unless extreme.  Like I said - my go-to place!!",

We arrived around 4 thinking we would have a cocktail or two and ended up staying thru dinner.  The bartenders Teddy and Jeremy were outstanding. My husband enjoyed talking to Teddy about different whiskeys and he recommended a couple that he tried. The bonus was the Pappy that they had, that my husband has been looking for for months in the Bay Area. Also recommended were the popovers which were very yummy. The smoked ham butter was amazing. We ended up ordering the chopped salad, club sandwich and a side of the cauliflower polenta. All were served quickly and enjoyed to the fullest. Ending our meal with the bread pudding, served warm with a scoop of carmel ice cream that was delicious. I also want to note the open feel of the restaurant, where you are able to sit outside, at casual tables, at the bar or in the dining room. I'd recommend this restaurant to everyone to try. You won't be sorry.",

The burger was very good, the salad was plated beautifully and tasted delicious, which is impressive as our family is not that big on salads.  Two of us at the table ordered breakfast which was very tasty.    Unfortunately, the wrong breakfast was brought out the first time (mine), and so I had to wait while everyone else ate their meal.  Mistakes do happen, and our waitress, Kayla, was  dedicated to fixing the mistake and making sure we were taken care of.

I've never knowingly had Bulleit Bourbon.   The manhattan was good, but I think the BB is not my first choice.     Ron was our server.   Very friendly, professional, competent server.   We ordered the Korean tacos, which I have no idea what made it \"Korean,\" but it was good although I'm not a fan of corn tortillas.   They aren't very big, two on a plate.   I'd skip the tortillas, unless they could use flour, and just have the topping.  Our other order was the truffle oil fries.   They were good.   Came hot.     If you are going for happy hour, probably a good idea to get there soon after opening.   We did get a seat, but it was between the two entrance doors.   Therefore, every time it opened, the warm air made its entrance.",

First let me say I have no photos because I was catching up with my friend and we left our phones away. ( kind of nice!) Walked in to where the coffee bar is. Wasn't sure where to go.... there were people sitting everywhere. After a bit I asked the barista as to where we go to be seated.  After waiting just a bit... we were seated at a two top.  I must say..... wasn't the best seat. Tables so close together. No privacy.  That probably was the only bad thing.  Service was terrific. Food was delightful. Drinks were exceptional.  Decided after lunch to grab a specialty coffee and dessert and sit somewhere that we could actually talk.  Only complaint here is large tables in back room with one person sitting at them. I get the community idea..... but it isn't working.  One individual taking up an entire table.  Wound up outside ( even though it was 100 degrees) but it was the only space left.  Not sure if or when I'll be back.",

The most recent visit was for Sunday brunch, we made sure to make reservations for our party of 6 otherwise they tend to get busy. We were promptly seated at our reservation time and started the meal off with some mimosas. Then we got the short rib potstickers and they were delicious! So delicious in fact, we had to get a second order. We also got an order of truffle fries, which were perfectly seasoned. You could taste the truffle flavor without it being too overwhelming. An order of chips and guacamole was next, the chips were a little greasy but the guac was good. For my entree I opted for the California scramble, a blend of eggs, cheese, bacon, potato, avocado and salsa. It was delicious. Not too heavy, but the perfect amount of food. Other people at my table got the bagel and lox, reported it was tasty as well and the huevos rancheros. Our waiter was also very friendly, and the entire experience was wonderful. I will definitely be back!",

Once at our table it was another 10 before we were greeted. Once greeted the guy took our drink orders then in the middle of us ordering food, our actual waitress came over and took over our table. We had to reorder everything with her which was alittle annoying. Once we ordered our food took another 40 mins. My dates burger came out well and he order med rare and his Brussels sprouts were charred to a crisp and not even warm.   My date asked for ketchup and he had finished his burger long before she ended up bringing it.   My turkey French dip left a lot to be desired taste wise and wasn't worth the money but the truffle fries were really good.  Overall we were very disappointed in service, and food, which sucks because I was hoping the experience was as nice as the ambiance.",

    "text": "This adorable coffee shop is located inside of The Henry, which I adore. The entire space is decorated beautifully and I could hang out here for hours. The pastries look delicious, but during my recent visit, I ordered a hot vanilla latte and a co-worker ordered the Wildflower (vanilla, espresso, steamed milk, and a splash of chai). The espresso was a little strong and not too sweet, even with the vanilla. My co-worker enjoyed her drink as well. I would definitely come back for another latte. This place is great for breakfast/brunch and if you need something stronger than coffee, head to the bar. Overall, I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Fabulous ambiance and delicious food and lovely service!  Went for dinner on a Sunday evening - we had reservations for our party of 6. Were seated within 5 minutes of arriving.  I informed our server that I have to be gluten free and she told me she'll make sure to alert the kitchen, adding she would not allow me to get sick on her watch  Started out with the White truffle Parmesan fries - so good! My entree was the beef braised short ribs with blue cheese mashed potatoes and roasted mushrooms - I cleaned the plate up  So good! The others ordered Skuna Bay salmon, seared ahi tuna, Korean prime skirt steak, and portobello tacos with chicken - everyone was pleased with their choices.  My dessert was the vegan carrot cake as it's gluten free too - moist and yummy!! The others enjoyed sharing the warm croissant bread pudding!  The only disappointment was the coffee - I ordered The Butcher and it was not good nor hot.  Other than the coffee, a fabulous meal!  And I didn't have any reaction so they were good for my celiac diet",

What's great is you can come in and use it as a meeting spot or plug in and enjoy a cool workspace environment and the seating is open so plenty of choices on how you want to structure your visit. Lunch gets busy so make a reservation and parking can be difficult at any time during the week. Plenty of variety on the menu, good space for large meeting groups and a neat private dining room. Did I mention Bloody Mary cart for brunch...Do it!",

The bartender helping us was friendly and attentive. They have a few wines on tap that are good and reasonably priced (they also have bottled wine as well). My husband ordered the Turkey French Dip, which he enjoyed, and I had the Spring Harvest Bowl.  I am not a vegetarian, but love when restaurants put thought into their vegetarian dishes. It was so delicious, and I would definitely order it again. I loved the decor as well. We would definitely visit The Henry when in the area again.",

    "text": "Look up \"bourgeoisie\" in the dictionary. You won't see \"The Henry\" but it'll describe the Henry to a T.   \"A sociologically defined class, especially in contemporary times, referring to people with a certain cultural and financial capital belonging to the middle or upper stratum of the middle class: the upper (haute), middle (moyenne), and petty (petite) bourgeoisie (which are collectively designated \"the Bourgeoisie\"); an affluent and often opulent stratum of the middle class (capitalist class) who stand opposite the proletariat class.\"  This is a restaurant and coffee shop, but it is without a doubt the bougiest coffee shop in greater Phoenix. Part of this might be a function of the location. Smack in the middle of Arcadia, just south of Paradise Valley, across from A.J's Fine Foods and the Village, short of Thompson Peak, this is as bougie as Phoenix gets.  The architecture and decor piles it on. The Henry was built to give that country club feel, and it succeeded. The thick, white colonial style moulding. The arborvitae out front forming perfect hedges. The wrought iron. Everything screams \"Hamptons,\" including the people.  The people at the Henry are uniformly bourgeoisie or aspiring bourgeoisie, and the Henry is aware of this and price their coffee accordingly. The demographics are both a function of the Henry's location in Arcadia, and it's placement just enough off the beaten path that it takes real intention to come here. It's not a coffee shop a pleb will stumble upon when doing errands or coming home from work. It's neither a quirky indie corner shop nor a convenient daily quick fix. There's no drive-through, no convenient parking (without a great deal of luck), no glaring sign saying \"get your coffee fix here.\" No one driving is likely to make a spontaneous decision to swing through. It's not so much a coffee shop than an establishment. Well-heeled Phoenicians - lawyers, architects, realtors and developers, and let's not forget the profitable housewife demographic - seem to make the Henry a destination.  This makes people watching at the Henry unique. It's the type of place where you see people of a certain class bump into an acquaintance or two. Steve, with the cashmere sweater draped around his shoulders wasn't expecting to see Roy in the polo and boat shoes, but when he does he'll give his shoulder a squeeze and say \"ROY, good to see you buddy, how's the market\" or something. And seeing Roy will give Carol, Susan and Vicky at the high top with the wine a five minute diversion to delve into Roy's affair, or his divorce, or the Tesla he lost in the divorce. Occasionally you'll see a grad student or two studying here, but it isn't frequent. The Henry is more sip and gab than pound and grind.  Fox found a niche in the market and have exploited it with gusto. In greater Phoenix, I'm not aware of any other place that screams country-club-casual coffee without requiring a membership. No half-measures here - the Henry caters to the second-home-in-Flagstaff crowd with no apologies. It may not be everyone's scene, but after all, that's the point.  As for me, I'm not sure I quite make the cut yet. Maybe someday. First I'll need to own a cabin in Prescott. Then, with my firm turning a nice quarterly profit, perhaps I'll schedule a lunch meeting at the Henry with a prospective client or two. When I'm waiting in line, I'll glance across the room and see Danny, who'll come over and squeeze my shoulder and say \"MARK, taking the boat out this weekend?\" And I'll say \"DANNY, good to see you buddy ol' pal, I'm off to Napa until Tuesday. The boat will have to wait.\" And then we can briefly talk about the market before exchanging guffaws and goodbyes.  Until then, I'll have to cool my heels somewhere where the ceilings are a little lower, the moulding a little thinner, and the coffee a little cheaper.",

The sandwich and fries were unfortunately both a bit on the bland side.  Kind of a bummer for a place with such a cool vibe.",

    "text": "Probably one of my favorite Fox Restaurant Concepts. I have been here twice and both times were phenomenal. The first time I went I balled out and got multiple appies (appetizers) along with my meal and dessert. I feel like I should be guilty for eating all of this food but I am not because I loved trying multiple things they had to offer. I have tried the short rib potstickers, popovers, truffle fries, guacamole, and the goat cheese toast appetizer. With the exception of the truffle fries (didn't really care too much for them) all of the starters were incredible. Main entrees: first time got the braised short rib and freakin loved every bite of it. Second time I got the Korean style steak with vegetable fried rice and damn, they just know how to cook their beef. It was perfectly medium with really great flavor and the vegetable fried rice was on point! First time I went I got the bread pudding for dessert which was fantastic but the second time I got the peanut butter chocolate molten cake and was not too happy with it because it wasn't really a molten cake I was expecting chocolate to be gushing out of the cake and was sad I didn't see that...But overall the ambience, food, and service is all worth coming here. Just expect to spend a little more than average for dinner.",

We sat outside and watched all the fancy cars roll up, which was kinda fun. The back patio had pretty lights all around. And the food, was of course, totally legit. We split the cheddar popovers and ate all of them. I got the fatoosh salad, which although it was heavy on the dressing, I had no trouble polishing off. My husband really enjoyed his corned beef sandwich. The service was great, and I appreciated the manager coming out to check on us. She even asked if the dressing was too heavy and offered to make a new salad, which I declined because I don't like to send back food. But the offer was much appreciated. Overall, great experience.",

We love all the Fox restaurants and this one did not disappoint!  My girls and I can't have gluten so I called she ahead to see if the kids Mac n cheese could be made gluten free and is the short ribs was. I was told the short ribs were gluten free but they had no gluten free pasta. The manager got on the phone and I asked if he could get GF pasta if I made a reservation this weekend. He said no problem, he would stop at the store on his way in on Saturday.  When we arrived we all loved the atmosphere of the place. There was lots of outdoor seating and the inside was beautiful. It reminded me of Chelsea's but much larger, brighter and not as loud. They didn't offer any crayons for the kids but I always bring my own. We just asked our server for paper and the kids were happy. We ordered the Parmesan fries which were delicious. The kale salad was fantastic! The cheddar vinaigrette was delicious. The short ribs did not disappoint! They were tender and cooked to perfection on top of mashed potatoes. My dad ordered the steak sandwich and he loved it. My girls loved their homemade mac n cheese and our reservation was already noted to use GF pasta.  It came with broccolini or fruit. My kids got the broccolini and loved it.   Dessert was delicious. My husband had the key lime torte which was gluten free so I had some. It was excellent. The salted caramel ice cream my 4 year old ordered was to die for! My parents enjoyed their bread pudding. Overall this place was really great! The manager checked in with us and remembered our conversation 3 days prior about gluten. I will definitely be coming back to this place! It's a great place for date night or to go with friends. Taking kids isn't bad either. We sat in a booth which kept them contained.",

    "text": "Attended this establishment last night for a friends birthday.   The building is a cool design and looked great we were all excited to try it out.   We sit at our table and are greeted by our sever Sarah.   I have to say I have never been treated so rudely in all my life and either had the other people in our party.   After having a round of drinks and some starters out sever comes over again to see if we would like to order. We ordered more drinks and our main meals.  The girl server asked some of us for our ID's and stated I was 19 once I know what you guys are like??? I was the youngest at the table and she didn't ask me????  We are all late 20's to 30's and all professionals. Going to what is suppose to be an up market restaurant with a sever saying comments like that it just doesn't float with me. One of the girls didn't have her ID. Meanwhile it's her birthday!!!!! So the mood of the celebration changed the manager come out after our complaints to the sever and \"Apologised\" there is nothing he could do even after serving us drinks prior??  Our party felt so unhappy and uncomfortable that we decided to leave.   I went and asked for the cheque and explained due to the server being rude and the fact they now ruined our night we would like to pay for what we have had and leave to go somewhere else.   The manager and I became engaged in a heated argument in the middle of the restaurant started by him raising his voice at me because he said we ordered mains and we have to have them or pay for them or he would call the police for theft and not paying a bill??? Who says that to a customer??  I clearly stated we haven't eaten the food and it was ordered in the middle of our complaint which hadn't been dealt with.   The manager proceeded to inform me he would call the police I said fine please do call them as I was asking for my bill to pay what we had had already and it is not my fault that experience was ruined by rude people.   He then told me the I need to leave the restaurant as I am trespassing and if I didn't he would again call the police. Meanwhile my party was still at the table waiting for me to return. I complied to his request with the question what did I do other than complain.  Is this really how your restaurant deals with complains by threatening to call the police??  The manager continued to yell at me even when I was outside. Finally he calmed down and said fine and gave me a bill for what we had eaten and drank and said pay this now!  For a manager to yell, scream and threaten a paying customer is disgusting. I have eaten at many places all over the world and I have to say this was and most likely will be the WORST experience I have had at an restaurant.   What happened to customer service???  The fact the manager still requested I pay after his and his staff members performance is an absolute joke.   Clearly the guy needs to get a new profession because customer service is certainly not his thing.   We went to Chelsea's kitchen down the road and had a great experience after all that.   Maybe the owners need to take old mate down there to Chelsea's Kitchen to learn respect, manners and customer service!!  Just saying!!!!!!",

Two drinks two glasses of wine one appetizer and two entrees $143.00.    The one odd/ maddening thing occurred when I order a glass of wine and they bring the cheapest restaurant wine Glass glass for the wine.  I asked if I could have an actual Crystal Glass and she said she ask.  Back she comes with the \"Good\" glasses. Normally we only use these glasses with the reserve wines.  The wine for $14 per glass was the Cheap non- good glass qualifying wine (Pine Ridge Forefront).  The shrimp was shrimp Grilled and then Chilled $16. Nice size shrimp.   The black cod though was absolutely a melt in your mouth fish experience. Never have tasted a fish that was so succulent. My dinner companion had the Salmon. She could barely eat it in comparison- if you go, just have the Cod you will kick yourself and want it afterward.  The place is loud and if you're looking for a a place with no intimacy and you have $150 for dinner for two, this could be your place.    PS - don't forget to ask for the good wine glasses - we all deserve good wine glasses, even if we don't buy a bottle over $100",

The Henry however is a more relaxed casual feeling but yet still manages to be high class. We went for breakfast and ordered the brulee grapefruit, smoked salmon, sample of pastries. Yeah that was just our appetizers! The smoked salmon is to die for, it is on top of some hash brown. Strongly recommend it! Over all our meals and appetizers were phenomenal and well worth the price, which wasn't too bad. Excited to try there dinner menu.",

They have the bar thing down. Breakfast is our favorite meal so we know omelets. The Egg White Turkey is perfectly prepared with plenty of flavor and filling. It's not the best ever, but certainly not bad. No words exist in the English language to describe the ingenuity of carrot cake pancakes topped not with standard cream cheese icing but a dollop of a butter infused with cream cheese. My cakes were just shy of fully cooked - 5 stars for the concept, 4 for execution - but the meal was still delicious.  Ron, our server, presented perfectly and knows his spirits, too. Live music was excellent.",

    "text": "I guess I may have to accept the fact that I'm always gonna have a bone to pick with Sam Fox.  Once again, I step into a restaurant that hits a home run on aesthetics but falls short on the cuisine.  Its seems to be a running theme that I just can't shake with Fox's concepts.  Perhaps its all a matter of playing the expectations game, but for the prices they charge I would expect something at least somewhat worthy of the decor I'm eating in.  But like so many of Fox's other concepts, the food leaves me with one emotion.  Meh.  The Henry is a newer addition to the Fox lineup, set in what was an old office building in the super trendy Arcadia neighborhood in east Phoenix.  The building itself is spectacular.  Its a two story structure that's open from the inside (though the restaurant only occupies the first floor).  The restaurant is actually three parts.  On the west side is a banquet area for private parties, on the east side is the main restaurant and a great outdoor patio complete with a fireplace, and in the middle is a little coffee and juice bar.  The furniture and wall paper have a pretty contemporary feel bordering on English tudor-ish.  The place has been jam packed since it opened but fortunately we didn't have to wait long on Sunday (we got a table in just under 10 minutes).  The dinner menu of The Henry has no rhyme or reason nor any discernible running theme.  I did pickup the fact that they use mushrooms in a lot of their dishes.  Great if you love mushrooms, not so great since I don't care for 'em.  For an appetizer we got some of the grilled artichoke hearts.  I love artichokes, but these tasted pretty bland.  And there weren't that many on the plate.  Worse yet, it was $13 for that little dish.  We also shared the white truffle fries with parmesan.  Much better.  Fries were cooked well and the truffle aioli was excellent.  They also come with a super spicy ketchup (seriously, it'll surprise ya).  My brother had mentioned some good reviews about the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich (particularly the BBQ mayo that comes on top), so I got that for my entree.  The chicken was fried adequately, but I didn't pick up hardly any of the BBQ flavor I expected.  For dessert I got the blueberry pie.  This saved the night.  Blueberries with greek yogurt on top and tiny hint of lemon zest.  Good, clean, simple, delicious.  My family also shared the chocolate cake and bread pudding, but I wasn't terribly impressed with how either of those tasted.  To drink, I had their homemade mixed berry lemonade.  Super refreshing drink as it wasn't too acidic or overpowering, but the big downside was the absurd amount of pulp in my drink.  My straw kept jamming up because of all the pulp getting stuck in there.  So just to recap.  Five stars for the ambiance and the friendly service.  No issues on either front there.  But two stars for the food.  As with so many other Fox restaurants I've been to, I feel like I'm paying three star prices for two star food.  And the items I ordered tonight were on the cheaper end.  The women in my family can't seem to get enough of whatever Sam Fox touches, but my experiences have been habitually average.  For happy hour, I probably wouldn't mind coming back here, but I'd probably pass if asked to come here for a full meal next time.",

The breakfast menu was not too extensive but there were a lot of tasty items to choose from. I decided on the 2 egg breakfast with bacon. I ordered my eggs scrambled and I think they may have been the best scrambled eggs I have ever had.  My hubby had the chicken fried chicken which came with biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were absolutely delicious.  I liked that I was also able to enjoy a Bloody Mary with my breakfast too. Our awesome server Adam told us that they actually have a build your own Bloody Mary cart on the weekends between 10a-2p. I am anxious to go back and give that a try.  If this was closer to home I'm pretty sure we would be here several times a month. We will definitely be back even with the drive because it was that good. Great food, unbelievable service and a cool atmosphere!",

    "text": "So a coworker chatted up going here recently and I thought I would treat my bestie to a nice lunch. They only take reservations on Sun for full dining since they get very busy but you can walk in and hope your wait time isn't too long. When you walk in, there is a nice bakery and coffee station if you're just in there to grab a quick cuppa. Off to the right of them is cafe seating. I had to go left past comfy chairs and sofa to find the hostesses who were seating for the dining area. They told me that it would be a wait so I put my name in. As I went back to the little bakery area, one of the baristas told me that the seating along the bar as well as these long, high tables with blue high-back chairs were also full-service and you would be served if you sat there. I opted for that. My friend showed up soon after. Right away a server came by, dropped off menus and took our drink orders. I had hot chocolate and both of us, waters. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and was able to steer us to good menu choices for someone who is vegan and needed gluten-free and other who wanted a hearty but healthy breakfast/non-vegan. Since we were both hungry, we started off with Parmesan fries with white truffle oil as an appetizer. Very, very tasty. She had the Flower Child scramble and I had the Egg white turkey omelette with Gruyere and avocado. Both came with potatoes. I have to say we were both ...underwhelmed. She asked for Cholula sauce to give her meal a little more Zing. We weren't quite sure if I had a turkey fillet? Or pressed turkey meat? We thought it was ricotta added in the middle but I think it might've been eggs not cooked all the way. Uugggh wished I had tried something else. Anyway I'm not sure if I will come here again anytime soon to try something else. I will say the wait staff and service was impeccable. Nice Fox concepts restaurant. We both enjoyed the live music singer.",

The food was good and pretty well priced and they have the best Moscow mule in the city and I love me a mule! The downsides were that it's so freaking loud in there you can't hear anyone, including your waiter. They need to adjust the acoustics. Seriously. And it took a long time to get our food, so long that a manager came out an apologized for it. Overall it was a pretty good experience. I would say that everyone seemed to be the Scottsdale over 45 crowd...who may wear their daughters jeans and have had some work done. But to each their own so if you are in the market for some good looking middle aged people go get yourself a drink and a date here!",

As I sat there eating my breakfast which was good i never got another visit by either and while the rest of the bar was being serviced, waters refilled they just skipped over me and I'm guessing because I ordered at the coffee bar and not from them.

    "text": "Boyfriend and I visited The Henry early on a Saturday night. It was a warm day so we sat outside on the patio which has a very pleasant, laid back atmosphere.  We started with an order of cheddar popovers, served with ham butter and herb butter. They come in an order of 3. They were good but not amazing. The butters were really good though. If they had a bread basket and served it with these butters, that would be a knockout.   For our dinners I ordered the pork chop and boyfriend got the Chevy Chase, which is a steak sandwich. He really enjoyed his sandwich a lot. The steak was done just right and the roll was fresh. The fries were cut really thin and were tasty as well.  My pork chop was delicious. First of all, it was huge - a very thick, bone-in chop. It was served with caramelized onions on top, a cauliflower \"polenta\" and chard. All the items were cooked to perfection and the flavors went together very well. The chop was tender and juicy, the chard was full of flavor and the cauliflower was a nice way to round everything out. Even the onions were good and I usually hate onions. I would definitely order it again.  For dessert we ordered the chocolate cake. It is served in a jar, which we were not expecting - we thought it would be a slice - but once we took at bite we didn't care how it was served, it was so good! It's ooey, gooey goodness in a jar is what it is. Get it, you'll love it.  I can see why this place has gotten so many great reviews and why they're saying this is the best Fox restaurant yet. I have to agree - from the atmosphere to the service to the food, this place is fantastic. I like all Fox restaurants, honestly, but this one does stand out as one of the top. I can't wait to go back and try their brunch.",

    "text": "I am somewhat conflicted on my feelings of The Henry. I've been there several times, and was pleased with most aspects. The lunch menu has some nice choices, and I was turned onto the Kale and Apple salad by one of the staff. Admittedly, I eat far too much crap, so adding the salad to my diet a few times a week is probably a good thing. Service for lunch was solid, no complaints.  Another time I sat on my lunch break and did some work on their WiFi, which was a bit slow, but hey, it's free. I ordered a coffee that was quite good, and the employee was more than happy to chat with me about some of the nicer cars in the parking lot. Good dude, and made good coffee. Definitely a fan of the coffee bar there.  The liquor menu is pretty diverse, and has some harder to find stuff on it, which is nice. They're lacking both Macallan and Highland Park though, which are must haves as far as I am concerned. I had a glass of the Yamazaki 18 there recently, which had nice flavor and complexity, but I'm definitely still a scotch guy. Nevertheless, the rise of Japanese whiskey is still relatively new, so it was cool to see it on the menu.  One thing that does bother me is that the higher ups appear to ride the employees pretty hard. My friends and I were getting lunch, and all noticed that the staff seemed to tense up when a manager would walk by. My server was killing it with our service, but I noticed he got pulled aside and chewed out for something. I've seen a few other people get grilled too. Granted, I don't work there or know what it's like for the managers, but the added tension when they're hovering around can be a bit uncomfortable. They've got a solid staff, let them do their thing.  I've generally been a fan of most of the Fox Concepts, but The Henry just seems like it's run too tight for my taste. The place has a ton of potential though.  Oh, and apparently breakfast ends at 10 and lunch doesn't start until 11, and in between neither menu is technically available to order from. You're essentially in food limbo for an hour. Who the hell though that was a good idea?",

The bf and I decided to risk showing up at 6pm without a reservation on the first Saturday night of its opening. 9:15pm was the first available table but we waited in the lounge area where you could order drinks and apps. After stalking a couple until they left, we grabbed a seat at the bar. For a busy night our server, Tanner, was awesome and attentive. As others have said it's loud, mainly because it's crowded not due to blaring music.   For drinks, I ordered the Vodka and Pulp. Delicious and not too sweet. My boyfriend had the Fig & Ginger Mule which was a tasty twist on the traditional Moscow Mule.  For apps we got the artichoke hearts. Grilled to perfection, flavorful and lined in a truffle aioli sauce. Perfect for two to share. We also had the smoked salmon on potato has browns. Came with 4 servings. Highly recommend this dish!   For entree, we split the Korean Style Skirt Steak. Winner winner amazing dinner. The combination of flavors and sauces made this dish outstanding. Steak was perfectly cooked to a medium rare. Ended with the bread pudding. It was good. I'm not huge bread pudding fan but my bf loved it. The caramel ice cream atop was delicious.   Oh, and they have a coffee and juice bar. Will have to try this and their breakfast next time!",

    "text": "The Henry is another home run for Fox Restaurant concepts. The extensive drink menu has an amazing selection of brown liquors and interesting concoctions. There is attention to detail in everything from decor to seasoning in the food  which makes this an amazing place to dine and drink.  Coffee this morning was flavorful and robust. The espresso beans didn't have an overpowering roast, but it will definitely wake you up in the morning.  I HIGHLY recommend the CB and Rye for lunch, as it is some of the most perfectly balanced, not too salty corned beef I've found. It keeps a meaty texture while still being incredibly juicy and tender. Excellent!  Bar menu can't be overstated. The cocktails were interesting and worth the price, and as a beer connoisseur, I appreciated that the only thing \"common\" on tap was Stella (4 Taps with rotating seasonal). The bottled beer selection showed sophistication and makes this a great place for a business happy hour.  The Henry would absolutely be 5 stars if it weren't for one big ambiance hindrance at a busy lunch -- it is INCREDIBLY loud in the restaurant. I heard about every 3rd word my server was saying and ended up a bit hoarse from talking so loudly to the people in my booth. If you're heading to the Henry at lunch time for a meeting, be sure arrange in advance and to ask for one of the more secluded meeting tables.",

The walls and high ceilings and lots of natural lighting that makes the place looks open and bright. I would love to come back here again sometime. The only downside was the customer service isn't as quite pleasant. Server wqs always In a rush and not that friendly. Also, the food can be better as well as the eggs were a little burnt lol. I am willing to try this again, this time for dinner. Nevertheless it's a good experience just a little room of minor improvements",

My boyfriend and I agreed this was \"Lux Coffeebar for grown ups\" and that we should hang out here more. Our waitress was lovely and bubbly, and gave us some complimentary macarons at the end of our dinner. We ordered the kale dip and both got the salmon with sunchokes (neither of us knew what they were until we asked. They're like a cousin to potatoes).

We got a nice corner booth. Our waiter wasn't cloyingly overfriendly, but he also wasn't very ... friendly. I ordered the carrot cake pancakes and a side of bacon; my husband got the two-egg breakfast (and coffees and OJs for both of us). Minutes after ordering, someone brought over the bacon, which seemed weird: I guess I'll just nosh on this bacon while I wait for my pancakes? But then the waiter came by and asked, \"Why did they bring you this bacon?\" and whisked it away. I got new(?) bacon when my meal arrived. The food was good, but not extraordinary. And the place is very noisy. Pretty sure we will cross this one off our to-try list and call it a day. Many other breakfast destinations in town are a better value and a more enjoyable experience.",

For the host to the management, the staff makes an effort to learn your name and great you by it every time (even if you're not sitting in there section that visit).  The atmosphere is so relaxing especially on the weekend when they have live music and the bloody Mary cart.  I love to go Saturday morning to kick off my weekend and after my meal just sit and plan out my errands for the rest of the day.  My current favorite item to eat is the quinoa breakfast burrito with bacon added.  It's a lot of food too so a nice dish to share with someone.  I usually can only eat half but that's ok with me; leftovers yes!   The only not positive thing, is that it's so popular parking can get a bit hard to come by. For lunch or dinner I recommend reservations which is easily to do through Yelp if you are set up on open table.  If you don't see the time you want available just go anyway and they work hard to find you table without much of a wait as well.",

No one rushed us out of the room, was sat and talked as people started to leave, and we didn't feel rushed at all.

I have been surprised because I have never met such unpleasant service... By the way they took the full price for their meal. Then, there was confusion with checks... the servers didn't know how to create separate bills for each guests so we were waiting them for an hour to pay... The most stupid thing I've ever seen when they gave us a check  - they took CAKE FEE !!! One minute, friend of mine brought her cake for BD party and they should just cut it for each person, about 16 people. I supposed to see it as complementary service in \"upscale\" restaurant, but they took a fees like 2$ from each guest!!!??? Seriously??? For what??? for you to cut it? or for your dirty plates? OMG, it the worst experience in my life! BTW they included 18% tips in every check and didn't forget to create one more line - ADDITIONAL TIPS!!! I guess for most drunk clients. I'll never ever go to this restaurant and won't advise to anyone to go there. That's it.",

Everything from the eclectic but spacious ambiance to the inventive dishes -- The Henry is the perfect choice for a quintessential weekend brunch.   We visited Phoenix from New York and The Henry was our first stop from the airport. Although it was only 10a, since we had been awake for 9 hours, we settled on some of the more lunchtime options: the Short Rib Potstickers, the Roasted Turkey French Dip, and the Brussel Sprouts Caesar Salad with Salmon.   All dishes were fantastic but the salad was truly original. Chopped brussel sprouts with four different types of lettuce in a perfect Caesar dressing. Every bite had such a beautiful blend of flavor and texture -- it was really amazing.   I also had a gourmet Bloody Mary, with infused vodka of your choice, bacon, olives, and the freshest herbs you could ask for (they were picked right from the plant!) made table side by a very kind Bloody Mary expert.   Finally, our server (a very sweet young lady) was very kind and accommodating. Great service all around.   Hands down, I would recommend The Henry to visitors and locals alike.",

For our main course, I ordered the flower child omelet which was incredible. It had butternut squash, which I was skeptical about initially but it made the omelet so unique! The potatoes were over cooked and blah, so I would suggest subbing for fruit.   My husband ordered the quinoa breakfast burrito and I was having trouble prying it from his deadlocked fingers for a bite. It was so tasty! Packed a lot of southwestern flavors and the avocado was the icing!   My friend ordered the chicken fried chicken and he was the first one done.

    "text": "Husband and I went for our anniversary. The food was excellent!! Unfortunately, the table was tiny and scrunched us up against people on either side of us--didn't expect that. We were asked if we were celebrating anything special when I made the reservation, but nothing was mentioned by anyone while we were there. The waiter talked me out of the wine I was going to order and confused me with his recommendations, so I ended up with beer, which was fine I guess. He needs some training on the finer points of waiting tables--he touched me several times on the arm, not sexually, but it kind of invaded my space. He left us with extra glasses and plates on our tiny table until we asked him to take them away, just added up to kind of weak service. Like I said before, the food was awesome. I recommend the pork loin and short ribs, and the bread pudding for dessert!",

    "text": "The thing we stumble upon when we live so far family and not able to celebrate mother's day with your family, but we have good friends we can spend time with. That's what happened on Mother's day, my friend, who came all the way from New York (trying to fake NY accent ) and me trying to explore Phoenix as much as possible within three days period. I've always wanted to try The Henry and now it is my chance. We booked our reservation and came in a little bit early (cause I was a little bit too excited and was hungry also ). It was confusing where we should go for the check. It took about 3 minutes for a hostess to check us in and show our seats. The ambience of this restaurant is just surreal. The decor on the wall, the open bar and the one thing I'm excited about is the OPEN kitchen. I can tell you the lights in the restaurant were very dim to give out the romantic chill vibe. At some point, all the lights turned very bright and it was very awkward to not to look at other customers eating beside us. Anyway, we were greeted by our server and she told us for our drinks. We told her it is our first time here, and asked her what she would recommend on the drink menu. I don't drink alcohol so she recommended this berry mixed sparkling drink and my friend ordered the Fig Moscow Mule. For the food, we ordered White truffle fries with parmesan cheese, I ordered Braised Short Rib and he ordered Wood Grilled Pork Chop. The fries came out and looked more like a whole entree itself because it was a lot of fries. It came with truffle aioli and a regular ketchup to dip on the side. You must try these fries because it is very good. Crunchy, not too greasy and have this slight truffle taste in it. The Fig Moscow is also a must have when you come to The Henry. However, my friend told me there wasn't enough fig taste to it and the drink was a little on the diluted side. Our entree took quite sometimes to come out and you'll see it won't disappoint you with your expectations. My Short Rib was little crispy on the outside from the caramelize and it just melted in my mouth. It was like butter. I don't really care much for the mashed potatoes, it was good also. The mushrooms were little bit salty for my liking. The Wood grilled pork chop was the star during our dine in. It was magnificent. There was light pink through out the whole pork chop, it was so tender and juicy. We kept wondering how can they keep the pork chop so juicy and it is wood grill. We were lucky when our server told us she could ask the Chef to talk to us if we want. So it was the highlight of our night when Chef Josh greeted us and told us his secret of making the dish. I was surprised that the hostility was so wonderful, beyond my imaginations. We weren't able to finish our fries cause we stuffed our belly with these excellent entree. Yet we can't live without trying the desert so my friend let me order Lemon Meringue Tart for us to share. I wanted to try their famous bread pudding but I know I wont able to finish it. So I ordered tart so it can be lighter. It was creamy, sweet and very tart. It makes me feel not so bad for eating the whole heavy entree after all! Our evening was so wonderful and I can't wait to come back in the near future to try other awesome dishes.",

I have the burger from the lunch menu and it was simply delicious. I have had burgers from most of the places throughout the valley known for their burgers, and this place has them all beat. Windsor has always been my favorite, but I think I have found a replacement. It is a very simple burger, but cooked perfectly with one of the softest buns I have ever had. Crazy soft, like air. Do not hesitate to eat the burger. Next time I will add bacon to it. I'm not kidding, they have the best bacon. Enjoy.",

She had barely any meat, all she had was the fat. No meat :( So she ate r he mashed potatoes instead, and her skn mac and cheese. Honestly,  I would of been fine with my white truffle Parmesan fries as a entree.  After our brunch, we walkes to get coffee, which was in the same restaurant. It was cute.",

(I'm only 130 lbs so it doesn't take a tremendous amount to fill me up).  I declined the atonement.  Perhaps I'll give them another try sometime...as the flavors were fabulous!",

I love the feel of it, very rustic and charming decor that really invites you in.   We sat at the bar and enjoyed some happy hour wine (on tap) and got some bites of food. the short rib potstickers were these awesome melt-in-your-mouth bites of goodness -highly recommend that. The fries were good too, HUGE serving of those and the brie toast was nice, nothing to write home about. I really liked the plating and the visual appeal of the food though, they do such a great job at all the Fox restaurants of recognizing we eat with our eyes first! Love the plating here. Overall, we had a blast, 2 hours flew by and my friend even got a yummy dessert and coffee with Baileys to complete our happy hour date. It was a great time, did the bar staff forget about us as they got busier - sure. Did the check come with a bit of sticker shock for a few apps, 2 wines and dessert - indeed. But its a great spot and I'd love to come back for brunch or something soon.",

It's really huge and a really cute restaurant. I would definitely say this place is hipster. It's somewhat noisy in there so be aware. Not bad though. The food and the coffee was really good. I got there at like 1:30. You can get lunch or breakfast. I'm a breakfast person so I got the le-pig egg sandwich and the dropout hot coffee. The two were very good. The coffee was Colombian and I have actually had Colombian coffee before and I could taste it in there which was pretty cool. I was very impressed with this place. My waiter could have been more lively. But I get it. I was a waitress once and everyone has their bad days. So I can give grace. All around though, 5 stars!",

    "text": "So why is it that when I learn that a restaurant is part of a chain my first thought is that it can't be that special? Maybe because when that's the case my assumption is that its food, its operation, its atmosphere, will all be standardized--in the bad meaning of that word. \"Standardized\" as in all the same, all repeatable, all not that special.  Funny how wrong your assumptions can be. (And by \"your\" I mean \"my\" :).   The Henry is part of Sam Fox's restaurant chain of what he calls his 50 or so \"concept\" restaurants. And yet The Henry totally rocks. Was there with Phoenix friends the other night and had a 5 star meal. Started with the absolutely divine cheddar popovers served with bacon and with dill butters. OMFG. Every meal should start like that. So completely wonderful a way to start a dining experience. Didn't think anything could top that until we each had a cup of the totilla chicken soup. Oh my double FG.... The most rich, succulent, layered, complex tortilla soup I've ever had. What a great way to follow up on the perfect introduction.   My honey and I next split an order of their roasted chicken and 2 sides which were all very tasty (the unusual cauliflower risotto and the more common but perfectly prepared Brussels sprouts are highy recommended). Finished with what was about the best caramel croissant bread pudding I've ever had, made even better by being topped with some delicious vanilla ice cream.   Wow! Sam Fox, you da man. I'm a fan and you've made me give up on my False idea that a chain restaurant automatically means mediocre eating. Thanks so much.  So sign me, David \"Chain-saw\" M",

    "text": "So my aunt and uncle were driving through town and they needed a recommendation on where to meet us up for lunch. Luckily I had heard some great things about The Henry from fellow Yelpers and had this place bookmarked for over a year! Decided on lunch here and so glad we did! The food was fresh as ever and the decor was nice enough without being over pretentious. I ordered the triple decker club sandwich which was loaded with the usual club ingredients but with a much fresher/cleaner feel than what I've experienced at other restaurants. For a side I had a small caesar salad which was great as well. My favorite thing I tried though was the mixed berry lemonade--great flavor that wasn't overly sweet but totally quenches your thirst on a hot day. The experience at The Henry was super positive and the wait staff was superb. I will be recommending it to my friends going forward.",

We ordered the asparagus Caesar and it literally had 6 pieces of lettuce.  We also ordered the BBQ heirloom carrot salad, which was a  slightly bigger portion but still very small.  They should be ashamed to serve these  $12 and $13 entree salads that are smaller than most side salads that other restaurants sell for $5 or $6.     Would have been zero stars, but both salads were delicious.",

I tried their Bloody Mary cart and I was very impressed. Of the six different house infused vodkas I went for the red pepper and olive. I have to say it was the best Bloody Mary I've ever had!

We came as a large party of 9, and were seated along one of the long, green benches in the restaurant. Everyone I was with, was impressed by the whimsical decor and the delicious looking menu. We ordered spiked lattes (upon request, and easily accommodated) but looked in envy at the awesome Bloody Mary carts that were around the restaurant. The carts looked adorable - glass carts with all types of Bloody Mary ingredients, and they get to make your drinks, customized right there and then for you. I digress in envy. The spiked lattes were strong and delicious, and hit the spot after a long sleepy morning. We ordered cheesy popovers for the table to start. The popovers come in three in a batch as well as with bacon butter. Yes, these things are delicious, addictive, and gone before you know it! I ended up ordering the Chicken Fried Chicken as an entree. The Chicken was cooked in buttermilk, too, the same seasoning as the biscuits, and it absolutely tasted like home cooking in my mouth.   Overall, it was an awesome dining experience, though I will make sure to dress up a little more formally next time. I need to go back for the Bloody Mary carts!",

Always made sure that either our drinks were refilled or if we needed anything else.

The decor is impressive; I spent half the time trying to imagine what my house would look like outfitted the same way. Like someone raided a Scottsdale flea market and knew what they were doing.  The staff is friendly and professional and pretty typical for the area. Food is what you would expect from a $10-15 entree; better ingredients are substituted for simpler dishes. My Bloody Mary, while being spicy and containing all the right things for a perfect drink was meh- I didn't actually finish it. I only mention this because the waitress made a to-do about the Bloody Mary Bar.  Definitely had worse, definitely had better (in my kitchen).  The coffee was lackluster also considering it came from the in-house coffee bar.  All in all, good stuff. Food was worth it, people watching and comfort were top notch, drinks were ok.",

My husband made a comment before going, that he guessed it would be 'hipster' in nature....overpriced food with small portion sizes. While the food was great and the ambiance wonderful, the portions were very small for the price (literally 6 tortellini pieces in a  pasta dish that cost $18). We went to eat sushi after because we were still hungry. However, I find that to be the case for most fancier type restaurants, so I wasn't really surprised by that.

I think I loved the Vodka and pulp and the Clubhouse margarita  When you first walk into The Henry you feel like you've been transported to a different time it's a classy place but you feel  Ike you are visiting a rich, old friend at the same time. We first sat on comfy sofas to enjoy our cocktails then went outside can you have the rest of our meal.I was with a group of very loud gals and no one complaint which was really nice. I enjoyed soup of the day a corn chowder that was warm, smoky and yummy.The Thai peanut black cod was extraordinary.  Sadly we did not have dessert but for the next time I plan on enjoying more dessert and fewer cocktails. Save your pennies for this place but it's worth using those Fox gift cards for.",

Second time however, the entire restaurant failed on everything possible, and I ended up leaving on an empty stomach after 2 hours. Place was loud, tables are very close together, the table next to ours was \"bro-fest\" and hence very loud.  The kitchen failed to deliver orders on time, other tables were served prior to ours even though we ordered first, both our orders were returned to the kitchen FOUR TIMES, and all four times they came back WRONG. We simply ended up not eating here and went elsewhere for breakfast. While the manager (Kolin) was apologetic, I do not think that his staff paid any attention to the failed orders.  I would not recommend this place due to the utterly lack of service and quality. I have never left a restaurant on an empty stomach, until my last visit at The Henry.",

    "text": "The Henry is a beautiful large comfortable spacious restaurant with one of the BEST lobbies I have ever seen. I like the cool modern retro kind of look and I also liked that they don't have car jockeys and you can just easily park yourself nice and close.   It's almost like two restaurants in one. You can order at a counter near the entrance and order off the board there and seat yourself or you can get seated in the dining room. I noticed the two menus are different.  They were very busy when I was there and had SEVEN hostesses on. Our wait was twenty five minutes for lunch.  Our waiter seemed VERY WELL Trained and was very hospitable.  We decided to split a salad and a sandwich for lunch.  I felt a little differently about the salad than my husband. The salad was full of beautiful produce and fresh grains and spiked with blue cheese for flavor. It was good but a little on the bitter side because of lots radicchio in it. My husband really liked the taste of the salad but didn't like the texture of fresh cooked squash in the salad. For me I thought it was missing something but it was still a good salad made with EXCELLENT ingredients.  Full Disclosure I am from the East Coast and have a certain way of what I think a corned beef sandwich should be like and what a Kaiser Roll should be like. I don't mean to blast The Henry for their artistic interpretation of a corned beef sandwich but from were I come from you might end up with new cement shoes and little fishes from the Schuylkill will be nipping at your noise for putting mayo on corned beef.  I'm not saying that other people wouldn't enjoy this sandwich but I don't think most people who know what a corned beef sandwich is MIGHT (or might not) be disappointed.  The C. B. and Rye.        (Oy Vey)  The roll was nicely flavored with rye and was VERY Fresh and delicate but wasn't like or resemble any kaiser roll I ever had and to me seemed more like a soft dinner roll. For me the roll didn't have enough structure to support the corned beef that I really had to bite threw. The corned beef wasn't tough but it didn't melt in your mouth either. The meat in my sandwich had snap to it and that feathery soft roll had to get squished. For me the flavoring was very mild for corned beef BUT still MUCH BETTER than the supermarket Boar's Head Brand because that stuff just sucks. The Mayo might have mellowed the flavor of the corned beef too. This seemed like the most interesting sandwich on the menu and I picked it because it was house made corned beef but it's a very watered down variation of what a corned beef can be.  While waiting in the lobby for my table I noticed other sandwiches that looked very good like the grilled cheese (available in the self order section) and someone at the bar had a burger that really looked pretty and just like those staged ones from a magazine. So I think your experience can be better than mine.  Give them a try see what you think.  This review is based on only one lunch visit.",

I had a chance to eat there this past Friday on friends and family night and I thought a review was in order. First the atmosphere, if you're familiar with the other Fox concepts you know that this is very important to them. The Henry's no exception with a slightly higher upscale feel than most other Fox concepts yet it's still comfortable and far from stuffy. It's obvious right up front that this is their pride and joy with plenty of attention to detail. The corporate offices are located right upstairs but you'd never know it.   For drinks they have an nice cocktail selection for both serious and more casual drinkers, the red stiletto and the white cranberry cocktail both received rave reviews from the ladies at my table. They also have house wines on tap...that's right...on tap. #15 also had a respectable craft beer selection, I had a Lagunitas lil sumpin sumpin and a double IPA out of Colorado, yum.   Onto the food. For apps we had the Swedish meatballs and the grilled artichokes. Neither stood a chance for our party of four but the artichokes were exceptional. If you're an artichoke fan definitely don't miss out on these.  For entrees we did two fish and two beef dishes. I had the Mediterranean Bronzino, it was served with wilted kale and it was phenomenal. The other fish dish ordered was a Pacific cod served in a savory broth, it's definitely a preparation you don't see often. Even the broth was gone at the end. The short ribs were classic, boneless and fall apart good. The final dish was the steak sandwich. My sister, a self professed steak sandwitch connisouir, compared it to the steak sandwich that was on the \"off the menu selection\"  for many years at Bandera, her favorite.   Dessert was the Warm Croissant Bread Pudding.....yeah!....and Salted Caramel Peanut butter Bars....oh yeah! I really enjoyed the bread pudding, the croissants give it new life. They also have a quality selection of coffee and expresso drinks. There's actually a coffee and pastry bar in the restaurant, almost bistro esque, if you just want a cup and a croissant to go in the AM or at lunch.   Honestly, the Henry is a hit in my book. Comfortable atmosphere, good food, good service. I'll be back for lunch and dinner and would recommend highly to friends. Next time I'm going for the Crispy half chicken.  -Ciao   P.S. They have a roasted garlic ranch that you would do terrible things to get your lips on. Seriously, order some on the side",

This is an experience very different than typical Fox.  Korean skirt steak with tempura green beans atop curry rice is not to be missed.  Tried the wife's roasted tomato black bean chili which was terrific as well, though the Korean skirt steak is in a whole other league.  Club house margarita was terrific.  Mule was good, thought I'd suggest it needs more ginger beer since the lime overpowered a bit.  Croissant bread pudding was very yummy, didn't leave one bit of that.  The space is really terrific, quite refined w/o being stuff.  Will be back to try their coffee shop and breakfast too.  btw, might suggest reservations.  You might have a long wait if not unless you get a seat at the bar.  Lounge area is very nice, comfortable couches and chairs so that's a pleasant place to hang out with a drink and appetizer.",

Hubby had the triple decker club sandwich, fresh ingredients and delicious. Sis had the bagel sandwich with smoked lox, cream cheese and all of the accoutrements.  Great salads and variety of soups and sandwiches.  Can't go wrong with this restaurant.",

During the week, you order breakfast from the coffee bar and it is delivered to you table.  I will say that I gave it 3 stars because it is beautiful inside.  I mean it...this space is amazing.  The coffee was gross.  The service was awful.  My scramble was dry.  The portions were quite small.  Maybe try it on the weekends when they supposedly have full service.",

We loved it so much we went later on Sunday evening, and didn't have the same experience with service.  We were there at 8:45, and very soon we felt like we needed to hurry.  As soon as my dining partner was done eating, his plate was whisked away.  Then she asked him about dessert and gave him the menu.  Meanwhile, I'm still working on my main course.  What does she expect, that he has dessert, leaves, and then does the whole dessert spiel all over again because I'm the only one remaining?  There's a difference between going out to eat, and dining.  That is what is the difference between 5 stars and 4 stars.  When waitstaff don't understand progression and timing of service and meals, then we're just grabbing a bite.  I still can't believe I'm being read a dessert menu when I'm still eating my dinner.  It really just ruined that evening's meal for me as I felt really rushed.  Otherwise, the food and atmosphere were still stellar.  I would continue to go back, but I'd be wary of a Sunday night, or the errant untrained waitperson who doesn't understand dining.",

Remember that I said \"11:30 AM on a Tuesday.\"  On arrival, I found parking at the restaurant to be nearly impossible; drivers were hovering in the parking lot waiting for someone to leave so as to secure a space.  I had to park off-site in order to make it to the appointment on time.  I was later told that the corporate folks from Fox Restaurants were conducting a meeting upstairs, and had impacted available parking.  If True, it is an interesting reflection on their customer service perspective.  Once inside, however, we found the service to be prompt and courteous.  Our server, Meagan, was great.  The food appeared quickly and was quite good.  My only reason for not granting 5 stars to this restaurant is the parking difficulty, and the degree to which the problem might well have been caused by the restaurant's own management.",

I ordered the branzino and chose sides of brussel sprouts and orzo.  The fish was an extremely skimpy piece and the brussel sprouts were tough and very hard. The orzo was by far the best food on my plate.....but it's pretty hard to screw up pasta. My daughter got the tuna poke bowl and again, it was VERY skimpy on the tuna. Not sure if the fish delivery didn't make it this week or what. All in all, a pretty disappointing meal. The ambiance was nice, but definitely not a place I would rush back to.",

It lived up to its reputation.  We went on a Saturday morning.  Called ahead to see what the wait was.  We were told 15-20 minutes. We arrived (parking was tough but we found a good spot.  yay) and were sat immediately at a bar top.  I love the huge ceilings and the immense personality (books, sofas, etc) inherent in The Henry. Service was fast and friendly.  I ordered a bloody mary and it was appropriately spicy.  Honestly, it was the best bloody mary I've had in a long time so I was quite pleased.  I ordered the huevos ranchero and it. was. amazing.  Beautifully presented, the eggs were perfectly cooked, the potatoes delicious and not too soft, not excessively crunch (juuuuuuust right).  I love the chip to egg to bean ratio.  And it was the perfect amount of food.  Based on the quality of food and service I would have expected the price to be astronomical.  But au contraire, it was very reasonably priced. If I was a local I would be going to The Henry all the time.  It has something for everyone.   Personality?  Check.  Amazing Food? Check.  Variety of seating options?  Check.  Fantastic place.",

My husbands huevos was a better choice with a nice mix of black bean and two cheeses and came with a side of potatoes, so better valve,  though the same overcooked potatoes.

The ambiance is classy and comfortable and the location is easy to find and there is ample parking. Their Truffle Bolangnes is fabulous and let it be known I'm not easily impressed! If there is a area that could be improved I would say it's their dessert selection. On our last visit (about a week ago) we ordered (their version of) the Apple Pie and honestly is was average in taste, texture and presentation, but don't let this detour you from checking out this restaurant because it checks off all the other boxes that I think have it qualify as a place worthy of repeat visits!",

    "text": "My, no, our, recent family experience at this establishment compels me to rate them at 5 stars.  It started out with the unwarranted trepidation that I felt when pulling into the parking lot considerably earlier than our planned arrival time. As had been my previous experience dining here during the lunch rush, it has always been packed, and parking is dreadful. I was consigned to anticipating a prolonged wait.  As we walked in, my daughter immediately notified the hostess that we were here earlier than our reserved time. And, as I prepared to handle the prolonged wait by responding to emails, I was pleasantly surprised that the hostess was already escorting us to our table with nary a delay.  I had previously stated, my trepidation was unwarranted!  They handled our introduction with aplomb. It was important to me for this to go without a hitch, since it was my wife's idea to eat here, and it was my daughter's planning that got us to this point - so far so good.  As we were seated, our server, Patrick, introduced himself and took our drink orders. Patrick is a professional - well mannered, polite, and efficient. And, our initial introduction with him would pave the way for an entirely wonderful experience throughout the evening.  The place was bustling with a plethora of customers within the facility, and we could have experienced table service in a dreadfully dilatory manner, however, Patrick would have none of it. With the assistance of the rest of the wait staff, the hand-offs with the drinks and the meals were well executed.  Speaking of meals, everything we ordered was simply sublime.  My beloved wife had the Roasted Chicken, my beloved daughter had the Korean Style Skirt Steak, and I had the Wood Grilled Pork Chop. I also had the side salad to accompany my meal.  We truly had nothing but great things to say about each and every dinner entree.  My Pork Chop was perfect. Patrick did not neglect to mention that this would be cooked Medium, and he could've not been more spot on in his description. It was perfect.  My wife's Roasted Chicken was so wonderfully and delicately flavored that it was as simply divine within as it was on the outside!  Additionally, my daughter's Skirt Steak tasted as heavenly as it looked.   And speaking of heavenly, this wouldn't be a proper early Mother's Day celebration if we skipped out on dessert. We each ordered a dessert that was appealing to our palates, and absolutely none of us were disappointed in our respective selections.  Between the Chocolate Peanut Butter Molten Cake, Dark Chocolate Cheesecake, and the Warm Croissant Bread Pudding, each provided a delightful wonderment with every bite.  Just as we had opened with Patrick's exemplary service manner, he continued his attentiveness even after our table had already been cleared, the bill had been settled, and all we were doing was simply conversing and discussing my daughter's wedding plans.  I was so glad and relieved that The Henry provided such a superlative first time experience for the rest of my family. Now that they had experienced what I had been raving about all this time, this establishment managed to make even more new friends.  Any previous apprehension on my part to recommend this place, both for lunch and dinner, can now be summarily dismissed.",

    "text": "We came in for a Saturday brunch. Due to it bing summer in AZ, there was no wait for the patio! Not surprisingly, we were the only group sitting outside the entire time, which was nice. It felt like a private brunch! I thought it was weird that they do not have a non-alcoholic drinks menu. When I inquired, the server had to list off all the drink options (numerous unique sodas and coffees). It was hard to listen to all of them. I would have preferred to read the options on a menu. I ordered the cucumber and mint soda and my friend went with the grapefruit soda. Both were awesome; super refreshing and not too sweet. We had just finished a workout class so I wanted to eat something healthy. I order the quinoa burrito, which is suppose to have eggs, black beans, corn, chiles, avocado, pepper jack in it. It probably had four beans and five corn kernels in the whole thing. I couldn't taste any pepper jack or chiles. It was mostly super dense, over cooked eggs and a lot quinoa. I love quinoa and even this was too much for me. I barely ate half of it; it was so bland even covered in salsa. We also ordered the parker house rolls to share, which were tasty but not worth the price (four small roles for $9). Overall, this brunch didn't stand up to the ones I have had at the Henry in the past. Whenever I try to eat a healthier option at a Fox Restaurant, I'm always disappointed with the flavor of the food. Next time, I would definitely stick to my favorite, less healthy options, like the chicken fried chicken or the le pig sandwich!",

The service is great, and the decor of this place is beautiful. It has that modern rustic feel to it. This restaurant is definitely perfect for brunches,  dates or dinner with the girlfriends.  I always start with the white truffle parmesan fries which is delicious. I've had the roasted chicken on their dinner menu which is good, but not amazing. All the salads are pretty good too, so are the cocktails. I am a bigger fan of their brunch menu on the weekends. I absolutely LOVE the spicy sausage scramble. The sausage and the zucchini and everything else they put in it just mixes well together. I took it home because it was a pretty big serving and it still tasted good as a left over.   On the other side of the restaurant is the coffee area. You can't go wrong with their coffee either!",

Went for a morning meeting last Wednesday and was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it was to meet with 6 other individuals about important issues and yet, have the relaxing feeling of enjoying breakfast with coffee and/or juice and not feeling pressured to leave right away. The Vintage Atlantic feel was nice as well. I have been advised to go during dinner. I think I may.",

Soft brioche with bacon, eggs, avocados and spring greens.  This place has a homey feel- that comfortable and open home feel.  Their hosts and servers are beautiful and friendly!  If you come for lunch- the truffle fries are a must. I'm not a French fries person but these fries are crisp with that buttery aftertaste with just the right saltiness.  Try the chopped chicken salad too- oh my!  The creamy goat cheese with quinoa granola, dates, apples, and chopped chicken and kale/spring mix - every bite is savor full!  The Strawberry Mandarin soda is refreshing!  What a great fruit combo!  Love this place!!!",

Everyone we encountered, from our waitress to the bloody mary cart guy, was so nice and accommodating.   I ordered the popovers and the salmon appetizer on hash browns. Share the popovers with other people! All I needed was one but I managed to eat 1.5 :)   My only complaint about brunch was the salmon appetizer was very salty. If they did with a little less added salt I think the meal would have been perfect.",

During Happy Hour, we had a cheeseburger, whipped cheddar dip with ciabatta bread, and short rib tacos. The cheeseburger was really good, the dip was unique, and the tacos weren't that great. The real star of the evening? The fig and ginger mule!  We'll have to give this place another try again. Hopefully service will be better next time.  *Why the service wasn't that great: I ordered a cocktail with my meal and after almost 20 minutes, I had to ask our waiter about it and only then was it brought to our table after an additional 5 minutes or so. We also had originally ordered truffle fries to go along with our meal. Everything else we ordered came along so we started eating and we kept waiting and waiting for the fries. Our waiter was nowhere to be found. I had to actively go and find our waiter to let him know our fries were never brought out and, at this point, to just remove them from the tab and to please bring the check. We noticed every table around us was being serviced regularly throughout their meals but not our table. Chelsea, thank you for reaching out to me about this.",

The cappuccino was good, but there was nothing especially noteworthy about it. The chocolate croissant looked cool because it had brown stripes on the outside of it and was a good croissant.   I really like that there is ample seating here, which is important because it is quite a busy place.  It is a place where you could easily bring some work and hang out for a while.  Overall: This is a good place to do some work or hang out with a friend and the ambiance is hip and inviting, but there are a lot of other coffee places in the area and I'm not convinced that this will be the best coffee around.",

Very approachable menu.  I thought it was going to be a traditional American conventional but some things were actually pretty interesting, such as the short rib potstickers.  I had a beautiful branzino fish and the men had Short Rib and Korean flank steak.  Our cocktails were delicious and ordered different ones to try.  Our dessert was actually a birthday cake that came out with candles.  We had a lovely evening and I will definitely have to come back for brunch or lunch.

    "text": "After an afternoon of house hunting In Paradise Valley and Arcadia we decided to check this place out as all the realtors in the area recommended it. We saw 6 houses and every realtor sent us here so we can get the vibe of the neighborhood.  We came in around 4:30 ish and they were in between menus. As we weren't starved this was a perfect time for us to try an appetizer and split a sandwich. We decided to start with the Kale/truffle dip with pita slices and the flatbread. It was truly delicious and really filling. After nibbling on a few slices we started getting full. The dip came hot and every morsel was delicious. It was literally melt in your mouth stuff. If it was possible I wanted to take an order of this home and just have it as an emergency snack. Yes it was that good.  About 15 minutes later our Turkey sandwich with dipping sauce came out with a nice salad. It was nice they split it in half and plated it for us with no extra cost. The sandwich just hit the spot for our appetites. Even though I didn't use the dipping sauce (came out nice and hot by the way) it was very light tasting. The sandwich was fine the way it was, simple and full of flavor. What was also good was that the side salad that we opted for wasn't heavily coated in salad dressing. It was just nicely done. It too was light tasting. I know I used this word twice in this review but after a day of house hunting, we looked forward to food that didn't drag us down or put us into a carb coma.  The whole experience was great. Nice neighborhood feeling of hipsters, families and retirees, great atmosphere (you can hear yourself talk), decorated beautifully and clean.  I can understand why everyone recommends this place.  Can't wait for our next visit to try something on the dinner menu and to hang out at their coffee shop.",

    "text": "I was here for a business dinner on a Monday night. We had our own private room separate from the rest of the restaurant. There were about thirty of us, two wait staff, and one bus boy. Our tables were a bit close together, so I had our group move the table a bit since we were on the edge to give a bit more room. Much better!  We had a set menu, which included a salad. The salad was okay. I would not have paid for it, but it was your typical carrots, lettuce, croutons, etc. I chose the spare rib and a strawberry shortcake for my main entree and dessert. The spare rib was ok, but the lack of bone was throwing me off. It was pretty tasty though. The rib was also fork tender, which is a must for me with spare ribs. I later asked the waiter about the preparation, and it turns out the spare ribs are cooked sous vide.  The dessert was disappointing. The shortcake \"looked like someone cut out a Pillsbury biscuit and dumped it on the plate,\" to quote a co-worker. The cake itself though was so dense, I only took a couple of bites. It was not light and airy, yet still flaky. I would have preferred more strawberries or some sort of strawberry puree/syrup drizzled over the top.   If I ever returned, I would choose the spare rib, and I would skip the shortcake. Service was great. If anything was needed, the wait staff were accommodating. I would not mind trying another restaurant in the area, but I would not mind returning!",

Everyone had been hyping me up so much about this restaurant, so I was ready and hungry and willing. First thing, made an 815 reservation that they \"did not have in the system\". So we waited for about half an hour before the manager came over to assist. Meanwhile, there just so happen to be no seats at the bar or in the waiting area so we just stood there in the middle of it all.   By the time we got a table, I was ready to leave. But, that all changed with the short rib potstickers. OMG. Top 5 thing I have ever eaten. I ended up getting the roasted chicken (so juicy).   May return; staff won't keep you coming back but those potstickers.......",

    "text": "Honestly the food and coffee deserve more like four stars and the staff definitely deserve five stars but what compels me to give the restaurant only two is the new WiFi policy.   Normally I could buy my coffee and breakfast and settle in to study, grade papers or work for 3-4 hours and even grab some lunch to go when I was done.  Now I am limited to 2 hours by the new WiFi policy.    I was in the middle of a project when I automatically lost connection, which is a total bummer! Lost work means lost time and therefore lost money. I could have waited an hour to reconnect for another two hours but I chose to leave instead.   So, I realize that this may be the point. I usually have a \"work away from the office\" day once a month but there could be people that use this restaurant as an office. It is easy to imagine that the reason for the policy is to pressure people to leave.   I know that nothing lasts forever, but even so, this makes me a little sad! Even though I have been a regular patron for 3+ years and am on a first-name basis with the many of the morning staff, I am inclined to take my business elsewhere. I, for sure, can no longer recommend this as \"the greatest place\" as I have done for years. :(",

Lots of seating, people chatting drinking coffee, laughter filling the space, along with lap tops, glowing in the faces of business people, students, and friends catching up. I wanted to just walk around and explore every nook and cranny of this place! The coffee shop is absolutely wonderful! Friendly barista's, with a great selection of coffees, teas, and smoothies. You can order breakfast up until 10:30am, or you can choose from a mouth watering selection of pastries, from the coffee shop. It's also great for coffee to go. The lunch menu looked great, although I stuck to coffee and Pastries this visit. (Cheese danishes, and apple fritters) they were amazing!  The full service bar, looked so inviting, can't wait to stop back by for a cocktail! The restaurant looked even more inviting! Large comfortable booths, with bustling waiters, attending to customers. As I continued to take this place in, you couldn't help notice, how the staff, knew the \"regulars,\" I LOVE that in a restaurant!   The patio looked great as well! Without a doubt, I'll be one of those \"regulars\" very quickly!",

Other people in the bridal party had skuna bay salmon and harvest bowl who also raved about their dishes. We finished the night with a vegan carrot cake sides with a coconut cream cheese.

The mimosas were so good and strong, not stingy on the alcohol.   Let's talk about the coffee, I am a coffee addict and if I could drink coffee everyday at this place, I would!",

We both sat at a high top by the coffee area and I ordered a beer and we got the kale dip with flatbread appetizer that was really delicious. I got the chicken brunch and she got some vegan salad that looked good despite it's total lack of anything I would eat (lol). The only thing that wasn't great was the service, but even with that being said I would definitely stand behind my 5 star review. It was a busy Sunday for brunch and we were sitting in an area that was kind of away from the main seating area, so that is how I'll chalk the service up. We definitely plan on coming back and eating here again, and I'm sure it won't disappoint!",

Food: 4.75, Service: 3.5, Atmosphere: 5 Cost to worth it rating: 3 (starters ~$15, entrees ~$30) Opentableable: yes, kid's menu: yes Return worthiness: YES! Eve award: best short rib items   Highlights: - Short rib potstickers: perfectly thin but thick enough skin with a crispy bottom and tasty meat filling inside. Ponzu sauce was great too. 5 stars - Short ribs: everything they should be. Meaty, tender, and packed with a rich, just salty enough flavor baked in. Seated on top of a pile of buttery mashed potatoes and some blue cheese chunks sprinkled on the side to take it up a notch then topped with arugula to cut all the fat. I'm picky about my short ribs and this was one of the best I've had. 5 stars. - Rolls: soft and warm loaded with thinly grated cheese, bacon, and creme friache. 4.5 stars - Turkey french dip: my hub is a sucker for the beef version so thought he'd give it a try since it was popular here. The thick turkey was tender and the soft roll and jus made it. 4.5 stars. - Steak: my niece enjoyed her hanger steak: 4 stars  - Bolognese: love how they served it unmixed and with a dollop of ricotta. My neice's boyfriend liked his choice. 4 stars  - Parmesan truffle fries: solid and not too truffly. 4 stars  - Drinks: good cocktail list and retro flat top champagne glasses - Atmosphere: perfect for a nicer dinner out. Upscale but with comfy booths.   Lowlights:  - Peanut butter molten cake: was excited for my fave chocolate and peanut butter dessert combo, but wasn't soft or runny inside like it should be so was a miss. 3 stars   Loved this place and would recommend it to anyone visiting the area.",

There is a separate area for specialty coffee drinks and they also have a small bakery where you can purchase fresh pastries, croissants, banana loaves, and muffins.   There were so many great options for breakfast and they also had a lunch menu, but I tend to stick with the egg items, etc. I ordered the Henry egg sandwich and it was amazing!!! My wife ordered the eggs Benedict which was pretty good too! She also ordered this plum infused vodka Bloody Mary and she loved it!   The Bloody Mary's come from this cool cart that walks around the tables and offers to make fresh Bloody Mary's custom made for the certain individual. It was actually pretty cool, but it doesn't come so often, so be ready to order and know what you want!  Overall the place is great for brunch! The wait is quite long on the weekends so be sure to get their early or be prepared to wait!",

The server must have forgotten about us because we waited longer than usual before even being greeted or getting waters. We ordered the guac and they told us it was on the house! Very unexpected and generous! We ordered our food--got the short rib and the roast beef sandwich. Short rib came out perfectly and was to die for good. They brought out the wrong entree for our second order and had to send it back. It took pretty long for us to get it correct, and sadly by the time it arrived the other meal was gone and we had been sitting for a few minutes just staring st each other. The second meal was okay, but probably not as good because it was rushed being thrown together and was missing the sauce to dip. I didn't bother mentioning it cause we had already waited so long at this point.  They brought us a dessert on the house and apologized and we appreciated it.  I definitely want to give this place another shot cause the ambiance and decor is so fun and the menu has lots of great mouth watering items. Total Instagram worthy restaurant if you know what I'm saying haha",

    "text": "3/13/18 Yelp Review The Henry 4455 E Camelback Rd Phoenix, AZ 85018 (602) 429-8020  Went to The Henry for brunch last weekend with my friends, and I think we had a good time overall. The Henry is a very busy and trendy restaurant and, to be honest, taking good pictures was one of the reasons made me and my friends go there.  Although we waited for half an hour before we finally got the food, the slow service didn't make us mad. First, we didn't make the reservation under the circumstance that we've already knew there would be a lot of people during the weekends. I strongly suggested making a reservation before you go especially during weekend. What's more, they have sofa and chairs outside at the side patio for people to wait. The patio and the wall with their name The Henry on it are good places to take pictures with friends.  We then got our seat and I had to say the ambience was very good. The design of the restaurant and the decorations made it a good choice for family and friends at weekend. Our waiter was friendly and willing to help when we ordered.  We had Smoked Norwegian Salmon and dumpling as appetizer. The dumpling comes with six pieces in delicious sauce which is a perfect appetizer to start a meal. Our slide was French fries which was finished really quick by four of us. The French fries was only $6 and it tasted so good. As a result, we then ordered the second one. We then ordered two Egg White Turkey Omelette, a Spicy Sausage Scramble and a Chicken Fried Chicken from the weekend brunch menu. The coffee there was so good to drink. There were four of us and each of us had different coffee. It came out that all of them were really good to have. For the Egg White Turkey Omelette, there was roasted turkey, smashed avocado, tomato, and swiss cheese in it. Egg White Turkey Omelette is essentially a brunch staple so how could anyone go wrong with it. One of my friends had Chicken Fried Chicken which includes Buttermilk biscuits, country gravy, and sunny side up eggs. Another friend ordered the Spicy Sausage Scramble. There was Chicken sausage, eggs, zucchini, corn, spinach, grilled onion, and havarti in Spicy Sausage Scramble.  It turned out that I will definitely go to The Henry next time and I will try Spicy Sausage Scramble next time because all the other dishes may be a little bland for me. While others may consider no flavor to be the best to have in brunch, I would like to eat something spicy.  The price was not so high for bunch and I think the food deserve this price. Therefore, I give The Henry a five point because I like the food, the coffee, the atmosphere, their service and their price. Although we waited for half an hour, I think the food deserve waiting. Moreover, one of my friends was form Japan and she said she love waiting and actually most of the Japanese love waiting. [504 wds.]",

I had the \"Le pig\" sandwich and that was great but the side of potatoes it came with were not. Which sucked for me because homestyle potatoes are my absolute favorite!! They were just tiny and really hard so not a win win for me. My friends and I were also excited because we were in time for happy hour and that was probably the worst part. I don't think any of us truly enjoyed our drinks. The grapefruit palomita was so strong we had to take sips at a time and even then we were still cringing at the taste. The pomegranate peach mule was no better in my opinion. I couldn't taste any sort of sweetness from the pomegranate or the peach! As for the almost naked margarita well that was probably the best one yet its not even worth talking about. The atmosphere and service are the only reasons I would consider coming back.",

She had this DIY spoon tie clip that she made herself that was very cute.   Shortly after ordering, our prairie breeze cheddar popovers came out. I wished they were a little warmer but overall they were tasty and came with some yummy smoked ham and fleur de sel butter.   Our entrees arrived 55 minutes after we ordered our food. We ordered the ginger glazed black cod and the roasted chicken with rosemary lemon pan jus. We were one of a few tables that inexplicably did not receive our food in a timely manner. We saw restaurant patrons come and go and were very disappointed as the experience started strong and was rapidly deteriorating.   The manager came by and apologized and asked if he could do anything but said the food would be out shortly. In my opinion and based on prior experiences if things aren't going well, the restaurant proactively brings out something to appease the patrons such as a small appetizer to hold them over. We continued to wait and wait and then the waitress came over and apologized. Eventually the food came and the manager said our meal would be comped which definitely helped our irritation.  The entrees were really good and based on the reviews I would imagine this was an off day. If we happened to be in town again we would give this place another shot and hope for a speedier service.",

There are several smaller tables where you can work alone or sit with a small group, and larger ones (some with outlets) to meet with larger groups.   The food is similar to what is served in the restaurant, but the menu is slightly smaller. Everything I have had has been excellent (the scramble and parfait are some of my faves). The only reason why I'm only giving the coffee shop 4 stars is because the drip coffee is kind of weak and weird tasting. Essentially, you have to buy a specialty drink to get something strong and flavorful. Those are great (I love the wildflower), but pretty expensive.  In general, this is a great place with really really good food and a fun atmosphere.",

Truly a delight to all your senses.   I had the harvest quinoa bowl. The amount of flavors and textures was just incredible.

The turkey French dip was not worth the price. The French fries were limp and mushy. The prime steak sandwich was a bunch of beef strips on a bun. The meat was tender but lots of sinew and grisle.  Not a good value. Try wallys across the street. Way better and not a corporate restaurant.",

I would argue that The Henry is their best venture -- the space is unique and the menu is right on par with that.  Also, the test kitchen is an amazing place to eat a meal if you ever get a chance. You're behind the kitchen and you get a semi-private room thats in the middle of the kitchen action -- something i found really intriguing while waiting. That room is where they test all the recipes for their restaurants, according to our server. We were able to snag it on Father's Day with a large group reservation.",

I ordered the chicken fried chicken. I love the way they make this comfort dish because it doesn't give you that \"I pigged out\" feeling. The chicken was tender, not heavily battered. The gravy was light and the biscuits had the right amount of buttery goodness. My husband got the spicy chicken sausage scramble, substituted toast instead of the breakfast potatoes. He enjoyed it. Service was timely, on the expensive side for breakfast but overall a good dining experience.",

Last night we were treated to superior service by Matthew.  It was obvious he enjoyed his job, and made us feel welcome in the restaurant.  He was pleasant, and his tempo of conversation and dinner flow was not contrived or forced, as what we experienced at Lon's at the Hermosa the previous weekend (see review).  Matthew could, and should, give the waitstaff at Lon's a refresher course in hospitality immediately!    As for the \"libations\",  a term that I love and it's hardly used, were very well made.  My husband ordered the Old Fashioned, which was stiff and well mixed.  He commented on the very dense cherry.  I had a Malbec. What stepped up the service level was that Matthew made sure we were happy with our selections, and if not, would have offered us another choice.  Dinner portions were just right, not too much, but not overwhelmingly gigantic, which I find as a way a restaurant compensates for using sub par ingredients in exchange for large portions.  My roasted chicken dinner was simple but tasty.  The brussel sprouts were nicely cooked, maybe a tad too salty.  My husband's bolognese sauce with home made pasta was very good.  Since it was a birthday celebration, we were treated by the house with a dessert of choice.  The bread pudding was delightful, warm and decadent.  The following day my husband commented again how he enjoyed his experience at The Henry, and especially Matthew's attentive skills.  It really soured our experience at Lon's to another level!  We will be back again, and hopefully get to see Matthew again!  We found out he has been a server for a long time, enjoys walking patrons through the menu and proud of the culinary creations and experimentations that The Henry and FRC provides.  He took the time to chat with us, and sharing tidbits of his life, albeit without a tone of rushing through.  To The Henry, please keep up what you're doing.  So far, this is now our favorite of the FRC options!",

There were a lot of items on the breakfast menu I'd like to try - I had the egg white turkey omelette, really good but if you're like me and you're ordering it because it has avocado, ask for extra. There is just a small amount of smashed avocado on top of the omelet.   The patio is really nice - as of last weekend, they didn't have umbrellas out there yet, so dress for the heat if you're sitting outside.   It looks like they have a good happy hour but they only have it available in the bar area - and even when I got there mid-week a little after 5:00, it was already full.  Would definitely recommend making a reservation - this place can get packed.",

Inside the place I felt like I was back in long Island in South Hampton on an episode of Revenge. lol- classy beach style. Except the whole front door, cheesy arrow sign that does not really match the theme. What's up with that? Okay, truth be told I love it anyway.  I chuckled at another reviewer that said he thought he was in a POLO catalog. I can see that, maybe, but not really. Anyway long story short the place is very pretty as everyone else has noted.   The food and service are typical of a Fox restaurant experience. I have never had bad food or service at any Fox restaurant yet. They have a group mentality when it comes to serving so it is always wonderful with everyone helping. Their staff get extensive training on how to serve and it shows. I just do not believe bad reviews for service. I know stuff happens but I have eaten at Fox restaurants many, many times and it is always the same. All staff  members help at all tables. Their training is superb compared to other food places.   For food we had the Popovers. The verdict is still out for me on the ham flavored butter. I like ham but I am not sure why this product exists. lol The waiter said Vegans like it. I did not dislike it per say I just thought it was weird. I am sure it was a taste thing. I can see the comparison. It tasted like ham but not. To me it had a smoky/gamey flavoring and I do not like that. I had the herb butter as a backup but my friend loved the ham butter. It all worked out okay. We also split a chopped salad, which was good.   Since it was my birthday I was sent a mailing list coupon for a free desert. I got the bread pudding. it was so amazing!  My friend loved their new peanut butter dessert  bar. The drinks are fun here too. My Passion fruit drink was too tart for my tastes but I went with it and it was still \"Delish.\" My friend got the Berry Lemonade which was great! I need to come back to try other entrees and sandwiches. The burger at the next table looked pretty good. ( insert drool marks)   On the way out we noticed the patio, which is gorgeous. When it is cooler a patio date is in my future at the Henry. They should also consider hosting special events out there since it is so pretty.",

Service was so great - I forget her name, but she was so nice, really knowledgeable and made great recommendation.   Would definitely go here the next time I'm in the area!",

I was confused at first how it worked, but in the morning I learned you walk up to the register, order, and they give you a number and serve you at your table. In the afternoon and evening, you are seated and served as a regular restaurant. Hope this helps! I'm looking forward to going back again soon!",

For a year my husband picked up a yogurt parfait from The Henry after a Village workout, and loved it. Then suddenly the fruit content was cut in half. He said something a couple of times and they fixed it, but he got tired of it. So he stopped going for a while. Now for the past 6 mos he's been going again, and  ordering a side of bacon. It's always been 4 whole strips of bacon...this morning he got 4 half strips of bacon...so 2 whole strips...and they were super fatty. He commented they're cutting costs again by buying cheaper bacon and suddenly cutting the amount in half. Either really bad QC or cost cutting. Again.",

    "text": "Sam Fox does it again! I'm so behind on checking the rest of the newish FRC spots in the Phoenix area, but alas, I made it to The Henry. It's Sam Fox in every way- they've nailed ambiance, service and a solid menu. It appears this restaurant shared the building with their HQ, it's pretty cool! I loved the vintage yet contemporary setting. My group of three managed to get seated right away on a Tuesday night, but it was also like 8:45pm. The place was still bustling with diners. I stuck to wine even though the cocktail and whiskey list did impress. We shared the avocado toast to start. It was fresh and light and could easily be made at home. I'd probably order something a little more indulgent next time. I must've been in a healthy mood, because I ordered the Mediterranean fatoosh salad with chicken. This item was not particularly impressive for an entree salad, there was barely a hint of Sumac in the dressing. Those looking for an extremely lightly flavored or garnished salad might enjoy this. It was A-Ok. Next time, I'll go for a main entree for dinner. My dining buddies devoured their dinner- the roasted chicken and a pasta dish. Luckily, they were happy to let me in on their entrees! I'd go for the roasted chicken for sure, served with mashed potatoes and a side salad, this dish is comforting and filling. Overall, The Henry is fun and fresh and the service was stellar.",

Food was above average, service was above average and the cocktails stood out for sure (their version of a Moscow Mule is delish!)   There were 5 in our group, and we all ordered various meat entrees (I can't speak for the apps myself but my friends were all ohh-ing and ahh-ing over the cheese popovers, Swedish meatball, & chicken and the egg. I am on a stupid diet that doesn't allow any of that fun stuff).  I had the porkchop with cauliflower polenta and chard.  I was surprised by the size of the entree and how perfectly it was cooked.  I ate every last bite and tried the short rib as well which I probably would have ordered if I did it over again.  Maybe next time.   The menu seems to be more varied and extensive than other FRCs I've been to, which is nice.  I would love to go back for brunch!",

    "text": "Where do I begin?????  Well enjoyed being seated only to wait about 5 mins before the server (he didn't say his name) came over to ask if we wanted something to drink.  Mentions there was a coffee bar and pointed over the area so did he want us to get our own coffee?  Seemed implied.  Ok 2 of my friends order coffee drinks and another ordered green tea and I got water.  I was really excited about the build your own bloody mary cart that I kept hearing about.  Only for him to explain it's not ready yet and will be in about 30 mins.  Ok that makes it 930am great. My friend then had to ask him to bring 2 waters for our friends who weren't there yet, ummm shouldn't he has just known to do that without having to be told?  Okay so friends get there and ask to be on their own tab (makes it so easy before ordering everything) they ask for an iced tea and diet coke.  Super simple right, well at this point horrible server tells us the bloody mary cart isn't going to be ready for another 45 mins, so clearly you don't know what time your restaurant runs things and you're the server.  Ok breakfast would be over by then so my diet coke friend and myself said never mind.  He then pipes up and says I can still get you one from the bar.  No thanks that whole point is to pick your items for your BM, so I get an iced coffee. We order some popovers that were ok, not great just ok.  So now it's been about 10 mins no iced tea, diet coke or my iced coffee I ask the server about our drinks \"oh yay\"  I'll bring them right out, AKA I forgot to order them.  Again my friend reminds we they are on their own tab, everyone orders a table of 6, I have to ask another server for a water refill because our waiting just didn't get the empty glasses at the end of the table meaning need more water,  since we still didn't have our other drinks, he comes over and fills the glasses I'm assuming because she told him.  Now it's only 9 something am on a Sunday so not crazy busy I would say.  Great finally get drinks but again he walks away without asking my friend with green iced tea if he would like a refill.  I sorry but your choose to be a server then you need to be better at serving people and be aware of what your tables need.  So of course he had to ask for a refill still no food, about 35 mins later we get our food, great except my friend in the our own tabs didn't get his order and I asked for gravy on the side ( i didn't dare say something with how long it took to get here the first time).  Seriously, it's that hard to write orders down and put into a computer to order????? Especially because the other tables he had were empty at this point.  So he says about 10 more mins for my friends food, so awkward a table of 6 and 1 whole meal is missing, wow.  I assume the manager came over within 2 mins and brought his food apologized and brought him a yogurt parfait for having to wait.  Wow if the server could only take lessons from his manager.  Ok it's now 1015 it took that long to get breakfast in a not overly crowded restaurant.  We get our checks and mine was $18 and change I give a $20 and he smartly says do you want your change, No I said, really at this point you continue to be stupid.  So he brings everyone their cards back and bring me my bill and $1.  Seriously, this guy is  out of control, I said no, yet you bring me just a dollar back, not even the entire change.  Now you get the change and $1 for your tip.  I always feel bad for servers since they live for tips and give at least 20% but I have never experienced such horrible service like this.  Especially from the Fox restaurants.  Makes me  wonder if the other restaurant servers have gone down hill as well.  WON'T BE RETURNING HERE AGAIN!  Would give zero stars if possible.",

I ordered the kale dip appetizer. I should have listened to the bartenders suggestion and gotten the burger instead.  The kale dip was strange.  Tiny pieces of Kale (blended I assume) with some milky cheesy substance that reminded me of cream of mushroom soup. It had a sweetness to it I couldn't place as a specific spice. The pita bread it came with was soggy on the end so that combined with the cream of mushroom type dip was sort of... Gross. It didn't even have a dip consistency but rather was like a thick soup. Double gross.   The bartender upon hearing my unenthusiastic response to the dish offered to get me something that wowed me which I appreciated but nothing else looked good to me at that point.   I guess I ordered the wrong thing.  Oh yes I almost forgot. No one acknowledged us when we sat near the couch. We got our own drinks from the bar. But later we realized the people next to us were being served drinks and we had been overlooked. So that was huge gap in service since we sat for a good ten minutes before getting our own drinks.  The coffee bar looked inviting. That said there were definitely people around that looked and acted rather snobby. Luckily they were balanced out by others who seemed down to earth and friendly who were enjoying meals.  Parking was tight.  Not sure if I would come back.  The menu had some pricey items that I hope would be more impressive than the Kale dip.",

Such is what I found at Henry last Sunday.  5pm reservation and didn't leave til 715pm - the place filled up after we arrived but we sat in a pretty empty place for the first 20 minutes - 35 mins on a kids meal - they our food comes and my ribs were like strings of fat attached to bone.  The replacement sandwich (corned beef) was very good but it was almost 3 hours into being there when that came and by then I was just over it.  No manager visit no apologies just a check.  Won't go back.",

Good combination with the arugula.   The bread pudding was warm and served in a hot bowl with some cinnamon ice cream to balance the sweet bread pudding.",

The fish fillet was microscopic!! Really disappointed in all - give this place a pass - over hyped and overpriced!",

The service was good, though our server was a little new it seemed, making a few minor mistakes here and there.   We tried the guacamole and the truffle fries to start. I also had the ahi poke bowl which had very well seasoned shiitake mushrooms that I just could not get enough of. To top it all off, we tried a few desserts to share, but the yogurt panna cotta was by far my favorite and the perfect, lighter dessert to end the night.   The Henry is definitely a great option for a business dinner, since there are various options for different diets and the tables are large and spacious so you can carry on a conversation easily.",

They completely saved the day and went the extra mile today when the restaurant (Rokerij) our friends had booked weeks ago to share their wedding vows with 16 friends dropped the ball and overbooked the room.  As guests were arriving at the restaurant that blew it, a quick call from the Bride put The Henry staff in motion.  This team of professionals pulled together  the  picture perfect venue  and saved the day.  What could have been a complete disaster for this terrific couple was transformed into one of the loveliest wedding events I have ever had the honor to attend.  The service (including the Bloody Mary cart with all the fixings) was spot on and the food was both beautiful as well as tasty.  Perfectly plated, seasoned and cooked, all 18 wedding attendees will remember these gracious hosts and be loyal customers for life!!",

Amazing atmosphere and decoration.   The food and drinks were also delicious, love the cod! The menu was special NYE, so maybe more limited or different from regular menu. We stayed here for hours (first for drinks then for food), it was also big enough that it was not too loud for conversation.   The service was also excellent--at first I thought sitting at the cafe-side (not the major dinner area nor bar) we would get neglected as many restaurants tend to. But our servers were very attentive and walked by frequently. The restaurant wasn't entirely full (at least the cafe-lounge side?) the whole night, so highly recommended!",

    "text": "I meant to write this a few days ago but such as life during this time of year the days get past me.    I had just got off a flight that had been delayed from the craziness from Atlanta's hub which had me stuck for 8 hours (which in itself is ridiculous) so needless to say when I finally landed back in Phoenix I was exhausted and just wanted to eat and go home.    The Henry is directly down the street from home and always a great \"go to\" for consistency in every regard. I haven't been here in a bit but when I do I try and ask for Estefy (do so if you have a chance) not only does she recite the menu beautifully she genuinely cares about the individual she serves, without being \"fake\" or \"forceful\" on what would seem to be an upsell to most people.    Again, I was tired but when we began with the short rib potstickers with yuzu ponzu the rest was down hill. My guest and I then split the gem brussel sprout Caesar salad followed by the salmon and pork loin. Both the lemon beet glaze and sage stuffing accompanying these dishes were everything Estefy said they would be.    We couldn't do dessert but felt we already demolished them after she described the Pear Cake with the honey crema and pear sorbet ?? Mind blown....without the calories :)   Thank you again FRC for your attention to detail with ambiance and food quality. And thank you Estefy for the recommendation on what I just described and directing me to the 'Wake of Angels'.   Hendricks is my weakness when I've had a real shit day and although nothing could have made that particular day go ANYMORE wrong. It all was forgotten over the evening.   See you guys soon.",

No bones, grilled, and brushed with butter. I had kale cole slaw and grilled asparagus. All perfectly prepared...all very filling.   The Waiter was also delightful... Loved his job, knew the menu like the back of his hand. Entertaining.   Excellent wine list as well.   So in honor of Hammering Hank from Atlanta ...  Do me a favor...Go!",

Not even to look back to realize I was stuck at set of stairs going up to the patio. Numerous patrons eating asked if I needed help with the stroller but the person showing me to the table could care less.   Next came the service for food. Forgotten order then the guy looked completely miserable.   Gotta say, all the great food was ruined by the terrible service attitude. Food 4-5 stars . Service 1 star.",

    "text": "This is an interesting place.   We dined here on a Saturday evening while traveling to Phoenix.  When we pulled into the parking lot,  it was full of 30 and 40 year old people, some with children,  and it seemed lively and upbeat.   This impression carried over when we entered, there were lots of people having a good time, and the restaurant was full.    We were seated quickly at a small table,  there was a banquette for my wife, and I had a chair facing the wsll, which eliminated my ability to enjoy the restaurant's pleasant and upbeat  ambience.   The waitress was helpful and friendly.  The food was tasty and presented quickly.  If you're keeping track of such things it was about half again as expensive as it should have been.  Now, the pacing of a dinner is important. No one wants to sit for an hour or two just waiting for dinner to arrive.  Here, the opposite is True. We were seated at 7:10, and at 7:40 we were walking out the door.   As I said, the food was tasty,  portions a trifle small, but the best thing about this place is the ambiance and the people watching,  and there was just no time to do that. Depending on your seating placement some in your party may miss a lot of it anyway.   Maybe I will return if I am back in town some time in the future.",

We sat at the bar where we proceeded to have the worst bartender of our life attempt to serve us in a non representable manner for their well-known concept chain of hospitality. I've eaten here before and never had a problem, but this time I will never come back due to the bad taste in our mouths after our short dining experience.   The bartender spent 5-10 minutes in between us tasting a sample of wine to find the right one to come back and ask us if we wanted to order the specific Blend of Pinot. I was frustrated. We were the only people at the bar besides a server eating dinner next to me at the bar.   I don't even want to get into the whole scenario but long story short, when we left she got a 20% tip instead of my boyfriends normal 30% and she promised to \"make it up to us next time\".... Honey, there won't be a next time.   That is not how he runs his restaurants. You fix it while the guest is still there so they leave happy!!",

I ordered a salad that had chicken and pistachios in it. I took my first bite and almost broke a tooth. I bit down on a piece of hard shell. I did let our waiter know and he proceeded to inform me that that has never happened before. I suggested that he let the kitchen know so it does not happen again and someone else breaks a tooth. I finished my salad carefully.  The food is decent, although a bit over priced.",

We were disappointed that 3 items out of the advertised restaurant week menu was no longer available as early as 8:30pm. No more crab cakes, no more pudding and choco lava cake.They made an effort to add yogurt panna cotta, but it was not good. Same thing for the strawberry cake, cake was dry drizzled with syrup that was very sweet then topped with maybe 3 strawberry slices.  Table next to us didn't even finish half of the choco lava cake,  which made me wonder if it was any good.",

A cute coffee bar is set up inside in between the dining and \"study\" area.  This place is designed in such a classy way that it makes you want to dress up classy and dine here breakfast, brunch, and lunch, and dinner.  But it's a great place to meet up with family and friends.  A bar and TVs are also available! I have tried the Wildflower (vanilla, espresso, steamed milk with a splash of chai) and the Cleo (almond milk, hazelnut, espresso).  Both are great nontraditional coffees to taste.   The Flower Child Scramble (snap pea, asparagus, kale, roasted mushroom, parmesean - $11)  is a great combination for something non-meaty.  This had a great mix of flavorful vegetables. Chicken Fried Chicken (buttermilk biscuits, fried egg and gravy - $13) - I don't think you can go wrong with something so darn good. I really love the Quinoa Breakfast Burrito (organic eggs, black bean, roasted corn, chile, avocado, pepper jack - $10).  All these ingredients....what's not to love!  It comes with cuts of potatoes!  This dish is light yet flavorful!    Ending it with a dessert - the Warm Croissant Bread Pudding (toasted pecans, caramel ice cream, whiskey raisins - $7).  I love the creative twist on this bread pudding.  That buttery taste of croissant bread mixed in with sweetness and crunch of the pecans made it so yummmm!  Share it!",

Whether you sit inside, outside, bar or at  the large coffee table it is a nice relaxing atmosphere.    We went there for breakfast and chose the bar for the TV {football Sunday}.  **Weekend Note - Arrive before 10am - NO waiting**  Le Pig $11.00: scrambled eggs, ham, havarti cheese & mayonnaise on a toasted croissant.  Review - AMAZING. Perfect portion and havarti cheese is a nice addition to a traditional sandwich and truly didn't need the mayo and was glad to have requested it on the side.   Caramel Apple French Toast $10: brown butter cinnamon apple & maple syrup. Review - Okay. It is a thinner bread and not filling. We did have to send it back the first time because it was cold. However, the manager quickly came over to apologize and she removed it from the bill.    Iced Vanilla Latte:  One of the best latte's I have had in town ...   Thanks Sam for another gem in Arcadia, we will be back!",

    "text": "I will start off by saying I LOVE Fox restaurants! I've only been here less than 2 years but have been to The Yard, Arrogant Butcher, Culinary Dropout, North several times each and have always had a great experience bar none everytime. Then I went to The Henry.  We live only 5 mins away and had twice  tried to stop by for dinner on a weekend with no res. Not possible, unless you want to wait an hour for a table. We have a friend visiting from Canada and she wanted to take us out for a nice dinner as a thank you for the hospitality so I suggested we book a table at Fox's Flagship place, their offices being located upstairs. Booked in for 730pm on Tues night. Got there at 725pm and our table was waiting for us. Awesome! But then I tried to say how awesome it was out loud to my wife and our guest, but realized the only way for them to hear me was for me to practically SCREAM! The Henry is LOUD!!! People loud, kitchen loud, music loud, everything loud! And this was a Tuesday! So there we were kinda half shouting to each other. The server comes over right away. Now I'm not sure how to describe his service but will try. This guy was really animated and talked fast (Also having to kinda yell) and was really friendly, but the whole thing seemed like an act. Everything he said sounded scripted, like the way the daily specials sound but everything was like that. Also it seemed that he was either high on something speedy, or was really in the weeds (frantically busy for you non restaurant peeps) and was trying to put on a friendly demeanor. Our guest  noticed that any questions she had were answered indirectly and long-winded the way politicians will answer stuff. At one point as she tried to order a bottle of wine, he starts going on about \"Well why don't I let you look at the wine list for a few more minutes and I will come back... \"I'm trying to order the wine now.\" says our guest. Awkward moment follows for 2 secs. You get the idea. I had ordered a can of beer, which arrived promptly. The wine however took about 10min to land, so I had to sit there staring at my glass of beer untouched for the duration as anyone with any decorum knows how gauche it is to sip an alcoholic drink before everyone at the table has a drink in front of them to cheers.  The menu is interesting, though there isn't a whole lot on there. We split the grilled artichokes which were fine. Same as they are at The Yard. Not amazing but hey, there's no reinventing that dish.  I had the chicken with kale slaw and mac and cheese. Very well presented and all three delicious. My wife and Guest each wanted two pastas, the mushroom tortelli and the bacon parm gemelli. They asked Server Sketchy if the kitchen could simply split both and plate  two different half orders of  pasta on each plate. He says sure thing. The food arrives and the pastas are not split at all. Then when asked why they weren't split, he says\" Oh, sure thing be right back!\" He comes back with 2 side plates and plops them down. \"We'll need some kind of spoon to divy this up.\" Says my exasperated wife. Off he goes to get a spoon. Then there's the awkward 30 secs of struggling to split the food onto two plates, which totally ruins the foods' presentation. Having a chef do it makes it neat and pretty. Do it yourself makes it look like a dog's breakfast. I should have complained to a manager. I worked in service for 20 years and the right thing to do was to apologize for the mix up, take the plates back to the kitchen and have a cook split and re-plate the food in an attractive manner the way it was requested. We're not trying to divide up Moons over My Hammy at Denny's! The pastas did however taste great, though Guest thought the gemelli was too salty. \"It's bacon and Parmesan cheese\" said I, \"Two of the the saltiest foods around which is why they are awesome!\" She's a person who never uses salt on anything. My wife thought it was fine. The last thing that really clinched this as a mediocre Fox experience was that around 945pm our server started sweeping under the tables in his (our) section. I mean I have done endless side-duties in my career in the biz and I understand wanting to get the hell outta Dodge asap after a long shift, but at/around table duties should ALWAYS wait until every customer in that section is gone. Period. We were going to order some dessert, but as we were obviously over-staying our welcome in this guys' section we just asked for the tab.  All in all, this was my first and last visit to The Henry. Fox has so many other great places that I really enjoy, there is no need for me to bother. I will say though that as this is their head office location, management needs to tighten the screws on how to provide the great service and dining experience we all have come to expect from a Fox restaurant. You have set the bar high. Maintain it. I will likely ease my disappointment later this afternoon at North's awesome happy hour.",

The menu was more limited than what I was expecting but the food was good. More of a trendy place to go with friends rather than a food destination.",

Several of us ordered a Bloody Mary, which was divine! The Bloody Mary prep guy could have had more personality and generally been more friendly (because seriously, what a cool job to have), but oh well.  We ordered several different things off the menu and everything was tasty. The atmosphere was very lively and fun. Some people were dressed in workout clothes and casual, and some were fancied up a bit. Diverse crowd, which was nice.  All in all, my only wish is that they had more gluten free options, but regardless I will for sure be back.",

Hubby had the fig and pomegranate(?) mule. It was amazing. Wish I had one for myself too. Others at the table enjoyed delicious cocktails as well. No complaints.   At first glance the menu is not overly impressive but at the recommendation of my server I tried the braised short ribs and my husband had the Mediterranean Branzino (Seabass). My oh my was it good! The short ribs had a delicious brandy caramel sauce that was just the right touch for such a dish. The flavors were delicious. I was surprised that my husband had ordered fish since he's a red meat lover but his fish was cooked perfectly and full of delicious flavors. Both dinners were a hit.   Since we don't live close, we probably won't be back that often. However, you can bet we'll stop by when we're in the area and recommend to plenty of people.",

The restaurant also is very cute with a great atmosphere. It is a little fancy in a way I'm not sure if I like. The service and food for the restaurant were ok, not amazing. I had the apple French Toast, which was good but needed something else, maybe whipped cream. We even asked and they said they don't have any whipped cream in the kitchen (?). Don't they serve hot chocolate? Or don't they cook with cream? You just whip it. Anyway, the kids' breakfast was done well and was a good value, and the servers were nice to the kids which is always a plus. I will definitely want to try this place for dinner. So far, like it, but not terribly impressed.",

    "text": "Absolutely gorgeous interior with a Southern plantation feel. I love a menu that accommodates foodie adventurers and more conservative eaters. Seafood options, ridiculously delicious looking burgers that are practical to eat (not so big around that a normal sized person can't bite into it), and decent salad options for someone trying to eat relatively light.  That being said- anyone who goes to The Henry and doesn't get the truffle oil fries is missing the boat. I'm actually dreaming about them as I write this.  For the folks who prefer to drink their calories, no shortage of options here either. Great cocktail menu, wide selection of carefully chosen beers and a wide selection of wines. This place is the perfect happy hour spot. BONUS- the interior is acoustically pleasing as well. No straining to hear the person across the table from you. It was so inviting for conversation that we actually met and shared an appetizer with the two wonderfully witty gentlemen that sat down next to us. NICE!",

    "text": "The ambiance of the restaurant does not disappoint.  It's refreshing to see this type of restaurant aesthetic coming in.  Fox got the concept right...but lacks a bit in overall execution.  My wife and I came in for dinner...albeit without reservations...but seriously this is Phoenix.  Spago takes me without a reservation...and seats me in a table I can actually eat at.  I repeatedly told the hostess the table would be too small for us.  When I try a restaurant...I sample...a lot.  The two person tables are for people drinking wine and children.  I am rating this one star lower for just the terribly ridiculous carnival act that had to be performed in order for us to actually eat...uncomfortably.  We tried the short rib potstickers, grilled & chilled charred shrimp, popovers & smoked salmon appetizers.  The popovers are what most places deliver for free...I'm not saying they are not worth $7...I just find it embarrassing that you would charge for them.  The potstickers were okay.  The chilled charred shrimp were a hit and miss.  Beautiful and prabably would have been excellent if served hot.  Serving them cold for \"speciality\" will be lost on anyone that actually FINE dines.  The smoked salmon was good...nothing special...but good.  We ordered the $50 New York steak and the chicken.  I detest overpaying for lower priced cuts of meat...absent from the menu was filet or ribeye etc.  The steak was beautifully prepared, expertly seasoned, and quite delicious.  But fox has literally created this entire menu for shameless profit...and they are either counting on people being completely ignorant,   one hit tourist visitors, or those desperate to cling to anything remotely decent in the way of Phoenix eateries.  We took a few desserts to go...which were delicious.  Including a delectable bread pudding.  I really wanted to like this place...but this is not a fine dining establishment.  It's a cookie cutter fox development wrapped to look like something out of a larger city.  The staff are basically all children, and asking anything beyond the scripted responses they were so obviously drilled on resulted in the \"deer in headlights\" stare.  For instance the server will immediately volunteer \"her favorite\" menu items...if I wanted to know...I would ask...but thank you for the upsell.  I really don't need coaxing to spend money especially from someone that needs to work all day to afford the steak.  I can't really see wanting to go back...there is no depth to this place.  No specials or off the menu items...and a quite boring menu.  I'm not saying this place couldn't be something...it's just not.",

My favorite meal is the Braised Short Rib that has bourbon caramel, roasted mushrooms, fourme dambert & smashed potatoes!!! I'm telling you ...you have to go.

    "text": "I went to The Henry with a group of coworkers for Happy Hour on a Friday after work. We have been going to a new place each month trying to find great places in the neighborhood of Arcadia around our office. Our first mistake was that they do not have a happy hour. No special pricing or menu. The second mistake was not to make a reservation. They were swamped which tends to mean the restaurant is great but they do not leave any room for people to walk in. The wait was 3 hours for a table or you can try to find a seat at the bar if you can push through the swarms of divorcees taking it up.   We then opted to sit down on their patio not knowing what was to come. It was a nice night out and they have a gorgeous patio with a fireplace, heaters, big comfortable wicker chairs and a variety of sized tables. However we found out quickly that they DO NOT serve anything on their patio. No one will take a drink or food order on the patio. You have to walk inside and push your way through to the bar. And even then they WILL NOT deliver food to the patio. Not even appetizers. For some reason they cannot be bothered to walk a few extra feet to deliver food outside. We even offered to pay upfront at the bar for all of the food and they said no.   To top of this experience, when a coworker of mine said to me \"that's ridiculous that we can't even pay for appetizers inside to be delivered to the patio to eat while we wait for a table\"  a staff member at The Henry overheard him and replied \"really.... that's ridiculous\" and then rolled his eyes at us. Having worked in the service industry for years I could not believe someone would be so rude to us especially when we had a table of 10. Needless to say we finished our drinks (which were good but expensive) and left. We took our business to Cornish Pasty Co in old town Scottsdale which was fabulous! I don't think anyone in our party will be back to The Henry any time soon!",

    "text": "Just returned from a shockingly mediocre dinner.  Am really angry to go to a restaurant that used to enjoy a great reputation, and now has me rethinking of ever returning.  I ordered the Poke, and it did not resemble any Poke that I have ever had.  Yes, the Ahi was fresh, but it was just slices of ahi tuna with sticky rice and Ponzu sauce.... Not what I anticipated.  My husband ordered a hamburger and told the server that if it doesn't come out medium rare, it will go back.  It went back 3 times.  If you can't properly cook a burger, then don't offer it.  I can make a burger perfectly at home, why can't they?  That chef should return to cooking class 101 or take a lesson in BBQ to learn the tools that are available to make a simple burger.  The fries came out warm and soggy, not hot and crisp like we requested. We order truffle fries and they came out as plain fries.  The darling, and lovely manager was mortified by what happened, and she picked up a great part of our tab, but that is not the point.   We went out for a simple dinner with friends, and got plain aggravation.  The restaurant was not busy like it used to be, so maybe this isn't an isolated incident.  Our friends ordered a pasta dish that was luke warm and a salad.  Service was not anything to brag about.  The manager, as I mentioned before, was the most professional.  She apologized numerous times, and Ajira should be commended for her diligence in trying to right a very wrong evening. She tried.  The molten chocolate/peanut better dessert was the best thing that came to the table tonite, compliments of Ajira ( I hope the spelling is close)!",
