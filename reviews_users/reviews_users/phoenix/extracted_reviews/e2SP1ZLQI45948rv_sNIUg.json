    "text": "Can't rate the food here as the service or lack of service forced us to leave. Apparently going on a non weekend day and not being a regular impacts your ability to be served. Also I apparently did a big no no by bringing in the last of my iced Starbucks (sorry my bad), and because I ordered water (fyi I don't drink coffee), my starbucks was an iced chai. But instead of advising me I couldn't bring my drink in (which I would have been fine with) they stand behind our booth and talk about me, my starbucks and my water request.  BTW, I finished my chai within 3 mins of entering. We waited 15 more minutes for someone to come and take our order (never happened). Wow immature much, thanks but no thanks. We left and went to BLD.",

This place is medium in size, but offers patios seating which is enjoyable with lots of shade from the overhanging building. I recommend this place if you love breakfast and brunch!",

And the prices have gone up! We have eaten here several times a year for the about the past five years.  It has never been great, but it was always decent.....until now. There were four of us.  We went for breakfast (although I ordered off of the lunch menu) and none of us were pleased with our food.  All three of the others ordered some form of pancake meal and they all said that the pancakes tasted old and that they were rubbery.  My wife's eggs were not cooked as ordered (she ordered over medium).  They were overcooked.  One of the bacon orders was undercooked and one of the others was burned.  I ordered a patty melt (I didn't feel like paying $8.50 for one biscuit with gravy!).  My patty melt   was way overcooked (very dry), the bread was almost burned and the fries were obviously frozen and they weren't even warm. The service was good.  There were probably twenty servers on duty (mostly teenagers), so that was not an issue.  I did try to find a manager, but they couldn't seem to locate anyone in charge.",

The last two times we were there the food left much to be desired.  I usually order the Joe's scramble, and the first time around it came out lukewarm, the bacon was not cooked properly and it just didn't taste good.  I figured it was a fluke or maybe the normal cook was sick or something.  We went last weekend and I ordered a biscuits omelete and my food was cold.  The only good on the plate was the toast, which was not toasted but heated, and the jam.    Again, they were not busy.   The bus boy checked on us more than our waiter Jeremy.  I was extremely disappointed in the food and service.  On check-out, I asked the hostess how we would check to see what our rewards balance was as I wanted to see if we could apply to our bill, and she looked at me and said \"I have no idea\".  We won't be back.",

While I get that the employees probably want to get out of work as quickly as I do when it's time to leave work, in a restaurant I expect to get the same experience near closing time as the person who came at opening time.  The iced tea containers were being emptied and if we had wanted to sit on the patio under the umbrellas -- forget it -- the umbrellas were taken down and by the time we got our food we had watched an employee run a cable through all of the tables and chairs and lock them up tight.  The food was just okay, and rather pricey I thought.  I can go to the diner down the street and get far more food for half the price.  My Hollandaise sauce was rather lumpy, and the red potatoes \"with great seasoning\" were nothing special.",

Maybe me think is there a bird on my head and you're not telling me...BUT the food was good especially the biscuits!!!",

This is the worst service I have ever received here when the server was at the table she was rude and short with me.

Food portions are very large so be warned, you don't really need sides and add-ons, don't worry, you'll be full.    Servers are polite and cheerful, it's sort of server by committee rather than one committed server but they do a good job of making the rounds and making sure you have all you need.  The chicken fried steak is my favorite and pretty much everything else I've tried is very good, in all fairness though I never tried any lunch items, but I feel this is more of a breakfast place anyways, it's not as crazy crowded as other places get on weekends.  There will be a wait, but not an insane one.  Only knock on the place is the coffee, it's not bad...but its not good either.  But everything else is pretty damn good for a strip mall diner.",

But to those who know about it and those hungry enough to check it out are rewarded with large portions and good service.  On a sunny Friday morning, the wife and I were looking for a place to have breakfast while visiting friends in the Chandler/Tempe Area. A quick Yelp search uncovered this little place nearby and decided to give it a try. The cafe is small enough to miss, but does have outdoor seating if needed and a decent sized dining room.   The prices are fair and not over the top, with both breakfast and lunch offerings ranging in the 7-11 dollar range. For the amount of food that you receive, I'd say that it's a good deal. I had the meat lover's breakfast with pancakes and she had the corned beef hash with biscuits. The food was good, but nothing overly astonishing. The corned beef hash was obviously home made, which did make it special, but the meat to potato ratio seemed to be a bit meat heavy (which to some, wouldn't be a bad thing).  The service we received was attentive, and friendly, although a little sparse, having to flag down our server more than once to get some beverage refills. A manager also visited our table to see how we were doing.  Overall, it's a nice little place to have breakfast. The prices are decent and the atmosphere is great for what it is. Food is good, but average.",

There are tables outside on what would be considered a patio, but it isn't really a patio as much as it is the front of the building. So when you're eating outside, everyone who is waiting for a table is in the same area as you and gets to watch you as you eat. Our server only dealt with us when she took our food order and dropped off the check. Someone else brought our drinks, food, and to -go boxes. My boyfriends french toast was dry and my eggs were ice cold. Luckily my pumpkin pancakes were excellent.  We could have sent them back, but it took us over 20 minutes to get our food and we never could find our server, so we just ate what we had. Pretty sure it isn't worth visiting again.",

Was happy with BC's portions and more modest use of sugar in their sweet items. Service was friendly and quick. Got the \"eggs your way\" combo and was plenty for next day leftovers. Taste overall was average. Ham steak a bit dry and same with eggs. Husband's chicken fried steak came out piping hot which was a plus. Overall avg. but for the value (portion:quality:price) may be back when I'm in the mood for breakfast outing.",

The order then took about 45 min. to arrive.  Very understaffed.  When we asked the server if they were short staffed (thinking this was the reason for the poor service) we were told  \"O,  No !\"  Of course not.  No auto coffee refills, or water.  Others who ordered after us were served before us.   At one point the server asked us how everything was -- didn't even look at the table to see we had no food.  Finally after complaining (and asking for a second cup of coffee)  she gave some excuse about not putting the order in the right place.  Been there a number of times, but I will not be back as there are lots of other places you can go in the area.",

I had the chipped beef w/2 eggs over easy, crispy hashbrown and two biscuits. I had decided to go outside of my box with this order. When it arrived my eggs were over cooked as my yolk wasn't runny at all and that is my favorite part. I was expecting some gravy over the chipped beef as it was a tad dry without it so I asked for a side of that which definitely helped. The hashbrowns were cooked crispy like I like but the best part of my breakfast was the two biscuits that I put gravy on one and the jam on the other. My boyfriend ordered the waffles with sausage links. He said it was good but I could tell it didn't stand out like other places. Service was very good but I think we will try other options around the valley before really coming back.",

    "text": "It was a little below average for me. If the name of your restaurant is biscuits, you better serve some pretty darn good biscuits, and they were not that good.   We chose to sit outside on a beautiful October morning and were seated right away. I had my infant with me, but they had no sling for his carrier (and apparently their high chairs do not convert to accommodate a carrier either). Therefore, my 3 month old had to sit in his carrier on the ground while I ate; I watched him like a hawk because there were ants close by. Not a good start.  My girlfriend had been here before and said the food was delicious (she doesn't have a good track record for recommending restaurants). I ordered one biscuit and gravy off the a la carte menu. The waiter said it came with 2 sides??? What? It's a la carte; I don't want a whole meal!?!  Obliging, I picked links and red potatoes, again the red potatoes were raved about by my friend. I'm going to stop taking her suggestions. My plate came out and 3/4 of it was covered by lukewarm red potatoes. Actually, my whole plate was lukewarm; very disappointing. The biscuit had a weird spongy texture, not a good biscuit. I can make better Bisquick biscuits at home. The gravy was ok, not horrible, but nothing to brag about. And, the potatoes, I just didn't get it. I poked around at them hoping they would magically turn into something that tasted good, but I left them on my plate just as they came.  Would I come back to give them a second chance? Absolutely not. There was not one thing on my plate that was worth the splurge. I make better biscuits and gravy at home. Why would I go out to eat mediocre food?",

My sons meal had hash browns when he asked for red potatoes (twice), my wife didn't get the egg whites she ordered, got bacon instead of sausage and pancakes instead of toast. The server was apologetic, but at no time did a manager come by our table to talk with us about all the mistakes. We had to ask for our check 3 times and when it came no compensation for all the mistakes was offered.   I paid the 30+ dollars and decided we'd just have to find a new breakfast place for the future.",

The Hollandaise breakfast needed to be seasoned more. It just wasn't that good. My omelette was pretty runny and my potatoes were underdone. The biscuits, that the place is named after, were good but not memorable. The staff was pleasant and the atmosphere was clean and warm. I just wish the food was better.

    "text": "\"If you don't eat all your vegetables there won't BE an economic recovery!\" said a frustrated mom to her son right as our group passed her table one recent summer afternoon for a quick lunch. Or at least that's what it sounded to ME like she was saying. The server sat us in right about the middle of the restaurant and my seat faced the window where I could see the Dobson road traffic passing by. I studied the menu looking for something to catch my eye and appetite. I settled on the BBQ Western Bacon Burger. Portions were huge and you get a lot of bang for the buck. The burger was alright but nothing that makes me want to come running back over here for another one. One of my dining companions got the Classic Club sandwich for $10.49 and holy fecal matter, batman! That sandwich was huuuuuuuge! I think that one was definitely meant for sharing. Heck, you could probably feed a family of four with that as long as nobody in that family requires two seats for air travel. But that's a secret for now apparently. The place wasn't packed when we came by. Not sure if this place that once housed the slightly overpriced Vietnamese restaurant Anise (which probably couldn't compete with the two cheaper Vietnamese joints right across the street in the Lee Lee's mall) will make it into our lunch rotation or not. I do know one thing - if I find myself starving and low on cash, the Classic Club is definitely an awesome value meal!!",

The cinnamon roll was nice and soft, but had kind of a funny aftertaste. The coffee was OK. There were assorted flavors of coffee creamers at the table, not my thing as I prefer half and half, but good if you're into that. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful, but perhaps a bit over attentive. Can't say I'd go there as a destination, but I wouldn't object if someone suggested it.",

There were plenty of employees and places to sit,  but no one was acting as host/hostess.  We really should of cut our losses there, but we waited.  We finally were seated, and  for 10 minutes with no server, or anyone acknowledging us.  It was strange.   As we looked around only 1 table out of 10 or so had food.  We gave up and left.  I am not sure if the staff wasn't trained properly or there was no manager directing people. There was a bunch of staff but they weren't really helping anyone.  We really wanted to try this place out, but the lack of service made it not possible.",

The service was quick with water & coffee and very friendly.  It took 9 minutes for our food to arrive once we placed our order.  That was great service with how busy the restaurant was.  I gave it 3 stars because although the service was 5 stars, the food quality was not.  My potatoes were extremely salty and my omelet was bland.  The amount of food on the plate was enormous though!  My husband said he felt like he was on an episode of man vs. food!  I really wish all restaurants had servers like this restaurant!!",

Service was mediocre (maybe the only reason to give one star) and we had to wait 35 minutes for our food. When the food finally arrived the sight on our plate was almost unexplainable. My eggs,  supposedly sunny side up, were raw seeping with a clear goo as if straight out of the shell. My wife's eggs were also raw as if straight out of the shell. My pancakes were so undercooked that I hope the grill was malfunctioning so Biscuits has a semblance of an excuse for destroying an easy and common breakfast dish. My wife's french toast was also still covered in raw egg batter leaving an undesired shine and soggy texture. In conclusion, the experience was horrific and pathetic especially because Biscuits is a breakfast/lunch establishment. It would have been nice to have a manager to speak to about the horrific experience, for the very least, he/she could ensure it would not happen to other guests, but there was not a manager on site at the time. For Biscuits sake, we hope the single bite we consumed does not make us sick.",

The space is roomy and inviting and the staff is friendly and knowledgable. We started with coffee, which was hot and very tasty.  The menu is extensive and covers all of the breakfast and lunch favorites anyone could ask for. The prices are moderate averaging around $10 per person for breakfast entrees but which may seem a bit expensive but once your food arrives, you will know why! My wife ordered the chorizo omelette which was awesome and huge, served with an equally huge portion of perfectly cooked hash browns and two very large, impeccably toasted sourdough slices. I ordered the biscuits and gravy which is accompanied by two eggs and your choice of bacon, sausage or ham. I ordered my eggs over medium and the bacon. The eggs were a bsolutely perfect and the bacon was thick and tasty. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!",

Biscuits Cafe is definitely one of those cafes; once you wake up to after a night out.  A night out with Jack, Jose, Sam Adams that is - wink!  Needless to say, Biscuits Cafe is a breakfast and brunch joint that serves up some wholesome breakfast mom used to make.  If you were born in the 50's and your mother actually cooked 3 main meals a day!  As that is now gone, Biscuits Cafe is probably one of the few closest place that brings that to life.  Welcome to the 21st century and I'm not talking about the insurance business!   I ordered their Chicken Fried Steak and guess what else it came with?  Bacon, hash browns, scrambled eggs, and pancakes!  Wowza!  I'm a quality guy and not so much a quantity so this was too much food.  I nibbled around and my Chicken Fried Steak wasn't too bad.  The gravy a top was nice and creamy and kept it warm.  The bacon was crispy and the hash browns were too.  The pancakes, well they were dry.  In the end, the entire meal was pretty dry aside from my gravy.   Overall, it was a nice experience and I rather enjoy long breakfasts with friends. The place itself is like an old school diner and service was good. - Enjoy!",

    "text": "Really nice patio area.  In addition to patio dining area it appears there's a place to sit while waiting to be seated.  Another plus. I was preceded by my son to the table so no clue how hospitable the host/hostess may have been.  Our waitress was timely and quite pleasant.  She used language that must work like subliminal messages because she seemed to convince me that I would enjoy my dining experience, even though it is not the same Biscuits I originally thought, and that I would be coming back here to dine again in the near future. After me taking a lengthy period of time to decide what I was hungry for we managed to place our order.  I will say that our waitress checked in at least three times before I had made up my mind.  Another plus.  I've sat and waited at other restaurants because I wasn't ready to order when the server first came to take an order. This girl was on task. My coffee mug was never empty and my son's beverage got to no less than 1/3 full during our meal. I ordered two eggs with rare bacon, red potatoes and a sweet potato pancake.  I asked if I could substitute the pancake and was told yes, but it would be one instead of two.  Heck, that's more than enough for me. Son had the chicken fried steak with the hash browns and biscuits.  He said the hash browns were not good at all, even after salt & pepper.  I suspect the were over boiled cuz how else could they be bad? My potatoes were good.  Creamy, nicely spiced and enhanced with a bit of onion.  My bacon was darn near perfect.  Thick, not excessively fatty and cooked to order.  Lots of places can't manage that last part.   And the sweet potato pancake was really good.  It was well flavored, dense and required no butter or syrup to enjoy.  A tad of butter and syrup seemed to transform my pancake into something more reminisce of sweet potato pie.  I shared it with my son and we got through about half of the thing.  He said the biscuit was light and fluffy in comparison.  A good contrast. Overall, nice atmosphere, wonderful service and tasty food.   We'll be back.",

She came and took our drink order 10 min after being seated.  15 min later, still no coffee, so I went and found her and asked for coffee  She brought it, and said sorry we were out of cups...... (seriously?),  she took our breakfast order and dissappeared for the rest of the morning.  30 min later, a different server brought our food.  During this time, no one came to fill our cups so my husband went and found the pot and gave us both a refill.  After our food was delivered, Angie came by to make sure our food was right.  When I pointed out I asked for hash browns and got breakfast potatoes, she snarkily said, we I can bring you hash browns.... (seriously?)  Again, never came by to refill our cups or check on us again.  A different server came to clear our plates  When we decided to leave, we had to go find Angie again so we could get our check.  Not a great experience, never ever going back again.  It's a shame since the food is good and the other servers really hustle.",

I had a hankering for corned beef and hash, so that's what I ordered. Unfortunately it wasn't quite what I was expecting...at other brunch places I've been to, the corned beef and hash browns are cooked and served together, but here the corned beef was served with scrambled eggs on top, and the hash browns were on the side. I was a bit disappointed by that.  Other than the disappointing food, everything else was great. Service was prompt, our food came out quickly, and our server stopped by our table multiple times to inquire about our meal.",

I've seen this place get packed, and its no joke, G!  My waiter, Darryl, was professional yet personable, allowing me time to look at the menu after offering a few suggestions.  The chicken fajita omelette was just the thing to satisfy the protein deficiency in me.  That bad boy was massive.  I dont think it was 4 eggs massive, but it was fairly sizable.  That entree came with hash browns and 2 large pancakes.  All were satisfying.  All in all, a good meal for when you're pondering the hand that life has dealt you... you know, when you feel like Ethan Hawke sitting at a card table in Training Day",

The place was cozy and spacious with friendly service.   This was my first visit to Arizona, and the French toast with berries instantly made my day. It was divine! The berries were fresh, and the French toast was soft and sweet. The syrup was just the right amount of sweetness as it is not stark raving sweet. The portion was fairly large so don't worry about them skimping out. My friend's plate was humungous. It seemed like the food was going to fall off his plate. Lol. He's a guy, and if he says it's a lot of food for him, then it's a lot of food.  I would totally recommend this place to anyone wanting a delicious brunch meal with a cozy place to sit and talk.",

    "text": "Let me tell you about the amazing breakfast I had last Sunday. Having mentally bookmarked Biscuits Cafe several times, we finally pulled the trigger to check it out. On the outside, the restaurant is unassuming, so I'll do the bragging for them.   Despite it looking busy, we were seated right away. Our waitress came by to wish us a good morning and pour us coffee and water. Their coffee mugs have a sleek black design with their red logo - also for purchase on the way out.   We pored through the menu calling attention to the great variety of breakfast specialties: Corned beef hash, black oak kielbasa, chicken apple sausage... I could go on. I ordered the Kielbasa, that came with two eggs, hash browns and a choice of biscuits, toast or pancakes. I chose the biscuits, which were soft and warm, tearing apart easily for me to lather on butter and what tasted like strawberry preserves. I don't often share amazing food, but I had to give my girlfriend a taste so she could see what I was raving about. Let me also point out that the hash browns are no ordinary helping. They overflow along the sides of your plate, offering a wonderfully tasty crunch and fresh potato underneath. And, the Kielbasa had just enough spicy, smoky tenderness to satisfy even the pickiest of sausage fans.  If my girlfriend hadn't ordered the Avocado Benedict, I would have. Fans of poached egg and hollandaise creations, look no further! These come with tomato and avocado, hash browns or red potatoes. Well assembled and not runny or soggy. Definitely in my top 3 of Benedict's ever tasted.  It was hard to leave food on my plate, but I had to. I was just too full to keep going. I can't wait until the next Sunday morning when I can come back for Round 2!",

    "text": "I tell ya, I've eaten here twice and will go back, but it's been interesting each time.  Most of the \"interesting\" vibe centers around the servers.    The first time, Mr. M and I both had regular bacon and egg breakfasts with an added order of B & G.  The place is named Biscuits for God's sake, so we must try the B.    The bacon is spectacular.  It was cooked perfectly and tasted and smelled how a BBQ smokehouse does.  Loved that.  Everything else was fine, except for the B & G.  It must have been an exception, because other reviewers have raved about it, but ours had 2 hard, dry biscuits.  No amount of gravy is going to soften those up in the 2 minutes it's at our table.  And speaking of the gravy, I could taste an overwhelming floury, pasty flavor and texture to the gravy.  My guess is someone was over-baked themselves that morning and made a thin batch of gravy and then went overboard with the flour or cornstarch or roux or whatever they use to thicken it.   I'm chalking that up as a fluke and will try those again.    Our server on the first visit was just straight up weird.  She acted like she didn't want to get too close to the table and would stand behind my left shoulder to talk to us, then would hustle away after we gave our orders.  Very strange.    The second time was a great visit overall, other than our server, Richard.  We were the only table seated outside at that time and it was a lovely sunny morning just before the heat ratcheted up.   When Richard greeted us he was very friendly and all smiles.  He took our order and that's the last we saw of him until it was check time.    They give you very teeny water glasses and those were empty in no time.  I also had a cafe mocha and that was very tasty and pretty as well.  I would definitely have that again.  The lack of water refills was annoying, but if I get annoyed enough I'll get up and go ask for more.     The avocado benedict was absolutely perfect.  The English muffin was toasted and then the eggs were cooked about medium.  Runny yolk, but not watery.  And the avocado was fresh, creamy deliciousness.   Fresh tomatoes as well that tasted like they were from the garden.  That meal was so good I'm going to have a hard time trying something else when I go back.    Mr. M got a regular bacon and egg breakfast but added a pancake so we could give that a try.  Everything he ordered was delicious as well.  We were eating kind of slowly for a change and just enjoying the morning and the weather when a busboy came on out and didn't say a word, but reached over us to attempt to grab the plate with a half-eaten pancake.   Oh no.  Oh no.  You do not want to risk losing a digit by doing that.  I was kind of shocked he didn't say a word, and I politely informed him we weren't finished yet.  I asked for more water, but never got it.  Ten minutes later here comes long-lost Richard, all smiles, presenting us with the check and thanking us profusely for coming in....laying it on pretty thick.  Richard, do you think I was born yesterday?  Your performance today earned you about a 12% tip, maybe less if I wasn't in such a good mood.  Servers should always come back and check about 2 minutes after the food has been dropped, and then about 10-15 minutes later and have their eyes open for drink refills.  At a minimum.  I learned it and lived it.  You can too.",

    "text": "Hey y'all!  I was so excited to see a new breakfast place settle into what I think is a very prime location - perfect for a huge residential neighborhood that doesn't want to travel north to Good Egg, east to Ihop or south for Mimi's.  I ordered the corned beef hash (one of my personal favorites that is not always on a breakfast menu, crazy - I know right?)  Husband wanted the Florentine Benedict without the spinach, but got talked into the Avocado, the kids chocolate chip pancakes.  I had a nibble ... well ... okay, I had like three nibbles and it was a very yummy pancake.  They were excited about their hot chocolates - the do a great job presenting it!  I liked my corned beef hash, but it was probably a little on the healthy side :) as it wasn't oozing with salt.  But that's actually a good thing because I'm trying to watch my portions and the salt would have begged me to devour the whole thing.  There was enough meat and potatoes for three breakfasts.  It was huge.  Poor husband.  He wanted the Florentine without the spinach because it's more like the Eggs Benedict he's accustomed to.  The server suggested the Avocado thinking that would be better but it didn't have HAM.  So he was a little deflated.  The hollandaise smelled very strong to me for some reason.  We ordered a side of bacon to compensate and while it was 4 slices of natural cut bacon, that was $4 worth of bacon.  Which leads me to the biggest beef ... it's probably a tad pricier than Good Egg and definitely pricier than Ihop.  So I had to nick a star, sorry guys.  Would I go back?  Definitely - I like the convenient location - maybe next time I'll try something a little 'easier' on the eyes.  And I like that it hasn't caught on just yet.  WHO WANTS TO WAIT FOR BREAKFAST?!  I am somewhat a patriot too, so I loved the wood paneled wall that had the Bill of Rights and Constitution framed ... made my heart feel good.  4 stars for good intentions ... and sorry for the long post ... it's a new place and I just wanted to make sure the people were informed.",

Usually, new places have lots of hiccups to work out but this place seems to be dialed-in.  The staff was great.  Our server, Susie, was very sweet and attentive.  I had the Joe's Scramble.  The bacon chunks they mixed in made this an awesome dish.  I will definitely order it again.  This may sound funny, but the wheat toast was really good.  It tasted fresh and the jelly appeared to be made by the restaurant because it was not the usual pre-packaged stuff.  The coffee had a delicious robust flavor.  For my seven-year-old, we ordered the eggs, pancake and sausage patty.  He gobbled it all up.  I tried his pancakes - very fluffy and delicious.  The hot chocolate he ordered came with whipped cream and chocolate sauce drizzled on top.  He was so excited by how fancy it looked.  Their menu was really diverse but not complicated.  I had trouble ordering because they had at least 4 different items I wanted to try.  Again, even though they're new, it looks like they hired really nice people and that always makes things work out in the end.  I will be coming back soon, especially since it's 3 blocks away from me.",

Second, it took our server forever to bring out our food. And i was dry on water before a runner brought our food out and wasn't able to get a refill until we saw our server next when she brought the bill. The bill had extra items on it that we didn't order so we requested that the lady ringing us up take the extra items off and she simply said only our server could change the bill. Ok... Well you would expect her to help us find the server but instead made us wander around the restaurant ourselves looking for her. They fixed it, the bill, no problem but all in all, the staff should be a bit more attentive. They were kind and polite but just a bit lazy. It could have been worse but could have been better. Food was good though so it's a shame that my fiance and myself won't be coming back for more :(",

Never go to a new restaurant the first month it is opened, my mistake the staff is still dealing with hiccups. The first time I went  I ordered the reuben sandwich, my waitress said it would be great. You can get a better reuben at Arby's for less money not to mention they forgot to put the sauce on it. The second time I ordered the corned beef hash. When it came to the table I was impressed until I saw my poached eggs. One was okay the other was missing the white completely. The waitress was happy to correct the egg mishap but instead of just ordering another poached egg she took my entire plate leaving me with nothing as the rest of my family happily ate. When it did finally come it the yolk was almost cooked. I ate it because by then I was hungry, irritated and my family was done.  The corned beef was difinitely the star and was very good, the bacon is also chunky and good. What really surprised me is that even though the manager came over and talked to me about my egg mistake I still had to pay for it which is very POOR business for a place that just opened. I still have hope and will try one more time, if they can't get it right on the third try their out of there!!!",

If we bring the pups and sit outside, they are very accommodating to us. Wish the outdoor was bigger and more shaded, enjoy sitting out. Everything I've ordered has been good. Great price and portions. Close to home. Biscuits and strawberry jam is sooo good. Yes the biscuits are small but, who cares, they are good. One day we had an extra long food wait so our waitress brought us out biscuits and jam to snack on--great service!",

We could not believe our eyes when the server placed our order in front of us.  The food looked too good to eat.  The food tasted even better.  The portions were way beyond what  we could possibly eat.  My favorite meal is breakfast and I have prepared many and have eaten way too many bad ones out.  This was the best ever.  N/w corner of Warner and Dobson .    A little information-  I gave this place a try because I had the opportunity to see the kitchen a few weeks prior.  Spotless!  The cleanest restaurant kitchen I have ever been in.     Worth every penny.",

It came with very generous sides of potatoes and something else, which I substituted for raw tomatoes since it was way too much food for one person to eat at one sitting.  My companion had a pancake/scrambled egg combo which was again...way too much food if one has a normal appetite.  For a big eater, this is a great place!  The manager was most definitely visible and \"hands-on\" in the visible kitchen.  If you are into a \"breakfast/lunch/close at 2:30pm\" kind of place, Biscuits Cafe should be on your to-do list.  Pretty, clean, and pretty good food.",

She touched the rims of the glasses with her hands, which were covered with cleaning solution. After 30 minutes our food was still not served and four other parties were served before us. We saw one of our items sitting on the counter getting cold for 15 minutes while the other servers were bending over the counter and squishing the food with their aprons.  When we complained about how long it was taking the manager started arguing with us, so we left the payment on the table in cash and walked out. The attitudes of the staff and manager are EXTREMELY poor. Not only does this place NOT care about the quality of service it also seems that the employees ignore health codes and do not care about remaining in business. STAY AWAY AND DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!",

    "text": "I've driven by here a lot on my way to work and thought my boyfriend and I would have to try it one day.  Today happened to be that day and we had a bogo coupon that came in the mail. It was 10am and the place was empty except for 3-4 tables, plus the table in the very back by the bathroom that had a group of older people, (I personally would not sit back there as I would feel like an ignored customer.) We were seated quite quickly at an awkward booth and chair table. Looked at the giant menu that was overpriced while waiting for drinks to find what looked tasty and ordered. My boyfriend ordered a simple waffle and I ordered the southwest delight scramble with biscuits and red potatoes,  it sounded good. The description was three scrambled eggs, with peppers, onions, tomatoes,  spicy chorizo sausage (mind you it says spicy), salsa, sour cream, and corn tortillas.  After about 10-15 minutes our food arrived. His waffle was mediocre and kind of dry he stated. Mine, it was thrown on the plate and was not pleasant to look at. As I stated earlier about the spicy chorizo, there was no spice to be had. The eggs were soggy and were loaded with stringy onions and mushy tomatoes with no peppers to be seen. It was very bland. The potatoes were burt to a crisp. You think of a biscuit being hot, light, and fluffy, these were heavy, tasteless, balls of dough. As I was studying my plate I came to notice my salsa, sour cream and corn tortillas were missing from the dish. I did not bother to ask because it would not have made the meal better. I was done after two bites. I just finished my biscuit and ate what non burnt potatoes I could find. Our waitress came by to see how things were going and I bluntly put it out there that my dish was bland and not good. She seemed oblivious, stated \"oh!\" and walked away. We thought she was getting a manager, but turns out just went back to serving her other tables with nothing else to be said only to come back and drop the check. We will not be back. Bad food and bad service. I wouldn't even give this one star but you have to rate it something.",

Now I have changed my review because they have continually disappointed me.  They never seem to get my eggs cooked the way I like them.  The corn beef hash use to be fresh and plentiful and now they are skimpy and dry.  The bacon (use to give 4 and now only 3?) my husband ordered was greasy and not crispy.  He likes his toast to be well toasted and they brought them out completely burnt.  It was sent back and all they did was scrape some of the burnt off the toast.  Our eggs were either underdone or overcooked.   They didn't even look appetizing.  The last time we were there the manager saw what was happening but didn't even come to our table to apologize.   So disappointing each time and we kept giving them another chance.  Their quantity and quality has gone down.  Most plates being fairly pricey at 10 bucks a plate for breakfast,  we think now its not worth it. Their motto \"fresh and fast\",  I think NOT.",

I'm talking beautifully poached eggs, waiting to ooze out runny yolks at the gentle prick of a fork or knife, slathered generously with velvety smooth hollandaise sauce with just the right amount of citrus... yaaaaas!  That's what J-WoW likes!  Yes, it's bad for you.  We're talking about condensing all your daily recommended allotment for protein, fat [50+ grams], cholesterol [500+ mg], calories [1,000+], and salt into ONE SERVING.  Throw on a side of hash browns and a giant cinnamon roll to nibble on while waiting for your dish and its like, wow, what even?  But like I said, I'm not up for brunch usually and I certainly don't eat breakfast during my work days so why not?  It's Saturday.  Can I live?  So I came to Biscuits Cafe for my eggy indulgence.  While I positively drooled over their warm gooey cinnamon roll that was probably the size of my face, I was already fantasizing about sliding my knife across a gorgeous poached egg.  I wanted my knife to mar that perfection hidden behind hollandaise and spew its yolky guts all over my plate as I lick my knife clean and marvel at the gruesome display.  I swear we're talking about assassinating eggs, people.  What I got though were soft medium-boiled eggs and hollandaise sauce with no hint of lemon juice.  My heart was sad but it was still demolished.  Although I did trade half of one of my avocado eggs benedict for a few bites of Southern Delight scramble.  Dang.  That was some greasy egg, yo.  While I do think the quality and ingredients are decent at Biscuits, I don't think I'll be popping in to fulfill my eggs benedict craving.  Dat cinnamon bun doe.  Mmm!",

I ordered breakfast thinking that any restaurant that had Biscuit in the name and is displayed on their building must have GREAT biscuits. It's fair to note that I am a southern boy and know my biscuits and gravy.  Their biscuits are small and bland. Yes there is a hint of buttermilk but they are over-kneaded and a little over cooked. Over-kneaded biscuit dough becomes bread dough taking away the flaky texture that we want in a good biscuit. Next the gravy. It was doughy and filled with herbs. Herbs in cream gravy? Really? I know they were trying to simulate the sausage flavor with out adding sausage but hey for $12.50!!! I got two dinky eggs smothered in grill shortening (ugh!), three strips of bacon (ok) and two small biscuits with really sub standard gravy.  Put sausage in your gravy! If you do need a better recipe, use real cream, real breakfast sausage that's cooked and drained, and just slightly brown your flour roux to give it a nutty bread flavor and not a doughy imitation flavor. And really guys make fresh homemade buttermilk biscuits and make them big ( like your Cinnamon on rolls). You may not make your margins but you will bring in and establish regulars. Otherwise Change your name, at this point you're being deceptive.",

I did substitute berries for potatoes as my side but still it was $22 (over $25 with the tip) for a plate of eggs and a cup of coffee.

The hash browns have some kind of weird taste like the oil is bad or something but I put the sausage gravy on it and then it's great.  The sausage gravy is the best I have ever had.  It has some kind of herb that just add that little something that other places don't have.   Service is always terrific.  The wait staff are so friendly and polite.  I don't know their names but in particular there is a young African American man and a petite lady with short brown hair who always make you feels so welcome.  I know it can be a demanding job, but these two always seem like there is nothing they would rather do than help you.  Really nice customer service.   The cinnamon rolls are amazing, similar to Cinnabon but better.   I once had a patti melt but wasn't impressed.  The bread wasn't crunchy and the burger was greasy.  I'll stick to the breakfast as they have never let me down with that!!!!  This is a great place to dine.",

The waitress acted like she did not want to wait on me.  They actually acted like my family was invisable.  They looked me straight in my eyes several times and looked over me several times.  I thought I was in the Twilight Zone.  The cherry on top was when a waitress asked me and my family to move from our table as though we were a problem.  I politely got up and left and nobody attempted to stop me.  Let me add that the bathroom was filthy.  I got the distinct feeling that the staff did not want to wait on us because we were Black.  This has never happened to me at this particular place, but I have been around long enough to know when I am not wanted in an establishment.  I will never go to this restaurant again and I will no longer recommend it to friends and family.",

It's the American dream, right?  I have been here at least 10 times. Everything I've had tastes homemade. This is no greasy spoon kind of joint.   There was once a corned beef eggs Benedict as a special and it was spectacular! I have asked for it since and they will happily make it for me. It is definitely homemade with large meaty chunks of corned beef. To die for!  The French toast is also very, very good and usually what I order. The difficult choice is which one to order. I think there is four options. I have had the almond crusted once and cinnamon roll version a few times. The almond crusted was really delicious, but I keep going back to the cinnamon roll version.  Imagine cinnamon rolls sliced, dipped in egg batter and cooked to perfection. I order the grilled ham with it. They cook it so it is browned on the edges, but still moist and not dried out. Just the way I like it.   I have taken friends and family to my new favorite breakfast place and all have really enjoyed the food and great service. They are a very friendly staff.   I stopped in for lunch once and had the turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce. It wasn't bad, I was just underwhelmed. Their breakfasts just set the bar to a higher standard. I have heard that the burgers are great.  Maybe next time I'll try one.",

When management changed Biscuits tanked. The food and service suffered. A few days ago my wife said she had a coupon. I reluctantly decided to go again and see if things changed. Horrible is the best word I can give my experience!!! 3 meals- BLT with avocado, corned beef, biscuits and gravy w/ eggs and bacon. No avocado on sandwich, corned beef sopping wet soggy, biscuits plate was cold. Several coffee runners passed my table without asking if I wanted a refill. I returned my sandwich and had Monica our waitress remove my meal from the bill. Monica said she could get avocado for my sandwich. I declined. From that moment Monica's attitude became distant towards us. I told the cashier and I believe shift leader about our experience. They seemed shocked and reluctantly apologized. I have in the past voiced my distaste with the decline in service to no avail. Needless to say but I will, I will not be spending my money at Biscuits no matter how many coupons they send!!!",

I ordered off of the \"Keeping it Simple\" section, where you basically get to choose three of the numerous options listed.  I did enjoy the sweet potato pancake, but as for everything else, it was pretty standard breakfast stuff.  My husband ordered the biscuits and gravy, which is their specialty.  He wasn't too impressed with it, perhaps because it was lacking in flavor.  Overall, we'd probably go back, but as far as brunch places go, this one was decent, but not very memorable.",

The staff was top notch with fast friendly service. I had the ham and eggs with a pancake and hash browns. Everything was very flavorful and cooked perfectly.  My friend had the made from scratch corned beef hash and it looked awesome so I will want to try that myself next time. They had a sign on the door \"We don't serve fast food, we serve good food as fast as we can\"  The strawberry preserves were really good, I was tempted to buy a jar of them on my way out. Price was reasonable for the quality and quantity of food I received. I will definitely be a regular here!",

Once we were seated, we noticed how cute the decor inside was and how many great choices the menu offers. I decided to get an omellete, red potatoes and biscuits and gravy. We waited about 15 minutes for food but everything that came out was good. Service was spotty but not complaining. I would come back to try some of the other menu items.",

First off the coffee was ok and there was no fresh cream only package cream, second we asked our server about the chicken fried steak. He said it was the best thing on menu. But it comes frozen!?!? After our food came we asked a few more questions because it didn't taste right. Everything they have and serve is FROZEN!!!!! Even the eggs are not real eggs! They come in a huge bag!!! My eggs Benedict I took back because the eggs and hollandaise was all watery!!! I don't get it. This place was packed?!?! We will never eat here again!!!! Waste of money!!! It only gets one star for our server!",

    "text": "This place has a solid breakfast menu that includes generous portions and tasty dishes. Accordingly, it has become one of my regular spots to get a sleep-in, roll-out-of-bed weekend late breakfast. Not all of the dishes are my favorites, however. I tried the almond-crusted French toast and found it a bit heavy and bland. The almond crust seems to Noneify the eggy goodness that usually defines French toast. I recommend the Cinnamon Apple French toast instead. The cooked apples and cream cheese are so luxurious that you forget to drizzle maple syrup on top!  As for the biscuits and gravy, I do find this to be a palatable dish but woefully underseasoned. They have nailed the creaminess of the gravy, but I feel they could step up the sausage and seasoning to make this dish really shine. The bacon here is thick and cooked to perfection, and I have never had any serious issues with the service, although I think sometimes the wait staff needs a tiny amount of prodding to stay on task.  In summary, I'm delighted to have this restaurant in my neighborhood and plan on coming here repeatedly in the forseeable future.",

On a regular basis, I looked at it and thought \"I should try that some time.\"  Hey, it only took a year! After chauffeuring my mom around town this morning, we stopped in to grab lunch. The menu offers a wide variety of breakfast and lunch entrees, and yes, breakfast is served all day.  I opted for the California club. It was enormous. It came smothered in cheese, with perfectly crisp, thick-cut bacon, and the most amazing avocado slices I have ever seen. The turkey was adequate. Nice ciabatta bread, just the right amount of squishy. My potato salad, on the other hand, was more like cold mashed potatoes. If you like smooth potato salad, you'll probably like this. If not, pick another side.  Mom went for the cranberry turkey sandwich. It was notable not only for the fact that it came with cream cheese (weeeird), but that the cream cheese was--I crap you not--a good quarter-inch-thick layer between the bread and the turkey. She reported it to be good, which was probably True since all conversation stopped once she dug in.  Our waitress was on top of things and kept the iced tea flowing. I'd go back. And I probably will, to check out the breakfast offerings.",

    "text": "I was mildly surprise by this place because it is a chain restaurant but they do  very good and quality food. I tried it twice in about a month and look forward to going there again. First the service is pretty quick for pretty good quality food. Second, I like again that they open early, very convenient, people here tend to sleep in I guess so hard to find anyone open before 7:00 AM.   I have to agree with one of the review, in that the biscuit and gravy is not their signature dish, but it is actually one of the best gravy if not tied for the best gravy I have tasted here in the phoenix area. It has rosemary I believe and some additional spices so it is not so bland  or just salty like almost every restaurant. It could use a little more kick to it, and you can provide that since they have like 4 different hot sauces on the table for you. The biscuit is okay, it could be a little heavier or denser, kind of too light  and airy almost like a roll instead of a real biscuit. It is well done and again, one of the best biscuit and gravy I had here in this area.   The other dish I tried was the  corn beef hash. This was probably the second best corn beef hash I have had, the other one was at red bird cafe which is closed now, so I guess it is the best that I know of that you can get. I like my corn beef has to have large chunks of beef and spices and onions etc. The only things that I can nick pick about which I do a lot is that there could be a little more kick to it and there was not that many potatoes and the beef could be seared a little, give it a little more texture and a crunch. I know a lot of people like their corn beef all broken up or smashed up to where it is like baby food, but that is the way I like mine. Again the dish is not the best I have had, but it is up there and a big step ahead of most places.   All in all, their food has quality ingredients and done very well to excellent. The down side it is a little tempered down, but by their clientele, I can see why(a lot of seniors). They are a little on the pricier side, but I look forward to trying other things on their menu.",

    "text": "I went to the website first to  contact them and wasn't going to yelp them.  I live close by and have been here a few times.  Every single time something is messed up.  My honest opinion is that its the management.  They need to train their employees.  Some things are not common sense.  For example during todays breakfast the waitress think her name is Michelle came over and asked the girlfriend if she wanted a refill.  Because she had basically been slow the entire meal I asked for one also mine was half full.  On the way to fill it up she stops and takes an order.  Setting out drinking on a resting table.  Common sense is that when I'm eating my meal I want to have a beverage at the same time.  And I do not want to wait for you to take an order from silver hairs which predictably  took a long time to place the order so I got up and took my drink back.  No apology.  No recognition that a mistake had been made.  Maybe she didn't realize that is not the proper way to serve a table.  Tip.  When someone flags you down while you are doing a refill tell them you just have to refill the drink and you will be right back.  So maybe things aren't common sense like when you serve potatoes.  You can't mix two batches together.  One that is crispy and another one that is raw.  You actually want to try to have your food come out consistent.  They should always be cooked the same.  Customers are not very crazy about having a few raw potatoes in every bite.  This is not the first time I have had issues at this place.  It is a cute place and they do have the best Jelly I have ever had ever. So at some point in time some one knew what they where doing.  But maybe when they setup shop in Arizona they sent out someone who was not qualified to train and open new restaurants.  I would like to believe if you go to Oregon they operate better.  I wish I could remember what some of the previous issues were. But I know it has been 6 months and mistake I tried it again.  Thing is if they cared about doing things properly they would have feedback forms in the restaurant.  And maybe a way on the website to send a message.  I'm not going to send snail mail to the corporate office to complain.  So hopefully they read this review get better management and train their employees cooks and servers.  This could be a great restaurant with a little care and TLC.  So you are warned. It's a roll of the dice if you will have a good or bad experience.",

My mom and I split a meal and we couldn't even finish it.  The food was pretty decent. I got the apple chicken sausage meal. I was excited for the sausage but it was pretty bland. Pancakes and eggs were good. Potatoes were greasy and chewy, Coffee was good. My sister got one of the specialty egg Benedict's and the whole plate was covered in gravy. Didn't look appealing to me but my sister said it tasted pretty good.  I didn't like that they charged us an extra $2.50 to share a plate.  Overall, it was a good experience.

    "text": "Oddly, the biscuits weren't all that great, but the gravy was good. It seemed like the biscuits were the kind of standard mass produced products that you would expect at at a supermarket. I like my biscuits toasted on top and I like them to have a taste and texture beyond bland spongy bread -- especially considering this is their signature food. The biscuits were rather small considering the price -- and the gravy wasn't hot. If I didn't know better the cafe used Pillsbury dough for their biscuits. Eeek!  Overall BC is a great  place to get a meal that tastes very homemade. The red potatoes are heavenly and the french toast is about the best I have had. The coffee was good too.   The corned beef is good but I wouldn't recommend ordering this with red potatoes because the potatoes used to make the hash are very similar. You end up with a big plate of potatoes.  The eggs are disappointing. When I order two eggs I want two separate eggs, not one big round thing containing two egg yolks.  I came during off hours. The service was very good and friendly.  To me BC seemed sort of high priced, but the quality made the experience worth it.",

    "text": "Ugh, so disappointed. Just tried this place for the first time. We have a 2 year old son and it's not easy to go out to eat with him so we ordered breakfast to go. We had a rough morning walking out to a dead car battery and had a hectic morning. So when we got home without our full order of food, I was upset, we called Biscuits Cafe to let them know we were missing an item and they told us to back come in and get it. We live 6 miles away from this restaurant, so it's not just down the street. My husband went to the restruant and picked up the item, they didn't offer him anything complimentary for the inconvience nor did they even appoligize. This was the last thing we needed to deal with on top of our hectic morning. Unfortunately I will not be coming back here and I will not be recommending this place whatsoever.  $35 for a cold breakfast... Beyond disappointing.",

The coffee is flavorful not watered down chicory. CONS: Serving portion could be your next 3 meals with a price tag to match.",

    "text": "Thought we would check it out as we heard from a friend who works here the food is fantastic.  We are typically leary of new places but today was the day and we drove over to Warner and Dobson to Biscuits Cafe.  We didn't feel like waiting the usual wait time at another favorite location and hoped this place would be quicker.  We were seated immediately and confused as the one seating us, a server, stated she would return with our drinks and then another server came to get our drink order.  No biggie but that was the only thing quickly that happened.    There were four of us and we ordered an omelet, another omelet and two biscuit and gravy breakfasts.  Nothing special ordered.  No changes to the menu.    Literally, 45 minutes later, I asked our server if there was an issue with our meal and did we order something difficult.  She explained the kitchen was very backed up which was odd as the restaurant was NOT full with several open tables AND three tables seated well after us had already received their meals, finished them and two were just about to cash out.  Finally, at 53 minutes from the time of order, we received our food which was wonderful.  Spectacular taste, serving sizes and not cold in the slightest.  Was the wait worth it?  Not really but it was quite satisfying.  The manager comp'd our entire meal as an apology which was nice but still, I'm not sure I want to try this again.  Three stars only because of the slow meal preparation and obvious mistruth as to the reason.",

    "text": "I drive by this place several days each week, intrigued yes.  One would think with a name of Biscuits that would be a signature dish, wrong!  I arrived around 0900 Sunday, the parking lot about half full.  Seats were placed outside the front door,maybe a sign the food is good if there is a que. Upon my arrival the place was maybe one-third full, you could select your table with ease.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy,egg with cheese, and 2 buttermilk pancakes. The service was pretty quick,food arrived timely. But that is where the good review ends.  The butter on the pancakes would not melt, little surprise as the pancakes were like room temperature. The eggs were cold,and the biscuit and gravy same. The biscuit was like 2 inches in diameter, pretty small. The plate the meal was served on was room temp at best, maybe that contributed to the cold food and maybe there was a delay in brining my food to me.  Bottom line, terrible experience. Who likes a cold breakfast. I WONT be back.  You gotta be kiddin!!!",

    "text": "Wanted to try a new place out for breakfast. I remembered this place so I decided to check it out. I have to say I looked over the reviews before hand, of course, and was a little jaded by some of the bad reviews. I arrived and was greeted and seated right away. It looked like a very nice place. Small but not tiny and pretty busy. I saw on the chalkboard in front that the Blueberry Pancake Combo was featured today. I thought it was a special but saw it on the menu and realized it was just featured. So server came over and was very nice. Took the drink order. Those came back pretty quick. Then placed the food order. He was very helpful even with a very particular special order. Food came out in a timely manner and piping hot. Pancakes were a good size and very good. Blueberries were fresh. Bacon was nice and thick and just right. Eggs were done just the way I had asked. Everything was very good. Even tried one of their biscuits. How can you not when that is the name of the place and they were really good too. Pancakes really filled me up could not finish. Stuffed in a good way. Overall, I thought the food was great, service was good and fast, the prices weren't bad and the place was nice and clean. I don't understand the bad reviews unless they came on a bad day or not everyone can be pleased. Don't know but I will be back to try out some of the other stuff on the menu that looked good. It was nice to find a new place for breakfast especially after some old favorites have gone down hill recently.",

The waitresses are always extremely nice and helpful. I don't know what it is about the batter that they use to fry, but its delicious. I usually get the chicken fried steak (so good) and substitute my toast for some fruit; they give you a very substantial amount of fruit and they almost never add the $2 up charge to my bill, and if they did I wouldn't mind because they don't skimp and I know fruit can get expensive especially if substituting for bread.They also have a pretty good rewards program and when I was signing up they asked if I wanted to include any other family birthdays or special occasions to receive extra money off on those days. They definitely didn't have to do that. I've never left this place unhappy- only once were my eggs not cooked enough and she took them back immediately and replaced them with fresh ones. All in all, if you're looking for a good breakfast/lunch place I fully recommend Biscuits Cafe! (at least this location)",
