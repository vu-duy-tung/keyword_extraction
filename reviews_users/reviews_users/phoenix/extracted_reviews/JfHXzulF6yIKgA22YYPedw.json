My wife had the beef tamales which were good but too spicy for her liking. What I loved the most was the service. I'm speaking for me and my wife as part of this review but we also had my three kids my father in law and his wife,my brother in law and wife and two kids so we had a huge party and no one was disappointed. They brought our food out all at one time in a timely manner and we're all very kind. Our server was Cameron and he didn't miss a beat. The treasure chest they have for the kids was a added bonus and even though it wasn't immaculate toys in it, it was a kind gesture and the kids loved it. Great job Aunt chiladas.",

I had a margarita and it was a bit sorry.  Tasted like it was from the cheap mix I drank in college.  Then came the food...it was a soggy plate of nachos with cans of junk dumped on it.  I ordered a taco because I was starving and the nachos were inedible.  The taco was soggy and greasy.  While the Trivia night was fun and i will go back...I think I will get a beer and try something else next time.",

The dining area was about 25% full but they had to take 15 minutes to put a table together, by the fireplace. We had to have them turn the fireplace off as it was too hot.  Drinks ordered and it took another 15 minutes to get any of them to our table.  I tried to order Huevos Rancheros which is not on the dinner menu. Other mexican restaurants will normally make this. Not Aunt Chilada's. The waiter said the chef would chew him out if he took any special order to the kitchen. Again, they were not busy and they have Huevos Rancheros on their weekend breakfast menu.  I've eaten at this restaurant before when visiting Phoenix. This was by far the worst experience of all from the service to the food and just the general attitude about us as customers.",

Nothing was too spicey and after I left I didn't feel overfull or have a stomach ache which is rare bc I'm pregnant. The chips are literally to die for!!

The food is OK, not good but not bad (I'm from Southern California so my standards for Mexican food are very high and sadly the food here doesn't cut it enough for that fifth star)  But the place is so cool that I would bring anyone here despite the fact that I could have better food elsewhere. Every time I come here in fact, it seems like I discover yet another dinning room that I didn't know existed. You have THREE bars to choose from, my personal favorite being the outdoor bar by the bocce ball court. It has a cool tropical feel that almost makes me feel like I'm at a resort bar (the resort bar where all the drunks hang out)  The servers are always friendly and the crowd that hangs out at that bar are always a good time. It's just a fun place to hang out and people watch. I love to come here and get my drink on.  The bonus for me is that I live pretty close so as long as I don't ever stumble on to 16th street into oncoming traffic, I could probably walk home.",

There was another man that completely impressed me, he wore a completely different attire than the rest of the staff, he wore a red collard shirt and red cap, he was running food and clearning tables, asking how dinners were and if he could bring them anything else, if this was a manager, your team is very lucky to have a hands on guy like him. The tortilla soup was amazing and the fried icecream, to die for.",

    "text": "If only more restaurants could be like Aunt Chilada's. I'm happy that I have been able to visit several times and look forward to many more visits in the future!  First of all, this place is oozing with history. Did you know that long before Arizona was even a state, this establishment used to be a brothel? Yes, a brothel! Well now, it's of course the furthest thing from a brothel but you can still feel the history living in the walls and parts of the restaurant feel like stepping into a different decade all together.  Second of all, the environment. If there's a restaurant that screams party, this is it and I'm talking about a party for all ages. Whether you're visiting with family and looking for a lively establishment with plenty of patio seating, fun games and hearty food, or you're out with friends eager to share some laughs over margaritas, live music and trivia night, this restaurant's got your covered. This is the ideal restaurant for large parties, private parties and more. They have two very large patios with two outdoor bars, a huge indoor bar area, a spacious main dining room and a more private dining room in the back (that happens to be the original building that housed the brothel!)   Third, let's talk about the activities. This restaurant knows how to keep their guests entertained! They have live music, trivia nights, bocce ball tournaments, chocolate fountains on Sundays, and special events including a fiesta bash on Cinco de Mayo...just to name a few.   Fourth and finally, the food. The food is solid Americanized Mexican food. The Nachos are hefty, the pollo Fundido is cheesy & creamy and the quesadillas are a good greasy (the kind you want when eating a quesadilla). This food is exactly what I would expect and hope for when visiting Aunt Chilada's. It's the perfect type of food for this family-friendly, fiesta inspired establishment.   PS - did you know that these fine folks also happen to own Rustlers Rooste...that awesome cowboy establishment in Tempe complete with a live bull, slide and two stepping? Yes, these folks know how to have fun!",

    "text": "Was here for the 5th meeting of the Breakfast Club UYE. Such a great group with a few regulars and a rotating band of others. I always enjoy meeting new people and it is good to see the regulars as always. It being Cinco De Mayo month a Mexican theme was chosen and Aunt Chilada's was the place. I have been to the Tempe location a few times but I think I might prefer this one. The patio area was really great. The weather was perfect to sit outside. Probably the last time it will be. I like the fact that the main restaurant has been there forever. I like historic old buildings. We sat down and a few others trickled in. Our waitress brought us out the chips and salsa and also informed us to not leave the table unattended because the birds will have no problem stealing your chips. She took our drink orders and once everyone was seated and ready our food orders. I settled on the Chorizo con Huevos with the eggs over easy. My food was very good. According to the menu the dish contained Jesus's homemade chorizo which was \"heavenly\", wacka wacka. I have never had this before but the eggs with the meat was very good. It was all stacked on a crispy blue corn tortilla. It came with a side of re-fried beans which had a little bit of a skin on them but once I stirred them up they were fine. The entire meal was delicious. They do include a chocolate fountain with all breakfasts but I am not that into fruit so just had a few chocolate covered marshmallows. I will say that the service was a little slow but with all of the great conversations going on it was a little hard to notice. Plus it did take a little while to get our checks and get them paid but the waitress did split them up for us which they don't usually do for a group as big as ours. Overall she did a great job for having two large parties plus other tables to deal with. I would like to go back again and try the other breakfast items plus maybe some of the dinner selections.",

Our menu: Spinach enchiladas Chicken tacos Chicken enchilada Fideo Rice Refried beans House margarita Margarita w/Tres Generaciones and Grand Marnier Chips + salsa  Spinach enchiladas were mushy and flavorless - probably frozen spinach and too much cheese. Chicken enchiladas were so-so, a little heavy on the sauce.  Tacos and chips were great - flaky, made fresh, good eats. The salsas were both pretty tasty - one chunky and one smooth and spicy.  Both margaritas were pretty good and not expensive. Sounds like Aunt Chilada's is good for sitting at the bar, drinking, and eating chips while you listen to the band. Go elsewhere for dinner.",

On the last visit, we sat outside close to the bocce ball court, of which we took advantage to play several games while waiting for our meal.  The chips and salsa are awesome (we all actually like black olives in our salsa, so that is a nice addition to perk it up), with the homemade flour chips our favorite.  My margarita on the rocks was nice and tart.  My daughter and I both got the chile relleno plate; the relleno had just enough spicy heat with a light, crisp batter coating.  My husband said his chicken quesadillla was great, and my son, who is not into Mexican food, had a burger that was cooked perfectly medium.  Tres leches cake made a perfect ending to our meal, and there was enough so that all 4 of us had a healthy portion.  This gem of a restaurant is hidden away off the beaten path...

We were surprised by the friendly environment, good food and terrific service.  All of us enjoyed our meals, whether they were house specials or your American-ized combination plates.  A laid back environment with good Mexican food and good margaritas.  It really hit the spot after a 5 hour road trip!",

    "text": "I was here a good 10 years ago.  Service and food was great back then.  My how things go bad so quickly!  First thing that set me off was nothing has changed in 10 years and it looks like a few things need repaired.  The wait was about a half hour.  My son almost fell after sitting in a broken chair.  Finally we were seated.  The homemade chips were good but the bottom ones were store bought.  The old put the store bought chips on the bottom trick.  I should have walked then but everyone was tired of waiting and hungry.  My son is a picky eater to say least.  I ordered a cheese quesadilla for my kid.  I specifically told the waitress, NO ONIONS, NO TOMATOES, and NOTHING BUT CHEESE.  I even told her if he finds one it will cause an incident.  She seemed to understand. The food I ordered was OK.  I had to use my salsa to make it a little hotter.  I can eat fire so this is no surprise.  My son's cheese quesadilla had tomatoes in it.  At first I told him it was just one and I picked it off.  Then he kept finding them in every slice.  I called the waitress over and explained.   She apologized and took the plate back.  A few min. went by and the waitress had the NERVE to come out and ask if it was just one.  I had already told her it had tomatoes all over in it.  At this time I felt humiliated by her actions and told her just bring a cheese crisp and I'll pay the difference.  It took a while for that to get to our table but all was OK.  While we ate a waiter dropped a napkin bringing food to another table.  When he came back I thought he'd pick it up after almost tripping on it himself.  Nope, he left it there so someone else could trip on it.  He came back a few minutes later so I flagged him down and let him know about the napkin.  Instead of saying \"oh I'll pick it up right away.\"  The waiter boomed in a very loud voice how sorry he was and it would never happen again.  He was loud enough for everyone to hear in the room.  Again, I felt humiliated.  I guess not wanting the restaurant to get sued because some waiter won't pick up a napkin was asking too much.  The waitress did comp my sons food.  I will never go back.  At one time that area had some very nice places.  The area had CLASS.  That's not the case anymore.  5/10/14",

We were not greeted upon entering and had to tell them that we wanted to be seated. We were then brought to a dining room that had ball of the ambience of a school hall with plastic table clothes included. Our server was not even closely familiar with the food or food preparation. When asked how the fideo was prepared, she said, \"they cook it\".  Thanks captain obvious. My husband asked if there was anything spicy and she said the steak and jalapeno fajitas were. He then asked if anything else was and she said \"Well, the steak and jalapeno fajitas are\".....she does not belong waiting on people.  So the food. The food is microwaved!! Soggy, gross enchilada, mushy and dry tamale, lackluster salsa, fideo that had been in a steam pan since yesterday. The highlight was the almost average fajitas.  No bueno !",

    "text": "I give this place one star, begrudgingly. The only good thing about this place was the ambiance and the service at the bar. I am appalled by the service we had at the table. I have never been treated so badly. We had a party of 6, and we chose a table on the patio. The patio was really cool and full of party goers, mostly large groups of people. We sat for about an hour and a half without a server, so we got our drinks from the bar.  No big deal.Finally we decided we wanted some food, so a member of our group flagged down a waitress. Big mistake! The server, Cindy, was the WORST! She was so rude. She explained that no one knew whose table ours was, so no one waited on us. My sister tried to order and she snapped at her, \"I am waiting until everyone is ready to order!\" I suggested maybe we should order from the bar and then she snapped at me, \"You cannot order from the bar! You have to order from me.\" We ordered our food and, after several eye rolls, Cindy left our table. I seriously should have talked to a manager because she was so rude to our party. She continually rolled her eyes when we ordered drinks. The food came and it was awful. I ordered the shrimp tacos. They were completely dry and almost inedible.  I will never go back to this establishment. I cannot believe the treatment we received. This woman should not be in the service industry. I would think, in this economy, there are plenty if servers who would have wanted to wait on a party like ours. We spent $200 at table, not even counting the drinks we got at the bar. We are all upper middle class people; there was no reason Cindy would have thought we would not have tipped her well. I always give servers the benefit of the doubt; I was a server for 10 years, so I understand they have bad days. But this behavior was inexcusable and shocking. Cindy was the rudest server I have EVER had. I cannot even explain it in words. It wasn't what she said, it was the condescending tone, eye rolling, and abrupt responses.",

I remember the food being better, so I have been upset with some of the changes, however, I will still make this a once a week stop.  The chips and salsa are AWARD WINNING and for GOOD REASON.  Ask for the flour chips only.  They are the reason to visit this restaurant.  Their chicken quesadilla is amazing and their food is decent, but definitely go for the chips & salsa.  You'll pay a bit much for the food, but it is definitely worth it.  Just remember to come for dinner early if you are visiting on a Wednesday or a Friday or there's only street parking available.  The bar gets to be pretty packed on these nights.",

So I decided to hedge my bets and go with four.  Here's why: the food is average at best, but the ambiance is outstanding and the happy hour is superb.   In terms of straight up Mexican cuisine, this place doesn't even approach what some other nearby spots have to offer. But, their indoor/outdoor patios are always a good time, they have great live music, and a happy hour with free munchies to boot.   Cherry on top: their chips are awesome. They cook them in house and bring them out for free with your drink order.",

    "text": "Staying at a local hotel and was recommended Aunt Chiladas by our Uber driver. The outdoor patio ambiance was nice but we got a side outdoor area that felt a bit secluded from the nicer scene. The drinks and food was fine. I'm mostly downing the stars because of their lack of gluten free knowledge. Their menu clearly identifies gluten free or gluten modified items yet the server wasn't fully aware of the ingredients in the menu items. When the chips arrived, there was zero mention that they mix flour and corn tortillas. Of course I bit I to a flour chip the first bite. The food was fine, nothing to brag about but the lack of gluten knowledge (especially having pointed GF items out in the menu) really brought down the experience for me here.",

I understand having to go home because someone isn't feeling well. But to have customers sit for 30 minutes with not one waiter/waitress  to come by and check on you is HORRIBLE customer service.",

I had brought a book to read while eating, but couldn't even see the pages.  The best part of the menu was the ceviche. If a restaurant has ceviche, you know the food is good. I cannot resist raw seafood.  The tortilla soup was ok, and the chips and salsa was above average. The chips were REALLY good actually.  The bloody maria (tequila rather than vodka) was also average, nothing special. Heck, it was even on special and the waitress charged me full price. With all the advertising saying this was the best mexican place around, I expected alot better.",

    "text": "Aunt Chilada's is a one-location Mexican-themed restaurant which is basically the in-house restaurant for the Pointe Hilton at Squaw Peak.  The previous local locations have been closed and the North Phoenix location remains.  Already that is a plus in their favor.  Thankfully it has more fun and character and less overpriced food and drink than most hotel restaurants.  It is a decent size and has both indoor and outdoor dining areas. We had a party of about a dozen so it's hard to describe each meal.  Because I had a large late lunch my dinner I had the lettuce wraps, which came in at less than $9 and very filling.  There is a good selection of cold tap beers and of course a full bar.  Service was excellent for a restaurant that does such a large business with business travelers and vacationeers (i.e. snowbirds).  We were there during trivia night so we expected things to be on the loud, rowdy side and they were.  The only negative was after that group left and there were only a few small groups of people, the house did not adjust the background music down to a more appropriate level.  Before posting this I thought I would check out the \"worst\" reviews (and yes they actually are the worst reviews).  Not surprisingly the stereotype is True that most of them are from towns that are not exactly known for their knowledge and appreciation of Mexican food, you know, where they think Taco Bell is gourmet?  No, in reality, Aunt Chilada's is not gourmet, but it is decently good, the ambiance is great and the wait staff is many steps above average.",

The other is through the restaurant in the back. I recommend this back patio. It's very large - on warmer days they have the misters flowing freely, and the cool strung lights at night. The trees around it make it feel somewhat secluded, and as the temperatures go down, this is the perfect spot to have a margarita or beer.  That being said: Happy Hour and Friday should really go together. During the week, Aunt Chilada's has happy hour snacks for free. Usually enchiladas, chips and salsa, etc. But on Fridays, they step it up 5 notches. The happy hour food goes on the back patio, where you can get chips, usually taco meat, beans, enchiladas, veggie tray, fruit, salsa, etc. for free. They continuously refill the free food while it is happy hour, so don't fret if the enchilada tray is empty.   One of my favorite patios in Phoenix.",

They sat us outside as the tables inside were all reserved for regulars. They assigned us 1 waitress to take care of over 30 people. During the 3 hours I was there the waitress never said a word to me. I had to go to the bar to get the 2 drinks I had and never got the food I wanted. Now I was planning on getting a carne asada burrito ($16) and I usually have 3-4 Jack and Cokes ($8 each) so easily $50. Afterwards I talked to people who for the most part were in the same boat, waitress would talk to 1 maybe 2 people and leave for 10 min, so no one ordered anything from her, less than half the people ate, and no one drank like normal. They could have easily pulled $1500 to $2000 in sales and $300 to $400 tip for the wait staff....but giving us only one person, who never was around, and they made less than a quarter of that. I'd say go an enjoy, but realize you're paying extra for it being in a rich neighborhood and go in a small group where you will actually get service.",

The olives that were in the salsa add no flavor. When we ordered are  drinks they took forever to come to us. Then when we asked are water about what was in the beef taco on the kids menu she replied \"just beef\" which is fine so we ordered the beef tacos for the kids. Then after a very long wait for are Food the kids tacos came and It wasn't beef tacos they were BEAN tacos. How could they mess that up? The only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because the out door environment was super nice. So my wife who loves Mexican food is right you can tell a lot about a Mexican restaurant from the salsa.",

Randy, the host, is great: funny with generally good diction and pronunciation. His personality and the easy parking are what keep me coming back.   The tables are small, so it gets a little cramped. The waitresses are nice, but they don't come around often. I get that it gets busy, but it's not THAT busy. The food is perfectly average, definitely more expensive than its worth. I usually get the seafood quesadilla, although the jalapeno steak fajitas are also pretty good. I will say I like their chips though. They're not for everyone, but they are for me!",

You feel like you are far away.   -Host staff were super friendly and suggested we choose a table right next to the fountain.  -Music at dinnertime in the dining room was the right volume.  -Homemade flour tortilla chips.  -Good green chile sauce, rice and black beans.  -Cold beer with fresh lime.  -More than 1 vegetarian option, and 1 was even labeled vegan. Wait staff was knowledgeable about which side dishes were vegetarian.  -Prices are reasonable.  -Food arrived quickly.  -Able to accommodate large parties--I could see several.  -Generous portions.  On the con side:  -Was not a fan of the salsa--it tasted like Tostino's from the jar.  -Vegetable burrito was filled with broccoli, cauliflower, carrot and a tiny amount of green pepper. This is a strange assortment of veggies to put in a burrito and did not taste good with the chile sauce. The vegetables were in huge chunks, barely cooked, still crunchy, and unseasoned. It was an enormous burrito meant to be eaten with fork and knife I guess, but served with a butter knife.  -I was going to send the burrito back for additional cooking, but the server didn't come back to check on us until we were ready to leave.  There was a vegan fajita on the menu. I will come back someday and try that.",

Reservations were booked, but we just walked in and got seated right away. The chips and salsa were terrific and so was the guacamole. They kept bringing more as we devoured them. We had the chili relleno and green corn tamale, both were delicious. We were impressed by the large portions, good service, and ambiance.  There are a million places in town for Mexican food but for the price I don't think you can do better.",

The frozen margaritas are perfect, as are the accompanying fresh chips and salsa (the taco sauce is wonderful). The service can be somewhat spotty, but it's a big place with lots going on, and food is always delivered quickly and has always been great. Really an interesting place, perhaps even the quintessential Phoenix experience.",

Definitely on my top 3 favorite Mexican restaurants! I stand by the first part of my review.. but after visiting multiple times since then I've realized the food is sub par. Really no good flavor. Sour cream tastes weird. Why do they not have normal rice? Even their guacamole isn't great, which is a big thing for me when it comes to mexican food. The food can be mediocre but as long as I can put some good tasting guacamole I'm normally okay. Kind of a bummer but I will continue coming just for the margaritas and flour tortilla chips.",

For starters we ordered guacamole which was fresh, full of flavor and chopped pico de gallo.  This was a great first impression. They also came with corn and melt in your mouth flour tortilla chips. BEST EVER!!  They were so damn good that I asked for a to-go bag. They were also a perfect match for the spinach queso dip.   As if I had any room in my stomach for anything else the pineapple shrimp came out in a half of grilled pineapple. It was basically shrimp fajitas with pineapples sans the tortillas.  I took it to go and can't wait to devour the leftovers.  If you're in the area come give this spot a visit.",

The good: the chips are great and the salsa has a nice flavor, albeit devoid of any spice. The food, once ordered, arrived quickly.   The bad: we waited at least 15 minutes for a waitress to even stop by our table. The food was marginal at best. The shrimp taco was tasty, but completely forgettable. The tacos de Jesus were one of the more disappointing meals I've had since moving to Phoenix. Once we received our food, our waitress stopped by before we had even had a chance to try anything to see how we liked it and then never returned. My husband had to get up and go to the front to request our ticket once we had been waiting for over 20 minutes after our meal was finished.",

    "text": "This place has taken a huge dive. Yet another great place down the drain. Why? Probably can't make money paying people 12 bucks to wash dishes. So you cut back on the ingredients. Ride the workers you have harder and wait for the place to crumble. I am not sure who made the menu but if they went to culinary school they must have barely passed.  We were seated in a basically empty dinning room. But do they seat us near the beautiful fire? Nope by the open door letting in the cold. Table was broken too. My wife kept banging her knees on the part that is supposed to be locked up until you want a round table.   You are given a huge bowl is weird looking nastiness. My wife is allergic to gluten. So she takes a bit before I tell her to stop. They have turned flour tortillas into this weird looking sopapilla type item with no sugar or cinnamon or taste. You get to add tasteless salsa too!  We were told the corn chips are hidden underneath. Why? Heck if I know. When you find them they are straight from the bag.   I get the street tacos with machacca.  I do not know if they run all the meat through the same wood chipper or what. I am used to machacca being shredded. What I got was ground like beef and full of bad fatty meat. No taste there either. By the time I get to the third and wondering why I am bothering the corn tortilla has become so soaked with grease that it fell apart. That made not eating the third one easy.  I gave them 2 for the pretty building. If you like pretty buildings and lost your taste buds in a horrible accident you are going to love this place. The rest of you.  AVOID!  WARNING the next day I noticed my brand new shirt and pants had been ruined. They looked like they got bleach stained. I used the bathroom here and I think they bleached the counters but don't wipe clean. I lost 100 bucks in clothing. By far the WORST experience ever.",

For a variety of reasons we required a lot of accommodations (speakers, a mic, projector, screen for a slide show...and lots of margaritas.) And boy did they really came through for us! But here's the kicker, we brought all of that equipment with us from California, but couldn't get it to work. So Steve, the manager stepped up and offered to loan us their equipments...which worked beautifully. Michelle, our event planner was excellent as well; responsive, helpful and creative in problem solving.  Even though the whole restaurant was very busy that night we had excellent service and attention. The food was FABULOUS, the atmosphere was ideal and the party was a big success. I told them at the end of the event that I was going to write a rave review, that they had earned, and I hope this lives up to it. They deserve it.  I wish I could have given 6 or 7 stars.   BTW, my husband was in the hospitality business for 40 years, so we know a bit about great service and Aunt Chiladas delivered. Too bad they're not in the SF Bay Area! If my review isn't clear, then I hope this is: I HIGHLY recommend Aunt Chiladas (the one on Dreamy Draw,) especially for special events.",

Being that I reside in southern California, I hadn't really enjoyed the opportunity of returning until now.  Exactly as I recalled!  This visit, I brought a friend who is a new citizen of Phoenix.  We both raved at how Aunt Chiladas is a tremendous step up from your average Mexican food eatery -- on many levels.  The staff was friendly and attentive -- especially our waiter, Patrick.  We modified our choices slightly off- menu, and Patrick offered suggestions that might enhance our orders.  He knows his stuff!  My friend told me he'll be bringing people in whenever they visit, and thanked me for finding the place for him.  Kudos!",

The bar is comfortable (we ate at the bar 1st time in-we were there for an event...-) Had the Jesus Tacos-- great stuff! Had to come back and try more of the menu-- and it just so happened that Hatch Green were in season, and Gr Chile stew was the featured item that evening-- my personal favorite. I also bought some roasted/peeled Hatch for take -home-- I would recommend this place if you have out of towners and want to show them a GREAT example of Arizona style mexi-cuisine.

They're like little triangles of heaven melting on your tongue. Salsa, guac, hot sauce, it's doesn't matter! I eat them plain! By the handful! I actually dipped the tortilla chips IN the chocolate fountain.  But I'm getting ahead of myself. The decor at Aunt Chilada's is rainbow cactus chic. Not a dull table or view from anywhere in the restaurant. The service is top notch. You can tell a lot of people have been working here a while which makes me believe they treat the staff well. The plates of food are large, complete with refried beans, pico de gallo, lettuce and cheese. All of which you can scoop up with the TORTILLA CHIPS FROM GOD.  But really, the food here is incredible. The chocolate fountain is on Sundays for brunch. And the tortilla chips are all the damn time. It seems a bit off the beaten path, but well worth the drive. It is a must-go every time I'm in the area. Go forth and salivate.",

So I ventured out.   I hit up the Happy Hour here.  The day we went they weren't able to provide any draft beers because the system was broken. Okay, I'll give that a pass. It was annoying, but eh.  Specials included drafts (which we couldn't have) $3 Coronas. I opted for the margarita which was served in a shaker.  These were $12 but there was about 2 1/2 drinks in there so it came out to be a sweet deal. What I really loved was the free small snacks they offered.  Fruit, chips/salsa, and chicken enchiladas are served during HH.  Free food!    The chips we had there were ridiculous. In a good way.  Chips and salsa/guac are like crack to me in the first place.  But THESE chips were like freebasing meth (I'm not a drug user, I promise).  They were wheat based chips and were outstanding.  It was out of control.  I have been told and told and told some more that the brunch here is to die for.  I will definitely be back to partake.  I didn't order any food because hey, they gave me free enchiladas and I\"m not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.",

    "text": "I thought I was going to really impress some friends when they discovered the highly touted \"famous\" chocolate fountain feature of our surprise Sunday brunch.   Allow me to help manage YOUR expectations, so you're not as disappointed as I was: Yes, there is a chocolate fountain and it is included with your $8-13 brunch entree; but, buy your own(probably identical) model at Wal-mart for $40 and save yourself the heartache of a disappointing meal.   Granted, we came for the \"famous\" chocolate fountain but we were prepared to enjoy breakfast first! Another disappointment.   I had the breakfast burrito and could only stomach the beans. The potatoes tasted like they'd been in the freezer too long. The eggs in my burrito were chewy not \"lightly\" scrambled in the slightest.  The machaca had decent flavor but it was further ruined by the enchilada sauce that tasted straight from a generic can!  One of my guests had pancakes. Sadly, these were neither light nor fluffy, instead they were chewy and tough just like my eggs.   \"The myriad of accompaniments you can serve with the chocolate fountain are only limited by your imagination\" in theory, but at Aunt Chilada's this past Sunday, your choices were dry chunks of cantaloupe, flavorless honeydew, pineapple cubes, (shall we say \"aged\") marshmallows, and the unimaginative standby: strawberries. Oh! And, crispy lady fingers.   Full disclosure: I did not tell our server how much I hated my burrito or the pancakes and she DID ask how everything tasted.   Truthfully: I was weary from the disappointment. It's one thing to send back an entree but to say everything was unsatisfactory?! I just won't recommend it or plan to return.",

However, the service I received at the bar... not so great We were hanging out her before our flight back to Nj. Our bartender Sarah seemed fine, she was friendly and gave us what we needed, however when we got our check- I wasn't too fond of her anymore.  We were drinking margaritas all afternoon because they were on happy hour, she didn't explain to us that there were two different sizes- and that the larger size wasn't on special... so we were charged full price for A LOT of margaritas. It should be common courtesy to explain the specials to us instead of just serving us the more expensive one without even asking. But that's not all.... that was just mildly irritating...  it was Mexican pizza night, so I asked for a pizza order sheet. Sarah gave me one sheet, I looked at it, it was broken down where you could choose 0-4 toppings all for an additional cost, ok no problem.. but then she takes the paper back and gives me a new sheet telling me \"oh sorry this is the new one, use this\" ok that's fine. The new sheet she hands me has just the meats as an additional cost and the rest of the toppings listed as \"complimentary\". Even better!! I thought.... so we check off a bunch of the \"free\" toppings.. Well when we get out check, we were charged for all the \"free\" toppings... turns out the first menu she gave us WAS the correct one and the toppings were not free.  So after the margarita upcharges and the pizza upcharges, our check was around $70.... not exactly what I expected. Did she really think that I'd give her a bigger tip if she intentionally drove up the price of my check? Sorry. I think not.  We closed out and walked around back where a much nicer, and HONEST, bartender was working. I don't know her name, she was pregnant. She was great! No problems, and she explained the happy hour sizes to us without us asking and instead of just giving us the large and charging us more.....  I would love to give this place 5 stars. But I was SO angry after receiving my check... However I'll definitely go back there if I'm in the Phoenix area again!",

I took the remains home and put the chips and relleno out to see what wildlife would turn up to eat it.  A javelina showed up.  Even the javelina tried the chili relleno but rejected it!   Dog food and chips were acceptable to the pig.  I reported this to my son who said that definitely the food has gone way down hill over the last several years.

If you are unsure, bring your friends and make your own sampler platters by each ordering something different and sharing. If you are into chips and salsa, the mixed homemade corn and flower chips with the salsa are a must. The building is massive with rooms to seat large parties or just a small quiet table. Outdoor fun and games are also a draw for families or adults just looking for a good time.",

The portion is very big so this meal is always bagged and brought home for the next day.    Our server most recently was Angel, and he was excellent!   The only issue I have is it seems a little overpriced for what it is but that comes with the territory of being by so many hotels. This is a True staple of Phoenix!",

    "text": "Who in the world is scoring this place higher than a two? I'm giving it that high of a score simply because my meal itself, (chicken fajitas) were above satisfactory.  The smell of years and years of spilled beer, margaritas, and old food greet you as you walk in the door. You're then seated at a dirty table lined with a thick red vinyl table liner that's so sticky my water cup that was already placed there literally stuck to it. (We should of got up and walked the other direction at this point, but have been there years before, and we're in the area, so wanted to revisit... things were not as I remembered, that or my taste for authentic Mexican has really developed! The chips are a mix of flour and corn, no flavor, and heavy on the greasy side. The salsa is horrid, can tomatoes, sliced black olives, and a few onions and cilantro. No flavor at all! We did ask if they had a spicer version, and the waitress brought out a pureed tomato and red chili sauce. A HINT of spice, better but still not much flavor. The chicken fajitas arrived hot and on traditional sizzling cast iron skillets. The onions, peppers, and chicken had a nice char and flavor. However the sides that accompanied the meal was a little less than palatable, the \"Spanish Rice,\" is actually rice-a-Roni, the beans Bland, and brown shreds of lettuce beneath what should be \"Pico de Gallo,\" again can looking tomatoes and onions. The high prices on the menu do not reflect the quality of food! Do yourself a favor, spend your hard working dollars on real Mexican food, at a million of the other fine, and hole in the wall restaurants, that flood Phoenix!!  Two chicken fajitas and waters with tip, grand total  $35.60 (lunch menu) Disappointing!",

    "text": "I've come to really enjoy Aunt Chiladas! I hadn't heard of them until referred there by a former employee when I was looking for a place to have Sunday watch parties for the Indianapolis Colts fan club I help organize. Unfortunately the 2017 season was not kind to the team, so our attendance was low. But Jennie and her staff were always cheerful and positive when we came, no matter how small the group was. Because most of the Colts games were the 10a/11a early games, we pretty much had TV of choice... and sometimes given sound, or even the big TV and all over sound!   Their chips = BOMB DOT COM. d00d-- how do they make them so effing fluffy and not like a normal tortilla chip?! I could pretty much eat a basket or2 of those myself when I wasn't terribly hungry for something on the brunch menu (besides mimosas and chocolate fondue).   Their menu is massive BTW- and they serve massive plates! Pretty much anytime I'd order from the menu I'd leave with a to-go box. Even the simple things like quesadillas are bigger than my hands! Totally worth the price.  Aunt Chilada's spot is also quite unique to AZ being that they hold AZ liquor license #1 and the building literally has history in the woodwork. Ask one of the family members for the 411 on the building and you'll get taken on a stroll thru AZ history.",

I was seated and brought a menu along with flour tortilla chips (yum!) and salsa.   I started with the cheese crisp. This thing was amazing!! It was a cross between a sauceless pizza and an open faced corn quesadilla. So good. In retrospect, I would've finished that and eaten less of everything else.  From there, I ordered the 2 combo plate: Cheese enchilada (how could I go to a place named Aunt Chilada's and not order one...) and chicken taco. The enchilada was good, and the sour cream I ordered with it had an almost whipped texture. I took one bite of the taco, and decided against it. It was a crunchy corn tortilla, the chicken was breaded and fried (crispy chicken in a taco?).   If I went back, I'd stick to the cheese crisp and a 1 entree plate.  There is also a banquest room, and a large outdoor seating area with a bar and bocci ball court.",

The atmosphere is authentic Mexican....a Bocce court right next to the walkway....fantastic patio for our yelp event....good live music....and there was even a \"Hell's Kitchen\" celebrity chef serving up shrimp in a grille pineapple.   Yelp done it's usual prize giveaways....which are always fun....there was fiesta theme for this event and there was even a \"Adult\" penyata which I don't think anyone was able to break open....LOL!!!! I found out they even do a free buffet during happy hour Monday-Friday 4:30pm until 6:30pm.....that's awesome. So while I don't drink or really like Mexican food.....I highly recommend this location for it's authentic feel and great patio to sit under the stars and Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!",

Everyone was amazing - from Michelle who coordinated my event and assisted with drink and food selections, to the servers, to the manager, to the front desk ladies.  Everyone was attentive, courteous, and helpful.  The food buffet was great (everyone loved the green corn tamales) and both the food and drinks were very affordable. There were no hidden costs and no worries.  They even included tables decorated with linens and balloons at no extra charge. I highly recommend using them for an event - they made sure everything went perfectly and we had a blast!",

I used to come here once a week for my business meetings with Mona Vie. The place has a lot of room and is great for large parties. Our group of people always have a great time here. The staff are very friendly and pay close attention to your requests. I would definitely call for a reservation if you plan to have a group larger than 4 or 5 people. This place can getting a little busy during the usually dinner rush. Just a word of advise for you.    Last time I ate here I tried the chicken enchiladas they were amazing! I had a Margarita also very good.   I definitely recommend visiting this place if you're looking for a great Mexican food themed restaurant.",

What a disappointment and waste of $$ our table was lopsided almost spilled out drinks several times, wait for food was 45 minutes and the restaurant was empty with 1 other table besides ours, food was nothing special! We spoke to Marvin the evening manager about the wait for food and his response was sorry but we have a huge party. No excuse!  If you can manage a party and main dining room then you shouldn't be in business. Unfortunately we chose this place to eat because it was near our hotel! I plan to call the hotel to let them know not to recommend this place for their guest! I should have stayed to eat at the hotel and spend the extra $$ especially when celebrating a special occasion! I give this place zero stars!",

When we arrived we were greeted and we asked to be seated indoors. We were seated in the back where we sat for 25 minutes before a server came to take our order. Once our drinks came we placed our order. We each ordered a chorizo plate, our order came and upon taking the first bite we found the chorizo was so spicy we could not eat it! We were already frustrated with noone coming to check on us after we had been seated and now the chorizo was too spicy to eat! We waited another 10 minutes, before our server came to our table to check on us, when we finally asked to speak to a manager to let them know about our terrible experience. A manager comes to the table where we tell him about our frustrations with the service and food and his demeanor was very nonchalant. We got the impression he just didn't care. At the end of our conversation he stated \"so tone it down a bit?\" (meaning the chorizo) while he hurriedly walked off as his staff told him \"the linen people were there\". No apology, no care that his restaurant and/or staff weren't doing well, nothing! A simple apology would have been fine. Needless to say, we will never be returning to Aunt Chilada's. Hope Aunt Chilada's remembers they are there because of the customers.",

Make sure you reserve or wait for a table on the patio - don't worry there are heaters in the winter & spitzy misters in the summer. I've been having dinners there on the patio since I first moved to Phoenix as a kiddo and it never doesn't seem magical in the evening. Like you are in another place / another time. Important tip: Ask for extra flour chips and the hot sauce to compliment the full & wonderful salsa that comes with the chips. Those flour chips are sooooooo uhhhhh that it is nearly impossible to convince your mouth that you've had enough of tasting them. The fajitas are good, the tacos are good, the buffalo chicken is somehow good, the enchiladas are good. I can't say this is gourmet fare, but it is pretty delicious and the perfect fare for sitting on that patio. Family friendly, dog friendly, crowds friendly. ALSO - how did I almost forget to mention their happy hour that has a full spread of their food for you to nibble on while having some drinks!? Def check that out - but not the same scene as bringing out of towners to dinner on the patio.",

The restaurant is large with  indoor and outdoor seating and the bar provides nice dining options to accommodate large parties.     Aunt Chiladas offers a large variety of Mexican/Tex-Mex options. We had the taco bar, tosadas, chicken enchiladas, rice, beans, salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was hot and fresh but to be honest there was nothing too exciting about their dishes. The food and service were just average. Although, I would have to say that the chips and salsa were really tasty.  Maybe, I caught Aunt Chimadas on an off day. Prehaps, I will visit again and give it another try.",

After 25 minutes of sitting at our table we flagged down our waiter and asked if he could help us.  He said that he was busy with big tables. Never once did he greet us or say he'd be with us in a minute.  We ordered our appetizer,\"guacamole,\" and dinner entrees, as we got the vibe that we were not going to be waited on. After almost 30-35 minutes later we flagged our waiter over asking about our appetizer.  He said they ran out... never thought of telling us.  He brought us complementary queso but never brought the chips.  Food was subpar, horrible service, never refilled drinks or asked if we needed dessert or anything else.",

I had forgotten to make that request on my reservation, you have to sit outside to eat here. Patience paid off when one of the other reservations changed theirs to an inside table and we lucked out! The hostess was just as happy as we were, which was so sweet. We also had the best table for our group (two little ones and a baby) away from the noise of the bar festivities. Dogs are also allowed on the patio, and two very big well behaved ones were right behind us. We all love dogs, so it was not a problem. Waiters were great all evening, prompt and polite and accommodating, even checking if the boys (ages 5 and 3) drinks needed to have lids, very smart idea. Chips and salsa were very good, the salsa has a really nice texture too, olives? Our spinach and chicken enchiladas were great, nice sauce and good size pieces of chicken, the rest of the table were happy with their meals as well. We were able to sit and relax for as long as we wanted, never feeling that we needed to hurry. There was a wedding or some sort of celebration inside so the music was fun to listen to. The boys loved running back and forth on the bocce ball court after they ate (thank goodness!). Thanks for a great night Aunt Chilada, we know we can always count on you for a perfect restaurant choice with out of town guests. Make sure the staff gets a big thank you as well, great job!",

    "text": "I used to love this place about 20 years ago. The food was consistently great and service was pretty good was well.  NOT ANYMORE. I was part of a party of 16 dining on Saturday, December 22 and all I can say about that is, just don't eat here. My husband ordered the Tacos de Jesus, and I ordered a taco salad with chicken (gluten free) and both were terrible. My salad came out almost 5 minutes after everyone else's food, not to mention the fact that it was wrong. I had ordered it with jalapenos, which weren't on it at all, and it was supposed to come with sour cream, which wasn't on it at all either. However I was so hungry and everyone else was almost halfway done eating by the time my food arrived, I didn't bother to send it back and wait any longer. Regardless, I barely ate any of it because it was disgusting. The chicken was rubbery and flavorless, and there were so many beans in it the lettuce was wilted and slimey. It just didn't taste good. I tasted the meat from my husbands tacos, and it tasted the way I would imagine wet dog food tastes. It was not good at all. The overall review of everyone else's meals in our party was very similar. This place was not cheap and I felt bad for my family that they had paid for dinner for 16 people, and this was the quality of the food and service. We won't be back again. Such a bummer.",

Originally they told us it was going to be about 30 minutes but luckily they found us a table quickly. After we sat down we quickly ordered a drink, we were there for happy hour.  The margarita was all right but very small and very weak.  The waitress actually never came back so we just left cash on the table and left.  We saw several wait staff walked by us quite a few times before we decided to leave. We drank our entire drink and then waited about 10 more minutes for her to come back but she never did.  This was on like a Tuesday night, now I can see why the reviews are so bad.",

    "text": "I just left this restaurant 15 minutes ago and decided to sign up for Yelp to write this review.   Listen, Aunt Chilada's, before tonight... was a mediocre restaurant near where my boyfriend works. We'd sometimes go there for lunch if we needed a quick bite, and the salsa was good. So it was there to fill our need if we really had nowhere else to go. That being said, tonight was a disaster.  I'm sure it's because they had a few large groups of people who'd already sat down before us in the banquet room, wherever that is. But we waited for over an hour for our food. When it arrived, my burrito had cheese in it (I am lactose intolerant and asked for none). The waiter was courteous and zipped back to get me my correct order, but came back a mere ten seconds later with a cold burrito. Really? I know I've already waited, but at least give it to me warm.  All in all, the server generally ignored us because the table to our left was angry they weren't getting any food, and the table to the right of us had a solid 30 people in it. So, I get it in a sense. But it would've been nice to have them tell us straight out that they had a 46 person table on the other side of the restuarant that just ordered, and that the giant party to our right hadn't gotten their food yet either. It would've saved me a lot of time. Definitely was not worth the money, and never will return again.",

This place has been a staple in the valley before the 51 went by etc etc.  It definitely looks like it has been there for a while and needs a good  asthetic cleaning.  Our table and chairs were sticky and it was pretty dirty outside on the patio.  There were chairs and miscellaneous items on the outside of the restaurant and it needs some TLC.  Chips (flour) are good but salsa has black olives (yuk, personal preference) and the hot stuff tasted like it had vinegar in it.  It has a great patio for daytime drinking.  Overall the food is above average.  I ordered the fish tacos and they were good.  My accomplice ordered a combo with your typical rice, beans, enchilada, taco etc.  The food was hot and good.  It didn't have a wow factor but the price was good and worth the money.  Holy smokes.......The service was awful.  I am not going to mention any names but it was slow in terms of business and even slower in terms of service.  I hope that they do not correlate but they usually do.  C'mon Aunty you are better than this!!!!!!    If you live in the neighborhood then it is worth going here.  I probably will not make the drive again.  Good luck Aunt Chiladas.",

My family decided after much talk that we wanted mexican food, so I suggested AC, because even though I haven't been there in like 3 years, I us to love the food and service.  When we arrived around 3pm, we notice that there were hardly anyone there, my husband thought that was strange.  We decided to sit inside because the outside looked pretty lonely.  The guy at the door directed us to the right of the restaurant, there were one group of two ladies, that were leaving and us... so we wait, and wait, and wait... then a group of about 4 people sat down, and we still waiting... I notice that we didn't even have water, we looked around and there were two girls sitting to what it looks like the back area, complaining and talking, I know cause they were loud.  Out of know where comes this waiter and completely bypass us and went straight to the table that came after us... My husband looked at me got up and we left... that's when the waiter said hi... it was so bad.  What I also noticed is how dirty this place is, the fixture have pounds of dust, everything is dusty and looks dingy, so my though was, what is going on here, my husband responded, if this place looks this bad, I wonder about kitchen... sad, so sad, WHAT HAPPENED TO AUNT CHILADAS...WE ARE NEVER COMING BACK.  Down the street is Los Reyes de la Torta, is on a little strip mall, but the place is clean, service is impeccable and food was amazing... at least something good came out of all this.",

The chocolate fountain was a huge disappointment, there weren't enough strawberries and all that was left were cantaloupes and honeydews and when we asked for more they said they did not have anymore strawberries...that's not good service of planning for a prearranged party.

    "text": "DON'T GO! Don't waste your money, energy time or patience.  Remember .... You will never regain those precious moments of your life back!!!! DON'T DO IT, DON'T GO!! This place was so horrendous, I downloaded the yelp app just to leave a fair warning to any other unsuspecting folks. Seriously. I refuse to use Facebook and here I am writing this review. Here goes. I moved to this neighborhood abt 4 months ago from the East Coast and so many people rave abt this place. It's right by the resort, so I've been thinking that to survive it's gotta be decent right? I've driven by on a weekend, a weeknight... Always packed, no parking anywhere in sight with what appeared to be great and fun outdoor seating and a sprawling interior. So I finally make my way on over today... Mid afternoon on a beautiful Saturday when there's still parking and outdoor seating available. So excited.... I'm thinking... Yay me! Great food, clearly popular, nice spot to sit out and munch on a gorgeous day..... NOT!! Such an unsuspecting lamb I was!!!! Despite poor layout for parking and no clearly marked entrance... I find my way inside only to be wandering around looking for someone to seat me. After a few minutes at the hostess stand, popping my head around the corner to the inside bar with no acknowledgment, I make my way outside to the patio bar and inquire abt seating..... The poor woman behind the bar was fighting with an empty keg or something and only suggested someone would seat me from the (unmanned) hostess stand. I return inside and magically there are two employees there, clearly neither a hostess, no hello, no apology, no smile, no \"hey you have toilet paper on your shoe\"..... NOTHING.... just blank stares. I inquired abt seating. I finally made my way with my mute escort to a table after clearly expecting far too much from them to stop a random conversation to do their job.  It took a good 5-10 minutes before anyone showed up to my table.... Salsa with chips that were fried tortillas or more like the fried noodles in a Chinese restaurant.... A glass bottle of water.... And a waitress that seemed like a strung out 13 year old. I finally gave up asking her to repeat herself as I couldn't hear or understand her (I am a perfectly healthy, multi-lingual 30-something) and just ordered a beer.  It took her a good 10 minutes to deliver and return to take my order. The food? When it finally arrived? Awful. No flavor. The plate was all watery. And she spilled that watery whatever on me because her wrist was too weak when she was delivering my plate. Geesh. The food was not fully cooked through and was cold. It all tasted stale, freezer burned and just plain gross. That outdoor seating? The few tables of people at this time of day were all cramped in the same area with one larger family party.  Rather annoying and unnecessary. Was not once asked how my meal was, if I wanted another drink (maybe a few shots would have taken the edge off??!!?) When my check came? The waitress charged my card for the table next to mine and visa versa and handed us each other's credit card. Then when we both sent her back to correct it, she returned and handed us each the other's void. We had to coach her that neither of us wanted or should have the other's personal info. She seemed annoyed.  And we were so exceptionally calm and nice unlike so many would be. Unreal. Oh!  One more thing....  a bird in the tree above me crapped on my arm right after I was seated. I love animals. I do. I like to believe bird poo is good luck. It's a stretch here. All I can conjure is I was fortunate enough to get that extra napkin early on so I was prepared for the cleanup when she spilled my plate of watery crap on me.  Oh! And I actually got my debit card back and seem to have escaped without food poisoning. But the night is still young. We shall see. What a horrific dump of a place with awful staff and service. Just plain horrible.   NO STARS!!",

Their website says you have to arrive by 4:30 in order to reserve patio seating, but upon calling we discovered they don't adhere to that policy. Too late; we had to sit inside. The server was so rude that we asked for another. Food took an hour to get. They got at least two orders wrong - three times! They refused to split the tab. We discovered why service was taking so long when a member of our party went searching for the restroom and discovered the entire staff huddled in the hallway talking about our horrible table. I never saw the patio, just the nearly empty room they sat us in to wait for food. The food was typical Mexican food. I can't remember worse service at a restaurant.",

Whether it is sitting outside at the outdoor bar or seeking refuge in the air conditioning it is simply the best part of my trip. All I have to do is follow the painted chili peppers from Hilton ( I actually use them to get home if too much patron was consumed .....just kidding. I call the Hilton to have the golf cart pick us up! Duh! No, really that is available for hotel guests!) The fish tacos are the best I have ever had and I am a snob from California.  The salsa is southwest style and really good. Very good beans and rice and free buffets daily at happy hour. Who can complain! Bands on Fridays are fun too. Overall this is a gem in the desert. Always featured on Fox TV  and was also spotlighted on Drinking Made Easy. If you haven't been then you are missing out! Live. Love. Eat at Aunt Chilada's.",

    "text": "Bocce Ball's, that was a some spicy Tortillion! What do you think about when you think about Bocce?  I know...my thoughts turn immediately to Mexican food, too! Aunt Chilada's has set up a bocce court right next to the walkway in the courtyard. When I first saw the bocce court, it was jarring...like walking by the sushi bar at Houston's...just because you can doesn't mean you should.  But, someone near the top of the Chilada family may, in fact, be a marketing genius! That thing really got a workout while we were there the other day. The Beautiful Carin and I hadn't been back to Tia Chilada's in a year or so, but we needed to reconnoiter...my strong and handsome son, Zachary and his lovely wife, Sarah are visiting next week and they want to go (good memories of another great visit:) We wandered in at happy hour (absolutely the best time to visit the Chilada family).  Lots of people drinking, eating chips and salsa, etc. (though not as many as past visits...the economy?).  We had no trouble getting a nice table out in the patio area, so we could watch an Italian sports staple being played in a Mexican restaurant:) The people watching at Aunt Chilada's is wonderful..all walks of life, all shapes and sizes...all getting their drink on with cheap margarita's and cheaper cerveza:) It's a tried and True formula for the transition from drone infested, uptight (I know, a word right out of the 60's) work-a-day world to a somewhat more relaxed, slightly (or heavily) inebriated night-time world.  So much fun to watch...esp. the guy with a six pack of margarita's under his belt, trying to bowl the bocce's.  It would be pretty tough to generate a bocce injury, but I think he managed it:) The service was a pretty good...we never had to wait too long for refills and they kept the chips and salsa coming ( the flour tortilla chips are one of the best parts of Aunt Chilada's:) Carin had a serviceable chicken chimichanga, and I had something called a tortillion (which, interestingly enough is numeral based nomenclature for this dish, reflecting the number of calories per serving)...shredded beef, cheese, beans, tomatoes, bacon (bacon!!!!), wrapped in a giant tortilla, dipped in egg batter and deep-fried...it sounded better than it was, but I ate about  1/2 and brought the rest home (might still be in the fridge, growling at me...not sure..afraid to look:) Nope, it's not the best Mexican restaurant in town, and it's not the best bocce court you'll ever see, but combined, they make Aunt Chilada's a decent place to have a bite and a cocktail, and to play the games that people play:)",

The tortilla crust wasn't soggy at all and it did not swim in oil.  Both salsas went well with it.  I ordered the fish tacos.  The fish was not rubbery and had plenty of fresh flavor.  The plate also came with a lemon wedge and a lime wedge.  Perfect meal.  Also liked the Spanish rice much better than the fideo.    The rest of the table ordered the quesadilla sampler and a bean burro.  Both looked pretty good, but I was too busy enjoying my tacos.",

Also, if there are unruly children using the bocce ball court crashing the balls into the wooden frame like when we were there, it makes the lovely outdoor patio a much less desirable place to be.  Definitely will not go here again.",

    "text": "If eating in a filthy daycare center is your idea of a great dining experience, this is a must try place for you!  We stopped in for brunch last Saturday when we were feeling in an adventurous mood and looking to deviate from our tried and True brunch spots.  It was a beautiful day so we asked to be seated outside and as the hostess lead us to our table, it became apparent that there was NOWHERE on the patio and perhaps the entire restaurant that would offer us any solace from the excessive number of running, screaming, sticky fingered children who had apparently consumed too much sugar at the chocolate fountain.  Now, I understand that when sitting outside in the Phoenix area, tables and chairs aren't always spotless due to the dust factor, but one would have expected that our plastic tablecloth would have at least been wiped down sufficiently to remove the layers of food that had accumulated over what I'm guessing was at least the past few months.  After a significant wait, a server (not ours) showed up with some water that was served in glasses designed to hold enough liquid to quench a toddler's thirst (although, given the number of toddlers present, perhaps this was intentional) and some chips, salsa, and hot sauce.  The chips were of both the flour and corn tortilla varieties and were rather heavy on the grease.  The salsa was so mild, the only real flavor that it had was that of the sliced black olives in it, which is not necessarily a quality one seeks in a salsa.  The \"hot\" sauce was actually just as mild as the salsa and was served in a glass bottle that was so filthy and had so much food stuck to the outside of it that my hands were actually sticky from touching it.  At long last, our waiter finally showed up to take our drink order: a mimosa for me and a bloody mary for my husband.  After another ten minutes, he finally reappeared with the drinks and had I not been quick to cover my white shorts with my napkin, we would have been heading home for me to change since he'd spilled the bloody mary while carrying it and cluelessly reached across me with it to set the drink in front of my husband, causing a stream of spilled tomato juice to run down the plastic tablecloth and onto my legs.  The only redeeming factor that pulled this place up to three stars was actually the food.  I ordered a two item combo with a cheese enchilada and a bean & guacamole tostada and when the food finally arrived, it was clear a one item combo would have been more than enough as both items were huge.  All of the tostada ingredients were fresh and tasty and the cheese enchilada was flavorful too.  My husband had the huevos rancheros which he also thought were quite good.  This place is definitely a good value for the price as it's very inexpensive, but having heard that they actually host wedding receptions here, I would have expected a lot more in terms of the atmosphere and service.  It's a place that we won't hurry back to, but won't cross off the list as I've definitely had far worse food and overall dining experiences at other Mexican restaurants in the Valley.",

I personally can do without the flour tortilla chips; I'll usually dig through to get to the corn ones! The salsa rocks and I've always had good service.  A Phoenix must-visit IMHO.",

    "text": "I actually ate at Aunt Chilada's twice yesterday and have eaten there quite often over the last year.  Lunch was good with both the food and the service being done right.  Went back last night because it was a beautiful night and we wanted to sit on the patio.  Initially the hostess was not very accommodating but reversed track and sat us on the patio.  Chips and a bottle of water showed up pretty quickly but unfortunately no glasses.  We sat there for about 10 minutes without seeing anyone else.  I have been in the food service business for years so I am pretty forgiving so this was not a big deal.  What was a big deal was that they were apparently having a function for a girls softball team and while the parents were inside their girls were on the patio \"playing\".  12 - 14 of them yelling and screaming and running around.  While they do have a bocce court on the patio, its not a playground although this was not the first time we have seen children using it as such.  It was the first time there were so many and so loud.  Had we been served a little faster it might not have been so annoying but with nothing to do but sit there and listen to all the noise we decided to leave.  As we got up the waiter hurried over and asked if everything was OK.  We explained we had come for dinner and the noise was too much.  To his credit he asked if he could give us a gift certificate which was nice but didn't mean much as we had made a special trip to enjoy a nice dinner at a nice restaurant.  If we wanted to be around of obnoxious kids on a playground we would have chosen Chucky Cheese or Peter Piper.  Probably won't be returning any time soon as it is a drive for us and not knowing what to expect (nice restaurant or kids day out) its probably not worth the effort.  In regards to the girls softball team, the parents of the Hotshots should be ashamed of themselves.  I coached travel ball for 15 years from 10U through 18 Gold.  My daughter is a coach for one of the premier high school programs here in AZ.  Never would one of my teams been this obnoxious and rude.  The Hotshots have been around a long time and have been a premier program in AZ for a long time.  If any of the people who are running this program happen to read this, you may want to tell your coaches that as long as your team is wearing its name on their shirts they should act with some class.  When my daughters played in college, the first thing they were told was you represent the school in all you do.  We told our players the same thing and that is why all of my seniors received scholarships to play at the collegiate level.  They could play and they were respectful and had class.  There is more to being an athlete than just what happens on the field.  This team was an embarrassment to your program.",

    "text": "I'm a little conflicted in giving Aunt Chilada's a rating: I've been to the restaurant many times and would possibly say it's my favorite Mexican place to go for dinner (not that I've been to too many Mexican places since I just moved here and my boyfriend is a creature of habit).  The main problem is that the food has been a disappointment more often than not.  Love the hand shaken margarita, which comes with your choice of top shelf tequila and a floater (we usually go with Cointreau).  The flour chips are also really delicious, even if they're not authentic Mexican.  I was iffy on the salsa at first, since it has most of the garden thrown in (olives being the main rogue ingredient), but it's really grown on me over time.  Don't have too many recommendations on entrees.  The fajitas are ok and come with enough to take home for lunch or dinner the next day.  Pretty much everything else I've had has been a failure: greasy, oily quesadillas, dried out machaca and chicken in enchiladas, a chili relleno that was 75% breading.  Thing is, by the time I've enjoyed my margarita and some flour chips out on the awesome patio, I don't need much else to make me happy.  Two stars for an indoor experience, four stars for the patio.  Average it out for three overall.",

They have a great menu selection of all different types of entrees along with a great kids menu which is always a bonus because I have a 7 month who eats whatever I'm eating and a nine-year-old. I ordered the shrimp fajitas so much flavor and very fresh. My son ate quesadilla chips guacamole rice beans.. also he got a hot fudge sundae that was bigger than his face.

I will say the server did a great job and was above average. Hostesses, like usual were young and on their phones the hole time. Manager was not present on the floor touching tables to check in experiences. When we checked in I left my card with the hostesses and told them I want to pay since I have family from out of town visiting . They told me they would make sure the server knew. When the server came back with the bill my sister visiting from out of town handed him her card. Little did I know the hostess forgot to give him my card so she actually paid. How embarrassing. The manager with frizzy black curlyish hair late 50's returned my card tossing it on to the table saying they thought you turned in a lost card then bolted off and never returned. First of all if that were the case then apologize that things were not handled correctly and hand the card back instead of tossing it into the queso bowl on the table. Secondly, re-run the transaction and make it right. Our entire table was shocked that leader of the restaurant would ever act like a 4 year old throwing customers belongs into food the way she did and then run off. She was at the table less than 15 seconds. We will never go back and never recommend anyone to stop in. I saw the 3ish star reviews before taking my family out. I guess this less than mediocre restaurant is perfectly fine with the low rating the way they train their lazy managers.",

Be sure to read the history on the menu as this place is 125 years old!  A couple minor issues: we really needed a candle on the table as it was quite dark and we had to use our cell phone lights for ambient light. Also after visiting Straw-free Sedona it was frustrating to see plastic straws in every water glass. Sure wish restaurants in Phoenix would eliminate plastic straws as they end up polluting oceans and lead to death of seabirds and turtles.",

I wouldn't say it has been out of this world over the top fantastic only because the past couple of times I have been there, I have sensed a lack of genuineness in the servers enthusiasm.   Moral among staff members doesn't seem to be the absolute greatest, but it is not all together bad either. I think it likely may have to do with the many stressors that come with working in the high-demand \"pointe\" resort setting that they do.    One thing they get a definite thumbs up for is that they offer employment to the permanently disabled. I have seen them folding napkins and preparing place setting on more than one of my visits. I think this is wonderful especially having worked for the Social Security Administration for as many years as I did & being that a portion of my career was spent as a disability claims representative. I know that often times the abilities of our disabled community often go under estimated. Way to go Aunt Chiladas!   Right about now, you're probably wondering, \"Okay, but how's the Mexican food, right?\" Marvelous! Admittedly, it's not the most authentic you'll find in Phoenix, but they offer their own blend of American & Mexican options and their own brand of delicious. Thumbs up from me.",

They arrived sizzling and this chicken was tender and easily got tucked into the hot flour tortillas with all the usual fixings. We might have already been full from eating those deep fried flour tortilla chips we found in the opening chips basket.  Those received great reviews as did his sour cream enchiladas. Some tables are a tight squeeze to sit inside, but just get a table because the food is worth the visit.",

When it did arrive it was wrong and bad.  Owner came over to argue everything was fine Server finally came back to bring bill. Asked if they thought a discount would be added. Told nope.  Have to say  last few times quality has gone down hill. Highly unlikely after all these years well be coming back any time soon. Plenty of good Mexican restaurants around.",

We were looking forward to the frosted flake crust, but supremely disappointed with the result.   The live music was dope. Would have been nice to have karaoke also.   *my friend would give this place 3 stars, but the additional star is only because it's close to her house*  Overall, not the worst experience, but not great.",

I was stuck in the area for a full two hours at around 1pm and decided to have lunch at walking distance from the endodontist I had an appointment with.   It was hard to find the entrance, and almost gave up. Hint: it's on the back parking, right next to an old car husk.   Once inside I was the only brown person, including the staff, which felt odd but I kept going. Walked to my table in the deep part of the semi-huge building (it's not a warehouse but it's very nicely divided to give you a sense of spaciousness) and sat next to a fountain with tons of silk flowers instead of water. Why am I telling you all these details? Because...  It's how this food is best described. It looks strange, and like it may not work. But once you experience it, the whole thing clicks and takes you, not to the same boring Fauxican food taco bell, but to a place where flour tortilla chips marry an almost sweet salsa (with black olives!!!), right before the entree chicken melts along with all the cheesyness around it and yet their house made of a chimichanga shell (complete with a fideo backyard) remains crunchy and soft and expertly seasoned in all the right places.   People seem to love working here, and why wouldn't they? They work in the Disneyland of magical Mexican food.",

The \"mild\" salsa has corn and olives in it, (who does that) and it had no spice at all, and left a bad after taste. The hot sauce was not any better. The guacamole was very good. We decided we didn't want to chance ordering a meal, so we paid for the guacamole and the beer and got up to leave and on the way out the hostess, who I think is one of the owners with a raspy voice, asked how we enjoyed the food, and she evidently didn't really want to know the the truth because she became indignant so we told her if she didn't want an honest answer she probably shouldn't ask the question. On the bright side the waiter was extremely nice and understanding but I don't remember his name.",

The prices I think are a little inflated for their attachment to the Squaw Peak Hilton but as a regular you figure out that the flour chips and salsa fill you up VERY well and a couple of cold beers/margarita's go a long way with an appetizer and can be considered a meal.    There may have been (very) few slip-ups over the years of visiting thus the 4 outta 5. But I have to admit we had our wedding rehearsal dinner here in the back room and they handled everything exceptionally from the whoops, we need another table, to wowing my new family here in AZ as well as my family from back east with great food and sopapillas (yum!), as well as keeping the margarita pitchers filled all night.  The outdoor patios and gardens make this place feel as though it's your own back yard, keep up the good work Aunt C's!!!!!!!!!!!",

My dinner partner had the fish tacos (1 fish and 1 shrimp) - enjoyed both but would choose the shrimp only next time.  I had the fajitas - mixture of chicken and steak - very disappointed...so much so that I only took one bite of a piece of chicken and one bite of a piece of steak and told the waitress to take the meal away.  The chicken tasted like a baked / microwaved chicken breast that was then sliced and put atop some vegetables (no green peppers at all).  The steak was slices of a lower end cut of beef - cooked rare as there was blood oozing from the slices.  No grill marks, not seasoning, bland taste and very poor presentation.  I ate the condiments (guacamole, salsa, sour cream beans - still could not figure out what the ramen noodle type stuff was).  The tortillas were tough and stuck together - severed in aluminum foil.  The chips and salsa - which is complimentary for each table - was so/so....a mixture of chips with some being what one would expect (salty, crisp, not greasy) and others that were very thick, soft and buttery / greasy tasting.  Overall it was a poor experience for me and I would not return.  Shame - just moved into the neighborhood and it's only a couple blocks from my home.  Note:  they did remove the fajitas from the bill.",

Sit outside and you're surrounded by a cute bar, plenty of seating, music and lush greenery that just makes you feel like you're in a Mexican Cantina. I think they even had bocce ball. The margaritas are great and the food is good too. No complaints here.",

HOWEVER....the buffet was set outside on the patio where it was freezing so the food was cold and gross.   Why would you put uncovered hot dishes outside. Sternos cant keep up with that. I guess starving students are less likely to notice cold food??  I would rather pay than eat that buffet again.  Makes me wonder how their regular quality and care to food temps is.  Not excited to try that again. Cute outside space, games and places for dogs. Spring may be a better time to enjoy this venue",

I only ordered drinks and had some chips and salsa. Drinks were good but the chips and salsa weren't great. The server seemed annoyed I wasn't ordering food, but do you blame me with my past experiences? I had a taste of my friend's cheese enchilada and vegan black beans the staff is so proud of. Not impressed.  Yelpers please keep in mind that some of the 5 star reviews you see posted for Aunt Chiladas quite possibly may be an employee. How do I know this? Because I got a message from an employee after my last update. She said that she knows which bartender I am talking about that was rude at my HS reunion and said \"he is really great, just not for banquets.\" She also said \"I do not know why any server would yell at you, that is just ridiculous.\" And my personal favorite \"And yes, there is bacon and lard in our re fried beans. I have no hispanic background, so I am not sure what is traditional. But they are pretty tastey.\" But then she says \" With that said, I really hope you come back.\"  Direct quotes. And this employee has a glowing 5 star review for Aunt Chiladas and she says nothing about being an employee. Isn't this breaking some sort of Yelp rule? And what business does she have messaging me unless she is a manager?   Sorry but I wouldn't trust any Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area that has less than 4 stars. There are many better choices.",

    "text": "I really wish I could put 4.5 stars, because I usually don't put five as a rule, reserving that for mind blowing experiences. But, it's earned a special star, and it's a good 4 anyway.  My husband and I eat here regularly, and often stay up very late.  This is only place open late at night, anyway near us.  That deserves a star. Most places close at 9.  If you call to order take out at 8:45, some won't even take your order.  I'm from Chicago, even in the suburbs, there are usually places open during the week, at least until ten.  The food here is, for the most part, outstanding, gourmet, & good Mexican, but it's a fusion.  Familiar with good Mexican food, like I said, from Chicago, even visiting/eating in Central Mexico, such as in Michogan, it has only a slight similar quality.  But, unlike most \"anemic,\" and Americanized Southwest food, this stuff is full of flavors. They have as an appetizer, what I called 'flautas,\" they call them, taquitos? Those are awesome, probably the closest to authentic Mexican street food.   The salsas, the ones you pour over certain dishes, and the generous portion they give you of fresh salsa is delicious, again, Americanized, but not \"weak,\" as with most Southwestern food I've tasted. The seafood enchiladas and quesadillas are amazing, packed, stuffed with seafood, scallops, shrimp, etc. and do not taste fishy.  This place is on the pricey side, yes, but they give you a lot of food.  I would say you could split it, and you could, but the food is so good, you are going to want to pig out, seriously, I love to share my food, but when I eat here, it's mine! The flan is really, really good.  The people are kind and nice so far.  This is a favorite restaurant for me. I did eat here once for breakfast/brunch, and that was very delicious.",

Needless to say, we've been on the hunt for the best Mexican restaurant here in the Phoenix area since we moved here 2 months ago.  Our criteria is simple:  (1) Margaritas, (2) chips and salsa, and (3) food and fajitas.  (1) Margaritas --  Thumbs up!  So far Aunt Chiladas has the best Margaritas I've had in the valley and we've been to quite a few places including Tee Pee (where the food is good but the Margaritas suck).  We ordered the hand shaken margarita and its a pretty big serving with lots of the good stuff in it...  (2)  Chips and Salsa -   Thumbs up!  The chips are unusual in that they are flour not corn and come out nice and hot.  We liked the salsas and I love black olives so the fact it was in the salsa was a big yum factor for me.  (3)  Food/Fajitas - Thumbs up!  We ordered a few different things including the Chingalingas (yum!), steak fajitas, and enchiladas.  We also really liked that they give noodles (fideos) with refried beans instead of rice.  Those are awesome.  The steak fajitas were the bomb  The only downside is the service is just way too slow.  I mean, we waited and waited and waited.  They were nice enough but bring a pillow because it'll be a while!!",

The chicken fingers looked a little scary, and the quesadilla had very little cheese on it (the part my 1 year old will actually eat).  My chicken fajitas were fair, at best.  The guacamole was pretty good, as were the refried beans.  I have no idea what the Mexican rice was all about - it looked like cut up spaghetti noodles with Mexican spices in it.  It was not rice.

There was actually almost nobody there when we arrived mid-afternoon, but the outdoor seating area was so cool, and the bartender so warm and nice to chat with, that before we knew it we'd been there several hours.  It was a Saturday, so it picked up a lot as the night went on.  The thing I liked best was that there were several \"locals\" (of all ages) who go there all the time, so it was kind of like everybody knew everybody, and even if they didn't know you yet, you were still a friend.  Sitting at the bar, people were having conversations with everyone around them, beside them, across from them, wherever...whether they knew each other or not.  It was that kind of vibe.  A lot of fun, but in a chill way.  I'd like to come back with a bigger group of friends, this would be the perfect next-stop after spending a day sipping cocktails on the lazy river at the resort.  And I see now from other reviews that I'll have to give the chips and salsa a try when I come back.  So yes, then I guess I will need to come back.  There, it's settled.  I will be back. :)",

Our group waited over an hour for our meals to arrive and during that time our waitress only came to the table once to take drink orders.  No one should have to leave their table and go to the bar to order a drink.  The one time our waitress did come by she said there was a mix up with our order.  When it finally arrived 3 of us asked for side of sour cream.  Unfortunately it never came.  Luckily for our waitress we had a large group so gratuity was automatically added to our bill.

The food was still tasty, however: I had the chicken mole, DH had the chingalingas, and the kids each tried a mexican choice off the kids' meals. Our server, Sara, was awesome - she offered to switch out one of the kid's meals when he complained about it being too spicy. For the record, he ate it all and said it was delicious.   We've eaten there before and decided the best place to fully enjoy this restaurant's fabulous atmosphere is out on the patio so go when the weather is just warm enough to dine al fresco and when it isn't crowded with a private party.",

It's really a perfect atmosphere to pretend you're in the Yucatan swilling Tequila in the jungle if  you like that sort of thing...  They have these fantastic flour chips & salsa that come with your drink- I can eat a whole basket of them before the main course arrives. I always get the taco's and they're consistently good, not great. They make strong margarita's. They have a chocolate fountain on Sundays too.  Oh yeah, this is another place you can bring your dog onto the patio.  BOTTOM LINE:  Great neighborhood Mexican, one of AZ's best patios!",

The place looks old and outdated, especially for a hotel type restaurant.  We were seated out on a back side patio which was fine until BIG winged bugs arrived after we ate.  Anyway, the frozen margaritas were good and I ordered the Street Tacos, which were okay but the beef in them could not have been cooked anymore as it was tough and not very tasty.  Chips and salsa are pretty good.  Our group of 7 all ordered different things and no one had had rave reviews or bad comments about their dishes. We ordered flan, fried ice cream and sopapias (sp?) for dessert, which were all polished off.  I live in the Valley and given the multitudes of very good to great Mexican places we have, I don't need to return to Aunt's.",

About 10 years ago the consierge at our hotel recommended Aunt Chilada's for great Mexican food. We have been going back for lunch ever since. We fly into Phoenix, have lunch at Aunt Chilada's, then drive to Scottsdale. We always look forward to their great salsa and chips, especially the flour chips. Last year I ordered my regular taco salad and was very disappointed when it no longer came in a flour tortilla shell. My new favorites are the fish tacos and chile rellenos off of the lunch menu. This place doesn't necessarily have the best mexican food in the country but the outdoor dining, pleasant atmosphere, and very cold beer on a hot day, always hits the spot.",

I'll give em credit for the 'Pancho's on anabolic steroids' thematics, the patio is very comfortable, and as night falls on Spring, there is almost no better place to have a Dos XX or Pacifico.  Its lervely and shaded and filled with mostly professionals hitting on their secretaries, which is pretty amusing to casually observe.    As the US National Drinking Circuit Holiday, 'Cinco de Mayo' (eh, que?) approaches, I guess this would be a relevant time to inform of their festival, which consumes their parking lot and is actually less of a tool collection than most other forced holiday festivals.  Entry last year was about $10 with booths for drinks and food.  I didn't hate it, got fairly leathered, and left feeling it was money well spent.    If you must visit Aunt Chilada's North, I'd hold off on the food and stick to the cocktails.",

I ended up ordering the fancy shmancy hot dog which you can personalize. I asked for guac on mine but didn't get any. It took about 45 minutes to even get my hot dog and I was so hungry I wasn't going to let that thing out of my sight.

We asked for a candle for some light- \"We're out of candles, I guess we're not doing candles on the tables anymore.\"  The guy graciously removed the umbrella from the table which helped a bit.  It was downhill from there.  Slow service on drinks, constant creepy lurking interruptions from the waiter, condescending comments during 2/3rds of the tables orders.  Snooty oblivious help from the woman who brought out our orders.  (If the people you're sending out with food can't answer simple questions with anything better than a blank stare, *MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T BE CARRYING OUT THE FOOD*)  Continually empty water glasses and slow service to the end, I left satisfied only in the knowledge that I will never patronize this restaurant again.",

    "text": "My husband decided to take us out for lunch and he picked Aunt Chiladas. The decor is so cute right when you walk in, very cheerful. We went for lunch so it was quieter. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. Now the best part....the chips! They were delicious, some of the best chips I've ever tasted. They weren't greasy or over-salted, but so good. I had the machaca taco salad which wasn't served in a taco shell so took away some of the guilt from eating all those chips. It had a scoop of their guacamole in it which was also delicious and creamy. My husband and son had the beef and cheese enchiladas which were served in a delicious red sauce. The regular side is a pasta called fideo, but they opted for the traditional rice and beans. I loved the food, the atmosphere and the service was good too. Definitely coming again.",

    "text": "My favorite part about this place is the chips they bring out for the chips and salsa. They make their own flour tortilla chips. Yes, flour. The texture is a fun and an interesting change from the typical tortilla chip. They do throw in a few regular chips, I think to fill out the bowl and satisfy those who like normal chips and salsa better.  Their salsa is good but I am not a fan of olives in my salsa. Seems like a odd addition, but easy enough to eat around.  If you go on the weekend they have a free chocolate fountain between 10am-2pm. The first time I saw it I thought it was an odd compliment to a Mexican food meal. But hey, it's chocolate... So do yourself a favor and have dessert first. You want to make sure you have room, right?  They do offer a free \"buffet\" during happy hour. It used to be better and more offerings years ago but it's still nice to have complimentary food to munch on during happy hour.   Good food. Standard Mexican fare. Not a huge fan of the enchilada sauce, which I keep forgetting since I typically get a burrito \"enchilada style\". But I keep coming back for those delicious chips and forget I should get something different from my usual.",

    "text": "We went to this restaurant for a group meetup.  The restaurant was very good when it came to reserving and setting up our large table.  We enjoyed being in the company of others.  That said, the food was sorely lacking.  Their chips and salsa are supposedly \"award winning\".  In all fairness, the mild salsa was unique.  It had a wide range of ingredients in it and was  tasty.  The spicy salsa was indeed spicy but there was nothing about it to make it stand out from other Mexican restaurant salsas.  The chips were unusual.  Some had the consistency of a deep fried pie crust.  In other words, they were very flaky.  Yet others were like chips found in other restaurants.  For my drink, I ordered a frozen mango margarita with salt.  The mango flavoring was faint and there was very little salt on the glass.  For dinner, I had a combo plate --- one chile relleno and one chicken enchilada.    The dish came with refried beans and \"fideos\" (noodles with a meat sauce).  The chile relleno was the worst one I've ever had.  It held together very poorly.  For example, when I was less than halfway through it, I cut off a piece with my fork and out came the entire remaining chile!  What was left was the batter and the jack cheese!  The chicken enchilada was generous with the chicken portion but pretty forgettable.  The fideos were certainly a unique touch and pleasantly flavored.  The restaurant was very good when it came to accomodating those in our group who were vegetarians.  They were willing to substitute sides that had meat in them for a vegetable side dish.  Service was friendly, prompt and helpful---no complaints there.  That said, I certainly won't go back when I'm in AZ.  Without going into too much information, the whole meal left me with a bad case of indigestion.  There is certainly much, much better Mexican food to be had in the Phoenix area!",

If all you want is a couple of drinks and a couple of small plates of free mediocre tacos - then by all means, knock yourself out.  We wanted an actual dinner so we went to the other side of the restaurant to get a real table away from the happy hour crowd. And there we sat, with nothing but chips and salsa, for at least 25 minutes. Two different servers took orders and attended to other tables within view and not one person even acknowledged our existence. When we attempted to get their attention, we were ignored. We finally got up and left and went elsewhere.  Based on the menu options and the quality of the food at Happy Hour, I'm willing to bet there are probably a dozen other Mexican restaurants in the area that offer better food and service.",

The place had a few parties going on, but as usual it seemed under staffed. So my friend and I sat down and we were given chips and salsa and a bottle of water. About 5-10 minutes later a family came in with small children and after about 5 more minutes or so all of sudden a waiter comes out and looked me right in the eye and went to the other table and took their order. Turned around and went back in to the kitchen. Of course this pissed me off. We got up and hostess saw me I explained what happen she said it was her fault. That did not make it OK. The waiter should have said something to us and didn't. So we left Aunt Chilada's in discuss and went down the road to Ajo Al's for a awesome meal and great service..",

We eat out often so are aware of numerous different restaurants, type of food, prices etc. We decided to reserve a table here knowing the facility was large and could accommodate us. Unfortunately the food was TERRIBLE, my kids who eat just about anything didn't want to eat, I don't blame them... I ordered chipotle chicken which was far from chipotle it was a nacho cheese sauce, with almonds in it and man was it TERRIBLE, the corn tortillas I requested split the second you tried to put anything in them, the beans and rice were beyond bad... my son got chicken tenders and fries that we're cold, my husband who ordered nachos was told there was chicken on them, and requested no jalapenos and when they came out had beef and diced jalapenos. The prices are WAY over priced. I paid $50 for my daughter and I to share a meal, two kids meals and nachos. I am very disappointed I wasted my birthday dinner here and am embarrassed I even brought 17 people along with me. Didn't get a happy birthday or anything of that sort either. Everybody I asked in my party about their meals said the same thing, we left majority of the food there, it was that bad..... sucks I have to take the time to write a review like that but something has got to change we will continue going to our normal Mexican restaurant that actually deserves our business. Such a shame, learn from our mistake, don't waste your money.",

It seems there used to be a mine nearby that contain mercury and the miners would return from their shift a little woozy and in a dream like state, thus the name. They have a nice outside patio to take advantage on warm days. I thought the food was ok, but others felt it was too bland.",

    "text": "My family has been going to Aunt Chiladas for about 30 years. My mom had her last meal here before my breach baby self broke her water about 8 hours after her dinner. I have probably had almost everything on the menu and have yet to find something I didn't like. Little did I know, this place would get even better once I turned 21. Their hand tossed margaritas where you pretty much build your own margarita are AMAZING. All greatness aside this is not necessarily your home cooked Mexican food but it tastes good and has an awesome atmosphere so if you are looking for \"authentic\" then I'll send you down the road to los taquitos or el bravo. Also I've noticed multiple people complain that they don't have rice. They do have rice, you just have to ask. Otherwise, you get served some yummy fideo which is almost like tiny noodles and mixed veggies. I personally love the fideo but if you aren't expecting it, it's weird. They also have a really good and fun happy hour on the back patio and have bags set up.",

My meal was acceptable. My wife thought the chicken encilada's were the worst she's had ever. Big chunks of chicken and didn't care for the rice and beans. I tried hers and she was correct. Salsa is just ok and didn't get the room temperature water bottles on the table. Probably won't go back to eat. The outside and the area around is very nice. It's pretty sad when food on the west side gets a better rating than this place.",

We were a party of 12, making a reservation was easy and Aunt Chiladas confirming system was through Yelp, so that was kind of cool.  Chips and salsa were provided, and the chips were mix of flour & corn tortilla chips, which we all liked. The salsa was mild and had good flavor. You can also ask for a hotter sauce if you like it spicy.  I ordered one of the house specialties, the El Pollo Fundido, it was a chicken chimi topped with cheese and jalapeno cream cheese and came with fideo and refried beans.  When the plate 1st came out, it looked like the cheese was over cooked, but when I started to cut into the chimi I noticed that everything was perfect.  This was good meal, and I liked that they serve fideo over rice.  Service was great, she was friendly and made sure our table was well taken care of, and didn't mind most of us were on separate checks.   This Aunt Chiladas is a great location, nice patio area and seating inside as well.",

We were seated quickly, but the service was extremely slow. It almost appeared that the waitress was the only one on staff inside, which is not fair to her considering how large the interior is.   The food also took 30-45 minutes to come out. Our drinks only get refilled once despite them being empty. The only thing that was prompt was the chips and salsa being refilled.  The prices are extremely on the high side for what the food is. $15.50 for three street tacos is ridiculous.   I would skip this place next time it rolls onto your mind. Unless you're only coming for the chips and the Sunday chocolate fountain-stay away!",

It was nice that they could also accommodate family of 7 at one table. The waitress herself seemed to disappear for long periods of time, we were left sitting for quite awhile, debating if we wanted to wait half an hour for dessert and then wait another to get the check.

I bumped it up to 3 stars just because of our long history of visiting this location. Unfortunately, it has lost a little mojo over these past few years. The service was slow, especially for being half empty at 5:30 on a Friday night. Chips were very good (we had a whole basket of flour ones) however, the salsa was super chunky (huge uneven cuts of tomato & onion). I even like it chunky but, they cuts were too big to fit into a bite, plus the flavor was a little bland and lacked any heat. Ingredients were fresh, just poorly put together. We probably waited almost 30 minutes for one app and one combo plate to arrive. The Chingalingas were luke warm at best and seemed to be just thrown on the plate haphazardly. The combo plate (tacos, chili relleno, spinch enchilada)  was a heaping pile of food, beans, & rice but, again lacked any bold flavors. We were very underwhelmed. Our server stopped by maybe 4 times total in over an hour (including dropping off check). That was kinda a bummer for a nearly empty room. We stayed for drinks at the bar and a good local band but, I have to say its a tough review to write since we are looooong time customers (my wife and I actually met here), unfortunately this location may be best for drinks and not so much for the food anymore.

We are watching the National League Championship Series game 6, so part of the crowd is very glued to the TV.  Busy place, but everyone seems to be very happy, bobbing heads, applause and many smiles.  Oh, and cheese pizza is free with a drink on Friday!  Thank you for the time Tiffany!",

And also, your salsa was good and your hot sauce. But your food lacks flavor of any kind. Your chicken was over cooked bland and old (must have been 10 days old). And no, I'm not the only one who thought so four others tried the chicken at my table and agreed. Also, your steak cheese crisp had 3% cheese. Your food is really not worth $13-15. May try again to give another chance but with the prices I doubt it.",

They are great, but for some reason for the first time ever , I found my fresh chips mixed with thin non fresh..   I ordered the spinach and chicken enchiladas ... I do not recomend.  Chicken was aged and tough, there was barely any spinach. The sides were very luke warm.. There is just no culinaryism.   Sorry to lose you as a great mexican restuarant, but I do believe their glory days ended a while back when N'sync broke up. ..Nothing here screams order me and take the left overs.",

Water - You'll also need to ask for water. These servers aren't so advanced.  Chips and salsa - They brag about their homemade chips . But they're only on the top covering a pile of Tostitos.  Queso- Too soupy. Not a traditional gooey queso you expect. Don't worry. They have spoons. But you'll need to ask your server.  Million Dollar Margarita - For a $25 margarita, THIS IS NOT WORTH IT. Way too sweet. They skimp on the booze. Just overpriced.   Booked a reservation here for dinner. But will be having our main course elsewhere  If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, this ain't it chief.",

The owner greeted us at the door and warmly welcomed our nine-top.   The chips and salsa were popular among my team just not with me. My chicken burrito on the other hand absolutely crushed my hunger. It is a wet burrito with tasty beans and cheese.   Service was on point. The atmosphere is pretty typical Mexican restaurant just larger, warmer, and slightly more upscale. I heard that the seating was up to 700 people. It was hard to believe but maybe it is True. The next time I am in Phoenix, I would love to come back. It seems like a killer spot for a night out with friends and cold margaritas.",

Since it's on the Dreamy Draw cycling route and very close to the Arizona Canal cycling path, a fine place to stop and lunch if one's on a ride in the area. The flour chips and salsa were delicious, the fish tacos and the pollo fundido were yum, and ice cold Modelo amber is on tap! Service was fast and attentive - my one complaint is that while a bottle of cold water hit the table immediately, water glasses never did appear.  I suspect that milady wife and I will become regular clients. Food - three and a half stars, service four, and ambience a solid five.",

And though it was nice to have a bowl of hot salsa and another one of milder, the mild one had olives in it instead of just being a good salsa fresca.  The combination platter was good, but I forgot to tell them I wanted black beans and rice instead of refried beans and those noodle things (fideo?). My fault for not telling them, but it would be nice to be asked, when it is an option on the menu.  Which brings me to my third point, the service was pretty bad. Guy at my table asked for a second beer, never got it. Salt was delivered on the glass of a margharita even when it was requested not to be. It took forever for them to even take our order.  The best thing is that their outdoor patio is really nice, when the weather is good, especially.",

Let me say, how excited I was at the idea of Mexican food at the Christmas party. Then my vegetarian instinct kicked in when I got there....hmm....lets check for lard. I asked the waitress who was going around...slowly I add but it was a busy night so maybe the service is faster when there isn't a huge event going on. (I'm thinking understaffed?....hoping?) Anyway, I was then informed that they cook their beans with bacon. What? Yes. Bacon. So there went the idea of a burrito, a tostada. Depressing. I ended up eating the very \"ehh\" chips (deep fried tasting and thicker than the typical chip. I'd venture to guess possibly flour chips?)  I'm not a big drinker so the allure isn't there for the bar aspect.  I will honestly never be back and from what the people who actually did eat there said I didn't miss anything.",

A dream you never want to wake up from. The place is huge there are two outside patio and inside room where live music happens on Fridays. Beside it's natural beauty on the outside it wouldn't mean anything if it had no substance. The people are what makes this place gold. They are unique, laid back, classy (most of them) and bring a positive upbeat, mature vibe to the table. From bar tenders to guests it's a lovely way to spend my Fridays after a long week at work. I recommend this to individuals who want to get away into a paradise but stay here on earth. To people who want to eat best nachos ever and wash it down with a ice cold beer. For a great night out look no further then Auntcheladas!",

The Taco De Jeebus just wasn't amazing. Have had much better pork tacos in Phoenix.  - Service at dinner was 1. The guy actually said to our friend \"wow, you're a clean plate club member!\" C'mon Spiffy, you don't say that to a lady, regardless.   - Beer was a 4. But it was over priced.  - Too many damn families with babies with what appeared to be \"baby SARS.\" If a kid is yacking up straight clear goo, ask the family to take them out of the dining room. By the time we got done eating we were surrounded in Mormon family hell. Maybe they think that Chilada's is Kolab, but sweet little baby jeebus, keep on your patrons so they're not spreading disease.  Where it really went to hell in a hand basket was when we went into the bar...  Maybe it was because we were with our bald Mexican friend Mario. Maybe it was me with my tattoos hanging out of my Brooks Brothers shirt. Maybe it was my pretty girlfriend. Maybe it was Mario's wonderful wife.  But they never came to serve us at our table. Everyone else got table service, but it ended up with Mario and I having to sherpa back and forth from the bar with our drinks. The service really, really sucks in the bar. They weren't busy, the bar wasn't slammed, the 12 pieces of jail bait bar maids were just too lazy to attend to everything.  Won't be going back.",

Seating has never been a problem any time I've gone.  The place is HUGE.  It gets a bit loud on live music nights, but that's really to be expected.

    "text": "After a strong recommendation from my foodie co-worker, my husband and I tried Aunt Chilada's. I had to talk him into going, as the Yelp reviews were so mixed. This one time, I will admit that my husband was right (ha!). We were seated quickly and given shot glass-sized glasses for water(really?) and chips and salsa. The flour chips were tasty but the salsa was standard, with the exception of black olives. Yuck. We proceeded to wait for 15 minutes to have a server even approach us for drinks, with many tables being seated and served well after our arrival and before we even got a \"hello\". NOT a good first impression. Our waiter finally arrived and my husband ordered a house margarita which I was so jealous of as I rubbed my pregnant belly. He said it was \"just okay,\" and was seemingly quite watered down. He ordered ground beef nachos and I got a combination plate with a cheese enchilada and a chicken taco.   My husband received the wrong order and had every meat imaginable on his nachos (and was later charged too much, as well). He said that the nachos were average tasting, with the chicken and ground beef being tasteless. The shredded beef that was also on there supposedly had the most flavor. My enchilada was pretty good with good taste and flavorful sauce, but the taco was horrible. The chicken was not seasoned and extremely overdone, and didn't seem to be fresh. It had a horribly unappetizing texture, as though it had been recooked in the microwave and dried out the pieces so that it was hard and stale. The refried beans were fine but the fideo was flavorless, cold, and didn't go with the meal at all. When I think of Mexican cuisine, I want some delicious rice, not noodles. Too bad they don't offer a side option.   Although the food was not good, I would typically give any place a second chance. However, the poor service has cemented the fact that we will never go here again. Drinks were never re-filled, we weren't checked in upon, and after asking for our check and a to-go box for my husband's nachos, we had to wait another 10-15 minutes. Sadly, we had a view of the kitchen door, where we watched our server stand and joke around with co-workers during that wait. He then brought the check (which was incorrect) and a box for the table next to us but not one for us. We said forget it and left with a bad taste in our mouths (literally).",

I was a little worried that the kids that attended the event would be bored, but this place is perfect for ALL ages... if you have it out on their beautiful patio, there is so much to do for everyone!

The Street Tacos were tasty as was the guacamole appetizer. One in our party order a vodka tonic and the tonic was flat, same for the replacement drink but that can happen to anyone. The food was tasty and serving time was about 10 minutes. Grab a seat in the outdoor courtyard and watch a Bocci game while you dine. Tina Ann took good care of us and was friendly and engaging. Good prices and a pleasant dinner.",

The customer service was sub par they said my table would be ready in 30 minuets and I had no problem with the wait. Although, 40 minuets have now passed and I started to get fed up. When I got to the table it was disgusting, there were crumbled chips everywhere what seemed to be sticky residue was covered all along the edges of the table. To top it off the waitress was rude, never coming back here! Catch me over at the Taco Bell",

    "text": "I've ridden by this place countless times on my way to and from the trails in Dreamy Draw. Always seemed pretty packed, so we stopped in for lunch to see what it was all about.  The building itself is great, old school and huge. The only other restaurants I've seen with seating areas this big are the buffets at the larger properties in Vegas. Love the padded bar and fixed stools. Good amount of TVs for sports.   Service is awesome. Bartender was super friendly, attentive and helpful.  Drinks are great. Had a few really good margaritas, and I'm a sucker for easy to drink Mexican beers on tap. A bit pricey, but this is a tourist haven. It's expected.   However, the food is what kills this place. I knew this was a by-the-book TexMex place going in (large boat-like plates of different combos of the same 8 ingredients smothered in sauces, cheeses and beans), but even with those low expectations, I was very unimpressed. Menu is giant, like a chain restaurant trying too hard; think Chili's meets On The Border, only executed more poorly than that. While the portions were large, what we had was bland, uninspired and unidentifiable.It truly is a feat that someone in the kitchen was able to cook every bit of taste out of our food. Flavorless beans, chicken, cheese, veg and sauces. I guess they anticipate that the resort tourists would be scared off by food with flavor, and maybe even some spiciness...   Also, pass on the chips and salsa. The chips aren't normal chips, and have the texture of drywall, and probably taste about the same, too. The salsa is utterly flavorless and has black olives floating around in it for some reason. Ick.   Overall, a great space with great service that is sadly producing bland, shitty food for those that apparently lack taste buds. Shame. We won't be back.",

I think there was a wedding and a quinceanera going on along with at least 3 birthday parties. This place is definitely festive and we had a table next to the bocce court. The cocktails are ok. Margaritas are made with mixer instead of fresh squeezed lime. The food is solid mexican. I had the fajitas which were ok. It was kind of a mash up of chicken, peppers and onions. I am used to fresh al dente veggies(broccoli, carrot, squash, peppers and onions) and this was not that. Great for kids - after dinner they can root around the treasure chest for a treat.

    "text": "My family and I were staying at the nearby Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort and after a day of pool-hopping, we were really craving some Mexican food and an ice cold margarita. We Googled and found Aunt Chilada's. The name made us laugh and the food looked great in the photos so it was a go.   What a great place! It was just what we wanted: Good food and cold drinks. They were quite busy but we were seated right away. Service was prompt, friendly, and accurate. The food was great! The enchilada sauce was our favorite and we ended up ordering side orders of it to dip our chips (the flour ones are insanely good) in instead of the salsa. My mom even had a few spoonfuls sans chip right out of the little cup -- it was that good. I ordered a combo plate of enchiladas, beef tamale, and beef crunchy taco. My enchiladas (I had a cheese one and a chicken one) were delicious. The cheese was melty and gooey and the chicken, although a little dry, was still a good portion and flavorful. The tamale was good, but if I had to choose, I'd go for the taco every time. It was a good portion, juicy, crunchy, and fresh due to the fresh tomatoes and lettuce. Dip the taco in the enchilada sauce and OHMAHGAWD...   The margaritas were a little too sweet (the tequila was oh so right) but I mentioned this to the waiter and the second one be brought me was less sweet, so it's obvious they want to please their guests and are willing to make whatever changes are necessary to do so, which I appreciate.  This place was exactly what we wanted. No, this is not fine dining, but it's better than Chili's or Applebee's could ever hope to be and we felt good supporting a local establishment.",

We also never tried the Spanish pasta before which was served instead of the usual rice. It was softer and more delicate than the rice but just as tasty.

    "text": "Awesome family owned Mexican restaurant. It's the perfect mix of good food, good ambiance, indoor and outdoor seating, and 4 bars!!! The frozen margaritas are amazing, mostly tequila. I had two and was basically drunk, I had the blueberry and prickly pear, amazing. My husband has the chicken burrito and I had the seafood burrito with shrimp AND scallops, the sauce was very savory. Instead of rice they have noodles, which were really good, they mix well with the burrito/enchilada sauce. Plain they're kinda bland but still an interesting twist!   Amy was our waitress and she was very attentive and nice. The bartender also complimented my husband and I on how cute we were and told us we should be bartenders. I loved it",

Chicken enchiladas should have shredded chicken, not perfectly sized large cubes. Also, instead of providing rice, they provided chopped up angel hair pasta with some weak spices to it.  If you're in town looking for REAL Mexican food, please do not go here. It's cute inside and on the patio, and you may spot some parrots, but your tastebuds will be disappointed in you.",

    "text": "Ooohhh Boooyyy!  When the star align, they really do align in our favor.  We had no reservation on a Friday night, and they had parties galore going on. The private parking lot was full. Parking on the street was also full for at least a mile. There was NO chance we were getting a table any time soon.  Wrong!   After navigating the throngs of people waiting to get a table, we made it to the reservation desk. We asked for a table for 2, and she took down my name. She summarily informed me that it would be over an hour's wait.   No biggie! I was with my Beloved. Waiting was not an issue. We weren't that famished, so we could easily keep ourselves entertained playing games on our phones.  We happen to find an open spot right by the reservation desk. Five minutes later, the Manager comes over to the desk. She looked at us, we smiled back. She then asks if we wanted to be seated now!  We were in shock! What? Ummm...you know that we've only been here for 5 minutes right. The rest of these folks around us have been here for I don't know how long.  But, who are we to argue? We followed the waitress, as she led us past the other patrons with the puzzled looks on their faces.   They seated us at a table right in the middle of all the revelry, and we quickly got acclimated to the \"fun\" crowd.  My wife had the Burrito and Relleno, and I had the fish taco and the machaca enchilada. Both dishes were excellent. I think the only thing we didn't really like were the chips. They were an odd mix of flour and corn tortilla chips. We pretty much only like really thin, warm and crispy, corn tortilla chips. Other than that, everything was excellent. There was just too much food.",

Friday night during the \"outdoor \" AZ season they offer free wood grilled pizza with beverage purchase, what deal!! They have a very large, green and accessible outdoor area and bar.  The bar inside is very spacious, the bar itself seats about 12-15 but they have several tables and TVs in the bar area. Ordered.... you guessed it Enchiladas! Seafood to be exact. They where excellent. Shrimp was large/fresh.  Only thing missing was crab, but they do state shrimp and scallops in the description. Wifey ordered fajitas, excellent flavor and portion size.  Only one reason for 4 stars and not 5, my personal preference on salsa and chips. They add olives to there salsa. To each there own, but no bueno for me. Overall this is a must stop and eat place. Excellent food!!",

    "text": "Lovely patio garden with real plants providing shade and ambiance. Despite this, we sat inside in. datk corner where the light coming in from the window made it hard to see the menu and the food because of the strong, uneven glare.   We waited for our waitress for so long to take our drink order and later our food order, that I had to look at the menu again to remember what I wanted to get. She was pleasant and good about refilling our drinks though. She also handled my friend's special request of no peppers with her fajitas. In fact she asked to have them on the side so my mom could have them. They were delivered as promised.   My friend ordered fajitas, but her flour tortillas were never delivered to the table. A server from another area stopped by to say that he would bring them out after he helped our waitress deliver food to our table, but he never did.   The salsa was chunky, mild and hearty. We asked for hot sauce which we added to the salsa to give it a bit more of a kick. It was still very mild, but an improvement.  My chicken and spinach enchilada was standard affair. The most unique thing was the side of FIDEO instead of Spanish rice. Fideo is a Mexican pasta dish. The noodles are small and thin which makes it easier to scoop up with a fork. No need to twirl your fork. They are light and the sauce coats each bite without overwhelming the main focus of the dish.   This would not be my first pick for a Mexican restaurant, but my friend suggested it and paid for our meal. I might return under the same circumstances, but more than likely I would suggest an alternative the next time, especially since it will be my turn to pick up the tab.",

Aunt Chilada's, ladies and Tex Mex loving gents is your local Phoenix inspired hash house serving up run of the mill grub to any and all that simply don't know any dayum better or are too famished to complain!  #fix-it-Jesus  Located this joint whilst pitching a tent at the nearby Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak.

The chips, consistent of both flour aNNNNd corn tortillas - were an unexpected surprise; just not a good one.  ***** Think, that one hot guy/girl you take home after a sweaty, lust filled night out at the club.   Sure, they were cute beneath the strobe light after a handful of Patron and Jager shots but BAY-BEHHHH, .....waking up next to a pillowcase full of Revlon and previously glued on eyelashes (or melted \"Just For Men\" beard coloring, provided it's a guy) is the numero uno indication that you've been catfished by a plate full of Arizona tilapia!  Why, Lord? WHYYYYYYY????  I'm SERIOUSLY going to need for this place to perfect one craft prior to switching things up.   The salsa was Pace Picante' at its finest and the burrito tasted microwaved; a total \"No No\", if you ask me.   Thereon nothing ....... and I do mean NOTHING says, \"Home of the Phoenix Suns\" like mooning your boss as you bolt to the nearest bathroom stall for an unforeseen caucus of jungle squirts!   Ohhhhh. Mylanta!  Customer service was fair ......well, it was when our server wasn't perfecting Houdini's \"disappearing act\". The fastest part of our meal was actually when she magically made our check appear!   Abracadabra and this brings me directly to my verdict.  As it appears.....  ***** Another disillusioned reviewer alleged this place to be the \"quintessential Phoenix experience\".   HUNNIE' .....if this is your perception of quintessential Phoenix, then you and this town both need to rest your swamp cooling shart shooters as you have, NOT ONE but SEVVVVERAL SEATS and locate some SERIOUS air conditioning - STAT!   I'm starting to suspect heatstroke!  Aunt Chilada's, .......consider yourself nixed from my Will and Last Testament. Right about now, you're lucky if you still get a darned Christmas card!

Seems like they are trying to figure out where they should land on this. - Overall the food was kind of bland for me. My group had a lot of left overs, but in a way that they didn't seem to like the food much. - Food took quite a while to come out - not a big deal since we were chatting anyway, but I could see this irritating others. - Pretty overpriced for Mexican food in AZ. Most items are $15+ on the menu. Cheaper & better quality options around. - Felt sick a few hours after eating here...granted this could be from anything.  Would be cool if they refreshed the menu/cooking. I really want to like this place!",

A wait at the hostess stand, while having several employees/servers etc. walk past us without acknowledging us or anything got annoying after several minutes..Was ready to go find a table ourselves when finally a server came and took us to a table in the dining room.   I had the Avacado Salad after my server recommended it..which was interesting! It was dressed with a pinapple sauce which had a little kick to it, however it would have been better if the salad wasn't swimming in the sauce!    It was ok, but not as impressive as I expected it to be..",

Hokey decor and ubiquitous gringos that come with any american-mexican joint; but maybe it was that I had come in with a huge (15+) group of people and was in generally a good mood from straight chilling on the next-door Hilton's lazy river that framed it positively.  Big restaurant is big: no problem seating everyone, huge outdoor patio, chips and salsa constantly flowing.  Had a Corona light and said to hell with counting calories tonight - it's time for Pollo Fundido, something filled with chicken and jalapeno cream cheese that there is no way you can finish in one sitting.  Came away sated and generally happy with our servers and the copious amounts of beef/chicken/cheese/tortillas/more cheese that everyone at our tables got quickly and pretty tastily. Just get rice instead of fideo with your entree.  Good for what it presents itself to be.",

    "text": "Did someone actually refer to the salsa as Ketchup?! Oh hell no!! The salsa and chips are by far the best I have had in the valley. I was surprised this place got such mediocre ratings. I have been going here since I moved to the valley and it's always reliable.  The location is great because it is so different from anyplace else; Mexican or not. Tucked back of 16th st in a more residential area, the patio is great and there is always room even when it's busy.  The service is always good and then there is the chips and salsa. I don't see how anyone can knock it, it's always fresh. The more pico inspired salsa is chunky and has a good amount of cilantro. The hot red salsa is more of a paste but more authentic and delicious with some heat. The flour tortillas chips are always warm and delicious. Most of the time I load up on chips so much I just get a Tostada and a beer or house margarita.   When I used to eat chicken and dairy the chicken chimi fundido was something I always went for. I get the veggie burrito on occasion now but that isn't anything great, it's got plenty of veggies but nothing to write home about(if my home was in Mexico). The veggies in it aren't what I think of when I think Mexican, it has carrots, cauliflower, etc in it. No peppers, onions, etc.....oh well.  I would just give it 3 stars if I didn't love the chips/salsa and location/ atmosphere so much. That bumps it up a star in my book.   Salsa is like ketchup? Seriously? Sorry...I can't let it go.  Oh yeah, for awhile in 2008 every time my girlfriend and I went here it seemed there was always a wedding party, high school reunion, or other annoying large group gathering. In 2009 we haven't seen as much of it but be warned, you can usually still dine, but half the place is reserved and you have to deal with horrible band or MC music and exhaustingly obnoxious people.",

To their credit, I walked through an incredibly great patio, perfect for Arizona winters, on my way to the main entrance.  But it reminds me of Tortilla Factory in Scottsdale.

We were made to pay for inedible food and no attempt was made to make things right...

We asked our server if each table could have its own tab, so it would be easier for us and them to figure out at the end....they said no. Lovely. Luckily there was an atm in the bar area so we were able to pull out cash.   The food came out faster then expected with such a large group. Mine was decent, though I ordered a cheese enchilada and they gave me chicken and never came back to ask how our food was :( BUT I also ordered a green corn tamale AND a beef taco (Leave me alone, I worked all day and was hungry as all hell) Those were both way super tasty.   I do have big beef with their chips. They suck. Who wants flaky not so crispy chips for dipping in salsa...not me. I want my chips crispy, thin and crunchy thank you very much.   The margaritas were good, they got me sauced.   I wouldn't ask to go back, but if someone suggested going, I wouldn't put up a stink. Its ok.",

The flour tortilla chips are pretty damn good and addicting. However I've noticed a suspicious discrepancy in torilla chip ratio lately, they seem to be hiding more flimsy corn chips in with the flour. Very sneaky and lame.  And Fideo? Yuck. Uh no pasta with my mexican food please, I'll stick with the rice.  If anything, get drunk and enjoy the wonderful patio on a nice day.

It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks and mine came out incorrectly. For a slow period, communication should be on point.

Since we had called ahead and let them know that our group would be there at 7, I was hoping for, at least, good service.  Unfortunately, the service was really slow. More than once, someone from our group had to go find our server and request service.  Ugh!  While the conversation from our friends really kept us entertained, it's kind of sad when the server can't seem to remember why she came to work (make money?)  While I didin't personally try one, the consensus was the margaritas were more like tequila shooters with fozen ice thrown in - which is fine if that's what you're ordering.  Would we come back?  Maybe - if we have other friends staying locally.    Would I recommend it?  Not sure.    Plus Side:  Great patio with sand bowling.  Would be a great during the winter months.",

The beans were bad, they tasted as though they had just opened the can and poured them on the nachos.  I asked the waitress for some flour tortillas because I believe that flour tortillas tell you a lot about a Mexican restaurant especially those who claim they are authentic, homemade.  Their flour tortillas were AWFUL!!! She gave me like 3 or 4, they were all stuck to each other and these flour tortillas were not homemade.  I have bought some from the store that were way better. Don't bother with this place.",

It is a bit hidden of the beaten path but Yelp & iPhone map took us right to the front door.   The patio is really interesting. It was a bit chilly for our taste, but others were bundled up and enjoying the patio. We sat inside near the fireplace.   The chips & salsa were good, not the best, but not the worst by far.  Three of us shared fajitas and our son had a cheeseburger & fries, very authentic \"Mexican\", only my son!! The burger didn't last long, it must have been awesome because he had already had a basket of chips on his own. We enjoyed our fajitas, our daughter has been on a fajita kick for about three months now. Guess its less expensive than the Prime Rib kick she was on the eight months prior.   We had a nice evening, but Aunt Chilada's is a bit far for us to drive for Mexican food.",

Very few people present, but it took our server more than 10 minutes to make first contact. \"I didn't know you guys were here\", I believe were her exact words. Sat outside, and it was nice but a little on the warm side for me. Scavenger birds were everywhere, landing on the tables and even plates (used & unused) looking for food. When diners left, birds immediately converged on their table and started eating. There is something very disconcerting about a blackbird eating sour cream off of a half-eaten burrito... I digress. I had the seafood burrito which was very good. Rice & beans were no better or worse than other restaurants in this class. My friend had the chicken sour cream burrito and also said it was good. Our table was very unstable, and it took more than one request to get something to shove under the \"short\" leg to stabilize it. Overall, not bad, but I probably will not be back.",

Then, I had some White Russian...nasty stuff.  Hubby was smart to chug beer instead.  The freebee food bar consisted of chips, beans, salsa, hot wings, tamales and cheese enchiladas (chafing dish of the last two was empty).  Should've ordered food instead.   I decided to forgo the fruit and veggie platter with flies feasting and buzzing around.  My son asked me to Google \"What do flies do to food?\", I decided that I don't care much for fly vomit.  Aunt Chilada's should invest in acrylic food covers!  Several round of shots came out.  The extra star is for our server's awesomeness.  I had to have some ginger ale after that and guzzled some water.  After all that I had to go to the outhouse...it was like a sauna in there!!!

The chicken and spinach enchiladas were bland but the seafood enchiladas were very good, containing shrimp and bay scallops.

We all sat out on the patio, which was nice. They gave us chips and salsa...the salsa was a little odd (had olives in it) and the hot salsa was not hot, tasted like slightly spiced tomato sauce or something. The chips were really good though, they were fried flour tortilla chips, not the typical corn. They also give you a free trip to the chocolate fountain, which was pretty good. The fruit was fresh and the chocolate was....chocolate...seriously, can't go wrong there. With breakfast, I got a mimosa which was only 3$, so that was pretty good. It was nothing special tasting, but it was cheap and alcohol. For breakfast I got the benedict with chicken. This is where they kind of went wrong. The chicken was dry and did not seem to be cooked fresh, or if it was, it was overcooked. The eggs were messy, the person poaching them let the whites go all over so it wasn't one cohesive egg and the eggs had slid off of the chicken by the time it got to me. The hollandaise was ok, but nothing special...it is supposed to be jalapeno hollandaise and just had maybe a slight spicy taste. The plate came with some dry looking beans that I did not eat and some potatoes that were nothing special. The BF got the pancakes, which were dry and tasted like they came from a package. I wouldn't say 'no' if I were invited back here, but I wouldn't come back here for breakfast on my own. I would like to come here for drinks one night as their patio is nice and they have a bocce ball court (which is awesome!), but I probably would pass on the food.",

We met there today for lunch & it was gorgeous out so we sat on the patio.    Our waitress was Chelsie & she was really sweet! We started off with the chips & salsa. So damn good, the best we've ever had for sure! We decided to get an appetizer, although I regret it now because the chips & salsa were an appetizer in itself! Any way, we got the standard cheese quesadilla with sour cream. It was ok, too greasy for us. For our meals, my Hubs ordered the chicken fajitas & I ordered the shrimp tacos. They offer fideo & beans for sides but it didn't sound appealing to us so we got rice instead. We were already stuffed from the chips & appetizer so we hardly ate our meals but the few bites we did have were yummy!  Overall we liked it here & will definitely be coming back! Maybe even for Cinco de Mayo which our waitress told us all about, sounds like a lot of fun. Either way, next time I come I am getting a margarita & dessert ;)",

Their decor is fun and their Happy Hour is nice because they have a free chips / salsa bar available.    Last night, I ordered a Blue Moon I think it was 22oz for 6.50 and a Sour Cream Chicken Enchilada for about 6.95 (off of the a la carte menu)  and sat watching 2 baseball games with my hubby.  There were a few people at first around 5pm and the service was pretty fast, but as more and more groups started showing up the service was slower because it was just the two of us and the waitress had to deal with about 2 / 3 groups of 4 - 8.  I totally understand being busy, especially when our food came out fairly quick in the beginning, but the meal itself was ok.  I think it is a fun place to be and their chips and salsa are good, but for food I think you will just be stuck with an ok.",

This is a family business and the food is the best. Also has a huge bar business, so the place gets super busy, but great food and great fun.",

They were smiley and friendly. But our food was just okay.  My dad ordered a dish that was supposed to come with peppers and onions and a bunch of stuff (maybe a burrito or something, I can't remember). What he got was fine, but later that night he realized it definitely didn't include all that the menu had described.   I had a \"special order\", I asked for just tortillas on the side, and chicken and onions. When I got my food I had tomatoes mixed in with my chicken and onions... it wasn't a big deal, they were small pieces, but still... I thought it would be easy since I'd specified. Besides that though, my food was lukewarm and the foil-wrapped tortillas weren't even hot.   My mom's food just didn't show up at first. Apparently they had some issue in the kitchen or something... the waitress acted quickly and the food came a few minutes later, so the issue was resolved.   The best part of the meal, in my opinion, was the warm tortilla chips they serve. Chips and salsa, yum yum!   Overall though, the food was okay, some of it was warm, some of it wasn't... nothing special about it though. Just a good dinner. Average.",

They immediately try to upsell you their premium margarita because it's a better deal, but in the end, it's expensive. I'm a $2.99 rita fan @ Via Delosantos or Mi Patio.  The food is quite good and of course, portions are huge. The only thing is they serve this weird pasta side dish instead of rice. Bizarre.  Always have good servers and everyone is friendly.",

On beautiful weather the patio areas are great to be hanging out! Sundays- awesome brunch with a chocolate fountain. Margaritas- frozen, on the rocks, top shelf, etc- love them here! Chips and salsa- love the flaky, crispy chips here! Not a real fan of the chunky salsa( I like mine hot!) but you get two kinds- the chunky and a red mole style which is spicer so me likey! Grreat  place for groups!!! And the patio is dog friendly! For Cinco De Mayo- come here! All day live music fest!! ps, the inside is more intimate for dinner, I am a fan of the sour cream and chicken enchiladas! I love coming here!!",

It was about 9 o clock when we got there and the place was packed and music was loud, not too loud but enough to set the vibe. Luckily the place is huge do we were still able to get seated right away. Service was good and consistent and the food was delicious. My wife had street tacos and I did a shredded beef chimi w/ red sauce. I would recommend both. They had plenty of beer options to choose from from and a solid Margarita. They have a lot of Tequila options so of course we took a few shots as well. Had a great bar tender who comped a few shots for us to try out as well. Good night and good food. Worth a shot wether your at the resort or not.",

I sat down and for 30 minutes not one person came to my table. Not for drinks, food order or anything. Finally when someone came to my table, I explained how I sat for 30 minutes. Sheepishly, he apologized. I had to leave. No time for food. He offered me a to-go water. No manager came to apologize. This was NOT a busy day/time. I will NOT return. BUMMER",

They have food for free at happy hour and all sorts of interesting margarita options... My favorite is mango. Of course, it is also a restaurant and not just a bar.   I have to admit that the food is not the best Mexican food out there. Some of it is pretty good though. I like their fajitas, beef chingalingas, shrimp tacos and green corn tamales. Their real claim to fame is their chips. They bring a huge basket of both corn and flour chips... The flour chips are not like any other chips I've had anywhere else--they are thick and soft and crisp all at the same time... their mild chunky salsa is also really good.  But, I have been thoroughly repulsed by their fish tacos which were soft and squishy and weird.   Overall, I like it here and come back often, though  now that I have found items I like, I rarely try new things.   This is the place to be on a Friday night and I highly suggest you come for happy hour.",

Me & my husband would like to thank Michelle for being so helpful & friendly. She was able to get us in with only a month's of notice. She made our wedding reception as easy & simple as possible & she was always available for any questions & concerns. And for the 2 bartenders, sorry I didn't get your names guys but just wanted to extend our thank you, you were fast & very much attentive. Overall, I love the place, great atmosphere & definitely will come back for more. To anyone looking for a unique mexican restaurant Aunt Chilada's Sqaw Peak is highly recommended..

I only wish smokers weren't allowed on this same patio but thankfully it was only one individual.  They start things off with a basket of chips and salsa. The flour tortilla chips are fantastic. I could sit and eat and entire basket of them and skip ordering an entree all together. The salsa was mild which is perfect for me. Both my husband and I had the pollo fundido. It wasn't bad but I have had it made better elsewhere. Our other diners enjoyed the chicken fajitas and the taco salad. They said their entrees were delicious.   The service was good and the ambiance lovely. We will definitely be back for more chips and try some other items on the menu.",

Aunt Chiladas was the only other restaurant I could remember in the area within 30 min drive.   This was our 4th time together at AC; my 6th time throughout the years. The food has not gotten any better. It is not anything close to being Mexican. Bland, smothered in bland cheese sauce with a rice-a-roni rice mixture not Mexican rice. Bland salsa. Maybe people who rate it higher either like their bar alcoholic drinks or are visitors from states that don't know Mexican food.   Again the ambiance is nice if you are looking for a restaurant with walking distance of the hotel resort.",

Only complaint was a reservation we made and still had to wait an additional 20-25 minutes. Hosts didn't seem too concerned about it.

I will say that their flour nachos were scrumptious, and if you find yourself there, grab some.    Our food was nothing but soggy tortillas slathered with melty cheese.  No seasoning whatsoever.  We were on vacation from New York and we had better Tex-Mex there.  I only hope we can find the real Tex-Mex or actual Latin food in this area.    Also worth noting the wait staff was not very good.  Our hostess and waitress both served us in regular old street clothes and did not look professional at all, and their  demeanor more or less matched it.  They checked in on us only as etiquette required and disappeared as soon as we wanted something.  The only saving grace was a nice youngish waiter who helped us out even though we weren't his table.    The rating says it all: don't settle for Aunt Chilada's,  at least not on Monday nights.",

    "text": "Fan-friggin-tastic!! SO, I met a petit blond young lady at work one evening/early morning. Miss Jami told me about this wonderful establishment. She shared a brief history of the place which really peaked my curiosity. She says she's a server there and that I must try it sometime. The sucker for a pretty girl that I am, I made a commitment to try it on Tuesday. I did.  I loved the antique car in the front as I approached. I love the overall character of the place from the outside. I walked in and waited for a moment for the host, and just took in the beautiful entryway. The smell of that old wood gives hint to the age of this great place. The host returned and greeted me. Kyle was pretty laid back and calm. He was a gentleman and very kind to spend a few moments talking to me. Being by myself, that was a bit of hospitality that I love to receive at restaurants.   While taking up Kyles time my server came and asked me for my drink order. This lovely creature calls herself Mari. Mari was great. great personality, attentive and lovely as can be. While waiting for my food, I gawked around at this beautiful 1892 masterpiece. This restaurant has great ambiance, and I was thrilled to be dining in what was once a horse corral. In this corral was a beautiful fireplace, built in the 1930's, I'm told, and a huge water fountain. Very pretty. I love the paintings on the wall, one of Aunt Chillada herself and another awkward one, but fun, nonetheless. While nearing the end of my meal I greeted Daisha. While she was setting up the table next to me, I struck up a conversation with her, because that's what Thought Creep does when he dines alone. Daisha was fun to talk to and how awesome, she cleared my dirty plate. I love the team work. Uncommon in other restaurants. So a shout out to her. On my way out I was thanked by the Manager on duty, Dan. Kyle had offered me a History Tour of this massive place earlier but guests were starting to come in about 5:30 pm so I thought I'd take a rain check. Nope!!! An enthusiastic Dan offered to take me on the tour. He really knows his history of this place. I was impressed with, not only his knowledge of Aunt Chilada's but local mining history that played a roll of it's earlier success.   Overall, I am really impressed. I am sad that Jami wasn't there, but I will be back another time. But TC, you ask? What about the food? I had the two entree combination platter. A sucker for red meat and carnage, I chose the Machaca Taco and the Machaca enchilada. Served with shredded lettuce, lightly spiced refried beans with, what tasted like, a hint of fresh garlic, and a side of a seasoned baby angel hair pasta with bits of peas and carrots. Preceding my meal was home made flour tortilla chips and a delicious Salsa Fresca with baby black olives and other tasty bits of Mexi-goodness. And finally, I was impressed with the bottle of water. Served in a bottle that looks as old as the structure itself, this bottle was served extremely cold. The frostiness of the glass and light blue hue made this water appear refreshing. It was, at 110 degrees outside.    I absolutely loved my experience here. From the moment I walked in to the time I left, my experience was a grand one. I will be back. I've told my friends back home in SoCal this is a must try, while visiting Lil ol' me. Until next time. Thank you Aunt Chilada's crew. Nicely done.",

Mark Mulligan (\"Mexico Mark\") was playing wthe last time I went. He's awesome! I asked the bartender for the \"best margarita you have ever made\" and got a $7 margarita that couldn't have had any tequila in it because I felt absolutely nothing. Hence- the clothes stayed on that night and Mark did all the entertaining.",

    "text": "After my review is a History of Aunt Chilada's from their site- excerpted:  We went for lunch Saturday around 11:30am. A Group of 6 adults. My wife and I visiting from Denver, the  rest live in the area. My son recommended the place and we went with him, his wife and their Realtors. We thought the restaurant was nicely decorated, they have an area for bocce ball play, they say they are dog friendly. My wife liked the lit fireplace. When we arrived, there was only 2 or three other parties there for lunch.  When we left, they started filling up. Guess we need to leave a place more often to help the business :-)  What we Ordered:  Soft drinks for everyone.  Sour cream enchilada, El Pollo Fundido, Two item combo, Lunch Rellano, Spinach Chicken Enchilada, Chicken Avocado Salad, Caramel Flan, Sopapilla (nice they served the honey in a small bowl with a spoon), Caramel Flan  We also had chips and salsa. Chips were a combo of puffy and toasted. Salsa was mild. Over all thought they were okay. I happen to prefer crispy chips myself.  Everyone thought the food was delicious, I had the Chicken Avocado salad, it was okay. I'm not much on Mexican food, and usually it doesn't agree with me, so I ordered a neutral dish.  I've ordered sopapllia before, these were triangular in shape, and I thought over done, and more chewy then I remember from other places.  Flan tasted pretty good.  The place seems okay, the Realtors, said they felt it was good and would try the other one that's in the area to see how it was.  I don't think the other Aunt Chiladas is associated with this one.  I think it would be a good place, and would try the other dishes, as well as come back some evening to see how it is.  We came because my wife and I always enjoy visiting places with a history.  Below is History of Aunt Chiladas from their site abbreviated:  Shortly after the reluctant surrender of Geronimo (1886). Arizona was still an untamed territory, and Aunt Chilada's North Room was built on the foundation of the only general store serving the laborers working the Rico Mercury Mine... After a long day deep in the mines, the men emerged appearing somewhat inebriated and dreamy-eyed from inhaling the mercury fumes. As they walked down the dusty road to the general store, people were heard to remark, \"The men are back from The Dreamy Draw\".  Following the repeal of prohibition, Dave and Jesse Noble, the land's owners at the time were granted the first liquor license issued by the State of Arizona.  The store was later reopened as The Peek Steak House, getting its name ..from a uniquely placed and somewhat revealing window set in the ceiling of the bar (now the Tienda). Throughout the night, scantily clad women would climb into the attic and perform a hootchy-kootchy dance while patrons sneaked a peek through the window.   This infamous bar and restaurant again found notoriety as it began a new life as George's Ole! George Cocherham was..a captain in the Phoenix Fire Department ... He used over 3,000 Santa Fe railroad ties, native stone from the area and a little help from his off-duty firefighter friends, George expanded the building to its present size.   George made one other important addition, he purchased Arizona's Original smoker from Gentleman Jim's Barbeque at the corner of 16th and Oak Streets, and moved it to the Garden Patio where he not only smoked traditional meats and fowl but would also smoke game animals brought in by his customers....  The same tradition exists today. Aunt Chilada's still slow roasts a variety of delicious meats, chicken and vegetables over aged mesquite wood every day....  In the early 80's, Bob Gosnell bought the restaurant, renamed it Aunt Chilada's and made it a member of The Pointe's growing family of restaurants. It became known as \" The Hideaway\", by the locals...   Ken was the overseer of food and beverage operations.... in January of 1995 Ken along with his partner, Lee Midtun, purchased the restaurant.  The Nagels - Ken, his wife Candice and their four daughters - now greet and serve guests.",

We came specifically because the chocolate fountain is included w/ brunch. Quite honestly, I couldve done w/out it. A bit too sweet, but the fruit was good.  Our large group was seated on the patio, thankfully, while the patio weather was still bareable. Our waitress was a bit slow, which was puzzling considering we were one of 3 tables in the entire place. She did a good job keeping all of our checks straight though.  They have a good number of selections on their brunch menu. I chose the Mexican eggs benedict over the traditional. This one comes w/ chicken instead of Canadian bacon. It was really good, though Id go for the traditional next time due to the dryness of the chicken. The hollendaise was seasoned nicely though, and the eggs poached perfectly.  Id definitely recommend this for a brunch spot, especially if you have a major sweet tooth.",

We were staying at the Hilton down the street and when we arrived, we were quickly seated.  Service was prompt and quite friendly. Our drink order was taken almost too quickly has half of the table hadn't looked at the menu yet. I tried a lucky (something?) margarita and it was delicious ($7.50). I had to be sure to stir it often though as the agave syrup would settle. Beer was served nice and cold and my Mom enjoyed a (tiny) mimosa. It was disappointing to hear that all of their margarita flavours were syrups vs real juice, especially as an entire page of the drink menu is marg options.  Food wise, my dad and I each enjoyed the combo fajitas (steak and chicken) and my mom and husband had combo plates. Portion sizes are definitely ample as none of us managed to finish and we definitely didn't leave hungry. Meat portions on the fajitas were very tiny, as I was down to onions and peppers after my second tortilla. I enjoyed the fideo pasta vs traditional rice, though consistently have an issue with mixed peas and carrots being added. They overcook and shrivel to sad little rocks.  Overall, we enjoyed our meals. Not sure that we would rush back for food, but the outdoor patio definitely looks like a nice place for drinks on a hot day.",

I had not been to Aunt Chilada's in years and we randomly were thinking of places to eat in that area and thought why not?! I remembered the house made tortilla chips being the best ever (and they still are, and they still put regular ones underneath).    We ordered our drinks right away (a 22 oz beer and a margarita).  It was at least 10 to 15 minutes before we got them.  One guy was actually getting up from his table and just getting their drinks from the bar (it was not very busy, it was about 2 in the afternoon, so the lunch rush was over). When the drinks came, the beer was only a 16 oz, but who cares at that point, we were just happy to have drinks.    When we ordered lunch, I asked for a high chair for our son who was still in his stroller so he could eat as well.  They never brought the highchair and with the other things already done wrong, I just let it go, he was able to eat his quesadilla just fine (that they also charged us the full price for, not the children's - and again for $1 difference it wasn't worth the wait I knew we would have to mention it).  I ordered 2 stuffed poblano peppers.  I was served one. It was however, delicious and plenty big enough that I still brought some of it home.    My boyfriend just ordered a carne asada burrito, which came out fine, it was nothing spectacular, but decent.  As mentioned, my poblano was very tasty and a good sized portion.    We waited for the bill for quite some time as well.    So overall, the food was exactly what I remembered, tasty and a good variety.  But the service was terribly slow.  We'll go back when we can just sit at the bar, it seemed a better spot to be and much faster.  I enjoy a lazy lunch at times, but the long waits and errors for a simple lunch for two was terrible.",

My friends who were getting married got a nice mexican buffet set up with a open bar. As you would've figured, we all got wasted and ate a bunch of food which was pretty delicious. The decor was pretty nice but unfortunately it got a little dirty since the only time the marrying couple had was during the summer to get married and it turned out that it was going to sprinkle a little bit preceeding a heavy dust storm. Dust got everywhere since it was an outside venue and since it's Phoenix during the summer, you can imagine the heat though since it was afternoon, it wasn't entirely as bad as if it were during noonish.   The wedding procession was really nice. I arrived fashionably late but just in time for bar open and proceeded to drink heavily. They had rented the venue until about close time and before kitchen closed, I was hungry again because I'm a fat ass and ordered another enchilada meal which came with rice and beans. It was pretty delicious. Pricing was decent.   All in all, a good time. Outside of the venue area, in the bar and band area, people were drinking and listening to live music. I guess this place gets pretty packed with people during the weekend.",

Who puts black olives in their salsa? Maybe this is some sort of Tex-mex thing. But as a native southern Californian in love with Mexican food, I have never experienced such a thing.  3.  The fideo was super soggy.  4. My family went for lunch on a weekday.  There was some sort of work banquet going on in a back room.  There were possibly two or three other families eating in the other main rooms.  Our server seemed to be working hard..every time we saw her.  Unfortunately, there were times that she disappeared for way too long.    5. Half of the orders placed had something wrong with them.  I ordered black beans and was given refried.  Every family member with a chicken dish complained that the chicken was drier than wood.  My sister ordered a salad with chicken and received one meat-free. We didn't ask for corrections, because considering how long it took for us to get any food, we would have had to wait to dinner to receive the corrected meal items.  6. The wood bench, manikin and old blanket in the entry way sorta smells like musty cat urine.  I think it is long overdue for a cleaning.  7.  I have been to this restaurant many times over the years. I was sad that this last experience was so marginal. Overall, the food was okay--worthy of three stars. The prices and quantities were good.  But the inaccurate orders and the lacking service (which I think comes from being understaffed instead of bad skills) drop this place down to a two.  I will update my review when/if I ever return.  Until then--go only if convenience dictates that this is the best place for you (you are staying at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak resort without a car), and go with the expectation that you will be there for a long time.",

The ambiance of the restaurant is very lovely and not too fancy. We went around 8:30 and string lights were hung outside giving the restaurant a classy look. When we got to the hostess she said it was going to be a 30 minute wait, but we only waited about 5 minutes! Chips and salsa, along with the menus, were handed out very quick. Our waitress was very polite and kind! She said if we didn't like something, we could return it for something else (wow)!!! Being from Texas, NOTHING beats Tex Mex so this place was more of a miss for me. I ordered chicken tacos, and they were not bad! The beans and rice had a wonderful spice to them. I would recommend this to anyone in the area for a quick, but nice meal.",

    "text": "Every time I have come to Aunt Chilada's I've had a great time along with some delicious Mexican food. I've tried their fajitas, enchiladas, quesadilla, torta, taquitos, and even the fired ice cream (don't typically get dessert at Mexican restaurants) and all have been very good. For what it's worth, I once went with a friend who doesn't like Mexican and she said Aunt Chilada's had one of the best burgers she's ever had. I can't vouch for that though. I recently tried the El Pollo Fundito and it was awesome. Probably about 2000 calories, but awesome.  This place is huge! Lots of indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor patio is my favorite on a beautiful spring evening. Great happy hour. A perfect place for group events. Live music on Friday nights. Trivia on Wednesday nights. Bocce Ball outside. Friendly staff each and every visit. Nice view of Piestewa Peak!  I really don't get some of the negative reviews of this place. Each of my dozen or so visits to Aunt Chilada's have been very positive and I will continue to return.",

    "text": "For me, the food is more important than the service so the unfriendly staff has never bothered me. I've been going here about once every two-three weeks for two years. The food is always fantastic so they deserve a high rating!  Food: The food at Auntchiladas is close to authentic, but that isn't necessarily their goal. They serve a variety of dishes, like the chipotle chicken and the fish tacos, that are somewhat Americanized but are still very good. The el pollo fundido and chipotle chicken are my favorite dishes. The beans aren't loaded with lard so they are not very fattening and the rice is excellent. I order queso or abondigas soup for an appetizer. The free chips and salsa are great!  Service:  This is where Auntchiladas loses many of their customers. To be fair, we have had some fantastic servers, but the majority of servers have been rather unfriendly. The food comes quickly, but don't expect to have time to fully enjoy it. If the restaurant is packed, the waiter will rush your meal by continuously trying to take your plate. The female servers are often dressed to attract attention. We have been at the restaurant on afternoons where all of the women were dressed in bikini tops! This destroys any attempt at a family atmosphere.",

But, the staff here sets the bar high above any other place in AZ. I highly, highly recommend stopping in for dinner and then an evening on the patio.  Shout out to Sarah, Kimmie, Jenny, and Tina! These ladies are the best. Thank you so much for everything!   Yelp needs to add more stars for this place! It's at least an 11.",

I was thrilled to find out the rellenos were made with poblano peppers, not the much milder varieties that tend to be used in Arizona.

I couldn't eat the flour because they were so greasy.   The salsa had no flavor and contained black olives. Who puts black olives in salsa?  I ordered the shrimp tacos and they contained barely any shrimp but so much cheese. Also disappointed that they were in a flour tortilla instead of corn.",

    "text": "How is an establishment going to be so uncoordinated and inconsistent? One manager didn't have a problem with someone of the age of 20 sitting at the bar. Another manager said the age was 19 to sit at the bar. And then another manager argued that it was the Arizona Law that someone under 21 couldn't sit at the bar. Please tell me why I can pull up the Arizona Liquor Law and it states \"An underage person can be in a bar if accompanied by a spouse, parent, or legal guardian of legal drinking age, or is an on-duty employee of the business. The underage person can't drink any alcoholic beverages.\" I'm his spouse, and I'm 21 years of age. And of course, it's at a business' discretion, but if there is no sign stating that a person under the age of 21 cannot sit at the bar and 3 managers all have a different opinion on it? What is there to do?",

    "text": "Oh Aunt Chiladas, a True Central Phoenix classic! We came here with some friends who were having a staycation at the Pointe Squaw Peak and had a fantastic evening! We were actually able to sit on the patio in August due to their misters, we had great service, delicious margaritas, and food!   I went to order a house margarita but our waitress told me that the margarita shaker for $12 was actually better quality and you get two margaritas out of it (ends up being the same price as two house margs). SOLD! She was right, it was fantastic.   I love love their chips & salsa here. I always seem to eat too many before my meal comes! For my entree, my fiance and I split the chicken + steak fajitas that come on a sizzling skillet with tortillas, guac, sour cream, rice, and beans on the side. The marinade was delicious! It is a great dish for 2. I also ordered a house salad on the side.   All in all, we had a great experience here and would absolutely come back! They have a great Happy Hour and themed nights during the weekdays as well so be sure to check out their website for more info. It is also GREAT for groups!",

Now, I have only been here when it's been quite busy. I came here once on a Friday night, and I've been here twice for trivia night on Wednesdays. Today's review is specifically about trivia night.  I suck at trivia. Seriously, I'm terrible, but I go to surround myself with my awesome friends, who also suck at trivia -- just not as much! Ordering food during trivia night takes FOREVER. And the room that trivia takes place is in tiny, almost as tiny as the tables. It's really hard to eat, especially if you're with a group larger than 3. It's also quite loud. I was sitting right next to the trivia host tonight and could barely hear him.   The menu has plenty to choose from, but I haven't ever truly enjoyed any of the dishes I've gotten here. It's not bad, but it's also not good. I will say that their tortilla chips are great though. The salsa... not so much.  I'd probably come here for the drinks, but not the food. And I'd recommend sitting outside when it cools down. Their patio is quite lovely!",

It's still great for brunch, though. Especially on a warm day when you can sit on the huge patio. It's also nice when you can find room by one of the fireplaces for a drink on a cold night.  The staff is still friendly and the food is decent. Live bands most weekends. Go see the CPP play some night if you want to dance and sing along. Gail can sing the hell out of anything.

It has Bocce Ball, a band on the weekends, and good staff.  The service is usually good, with the exception of one rude waitress we had.  I took my mom here when she visited and we had a blast.  We drank, ate and danced to the band.      I also threw a surprise birthday party here for my fiance, Paul.  We reserved a part of the back patio and it turned out perfect!

The Cheese Crisp was pretty good.  The Nachos were very good as well....they heap the toppings on it as you can see in the pictures above.  Of course, I had to try an Enchilada....how could I come to a place named Aunt Chilada's and not have one?!  The Cheese Enchilada I ordered was very good, above average.  Our server was very attentive and made sure our glasses remained full.    We dined on the patio around happy hour on a Wed evening, so it was full of business people after work.  The vibe was very fun and the weather perfect.  Return Factor - 86%",

    "text": "So, I finally made it to breakfast club this morning here, and let me tell you, I really enjoyed both. I got to meet a new group of people and eat at a new restaurant, and I was extremely happy with both!  For starters, I got here at 10 am sharp, and realized that this place is closer to my house then I thought. I know they have a couple locations around the valley, but I think they have one in Tempe aside from this location as well.  When I arrived, the place was colorfully decorated and there were people slowly streaming in. I found my group, and we all sat on the patio.  Our server was super attentive, and I realized when she handed me the menu, that they had a weekend breakfast deal with healthy good looking food.  Yes, you can order from the main menu, but they have a great separate menu for their breakfast stuff on Saturday mornings.    The server informed us of the complimentary chocolate fountain with fruit inside as part of the Saturday morning breakfast thing.  After we placed our orders, I went inside and grabbed some fruit and dipped it all in chocolate.  They had strawberries, cantaloupe, marshmallows and a few other items to choose from.  So tasty!  I reviewed the menu and decided to go with the fruit bowl with granola and a $3 Mimosa.  One of the other girls with me ordered the same thing as well, and the others got some good looking dishes as well.  The fruit bowl came out and it was so good looking!  Holy cow! I really enjoyed the whole thing and overall, the prices and the food were awesome.  Service was great too, and I will gladly be back in the future for more.  Thank you breakfast club, you have made my day...and aunt Chiladas's",

It doesn't always happen.  And get rid of flour chips with salsa.  Corn chips are always better and certainly more traditional.",

Matter of fact, it's so far from typical that most of my friends questioned my insanity for even showing up on a random school night during twilight.  That said, it's really a good story but I shall save that for another time.  Not only is it tucked away in a very cool / scenic part of Scottsdale, but the layout is vast, expansive and impressive.  The patio has personality.  This is important when one lives in a place where outside dining is preferable for eight months out of the year.  The help / service were impeccable and everything I tried was tasty and affordable.  If you can get behind the culture and history of born & bred Phoenix family stories, this is one not to be missed.  I'll be back without question!",

I was staying at the hotel (great hotel and resort in general) and my friend was starving.  Instead of grabbing a cab and heading out to Tempe I was shanghaied into eating at this abomination.  My other friend who is the nicest most mellow person I have ever met who never complains about anything, pushed his plate away after a single bite agreeing with me that this was by far the worst Mexican food he had ever tasted.  The service was tolerable but nothing special and you are seated on a nice patio, but outside of those minor triumphs this place was an unmitigated disaster of a meal.    I swear on my deathbed I might remember how horrible my enchilada taco combo plate was and think it may have been the one regret I had in my life.",

The history of this place harkens back many years & is included on the menu - fun to read. The place has a kitschy atmosphere, and a nice outside area to dine. Located in shadow of the Pointe Hilton Hotel at Squaw Peak, the restaurant still draws many visitors. The night we were there, there were many large tables of guests that appeared to be from out of the area. I know, I'm jumping to conclusions, but locals know how to pronounce \"chimichanga\", \"quesadilla\", \"machaca\" and \"chipotle\"!  The carnitas tacos were boring and generic and the chicken burritio flavorless. Meh.. Margaritas nothing special. They claim to be \"always\" voted Best Margarita by a local magazine, but I find that hard to believe. The upside: the salsa is very flavorful. Not a fan of the flour tortilla chips, though.  Years ago we used to come here for the awesome happy hour on their outside patio, which they still advertise. Reduced appetizers during the week, free buffet on Fridays.   I doubt we'll be back. The Valley has lots and lots of places to get authentic Mexican fare. We'll leave Aunt Chilada's basic Gringo fare to the tourists and dine elsewhere.",

When we got inside there were a lot of open tables (must have been short servers). Hostess was bubbly and very friendly.   Our food server said she was relatively new and had very few suggestions as for best plates available. She rarely swing by our table. I think 4 times the whole night including dropping off the bill and picking it up.  Food review: I really liked the chips before dinner. I had the chicken and spinach enchilada. Was good but not over the top. I asked if I could substitute vegtables as one of my sides and was told yes. When I got my bill I was charged $3 for a side of vegetables. I didn't complain to the server because I think she would have struggled with adjusting the bill.   My wife ordered the fish tacos. She really enjoyed them and the tarter sauce was great.  My father had the burrito fundido as the only recomendation from our server. He said it was about average, not excellent but good.  My son had a quesadilla. How can you go wrong there?  Price: price was average. Not to expensive or cheap.  Would I return? I doubt it. I would find another place.",

We sat at the bar (as we usually do) for a couple cocktails and dinner.  The bartender was a younger women (early 30s), she wiped our spot down leaving in dripping wet. I asked if she could hand me a couple napkins so I could dry it and she waved the menu over it attempting to dry the counter top. When that was unsuccessful she tossed a couple napkins down and walked away. We ordered a couple drinks and as we sat there we watched as she overly fraternized with the men at the bar to the point of neglecting the needs of other patrons. However that was tolerable, even if inappropriate. As we sat there the worse was yet to come. When when of the other patrons order a large plate of nachos she began sampling from his plate (obviously she liked  nachos).She was taking the food with her fingers, from his plate and placing it into her month then cleaning her fingers in a \"finger licking good\" fashion, and continuing to wait on and serve other patrons. At that point we were done and left. In all the years we have been dinning at Aunt Chiladas we have never experienced such a horrible display of professionalism in the food serving business. Needless to say that will be our last trip to Aunt Chiladas.....",

The menu includes pretty standard items, tacos, burritos, enchilada's as well as some other specialties.  The chips that everyone mentions were OK. They are more of a puffy chip vs. the crisp thin chip you normally see with salsa.  For apps the table shared large tortillas covered with melted cheese, kind  of like a Mexican pizza and some guacamole.  They were tasty.  For entree, I got the sour cream chicken enchiladas.  The plate was huge.  2 large enchiladas covered in sauce and served with refried beans and rice.  They were good, but the chicken was a bit dry.  Others said the seafood enchiladas were delicious but I didn't taste them.  The chicken in chipolte sauce was good.  If I had the choice, probably wouldn't be my choice for for a meal.",

    "text": "OMG. Worst restaurant experience I've ever had in my 50 years of existence. Here's the experience went  1. Right out of the gate...Our hostess who seated us told us the fruit and chocolate fountain were included with the meal. My girlfriend grabbed two pieces of melon and two strawberries.When our waitress did finally decide to show up 10 minutes later we both ordered a cup of Albondigas soup without rice. She made a snotty remark that we should get the bowl of soup because the cups were small. She then barked at us that if we don't order an entree that we would have to pay $8 for the four pieces of fruit. I said whoa, hold on. We are ordering entrees. She replied that a lot of people come in just for soup. All of this is going on while my girlfriend and I are still reading the menu to decide what we wanted. I want to know what other people just ordering soup has to do with us.  2. After 30 minutes the entrees arrived. I complained that it took way too long and the waitress said they had a large party and that is why the food took so long. Mind you I ordered 2 enchiladas and my girlfriend ordered a gound beef tostada and it took 30 minutes...no shit. How hard is that to make? I told her that we are just important as any other customer in the restaurant. She sent the manager over and he said the same thing. Large party sorry. I told him I don't care about the large party. Not our problem. That was it...he walked away. I looked around and the place was practically empty.  3. I ordered beans and rice with my meal. The waitress didn't even have enough courtesy to listen to me. She brought me fideo (mexican pasta) instead of rice.She also brought fideo and beans for my girlfriend who ordered her tostada ala carte.and charged us for it. When my girlfriend ordered just the tostada the snotty bitch complained that my girlfriend wasn't ordering more.  4. After trying to eat what was very poorly made food (we couldn't eat it because it was horrible) we went to pay the bill and noticed extra charges. We complained again. This time the manager did not come to talk to us. He told her to tell us the meal was comped. Since we couldn't eat that crap, that was fine with me. My girlfriend was going to taste my enchiladas and without asking one of the bussers took my plate away.  5. Finally I asked to speak with the manager and a waiter called him (Marty) and the manager turned around and yelled across the bar that he was too busy. He LITERALLY yelled it. Then he noticed me standing there and said Oh, I'm sorry. I replied no I'm sorry that you are too busy. I told him I would never return. That was the last straw.  The waitress was a snotty bitch and never checked on us once except to give us the check. We had to ask other wait staff to get our waitress more than twice. If you are smart you will not waste your time or money at Aunt Chiladas. Over rated and over priced. This place should be out of business.  Oh and the Chocolate fountain is disgusting. I've seen people pick up the fruit with their fingers and cough and sneeze in it.",

They had already picked up the check and never pushed us out so we had a relaxing evening.  Unfortunately I was unimpressed with the food. The chips were light and crispy but the salsa tasted pretty generic. A spinach enchilada was very bland and a chile releno was mostly breading with a small chile and cheese but not much flavor. The two people who were with me agreed that their food was mediocre as well. We went with the frozen margarita only because we wanted a pitcher and the margarita on the rocks pitcher was much more expensive. The margarita was also unimpressive - perhaps the more expensive one would have been better but the regular on one the menu just tasted like frozen sour mix.   We had a good time, but if I were to ever go here again I would probably just go for chips, drinks and appetizers which I could get somewhere else anyway.",

Our waitress took a really long time to bring drinks...one person waited about 15 minutes for a Pepsi. Once we finally got around to placing our order about 7pm (waitress took that long to take our order), food didn't arrive until 1 hour later. The manager came to our table and half heartedly apologized for the delay..by this time half our party cancelled their food orders and left. Food was ok...nothing great and wasn't worth the long wait. Once we finished our meal , we sat with dirty plates in front of us for the remainder of our \"experience\". We waited so long to pay for the bill I actually had to get up and search for the manager to pay....3 hour experience I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Spoke with the manager and received the same lame apology.  The manager explained that they had a ton of reservations for big parties and weren't staffed appropriately.  Bad service even worse excuses and would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.",

Yea, they sell you an 18oz. drink, but whats the point if it sucks. Decided not to deal with the bartender directly instead of flustering our waiter again. Walked up to the bar and in a very calm, and nice way explained to the bartender that I was underwhelmed with my drink, that it was too sweet and I could not taste a hint of tequila. Well I guess tha was an insult, and instead of dealing with me as a customer, she told me that she made the drink and there was basically nothing wrong with it and nothing she could do. Really? This is the type of badly run, corporate restaurant I cannot stand. No owners to deal with, no one that cares, just crappy service and a culture that forgets about the customer. Owners need to go into a Houston's and see how a large corporate restaurant should be run.",

We were seated in a separate room in the back for our party but it seemed like a really fun place to hang out.  There was live music, plenty of different areas to sit in, and a lot of people enjoying themselves.  We had a buffet and I was very impressed with the menu options.  One of the dishes was green corn tamales, which I don't regularly see at Mexican restaurants (maybe they take too long to make?) and they were perfectly cooked.  Another surprise was a healthy green salad that really complimented our meal.  Sometimes when I eat Mexican food I don't feel like I am getting enough of a vegetable serving and this went perfectly.  The chips were also a big hit with everyone as they seemed to be fried and were a change from the traditional chip.  I was impressed by the flavorful and chunky salsa as well.",

The flakey flour chips are the best.  Second, order your custom margarita at the front outside bar. They will make them at that bar only for some reason. It comes on the rocks in a plastic tumbler with 1-2 glasses and will easily serve 2+ drinks. They make them with your choice of tequila and flavoring, I choose Don Julio Gold Anejo, Grand Marnier and they have a great lime mix they use. They have a menu with all the options, this was the best combo I tried. The price is more than standard drinks, but you will get your money's worth.  I have not eaten in the restaurant, but the take away is easy to order and has always been great. The patio is a great place for Happy Hour as well.",

We ate lunch out on the patio yesterday, and got one bowl of regular chips and one of flour chips. Then, as we read the new menus, we noticed that they are now charging $2.25 for any additional bowls of chips! And these are small bowls! My favorite part of going to ACs was the salsa and chips. Also, with a new menu you get, you guessed it, higher prices! And they eliminated our favorite lunch specials! The waitress said they are making their own chips now, instead of buying them, so, since they have to pay someone to make the chips, they can no longer just give them away in the same quantities. She said something about how so many chips were being left on the tables. I can understand raising prices. I can even understand charging for extra chips. But, I can't tolerate raising prices and charging for extra chips. At least put out a larger bowl of chips for the first batch!! This may seem petty to some, but to us it is a very big deal. We will patronize those restaurants that seem to value us as customers. Free chips are such a tradition, it's hard to have that taken away. Oh, and it was very nice out on the patio--loved (seriously) all the little birdies coming around for morsels.",
