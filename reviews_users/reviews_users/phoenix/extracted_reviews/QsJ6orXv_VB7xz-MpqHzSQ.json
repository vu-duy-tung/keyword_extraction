Great for breakfast, lunch and dessert.  My favorites meals are the California Love Wrap, Tacos Vivos, Elephant Curry Bowl, Arizona Roll & the Lumberjack Sandwich.  Honestly though, everything is amazing.  Their juices and smoothies are excellent too...my favorites are the Greena Colada and the Braveheart.  All of the desserts are amazing, but my favorite is the raw Snickers bar.  The coffee is excellent too!  Some people complain that it's expensive, but I think it is well worth the money for quality ingredients.",

I had the falafel salad and it was sooo good. The waiter asked me if I wanted a take home bag after I had eaten half of it, (It was a huge salad.) but I told him no, that I would eat it all. And that I did.  I consumed this huge salad and enjoyed every last bit.  The prices are pretty good, but I\"m cheap, so anything over $5 is a little high for me. (Which is absurd, I really need to work on that mindset!)  I also had some sort of juice.  I can't remember what I got I just remember it being like the drink of the gods.    As far as atmosphere, well, to be honest I thought I was back in the late '60's early 70's.  (Yep, I'm that old!!! But please don't tell anyone.)  Even though I'm an old hippie, it's hard for me to see young ones...now....in 2015.  Anyway, God bless 'em, right? The only thing I wish, I wish they were open at night and had alcoholic beverages.   I loved this place.  The food is marvelous....check it out!!!",

I do like the concept local veggies, meat free food and contemporary atmosphere. But $12 for a BLT and $11 for a Kale salad was a bit steep for a place where I order at the counter, refill my own water etc..    This is the crux of my issue the lack of value.   The BLT it self was decent, the Tempeh bacon was a bit sparse, the tomatoes were good as were the greens. The Side of hummus was bland and came with a few fresh veggies.  The Kale salad was good with a large flax seed chip, fresh kale and many other ingredients.  The pomfrits (french fries) were not as great mealy slices of potato under cooked in oil.  The Desert the almond joy $4 was quite decadent and tasty , however we decided to get this later on and had to wait in the slow line to order to get this.",

Most new vegan restaurants do this and it's a shame because that's all you taste-sweetness. The savory dishes I've had are amazing!

I've never been in, so i asked if I seat myself or wait to be seated. This question really threw the waiter for a loop. He just didn't know how to answer. Because I was carrying my laptop bag- he was more concerned on whether or not a was giving a lecture or something. Very strange... Then I had a seat, but no one came to my table to take my order. So, I notice the \"order here\" sign. I got up and asked, \"is this where I order?\". They responded, \"wherever....\".   It was like pulling teeth to figure out whether I seat myself or wait to be seated, whether a server takes my order or I order at the counter. It shouldn't be so hard to spend $20+ on a lunch and drink. Long story short- I just can't support a company with staff that are that confused and oblivious as to the basic functions of their job or just basic guest service.  I've never seen a place with such confused employees. I mean, who can't say whether its seat yourself or not? Who can't say whether a server will take your order or whether you order at the counter?   Ridiculous.",

Their Love the Whales Mac & Cheese bowl is probably the best vegan mac & cheese I've ever tried.  The portion size is huge and I split it up to last me three meals.  Their raw tostadas were absolutely incredible.  Every time I go there I look for this in the raw case, but alas, I've only been able to find it once.  Again, a very generous portion.  You can easily get leftovers from most of their meals.  The quesadilla was also good, and the tofu scramble is all right.  Tasty but nothing special.  Their coffees, however, have all been...well, bad.  I've tried a latte, a mocha, and the coconut caramel latte.  The coconut caramel latte was all right, although definitely not a favorite.  The latte and mocha were leaning toward the nasty side.  Their pancakes and French toast are a bit dry and not as fluffy as I would hope.  The cinnamon rolls, on the other hand, were great.  The chai muffin was all right, but cloyingly sweet.  In short, stick with any savory items you find on the menu, and if you're craving sweets or coffee, go to Nami instead.",

I love the Wild Western Tacos for breakfast. And for lunch either the avocado sandwich or elephant curry. (Not made from elephants.... C'mon!)  The smoothies and fresh juices are expensive but delicious. In fact that can be said of everything on the menu! However this is very much factored away when you consider their use of fresh, local, organic ingredients and very attentive service. My favorite juice is the cold and flu buster but often I just go for the fresh squeezed oj. This is the best place to get one of these I've found since moving to the valley 8 yrs ago.",

You can order things vegan or you can get eggs and/or dairy if you want. The presentation is beautiful. The raw desserts are to die for. If you're needing gluten-free, they can also make anything on the menu gluten-free. Sometimes (weekends) they have a biscuits and gravy special that is one of my favorite things.

If you plan on going here for lunch break between work you my not get you food in time before you need to go back to work. Plus everything is very pricy, 12-16 oz drink will run you 8 bucks! If you order a meal you will easily run you over 25 bucks.",

If you've ever been to San Francisco, then you'll definitely get that feel when you enter the cafe.  It's got a great atmosphere, and the menu is by far the best when it comes to serving healthy \"organic\" foods.  I know that many places in the valley claim to serve healthy food, but serving \"all-natural\" and locally farmed foods doesn't necessarily mean it's healthy.  People that are True foodie's know exactly what I mean.  I ordered the Dragon Bowl with quinoa and it was delicious.  I'm excited to try this place again.",

The restaurant itself is decorated super nice and the overall atmosphere is awesome. My wife and I decided to share a wrap that was stuffed with a bunch of fresh veggies and tofu. The overall flavor of the wrap was good, but I felt like it was lacking something. I did put on one of the hot sauces that they offer and that made it really flavorful. It came with a pretty generous portion of a side salad. While I do understand that serving organic produce can hike up the prices, the price for the wrap was a little steep at $15. However, it was actually a pretty good sized wrap despite the price point. We also ordered a specialty pancake that I was not a fan of at all. I also ordered a side of chips and salsa and I did like the flavor of the salsa but the chips texture were a little off. We really wanted to try a dessert but we were pretty full so we decided against it. I would love to come back, however I would need to order something different to wow me a little more.",

They took some of the old staff , particularly the manager, over to the new place I believe because I don't see her anymore. I say this because the place misses her.  Recently they took out the ability to order a small salad. Now it's just large. This particular salad I like (they changed the name 3 times in the past two years and took out then back in the kelp noodles) was only 9 dollars. Perfect for me for lunch. With a tip that's 11 dollars. Reasonable by any calculation. Now it's 16 dollars and sorry too much for me.   In terms of service. Very inconsistent and often dependent on the server. Some just look like they don't want to be there. And yes it's very slow at times. Order something to go and sit there? Be wary. At lunch you will wait a while. I waited 50 minutes. Went to the dollar store to shop and came back. And waited........  Food though is pure. Very good ingredients. The concept is what we need more of. This place just needs to work on delivery.",

Based on service I probably would have stopped coming.   There seems to be a lot of confusion with the staff. Incorrect to go orders, bringing me my cheesecake to go while I'm waiting outside and telling me that the rest of my food is going to be 15 minutes. Can you imagine what 15 minutes outside waiting in 100 degrees will do to my dessert?  Um it's going to melt.    Staff is trying, but not all of them seem like they have a clue. It comes off as too chill, too hippy dippy, not professional, and less than a 5 star worthy rating.  I want to see them take it up a notch and have the quality of service match the food.",

After finally being seated following a 30 minute wait for a table for 2 we placed our drink and food order immediately. I ordered one of the specialty coffee drinks and only after waiting 15 minutes for it...the waiter told me they were out of one of the ingredients for it. So after picking something else I finally had my TEN dollar drink...,20 minutes after being sat. It took 30 minutes for the food to come out which is so ridiculous as it was just a sandwich and a burrito. My sandwich was the tiniest I don't even thing they were full sized pieces of bread and the bread fell completely apart I had to eat it with a fork. The bill was $35 for a sandwich, a burrito and a coffee drink. Terrible service and way over priced. I just was not satisfied by any of it.",

So bless this place for keeping my friendship with my vegan friend together! They have such a creative and extensive menu of vegetarian and vegan options that keeps both meat eaters and non happy and full. The prices are a bit steep for lunch but you pay for what you get: truly organic and fresh ingredients made to order. Service is always stellar and excellent and I'll always be coming back!  ----------  This little cafe serves up some excellent vegan food for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians...but definitely at a price. I've come here on a few occasions, usually for brunch also some lunch here and there. Everything on the menu is vegetarian/vegan so you don't have to look twice if you're vegetarian. Everything I've had has been very flavorful enough to enjoy eating your guilty free, meatless dish. My favorites have been the supreme burrito which hides the vegetarian part of it very well, and the dragon bowl. I think the entrees here are moderately priced about $15 for larger portions, however their acai bowls and juices are incredibly pricey. $13 acai bowls and $10 juice is ridiculous but that's the price you pay for all organic ingredients. Overall they make healthy and vegan food very tolerable if you can also tolerate a little hipster vibe. Love taking my out of town vegetarian friends here for brunch.",

The final time was the last straw. This place failed on all accounts.   This review is for the last time I was there for breakfast, which was a few months back.   1) The prices are way too high. For some reason, restaurant owners seem to do this to make patrons feel like it is higher quality. Far from it in this case.   2) The food took forever!!!  It wasn't that crowded. But they had plenty of staff and it's not incredibly involved food to make. Most of it is not even cooked!  3) Even though we were there for ages, we were rarely checked on by our waitress.   4) By the time our food showed up, it was cold!  I'm not a huge fan of cold scrambled eggs.   5) This last part still blows my mind. My girlfriend ordered a blended drink with her meal. Several sips in she had a major reaction. She grabbed her mouth in pain. There was a sharp plastic shard in her drink that sliced into her gums. I asked for a manger who explained that it was probably from the container of one of the ingredients. She then proceeded to give us a gift card that had $25 written on it. She did not offer to cover our $70 breakfast!!!  The real kicker is that we went to redeem the card later on 2 frozen drinks only to find out that the gift card value was only $15 even though she had written $25 on the card. The drinks that we ordered were both so gross, that we threw them out.   Trust me, don't believe the hype.  Just because it's trendy, doesn't mean it's good.",

My favorite dish is the vegan nachos...I have gotten it a few times and it never disappoints! Do not come to this restaurant if you are in a rush or have less than an hour to spare, because you will be stressed by the wait. Last two times I've gone, it's been about 1.5 - 2 hrs between arrival time, finally being seated, and then waiting for our order to be taken and then waiting for our order to arrive and finally being able to eat our food.",

My husband and I were road-tripping from Utah back home to Austin and decided to drive through Phoenix. I googled \"vegan restaurants Phoenix\" and when I looked at the menu and saw that they had a raw vegan everything bagel I just about died. The staff were extremely friendly. We sat outside on the dog-friendly patio with our puppy, who they brought water right away and were very sweet to (that always gets extra points). I was bummed that they were out of the raw everything bagel but everything else was delicious. I got an abundance juice that hit the spot and the raw Arizona roll was light and flavorful- the tumeric dressing was creamy and amazing. My husband is a meat-eater and he got the Pom burger and was blown away- he said he would eat here all the time if we had one in Austin. I tasted his burger and coming from a long time vegan/vegetarian, it was one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had! We ended with gingerbread brownies. These were out of this world good! Sweet, fudgey, and just the right amount of gingerbread flavor without overpowering the chocolate. I really wish they would branch out to Austin. We will definitely be back next time we're in the Phoenix area.",

I browsed around and waited. After 20 minutes I inquired and was told my food was being put in a box. 5 minutes later I asked again and was told it would be a few more minutes. I left for 10 minutes, went to the store, and when I came back I asked again and was told to wait in line. I did so for 10 minutes and was told it was being put in a  box--how many boxes do I need?The hostess offered no condolence, just told me it would be a few minutes because they were busy.  It took 45 minutes to get a to go order from a half full restaurant.   On another occasion I brought my toddler and asked for a high chair. They say is at a high top--the high chair was a foot lower than the table. Their incompetence can be comical.",

Ordered the \"Bountiful Bowl\" which consisted of black beans and rice, carrots, avocado, and peppers.  I am an athlete and consume a lot of food, but even considering that, I think the portion size was rather small.  Disappointing.  Left the place still hungry.  My wife had the soup of the day and the Caesar salad which were better than my bowl, but again, the portion sizes left something to be desired.  I might go back and give this one another chance, but I'm in no hurry to do so.",

The \"donut holes\" (don't be deceived by the name) are delicious and I loved their new \"Island Drink\" (green and fruit). I've had a TON of food from this place and always enjoyed it.  Now, a note too the not to great reviews that i read. Everyone, of course, is intitled to his/her opinion. The prices are a little upwards of what you expect for a cafe, but the woman at the counter said that EVERYTHING is organic/local when they can. Which accounts for the cost, I believe. I like to support local goods/family owned.  This is not fast food. Go here planning to spend a leisurely lunch/brunch. I also like to go during the off times, around 10am is usually good or for a snack at 3pm.   So it's True that you have to work around a couple of things, but I love this place anyway. Who doesn't want to eat food with heart?",

    "text": "I am so excited for this place! I was just talking with Brady K. about how the Valley needs more breakfast/lunch cafes with character, and for sure Pomegranate Cafe delivers.  They have an extensive juice and smoothie menu, a plethora of unique teas, and ubber yummy breakfast, lunch and confection options.  Best of all, they use local, organic produce from the farms at South Mountain, and make all items on premises...including their almond milk!  Seriously, I love it!    Make sure to say hi to Matt when you go in.  He manages the joint, as well as bakes and makes the almond milk.  Best of all, he is great with names and conversation, so you will feel like you are old friends and you have been going there for years even though it just opened about 6 weeks ago.    For this visit, I had the white peony tea, which has a very delicate flavor and an essence of apples.  Brady K. ordered the Wild Western Tacos, and oh, my, God!  they looked awesome.  Huge portion.  Two stuffed to capacity spinach tortillas with scrambled eggs (or tofu is an option), zucchini, avocado, heirloom tomatoes, sharp cheddar.  Pomegranate Cafe offers good home cooking taken to the next level.  Imagine you had a professional kitchen with all the goodies and could just get nuts with ingredients and creativity.  It's kinda like that.  The kind of food people make because they would actually eat it, not because it's a job.  I can't say enough about this place.    Also, all drinks ordered to stay come with a yummy little cookie.  It's the little things that make a place great!  Today's cookie was an almond cookie made with maple syrup and the almond pulp left over from the latest batch of almond milk.  When I asked Matt if he had culinary training, he just said, \"I like to do stuff.\"  Simple answer, and the awesomeness of his enthusiasm to create is apparent in everything we experienced about this place.  I can't wait to go back!",

A locally owned restaurant in the middle of a strip mall that looks pro enough that it could be a franchise. But its comfy and calming. Everyone was friendly and helpful and it was nice to see the owner working behind the counter with her troops.   The food: This vegan had the breakfast burritos AND the Philly sandwich. Affordable -- about $10 per dish. Great drinks with juiced veggies and fruits. I had the cucumber celery apple drink called the Refresher. I had the tofu and vegan cheese in my burro which was great. The bread on my Philly was the right texture and everything flavorfully complimented each other. The dishes are creative and unique -- so much more than salads.   She had the french toast with berry compote and real maple syrup and it was all gone pretty quick. Her Adventure drink was very yummy as well.   The vegan chocolate chip cookies were a great way to wrap up the brunch.   I am definitely coming back here again and again. They've only been open since the beginning of the year. They want to expand to organic wines and dinner times. I'm looking forward to that.",

When this place first opened, my husband and I were stoked as our whole family is vegan. Unfortunately, back then the portions were tiny (my husband was still hungry when we left), the service slow, and the flavor was not memorable.  Today, after several YEARS (yes, years) we tried it again. Oh. My. Gawd. We ordered two of the raw dishes: the raw tacos and the Arizona roll. The tacos were INCREDIBLE. Spicy, great texture, and filling. The Arizona roll was just as filling and flavorable. I've been on a raw kick for almost a month, and I haven't felt as satisfied with a raw meal as I did today.  We spolied ourselves by getting the raw \"snickers\" bar and lemon bar. The snickers bar was absolutely heavenly. It was definitely enough for two people to share. The lemon bar was not as great, but had I not already tasted the snickers I probably would have thought it was bliss.  Needless to say, we feel guilty about not having given Pomegranate a second chance earlier. We were missing out. I can't wait to go back for \"Raw Fridays\" and Sunday brunch!",

    "text": "I had a great time at pomegranate cafe yesterday. The prices are high but it is worth it for what you are getting. Everything is vegan unless you specify you want dairy cheese or eggs on something. Yesterday I found out they even have cocktails! Two of us got the screwdriver with tangerine sorbet and it was so tasty! It was honestly the perfect summer treat. Another friend got the lavender sour and that was great too! As far as food goes, we all split the vegan spinach artichoke dip. I was skeptical because I like my spinach artichoke dip and I LOVE cheese. it was SO creamy and delicious! It tasted like the real thing and I was honestly blown away. It came with corn chips and this AMAZING bread that I haven't had there before. It was literally so. good. I have tried their Arizona roll a million times and it is a delicious alternative to sushi. I used to get the cauliflower buffalo quesadilla and I was sad to see they took it off the menu, our wonderful server said they could make me one anyway! Overall we had a great time with delicious food. The price is the only thing I wish I could change. I understand because it is all organic, local and vegan though. With 2 drinks each, one meal and splitting the appetizer 3 ways it was about $44 each. Regardless I will be back soon!",

My son loved his quesadilla with the side of rice and beans and his cookie. Good teas and hot chocolate too.",

Happy Hour includes food and drinks.   Happy Hour Portions: Raw Tacos Vivos and Falafel Slider Both items are one serving each, and a great way to taste their menu. The Tacos Vivos has every taco topping you could possibly think of, it was fantastic. And they don't skimp on the guacamole! The falafel slider is served on their house bread, and it was a little dry for me, but the actual falafel was tasty.    Entree: Curried Sweet Potato Quesadilla This was a seasonal item, and it was far better than I was expecting. The sweet potatoes with the tamarind salsa was a flavorful combination that brought the dish together. They have house hot sauces if you need an extra kick.    This place is very popular for juices and coffees. I didn't get any but I would return for a fresh smoothie. They have a very extensive brunch menu and I would love to come back to try this. Overall, I would recommend this to a friend.   PS: If you sign up to receive text message alerts, you can get a free cowgirl cookie (it was delicious) or an iced tea.",

Oddly out of place in the urban jungle that is the Phoenix metro area, but definitely welcome.   Some of the menu is raw, but I'm often up for trying new things, so I ordered the bagel sandwich (no onion). This is without a doubt, one of the best vegan dishes I've had in a restaurant, the bagel was more like a flat bread, and the filling was just the right about vegetables, including sprouts and vegan cream cheese. Fantastic.   I'd also ordered a too large bottle of organic ale (excellent too) , and gave the rest to the neighboring table. Finally, I risked the dessert. It was OK, but it didn't matter, the rest was amazing.   Sadly my short time in Chandler meant that I wasn't able to go again. I'm sure I'll visit again one day. I just hope it's not 114 out.",

The second time i had their pom burger and I believe there was a complication due to my pickiness but they got it taken care of right away and were super friendly. The third time and at the time of this review i got the BBQ jackfruit quesadilla but unfortunately they ran out of the jackfruit but instead of jackfruit they let me sub it out for the vegan \"chicken\" they offer and it was amazing.",

The decor is kind of country incorporating wood furniture with contemporary light fixtures with vibrant and colorful paintings of plants and flowers.  We had a sweet server.  She was an absolute doll.  I usually ask for help when I have a hard time choosing and the options on the menu were things like biscuit and gravy, quiche lorraine, but the Pomegranate had it's own twist that made each dish, even if traditional american fare, exciting.  The coffee and espresso sounded so tasty but I'd already had my fill.  My compadre enjoyed the Coconut caramel latte.  Mmmmm-of course I had a sip.  I ordered the quiche lorraine  that was topped with the Jalapeno creme and was accompanied with a side salad.  Yum! It had  thick crust and I can't tell you all the ingredients but it was flavorful and a little spicy.  I enjoyed it.  The salad was a great side kick.  It was greens and shredded carrots tossed in what tasted like coconut aminos and citrus!  Yum!  My taste buds were happy!  my friend had a breakfast wrap which was ginormous!  Think cut in two and chipotle sized.  I had a great time here!  The wait time on a Saturday was fast, the atmosphere was casual and the food was awesome!  When I'm headed their direction again, I'll be by!  It was the perfect brunch spot on my road-trip from Tucson to the San Bernardino, CA area!",

Everything in this cute little cafe is organic or local bought. I ordered the breakfast burrito and added egg to it. It was filled with egg, black beans, kale, and sweet potato. They gave me a side of tortilla chips and salsa on the side with it. The burrito was just okay. It was wrapped very loosely - Everything was falling out. The beans were undercooked and hard. If I didn't add the egg, I don't think it would have really tasted like a burrito at all. The fresh apple slices on the side of my plate were soggy, old and seemed like it was soaked in lemon water for days. My friend ordered one of their sandwiches. It looked much more appetizing.   Our server was friendly and happy, just slow.   Environment: 5/5 Food: 2/5 Price: 3/5 Service: 4/5",

Ok, so restaurant is not strictly vegan, the menu is standardly vegan and you can get egg or cheese added on at additional cost, which I have to admit I LOVE that, after years of going to other restaurants that will \"be happy to\" make your dish vegan by taking off cheese and egg and charging you the same price.   Anyhow, I went off on a tangent and I only order the vegan options anyway.    The items on the menu are fresh, super duper tasty, and great portions.  Fabulous breakfast choices!!!!! YAY!  VEGANS REJOICE!  It is so hard to find decent vegan breakfast options around Phoenix, and Pomegranate Cafe has amazing breakfast options!!!  I cannot wait until the new central Phoenix location is opened!    Thank you Pomegranate Cafe for being SO AWESOME!",

Since it my birthday I had dinner plans coming up so I knew that I couldn't get anything big to eat, and I immediately regretted that!  Everything just looked delish and I wanted to try it all!  After checking out the dessert display, I picked out a Brazilian Brownie, I won't lie, I wasn't sure what to expect from this raw brownie, but I was not disappointed.  It wasn't the same texture as a normal brownie, but it wasn't bad either. The brownie tasted great, it was sweet, but not too sweet, the texture was similar to how coconut would be. I was not disappointed in it at all   Looking forward to my next trip back!",

Being vegan I want to always support vegan restaurants but the experience I had tonight has literally put an awful taste in my mouth.  A close friend of mine recently became sick after eating one of their burritos and I honestly didn't believe her. That is until tonight when I took my family here to have dinner. My father had to use the restroom at the restaurant to vomit and the rest of us felt sick to our stomachs. I threw up as soon as I got home.   Why didn't we tell the server? Well we had a conflict with not our main waitress, but the waitress who brought out our food. My father's order was not placed correctly due to miscommunication and the waitress had the worst attitude offset by her snide comments. After that ordeal we didn't need the headache.  The food is also very expensive. Save your money.   Overall? As rude as it sounds if I wanted to feel ill after eating, have terrible service, and waste my money I'd just go to the McDonalds in the same parking lot.",

My friend had mentioned it to me and said I would love it and with her love for food maybe being as much as mine I trusted her and she has yet to disappoint.   I called in for pick up and the woman on the phone was so nice and delightful. She said that the wait was only going to be about 10 to 15 minutes which I was very surprised about being a Sunday morning and a holiday weekend. So I ordered the wild western tacos and an abundance juice. the total came out to be $27 which at the time I thought was rather high. When I went to pick up my food the guy at the counter was very friendly and I just instantly fell in love with the atmosphere and environment of the place.   I tried my juice in the car on the way home and honestly it was just okay. For $9 I was expecting a little bit more. The tacos however were AMAZING and such a huge portion which I love so I can save for later.   Five stars. You guys rock.",

Very healthy and yummy. I had some room for desert and coffee (coconut milk/oil fans celebrate!!) and it was just to die for! Their brownie cake is the ultimate cheat day delight",

Even the chicken wings were on point- like real but not quite.  Their food deserves an ovation, totally fleck.  Overall it's reps well and I'd go back again...especially at happy hour.  Yo dang ...yo check this out yo, I almost forgot try out their desserts, so yummy.  (See what I mean about the estrogen thing, it's contagious)",

I wasn't a huge fan of the house bun through, I thought it was too dense and more like a heavy biscuit than a bun. The potato salad was really good, I'm not a huge fan of a lot of places potato salad because they tend to over do it with the dill, but they had the perfect amount in theirs.   The local hummus plate was good, could have used more carrots and other veggies. Bit of an olive overload.   Cowgirl cookie- I'm a cookie monster and I wish I had gotten more than one, it was just that good. Their treat case was full of so many tasty looking goodies.   I hope to come back and try their other items in the near future",

    "text": "I came here this past Easter with my family, we had a decent size group (6) so I made reservations before hand. I was excited to try this location (which is well over an hour away from me) in particular because I wanted to try the different menu options. I had even called ahead to ensure that they would be serving their regular menu items along with the Easter brunch menu and whoever I was speaking with that day had told me that they would be. Needless to say that when we got there and got our menus it was a let down to discover that they in fact were not serving food from their regular menu....We all ordered and when the food came most of the groups dishes were cold and the veggies were still mostly raw in the napoleon grilled cheese and harvest hash! It seemed like the plates had been ready to bring to us for a while so they had just been sitting out and getting cold before they were actually brought over. There were a few mix ups with drink orders on top of that as well. The front manager there (Daniella) had to come over and offered to have our cold meals redone. We eventually got our hot meals but mine was brought out with a completely empty cup where the bbq sauce was supposed to be! How do you bring over a plate and not notice that lol? I just had to laugh at that one though. The food was great once everything was done correctly and Daniella really saved the day. Our meal ended up being on the house which was really amazing of her to do! We got a few desserts, the carrot cake and carrot cupcake. The cake tasted great but had way too much frosting and the cupcake was totally try.",

I had the Dragon Bowl with quinoa and it far exceeded my expectations. The \"chicken\" in the bowl was Beyond Meat, which I love and the veggies were roasted to perfection. The real heros in this dish are the toasted pecans and the Thai sauce - both are huge flavors but neither overtaking the dish. It's just really nicely balanced and of course super healthy. My husband had the everything bagel and it was just way too much food to eat. The bagel itself was more like a bagel chip but dense, so when you bit into it, it didn't break it just squooshed everything out of the sandwich. It was good just really messy and hard to eat. The salad that came with it was a meal all by itself. So overall the food was pretty darn delicious. The server that waited on us was really nice and super knowledgable but not very attentive given that they weren't busy. We'll go back and eat here anytime we're in town.",

My only complaint was being forced to pick just one dish! Everything looked and tasted wonderful. I had a beet burger (a first for me and I LOVE beets). Most beets can be VERY earthy but this was a beautiful and delicious mix of herbs and spices. They served it with a great aioli sauce, a kale salad and sweet potato fries. My friend had the walnut meat salad which was HUGE but she said it tasted great. We had the Hibiscus Cooler and Green Apple Lime Refresh. It was a bit pricy but no more so than a good sushi lunch. The portions were very generous. The atmosphere was great, lots of couples, families, young and old, and all very down to earth. They also had an extensive GF, GFO, and RAW (basically uncooked)  selection. At some point I'm going back for the RAW! Arizona Roll (vegan sushi) and Abundance juice soon.",

I tried a few bites of the Ranchero skillet  and that was awesome, despite the super hard tortilla it came with. I enjoyed the earthy ambiance and love eating organic. I am curious to try this place out again. However, I am not sure how often I could realistically eat there based on the prices. Over $30 for 2 breakfast entrees, a lemonade, and an iced americano is a bit pricey.  Overall, my first time at Pomegranate Cafe was a delicious experience.",

Often standing there for five minutes just wishing someone would make eye contact, smile, and say hello. It's not very big or ever super busy so out of the 3-4 people working you would think one of them could look up and say hello.  Coffee is great though.  :)",

They are just coming out of their newbie stage so give them a chance as they are getting busy and also still learning like a new place should. But truly this place is a winner, great food, and wonderful herbal teas and smoothies. They also have raw food amazing cakes, and gluten free choices.  Give it a try....it is not fast food so be patient and enjoy! Hope they keep the same familiar faces as regulars  like to see familar employees. Susan~ Awatukee Resident",

We recently moved to the area and are not into the chain restaurants or fast food joints. Pomegranate Cafe fit the bill perfectly. Breakfast was healthful and delicious with lots of flavorful ingredients like avocado, kale, pesto and nuts. We had the Green Garden Protein Bowl and the Breakfast Burrito- they were both a huge hit. Cassie, one of the owners, was delightful and helpful as we were making our selections. The restaurant itself is colorful and cheerful. We will definitely keep the Pomegranate on our 'must eat there often list.'",

    "text": "I was so excited to try a new place with vegan food, but my experience was completely ruined by the horrendous service. The food we ordered was decent- we tried the nachos (which were okay, but kind of soggy and used a lot of fake vegan cheese) and a veggie bowl (which was much better but not something you can't find at most vegetarian places). The service during our meal was not particularly fast, but average. However, after our meal, we paid and ordered dessert from their counter up front. We expected that we would pay for it and they would hand it to us from inside the glass case. No- instead we waited over an hour for it. I spoke with someone behind the counter after half an hour, thinking they lost the order (why they needed an order to hand us something from behind the counter is beyond me), but the person said we need to wait and would be called when our order was ready. After about 45 minutes, I thought maybe they weren't going to hand us dessert from the display but were instead making it from scratch. Again, no! I was getting ready to walk out of the restaurant and never return when they called us to the counter and handed us our order (a slice of cake) from behind the counter in a box. Why I had to wait over an hour for that is beyond me and I was incredibly angry. Additionally, I was checking my credit card statement after our visit and we were charged an extra seven dollars (presumably for a tip) after we left a generous, undeserved twenty percent tip at our table. We will never return to this establishment and would definitely not recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "This cafe is 100% vegetarian, with the vegan option available on every menu item.  From past experiences with veggie restaurants in Phoenix, this kind of classification would probably make me less eager to try the place......  which is why I'm happy that the chef/owner instead chose to focus on the fact that they use fresh, local, and organic ingredients -- vegetarianism is more of an afterthought.  So we decided to try it yesterday for lunch.  To start, Pomegranate offers a wonderful selection of teas, coffees, and various juice/smoothie options.  I wanted something cool and caffeinated, so I ordered the toddy, which features my favorite local roaster's beans -- Cartel.  My wife order a peach iced tea.  Very good, but if memory serves correctly, you won't find any drink options for less than $2.00 or so.  Then onto the main course.  I ordered the veggie burger, which is made from a sprouted tofu, served on a sprouted spelt bun, and garnished with cheddar cheese (or vegan cheese if you prefer), avocado, tomato, and a little tiny dollop of miso mayonnaise.  It also comes with a catch-all selection of sides: salad, tortilla chips, fruit slices, and a pickle.  $10 or so.....  Here's my take on the burger:  The spelt bun was better than any other spelt bun/bread that I've ever had before.  This was perhaps the second most notable part of this burger.  The most notable was the patty itself, which had a nice mellow nutty flavor -- not trying too hard to be be fake beef and not overpowering in soy flavor.  It was actually one of my favorite veggie burgers ever.  But here's my beef with the preparation: too skimpy on the rich, fatty stuff.  There was a very thin slice of cheese and almost nothing of the single condiment provided, which the menu told me was a miso mayo.  Thanks to the avocado, it was still a little rich, but not the kind of juicy decadence that I've always felt characterizes a great burger.  And seriously, I would have liked to have tasted the miso mayonnaise, but instead added my salad dressing to the burger to make it less dry, and this basically obscured whatever taste the mayo may have offered.  The salad was just fine, garnished with what seemed like a raw berry dressing of some sort.  I had no idea that the white stuff in the plastic cup was also for the salad (apparently a living caesar dressing), until the meal was almost over.  I thought it was my mayonnaise for the burger.  Next time, I'll try to get it right and see how the salad tastes with both dressings.  We also tried the hummus, mainly because it's the perfect baby-appropriate snack for my son to sling all over the restaurant (the remarkably polite staff was also quite pleasant about bringing in a messy toddler, by the way, which is a plus).  The hummus was actually quite tasty, but somehow not in a \"traditional\" way.  It seemed a little crisper and fresher than most hummus I've had, which was a nice complement to the fresh veggies served with it.  My only additional request for the hummus is that perhaps the restaurant could throw in a few tortilla chips as well?  My wife tried the vegan BLT, made with a tempeh-based bacon.  It must have been tasty, because this is one of the first times I've missed my opportunity to try a bite of her dish.  She literally devoured it and then criticized me for nitpicking at the veggie burger's preparation.  I'm pretty sure she'd give this place a 5-star rating, and she may convince me to do the same on our return visit with the in-laws, who have been looking for a place like this.  Oh, one final note.  I spoke with the chef/owner after our meal, to offer our compliments and inquire about the cuisine and the marketplace, etc.  She mentioned something that should be readily apparent to most foodies, which is that the key to providing tasty veggie options is to go with a macrobiotic whole food focus -- this approach de-emphasizes the constraints and instead focuses on building a good meal from quality ingredients.  Well done, chef.",

I was one of 3 other people in the restaurant, and I was asked two times after paying what I had ordered. They offered me a \"couple of desserts for the wait.\" Instead I received a single bite sized cookie. The food isn't terrible when they actually make what you ask ( I have asked for no olives on my salads 3 times, and always end up with olives) but it certainly isn't worth the price, or the time it takes. I have wasted several lunch breaks at Pomegranate. I've given this place way too many chances.",

Phoenix, so it's always been a hike. But it's been a hike worth taking! The food is amazing and ever changing. We usually like to check out whatever is on the daily specials board. The desserts are equisite! We even had them make our wedding cake (berry lemon ginger vegan cheesecake). My favorite drink is Cassie's latte, either hot or cold. The lumberjack sandwich, the almond joy, the quesadillas...all amazing and vegan! (or with eggs and cheese for other tastes). Everyone is friendly and helpful.

The omelet was also fresh but not quite enough cheese. The veggies were squash, carrots (orange, yellow, purple). All in all, I would give this place another shot.

I opted for eggs, vegan cheese and requested a side of the salsa, as I do like eggs spiced up a bit it.   The whole grain toast perfect, not too seedy or bland.   The hash; a combination of roasted butternut squash, yukon potatoes and sweet potatoes forced me to devour every morsel.   The fresh squeezed orange juice reminded me to pull out my juicer, so worth the effort.   Marlene offered me a seasonal spice cookie.   Yeah, ate that as soon as I got home, Fall has arrived.    This family owned gem is in my neighborhood, I so want it to endure all the strip mall changes locally.  I will bring friends and family, one can pig-out and feel good about it.

    "text": "I saw that Pomegranate Cafe was one of the best new restaurants in Phx, so i went to Yelp to read more about it. I had lunch there this week- had the Super Green Kale Salad and thought it was fantastic! The flavors were so complex and yummy, i swooned over every bite! I left there feeling healthier!  People have commented that they felt it was pricey but worth it! I felt i totally got my mone's worth, and didn't even think about price.  Marlene and her daughter go to such extremes to discover new ways to make their recipes taste so delicious, and being all organic and  so incredibly fresh, i would've paid more than I did for the experience!  The cafe has such a friendly, neighborhood feeling, and the perfect place to go after shopping for groceries at Trader Joe's!  I highly recommend you give Pomegranate a try! You will keep it on your list of delicious, healthy eats!",

The place is busy, so their food is always fresh due to the quick turn-over of food. The  food is high-quality, so I would say the prices are fair. Anyone who shops at Whole Foods can appreciate the cost that went into this food.",

    "text": "I've been in there often due to convenient location, but, I usually do not feel good physically after eating there.  I've ordered things with cheese, but, I'm very concerned that possibly I may have been getting dairy cheese instead of vegan cheese.  They say they are vegan AND vegetarian.  But, I realize if they are offering dairy cheese & eggs on their menu, I feel extremely uncomfortable with that.    As much as they write they are organic, using local companies, etc., the part that would make them appear ethical....the very fact that they offer dairy & egg products, makes them no different than any ordinary restaurant.  Dairy products are the cruelest industry out there - even more than ordinary meat, &, it's already been proven that even a small amount of dairy causes cancer.  I need to start going back to strictly vegan restaurants, even if they are farther from where I live.  I wish Pomegranate Cafe would just let go of the non-vegan foods.  If they are supposedly so knowledgeable about health, organic, etc., they need to catch up to the several vegan restaurants who are making spectacular tasting foods.",

It was yummy but you have to be in the mood to splurge.  Kids did not like the french toast which is much more like banana bread served with syrup.  They also weren't thrilled with the mac and cheese which is white and quite bland.  I absolutely loved my tacos with tofu and guacamole and roasted vegetables.  I will for sure order it again.  We had 2 adults and 3 kids for breakfast.  The total with tip was over $100.  Ambiance is fun and service was wonderful and friendly.",

Super friendsly (and not overly cheesy) staff, BOMB food, fresh juice, smoothies, espresso and yes, even alcohol.   Raw food options that will blow your mind. The flavor profiles in their dishes are phenomenal. Whoever this chef is knows what's up!  Even if you're not into the whole vegetarian/raw/vegan lifestyle, you will be surprised at how good this place is.   I am currently pregnant and unable to have caffeine and I really miss and crave coffee. The always friendly staff is eager to recommend something new and on my last visit I was turned on to Jnantik. This is a Mayan superfood coffee substitute that actually tastes/smells similar to coffee! They mix it right in with their Pom milk (a blend of various nut and soy milks) and serve it as a latte. So not only did this satisfy my coffee craving, but it is packed with vitamins and minerals to give me a natural energy boost!",

Our server was happy and attentive with water/orders et cetera.   The maca mocha was DELICIOUS and small for the price ($10!?)... but man, so good. I wish I had another one!  Weird it's in a strip mall, but once you're inside you forget that... especially because of the prices. Am I in Malibu? We spent $95 for brunch for 3 people (one app, 3 meals, 2 coffees)... I expect those prices in LA or NY, so that was a bit disappointing to find them in a strip mall off the freeway.   Portions are generous though. I took my leftovers home and discovered some SYSCO plastic cooked in with my tofu! Glad I saw it before I could take a bite, but does make me wonder what is going on in the back....   Either way, I'd come back! I'd comb through my food a little more carefully and savor my maca mocha a little more slowly.",

I asked the server to recommend a smoothie and he suggested the Greena Colada - great selection; it was delicious although rather pricey at $10 for a glass. Yikes.  For eats, I ordered the Big Kahuna burger (sweet potato and black bean) in a collard wrap with root veggie fries and pom bbq sauce. Again, I thought it was a little pricey at $14 but I have to admit that it was tasty and filling.  It might not be a place that you could afford to eat at regularly, but it definitely is worth a trip once in a while. Tasty food, incredible selection, vast drinks menu (including a few organic beers), and we had a super friendly and helpful server. Oh, and their restroom is cute!",

The cafe is really cute, near a trader joes which I think is a fitting location haha. Went at like 3pm on a Saturday and there was a pretty good crowd, I'm sure they get busy in there! I liked the decor and how the water was served in mason jars, pretty cute. It was so hard to decide what to order. Everything looked so amazing, totally my type of food! I ended up getting a burrito. I can't remember the name of it but it had a ton of veggies and was covered in red sauce. They used cashew cheese too which I love! The food was amazing and fresh and I nearly ate the whole burrito! Only downside: it was $15 for one burrito. I know it's all good quality ingredients and such but that seemed a little outrageous for me. Food was so good though Id come back. Id like to try something else on the menu too! Definitely a must-try for vegans and vegetarians, yummy!",

For example, organic maple syrup was the only option. Coconut whipped cream was the only option.  Much of the food tasted like cardboard. I had cranberry pancakes that were free and egg free, vegan, and they were not good.  For someone that has severe allergies and likes alternative ingredients, this would be a good place to go.

I would definitely drive here again, it's so worth it to me!!",

    "text": "I've been to Pom multiple times and I am always happy with the food.  Although expensive, it's fresh and yummy.  The service is hit or miss... unfortunately today was a huge miss and I'm not sure we will be back.   We arrived on bike with our two hungry kiddos (3.5 and 8 months). We were greeted and sat right away and ordered two drinks (a cold tea and a hot tea). Our drinks arrived about 10 minutes after we ordered them and were delivered by someone other than our server. 10 minutes after we got our drinks I asked one of the other staff members to please let our server know that we would like to order. About 3-5 minutes after that she came to take our order.  At this point we had been there for almost a half hour already.  She put our order in and we watched 3 parties that had arrived after us receive their food.  15 minutes later our 3.5 year olds food arrived. About 5-8 minutes after that my husband and I got our food minus the avocado toast...our server said the toast would be right out (it never came).  The food was good- no complaints there but the service was horrible. The server did remove the avocado toast (obviously) but didn't even bat an eye about how slow our service was or the fact that we were there for an hour and a half for lunch with two young kids.  I was visibly peeved but decided not to say anything while we were there as to not interrupt anyone else service- they were clearly not staffed appropriately for a Saturday morning/afternoon. I am all about relaxing and have a lot of patience when it comes to restaurants because I worked in one for 7 years through college. What I see time and time again at Pom is disorganization. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the order of the service.  We ordered 2 dishes and a chimpanzee bowl for our toddler (which is literally cereal and a side of milk) and saw THREE other parties get there food before us who arrived well after us. They were hot dishes too, not just salads or cold wraps that would take less time. Ahwatukee is growing with more and more options for great food.  It's too bad that we had this experience today.",

    "text": "Order an elephant bowl, save an animal's life! I love that this cafe donates a portion of their earnings on certain items towards worthy causes. I ordered the elephant bowl partially because of this (Wildlife SOS receives $1 from each bowl sold). I also had an iced lavender latte.   The elephant bowl comes with your choice of protein and carb. I chose the walnut meat and kelp noodles. I got the order to go and took a seat to wait for my meal.   The lavender latte was made first and was light and refreshing. It had a hint of the lavender flavor but the main component I could taste was the creamy coconut milk. They use Peixoto coffee which is great since they are an excellent local company that roasts fabulous coffee beans.  The main meal took quite a bit of time to make. I think I was waiting nearly 30 minutes but all the staff members were very apologetic about it. My bowl came in a compressed paper container in a brown paper bag. I placed the bag securely on the passenger side floor mat and I was on my way home.  While driving on the way home the curry in the bowl was so watery that it spilled out of the container (Which was on the shallow side and did not have a sauce-proof seal) all over the bag, which caused the bag to leak all over my floor mat. A day later I am still trying to air out my car because curry+ hot car is not a good fragrance in a small enclosed space in the AZ heat!  The actual bowl though was a hefty portion with lots of vegetables, walnut meat, and noodles. The curry sauce that didn't spill out onto my car was full bodied and complimented the rest of the ingredients well. The kelp noodles were intriguing as this was my first time having them. They were clear, had a springy, chewy texture and neutral flavor.   The price was a little high, with my total being a little over $20 with tax. They do use high quality ingredients, use eco friendly packaging, and have generously sized portions to make up for the cost though.  While I enjoyed the bowl and latte, I would definitely not get any orders from here to go again. So, if I'm in the mood to dine in I'll try Pomegranate Cafe again.",

The food is very hearty and filling and they have large portions. We got the burrito Bandito, and the grilled cheese sandwich, along with a coffee and iced tea. For dessert we got the chocolate cake which was vegan super dense and delicious. Sitting outdoors on the patio was very enjoyable, there are pigeons around that seem like they are regulars here as well and are fun to watch. They have fresh desserts made from scratch. We had to take ours to go because we got full off of just the burrito and even then had leftovers. The service was excellent, I highly recommend the pomegranate cafe to anyone.",

I can't get enough of their food! I've tried almost everything on their menu without disappointment. I haven't tried all of their desserts, but the ones I have tried are phenomenal.  One thing to note, if you've never been or only been a few times ... it WILL take a while for your food to come out - and that has nothing to do with their abilities. It's because they make their food fresh and more-often-than-not from scratch! So be kind and patient, because it'll be well worth it!",

    "text": "My boyfriend surprised me with a trip to Arizona for my birthday and the first place he brought me to was the Pomegranate Cafe!  First: My first initial reaction when I saw the Pomegranate Cafe was, \"Omg how cute\". The outdoor seating had succulents and mini cactus everywhere! My boyfriend and I walked into the cafe and we were immediately seated. As I look around the cafe, it felt very open and airy. We arrived in Phoenix around 9:30 am on a Friday, which explains why it wasn't so busy.  Second: We order the full size \"Gila Monster Nachos\" and the \"Chimi `Chicken` Burrito. It didn't take any longer than 15 mins to get our food. The portion size for the nachos was huge! It was more than enough for both of us! We didn't even finish it! I'm getting hungry even thinking about the nachos right now. It was soooo good! We both loved everything about it! The cashew nacho cheese, the walnut taco meat, the chimichurri and baja sauce etc. My God, it was so yummy! Then the burrito came in, my boyfriend and I split the burrito because we didn't want to be overly full. The burrito had a lot of guacamole and it was warm (first initial reaction), I gave it a few more bites and I fell in love with it. THE  \"CHICKEN\" WAS COOK TO PERFECTION! Wtf, it's been 7 years since I had meat and that chicken was probably the closest thing to it! It was juicy and chewy and it tasted like they had seared the chicken! The combination of the beans plus the brown rice was a lot so I do recommend getting one of the other. My boyfriend said he probably would prefer it to be more of a dry burrito, but I didn't mind the gauc, I'll probably order it on the lighter side next time.  Finally: The end result, we loved it. We loved the food, the ambiance, our waitress was really nice. WE LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT POMEGRANATE CAFE!!!!!!!!!  Suggestions: COME TO CALIFORNIA and lighter Gauc for the burrtio!",

    "text": "I was pretty sceptical about this place from the other reviews that I had read on Yelp. It turned out to be a great place to eat. The only thing I would tell this restaurant to change is to get a bigger location because the place was packed when I went in for lunch.   As far as some of the issues that were mentioned in previous reviews, it looked like pomagrante cafe worked to fix them. No more paper plates and the restaurant was kept pretty clean, especially with how busy they were. While I was there another customer had dropped something and anywhere else it would have stayed there until they slowed down, not here though one of the employees who was delivering food to tables cleaned it up and was busing tables inbetween dropping off food. I was impressed.  There are some things in other reviews that are still True. Food does take a while there, which I think was mainly because of how busy they were. Plus portion sizes were a little on the small side, I felt that they were plety big enough to calm my appitiete, which was what I was going for.   As far as vegitarian/vegan places go, this one rocks. Check it out.",

It's so difficult to even choose what to order because everything is amazing. The bowls and wraps are fantastic. The Elephant Bowl, California Love Wrap, and the Macro Greens Bowl are all wonderful. The tacos are killer. The desserts are sublime. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. On my most recent trip to Phoenix and Sedona I ate at many restaurants -trying to find great food and willing to pay up for it - and the meal I had at Pomegranate stood head and shoulders above anything else.",

We went in here for breakfast not long ago and the joint had a nice atmosphere and the staff was super friendly.  Here's the thing, though. While I was satisfied with just a fresh (moderately priced) vegetable juice, my girlfriend wanted to try their avocado sandwich. This thing runs you $7.50 and is tiny! More a bite than an actual breakfast, this item was definitely not worth it. Perhaps their other menu items have larger portions, and I would be more than willing to try Pomegranate Cafe again. But for my money, I'd much rather go down the road to 24 Carrots for breakfast.",

The inside is large and spacious, casual. Service is not great, but this place also gets pretty busy around lunchtime. If you don't like vegan or vegetarian, this is not the place for you! There are no chicken sandwiches or turkey burgers here! I love the fresh smoothies, but they are quite pricey. Smoothies come in a mason size jar with a straw so this means you're getting a very small glass for about $8. But it's one of the only places of it's kind in our area. So if fresh, different and healthful is what you are craving, you will enjoy.",

My being Vegan, this worked out really well.  He had the elephant bowl and a green apple lime refresher.  He was happy with both, the food is pricey but the quantity is good for 2 servings. I had the bountiful bowl which was a little bland but they have some nice hot sauce which spiced it right up.  The quinoa was cooked just right and I was very satisfied with my meal.  We will definitely go again, the Wifi was good too!",

    "text": "We just switched to vegan/plant-strong, so we were excited (and perhaps a bit hesitant) to attempt our first outing into the world of not being in control of cooking our own food. This visit left me comforted that there was at least one excellent vegan restaurant nearby ... AND affirmed our decision to embrace this new way of eating!   I'll start out with the one (potential) negative for us -- it was on the pricey side. My wife and I eat had a standard lunch entree (me -- Elephant Curry Quinoa/Tofu Bowl; her -- Tacos Vivas & Kale Salad), and we shared a smoothie of the day (Blood-Builder -- beet, carrot, OJ, mango, pineapple), and the ticket was $30+. Now, I'm not complaining - it was wonderful food (see my much longer list of positives below!) and huge portions, but still a bit more than I would have typically expected to pay for a weekday lunch for 2. Perhaps -- and I can probably believe it -- vegan/vegetarian is going to consistently cost us more now when we go out ... and if so, and if you're used to this, then this pricing probably wasn't out of the ballpark at all. So, with that in mind, and assuming this to be the case, I didn't let this negatively impact my rating. Will we be back?! Undoubtedly, and most likely often!   Now, for the positives!   Great atmosphere -- Very inviting. Casual and informal. We visited at what was probably the height of the lunch rush on a Friday. Pretty consistent traffic, and tables were available but at a premium. A little loud, but comfortable and simply attributable to people enjoying their meals and each other's company.   Excellent menu -- I was impressed with the variety offered. Choices were described creatively and yet were easily understood. Even us newbie vegans had some questions, though, and the staff were quick to answer and provide input. Granted, it was our first visit, but I really had difficulty deciding what to order, as many options intrigued me. I was completely satisfied with my final choice (Elephant Curry Tofu Bowl) -- hit the spot on a chilly January day in Phoenix! A HUGE selection of smoothies, including a couple of-the-day options. We passed on dessert, but the display case was filled with enticing options, too!   Portion size/value -- My wife and I both were impressed with the portion size. I finished mine (no surprise) but probably could have stopped sooner and been satisfied (did I mention it was SO good, though?!). Her purple-cabbage-bowl tacos were even larger, however, and absolutely overflowing with walnut meat, greens, avocado, and a spicy baja sauce. (Can't wait to test out the walnut \"meat\" with our girls soon...!) She had to leave most of one behind (yes, she did offer it to me, but even I was too stuffed by this point.   Visual appeal -- Everything in the place screamed \"fresh\" and \"healthy\" and \"natural\"! From what ended up on our table (the bright yellow of my curry, the rich purple of my wife's cabbage bowls, and the vibrant magenta of our beet smoothie), to what kept distracting me as they were delivered to a nearby table (huge, freshly layered burgers, piled-high sandwiches, other multi-hued smoothies), and the little peeks behind the counter to the cooler filled with fresh produce and the boatload of fresh veggies and fruit that kept going into the juicer/blender. It really was a smorgasbord for the senses. (My wife and I laughed about previous visual experiences at other \"restaurants\" like Taco Bell, Olive Garden, etc. ... so sad what we've contented ourselves with as a culture.)   Fun factor -- Again, the place was fun and kitschy. Nothing fancy, but clean and bright and full of life. Smoothies are all served in mason-jar-like containers. Tables and chairs are an eclectic mishmash. Self-serve flavored water (cucumber+carrot, I believe?) was a nice touch.   All in all, I loved it. I left feeling good about my meal, good about how I had just invested my time and resources, good about supporting people who obviously cared about what and how they invest in their world, and good about our decision to change the way we eat/live.   Already looking forward to our next visit! (And maybe also to taking a swing at mimicking that curry bowl here at home ... wish me luck!!)",

The food and atmosphere satisfy everything I look for in a cute, neighborhood cafe that is trying to promote not only health but the idea that health tastes GREAT.   The buckwheat english muffin has sent me on a frenzy to find a recipe and bake it myself at home because it was perfect for that lumberjack sammie. The raw collard wrap I had for lunch today was an unexpected slam dunk - hello almond cheese! And I second other reviewer's prop for the orange juice. I want to buy a juicer now.  Answer your temptation at the raw bakery, trust me. Though the only semblance the raw donuts have of a real one is the shape, they still taste delicious. Chocolate cherry \"cheese\" cake? One of my co-diners actually had dessert for breakfast because it was too hard to pass up.  So far I have found no reason to dock points. I will keep returning though with solid determination to get to the bottom of each plate in search of any hint of disappointment. I'm fairly certain I won't find it though.",

Okay - I shouldn't lie, I think we were hesitant because it is a vegetarian restaurant, and we love our meet.  But we were intrigued because of the gluten free options (something that is critical to my husbands health).  Now I am super sad that we waited so long.  We have been missing one of the best restaurants in the Valley.  Both my husband and I had sandwiches for lunch last weekend.  I have never had such distinct flavors in a sandwich before.  It was beyond delicious!!  Maybe getting rid of the meet is critical to really letting my taste buds do their work!!  After lunch my husband and I split their gluten free Tiramisu, and it was HEAVENLY!!!!!!    The staff was super friendly, the service was quick, and the place is very cute and clean.  We will be back very soon (most likely this weekend)!!  I can't wait to share it with all of my friends!!   YUM!!!!!",

    "text": "Update...  After leaving my review the owner got back to me right away and sent me a gift card. My husband and I went back over the weekend and had a drastically different experience. It was somewhat busy but we were seated right away and our waitress greeted us within a few minutes. The food was AMAZING... it has been every time (my previous review was based on service only). This time we got the buffalo cauliflower wings, Cobb salad with BBQ \"chicken\", and the elephant curry burrito. We left feeling very satisfied. I truly appreciate the owner making things right, it shows that they truly care about happy customers. This will remain one of our favorite places and I hope the service continues to improve.   I'm going to start this review by saying Pomegranate Cafe is one of my favorite places but the experience I just had was seriously the WORST!!!   We walked in and it was pretty busy, the hostess told us she wouldn't seat us because the kitchen was backed up (there were plenty of open tables) she said it would be a 15 minute wait and asked if we still wanted to eat there... 15 minutes isn't that long so of course we wanted to stay and she put our name on the list. There was a bunch of people that came in after us that were also waiting to be seated (at this point there's a bunch of open tables) finally after about 20 minutes we get seated but they seated everyone else waiting all at the same time. None of the servers seemed to know what the heck they were doing, it was beyond disorganized. We sat at our table for 15 minutes without anyone coming over and even bringing us water! All of the other tables that came in after us got waters and their orders taken. We were literally being IGNORED!!! Finally my husband went over to a waitress and told her we hadn't even gotten water and how long we had been waiting, her response was \"oh sorry\" and she just went on to do something else. I have NEVER been treated like this in a restaurant!! My husband and I finally just got up and walked out. I am beyond disappointed, we come here every week and to be treated like that was just appalling! I really hope a manager sees this because something needs to be done about this terrible service!!!!!!!!",

It comes on the house biscuit/English muffin and this is a must try, but I also am in love with their house multigrain bread so I'll also get it on this from time to time. I also recommend any of their breakfast scrambles/omelettes. French toast is delish if you're in the mood for sweet breakfast. I'm in love with all of their breads. You'll also want to grab a latte. I usually go for the standard Cassie's latte. Desserts vary and are all good so save a little room. Strangely enough breakfast is so good I've never made it for lunch or dinner, but I have no doubt the meals are great. Customer service is generally great although sometimes they get really busy and appear slightly understaffed. This is one of the few places that I don't feel the need to add the qualifier of its good....\"for a vegan/vegetarian place.\" This place is good no matter what. They are opening a central Phoenix location sometime in the next year are so; luck you central Phoenix peeps. Next time I'm there I'll remember to update with some pictures!",

I didn't notice until I finished. A bit pricier than I'd like for lunch but for fresh, local, vegetarian food I understand. I'd go back if I was nearby to try more items and sample their dessert.",

I first came to pomegranate cafe about 4 years ago and have seen it evolve into a bustling cafe with more options being added all the time.   I have tried multiple menu items and am always satisfied. I tend to lean towards their specials board and raw specials on Friday which always prove to be delicious. I would recommend their daily soup with a TLT Sunizona sandwich if you're going with the permanent menu. As a caution it is a bit pricey but many are willing to pay since everything is fresh, homemade and they source as much produce as possible from local farms. It can also be quite busy during weekday lunch hours and the service may be slow during this time. With that being said it is always worth the wait!",

We try to go for happy hour. My children yell \"Yay\" when we tell them where we're going to eat. Great for gluten free vegetarian and vegan folks. Awesome kids menu.

I was once given a gift card for the price of my meal because an extra ingredient was accidentally added to it.

    "text": "Gone downhill over the years. I'm hoping their new location opening in Jan 2018 will have the level of attention I used to love at Pomegranate cafe.   I visited recently for brunch. We were seated and they had trouble finding menus for the 4 us despite there only being 5-6 full tables in the restaurant. Then we ordered drinks and it took at least 15 minutes for them to pour a glass of wine and make an arnold palmer.   I ordered Cassie's Latte after asking the waiter if it would be super sweet. He said no. Since I'm familiar with their raw/unrefined sugar treats, I knew they likely wouldn't let me down. The latte was actually sickeningly sweet - like Starbucks sweet. As a replacement, I asked for a regular iced latte with coconut milk. This time, there was maybe half a shot of espresso in it instead of the usual two. Plus, I was expecting the style of coconut milk you buy in a carton (aka normal). Instead the milk was more akin to the full fat coconut milk you buy in a can for baking. It's not good on its own in a drink, super gross. There was another woman in the restaurant who sent back a smoothie 3 times so I think the person working the drink station was having a bad day.   We also ordered the shakshuka brunch dish and it took them 10 minutes to tell us they were out of it, requiring us to go through the menu again for a backup.   We ordered a little over an hour before they were scheduled to close for the day. We were also planning to order a few dishes to-go, at the end of our meal. About 35 minutes went by and we hadn't received our food so my husband figured it'd be best to order our to-go items at the takeout counter in front, so they wouldn't close the kitchen for the day first. The man behind the counter said we had to order from our server, despite not having seen him in nearly 40 minutes.   The food finally arrived about 1 hour after sitting down, which seems a little crazy for 4 egg dishes. I ordered soup too and they brought it with my main dish. How hard is it to run a cup of soup out in 45 mins?   We managed to order our to-go food eventually, and that came out way faster than the boxes we requested for leftovers. Saw the waiter laughing in the back with the other servers and talking about hangovers in between serving tables.   Later we tried to order dessert from the waiter but couldn't chase him down. Asked the man behind the counter, he told us once again we had to order from the waiter only.   All-in-all, it took about 1.5 hours for breakfast, which made me really impatient. Nothing they did was outright offensive on its own, but altogether made for a messy dining experience. I really want them to get it together because Pom Cafe has been one of my favorite restaurants in PHX for years.",

The Mac and cheese took 40 minutes (at a non busy time) and was cold when I got it. The j-whatever version of coffee they have along with the Pom milk left much to be desired. I am not a picky person but I had to send it back. Asked for a juice instead and it took 15 MORE minutes to get a lemonade to my table! It sucks because I drove an hour to get here but I definitely will not be back. Skip this cafe and try another one instead.

I moved out of the area to central Phx and have yet to find another place that even comes remotely close. Thus, I drive to get my fix.   It doesn't matter what you order, it is all yummy...but some of my favorites are: Vivos (raw) tacos, root wedges, elephant curry bowl, jalapeno avocado cheese crisp (I requested it folded like a quesadilla),  and any seasonal enchilada. For juices I like the abundance and the wellness shot (warning it has a kick!). And don't forget the desserts! Cowboy bars, Cooke dough truffle, lemon bars and brownies are all ridiculous in a \"mmmm so so good\" kinda way. Oh and the Pom-berry Parfait!

The cinnamon roll was like a biscuit with frosting, not at all like a cinnamon roll. Last time we went we were served \"peppermint mocha\" that was coffee with a ton of mint syrup - totally undrinkable. The happy hour has reduced portions and the burgers are not nearly as good as they were. I use to crave the mushroom burger but not any more. Really sad to see this happen. Used to be a fantastic place and now it's awful.",

I love the drinks, smoothies, juices, and all their food but they lost a star due to their desserts. I love they have vegan and raw desserts but they lack flavor, so this disappoints me with them.....but I really do enjoy everything else. Drinks are a little pricey which is unfortunate but I will treat myself with one when I am here.  They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner here BUT after 8 pm to the last hour open, you can only order food from the counter and everything is served in plastic (take out containers ) that you can eat outside or towards the front even though they close at 9.  My son says the gila nachos are best he has ever had. He LOVES them !  They have a happy hour that you can try some of their small bites / plates til 6 pm, Mon -Fri. Definitely worth it if you want to try some things from the menu.",

    "text": "I got to check our Pomegranate Cafe for the second time ever yesterday (I know - I can't believe I've only been twice!) I am gluten-free, dairy-free and egg-free, so their menu is pretty much a dream for me. They pride themselves on being able to adapt all menu items for customer's allergen needs, which means that if you are gluten-free, you have an ENTIRE menu full of options! Plus, as most of you know, the entire restaurant is vegetarian and mostly vegan (although they do serve eggs and real dairy for those that prefer it).  I got their \"Raw Green Rainbow\" salad, which came with their homemade, dairy-free cashew ranch dressing. It was incredible. My mom got the \"Garden Green Protein Bowl\" with tofu scramble, roasted root veggies, their homemade gluten-free seed toast and homemade POM jelly. We both devoured our food.  Of course, I knew that I wanted dessert, so I stalked the dessert case, asking tons of questions until I could decide which one I wanted. I ended up with the \"Gluten-Free, Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Brownie,\" which was doughy and delicious. Out of all 4 rows of their dessert case, there were 3-4 items that weren't gluten-free - the rest were!  I truly recommend this place for all of my vegan, gluten-free, allergen-friendly seeking customers. I know that feeling of only being able to order 1 thing off the entire menu when visiting most restaurants, but Pomegranate Cafe brings light and life to dining out for those suffering from food allergies, food sensitivities, and/or those with limited diets.  It's worth the trek down to their location in South Phoenix/Ahwatukee area, even if you reside more North. Believe me - It's a one-of-a-kind experience and worth every bite! Gluten-free foodies, unite!   My only request for future is that they offer gluten-free/vegan cakes like the ones they have in their case that are only vegan (not gluten-free). They are so beautiful, fluffy and decadent looking, I would gladly buy a few slices to take home",

Upon my first taste of the burrito, I exclaimed that I wanted to marry it and have its babies. This burrito was equal parts hearty, flavorful and delicious (quite an accomplishment for vegan fare). It arrived nestled next to a strawberry pecan salad and a side of mild salsa. The price was slightly steep, but you can't put a price on happiness. I'll be back soon.",

And the quality of food is just meh - they have a few exceptional items, but for the most part, the food isn't super impressive.  Now let's talk about why they get only 2 stars... their service.  They have this large beautiful dining area indoor and outdoor - but never enough staff to accommodate how many people can fit.  The service has been extremely slow - every. single. time.  Today was a special kind of slow.  It took 2.5 hours from the time we got seated to the time we got our checks.  They offered us free desserts to take home to make up for the long waits, then get this... the server took one of the desserts off our pile (we put them on the counter behind us to save table space) and gave one of our complimentary desserts to another customer!!! And then - they ran out of that specific dessert!!!!! Like who does that?  Also they ran out of another food item I had ordered and substituted it with something else without asking if that is what I wanted.  It was literally insane.  I'm so disappointed with this place now.  I wanted to like them.  If it were only meh food, I probably wouldn't have written a review - but the combo of meh food and terrible service has crossed the line and people should know so they can at least fix the service problem!  If you know it's going to be busy (which it's is every single weekend I have been), make sure you have the staff to accommodate your capacity!!!",

The only thing that I wasn't a big fan of was the big pieces of; I believe it was pepper and onions, but that was my fault since I should have asked what they put in it. It was also pricey, I believe my total came out to $12, but for vegan food that you see them make right in front of you. What do you expect?

Tiny apple slices brought a medley of tastes.  My friends enjoyed their omelets.  The juices were a little funky for me, but if you like a kick of ginger and spices, you'll have plenty to choose from.  The decor is colorful and inviting, and there always seemed to be tables open.  The staff is young and helpful, and seem to enjoy working there.  They patiently help you navigate the menu.  Some aren't quite focused when it comes to fixing mistakes (you wanted which sauce?  um, okay, be back in ten minutes...), but it's more cluelessness than apathy.

That's enough to keep me from ever going back.  (I should have written a review that takes 45 minutes to read, yet you get nothing from it.... kind of like going to Pomegranate)",

The lentil was was okay, but the Athena wrap was really good.  My husband got the breakfast tacos with eggs (I don't remember the name of the dish).  He really liked them, and they were super filling.  He didn't even finish both of them.      Staff takes for granted that you know what is going on.  It's confusing for new customers on where to sit, where you pay or if you refill your own water or not.  The menu also doesn't list all the ingredients in dishes and the servers don't know.  I asked specifically what was in the lentil soup and wasn't told that it has onions.  The food is really good, but the customer service could use some improvement and the prices are a tad expensive, otherwise it would be 5 stars.",

    "text": "Love this place.  Reminds me of the vegetarian places in northern California. I can't say enough good about it.  They will do vegan or vegetarian but don't expect animal meat here (they do have eggs and dairy cheese available as well as tofu, tempah, and other high protein items).  Everything is fresh, fresh, fresh. You get a fair amount of food (often we take some home). The bread is outstanding made from ancient grains.  The food has wonderful taste combinations (e.g. a side salad of cabbage and carrots had fresh ginger in it that made a big difference). How they prepare the food and the taste combinations is what really makes the food great.  They will customize things for you when they can, drinks and food, and can easily accommodate the standard food allergies.  Their hours vary, sometimes they are open in the evenings, sometimes only breakfast and lunch.  Weekend brunch is the busiest so there might be a wait and occasionally on a later evening they have been slow but brought out free tortilla chips which was nice.   They have all sorts of coffees & teas & specialty drinks (hot & cold),  and a case full of deserts, so they are also good to stop by for a coffee.  Dogs are welcome in the outside tables.  One last nice plus, they are a drop off spot for organic farmer co-op shares - sunizonafamilyfarms, where you can get a standard share or pick and choose each week what items you want to order.  We used to stop by about once a week, enough the staff got to know us.  But now we get a farm box and are there a couple times a week - just a nice side effect.",

Unfortunately we extremely let down. We waited 50 minutes for our food (we had the time we ordered on our receipt). As we were waiting we watched others that ordered after us receive their food. We were also amazed at how quick the 'to go' orders were coming in and out.    Finally our food showed up! My wife ordered a breakfast sandwich that she said was a sold 4 out of 5. Unfortunately her potatoes were cold... to the touch cold as if they were sitting out for 20 minute, the waitress  however did offer to microwave them for us though. My breakfast burrito wasn't bad. I wouldn't say it was mind blowing or bad.   Lastly on our way out we heard the waitress apologizing to an older couple that have been waiting as long as we were. They were offering to give them free drinks and a choice out of the desserts to compensate them for their time.",

The $9 price tag seemed a bit high for a juice but thats prob how much all the veggies cost to put in there. Can't wait to go again and try more of their menu options.",

Definitely worth going out of your way for.  Everything on the menu is excellent.  If you can't decide what to get, then go with the Rainbow Wrap and Root Veggie Fries.  I've been a big fan since they first opened. They were amazingly great back then - and since then have gotten even better (and bigger - their original restaurant was eventually so well received and so busy they found a way to expand and more than double the size of the kitchen and restaurant!)  It's inspiring to see the hard work and vision of the owners be rewarded by ever bigger crowds of happy customers (thanks!)",

If your looking for meat of any type this would not be for you unless you want to trip something different.  The raw tacos with the walnut meat are very tasty.  In fact anything with the walnut meat is good.  The bountiful bowl is another winner and you can have quinoa or brown rice in it.  They have many different excellent juices or smoothies to pick from as well.  Since they have a lot of raw desserts it gives a person who is gluten free many delicious options.  My favorite is only made on Fridays and is the tiramisu.  With the exception of the crust is even rivals the gluten version as far as flavor goes.  They are a bit pricey, but since quality matters to me I don't mind paying for it. Should you go always check their hours first because they change at times as they have experimented staying open for dinner.    Customer service is very good.  They want your experience to be good and have you return.    The one recommendation I would make is they really need to keep the bathroom clean!  They have one unisex bathroom with just a very small trash can that is often overflowing and unsightly.  It is actually a good size bathroom, but they have no shelf or some type of table for ladies to place their items on.  They have a small hook on the wall, but if you don't have something with straps then you have to place it on the dirty floor.  Also really please clean the sink.",

Everything is from scratch and is well seasoned and flavored - not something you find very much in this city unfortunately. Even as a meat eater their food is so good that I never feel like I am missing it. They do serve eggs and dairy cheese for breakfast if you prefer.

    "text": "I've been to Pomegranate Cafe a couple times now.  Today I was really inspired to write a review.  The first time I went to Pomegranate Cafe, a neighbor and I popped in for breakfast.  The food was just okay for both of us.  It was nothing special.  I should mention that we both got egg dishes that day, though I can't quite say what we ordered back then.    Today I was low on groceries in the house, so I decided to bring the family here for breakfast.  My daughter ordered the pumpkin bread french toast, which came with fruit (some sliced apples and pears (I think) and a coconut milk ice cream sundae for dessert (topped with Vegan chocolate syrup and Vegan whipped cream).  She loved it, but the portion was quite small.  She is 4 and a light eater and she ate all her french toast in about two minutes.  I cannot imagine an 8 or 10 year old getting filled up on this portion size.  I ordered the Lumberjack (made vegan) with tofu and vegan cheese. The sandwich was just alright, but the accompaniment was pretty yummerific.  I love sweet potatoes and yams, so anything with them included is already a head above!  DH had the teriyaki \"chicken\" bowl and it not only looked fab, it was DELICIOUS.   Needless to say, \"I'll have what (he's) having.\"  Maybe I am just a fan of mock meats!    The expansion is great, but even at 10:30 on a Sunday... The place wasn't packed.    With waters all around, our bill came to $30 post tax and tip.    *Once again, I wasn't thrilled about tipping at the register.  I need to start carrying cash for these situations.   I will definitely be back to Pomegranate Cafe!  I can't wait to try their whole menu. :)",

It took us 40 minutes to get our food which seemed a lot longer than the staff anticipated because they were very apologetic and even gave us a free dessert of our choosing.   The staff was very, very friendly and accommodating, but the wooden chairs and benches were beyond uncomfortable to the the person with back problems who had to sit for an 1-1/2 to eat.

What a bum!  Surprisingly, business was bustling this morning-- I've never seen PC full of people, and get this, there was a LINE waiting to order!

But first, I had to place my order.  Since I'd already perused the menu online, I knew I was going to have the French toast, no powdered sugar, please, like I usually do, but I wanted to try something new.  The basic breakfast (egg, toast, jam, and fruit) enticed, but I quickly drew towards Kamut toast, almond butter, jam, and fruit.  I also thought I'd either try a smoothie or an elixir ($8 each), but the menu online stated to ask for an elixir menu for options.  There was only one, and it was a \"female hormonal concoction\" with something, I lost track, since I didn't need help with my hormones, thank you very much.  (\"Not that there's anything wrong with that.\")  $8 saved.  The smoothie I wanted to try contained pomegranate juice, which I correctly suspected had one or more unwanted ingredients, and for me, that was \"grape seed oil extract.\"  (So glad I spotted those juice bottles in front of the cash register.)  Good- I was able to hang onto $8 of my money.  Last, but not least, I ordered a cappucino (Cartel Coffee) and a glass of water without cucumber.  I again reiterated that I did not want powdered sugar on the French toast, which I was told would take twenty or twenty-five minutes to be ready, since they'd run out of the bread and the next batch was in the oven.  I said it was worth waiting for, so I don't mind, and besides, I'll have the kamut toast and almond butter.  As I paid for my three items, I was told that my food will be out in about 30 minutes, which took me by surprise, but I was in no mood to make a fuss, especially when I needed to secure an empty table before someone else snatched it!  I found one outdoors, but it needed bussing.  No problem, as I found a shy and cute associate to help me.  One thing I really like about frequenting vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free venues, is how most, if not all, of the staff members are so humble, and are good-natured.  Another thing is that these venues tend to look so hippy-chic, colorful, eclectic, and FUN!  I loved the different swaths of colorful curtains, brightly-painted tables and chairs, whimsical dinnerware, and that was indoors!  Outside, I found a mosaic two-top with mismatched chairs- I sat on the one without the morsel of food on its seat.  The food didn't take quite as long as 30 minutes.  The cappucino <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=b5c0q6siFAHnRWC5FU3TYw#b5c0q6siFAHnRWC5FU3TYw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6...</a> took a few minutes to arrive, and so did the lovely-tasting city water, nicely contained in a lidless canning jar.  (There's a reason cucumber slices are used to \"flavor\" the water, folks!)  It was about ten minutes after I started sipping my coffee that the Banana bread French toast arrived <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=ZPZ8wSo4IPOrtAmFWejCcw#ZPZ8wSo4IPOrtAmFWejCcw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6...</a>, but it was sprinkled with powdered sugar!  However, Russell did not hesitate in taking it back and bringing another.  What terrific service!  The Kamut toast, almond butter, jam, and fruit plate stayed, however, so I was happy. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=s3KbSXITa6YEFvYgGYv91g#s3KbSXITa6YEFvYgGYv91g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6...</a>  Still happy, even when I found out that the almond butter was the raw variety-- I don't particularly like its flavor, or lack thereof, and I only buy and enjoy the roasted kind.  It's a good thing I am not allergic to chia (still experimenting), sesame, and sunflower seeds, for while the menu did not mention these were included, one certainly could not avoid their presence on this dish!  It's also a good thing they were, since they gave the bland-tasting almond butter much-needed flavor.  The fun textures on this dish also gave my mouth something to be happy about!  The Banana bread French toast arrived about 5 minutes later, and what a marvel that was! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=vfafsHCzso2InWi-kcDWBg#vfafsHCzso2InWi-kcDWBg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6...</a>  The French toast had the PERFECT crunch on the outside, a gorgeous pound-cake-meets-angel-cake consistency on the inside, and a wonderful roasted-banana scent filled the air around my face that soon delighted my taste buds!  The strawberry-rhubarb jam and agave pancake syrup added lovely velvety coats of sweetness and colors, as well.  I could've eaten the entire dish!  I'll be back!",

They've continued to expand their dining area over the years to accommodate more customers and now have full service waiters so you can sit down and take time to look over the menu. My fiance and I ordered the breakfast pizza special which was amazing. It had this homemade croissant-like crust with scrambled eggs, hash, tempeh bacon & a delicious cashew cheese that has a little kick to it. I would definitely go back and order this again. It's a good size to split w/ someone and have room for juice still. If you're looking for outdoor dining they have a good size patio and its located next to Trader Joe's which makes it convenient to grab a couple groceries after you eat.",

The entire staff is incredibly friendly and helpful whenever I venture in for breakfast or lunch.  There are lots of new faces here now, but the service and friendly vibe are all still in full force. They always seem to know everyone. They have a dedicated following, but they are just as nice to new comers. I try and bring all of my friends and family even though none are vegetarian.   They have seriously killer breakfast foods. The top being the Lumber Jack Sandwich though their breakfast specials have never disappointed me. Be on the lookout for their special pancakes and the vegetarian \"Sausage Biscuits\" and gravy. My personal favorite lunch food is the RAW Tacos which have walnut taco meat ( yeah I know it's still fantastic).  They are the offspring of amazingly delicious mexican food and a salad.  If you don't know what to get just ask. They are always super helpful at explaining things and making great suggestions or just get something from the vegan desert case everything is awesome.  Try:  - Lumber Jack Sandwich - RAW Tacos - Mocha - Breakfast Specials - Passion Juice - Chocolate Banana Muffins - Snickers Bars - Hummus",

It had a bitter and spicy note that threw me off.  The pink cake was a little soggy.    The decor is weird.  I can see what they are trying to do, but it would create a nicer atmosphere if they would get rid of the florescent ceiling lights.  The staff is totally spaced out.

    "text": "This restaurant almost killed me! As a vegan who is allergic to cashews I am very careful when I go to a vegan restaurant because I know cashews tend to be hidden in a lot of vegan creamy sauces as a cheese substitute. I asked about cashews before ordering, and I asked again when my food arrived. I was assured that the vegan ranch was sunflower based, but when I put it to my lips they ballooned up and were immediately on fire. Thank god I didn't actually put anything in my mouth or swallow a bite of food. I walked up to the kitchen and asked the waiter again, and he still said it was sunflower based, along with one of his coworkers who agreed. I asked him to ask the chef to be sure (because I knew I was already having a reaction) and he finally went to go check. Sure enough, THREE of the items I ordered had cashews. Vegan ranch in my appetizer, in the wrap I ordered, and cashews in the potato salad I ordered as my side. 1. Who puts cashews in potato salad? 2. I ASKED THREE TIMES! The server kept repeating over and over that he was on vacation for 20 days and they changed the menu around while he was gone.  Fine, but then why didn't he check with the chef the FIRST time I asked? He tried to charge us for the full meal even though I was too busy wheezing to eat. My husband refused to pay for food that I was too sick to touch and asked for the manager. The waiter took my food off of the bill but would not get the manager. So here I am posting on Yelp in the hope that someone from management will see this and realize how serious food allergies are. If you're going to hide nuts in almost every dish on your menu and not educate your staff when you change recipes then you really need to have an allergen guide on your menu so customers can help themselves. I was able to treat myself quickly for the anaphylactic reaction that this restaurant's negligence caused but the next person might not be so lucky. I might not have been so lucky if I had actually swallowed a bite. If you have food allergies do not go to this restaurant because they do not take it seriously.",

Luckily, Pomegranate Cafe was right down the road so we ended up stopping in to try it out.  Great menu and friendly staff. The food was good. We got our food before we got our drinks, which makes sense when you're ordering fresh squeezed juices... so had to wait a bit to start eating. The man was thrilled to find out that they offered a dairy version of the breakfast burrito so he could still eat healthy but didn't have to eat completely vegan.   My fresh squeezed orange juice and kale salad (kale, tomato, beet curls, carrots) was a nice, clean and healthy meal to start off the day.  The space was decorated cutely, and they even offer a few products for sale which are great products, such as Sun Warrior vegan protein powder. Will definitely return to try out a few more menu items!",

Finally I got up and got us menus then the host came over with waters 20 minutes later. Almost a half hour later we get a waitress. We of course order right away. A smoothie bowl, cinnamon roll and a green goddess burger. The food was great which is why I'm giving this a 2 star. However we got the smoothie bowl first then 7-8 minutes later we got the burger and about 15 minutes later we got the cinnamon roll. Nothing came out together. I don't know if they make the cinnamon roll from scratch as people order but it should not have taken almost a half an hour for a cinnamon roll. Never once were we asked if we wanted anything to drink other then the host bringing us waters. The service was beyond horrible however the food was really good!!!!!",

The inside really feels like a welcoming, family vibe with the creative decor like the huge family table with different colored chairs, to the old bar wood style counter.  We had the Buffalo Cauliflower, Tu-Nut sandwich (omg the bread!), Gila Monster Nachos. And a yummy Cowgirl cookie!  Y'all, just go there. You won't regret it. Some of the menu items, such as the Elephant Bowl, donate a portion of the price to Elephant Care Uncained. I mean, why not eat delicious food and support a worthy cause?  Y'all, just go there. You won't be sorry.   (Ps I didn't get a picture of my food because it wasn't around long enough)",

I went with a non-white friend of mine and sat outside on the patio, on a not very busy morning for the restaurant. Our waiter took our order, brought our drinks, and we did not see him for over 35 min after that. People who were seated after us receivedtheir orders and finished their food before we ever got ours. We did not order anything special.  After we finally got our food, about 45min later, He never came back to check on us. We kept being pestered by a pigeon so we stopped the waiter as he was done helping another couple, to ask if we can move inside. He said yes and did not offer to help us move, give us a table, or check on us to see if we needed anything.  I have never had service like that before. As I said this particular servicer is not the greatest but service that morning was the worst. The only difference is I had my non-white friend with me.",

The tacos are a win-win (raw or cooked) I didn't have a smoothie here that I didn't like. The raw bagel sandwich will surprise your socks off, and the Athenas favorite is called a favorite for a reason. The raw snickers bar is good when they put the right amount of coconut.

    "text": "After a few straight days of eating pretty poorly, the fella was craving a healthy meat-less meal for breakfast. A quick yelp search for healthy food with gluten free options led us to Pomegranate Cafe. I had a few of their desserts at Sips and Sweets last year, but had never made it out for a full meal.   Tucked away in a shopping plaza, Pomegranate is shockingly spacious. They have a good sized patio that allows dogs, with big roomy tables. At 9am on a Sunday, it was pretty full but not crowded, and the handful of open tables meant we didn't have to wait to be seated. Walking in, the hostess stand is to the right hand side just inside the door. It makes for a little bit of an awkward situation when there are more than two parties waiting to be seated, as there's not much waiting space. The hostesses seemed a little disoriented and scattered, but after a few minutes we were sat and waters (with cucumber!) delivered.   Our server also seemed a little bit flustered, but came over to take our order pretty quickly. I opted for the Avocado Sandwich with Farm eggs (+$1), and the dude had the Sunshine Wrap in the green collard leaf (he can't have gluten) and the rainbow juice. My avocado sandwich was great; all of the flavors played together really well, and in my opinion, sprouts are grossly underrated. My chief complaint about the sandwich was the bread. While it was DELICIOUS--seriously, I love any and all bread, but this was top-notch--it wasn't a hearty enough bread to hold the weight of the sandwich. I ended up abandoning and deconstructing it because the pesto was exploding out of the bread. Plus, while very yummy, this amount of pesto really just wasn't meant to be spread directly on an already weak bread--spread that love between the eggs and sprouts, yo. Super tasty, but not structurally sound. But I cannot fault them for my own sandwich neuroses, I fully realize that I have some irrational hangups. The fella said his wrap was really tasty, but had a similar problem with the wrap's ability to contain the innards. The rainbow juice was excellent.   After enjoying our meal, we took a stroll on over to the dessert counter so the fella could pick out some treats; dairy free, gluten free treats are pretty hard for him to find, so he jumps at the opportunity every chance he gets. We were waiting quite a while before we were helped, and then the employees helping us seemed a little... indignant. We ordered one of the snickers bars, which was clearly labeled in the case; it was very poorly explained to us that what was in the case were actually almond joys, and snickers would not be ready today. That's fine, we weren't upset and we weren't looking for an apology or anything, and totally understand that this kind of stuff happens. But the perceived annoyance towards us was a little off putting, when we were just trying to pick a couple things up and head on our way. The whole process probably took 15-20 minutes.   Overall, food was excellent but a little pricy. Service could use a bit of help. We'll probably be back, but hope the dodgy service this go-around was just a fluke.",

No one ever came out and took our order, or gave us water or to even say they were busy and will be right with us. Over 20 mins we sat there, we had plenty of time to look over the menu and decide what we wanted. But after that much time and still getting up to walk away not one person noticed or even seemed to care. I am glad they are a busy establishment, but if you are too busy for new clientele we will gladly give another restaurant our business.",

In fact, BBQ is one of my hobbies. Don't let the vegan menu scare you off. The food was absolutely fantastic. They do offer eggs and cheese if you need to get some protein and our server knew all about the menu and ingredients.   My wife and son had the banana bread French toast. My wife is allergic to strawberries, and asked to leave them off. Andrew, our server, actually noted on the ticket that there was a food allergy to ensure no cross contamination. Very grateful, and other restaurants could learn from that practice. I had the cheddar biscuits with vegan chorizo gravy. It was outstanding.   Can't believe I took so long to try this place. We'll be back...especially to try the mushroom and poblano street tacos!",

I was extremely pleased when the family said there was a great new cafe, just a few short minutes from their home! When the omnivore fam try it on their own accord, it really means something.  I visited Pomegranate Cafe for brunch and had the biscuits and gravy. Huge portion with tofu scramble and root veggies! It was great. The menu is extensive, so it was a hard decision. I also had the lavender coconut latte. Highly recommended. I wanted dessert but was way too full and even took leftovers home.  The outdoor seating is cute and shaded, and our server was sweet and attentive. I wish Pomegranate was in my home city. PC- If you're looking to add another location, please consider Bay City Michigan... and leave the eggs off the menu. :)",

The waitress was highly attentive to everyone but us (IT WAS NOT BUSY). She was chatting up other customers, took the order of another table who sat down after us, and never filled our waters. Quite often, she was standing idly.   She only asked us if our food was okay when it was obvious that we didn't think it was.  Now to the food...  We ordered the nachos (best part of the meal... but you can't really screw up nachos), buffalo cauliflower taco (too spicy, I'm Asian and eat a lot of spicy, but that was all spicy and no flavor), pumpkin fudge brownie (aight but boring), and a slice of pumpkin chocolate cheesecake (so bad, and it was their recommendation!!!).   After letting her know about the least pleasurable parts of our meal (buffalo cauliflower and cheesecake), she took it off our bill. So thank you! But then it took her another 15 minutes to get the check... because she just forgot. So no thanks!   Also it looks like some new waitress was shadowing her... terrible idea if the owners just want to perpetuate BAD service.  Instead of going here, please go to Trader Joe's next door, buy some groceries, and make better quality food @ a lower price AT HOME.",

I was convinced if I found a few items on the menu I loved it would make it completely worth it, there are not very many vegan restaurants like this so I was willing to give it a second and even third chance if I had to. The menu is a tad bit big so it was hard to decide what I wanted to try, and some of the descriptions for the food were off. For example, I ordered the curry and expected something like a traditional thai curry but it was more of a rice bowl with curry seasoning.  Their vegan mac and cheese is amazing, I also love anything that includes their home made bread. I actually usually order the english muffin pizza off of the kids menu because it is the perfect portion, it costs less then the typical meal here, and it is simple. The Jnantik Mocha is amazing, and so are the deserts!",

My wife sandwich was cold,it was a Avocado Sandwich, the bread hard as a rock with 4 mini slices of green apple and a dirty plate,like no care to show pride on plating food.

We sat for a little with only one menu and then had to ask for more after being asked if we were ready to order. The waitress brought us waters but didn't ask for a drink order.  Once we ordered our food it took 45 minutes for us to get our food. The waitress didn't come by to tell us it was going to take awhile until we asked where our food was. When we asked what was taking so long, the waitress informed us there was only one cook. One cook on a Saturday night!! The food was good, not great and it definitely didn't make up for the bad service.",

The coffee was pleasantly surprising. When I saw the big dispensers and the self serve coffee I was skeptical. The coffee was GREAT. I drink my coffee black and the flavor was awesome.   Next, the food: I got the breakfast tacos with eggs (rather than tofu) and no cheese. The veggies were awesome! The salsa and the guac were perfect touches and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.

    "text": "QUICK AND HEALTHY, BUT I'M STILL HUNGRY :(  The Pomegranate Cafe is a cheery place to have a quick light lunch - emphasis on light.  I was excited to see so many leafy greens in a lighted refrigerator case - these would be showcased in my lunch as I had the soup and salad combo.  The Ultimate \"un-chicken\" Ceaser Salad and a butternut squash and chickpea minestrone cup of soup had an wonderful variety of colors and textures to make my mouth sing - but after finishing, I admit that I was neither stuffed nor satisfied.  So I got a Larabar from the Trader Joe's next door.    Overall, I'd like to go again to try something else on the menu, but I'll definitely go on a day where I need or want to eat something light.",

    "text": "I hate giving this place a bad review, because the concept is so great.  Healthy food in Ahwatukee.  We were excited to go try it.  But since I'm so sensitive to things, we just got some appetizers to see how it went.  It was delicious.  A little too delicious (the hummus, I think was the main culprit).  We got into the car and went to the nearby park.  I started feeling sick.  Lightheaded, sleepy, out of breath, thirsty as hell.  My friend got a runny nose and headache.  He said \"I get a runny nose and headache from MSG\".  I was like \"yeah, I get all these things I\"m feeling, from MSG, too.\"  Now \"healthy\" places like Whole Foods can and will claim there's no MSG in their food, because they use some other kind of glutamate, which is the same thing by a different name (ie hydrolyzed yeast, etc.).  There was no denying it, when we got the symptoms at the same time.   We thought back and realized the hummus was over the top tasty unlike a hummus I've ever had before (except once at a Farmer's Market, and they used MSG, too, listed as \"spices\"). They must get a star, I will give that to their organic juice I  got once before because it tasted great, and I felt great afterward.  But it was a bit on the expensive side.",

But overtime, they really have IMPROVED-they vamped up the menu and the service is MUCH better. So kudos to them! My favorites are Arizona Rolls and Living Caesar Salad as well as their smoothies and coffee! I am happy to say I go there once or twice/week-their vegan selections are delicious! I'm also glad that it is conveniently located in my area.",

If your looking for a place that says they make natural foods but uses 2nd rate ingredients and comes up with recipes to hide the fact by using spices to cover it up your better off going somewhere else. My family took me here when we were visiting, and it is wonderful. I had the Pesto Presto sandwich and it was divine! I also tried my family's strawberry fields salad and Arizona rolls. They were all really good. The vegetables were fresh and high quality and the price for the portion and quality was a good price. I was amazed that they had a couple of options for people on the raw foods diet. The juices are different, but surprisingly refreshing. This place is a great example that eating well and health can be tasty and satisfying.",

What I love most about this place is that it is 100% Vegetarian with almost everything on the menu having the ability to be made vegan by replacing things like cheese and sour cream with a vegan option (I've never been anywhere that actually offered vegan sour cream so that was exciting!). The first time I tried the Lumber Jack - it was okay, but I think the texture of the tempeh bacon is what threw me off. I also tried their cowgirl cookie the first time and it's phenomenal! ALL of their baked goods are vegan (and some are raw/vegan). The second time we went I had their breakfast burrito w/ vegan cheese and vegan sour cream and it was excellent! Also, the teas they serve are amazing. I suggest the white peony - perfect, lightly fruity, breakfast tea. We will be back to try lunch!",

Before my recent vistit and any time I've gone there they always got my food out looking excellent, taste is amazing (however not consistent). The wait time doesn't bother me, I'm paying for good food I don't mind waiting. I ordered a TOGO of what I usually get and a smoothie that I've gotten before that I really liked. When I got home the smoothie had an after taste of barf, and the food was not good at all. I've gotten it a lot of times before so I'm not sure if they changed the vegan cheese on it or what happened. But it had this orange colored chesse on it and it didn't do the food any justice, didn't taste great at all. I ordered the vegan cheese, but it really looked and tasted like normal cheese. I am really disappointed, I spent a good amount of money on what I thought would be good food. I didn't spend the money so people could mess up on my food/drink. I would have rather them tell me they fucked up my order and spend the extra time making it right rather than getting it out as quickly as possible. I find the best service is around 4-closing. The morning service is just not that great.",

I've had the dragon bowl, curry bowl, green burrito, several salads, and a vegan baked good or two... all were excellent. Their order taking and table service process on the other hand is a complete disaster. All orders are taken at the register and you are given a laminated tarot card of sorts to identify your table to the server. I've never been in a restaurant that takes so long to ring up orders. I'm not sure if it's because the menu isn't conventional and people always have questions, or if it's their iPad POS system or if it's the fact that they have to sort three separate pieces of paper in order to keep record of open orders and sales. Either way, it results in a huge backlog of customers. The tarot card system is sort of funny because there are always servers walking around in a fog with food or drinks in their hands searching for these cards or someone with an expectant look in their eyes. More often than not, you'll be offered food that you haven't ordered before you get the food that you did. Lucky for them, they put out great food, and I'm able to view these frustrations as mere quirks that match the staff's friendly, quirky disposition.",

I also love the breakfast protein bowl and have tried some of their raw selections - all so delicious! Everything is homemade, organic and a lot of the food is locally sourced.   Yes, this won't be an $5 footlong but like others have said organic, fresh food is pricey. I buy it for my kitchen. I would rather pay more to eat food that is good for my body and that is truly natural. Thanks Pomegranate!!",

However, I do enjoy Vegan/vegetarian food as well which drew me to Pomegranate Cafe when I lived on the east side.   To be honest, Pomegranate Cafe is an acquired taste.  It's not for everyone as with most restaurants similar. The food is organic and non processed and most dishes I have tried has an \"earthy\" taste.  The juices are freshly made and is exactly that JUICE. No additives, sugars necessary.  You get the full nutrients from the food you're eating/drinking.   Whenever I come here (2-3 times/mo), I usually get the Lumberjack, hearty and delicious. I get it vegan even though a non vegan is available (when in Rome).  I also order the Abundance, a mean unpleasant looking green juice that is beyond delicious.  If I have room, as the portions are generous, I'll share dessert with friends.     As I've stated earlier, this place is not for everyone.  The prices are on the higher side, but for what you get, it's well worth it. Can you spend the same amount of money and get 25 cheeseburgers from McDonalds? Sure. If that's the case, then you have wasted your time reading this review. If you want a different culinary experience with healthy food, knowledgable staff, and relaxed ambiance, then give Pomegranate a try!",

    "text": "It's good to have vegetarian/vegan/raw options in this neck of the woods; they're not that common.    Raw food can be pricey; some of the key ingredients are expensive and if the kitchen is making items like \"raw cheese\", it's labor intensive.  The food was good to great.  i had the raw tacos and got my daughter the kids scrambled eggs, which seems like a good value for the nice sized portion of eggs, about a half an apple, two pieces of wheat toast and an ice cream cup.  Here's the part that was off-putting:  Standing at the bountiful raw/vegan/gf pastry bar, waiting a bit for the ice cream to-go, I wondered aloud to the manager/owner/hostess (not sure) about how the raw chocolate-looking items were processed.  She explained a bit how it was from \"raw cacao powder\" mixed with etc, and asked at some point in the exchange if I was familiar with raw food diet.  Not quite sure how that was relevant to my question, but it set a bit of an us/them polarity to the conversation.  And yes, I've done 2 longish stints of raw vegan diet.    I pressed on the processing of \"raw cacao nibs\", as I've visited a couple of chocolate farms and the processing I learned of included roasting the beans; they're inedible otherwise. She replied that they weren't roasted, and they're certified raw, and \"oh, you haven't heard of raw cacao powder?\".  Again, fairly irrelevant to my question, and yes, I know it's a common ingredient in raw desserts. Maybe it seemed like I was questioning the integrity of the restaurant, which caused her to be so defensive, but I was asking in the spirit of learning a bit more from a (hopefully) educated raw food professional. I shutdown when she mentioned the beans weren't roasted, bc I know enough about the process to know that they HAVE to be.  It was good to dig a little bit more into the  subject online today, to find out that the questions I asked are actually active debates within the community, ie:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnourishmylife.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F04%2F24%2Fraw-cacao-vs-cocoa%2F&s=4913cc66e37f400075bfbf831770912cee2598d1ad4755b0a59181dfb1c56393\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">nourishmylife.wordpress....</a>  Raw food eating, i think, necessarily causes its participants to be more mindful, and therefore, more educated about their eating and food sources and the processes involved and sourcing.  I would love to see Pomegranate, and its staff, as True educators of this type of eating in the very suburban suburbs that the restaurant is located in.  Unfortunately, this wasn't my experience today.",

    "text": "I have to start by saying the food is fantastic. My main issue is that these guys can't seem to figure out how to run a kitchen. Every time we go they have a back up in the kitchen and you wait a minimum of 45 minutes to an hour for your food. Because they can't figure out their kitchen then the wait times for a table are 45-60 minutes on a Saturday or Sunday. I could understand having growing pains and correcting the issues but they don't seem to understand how to get a handle on it. This place could be a gold mine if they could turn out food faster and turn tables. If I was a server there I would be extremely frustrated because that is my livelihood and it may affect their tips (I always tip 20% or more).  I can't understand how the new location will be successful considering the problems they have at this location. Why not focus on one location and make it perfect before moving onto opening a new location. Such a shame because as I said food here is the bomb but you have to come with allot of patience and low expectations for service time.",

They offer a great selection of vegan and raw vegan food, and while the vegan choices do offer a few comfort food items for the meat-eating-boyfriend-types, most of the menu is fairly healthy. As a mostly raw vegan, I did appreciate their raw selections, although I admit I went weak and had to try their daily burger, which was absolutely delicious!  They also have an eclectic dessert selection, which I resisted, but looked splendid.  I am sure that I will return here anytime I am in Phoenix.",

For an all vegetarian/vegan restaurant, I've got to say that they're doing excellent. I recommend this to anyone coming to the Phoenix area! I've brought my friends, and even my father, who lives out of town and is the pickiest eater, and he even agrees that the food was delicious, along with their coffee. Needless to say they deserve 6 stars. It's a busy little place and they've renovated multiple times to keep up with the growing traffic.

They told us about the 100% organic and seasonal menu. The Meatloaf sliders were AMAZING. They had the familiar taste and texture of meatloaf.

The flavor was amazing and the pita bread was great for the hummus and pesto. I must also say that the restaurant is so adorable! They have the cutest tables with great center pieces. I noticed on the way out that they have herb boxes out front amongst the outdoor seating. The desert case is to die for and I gave into temptation and left with a slice of carrot cake AND a brownie. I know, I was really bad! The thing that impressed me the most about this place (besides the vegan food) is that they are so nice! Everyone there was so social and made me feel right at home.

Tried their coffe since it was peixoto beans and was not to fond of their lattes as it is hard to hold a candle to the original coffee shop. The hibiscus cooler is solid! Great and refreshing . The magic coffee is very different for a latte not really my favorite . Just noticed they serve nitro coffee and will have to try next.",

    "text": "On the one hand... I love the ranchero skillet. Its freaking delicious and I have had it more than a few times. Its super filling, and the last time I ate it, I even got full halfway through it and had enough for leftovers this morning. Its well worth the $10.50 it costs.  On the other hand.... If I buy a piece of $6.00 cake, I expect to get fresh cake. Not the leftovers from yesterday that are hard, dry and stale. We took a piece of cake to go to eat later and was given a piece leftover from what I can only assume was from the day before that was hard and unappetizing. We did not enjoy it at all. If you must insist on selling day old cake, sell if for less than the asking price of the good, fresh cake. Its almost thievery to sell a product of less quality for the same price as the fresh product.",

I am not 100% positive it was from this place, but given the timing and the fact that this was the only place where my girlfriend didn't eat the same thing I did, I'm pretty damn sure. I had a vegetable juice with a salad and my guess is they either didn't wash the veggies well enough or aren't washing their hands/equipment well enough. It's been almost 1 week and I am still experiencing symptoms. Considering how sick I got from this place I will probably never eat there again. Caution!!!!  If you have been sick from this place as well, please report them to the county health department so no one else has to go through the same thing.",

    "text": "I went here today and enjoyed it quite a bit. The food is fresh, healthy, and still manages to be indulgent. The vegetables are local and taste so good. The flavors they achieve are something special.   For my entree I had a tahini eggplant burger. It came with lots of greens (I think arugula and kale?) as well as some type of creamy sauce and some other toppings like tomato, sprouts, etc. The bun was flavorful and had good texture, something that is unusual for most vegan buns. It came with a side of potato coins (fried potato slices) and house made BBQ sauce, hummus and veggies (hummus was Indian spice flavor and the veggies were bell pepper, cucumber and a whole purple carrot). The hummus was sort of strangely grainy and chunky, which was not what I was expecting. It ended up tasting nothing like hummus really, but was still good as a veggie dip. The vegetables were crisp and fresh.   We ordered a tiramisu (layers of coffee cream, date nut layers and cream) which was incredibly delicious. I am not vegan and normally approach vegan baking with a lot of skepticism as it is often far out of my comfort zone, but as long as you have an open mind, you'll be pleasantly surprised with what Pomegranate has to offer. The tiramisu tasted like coconut, coffee, cream and HEAVEN. The layers of date nut stuff were slightly chewy and had a vaguely caramel like flavor. It came with some chocolate sauce and strawberries and was on the whole really good.  However, there are some downsides to the experience. The atmosphere is cute enough but it was crowded, noisy, and the space is not that large. The decorations are bright and cheerful but it had a vaguely cafeteria-ish vibe due to the tables being very close together. Water is self-serve. You order at a counter and the service is similar to other fast-casual places. We ordered the tiramisu for dessert and it never arrived, and we had to go back to the counter to ask for it. We waited for another long time and finally someone came to tell us the tiramisu was frozen, and that we could eat it frozen or try something else out of the dessert case.  While it wasn't a problem for it to be frozen, the whole losing our order and then not having the item in the correct condition was frustrating. While at the counter, another person had the same thing happen to their group as well.  The prices are also really high for the portion size. I get that the food is really high quality, and it certainly tastes like it, but my burger was the size of a regular burger and cost $12. With tax and tip my bill came to more than $15 just my entree and a glass of water. My friend picked up the tab for the dessert, around $4-5, and her breakfast platter entree was $10 so her bill was about the same.  Overall it was a good experience and I liked the food, but for the price, I am hesitating on whether to go back or not.",

    "text": "Breakfast and lunch cafe with good coffee (each order receives its own French Press!). It's a vegetarian cafe, but don't let that scare you away. The food is very good.  I blindly stumbled upon this place without a clue as to what it was about. So, as I was perusing the menu -- scanning, scanning -- I was anxiously asking myself, \"Where's the meat?!\" Ahhh...ok; there is none. I played it cool though, like I knew this fact already, and I ordered the In Season Scramble for $8.  When my meal arrived (see picture), I was blown away! This was hearty...and delicious! Meat be damned! Who needs it? This was great stuff. The portion was generous; the flavors were exciting -- fresh and yet savory. Even the toast was very good. Oh, and the Harvest (potato & sweet potato) Hash...excellent!  The coffee was good too. They give each order it's own French Press with a mini hourglass: when the sand runs out, press down and enjoy. The coffee roast is a lot lighter than what I typically drink. It wasn't smoky or bold; instead it was light with pleasant fruit backnotes. It wasn't bad, but perhaps a hearty French Roast in the French Press would be perfect.  Overall, I'm a fan. I'll be back. I can put aside my carnivorous ways occasionally and support the Pomegranate Cafe's local, organic (and flavorful) philosophy. I wish this place the best.",

I do mean it was AAAMMAZIIIING!!  Seriously, the Tempeh Bacon was practically like tender BBQ Beef Brisket, it was quite a magical moment for my taste buds.   My salad came with a side of Living Caesar dressing, which is all raw vegan ingredients, it was a little spicy for my taste so I asked for the Pomegranate vinaigrette, YUM! Sweet, Tangy and a little zing from some fresh mint it was much more to my liking.   I'm just ecstatic that there is something so Veganly Delicious ( it's my review so I will make up words if I want to)) so close to home.   4 stars for now, until I try more items, but that sandwich was so 5 stars!",

Five minutes later the hostess came outside and told one of the other people who came after us that there was a table available if they wanted it. Our table was right next to theirs. So why did she ask them and not us. But those people decided to stay outside. I went in to use the restroom and there were 4 tables ready. I told the hostess and she said she did not know.

    "text": "Love that there are tons of vegetarian, vegan and raw options, and the recipes are different than what you'd expect. They regularly update their menu. The first time I went there they had different types of bowls, burritos, sandwiches, smoothies, juices. They even have a bakery up front. The decor is cute, pomegranate-themed of course, but not in your face. (They even put pomegranate seeds in your water!) The backs of the chairs have enticing words like \"fresh,\" and \"natural.\" You really feel like a lot of love was put into the cafe to provide people with fresh organic food.   They do have mock meat but they have descriptions of what it is made out of. I had the kelp noodle bowl which had clear kelp noodles, mushrooms and marinated tofu. My friend had the sushi (no meat)... sooooo good! The employees are very nice and helpful. Unfortunately, the second time my boyfriend and I decided to go, we arrived after 4pm on a weekday, which is the time they closed. So disappointing! Instead, we had to go to the Mexican restaurant in the shopping center. I would also like to point out that the placement of the cafe is spot on as far as the trend of natural healthy living because it's next to Trader Joe's, a natural pet food store and a yoga studio.",

I tried their cashew nachos and was blown away. I never knew replacing meat with cashew nuts would be such a winning combination. Then came my blueberry lavender smoothie, blown away again. Lastly came my main dish, an avocado sandwich with house-made focaccia bread, eggs (they gave me the option of no eggs) and a pepita (pumpkin seed) pesto. Blown away yet again!

    "text": "So... I think Pomegranate and I might have more than a spring fling. I don't want to jinx it, but this could be really serious. I introduced Pomegranate to my mom, my best friends, and even my current boyfriend, but everyone agrees, they can see me spending the rest of my life with Pomegranate. Here's my recount of our classic love story, one dish at a time.  I knew I'd fallen after tasting the Strawberry Rhubarb French Toast (griddle-dipped banana bread, drizzled in rhubarb sauce, strawberries, and topped with cream) Then, the Tiramisu (coconut-based espresso, cream, and date-nut crust layers) sent me head over heels. The Breakfast Burrito left me satisfied, but didn't create that same spark that the flavorful Ranchero Skillet once did. Luckily, the hemp milk latte and famous cowgirl cookie quickly helped me remember why I committed to Pomegranate in the first place.  Our relationship moved to a new level - raw - a few months ago. The rainbow wrap was ridiculously huge and filling (much more so than the basic, but tasty, Mediterranean wrap). It was almost more than I could handle. I tossed the bland Indian sweet potato hummus it came with and focused on what really mattered... finishing the wrap. I cared too much not to. After stuffing myself into oblivion, Pomegranate surprised me with a coffee-choco-nana & coconut milk ice cream shake afterward... topped with crushed chocolate-almond pillows. Within seconds of my first spoonful, the fire was back, and burning hotter than ever.  Shortly afterwards, I fell into a confused rut, messing around with vegan meats and cheeses of all varieties. The southwestern mac 'n' cheese, much like the Philly cheese steak, tantalized me with its decadence, but left me feeling sick and low afterwards. Even the delicious, nutritious teriyaki chicken bowl, brimming with sprouts, veggies and quinoa, was only posing as Mr. Right. Tainted by the presence of faux-chicken, I shied away after only two rendezvouses. Not even dessert could lure me back, for both the chocolate cake (dry) and almond butter square (boring) were a disappointment.  It was all my fault. What was I thinking? A few weeks later, I rushed back, determined to mend the gaping hole in my heart. I downed the mushroom bisque and half a pesto presto sandwich (Kamut baguette, fresh avocado, pesto, fresh veggies) in under five minutes. Oh, how I missed the fresh ingredients, the whole foods, the homemade flavor in every bite. Still, I needed some sugar after being away. Lucky for me, the Cannoli (brulee'd sugar shell, cashew cream filling, dark chocolate chips, and berry sauce), not only provided that, but was better than any Cannoli I'd ever had. And I've had a fair share of Cannolis in my day. What more can a girl ask for?   Pomegranate, I do.",

    "text": "I am completely infatuated with this cafe. I live in Orange County where the raw vegan vegetable restaurant selection isn't so up to par.  Yes, yes, I know it is a nieche market but asking for a fresh healthy vegetable selection when eating out shouldnt be like pulling teeth. Sure we have Native Foods, Au Lac, and 118 degrees but Pomegranate Cafe has captured my heart. The atmosphere is completely unintimidating and the owner is perhaps the most delightful woman I've ever spoken to. She is so personable and I'm pretty sure she personally spoke to every patron in the place in the hour that I ate there.   But I digress... Onward to the food!!! My mother and I ordered the rainbow wrap and the sizzling sesame salad.   The sizzling sesame salad was composed of a sesame tofu, chili spiced almonds and an orange dressing. They rely on flavors versus sauces in this dish and I found it rather refreshing. The hit of spicy and sweet is one of my favorite combinations so this one was really a win.   The rainbow wrap was full of fresh crisp veggies and I had the hummus of the day as a side. ( It was a spicy red pepper hummus if I remember correctly.) The texture was gorgeously fresh  and paired wonderfully with the crispy crunchy carrots, cucumbers, and red bell peppers. The wrap had a cashew \"cheeze\". Which is usually a soaked cashew pureed with different seasonings. It all danced and sung together in my mouth. Yes, I am willing to speak in metaphores because I loved it all so much.   I cook fairly similar to this at home so it's nice to find a place away from home that can treat food properly without relying on fats and butters and actually tastes good with out being 'bland' healthy.",

We have been vegan for 3 years and it's often hard to find good vegan food at restaurants- luckily we live in Southern California so it's not much of an issue here, and luckily Pomegranate didn't disappoint! I got the blueberry streusel french toast which was delicious, but tiny portion! Hubby got the nachos which were really flavourful, and he enjoyed them a lot. He got the turmeric latte- you can definitely tell that it's fresh turmeric, not powdered. Definitely an acquired taste but since we both enjoy turmeric at home, we loved it! I got the jnantik mocha which was amazing. I'm still dreaming about it now, and can't wait to come back to Phoenix to have another one!  We loved the food so much we even got some to go- the seaweed salad and a raw collard wrap. Both were good! I would definitely get the salad again, it was so different to anything I've ever had before.  The only cons are that the food is expensive (maybe foolish of me but I expected prices to be a bit less in Arizona compared to LA since rent, cost of living etc are cheaper), and the portion sizes were kind of small (maybe just what we ordered). But I do understand that the food is organic, non-gmo, etc, which I really appreciate!   Can't wait to come back!",

On every occasion that I've been here the customer service is beyond terrible. It's generally the same staff working, including the owners, and every time they've been rude, unpleasant, and unhelpful to a point where I feel extremely uncomfortable. The reason I've tried giving this restaurant more than one chance to redeem itself is because of the quality of the meals and ingredients that are used on the menu. The problem? It's overpriced. I understand they're using great ingredients, but I do all of my grocery and dining at places that have the same exact high quality standards that don't cost nearly as much as Pomegranate does. Some of the items I have bought were decent but I've had a few meals from them that made me sick immediately after. I love the idea behind Pomegranate so I hope that over time they can improve their menu, prices, and customer service skills.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like Pomegranate Cafe-- there are so few family-owned and family-run restaurants in Ahwatukee, and I can't even think of another exclusively vegetarian/vegan restaurant in the area. However, I'm not going to sugarcoat this at all: the atmosphere and the service are severely lacking, and the food is overpriced. For starters, there are not nearly enough tables, and for some reason, whoever designed the place chose to use a bunch of six seater tables instead of the standard four, so you end up with two or three people at a giant table and a waste of space. The space feels small, cramped, and stressful, especially during lunchtime hours. Furthermore, I was standing in a HUGE line of people waiting to order my lunch, and instead of helping expedite the process, one of the owners was standing around chatting it up with a group of women. I then got to wait 30 or 35 minutes for my food. The food was okay, but I have definitely had better-- I had a Philly Melt, and it was $10.50 or something like that. It wasn't worth the price or the wait. If you want good vegetarian/vegan food and don't want to spend this much or deal with the cramped atmosphere, go to Green. If you don't mind spending this much and want a way better atmosphere, go to True Food. I don't think I will be visiting Pomegranate Cafe again.",

Noticed the menu only had 4 options for breakfast, and as I am a picky eater, only 1 appealed to me.  Guess the menu changes every week depending on what is fresh.  I ordered pankcakes, my fiance ordered breakfast tacos, we both got cappuccinos.  Sat at a rickety table next to dirty veggies in a loud deli case, and drank our espresso drinks, noticing they were HORRIBLE.  Tasted burnt.  Then the food was ready.  OOPS.  Only the tacos were ready, and I had to wait ofr pankcakes.  after a few minutes, I got my pancakes.  My fiance said his tacos were only ok, nothing special.  The pancakes were served with thawed frozen blueberries, odd for such a \"fresh\" oriented place, as well as COLD syrup.  No butter or even the OPTION of asking for butter.  They tasted like cardboard, no flavor at all.  Terrible.  After choking down 1 pancake, finishing my burnt cappuccino, we bussed our own table, not a problem, except the garbage was overflowing, and no one helped us.  We balanced our trash on the pile, and left.  We will not go back.",

The homemade veggie chips were tasty too!  I will look forward to returning there again soon!  Thank you, Pomegranate cafe!",

    "text": "Today was my third visit to Pomegranite Cafe. Good to see it's grown favorably in the last year and a half with unique organic foods. The staff is friendly but unfortunately there is an issue I'd like to address.  I have a lung issue with cleaning sprays. After each customer leaves their table a staff member quickly comes to spray the table down for the next customer. The tables are very close together. When I asked the staff if there was an order to the spray I was told \"absolutely not.\" Naively, I believed her. The spray burned my lungs and I immediately left my table to move about twenty feet away. Lungs still burning I returned to my friends at the table about ten minutes later. During the meal I found it hard to enjoy conversation with my friends for fear the staff would sneak in a spray. When a second staff member came toward the neighboring table my friend spoke up for me and said, \"No spray.\" The staff member (male) respected that and did not use spray. A few minutes later the first staff member came to a table out of my  view and quickly sprayed at which time my friend said, \"No spray, please\" but it was too late. I immediately left the restaurant. This lung issue was just diagnosed this year. No one wants to be \"one of those people\" but unfortunately now, I am. Staff members should be respectful of the customer. I was not respected by the first staff member who sprayed twice at my request twice not to spray. Say what you will, but burning lungs do not make for a restful or healthful lunch, despite the menu.",

I got the Athena salad which was under $10 for the small. I was surprised by how much came in it. I couldn't even finish it because I was full.  We also got a side of the avocado toast with herb bread. It was probably my favorite of all. The bread had so much flavor. We sat outside and had such a nice server. Everything came out within 20  minutes or so, and it was a Sunday. I loved everything about this place, from the cucumber water, to the amazing sweets they had inside. I had the cookie dough truffle covered in chocolate, it was so good! I loved this place, and everything was vegan!! Amazing!",

I spoke to a few of the servers, Mandy being one of them--and eventually a manager named Stormy - they all were adept in ingredient and nutrition knowledge. The team worked symbiotically! Very Friendly..  The food was more then plentiful. My mind danced around the menu... I felt like what a squirrel looks like! All Manic and excited.. my heart was pounding with delight of the scents, the flavors, the textures-the ambience, the ingredients! I felt like the rat In ratatouille when he bit into the smoked cheese, mushroom etc. sparks were flying..   My spirt felt cleansed during our visit and afterwards and as I typed this now, I'm ready to return!  Thank you Pomegranate Cafe and it's owners It's team members  And congratulations on expanding- they are opening a new location! So thankful that it is privately owned. I see why people travel from far away distances just to experience this splendid healthy well flavored food!  Eat here, rather treat yourself , experience this TODAY!",

We hadn't been in a while so didn't know a) they take reservations and b) they had expanded.   We knew being Mother's Day it would likely be very busy. As expected we walked into a very crowded restaurant. The hostess let us know it would be about 45 mins so we decided to grab a few drinks at the counter. We ordered three different coffee drinks (I forget what they were called but they were very good). Within 10 min of being there they had a table outside for us. We were pleasantly surprised!  They had a specific menu for Mother's Day so we split the mesquite pancakes (huge portions but honestly wasn't my favorite), tacos and burrito (both of those were delicious). Portions are always way bigger than we remember (definitely could have just ordered two meals for the three of us). And desserts are always on point (we typically get something chocolate to take home). We love that most everything is healthy, vegan, organic and gluten-free. We just wish they would open another location in north Phoenix!",

Even the hardcore carnivores come here and don't miss the meat ;) I have been going to the Chandler location any chance I get and the vibe and atmosphere is infectious with good vibes! Cassie, the owner is such a delight! She is always open to listening to any tips or menu items that were a special that you want on the menu permanent. I HIGHLY recommend the blueberry lavender smoothie! It has a hint of house made lavender syrup and it always a good one on a hot Arizona day! The Green Bandido bowl is also amazing! Their weekend brunch specials are delicious! The green juices have no ice so you're getting your monies worth!   If you plan on heading there on a weekend be prepared for it to be busy! If you're in a rush on the weekend this is not a place to go. Good quality food takes time and it requires some patience as the hard working staff do their best to get the food to you fresh! Come in enjoy the company you keep and fill up on healthy eats! You definitely won't leave being hungry and there is something on the menu for everyone's taste buds! They can also accommodate food allergies for almost anything! Love love love the Pom!",

On a schedule today...so after training, I stopped in to get a vegan apple cranberry muffin, vegan/lavender cupcake and a lemonade.   Let me back up a taste....  This hidden gem is nestled somewhere in the foothills...but easy to find. Great atmosphere. Excellent staff...and the mother and daughter team was not just a dream of there's to provide this eatery- but a blessing, for those that are trying to be mindful of what we fill our bodies and souls with. Outdoor dining is available and great interior decor to boot.   The goodies that I found were absolutely marvelous on point. Straight up delicious. And the lemonade. Wow. Just wow. Local ingredients. Community oriented. Good vibes. Healthy and tasty. Not a surprise that when people ask me what I eat- I say Pom Cafe!   Great job as usual.   Breakfast next time....",

I had the tacos vivos served on a red cabbage leaf which was very tasty and tasted just like tacos. The side salad was awesome as well. See photo of the taco vivo. My wife had the AZ roll, if you like sushi you will love the AZ roll with the texture and taste of Sushi. Also had the lemon bars afterwards, wow taste like the real deal.

We came in after hour long hike on South Mountain with rumbling tummies for some good food! We were greeted and sat immediately with menus and cucumber waters. I was in awe of the trendy decor with mason jar as light fixtures and community style seating.   Reviewing the menu, you understand Pomegranate Cafe has a passion for bring locally sourced foods with bust of flavor in Vegetarian style. I was amazed all the different selections of salads, wraps, sharables, burritos/bowls and drinks to chose from. I chose the nachos and my friend chose a burrito. My nachos came with \"meat\" plant based meat that brought it whole another level. It tasted really good. My friend enjoyed her burrito as well. She mentions that we should come back for breakfast as they have good menu. I took note of the brunch hours for weekend, 8-4pm with special items as noted on wall.   Pomegranate Cafe does also have market attached for locally sourced items if you need to grab anything before leaving. You have come experience this gem.",

    "text": "For a veggie lover, it is really hard to go wrong with Pom. They have the most extensive veggie/gluten-free menu I've ever seen in the Phx Metropolitan area. {The menu is literally a booklet}.  It's also not just a winner because of the food. Their lattes and smoothies are the zenith of local nutritional fancy beverage (holla @ the coconut caramel latte & hibiscus cooler). You are definitely paying a steep price for some of the options here, but hey, if theyre made with the sweet nector of forbidden fire fruit and blended cashew milk, maybe theyre worth the $10? Definitely just get them because they're served in a Mason jar. Even your cucumber water here is served in a Mason jar. This place is kitschy and rustic and very instagram friendly. For the best shot, make sure you get the cactus centerpiece in {see my examples below}.   Also, a short word on their desserts: they all look nice. They don't all taste nice. Such is the reality of sugar alternatives.   OH and before I completely forgot, their happy hour is dope. Definite go between 4 and 6 for the best value on already good food. {Pom, your Nachos and Wraps are Killing IT}.",

The service was great everyone was so friendly, the food was really good, and they're pet friendly. The interior is pretty big a lot of tables to sit at. They also do to go orders for drinks as well! I got the raw tacos vivos and the elephant curry bowl with a greena colada! I definitely recommend trying those out for the first time! All of their food is vegan but you can add eggs if you like.  This place is kind of pricey just for those three things I did pay $40 plus tip. But other than that I do recommend trying this place out!",

The Mermaid salad was a huge combo of dark greens/seaweeds/tofu - I recommend it for a guilt free dinner. Friends had GF mac and cheese and a huge burrito. All seemed to enjoy. Desserts were mostly raw and 'ehh'. I wouldn't spend the money on the desserts (because when did a healthy dessert really taste great?) There is wine, beer, cider. The specialty cocktails were a bit on the pricey side so I can't say if they were worth the $13 bucks.There is also a happy hour menu but we did not order from it.",

I am super lucky as I own a building down the street that I have to manage on a regular basis.  I always am stopping by here to get breakfast, lunch, a drink in between meals.  I've had a lot on the menu but some of the highlights are the tamale pie, the raw tacos are delish, the kale and cobb salads are great.  The drink menu is also plentiful, some of my favorites are the green abundance drink and the green coffee drink with berries.  The breakfast burritos are also filling and really fresh.  The prices are more expensive than other places but when you look at the quality of the food and care that goes into making their dishes it's totally worth it.  The only thing I would knock them on ( and I won't because the food is 6 stars) is the time it takes to get your order.  I've also been given other people's orders by mistake.  They are always nice about it but as they have become more popular over the years they seem to have a hard time keeping up.  Oh and lastly the deserts are really good and reasonably priced considering they are raw and generous portions.  I take them to go and they go a long way to satisfy a sweet tooth cravings you may have.  In my case I don't normally have deserts but I don't miss having one here.  They are fantastic.  I am super happy to support this place and hope they keep doing well as there is no substitute out there.",

    "text": "Furious and starving are the last two things you want to leave a restaurant. In the past, when the Pom screwed up an order of mine, they apologized and gave me a gift certificate (anywhere from $2-10). This I found odd, because other places I go, if the waiter or cook forgets and puts the allergen(s) in my food, I usually get a meal comped. I thought that was the industry standard. I am not saying I expect this, but I found it odd, as the first time it happened, the $2 didn't even cover the tax on the meal. Honestly, all I *really* want is my food, free of things that would cause me a trip to the hospital.  I am a regular customer; I come in there at least once a month with a group of friends. Being that I have a lot of food restrictions, I usually order the same delectable item. However, I was told to have them make it from scratch (the rainbow wrap) because they pre-make them every morning, and in the past, when I ordered it without my allergens - raw tomatoes and onions - they've forgotten, or didn't pick out all of them, and once had to remake it *twice* because the cook was totally on autopilot.  One would think that at a place like this, food allergies would be understood and accommodated without question. However, the other day I arrived with my group, and when I attempted to order, was told, sorry, we're too busy to accommodate you. So it was a question of either order something else (which I either couldn't have or didn't want) or take my life into my hands. That is just not a fair option.   As it was, I was so hungry I couldn't wait an hour or two for the line to decrease, so I left. I thought about picking up something at TJ's and bringing it back there to dine with my friends, but why? Clearly they don't want my business, so why patronize a restaurant that doesn't want to sell me food?",

Once I got the avocado sandwich and the eggs were pretty oily (I'm hoping it wasn't better). Today, I got the naked burger with the green goddess patty which is yummy but slightly undercooked the potato wedges.  Price- a bit high for the portions (smoothies) and sizes sometimes, however the naked burger plate came with a lot!  I'll still come back but sometimes the food quality varies. Great for vegetarians, vegans or/and anyone interested in trying delicious whole food meals!",

Another five min later and almost all our food made it out. We water finished eating and said just box up the food we are still waiting on. Not sure if it was the kitchen or the server Summer but wow. That sucked. The food was still delicious but I'm writing this negative review in hopes that some things can change because the service was just ridiculous. Half the tables were empty so they can't even blame being slammed. It was bad.",

It takes a long time to even get water and I have seen servers sitting by the computers playing on their phones while I wait to get the check. Food wise, I've had some really great things and some really bad things here. My friend got their \"sushi\" roll, which was surprisingly delicious. I also enjoyed their raw everything bagel, rocky road bar, and raw brownie. Some of the other desserts, however, were inedible. The chocolate peanut butter cupcake was so dry, I couldn't get a piece to stay on the fork. My husband had a blueberry \"cheese\"cake that had an off putting color and flavor. Neither of us took more than one bite. I do love their POM house milk, however. It went very well with their local coffee. I also would like to see them drop eggs and cheese off their menu. They really brand themselves as being vegan, I wish they would take the leap and get cruelty off their menu when they are already so close!",

They have a vast menu with a variety of options and even have a separate seasonal menu, plus weekend specials. Since moving to Arizona I have eaten here at least 25+ and have yet to be disappointed.   They use fresh and local ingredient that are always flavored/cooked to perfection. You'll want to save room for dessert (be careful the meals are filling) because their pastry display case is to die for. And on top of all their amazing food, the staff is always super friendly.    They have the 3 best qualities any top restaurant needs, great food, great service, and a great atmosphere. I would 10/10 recommend this for anyone whether you're vegish or not. All of my non-vegan friends that I've taken here were in shock that it tasted so good and filled them up!! Take a look at their colorful instagram and you'll see why I rave about this place.  I have never written a yelp review nearly this long before but I don't think I'll ever find one thing wrong with Pomegranate. If I could afford to eat here everyday, I 100% would.",

The commute was 50 minutes from downtown Phoenix to the Chandler Blvd. location and well worth it.   Ordered a ginger peach tea. After the heat of the drive, it was cold and flavorful. Then on to a chimichanga burrito packed with nourushment and the flavors of vegan chicken, avocado, potato, and tofu. They had a delicious vegan potato salad which was consumed with happiness. Fresh and excellent.   A friend dining with me ordered a Grilled Cheese Napoleon - which is a three layer sandwich on ancient grain bread with melted cheese, macadamia basil pesto, tomato & sauteed farm veggies. Looked great and he said it was delicious.  Satiated and benevolently comfortable, I slowly drained down a wonderful Coconut Caramel Latte - which is popular at Pomegranate. It is espresso, almond coconut milk, and house caramel syrup. So smooth and delicious.   Finally purchased a Dragon Bowl to go so I could eat it tomorrow. The Dragon Bowl contains farm vegetables & broccoli stir fry with sweet chile tamari sauce over quinoa.  If you appreciate professionally prepared quality in the form of vegan fare, coffees or smoothies, then Pomegranate Cafe will not disappoint. Good service, ambiance, and a cafe atmosphere with a background of music. I'll see you there sometime!",

The servers know their menu and have been wonderful making recommendations.  What a great place to come and enjoy wholesome and clean foods.   The best part is Dessert! They have gluten free, dairy free choices to satisfy your sweet tooth.",

    "text": "I have been to Pomegranate Cafe twice now and I was underwhelmed with both visits. The first visit was over a year ago and I don't think that review is necessarily relevant now so I will only review today.   We arrived and waited for a few minutes to be acknowledged by a staff member but we were eventually sat at a small table by the window and patio door. Not ideal or very comfortable. After we sat we waited again for a server to take our order. It looked like there was only 1 or 2 servers there.   We ordered mimosas and they took over 15 minutes to get to our table. Our server kept saying they were coming but that is a very long time to wait for a drink. Our food came out just a few minutes after the drinks which didn't give us any time to enjoy our drinks.   My friend and I both ordered the crispy \"chicken\" chimichurri burrito and I found it to be a very odd dish. The tofu was nowhere near crispy and was actually very squishy and off putting. There were so many beans and rice and everything just started to taste the same and was mushy. It also was very poorly wrapped so it fell apart everywhere.   Food and drinks are very expensive and I don't understand why. I don't think I would return after two poor experiences with food and service. They seem busy and to be doing well, so good for them! I am always happy to see a local business thrive, this place is just not for me.",

They are pretty expensive- so this prob isn't a place you go to everyday...but with that price does come a pretty great meal, all organic, farm to table, vegan/vegetarian (gluten free options too).  I ordered the Supreme Burrito ($15) and wow was it great. It comes with this extremely tasty Baja sauce on the side and chips and salsa. I do like their food so this is a nice periodic splurge place I can get good vegan food in my neighborhood. Side note* if you want to try bites of their food they look to have a fun \"happy hour\" Tues thru Thur 3-6 where you can get smaller portions for great prices and a beer, margaritas, wine!   Eat Local!",

Made with Almond Milk and a Human made Honey . Yes, very unique. We all 3 got one. The menu  looks very good and very healthy. There's even a little Market shop on the other side of the Bar. Then there's a nice sitting area outside.Although sitting outside when it's 116 is a no go. Will try that when it's cooler. Staff was friendly,and restrooms were clean.  Lots of parking and you'll find it in the same shopping center as Trader Joe's .",

They are 100% meat free but they are definitely a great place even for meat lovers. I'm not a vegetarian, I eat meat often but this is one of my favorite places to go when I'm in town.  They have a great rotating menu that they put it on a huge chalkboard inside and a regular set menu so your favorites will always be there.  I've had their wild western tacos with real eggs (you can sub out the real eggs and keep it vegan), banana bread pancakes (seasonal item), French toast, and I always get a hot chocolate with Pom milk. (It's a nut based milk). They have a super foods hot chocolate (it's a bit spicy so it's not for me but my husband loves it!) and I always get the kids one.   The only issue this place has is it's service. The staff are not well organized, call aheads  for tables get lost, so even though they say they will hold a table, don't be surprised to show up and no one has any idea what you are taking about and no table is waiting for you. The food can take a long time, and they also mess up orders a bit more often then I would like, but they are always quick to fix it and everyone is usually very friendly.",

This was my first visit and I kind of liked it, however my husband had been there a few times before and his visit this time wasn't as good since he ordered his usual Napoleon Grilled Sandwich which he said was very dry and did not have enough cheese for a grilled cheese (I totally agree). I had the SpinArt Quesadilla which was okay - did not have enough stuffing since the ends were almost dry. The hummus platter was great! And also the pomegranate chocolate cake was really good. Would probably return when in mood for vegan but wouldn't order the sandwich & the quesadilla. Also- I think the food is pricey for what you get.",

To me, it is just ok, however, they make an honest effort and my girlfriend loves this place, so they get 3 stars from me.  I don't want to imply it's a bad place, it is just so average and underwhelming -- from that perspective, 3 stars is appropriate.   Multiple times we have been and they have inexplicably run out of popular dishes.  The waitstaff is extremely polite but most of the time seems very harried which leads to awkward vibes during the meal, they are always running a bit behind, but they get the orders correct and are mostly attentive.    The menu itself is diverse, enough so that even a non vegan diner will find something tasty and good.  The restaurant is well decorated and there is always a crowd, I wouldn't try to go here if I were in a hurry.   The cold coffee is decent, while the hot coffee is just okay.    I'll probably go back here again and again, but each time, for me, it's just okay.  I'm sure you'll have a good experience and don't want to scare you away, however, unless you're vegan, I wouldn't prepare to be impressed.",

Sunday brunch seems to be a popular time here.  I got their seasonal pumpkin caramel latte made with house made POM mylk and oh my.. I can't stop thinking about it! I asked for half the caramel then usual and it was perfect, not too sweet, not too spicy, just perfect. Definitely got a pumpkin flavor but not overwhelming and the espresso was great. I grabbed a sweet potato pecan muffin for myself and a banana walnut for my hubby. My muffin was so moist, huge portion and chunks of pecans on top. The banana walnut was also huge and delicious. The pastry case was fully stocked with treats so I had a hard time deciding what to get!   I definitely want to come back and get brunch someday, I'm also hoping a more centrally located location will open up soon!!   The employee at the pastry counter helping me out was very pleasant, took time to answer my questions even though they were busy. I had a great experience.",

They were way too big for tacos and fell apart due to the wet ingredients. I had to eat them with a fork. My husband's biscuits and gravy didn't have enough gravy, they didn't split the biscuits, and the biscuits just weren't very good. Maybe I'm biased since I'm from Kentucky. The worst part was the service. It was busy but not too busy to be seated immediately. The server took our order quickly, and the food came within a reasonable amount of time. However, our waters were not refilled one single time and we were left to eat our meals with no beverage. Additionally, after finishing, we waited a small eternity to get our check, and only received it after flagging down the server, despite every attempt to convey visually that we were done. I don't think we will be back. Too expensive for what we experienced.",

    "text": "One of my favorite dishes as a meat eater was Shepherds pie,  so since I no longer eat meat I decided to try it vegan style.  All I can say is that it was warm, satisfying and delicious.  I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of flavor.  As far as the cost at Pomegranate's it is pricey but on the other hand you can feed two people with most dishes they serve there.  That includes their wonderful bakery items.  I have eaten there on 3 occasions and each time I have been more than happy with the food.  My only complaint is that it does seem to take a while to get your food which is okay due to the quality, but if you ask for something else, extra during your meal it seems like you may never get it.  Then suddenly when you have about given up here it comes.  The staff there could not be nicer but they seem somewhat spread thin.  Oh and I want to mention almost everything in their desert case is gluten free and the gluten free bread there is delish.",

    "text": "**Bumping this down a notch from 5 to 4 stars. Something has happened to this place over the last 2 years. It used to be a 'order your food and pay at the counter and we'll bring it over to you' experience. Now they try to herd you to a table when you walk in the door, so that you can wait for someone to bring you a glass of water that you used to just get yourself and then wait for ages for someone to take your order. And then wait for ages for the bill to be brought over so you can pay. We stopped frequenting this place simply because of this new way of serving people. We typically liked to come here during lunchtime or before heading somewhere else so can't afford to wait for very slow service. On a positive note though, the food still rocks.   ----  I have been a customer since moving to Phoenix several years ago. This place is great for vegetarians, but good for omnivores too. Meat eaters tell me the Lumberjack is awesome. I'm vegetarian, and this place is a unique find for veggie food in a very meat centric city.    You can make anything vegan, just by opting out of egg and milk products. Both are equally good.   I have enjoyed the freshness and tastiness of everything I have ever ordered here.  I usually have juice and one of their bowls with yummy pesto.  The place is usually pretty busy during prime mealtimes, so expect to wait a few minutes. It's also pricey. It isn't unusual to have a bill total $40 for two people.  That is the price you pay for fresh, healthy and organic goodness.  I have never had an issue with customer service, nor have they screwed up my order. The fresh juices and smoothies run around $8 or so and if I remember right the meals are $10-$12, give or take a couple bucks.  I have only had a few of their baked goods, but they always look tempting. Gluten-free options are available too.",

Perfect for that pre-grocery shopping (at Trader Joe's, next door) meal so that you don't go starving and buy WAY too much food.  As the slogan states, and everyone else has mentioned, Pom Cafe is \"indulgently healthy.\"  Fresh, organic, vegan, even raw food options.  Breakfast and lunch, juices, teas, elixirs, espresso, and baked goods.  Walking in, the atmosphere is calm and relaxed.  Walk up to the counter, check out the chalkboard for the specials and browse a paper menu for the rest.  Place your order at the counter and try not to be tempted by all of the delicious looking desserts calling your name.  Sit down at a table and they'll bring you your food.  If you feel like helping out and clearing your table, great!  There is a busing station on the back wall.  Or leave your dishes there and they will clear it for you.  The staff is friendly and energetic; you can tell they enjoy working there and giving you fresh healthy food and drinks.  I have tried a few different menu items and it addition to enjoying good tasting, healthy, vegan food, the portion sizes are quite generous and very reasonably priced.  I have left very satisfied stomach (meaning, I'm full) but not that heavy \"oh-no-what-did-I-just-eat\" feeling in my belly and my conscience.  Feel good and taste good healthful food!",

    "text": "I went to Pomegranate Cafe today and it was a total disappointment.  I show up and the place is arranged as an \"order yourself\" restaurant, which is perfectly fine.  The first thing you see when you walk in is a big counter, and no directions (or menus on the board, etc).  I walk up to the counter looking to order something, or learn how the process works, and the gentleman behind the counter asks if I'm dining in.  Kind of caught me by surprise because I'm thinking why is that the very first question, I just want to order food.  Let me stop and say that already, while he's polite, he's definitely making me feel like I'm doing something stupid and I should already know how the process works.  He tells me to take a seat anywhere, I look around and there are no seats available, he realizes it and he says there's plenty of seating outside.  That's good with me, I like sitting outside even in az, and he says he'll take water to me.  Ok so far not too bad even though the process is awkward and I still haven't seen anything resembling a menu.  But here's where it gets really bad.  I go ahead and take my seat outside and just wait, and wait, and wait.  No water, no menu, no greeting from any waiter, NOTHING.  Of course now I'm disappointed; I followed the directions from the guy at the counter and proceed to be completely ignored.  I felt like leaving at this point (who wants to be ignored?), but I was craving their type of food and had gone out of my way to go there today, so I thought I'd give it another try.  I walk back in to the place and speak with another nice young gentleman who after learning what had taken place proceeded to only say \"oh when we're not busy we like doing table service so we'll follow you with a menu, but I think when you sat down we got busy in a rush.\"  That makes no sense at all of course, I was perfectly willing to order at the counter but they were the ones who asked me to grab a table/seat.  Then he did nothing except give me this card that has a link to their website and a couple of marketing tag lines.  Did not say sorry, let me take care of you now, or anything.  I stood there not knowing what to do so I just said thank you and walked out.  Extremely disappointed, because I was looking forward to trying this place after I heard good things about it.  This really should be a one star review, but I'm leaving two stars for two reasons: one because I didn't actually get to try their food (unfortunately), and two because if I leave a one star this review may not be taken seriously, and I do feel If nothing else that their management should fix this.  I understand they may cater to a lot of regulars and a certain type of clientele, but I'm sure they would welcome new clients as well.  Today they did not, despite repeated opportunities.",

I also had a 'milk'shake that had caramel and jnantik (a mayan superfood that tastes like coffee) topped with cocowhip and that was a massive treat. (In LA we pride ourselves on being on the cutting edge and I don't know of anyplace here currently offering jnantik.) I took home a bunch of sweets and my favorite was the chocolate cake, though they were all great and I'm confident you cannot go wrong. I've been craving their fare since and look forward to the next time I visit my cousin in Tempe so I can come again. Can you ladies publish a cookbook please? Thanks in advance.",

Drinks: 1) Braveheart (leafy greens, kale, cucumber, celery, apple, orange) 2) Some kind of berry smoothie? Both were refreshing and good.

It was a little grainier and had a more cumin taste but it tasted fresh. 4) Raw Berries & Cream Parfait (Raspberry cream, seasonal fruit, berries, nuts & seeds): one of my favorite parts of the meal.

    "text": "If I could give this place 6 stars, I would!  Tasty? Indulgent? Doesn't-taste-like-it's-vegi/vegan? Check, Check, Check!!  Honestly I have probably never been more emphatic about a restaurant.  This quaint little shop (although it has been expanded) has a wonderful vibe, and you are able to see just how fresh their food is. Their chalkboard of daily specials welcomes you and their glass-door refrigerators remind you that you are eating fresh, whole, and unaltered vegetables and fruits.  The cashier is knowledgeable, friendly, and greeted with a smiling face.  I ordered the Strawberry Rhubarb French Toast and a cup of the daily soup: Curried Sweet Potato. (I'm a sucker for anything sweet potato.)  I sat down with my number and waited for my food. Both dishes arrived shortly, and my mouth watered at their sight.  The french toast (banana bread with the rhubarb jam and whipped cream) was likely the best french toast I've ever had. I used to have a favorite place for french toast, but this plate left it in the dust. The banana bread was moist, thick, and came with delicious fresh strawberries. Not too sweet, and the light rhubarb jam complemented the thick banana bread to a tee. Unlike other new and healthy restaurants, the portions were not tiny and unfilling. On the contrary, I would think most people would split the order of french toast. I just wish I had come on a day with a special french toast on the menu!  The sweet potato soup was sweet, creamy, and the curry flavors accented it wonderfully.  To finish things off, I couldn't leave without trying one of their tempting cakes! I spoke with one of the owners for a while (who is wonderful), and based on her recommendation I tried the mango and blackberry raw cheesecake. Not only did this cheesecake not taste like it had no dairy, but it likely tops other cheesecakes I have tried.  I can only hope this place stays in business for years to come. When it comes to nutrition, it is vital for restaurants to be completely aware of what they are serving, for them to strive to bring patrons healthy meals, and have fun doing it! Pomegranate Cafe does not fall short; I will be back soon!",

As a vegan, it is hard to find restaurants to eat at, and even harder to find ones that are packed full of whole food ingredients and made on-site. An example of their exceptional customer service was on this past Mother's Day, when we did not have a reservation (and the restaurant was packed), but the workers made a point to help us find a place to sit anyways and were very accomodating to my mother's food allergies.   My last visit, I shared an amazing slice of chocolate cake (very rich and surprisingly like the non-vegan variety), two delicious juices, the raw tacos, and a loaded baked potato quesadilla. Both entrees came with an amazing kale salad. In the past, I have had brunch and dinner.   If you are looking for a healthy, satisfying (you won't leave hungry) and appropriately priced (when you consider the value you get) meal, come to Pomegranate!",

Pomegranate has to be one of my favorites.  I am on a strict diet of no sugar, gluten, dairy, grains, beans, etc. so mainly a vegan diet (doctor ordered) so finding this gem was a god sent.  My first time at the cafe I had an Athena Wrap which was actually suppose to be a bowl since I cant have grains but that was my fault because you are given options of either a grain wrap, collard leaf wrap or in a bowl  I forgot to order the bowl, it still was really good.  The lemon bar made with xylitol was a good no sugar dessert option and surprisingly sweet tasting.   Second time in,  I order the POM \"nut cheese\" plate and the Raw Everything Bagel (the bagel being made from nuts and vegies).  There was so much food I could not eat it all and I really tried.  The POM cheese plate offer three different types of cheeses all made from nuts.  There was a cheddar rolled in walnuts, herb and spreadable almond cheese that didn't have a name but was delish.  It was served with various fresh vegetables, flax seed crackers and strawberries.  The Raw Everything Bagel sandwich was a nut and vegie made bagel with loads grated carrots, cabbage, sunflower sprouts and a almond ranch dressing spread. It was tasty but my only complaint and it is a common complaint of many restaurants is that stack the fillings so high that it is impossible to actually take a bite of your sandwich without everything falling out all over the place.  I ended up just pulling it apart and eating with a knife and fork to cut down on the mess.  I walk out with my doggie bags and a very satisfied belly and no guilt.",

    "text": "This place is amazing!! I'm so glad that I work close to a place that serves such delicious veg/vegan food. I have to say, it's pricey for what it is, but if you want to eat well, it's worth it. I had the Kale salad with an organic Arnold Palmer (it's not on the menu--I asked them to mix it for me). Both were delicious. It's one of those places where you pay, get a number, and pick a table where they come bring your food. The staff is very friendly and attentive. They came by a few times to see if I needed anything, and even offered me free refills. I'd come back here any day to try more items on their menu, but I'd probably have to limit it to about once a week. My lunch came out to $18 the last time I was there (not quite sure how though).   Overall, give this great place a shot if you don't mind your wallet taking a little bit of a hit. The veg/vegan options are among the best I've ever had.",

    "text": "Went here for the first time and really expected more from this place. I had been wanting to try it for a year or so and convinced my guy friend to go in with me. When we came in it wasn't too crowded. We only had to wait a couple minutes for a table which was great, but after we got seated the service was horrible. We got in around 7:30 our waitress greeted us, got us our drinks and food. After that we didn't see her for forever. Everything was so hectic. We had different servers refilling our water checking in on us, everyone seemed to be doing 5 different jobs on top of their own main job which is completely unnecessary (one server to one table doing one job is what should have been happening). When our food came I wasn't too impressed, I got the macaroni pesto dish. The veggies were great but the pasta just lacked flavor. After we finished our food we waited about 15 for our waitress to come back to take our dessert order/ give us boxes. On top of that our desserts took so long to come out. I ordered the Brazilian Brownie which took another 10 minutes to get to me (which easily could have taken 2 minutes to be taken out from the front where the dessert counter is and placed on to a plate and given to me). My friend order a milkshake and that took almost 20 minutes for us to get! When it got to him he asked for it to go since we were already there so long. After waiting about 10 minutes to get the milkshake to go I had to go upfront to ask for it along with the check. My waitress was up there working the register and handed me the melted shake that had been sitting out for some time now. We got the milkshake and the check and got out as quickly as possible. It was literally 5 minutes till close when we left.  The food is extremely overly priced as well, if it was exceptionally well I would understand but it's mediocre. I know the food I all 100% organic, nonGMO, is really Eco- friendly and has quality ingredients, but the pricing is still way too expensive. With two plates and two desserts it would have came to $ 46.00 ( $52.00 with tip) but our waitress took off the milkshake given it was so melted.  The business NEEDS to work on organization. I would suggest having a set group of people working the register (pick up orders, desserts, & making stuff for the people who come into pick up smoothies, drinks ect.) so the servers don't have to do all this stuff as well. I've worked in the restaurant business before so I understand a place being busy and lacking a 5 star service but this place wasn't that busy. They had 3-4 servers covering maybe a total of 8-10 tables. Where I worked 1 server would take on 6 tables at a time and still give the best service you could get. The servers and workers could easily give great service but it's so unorganized and the servers don't seem motivated to get things done.  I won't be coming back anytime soon.",

Talk about mouthwatering delicious!  I desperately wish they had a location in austin Texas whet I live as, this place blows all the vegan options there out if the water by far. Or maybe if they had a cookbook!   The owner even gave us a pomegranate chocolate cake ball and another dessert when we were wit to leave just so we could try them. The pomegranate cake ball was one of the best desserts I've ever had (I'm including all non-vegan desserts in this comparison as well).  Get the kale salad too. It's amazing,  and the dressing they make in-house is sooo tasty!  I'm a little embarrassed to admit it,  but this place is so good,  I went back the next night before my flight flew out and got the same dinner to go. Yes,  It's that good.",

AND it's right next to Trader Joe's...win!  However, their hours keep changing, so I never know how late they will be open.  Also, it is very confusing as to whether you seat yourself and someone will take your order, or if you go order and then sit down.  Last time I was there, I saw people doing it both ways. I had ordered and then sat down, and the servers ignored me, but seemed to wait on everyone around me.  It's also expensive and usually crazy busy.  But I continue to come here for the coffee and raw/gluten-free treats, and fun health-foody finds like maca powder and mason jar glasses!",

With that being said, I absolutely love that most everything at Pomegranate Cafe is vegan & organic & bonus stars for the raw options. I went there the first time towards the end of October & I had some kind of a burrito. I ate the whole thing, it was delicious. I then ordered a caramel coconut drink from their coffee menu along with a desert. Everything was delicious. After I was finished m I went to the bathroom to wash my hands & I am not sure what happened but shortly after I came out, I got nauseated. I puked all my lunch which is way odd for me to so b/c I NEVER vomit/puke or anything. Not even when I  sick. Maybe I was so excited I ate too quick & too much? I don't know. Another weird thing that happened was, during our lunch, I asked to keep one of the menus b/c I wanted to continue browsing through (it was my first time there) I was told I couldn't b/c they were short of menus. LOL. Odd. Then a few minutes later she gave me back the menu. Alrighty. Ha!!  My B/F said that we should not come back b/c he was sure it was the food that made me sick but I refused to believe. We went back again a couple of weeks later & I had he raw tacos. They were good. We had a good experience. Except when I ordered my caramel coconut drink from the coffee menu, it didn't taste the same as last time. Like AT ALL. I ended up throwing it away. But, overall, a nice experience.  My 3rd visit just a couple of weeks ago, I ordered the French toast and was very disappointing. There was nothing French toast about this French toast. It was a pastry, like banana bread. Totally didn't even eat it. Had a few bites but that's it. I did order the organic scramble & it was super delicious.  4 stars for now.",

I adore the atmosphere as well! They've expanded a lot and now include an area where you can buy produce, grab and go items, and little trinkets. The fried tofu avacado breakfast sandwich is amazing, definitely try it! The staff is also incredibly friendly and knowledgeable! Pricing is also more expensive but you get what you pay for.",

    "text": "We are not vegans but transitioning to a more plant based diet. I thought the menu was extensive almost too many options but decided on the omelet special. Everything was very tasty for my meal, but my husbands buffalo \"chicken\" wrap was beyond spicy. Our toddlers' meals (Mac and dairy cheese and grilled dairy cheese) were terrible. The pasta was mush, needed salt and tasted strange even though it had real cheese. Her side of broccoli was supposed to be steamed, but was pretty much just as crunchy as crudite.   The service was just a hot mess. Our waitress was kind and friendly but it too over 40 min for our food to come out, with hungry toddlers...not fun!  It seemed as if there were tons of employees but not many doing anything productive. While changing my baby in the bathroom, we asked for soap since the dispenser was empty. No one ever came back with a refilled soap...so had to wash our hands with just water after a #2 diaper.   I'd go back and try something else and perhaps a dessert, but the service was just slloooww especially on a weekend.",

    "text": "Ugh. What a mess.   We went to this cafe Sat. night for a friend's 30th birthday. Let's run through the whole event. We arrive at 7 with a somewhat large-ish party (8 people) and they weren't too busy - well more than half the tables were empty. We went inside and one of the staff members helped move a couple tables together to seat everyone. 15 mins later, a waitress comes by with a tray of waters. She literally threw them at us. They were slammed down on the table with such forces that water spilled out the top. No apology, no offer to clean them up. Waitress looked like we personally had run over her dog, scowling and glaring at us. So, not off to a great start. Another 15 mins passes and she comes back to take our drink/appetizer orders, again gruff as can be. Ok. Maybe she's having a rough day? Whatever. Another 20 mins and she comes back to take our food orders. She brings out the drinks and appetizer about 10 mins later - mind you, it's been an hour now since we were seated. 45 mins later (no joke) she comes back to tell us that one of the ingredients for a dish one of our party ordered is unavailable. They ran out. Ok, whatever. That happens. But it took you 45 mins to realize this? Oh, yeah. And by this point, we still haven't received food, our waters have never been refilled, no one has checked up on us to make sure we're doing alright, and the bread that we ordered for our appetizer still hasn't arrived. Another 30 mins passes and finally our food arrives. It felt like they just dumped hot sauce all over everything instead of actually trying to make things taste good. One of our party members had to send her food back because it was simply too hot for her to eat. Again, no apologies, no recommendations for something else... she did offer to at least remove the food sent back from the check. So around the two hour mark, the last dish for our party arrives. Normally, I don't have the patience to sit around and wait for food this long but it was my friend's birthday, she picked this restaurant, and I'm going to be patient for her. But after two hours of waiting on terrible service, I was at my wit's end. A couple people order desserts to go. The desserts tasted pretty good so at least they have that going for them. But they brought them out on plates, not to go. It felt like we had to repeat everything for them a few times just so they could get the orders right. After another 20 mins, the waitress comes back out to finally check on us. We ask for the checks and try to figure out why our service was so terrible. Her excuse? \"Well, we're kind of busy\" - (by this point, we're one of three tables remaining) \"all of our food is cooked fresh\" - (half our plates were \"raw\" food, no cooking required and every other restaurant cooks their food fresh, too, and it doesn't take two hours to get it). Very lame, very unapologetic excuses. Every time we looked for our waitress, we saw her standing around talking to other staff members. So busy. She comes back out, 20 mins later, with the checks and offers to take 10% off because \"we were so patient with them tonight\". Whatever, it's a gesture. However, still no apology. Maybe she thought that since we were getting the discount an apology wasn't necessary? I couldn't tell you. The icing on the cake of all this? Our waitress was the restaurant's MANAGER. If Stormy (our waitress/manager) is working when you go, don't bother. You will wait around forever for your food and she'll treat you like you're the one that screwed up for coming to this establishment. Suffice to say, I will never be returning to this cafe. Over 2.5 hours just to get food and basic service? I could have gone to the grocery store, cooked all the food myself, made it better than them, not have to put up with absolutely dismal service... and it STILL would have been cheaper than going to this place. This location is poorly managed and there is just no excuse for that.",

    "text": "If you are vegan or a veg-curious, Pomegranate Cafe is the best hope you have to stick to your new-found diet.  The staff and owners are passionate, intelligent, and incredibly hardworking.    Look folks... in order to be able to make as much fresh food as this place does, it is going to cost a lot on overhead.  Just to carry all of the fresh veggies and fruits for smoothies and juice has to be a fridge jenga feat on it's own.  Most restaurant owners do not care enough about their regulars to make this a reality.  To be completely honest, Pom is undercharging on most of their pastries and juices which is why I am totally blown away by their customer service.  What's that?  You used to eat cheesecake while watching Oprah in the 80's but you can't do it anymore because your trainer said that those days are over?  Well, then you should eat the delicious RAW VEGAN CHEESECAKE at Pom (shhh... it's made of nuts and other goodies).  What's that?  You like to go to Whole Foods and pay 10 dollars for juice?  Pomegranate is faster, cheaper, and they use local ingredients when it is smart to do so.  Conscious capitalism indeed.  Oh, you like to eat in unique, vibrant settings?  This place has beautiful colored walls, an open view of the juice bar and clear fridges so you can dine and feel like you are part of the action.  While most places will hide what they do to YOUR food, Pom offers more transparency, so you can rest easy that your food is being prepared with great service and with fresh ingredients.  What is this green stuff?  Look, I have eaten a lot of the stuff here, but STRAIGHT UP, you have to try something that has the cilantro pesto.  This sauce will gussy up any Mexican food dish, a spark for the tip of your tongue, with a small lemon tang, and a nice fresh smooth and soothing swallow that blooms with spice and heat.  And this sauce is a beautiful baseball field green.  I didn't even know that this was a culinary possibility until I ate here.  I noticed that there are some reviews on here about bad service, but I was informed that the space was remodeled about a year ago.  Most of the one star and two star reviews were from before the remodel, which shows how much focus and attention the owners (a mother and daughter that currently work at Pom) and staff have really put into growing as an establishment.  Please, do yourself a flavor, and stop in for a juice or treat if you happen to be in the neighborhood.  You can either sit down and eat a full meal (appetizers, course, desert, coffee), or take a quick juice or pastry to go in minutes.  It can't be easy to offer so many types of service AND be all natural plant based.  KUDOS TO POM FOR SETTING THE BAR HIGHER.  Nom Nom Pom.",

I watched drinks sit at the window for well over 10 minutes. And food sat at the window for 5 minutes before the cook yelled at them to take it out.

My only complaint is that they are becoming so popular, that it is more and more difficult to find seating on the weekends.

    "text": "So on our visit to Arizona we wanted some vegan food since that is what we are.. vegan. Pomegranate cafe came up on our yelp search . Let start out by saying the food we had, had a laxative effect on my whole party. I had the grilled cheese Napoleon, thinking it would be hard to screw up a grilled cheese right? Wrong this place found a way and a way I had never thought of. It committed the most diabolical of culinary crimes,putting carrot in a grilled cheese!! Carrot? You have to be kidding me, who does this? They do. The bread was soggy and oily and fell apart when you picked it up ... on to the crab cakes Benedict. Two sloppy crab cakes with a heaping of a way too spicy sauce that just killed any flavor profiles the dish had. It was taken back immediately. It was unpalatable and could not be eaten. The biscuits and gravy was terrible. Two doughy biscuits with a flavorless gravy and some scrambled tofu and four bits of vegan sausage. The biscuits were too large and too soft to eat . The tofu was unremarkable and made no impact It was a overpriced fiasco that was very disappointing,the service was very very slow but the staff were very nice and accommodating. The availability of vegan food is bad enough in some areas and the pricing of some restaurants is just ridiculous and unnecessary. This is plant based dining and should not, ever be this expensive. Unpalatable vegan food and overpricing is the reason people poke fun at a vegans. A Plant based  diet is a way of life not a trend and shouldn't be charged as such",

Second, screwing up on simple beverage order, and  not informing me that the entree I ordered is not available, and substituting another entree 180 opposite to what I would order! What ever happened to addressing the customer by saying \" We ran out of your chosen entree, could we interest you in something else?\"  But no....  Third, the price for two to have entrees and 1 appetizer was $52.00. And trust me this place is shabby and lacks comfort and decent servers. My wife and I are frequent customers of The CuttingBoard in Mesa AZ. We were told Pomegranate was the same perhaps better. We think not! The CuttingBoard rocks and service is exceptional. Save your money and humility and stay far away from Pomegranates. They are lucky I gave them 1 star.",

My only other comment is they should have all nutrition info. for each of their dishes.  I specifically asked for the info, and after checking, the server told me they did not have this info. available.  That's frustrating when trying to watch my intake.

Menu: food menu and drink menu (healthy drinks) were plentiful! I had no idea what to choose for either of them. I finally decided to go for the supreme burrito and the blue lagoon smoothie.   Supreme burrito = grilled spinach tortilla stuffed with brown rice, kale, carrots, zucchini, other farm veggies, beans, cheese and guacamole and cashew sour cream. Smothered with enchilada sauce with a side of purple cabbage ginger slaw and a couple slices of oranges. Not sure if I could really taste that but sounded so unique! This can definitely fill a hungry man's stomach if he's not the type to eat healthy food. $14  Blue lagoon smoothie = blueberry. pineapple. Spirulina. Chia. Kale. Coconut h2o. Brain on (helps focus. de stress. Lifts mood). Topped with a couple frozen blueberries and a couple squares of pineapple. This was surprisingly  blue-licious!! $14 - yes $14 for a drink!! Better have had given me all those health benefits!  Baked goods = seasonal pomegranate cake and their thick chocolate chip with oats, walnuts and choc chip! $8 and $3 respectively.   All in all this place was quite delicious and healthy. Servers were nice. Waters were given in jars and to go cups. You can enjoy eating outside as well as inside. One part of my food had a possible hair but I think I will try to ignore that part..  Minus that tidbit of un-welcomed thing I will give it another shot. The desserts and drinks are begging me to come back.",

Such a happy, calming atmosphere and love that they move at a slower pace here so it really forces you to be present for a whole meal. It is busier on weekends for brunch but worth the wait. All their food is amazing and made with great ingredients. Coming here is like going to a wellness center, just doing something good for myself. Love their pancakes and breakfast sandwiches. Really filling and delicious. So far I've tried lemon blueberry pancakes and rocky road. The rocky road pancakes were so good but be ready to share because they are super rich, chocolatey, and basically dessert. I got tofu scramble so I could have a bite of something savory too. Besides their brunch menu I've also tried their desserts. When you walk in they have a case of raw cakes, muffins, cupcakes, and chocolate desserts. I usually don't like raw desserts much but everything they have is so good.",

Leaves water n walks off to chat with coworkers. After a good 5 Minutes n no acknowledgment from anyone we walked out. According to my daughter in law they also had bad service there in November and didn't care for the food. So I guess he saved us from this over priced restaurant.",

Both items were unlike anything else I've ever tried, which isn't something I can say very often. I loved the creative approach to each of the items. The fact that they were able to create such unique flavors while incorporating vegan, organic and non-gmo ingredients is even more impressive. My only complaint is the cost of the meal makes the restaurant more of a special occasion spot than a regular in my restaurant rotation. Mostly, I'm just bummed that I can't go every week to try something new without taking out a second mortgage. I guess it's True though ... you can't put a price on quality.

Prices might come off a tiny bit high but its super clean eating and I had so much food/bev that I couldn't finish.   It might be because I was eating a \"quick bite\" alone but service was nonexistent. I sat a long time waiting to order, to get my order, and to pay (no extra stops made by anyone... In fact the hostess saw my card out and closed my check). I was here for about an hour (not so quick) plus the \"5min\" wait that was more like 10-15. Again no big deal but something to keep in mind. Oh and its not that busy. There's a steady flow of people.   Overall I liked this place, could probably get my bf to try it, but I wish the service matched the ambience and the food.",

    "text": "I had really high hopes for this place. I am very into raw/vegan food and was excited to see that they served fresh food that suited my palate.   I went this week with my son and friend and the bill was close to $35. For a small serving of food I was really surprised at the price they charged. In fact, I had a juice a two sides in order not to spend $10 on kale.   The juice I had (kale, coconut water, berries, etc) was really good. The portion size was nice and I noticed that they had other really good veggie/fruit combos. I think that if you are into juice and have money to burn then this should be your go to place.   As I mentioned before, I chose to have sides to avoid their high plate prices. The pasta salad was pretty bad. The beet salad was also very bad. The beets were cooked, which I didn't expect and there was no dressing on the salad. It was just really bland and not at all what I expected.   My son had a quesadilla and it was really small. They gave him a few carrots and half a cookie which made the $4 price tag ok. I nibbled on all of these and was totally unimpressed. No thought goes into the kids meals apparently. He gulped half of my juice, which was good.   My friend had a falafel and a potatoes that were served with a pomegranate bbq sauce. I only tasted the potatoes and sauce and it was actually quite good.   After lunch I bought some macaroons and donut holes (all raw) out of the deli case and they were ok. I liked them but they didn't wow me.   I think that you should try this restaurant out for yourself. I really hope that your experience is better than mine. I really, really want to give this place a 5. In fact, I was hesitant to write this review just because I want them to succeed. I don't this can happen if they don't improve their menu and pricing. I will not return to pay $35 for mediocre food. It pains me to say this, but my first visit will be my last visit.",

Finished the scramble the next day, with a good dose of chipotle sauce just to give it some oomph.",

Their ingredients are extremely fresh and their dishes are beautifully plated for a casual cafe.   We tried the pesto presto sandwich, which consisted of avocado, sunflower sprouts, tomato slices and pesto on a whole wheat baguette. They give such a generous amount of avocado it is SO good, and the pesto flavor is perfect and not too over-powering. The tortilla soup was the best I've tried yet. We also had the BLT on whole wheat toast. They use tempeh bacon and it was delish!  We also tried the \"donut holes\" - if you check-in on foursquare (1st time only) you get a free donut hole.  Well, they were definitely not the donut hole I was expecting - basically a ball of organic raw type ingredients...of what I'm not sure but the two flavors they had resembled the taste of a Lara Bar - just in a ball. :)  Only downside is that it is a little pricier for their sandwiches/ lunch. But definitely worth it!",

Everything is so good. I will drive miles out of my way just to go and get a cupcake after the gym or some scones for the next morning. Try their chocolate pomegranate cupcake and their chocolate pomegranate truffles. Their cowgirl cookies are so yummy, too. Oh, and the best part is you can order a cake!! a delicious, moist vegan cake! I will finally be able to have a birthday cake! Portions are pretty small for the tab you pay, I don't really leave full (especially if I go after a workout). I understand most restaurants serve huge portions of bad food and so we are used to over-eating, but I am a pretty small/petite woman and it definitely doesn't fill me up, but I'm so happy to have something healthy and yummy available that it is still one of my favorites.",

Every time I go in there it's always really busy but the food comes out within minutes and its delicious. In practice of being a vegan or at least a vegetarian, they make it very easy to stick to a healthy diet. I usually always get the avocado sandwich which comes with egg but I substitute it with the tofu option and it tastes exactly the same, if not better. Every meal usually comes with a side and they make their own juices right there in front of you, which are also super healthy and delicious.  The Pomegranate staff is super friendly and I wouldn't want that place to do anything different.",

    "text": "The Pomegranate Cafe was recently named \"Best New Restaurant\" by Phoenix Magazine, which is a lifestyle rag for urbanites with dollars to burn.  The restaurant in question is in Chandler, home to many of these people.  However, Pomegranate Cafe is family-owned and vegan-friendly, so I had to check it out.  Everything on the menu is vegetarian and can be made vegan.  There are also gluten-free and raw options, so there's something for everybody.    The restaurant serves breakfast foods like tofu scrambles, French toast, and breakfast burritos, but when I went, I chose a vegan BLT from their lunch menu.  It was made with delicious smoky tempeh \"bacon,\" and the addition of avocado was nice.  My hot date ordered a pesto sandwich, which he declared pasty but tasty.  Neither sandwich was huge, but they come with a spinach-pomegranate salad and some veggie chips.  You get a full plate of food, and everything is extremely fresh, but I wasn't too stoked on the salad, though my hot date liked it.  It would have been nice to have a choice of sides, like some fries or potato salad or something, but that was not the case.  We also split a berry smoothie, which was pretty tasty.  It was no tsoynami, but...what is?  They also had a good selection of vegan desserts, such as cookies, donut holes, cakes and even cheesecake.  We got a slice of chocolate cake topped with pomegranate seeds to go, and it was delicious.  It's so rare to find dairy- and egg-free desserts.  The atmosphere was bright, clean and cheerful.  It was an enjoyable meal for sure.  My main gripe about the place brings me right back to my first paragraph: everything was sooo damn expensive.  Sandwiches are $8-$12, the smoothie was friggin' $7, and the slice of cake was $6.    So, if you wanna splurge and try a new vegan place on the far east side of town, it's definitely worth a try.  But unless you're one of those rich people that can afford things, you might want to bring a friend and split some stuff.  The food is tasty, but I don't think I'll go back because I wouldn't dream of spending that kind of money on a meal these days.",

    "text": "Hi everybody!  This is a tough review for me because I shop at trader joes almost exclusively and my wife and I watched and waited for this restaurant to open. Granted it has been open for awhile it took us some time to get to it. I am not really sure it was open many times as we passed and were hungry. Finally we checked the menu and CHACHING!  So we moved it to the top of the list for trying and we were excited to come. As we only eat out on shopping day. Maybe too much. As usual whenever we eat at any restaurant we asked our \"vegan\" questions. We were told that someone there was a vegan nazi and if it says vegan it is, and this is very good.   I will say that i do trust that Pomegranate Cafe serves what they say they serve and the food was very high quality and very delicious. We shared the lentil burger ($12) that was on the menu board behind the counter. I really wanted to try the desserts but decided to wait till next time.  Everything was going great and we waited patiently for our food. Granted it was busy so it took a little time and this also is ok.   Here is where my problems begin. Bellieve me I do not want to give ANY business ANY time only 2 stars.  Trust me i just don't and i feel bad for doing so however, I did say on my profile that the reviews i do are very important to me. I am the kind of person who does not mince words and you will know where you stand with me. If i see something i do not like i will say so.    That being said  Now I will say that I have worked in the restaurant industry since i was 16. I have done every side job known to everyone who has set foot into a kitchen. (explained later) I have helped build business for many. Though I do not have any degrees or anything I have seen many meals being sent to customers in many differents ways, and styles. Some were good, some were bad, some were happy, some were mad. But they all ate and they either came back or they didn't. Currently I work in not one but two very popular digs. I work very hard to make sure my customers are happy, and i know how hard it is to work in a small family place. I worked at a local chinese restaurant for 6 years and barely got  a day off.  Do not get me wrong there is nothing wrong with the food here. my issue is with one small thing or two.   Why does a new business in the realm of Pomegranate (a higher class cafe which serves vegan food) charge a plate splitting fee which i believe was $2.00. Then give us our food on a paper plate. Please, this is ridiculous. We always split our food no matter where we go. It is pratically the only way you can stay healthy these days. Not to mention we believe that there was no more food for this charge. (for example: if there were more chips or pickles or fruit, then i do not have a problem with this fee. however I would say when asked to split. \" OK, no problem, however there will be a $?.?? charge, and for that you will recieve ....) if i would have known this i would have gotten it to go and this review would be totally different. And in my humble opinion it is not a good idea to charge this fee in an uber difficult restaurant \"genre\".    Believe me there are lots of people like me who want food like this. Do not make it harder on yourself by adding on fees which really are not necessary! Are you not making enough money off of $0.25 worth of lentils?  I also have to say that I had trouble choosing something to eat from the menu, because many things were scratched off. ???? Were they out of that item? I think the thing that bothered me about this was there were so many that i wanted to try but could not. I saw many that had promise, as I am a vegan nazi and i really was stoked to eat here. It is my kind of place almost to a t. Too bad that did not work out.  Now for the side job part.   While we waited for our food i noticed that this restaurants dining room was not very clean. the floor looked as if it had not been cleaned for a few days, the windows were very dirty, and the window sills were covered, and i mean covered in dust. Complete with cobwebs. From what i could tell the kitchen was clean.   Here is how I see it. Please do not serve a $14.50 burger on a paper plate EVER! To me this says that the staff does not want to do dishes, If something is on your menu keep it there, when people find something they like they will come back no matter how much it costs if they know it will be there. Clean your dining room! it is uber, uber ,uber important that your customers see a clean dining room. it does not take that long and it will go very far impressing your customers, especially when you are first getting started. When a restaurant does not take the time to clean thier dining room they most likely are not cleaning thier kitchen as well. I hope this is not the case with Pomegranate because I really would like to try more food here. I only will know by stopping by again.   Thank for reading.   Late, Greg",

Don't try to serve me brocolini - just give me broccoli. Or better yet, just give me a small tree because I am a man and when I eat, I mean business.  Due to this, I avoided the Pomegranate Cafe for a long time, because what am I going to do with a tofu burrito? That's not real food. And a taco made with walnut meat? Walnuts aren't meat - they're wood. I don't want that.  Anyway, my wife talked me into coming here, and I have to take everything back. This place has serious flavor - flavor that would scare lesser men. I had a burrito without any meat in it - not even eggs, and it was both filling, and really, really delicious. Also, they have some pretty wild deserts here, so even if you're not willing to try bread made of cauliflower, try the chocolate cake, or even better - the banana cake.  Do know that they are slow - like... extremely slow. If you have the time, it's worth it, but don't come here if you've got somewhere to be afterwards.  Also, they have fake bacon, which is nothing like real bacon. I'm not saying it's bad - just don't order it if you're like me and expect what you're used to.  Other than that, enjoy! And I recommend sitting outside - they've got a lovely patio and a basket full of squirt bottles to ward off any adventurous birds.",

I had to box half of it and take it home where someone else made the discovery and devoured it.   The restaurant is kid friendly and the kids in our group enjoyed cheese crisps and fresh fruit.  If you make it known to your server that there are allergy issues with anyone in your group, you will not be surprised with the ingredients in your meal.  It has been awhile since I last posted a review on Pomegranate since it is far from my home.  It is well worth the drive.  There is a discernable difference in taste between the chain restaurants and the mom and pop establishments.  In this case, the \"mom\", is an outstanding cook and entrepreneur.",

    "text": "Pomegranate Cafe is popular-and for good reason. The all-vegan cafe with a few egg and dairy options for less-strict vegetarians had a line out the door, with 10 people ahead of me, when I arrived for Sunday brunch. And that line didn't decrease over the entire hour I was there.  It might be the reputation the suburban success in Ahwatukee, Ariz., has garnered as one of the very rare restaurants that serves a vegan brunch every day of the week. Or, it could just be the spectacular food. (I saw at least one culinary institute coat and I can assure you, these people know how to cook.)  Be forewarned: Dishes here are too numerous to choose from. You'll be compelled, more likely compulsed, to come back.  My dining companion and I had the In Season Scramble-hers with dairy and eggs, mine without.  Both were delicious and accompanied by \"harvest hash\" (a surprisingly balanced medley of potatoes, sweet potatoes, kale, peppers and other veggies) plus toast and homemade jam.  I consider this simply an introduction to the restaurant, which boasts a tantalizing array of vegan desserts (make no mistake: The baked-goods counter is food porn at its best-resistance is futile), not to mention smoothies, raw dishes and lunch offerings that would have any foodie's palate irrevocably aroused.  I'm coming back for the Raw! Lasagne, \"Today's Burger\" (I had plate envy of the diners next to me), Wild Western Tacos and mmm, mmm, mmm, like everything in the dessert counter. (Please, chocolate cake, be there upon my return). If you live within 25 miles of this place, it's worth a trip simply as a dining destination.  To view the menu in depth (warning: not for the faint of willpower!), visit <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pomegranatecafe.com%2Fpdfs%2Fmenu-2012-fall.pdf&s=44c990596e9e4718dc1426b087ccf1e4a8dd1af7b20477903e4a3989c2ef89ee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pomegranatecafe.com/pdfs...</a>.",

Quality ingredients, skillful preparation and wonderful presentation made our meal enjoyable. We sampled the breakfast burrito, avocado and egg sandwich, fresh juices and a Milky Way coffee. The fresh veggies, tepary beans and were tasty and nothing was over cooked. There were no salt and pepper shakers on the table- they weren't needed because everything was seasoned just right! The comfortable, light and inviting atmosphere completed the experience. We will be back!",

We went yesterday around noon, so I was expecting it to be busy. Every sit was full except for the bar so we went to sit there and basically was ignored. If, we didn't flag anyone down, I'm pretty sure we weren't ever going to be helped by anyone. When we finally flagged someone down and ordered, we waiting about 20 minutes for the food which wasn't bad timing. I am a little surprised on how expensive it was, hence for another -1 star. For 2 bowls and water, my bill came to about 30 bucks. Yikes. I could've went to Panda that was down the street and have leftovers.   Besides the expensiveness and the bad customer service, the food tasted really good and the portion wasn't too bad (although, for paying 30 bucks for 2 plates, I expected bigger portion of food). Other than that, here have 3 stars on me.",

I had no idea I lived so close to a vegan restaurant that also has raw-vegan options and I'm so happy this place is delicious!  I got the mermaid salad last night to go and though the tofu was rather over cooked and a bit too salty the rest of the salad was delightful. I'm a bit of a salt fiend but I think next time I'll order this salad sans the tofu.   This morning I dined in for a late breakfast with my non-vegan boyfriend. I had the Pomuffin and he had the Avocado Sandwich and he actually enjoyed it! We both appreciated the freshness and portion sizes. The drip coffee is really great, I can't wait to try the lattes and desserts next time.",

I ordered the In-Season Egg Scramble, which came with a delicious stir fry of fresh vegetables, and yummy multi-grain toast! I love their toast! Much more fun than the regular wheat toast at most breakfast places, with a yummy berry jam! My friends ordered the multi-grain toast with almond butter, which was beautifully plated (with pomegranate seed topping!) and looked delicious as well! (And is a good way to go if you don't want a large portion). The best part, nothing felt heavy/greasy!  They also have an assortment of baked goods and desserts, which looked delicious! And they have complimentary cucumber water, which was super refreshing! I'm excited to come back and try their juices as well!",

They're expanding their space once again, but I wish they'd open a second location in Arcadia, folks up here would eat that ish UP.   Service can be pretty slow at times, but I can tell they're making an effort to speed it up, and honestly, I just don't care. Good food takes time and hipsters operate on their own internal clocks, so just expect it or gtfo. Soup and salad lunch is always a good choice if you really need to get in and out in an hour, otherwise order for pickup, make sure to pay over the phone, and take it back to the office or even monge on the patio.  I love the Rainbow Wrap, and the Falafel Caesar. Kale Salad is a good standby too. I wish they'd do a slightly refined dinner service on Friday and Saturdays with a changing menu, but I appreciate that they stick to their strengths, breakfast and lunch. Honestly, I haven't even tried 90% of the menu, but I can say without hesitation that it all is good.  And O, thee breakfast. I've only been there once for it but damn was it tasty.  If you wanna get your inner hippie on, get to Pomegranate. Seriously the best green eats evar.",

    "text": "Sarah H and I came in for lunch today because we've been both wanting to try it for a while.  The restaurant was bustling when we arrived so we waited line and ordered our lunch.  I settled on the Elephant Curry Bowl, recommended by the cashier and Sarah ordered the Daily Burger which was a sweet potato burger today and a pomegranate lemonade.  We took our table market and found a place to sit and chatted while we waited for our food.    Her lemonade came out first.  It looked like the pomegranate was fresh squeezed.  I forget her exact words but something like it was interesting.  She drank most of it, but not all.  Also, the glass of lemonade was on the small side.  Not what I would expect for $3.  Our meals came out and my Elephant Bowl looked good.  Yellow curry with lots of fresh vegetables and brown rice and tofu.  Everything I like.  Maybe I should have just ended the meal there before the disappointment set in. For a curry it was terribly bland and strangely enough made my tongue numb.  I ended up bringing the majority of it home and spiced it up a bit so I could finish it.  I had a bite of Sarah's burger and it was pretty good.  It tasted predominately of sweet potatoes and lentils, but I enjoy both of those.  She had the root vegetable fry's on the side and those were good as well seasoned with rosemary.    I would like to try this place again.  I noticed that many of the reviews were not good for many's first visit but then improved with their second.  It might be good for Abu J with his vegan/supermodel diet.  I'm curious what he'll think of it.",

I settled on the scramble (tofu) of the day which was with maple tempeh and dairy free cheese (daiya), sweet potato hash, and gluten free-vegan toast. I had never had a tofu scramble or tempeh so I was nervous I was going to be left disappointed and hungry! It was quite the opposite. The portion was perfect and the food was delicious!   My husband, who doesn't have any food allergies, ordered the enchilada scramble (regular eggs) which also came with the sweet potato hash and regular toast. He loved his meal! He mentioned that the enchilada sauce was so flavorful!  We both ordered lattes, his with regular milk and mine with soy milk. They were both pretty good but def not great.

For those of you that need a little more info / aka a bigger -nudge- to be persuaded to try this great place...check out my long winded love letter -oh, I mean overview. I hope you find it to be honest, humorous & helpful:  Pomegranate Cafe' is sincerely a WONDERFULLY delightful place! ....& it is truly a DREAM COME TRUE! The the newly decorated window of this awesomely vibrant, yet quaint and cozy cafe reads 3 simply lovely words:  *Local* Seasonal*Organic   The day that I saw this sign I knew I was in love...or- that a small piece of heaven had quite literally landed in my \"backyard\" (-aka it's just a few blocks from my home! yippee!). I then sighed with an unmistakable sense of  \"finally, a breath of \"fresh air!\"...in a world of lack luster fast, processed foods- a place I can go to be free from it all...close to home.  A locally owned cafe of this high quality caliber (again they organic, seasonal and even some Live/Raw items), comfort and affordability I feel is very a rare thing...Not forgetting to mention that  this cafe is NOT located in Downtown/ Metro PHX...It located in Ahwatukee! It's right next to Trader Joe's on 38th & Chandler Blvd!     This place will be mos def. be my \"hangout\" from now on, whenever possible- until I either leave PHX, or pass into another life! I am only 30- so I hope that it isn't the latter! By the way, in jest- I told the owner, Cassie that if I could I would love to just sign over my paycheck to her, & I meant it! She would only have to share it with a few other fave places like Changing Hands Bookstore,Trader Joe's,W.Foods & Agritopia(& Joe' s BBQ), (& the local farmer's mkts.)! Well, since that isn't possible of course I will just have to continue to support this little awesome local business in any way I can!  Which bring me to the last, but certainly not least... Mentioning of he cafe's {glorious} offerings! Seriously. I mean this...Sincerely superb!!!! Everything on the menu is so very fresh and equally fresh tasting! I would be hard pressed to think that anything you could ever order from Pomegranate to be any less than perfect & enjoyable!   My very first visit, on their {soft} opening day- I had a severe cold and the nice young lady / staff made me an herbal tea called \"Vitali-Tea.\" After that very 1st visit- I was truthfully dumbfounded and struck down by the very feeling of unadulterated *love* embodied by a physical place! I counted the days until I could make the time to visit again! My 2nd visit was actually just yesterday. I hadn't eaten anything in the morning, it was way past lunch & and I was extremely hungry! I was also very tired from a company mting- which was in freaking Peoria! (grrr!)- & as I passed by Phoenix's demure skyline (*i'm from NWI/ Chicagoland area*) my tummy & mind wandered through the \"Roosevelt Row\" area of metroPHX... However, I was drawn closer & closer to home in Ahwatukee, not just by the promise of sleep but also by the overwhelming desire to visit Pomegranate once again. I stepped in the Cafe' with a big appetite and little desire to spend a great deal of $...Pay day, bills and such...pending...a horrible concoction...So I decided on the quiche of the day which came w/ a (phenomenally fresh) house salad. I then splurged and opted for some energy in the form of a cup of fresh-squeezed juice drink called \"Laughter.\" I broke out my net-book, sat down to eat....And my mouth was over taken by the fresh flavor of each individual item that I ordered as I ate it. Complete taste bud loveliness...and overload at the same time! I kid you not! I even had tea & dessert! I sat for at least over an hour, eating slowly enjoying eat bite. Computer screen blank. I just read the drink menu instead (...also i forgot my log-on password btw-lol!)..yet...I was still amazed as I throughly read through each drink description. The drink offerings / menu are the size of a \"normal sized\"/8x12 food menu. The mind blowing variations of teas, fresh squeezed juices & even elixirs on both front and back.  And that's just the drinks! The food is amazing!  \"Love\" awaits you too! ;-)  Gottah go!  Sincerely, S.",

The dishes are simple and there is enough variety to appease just about anybody. The main problem with this restaurant is the execution of these dishes. The food is bland, vegetables are soggy and wet, and the meat substitutes are poorly prepared and undercooked. I have been a vegetarian for 16 years, and I eat mostly vegan. My diet consists mostly of fresh vegetables, so I am no stranger to this type of cuisine. The ingredients used are fantastic, they just need to better season and cook them. If that were to happen, 2 stars would be added to this review. The other star would be earned from making the dining room more comfortable. Every table was filthy, and I mean filthy. Crusted old liquids and crumbs adorned them all. The thermostat is dangling from an electrical wire from the ceiling in the middle of the restaurant. The wall paint is splotchy and unfinished.   While this review is very critical (as reviews should be), it is not intended to damage this restaurant's reputation. The owners have a very solid idea, but it is obvious that there is an absence of a talented chef. If the Pomegranate Cafe invests in paying more attention to flavor and a more inviting atmosphere, they will have a 5-star restaurant.",

Other than that, it is good food.   Everything I have had here is good.  This last time, I got the rainbow wrap but, instead of having it wrapped in kollard greens I got it in a spinach tortilla.  Very good, healthy and filling without feeling too stuffed.",

(Not my strong point) so I had heard that Pomegranate had a small selection of desserts that were gluten free. Desperate NOT to bake myself I went in,... Low and behold I hit the mother load of deliciousness!  There were so many options that we could both have it was amazing! Since I could not decide, we got pretty much one of everything (some items we did get 2 of) and there was not 1 thing that I tried that was not fantastic!  Even my children who crave refined sugar and corn syrup and various garbage thought everything was delicious.  It was not until AFTER they had ingested it all did I mention that they were actually healthy treats!  I cannot wait to go back very soon!",

On the minus side the first choice of meals was unavailable, however I was given the option to wait while they went to trader joes next store to grab soy chorizo. The portions small, we waited 15 minutes for one coffee, and  30 minutes for the other.  my 4 dollar mocha missed the yuminess mark, and my wifes cup of joe was not delicious enough to remind her she had wanted it before eating most of her meal. At a half hour wait we went to check on coffee two, when it was delivered it was not with a smile or apology, but with annoyed a toss the cream onto the table in a huff during delivery. The shop uses mason jars or old fruit jars for glasses, neato recycling effort,  Bright burgundy lipstick on one of the water jars not as welcome. We watched the inattentive staff ignoring orders to go out from our seats.  I was definitely not feeling the service or care love of the staff. Unfortunately the vegan wife left very unhappy with the 40 dollars spent on breakfast for three, leaving still hungry, and feeling poorly treated.",

    "text": "We live about 25 miles from this restaurant, so it took us many months to find an opportunity to eat here.  After a strenuous hike at South Mountain Park, I forced my boyfriend to take me to Pomegranate Cafe for a late lunch.  I saw this restaurant on Check  Please,  Arizona several months ago and since we are watching our gluten and animal product intake, I was excited to try it.  My boyfriend is French, and graduated from culinary school in France.  So, needless to say, he is freaking picky as hell.  Taking him to new restaurants that I choose can be a nightmare.   So, on to the food!  I had the lumberjack sandwich, and since I was really starving, I ordered the kale salad as well.  The boyfriend had the omelet of  the day with fresh herbs and veggies.  EVERYTHING was delicious!  It's a miracle!!  After the complaining about not being able to order a cold beer after our 2 1/2 hour hike, he shut up and ate everything, commenting on how good it was.  This is nothing short of a miracle!  The staff is very nice, friendly and helpful.  I'm in the service business, so I really appreciate that.  The ingredients are top notch, and thoughtfully put together, and so good.  The hash that's on the side of the sandwich and the omelet was so good, I would have just had a big bowl of that!  For dessert, we had the Caribbean pineapple coconut cheesecake and a chocolate pomegranate cake ball, and a chocolate macaroon.   The French guy loved the cheesecake, and he's an expert on cheesecake.  All the chocolate desserts were super good and the coffee was great, too.  I will say we tried Green vegetarian restaurant about 2 years ago, and that was a disaster.  We also went to Santa Monica last summer, and tried Real Food Daily, which we thought was kind of bland.  So to get the boyfriend to try another vegetarian place was rather difficult.   We might actually be back!  Like I said, we live far away, but we could make a day out of having lunch, and then hitting Trader Joe's next door!  So convenient!   Thank you, the staff at Pomegranate Cafe, for putting out such a quality product.  You guys are great!",

    "text": "UPDATED REVIEW on 10/30/2017: Cassie, one of the owners, reached out to me the same afternoon as my original review (below) and apologized, which I greatly appreciate! She really went above and beyond to make sure that she understood my experience, and we had a nice conversation about the cafe. She was honest about areas of improvement, and explained to me the reasoning behind some of the policies. I was also offered my order at no charge, so I had a chance to actually try them. The cinnamon rolls are MASSIVE, and are quiet good. Thank you, Cassie!  At this point, my impression of the cafe has certainly improved. I was already favorable with the tone of customer service at Pomegranate Cafe, and after interacting with the management, it's all the higher. I'm glad to try more dishes and pastries in the future, and will recommend PC to my vegetarian and vegan friends. :-)  ------  ORIGINAL REVIEW from 10/28/17 - one star: I want to start by saying that the staff is incredibly friendly. Very personable. But aside from them, my experience with Pomegranate Cafe was poor.   I was given a gift card to PC, which I had never tried before, so this was my first (and frankly, last) experience there. I had called ahead of time to place a small pickup order for the next morning. Nothing major, just six cinnamon rolls. I'm told that it's going to be an extra $20 because it's considered a \"rush\" order for not ordering 48 hours ahead of time.  Little weird - and steep - but fine...the gift card will cover it.   They ask for payment information, and I tell them I'll be paying with a gift card. That's not accepted over the phone, and they won't place the order until it's paid for. Okay...so, we get special permission from the manager to order my six cinnamon rolls with an assurance that it will be paid for when I pick them up at 8:30 the next morning.   I arrive at 8:30 on the dot, specify that I need to pay, and the guy (super nice) checks to see if the rolls are ready. They're not. Apparently, they burned the cinnamon rolls and need to remake them. But I'm still going to be charged the $20 rush fee, and they won't be ready for pickup for another HOUR. This was not going to work, since I had placed the order specifically to get them on my way to a 9am meeting.   Long story short: the order was cancelled, I've still never eaten there, and I guess the corrected cinnamon rolls are now orphans.",

She was very friendly and it helped sitting in front of the dessert display distracting us in how delicious everything looked. Outer waiter was a gentlemen and even though he was swamped that Tuesday he was very friendly and polite.

Our server waited until our food was about to come out to tell us they were out of the stuff for the elephant bowl and it will be 20 more minutes fir the dragon bowl. Very annoying. Then the casadilla came out and was very different from last time, had no cheese on it, and was kind of awful. The nachos had a minuscule amount of cheese and when we asked the server why things were so different he acted surprised like he didn't know what we were talking about.  I think we will be taking a break from this place for a while. At these prices they cant afford poor service and subpar food.   So the manger came over before we left and we told her what happened. She cut our bill in half and apologized, explaining there is a new chef.  She was very nice about it and we appreciate her listening. Also, we bought some cowgirl chocolate tarts to go and they were the bomb!",

Unfortunately that's not gonna happen. We were sat right away, server came right over, super sweet and friendly, got our drink orders (my husband and I ordered two different iced teas, which they brought out with both flavors mixed in one glass? Typing that makes me laugh)  Ok whatever, no big. We order food and wait. And wait. And wait. ALMOST FORTY FIVE MINUTES FROM ORDER TO TABLE! Then. My order came out wrong. The one thing I was most excited to try, the TLT, wasn't even brought out and I had to ask for it. Oh btw ask me how many times our teas (once put in delegate glasses were refilled in the hour and a half we were there. The answer is zero) Now we're rushing and order a dessert to go, our server took like $3.00 off the $65.00 bill. Um cool thanks.  In the midst of this, I'm watching the manager (I think?) go around checking on other tables, not once did she come by our table during the ridiculous wait or after just to be like hey sorry about that.  The food was good. Didn't love the root veggies. But the sliders were yum and my kiddo loooooved the French toast. But honestly by the time it got there, we were so rushed it's not like I could enjoy it no matter how great it was.",

They really do a fantastic job of keeping their food flavorful and interesting, it almost makes including meat in your food seem like cheating.  I had the supreme burrito and have to recommend it as it really was delish.  While the menu may seem daunting at first and all the 'meat' in quotes seems odd, you get over it real quick once you get your food and get a taste.  If you are like me and tend to stay away from vegan places, this is defiantly the one to risk it at!  The coffee here is also good.  Now that we've had many years of the Starbucks $5 espresso drinks, the price point seems reasonable and you will find much better quality here than at a mass market place.  They also have some really interesting vegan 'cream' that is quite good.  Also, good hint for those looking for food they will recognize.  Head over before 2pm for breakfast/brunch.  Their egg based dishes are excellent, tasty and completely reasonable for those seeking traditional protein.  Only warning, the price point is a little above our normal range!  It just seems like more of a $12 instead of $18 place to me, but not enough to knock it down a star since you won't be able to find a legit comparison point.  It really is unique so give it a try and decide for yourself.",

Do NOT come here during any time where it's busy as you will literally be waiting for hours.   I wouldn't be so annoyed if we didn't order before every single table around us but they all are eating. But not us.   We just can't waste our time ever coming here agin unfortunately.",

I think the service has improved over the years, and I like the recent addition of table service. The desserts are to DIE for, and ALL vegan. You must try the Brazilian Brownie and the Chocolate Pomegranate Truffle. The owners are super sweet and are always around. You can tell they love and take pride in their product(s).  I would like to give them five stars because they're awesome, but the last two times I've felt like the portion was smaller and they completely left some ingredients out of my bowl last time. They did promptly remedy the missing ingredients. I hope they don't do what every other restaurant does and keep charging the same or more and lessen the quality and portion size!   This place is a MUST For vegans and non vegans!",

When the Door Dash delivery driver arrived, he was told that my second choice was also not available, and that if I wanted to order anything else to-go it would be 45 minutes. This was AFTER I'd already waited nearly an hour for my order.   I understand that Door Dash employees aren't the actual customer, but they represent us. They are there for us. And the fact that the manager of this restaurant, that I so loved going to, treated him and me - by way of my delivery driver - so poorly makes me want to never visit again.   UPDATE: After much back and forth between Pomegranate and Door Dash, it all boiled down to this from Pomegranate:  \"You should ask Door Dash to refund your money for today's poor service.\" (And I did get a refund from DD without having to ask for it because DD apparently cares about its customers, so ...)  Wow.  Passing the buck. Thanks for looking out for yourselves and not your customers.",

Pomegranate Cafe has us both covered with numerous menu choices plus a great dessert case.  I first tried this place with Laura L., and I was delighted with the lumberjack sandwich (tofu and regular cheese) and sweet potato hash . The sandwich was great, and despite the name, it was a reasonable size. I also had a nice latte along with my breakfast. At the time, I paid with a gift certificate so I didn't pay attention to how pricey it was.  I returned for lunch while my car was being tuned up, and I got a massive burrito filled with quinoa and veggies. It came with a lightly dressed salad on the side. I brought home a carrot cupcake for my husband, and he thought it was great. My lunch, latte and dessert was nearly $30.   Perhaps Pomegranate Cafe isn't a great value, but all the food is delicious. It's an excellent choice for those of us with special diets.",

I recall the best vegan nut nog possible. The high prices were worth the months of fond food recollection. I decided the other day to order one to go, however, this time the nog was bitter, chunky, and a complete waste of $8.  I threw it in the garbage once I got home. I have noticed other menu items that no longer meet the praise I have been dishing out to my friends so I will stop recommending your restaurant. I'm sure there is still plenty of good food but this is supposed to be THE place for food purists, IMO.    UPDATE  I'm happy to report that on subsequent visits since my mediocre review last year I have been generally very happy with this restaurant. They made my last complaint right and I support their mission to creat great vegan food. I can't give 5 stars yet because I feel portion sizes for the price are a little small but I'm glad Pomegranate is around supporting local foodies.  Keep up the good work!",

    "text": "It should be said that Cassie and Marlene Tolman have done an important thing for the valley food scene.  Restaurants focused on organic, healthy, and environmentally conscious products are relatively easy to find in various urban parts of the valley.  The suburbs on the other hand are typically a parade of chains dishing out high volumes of product that often only pay lip service to those who seek out sustainably produced and harvested foods.  By locating their fledgling business in Ahwatukee, the Tolmans have taken a gamble on spreading that business model to very edge of the valley.  A gamble that has clearly paid off.  Pomegranate is a fairly lengthy drive from my apartment, but I've really enjoyed sampling some of their foods at various food festivals here in the valley (the PHX Vegan Festival being the most recent).  Looking to get the full experience of Pomegranate, I made my way here for breakfast on Saturday morning.  On the southeast corner of 40th Street & Chandler in the Safeway shopping complex, you'll find Pomegranate by virtue of their fenced in outdoor patio lined with tall wooden tables and umbrellas.  Inside the restaurant is a beautiful array of color (pink being the most dominant among them) with the the sit down restaurant on the left and a small market on the right selling a variety of food and non-food products.  I came at the opening expecting a busy Easter weekend crowd (which sure enough filled the place within an hour).  I grabbed a table in the corner to take it all in.  The menu as noted earlier is focused heavily on organic and sustainable products.  No GMO products allowed and the bulk of the food is vegan (with some vegetarian alternatives available).  They source locally, compost their leftovers, and much of the menu changes with what's available in season.  The first menu item that caught my attention was the Chimpanzee Bowl.  Granola, banana, seasonal fruit (in this case, strawberries), and what they call a \"superfood mix\" (I picked up on a variety of nuts as well as some coconut and dried berries).  Douse it with their \"Po\" Milk (essentially milk made from various nuts and seeds) and you've got a giant bowl of granola, nut & fruit cereal.  I loved this.  Clean fresh flavors with a balanced sweetness from the fresh fruit (including the dried berries).  Footnote: The cafe donates $1 to the Jane Goodall Institute (a global wildlife and environmental conservation organization) for every Chimpanzee Bowl ordered.    I also ordered something they only sell during weekend breakfast hours.  One of their giant cinnamon rolls.  Came out to me fresh out of the oven.  This isn't the biggest cinnamon roll I've ever seen (The Machine Shed in Iowa still holds that title), but its pretty large (I'd guess 4\"W x 4\"L x 2\"H).  The cinnamon roll was okay, but didn't knock my socks off.  I was expecting a smoother texture coming straight from the oven, but it was a little nutty and grainier than I wanted.  I prefer cinnamon rolls where the breading and frosting do most of the talking, but that's just me.  Lastly, to wash it all down, I got one of their juice drinks called The Rainbow.  A mixture of beets, apple, kale, ginger, orange, carrot, and cucumber juices.  As intriguing as it sounded, the flavor was absolutely not my thing.  I guess I was expecting the fruits and the cucumber to be a little more dominant but all I could really make out were the beets.  If you love beet juice you'd probably love this drink.  I only got about halfway through mine before I just couldn't handle it anymore.  Total price for the food, drink, tax, and tip came to about $35.  Having dined at plenty of vegan and vegetarian establishments in my time, I'm fully aware that restaurants focused on sustainability can (and often do) mean paying a premium.  Still, for many Pomegranate Cafe likely wouldn't be an affordable every day (or even every week) option.  Based on the response they've received from the Ahwatukee community it seems as though plenty are willing to make the journey here, which I'm glad about.  As more restaurants look to innovate using a sustainable model similar to what the Tolmans are using, perhaps the price point will be such that places like Pomegranate can reach a larger audience.  From my own experience, Pomegranate is great in spots, not so great in others, but completely committed to their model of sustainability.  I would come back for a quick bite for breakfast or lunch if I were in the neighborhood, but probably on a special occasion basis only.",

Did not give me any option to order at that time or ask me what I actually wanted to drink.  About 15 minutes later she came back to take my order, never asked me what I actually wanted to drink.  I came to this place because I called that morning to ask them if they had vegan pancakes and the girl on the phone told me every day until 12... then my server told me oh that's actually on the weekends. Cool, so I drove 30 minutes out here for poor service with out pancakes lol   I know you were understaffed the day after Christmas. There were two servers handling the entire restaurant but as a bartender I know the difference between slow and good service and slow and poor service. Very poor service. No one asked my how my food was, I had to get up and refill my own water glass and I had to stare down my waitress with my card in my hand just so I could pay.

It looked like such a warm cool relaxed atmosphere...  When I walked in to pick up my order I really liked what I saw ... Very cool decorations and to be honest it reminded me of my house and I truly felt @ home.  The best was when I got home and bit into one of the Wild West (Breakfast) Tacos, and yes I will admit it was definitely a party in my mouth!!  The savory taste running through my taste buds was such a great feeling ... If you haven't figured it out by now I loved the Wild West Tacos, and of course who doesn't love fresh squeezed OJ?!?!  The gentleman that took my take out order was great ... I told him that it was my first time placing an order, so he gave me the detailed run down on all the possibilities. There are so many different healthy options here that I was truly amazed when I heard all the different ways/modes/mediums they can incorporate when creating your meal ;) VERRRY coool stuff my Yelp friends!!  It is definitely an absolutely charming cafe ... I do have one suggestion though ... SERVE BREAKFAST ALL DAY and you will have me hooked!  Please!!??  In regards to the Wild West Tacos - they were        H-U-G-E!!!! And they tasted magically delicious, and you could taste the fresh ingredients ... So I can't complain about the price point of $12 - I think it's reasonably priced based on the portion.  However, I do think $6 for a cup of OJ seemed to be excessive, maybe offer a larger size @ that price point ....?  Otherwise I will probably do without the OJ in the future.  I would absolutely recommend everyone to my newest favorite spot, because it would just be irresponsible not to tell people about how awesome the Pomegranate Cafe is!! ;)",

My meal (macaroni and cheese with pesto) Was served to me just warm instead of hot like it had been sitting on the steam table for a while so I ask her to take it back and microwave it or something to heat it up and then I had to wait another 15 minutes. When I finally ask what it happened to my meal, The waitress brought it but it came back again just warm, like they left it sitting on the steam table. The other times I have had this dish when it is served hot it's absolutely delicious and it's enough for two people even though it is somewhat pricey. My friend had the quesadillas and she was not impressed with her choice. We left feeling somewhat gypped due to the fact of being rushed and then not having our meal served at proper temperatures.  The owner needs to have a discussion with her employees about customer service. Also serving hot food hot and cold food cold!",

This place is exactly why we were motivated to try a meatless day, and the best by far!   Their food is my personal ideal when it comes to wholesome, plant-based deliciousness. Tried the tacos vivos, and my plate was exploding with color and flavor! The tacos were amazing, and the side salad was surprisingly incredible too! It also all left me with that happy belly feeling, where you are full and content in a way you just feel good about.  There were so many other seriously enticing items on the menu too.  I left really happy this place is local and I can come back to try more soon! The service was also really good and friendly, and the atmosphere is awesome too.   Would be pumped to come back any day of the week!",

The only drawback is the price. I once split a meal and it was $45/person for lunch. All I ordered was a sandwich, drink, and dessert.  It added up fast.  But, you pay for quality and the quality was there. Very good,  enjoy! Maybe skip dessert and save a few bucks, but that will be hard because the desserts are sooo good.",

I've always worked in restaurants and know how it can be a challenge to focus on a table outside of your section but I did not think the service could be that poor. My party (2 adults and a child) arrived at 12 PM today and requested to sit outside. We were greeted promptly with water and flatware. During that visit, I requested a kids apple juice. It took more than 10 minutes for the juice to be brought out. Then, our server (whose name I don't even know) took 50 minutes to bring out our entrees. There were parties sat after us who received food before us. I know that some orders may take less time to prepare but 50 minutes was ridiculous. The server had definitely forgotten about our order. He then was quite prompt to process a payment.  Although I may return because I enjoyed the food, I will definitely request a different server.",

    "text": "I have always wanted to love Pomegrante Cafe, but I have always had hit or miss food and/or service, so I never bothered to return after spring 2013.   In February 2016, after a near 3 year hiatus, I finally gave them another go.  I tried the raw tacos, a couple of street tacos, and a burger slider from their happy hour menu.  The raw taco, served with walnut \"meat\" was pretty tasty.  Everything else was just ok, and I found pieces of real cheese on my vegan plate, so I was thinking it may be another 3 years before I returned.  However, recently they posted items from their Summer 2016 menu, and I was enticed by their new banana split and hush puppy offerings.  I figured if I keep giving them chances, it'll eventually pay off.    We went during happy hour (which is 3pm-6pm, Mondays through Saturdays) on Friday, 29July16, and ordered a bunch of different things.  TEPARY I'ITOI HUSH PUPPIES - $12: I believe that hush puppies are a southern dish (but I won't swear to that), and from where I come, we love them.  They are fried balls of cornmeal/bread, mixed with onions and sometimes peppers.   My mistake was expecting these to taste like homemade southern hush puppies; they didn't. In their own right, they are pretty good, just not what I was expecting or wanting. Try them for yourself; you may love them! Over-priced.   TU-NUT SALAD SANDWICH - $14:  I omitted the sunflower ranch and tomatoes.  I enjoyed this dish. It was a tasty vegan tuna salad version on warm toasty bread. Only some vegan mayo spread on the bread would make it better. The seasonal side was potato salad, and theirs is pretty good.  Organic or not, for the portion, it was not worth $14; $10 maybe, but not $14.   GILA MONSTER NACHOS - $8 (HAPPY HOUR PRICE): This colorful dish comes with a huge heaping of corn chips, walnut taco \"meat\", beans, jalapeno, pico, and guacamole (I omitted the queso and sour cream, but the 1st order came out with both, so they had to remake it).  A deliciously satisfying dish which is large enough to share, although you may not want to. The regular price is $12. I would return for this dish any time of the day.  POM BANANA SPLIT - $10: Sliced banana coins, vegan vanilla ice cream scoops, chocolate syrup, caramel, brownies, and coconut whip cream. The description includes a Pomberry syrup, but I didn't see anything resembling berries or berry syrup. This dish was pretty darn good, but it could've been great if the ice cream didn't taste freezer-burnt. Also, the brownie had nuts in it, and this was not mentioned in their menu description.  Luckily, I am not allergic, but those with nut allergies should remember to always ask, as even the healthiest food venues don't always consider allergies when writing their menus.  Being that this dish is large enough to share, $8-$10 seems fair if it's in a perfect state (ice cream not icy and all described ingredients included).   DD got the Maca Magic Smoothie ($10), Napoleon Grilled Cheese Sandwich, with real cheese ($15!!), and the Root Beer float ($10).  She enjoyed the smoothie and drank almost all of it.  She didn't like that grilled cheese sandwich one bit and wasted my $15.  The Root Beer float was a hit; it came with 3 scoops of ice cream and a full bottle of root beer for her to pour herself.  Personally, I think the smoothie and root beer floats should be about $7-$8 each, not $10. The grilled cheese was completely over-priced.   My cousin ordered the BUFFALO HOT WINGS ($10), JAMAICAN CURRY WEDGES ($8 on HH menu; $12 regular price), BBQ Buffalo Wrap ($14), Macro Bowl ($14), Hibiscus Cooler ($6), and a Banana Split as well.  She absolutely loved every single thing that she got, which proves, to each his own.   I tried her Buffalo Hot Wings. The buffalo sauce on the wings was good, but I didn't like the texture of their wings.  She loved them.  I also tried the Jamaican Curry Wedges... LOL! No. I was expecting hella spice and flavor, but as colorful as was the presentation, it failed to deliver. Maybe under another name they wouldn't have been so disappointing? They were not bad, just not what I expected, given the name.  They certainly are not worth the $12 regular menu price. Try for yourself during HH, and save yourself $4.   Even though I wasn't 100% happy with everything, I can appreciate that the food was fresh, filling, and quite tasty.  Table service by Brittany was excellent. She was friendly and attentive without being over-present.    The main downfall, aside from location, is that they are just too expensive. If you get a drink, appetizer, main course and dessert, you're already at $50 per person! This isn't New York and they shouldn't be charging Phoenicians that much, organic or not.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this joint for over two years and I finally took the plunge to drive 30 minutes for lunch here. Walking up I was told to wait to be seated. It took another 10 minutes to have someone come over and give me water. The part that bothered me the most was the girls were behind the counter complaining how slow it was. They waited another 10 minutes before the waitress actually came over to me. At this time I ordered a $4 nitro cold brew coffee. I attempted to order my lunch at the same time but she walked away mid-sentence.  The coffee was 3 star taste, but I think it would have been better had it been colder. Perhaps I should have asked for ice, but it's odd to have nitro on ice.   When she came back I ordered the $13 buffalo \"chicken\" wrap. It came out rather quickly. Their fake chicken is spot-on! I really enjoyed it. Unfortunately it didn't taste anything like buffalo but rather bbq. It was even the color of bbq - maybe I was given the wrong one. Had they had a vegan cayenne-based hot sauce it would have been a lot better. I make vegan wing sauce at home all of the time, It's very easy.   I ended up eating it like a salad because the burrito fell apart. I dumped the contents out, drizzled the ranch, and embraced it as a salad. Their sunflower seed ranch is the bomb! I'm very impressed with how much it tastes like ranch despite being vegan.   I've read other reviews and it seems like the trick around the slow service is to order at the bar and then sit down.  I really hope they open up a Scottsdale or Phoenix location as long as they improve upon their service.",

But they will add eggs and cheese to some dishes upon request, making them vegetarian. My go to breakfast order is the wild western breakfast tacos, which I order with eggs and cheese (vegetarian but not vegan). Some of their portions are on the smaller size, but the breakfast tacos are actually huge and I never leave hungry when I order them. It's pricy when you consider there is no meat being served, but I figure the organic, locally sourced ingredients cause the higher price point. I have never been here for lunch/dinner; I'm going to need to try it out one of these days!",

Tables outside as well as lots of seating inside.   My honey and I got the BBQ jackfruit Mac n cheese and the Harvest burrito. The Harvest burrito donates $1 of purchase to wildlife which is the reason we decided to get it.  The jack fruit was delicious! My omnivore boyfriend was dumbfounded how yummy it was (mostly the fact jackfruit taste exactly like pulled pork).  The Harvest burrito was a miss, we were both pretty disappointed. The quinoa overtook the whole burrito instead of adding to it.   We came on a Saturday night and the service was pretty slow, but the servers seem like they all help each other out so no one has to wait too long.   Over all super cute! Like any other vegan and/or locally sourced place your dollar won't stretch far. Burrito, Mac n cheese, a shake and two desserts was $50 not including tip. $$  Side note: I got the Snikkers bar, but don't let it fool you the description is that of an Almond Joy bar! I did not read the description and fully expected something of that similar to a known Snickers bar. Nevertheless it was yummy!",

He walked right in and asked if they had gluten free food (he's 6) and the staff was so friendly and inviting to him. They didn't seem annoyed with him at all for asking if everything (item by item) was gluten free. We ordered the Mac and cheese for him and the nachos to share and I had the mushroom burger. It was all tasty! The nachos were pretty spicy, their jalapenos are no joke! I love that they're 98% organic and vegan. They're also a socially conscious business!

    "text": "I love the concept of Pomegranate Cafe.   It's a vegetarian restaurant that promotes healthy and clean eating. They have lots of gluten free options or gluten free substitutes, so it might be a good place to go to for people who have allergy concerns. They serve lots of organic and local produce, and have cute hip decorations. The water that they served had cucumbers in it and came in little mason jars, so yeah, trendy. It was quite busy even on a Friday afternoon, which shows that many people enjoy coming to Pomegranate Cafe.   I had the breakfast burrito some time ago, and I liked it a lot. This time, I ordered the protein bowl, which was great. I loved the scoop of pesto-macadamia-avocado topping on top of the eggs. To be honest, I feel like I might have been able to make the protein bowl on my own with lots and lots of great veggies and eggs, but I appreciated that the cafe served dishes where people could could decipher what was in their food. My mom got the Athena wrap, which she liked, and my sister got the Kung Pao Burrito; she was sweating by the time she ate half of her burrito because it was spicy.   The only downside about this restaurant was the price; it was a lot pricier than I expected it to be. To be fair, there were lots of organic produce that went into creating the dishes, so I can tell why the prices were higher. I would go more often if the prices weren't so high; overall, I would give this place 4.5 stars if possible but rounded up because of the amount of thought that must have gone to making healthy foods tasty.   Bottom line: Trendy and hip vegetarian restaurant that promotes clean eating... with flavor. Highly recommended.",

I don't care if this place supports a specific candidate or even had a political candidate to come and speak. I think it's great! Getting involved with the local community is the best thing a business can do. It lets people know hat they actually care. I would like to tell everyone to please try the cafe out and see for yourself why it's a great place that includes EVERYONE, and not just a few. Thanks for standing up for what's right and having excellent service too!!",

Everything on the menu is vegan by default and if you want dairy, you have to request it! the menu is pretty sizeable and includes everything from french toast for breakfast to some sweet treats for dessert! I had the Chick-un wrap which comes with a vegan aioli and some really delicious marinated kale, avocado, and a bunch of other yummy stuff. For dessert I gave their cheesecake a try, which was....eh. I also had their version of an almond joy which was awesome! They also have some pretty delcious looking cookies. The service was good and I'll definitely be back.",

The desserts are out of this world & there are many gluten free options. Also very friendly servers. You can't go wrong eating here but it's a small place so don't be in a big hurry because they can get backed up & very busy. Just enjoy the cute surroundings & friendly people. Outside seating when the weather permits, alcohol, happy hours, amazing coffee drinks & weekend brunches- what more could you want?",

We had a chocolate-strawberry cinnamon roll that was really hard and flavorless, the brownie was also really hard and strong-like dark chocolate.  The cheesecake was decent but still flavorless, although it reminded of ice cream almost.  Totally a waste of $26 for the 4 items we purchased.  I should've spent that much on gas to travel to a different bakery (say, the one in PHX......).  So disappointed.  Maybe I should've gone for the food instead of the desserts and I might have had a different outcome, but at this point, I'm not going out of my way to try this place again.",

The veggies are fresh and delicious, and I love the hummus.  I've also ordered some of the rice and tofu and was impressed, although it could have been a bit more spicy.  I've ordered the hummus with bagel that also comes with veggie chips - very filling and tasty.  I need to branch out and order more things the next times I visit.  One of my friends is picky and vegan, and she now frequents this place quite often.  I recently ordered a salad with kale, and whatever the dressing that was on the kale was the most delicious dressing I have tasted in a while!  I have also ordered a veggie wrap with the \"cheese\" made from nuts (I think).  It was deliciously flavorful and interesting. The flax crackers that came with it weren't really enough, maybe 25 kcal worth. I also have tried their sweet stuff, and the homemade granola bars and cheesecake bites are fresh and tasty.   The staff members are always friendly and happy to chat for a few minutes when picking up orders or trays.   There are a few things that could make the place even better.  If it's busy, be prepared to wait for a while for the food.  Sometimes the portions are big and then sometimes they are small. I was expecting a deliciously large veggie plate like last time (normal size plate) but instead got a cake-sized plate with maybe 1/2 cup veggies  and hummus.  Also, some items are pre-mixed, and peppers make me rather sick. I have to pick them out or order something else.  Sometimes, or often, things are forgotten in an order, so make sure to check before leaving.   Pomengranate has expanded the menu since my review in August or whenever, and they now have dinner. I noticed on Facebook that they have pet happy hour, which is cool for people who have dogs.",

So far everything I have eaten there is absolutely delicious (and I'm not a vegetarian). Their pastries, smoothies, and juices are great, and today I just tried their daily quesadilla...wow!  Cons: As you will see from other reviews, it is very pricey. My quesadilla and a slice of cake was $21 (no beverage included). The other problem is that the wait can be annoying. I typically wait about 10 minutes just for a fresh juice, and yet today I ordered the quesadilla and it was ready in 5 minutes. Maybe it is a sign they are working out the kinks. I wish this place would provide waiter service and use the counter only for takeout orders. That would really speed up the process overall.  Great, local, organic, amazing!",

But the sandwich was fantastic.  I thought about it the rest of the day.  The Arizona Roll is another great item.  It's Nori seaweed stuffed with almond spread and a mix of vegetables.  The almond spread is especially delicious.  The roll is served like sushi, with soy sauce and wasabi.  The loose leafs teas here are really good too, as are the fresh juices.",

I don't know how good the food is, but most of the people who came seem to like it.

They were soooo good, I would have never thought to use walnuts as meat substitute, brilliant! The burger was another big winner! It had a jalapeno curry sauce that was so flavorful, and it paired nicely with the sweet potato and avocado. On the side were yummy baked fries with homemade barbeque sauce... still licking my lips!  I'll definitely be back, again, and again, and AGAIN!",

We got the biscuits and gravy, and the chilaquiles, both with tofu and some leftovers for later. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the service wasn't the best...we weren't checked on - so we didn't get water refills (sitting outside in Arizona), we didn't order drinks or desserts because by the time he came back, we didn't feel like waiting any longer. I watched the two tables next to us get waited on hand and foot by their server! She was coming back and forth so much! We spent an hour there and i can confidently say 20 minutes of that at the least, was sitting and waiting for our waiter to come back and let us box up our food and leave. Some more water would've been nice too. Oh and the smoothie and juice we wanted but didn't get because it would've been another 20 minutes waiting for our server, who's name was Danny.",

It's a bit on the pricey side for veggie fare, but I just tell myself I'm back in Los Angeles and get to enjoying my iced Pom milk latte with my $14 breakfast bowl. The coffee is really great, especially when it includes their house blended non-dairy milk. I tend to like the breakfast options more than lunch, the Pom Muffin, bowls, and scrambles always well cooked and tasty. For lunch, the nachos....are not good so avoid those, and get one of the salads, bowls, or sandwiches instead. Service can be a tad spastic, and you do have the sense that the regulars get way better service post-yoga class than any newbies in town. They have a lovely pastry/dessert case up front, too, so grab a gluten free power bar, a cup of coffee, and get prepared to eavesdrop on people extolling the virtues of hot yoga and wheat grass.",

The fries were served with a homemade BBQ sauce which we bought a jar of.  We naturally tried some sweets after we ate. The cowgirl cookies were wonderful!

I ordered a breakfast plate from their board (no price listed) and a pomegranate tea - was surprised at a $22 bill.   Now, I'm not vegetarian so my perspective comes from a \"likes to be healthy\" meat eater. Eggs were good. Veggie bacon wasn't for me because I really like the real stuff but I think vegetarians would love it. Pancake special was tasty with fruit, sprinkle of chocolate  and nuts in it. Pomegranate tea was only okay and apparently cost $4-$5. Service was minor - very little interaction with those of us sitting at the bar. Decor was cute.   Overall - I'm glad it's here for all my vegan/vegetarian friends but would only come back with them. The price was just too high for my simple breakfast needs.",

    "text": "FINALLY, The Funk has come back to South Phoenix.  Have you ever done something one day and was more upset the next day about what you did? Well that's how I feel about dropping $45 on Pomegranate cafe for a late veggie lunch - solo. (I can imagine the heads shaking from all the carnivores. That's steak money, right?)   Yeah, I feel ya'. My support for veggie eateries is quickly waning. They are over-priced and can be quite pretentious with the creativity.  So, I was down south on a hot afternoon and really worked up a sweat. I remembered reading that Pomegranate Cafe sold fresh juice and was located somewhere near 40th St and Chandler Blvd. Had I known to look for the shopping center with Safeway and two doors down from Trader Joes....Landmarks, folks! Very important when giving directions....   PC's white and pink sign is a tad dull against the building. If I wasn't specifically looking for the cafe, I probably would have missed it and gone somewhere else to eat. But anyway, I walked in, grabbed all the menus (regular, HH, and juice bar), and had a seat. (Only order at the counter if you want take-away).   Asked for a juice right away and despite the \"slow service\" comments that other reviewers have posted, I wasn't too bothered by the several minutes it took for juice to make its way to my table. I pushed aside water and guzzled it down. Aahhh. I could feel, see, hear, smell, sense, taste, perceive the essence of life coursing through my veins. That must be the feeling Popeye gets  after eating spinach (mmmm, love those greens).  Why only three stars for PC? One for just being veggie + One for being freshly made + One for serving fresh juice   Fresh juice was the best part of my afternoon. I wasn't too impressed with the food. I ordered off the regular menu like an idiot and hit myself later for not giving the happy hour menu a chance. Could've saved myself half the price.   Truth be told - I should've stopped with the juice, paid the bill, and walked away. But, ooh, I spied with my little eye jackfruit tacos and jackfruit sliders.   - BBQ jackfruit sliders (3) for $12: jackfruit, peppers, onions, jalapeno cabbage slaw, chimichurri on bun.  Even though I asked for the BBQ sauce on the side, the jackfruit itself had a sickly sweetness that cancelled my enjoyment. What I really liked, though, were the silver dollar-sized buns.   - Jamaican jerk street tacos (3) for $12: jerk seasoned jackfruit, cabbage slaw, pico, baja sauce, chimichurri on corn tortillas.  Did that say jamaican? Show me the jerk who thought of that because wurnt no part of those tacos Jamaican. Spicy? Nope. All I could taste was that sickly sweet jackfruit. Created and tasted exactly like the sliders.    The jackfruit wasn't prepared the way I'm used to having it. In fact I couldn't even tell that it was jackfruit by sight because it was mixed with other stuff and only one spoonful of it was buried under the mounds of cabbage slaw and sauce.  When I mentioned the sweetness to the two staff members who checked on me they blamed the jackfruit. Really? I know what jackfruit tastes like. Even when fresh it's not overly sweet. Either this jackfruit was sweetened and then packaged, or one of PC's sauces used in the dishes was too sweet. Won't order it again.   - For dezzert, a slice of tropical cake. Good cake, real cake, but could have used more tropics and less sugary lemon frosting. AGAIN with the sweetness.  Overall, PC's dishes are very colourful and look beautiful. I'll try a wrap and/or salad next time, but I won't go out of my way to eat there again any time soon.  Four items averaged to about $10 apiece, then tax and probably a surcharge for a take out box.  You would think that would have filled me up, but actually I stopped somewhere else on the way back to central Phoenix.",

We heard great things about pomegranate cafe and so we made the drive out here. We got two coffees, a hummus side, the green goddess, and the green bandito as a bowl. My entree was the green goddess and it literally tasted like nothing while the potatoes were very very cold. My friends food literally tasted like a baby ate Mexican food and then threw it up onto a plate and that's how it was presented to us along with taste. Her food was mild on spice but had absolutely no flavor. I had to ask for salt and pepper for my food, but even then was only able to force down half of my burger because I covered in so much hummus for it to actually taste like anything. My friend ate maybe two bites of her food when I left over half of my food on my plate still hence our plates still had almost all of our food on it.The server was a Indian girl who asked us if we wanted boxes for the rest of our food and I said no because we didn't like it. She did nothing to try and make it better or right, and didn't offer to have it remade or anything. I paid $45.07 for food that I literally wasn't able to eat.   The reason why I'm posting this review however is just to warn others. Go to Pita Jungle or Green to eat vegan, the food actually has flavor and is a lot better priced. The servers will actually take care of you and the experience will be better.",

Carrots and purple cabbage brought the crunch while the soft curry bathed rice and tofu almost melted in my mouth.   The enchilada style burrito supreme tantalized my tastebuds. Each ingredient playfully danced in unison among the authentic Mexican spices.   Last, but definitely not least, the country mushroom soup. Quinoa, corn, onion and vegetable broth were tied up perfectly with the mushrooms. I was never a fan of the fungus, until now. I've rescinded my hatred and replaced it with love.   Pomegranate Cafe, we will be back. I'll be longing to try other items on the menu until we meet again.",

My only complaint is the cafe isn't anywhere remotely convenient for us but that's not their fault. Given the 8pm closing time, the hours are a little less-than-convenient but again, if we lived closer this probably wouldn't pose a problem. Please open a location closer to Central Phoenix!",

    "text": "A friend of mine recently told me about Pomegranate Cafe in Ahwatukee. I didn't know that all their menu items are vegan---how cool is that? All the baked goods and menu items are vegan, but they do offer eggs (instead of tofu for breakfast/brunch items) and dairy cheese (instead of vegan Diaya cheese) to appeal to vegetarians.   We went for a late afternoon lunch today and ordered pomegranate iced green tea, roasted red pepper hummus platter, and tempeh BLT sandwiches. The tea was tart and naturally sweet; very refreshing. The hummus was tasty and served with vegetables and warm bread slices. The BLT was simply awesome. I have to learn how to get my tempeh to taste like theirs! The baked goods looked way too good to pass up. So, against my waistlines wishes, we got 2 slices of vegan cake (lemon with strawberry frosting), raw vegan donut holes and coconut macaroons to take home. I will say that the donut holes don't actually taste like donuts, but they were still delicious. The cake was so amazing that I muttered to my husband that we need to order a whole cake (I'll have to see if they offer whole cakes...it was like wedding cake-good). I wish I could have tried everything on the menu...I just have to make plans to visit often. The berry pepita french toast sounds absolutely divine...for next time.",

We went a couple of months back for a simple breakfast I had coffee that was cold that I sent back twice and I ordered a simple over easy egg with their grain toast anyway It came out to over $20. I had asked for a slice of tomato lettuce and some onions --I was up charged for the slices, onion &  lettuce. Also used to have a delightful kale salad but the last time I ordered it the portion was small and it was mixed with other random lettuces anyway it was very expensive and disappointing at best. It does not have to cost a fortune to be organic and healthy --not sure how this place does so well.",

Needless to say I have brought many friends/family/carnivores here and NOT ONE of them was disappointed.",

I enjoy the atmosphere, there are a lot of people who tend to be at the Pomegranate so it's always very lively.  Of course, with so many people there also tends to be a long line. This is probably the one thing I hate about this place. Sometimes it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour just to get an order placed and find a seat, and that's not even going into how long it takes to actually get your food.  Overall, the place is good, the food is good, but unless you get there early or don't mind waiting in line, it may be best if you avoid this place.",

I went here for breakfast and ordered the Pina Colada Pancakes not knowing everything was vegan (which is a plus in my book). The pineapple compote was warm and not too sweet, dusted with coconut. I liked the food here so much I came back the next day for lunch and had a curried sweet potato/tempeh bacon and tofu sammy on GF bread with a carrot ginger juice. YUM!  Next time I'll be in to sample some of the raw vegan brownie/powerbar/ball/tirimisu/cheesecake desserts!  I would eat here everyday, but I think this ma + daughter place will burn a hole in my pocketbook! It's a little pricey, but it's so good it's worth it to put some real nutritious food in your body.
