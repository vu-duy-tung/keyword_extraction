    "text": "The food was mediocre at best. I can cook soul food, who am I kidding, ANY FOOD very well, but I didn't feel like cooking tonight and yelp had a 10 for 20 deal and they had 4 stars. I go in, it's a small restaurant, decor isn't anything...  My niece warned me prior to ordering not to order the fish, it's battered like a fish stick so I stayed away from that. I ordered for me my son and my niece, with my second order I didn't want all dark meat so I order a breast instead of the thigh. When we got our orders, he mixed up which meal I wanted the change made to. That's ok, it happens- he then proceeded with, \"that's not what you said you wanted\". That to me was rude, I had my niece and son there to verify, then he told me after waiting 25 mins that it would be another 15 mins to fix it. My son is seven, that's not going to work. So I looked at the food, he placed greens in one plate with chicken and cabbage in another plate with the chicken. I'm not sure if he was trying to save money on plates and dishes but then our chicken was soggy by the time we got home...womp womp womp. And the sweet tea, it has to be a powdery drink mix...   Overall, the food was edible but nothing spectacular and the customer service was subpar. I will not drive that way for soul food again.",

Most of the reviews were good so i was pretty excited.  I also saw the $10 for $20 deal so i thought, perfect!   When i walked in, this place looked like a small family place. Which is nice since most of small food joints like his has the best food!   I showed the guy at the counter the coupon from yelp...he asked me why i bought it? And told me why i gave money to yelp instead of giving it to him...haha. Why offer coupons if you dont want people to use it?  This made me feel uncomfortable...  I ordered the chicken with the baked macaroni and cole slaw.  I must say the chicken and the corn bread was really good, but the sides were pretty bland. If i do come back here again, ill probably skip the sides.",

It was crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside. I also had the Green beans which were awesome as well as the Mac and cheese. I want crazy about the Mac and cheese but everything else was unbelievable! The portions, even their desserts are much larger than normal.  The staff was the family who own the restaurant. They're very cordial and helpful as well as good cooks! They really appreciate your business. They don't take it for granted as many others do. It's not going to be my last trip here. I can't wait to try their chicken as well as ribs!",

All the sides I have tried, of things I like, were very good. The green beans have a different flavor that will make you never want normal green beans again. I never really liked potato salad but they converted me with theirs. Sweet potato side, is a desert in itself. I am a fan of cornbread and this stuff is great. all they need is really good cream butter and the cornbread could be all you would want to eat. Nice family restaurant, where they truly want to make sure you are happy.",

They're smiles are as big as their portions. You'll fall in love with the fried chicken and some nights I lay awake thinking about it. Yes, you can't have it all the time but its worth the cheat every now and then.   The atmosphere is pretty plain here but the food more than makes up for it. Drink selection is sparse but plenty of items on the menu to fill you up. I recommend the Fried Chicken, Potato Salad, Collards, Mac and Cheese.

We both selected the macaroni and cheese, along with the purple kool aid to go along with it. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and perfectly fried, albeit the pieces were kind of small. The macaroni and cheese was disappointing, it was very oily and didn't have any cream or sauce to pull it together. All in all, it was a good meal but not sure I'd go out of my way to get here.",

The chicken breast was perfectly cooked, crispy outside and so juicy inside. The owners' experience shows in how well everything was prepared and in the way the flavors worked so well together. Even the hot sauce was a perfect compliment to the flavor of the chicken. The portion sizes were generous too.

The cornbread is to die for...perfect sweetness and no embedded chunks of foreign veggies!  Everything was deliciously hot still when I opened them at home and I was very impressed as I suspected I might be after seeing them profiled on a local restaurant review TV show a few months back. In fact the chicken, in my opinion, should cool to almost room temp. before enjoying- batter coating delicious and not disguised with pepper.  French fries, boxed separately, were still crispy/moist and not oversalted.  I'll leave you with this:  The green beans are the best!  Sweet, salty, cooked to hell and flavorful!  I'm going back soon for another helping and some dessert too.",

Those who've read my other reviews know that I'm a sucker for soul food and every so often...I must have some YARD BIRD in my life!! I was in Arizona for a friend's retirement...I flew into Phoenix but stayed in Tuscon (yes...I did....it was cheaper...significantly cheaper).  On my departure date...I checked out of the hotel at 12 and my flight leaving PHX was not until later. It's less than a 2hour drive from Tucson to Phoenix....so I would have some time to kill...I immediately thought of finding some fried chicken for lunch! So, I Yelped my way to Ezekiel's. It's a small mom-n-pop joint close to I-10.  I walked in....it was empty. Two gentlemen were sitting and talking (not eating)....I got the impression one (if not both) was affiliated with the restaurant in some professional way. There was a young lady behind the counter....totally immersed in her iPhone. I ordered a 2 piece fried chicken meal (added a 3rd piece...because...well..I'm greedy) with collard greens, potato salad and corn bread. This is where Ezekiel's lost a star from me...I sat at a nearby table and waited.....and waited....and waited. While I waited several folks came in and picked up their call-in orders (I assume). The young lady served them their to-go packages and went back to her iPhone business. The two gentlemen remained immersed in their private conversation. I was getting a little perturbed but honestly...I had plenty of time to kill so I continued to wait. Ultimately though (after 14 minutes), when my food finally came out...it was damn good. I'm a self-proclaimed Yard Bird aficionado so I am qualified to say that Ezekiel's fried chicken is delicious!! The greens were just okay (not seasoned enough for my liking) but the potato salad and cornbread were both good as well. The chicken was piping hot too. So I assumed it was fresh out the grease which could have attributed to the delay. I'm not gonna say it was worth the LONG wait...but it was indeed some yummy chicken.   PROS: Delicious fried chicken!!  CONS:  The wait was brutal. THE PLACE WAS EMPTY!!!!! I felt abandoned. Lol.   RECOMMENDATION: Yes! Delicious Fried Chicken.   SIDE NOTE: Arizona is hot as hell.....I mean....literally........Arizona is as HOT AS THE DEVIL'S PRIMARY RESIDENCE!! Don't give me that \"it's a dry heat\" crap either. I live in South Texas.....I know hot weather. The sun is aimed directly at the state of Arizona.....HOT!!!!",

    "text": "This is how good the fried chicken at Ezekiel's is......  I don't even care for fried chicken that much in general. I would say in the past 10 years Ive had fried chicken maybe 4 times including one time at Lo Lo's. Fried chicken doesn't excite me at all, even at places like Lo Lo's where it is definitely pretty decent fried chicken, I never had any desire whatsoever to go back.  Now with that said...the fact that I don't even like fried chicken that much in general...I can unequivocally say that Ezekiels fried chicken is one of the best meals I've ever had in my life. I literally plan like a week ahead for when I'm going to go out of my way and go get my next fix of fried chicken. I'm a huge foodie and love eating at all different sorts of places...burgers....pizza....tacos....steak....BBQ....and its like these other restaurants offering other good food in Phoenix don't even exist to me anymore.  I don't know how anyone eating here can give this place less than 4 stars. They must have done so much meth that they can't even taste straight anymore, because the chicken is absolutely outstanding. In fact, the people who give this place less than 4 stars should all be rounded up and shipped off to the Hawaiian island of Molokai like they did with all the people who had leprosy decades ago....except the new colony will be for morons!",

Service I give a five the gentlemen in the front is a sweet man very friendly and personable.  After my order was placed I took a seat watched some tv and my food was out. Now everything was hot and fresh. I began with my fried catfish, perfectly seasoned, light and flakey. No hot sauce was needed but it was great with or without. Sweet potatoes were perfect and the mac&cheese was creamy. I got an extra side of cabbage and greens mixed, which were good as well. Free refills( I had the half&half) and found myself addicted to the concoction. Overall my taste buds had been craving good soul food in Phoenix. This place hit the spot and I will be back very soon. I have been to LoLo's and Mrs.Whites, this place knocks those out the water, period.",

The cole slaw looked good on my wife's plate, but she ate it before I had a chance to grab a forkful.   Small place,  but homey. I'm assuming Ezekiel himself welcomed us and treated us great.

The place is pretty bare bones inside. Counter service and they call your name when the food is ready. We both had fried chicken and thought it was very good. Be warned that it takes a good 15 minutes but that is because they make the chicken fresh. You can tell because it is rocket hot when you get it. I also had collard greens which had a little sweetness to them which I had not had before. Tasty, but I do like it without sweetness so I can go nuts with the hot pepper vinegar. The Mac and cheese I bet is outstanding right from the oven. This was unfortunately a little clumpy but again you could tell that it was homemade.  We did not try the desserts, but I am sure we will be back. The folks behind the counter were very friendly and I think the prices are quite reasonable.  I thought it was a little unprofessional for the girl at the counter to be sitting and reading or texting. I would think there is something more that she could do, or at least check on the guests to see how they are doing.  All in all, I was pleased. This is probably not quite as good as lo lo's but it is cheaper, closer and there is no long wait to be seated. I hope they do well here.",

The catfish was the toughest fish I have ever tried to eat.  The thinner parts of the it were so hard I could not eat at all.  The fried chicken was super dry.  I dont know why they served it to us because it was visibly overcooked.  The marshmallows that I'm assuming were meant for the sweet potatoes were melted on the bun for my catfish sandwich.  The gentleman behind the counter was friendly but nothing was brought to our table.  Which seemed a little strange considering I need to use a cane to walk and I was there with an elderly parent- so to have us keep getting up to come to the counter to get the sodas he forgot to give us, then the chicken which came out later, then sauces.  We took our leftovers with us (which there were a lot of) but we just threw it away somewhere else because we were embarassed that none of us liked it and felt bad throwing it all away in front of them.  Seeing all the good reviews on here I might go try it again.  I really like to support locally owned business.  But it was really bad food even though we wanted to like it.",

So this past Saturday, I was finally able to go there and I ordered the Fried Chicken Lunch meal with 3 sides (mac & cheese, greens and sweet potatoes) and needless to say, I was beyond dissapointed. The greens taste like sugar, the mac & cheese was just the mac (not cheesy at all) and the sweet potatoes were a mush of burnt sweet potatoes with a pound of nutmeg on top. The fried chicken was ok but definitely not what I am used too. I would prefer Albertson's chicken over Ezekiel's anyday. The best part of the meal was the sprite that helped wash down the dissapointment. I should of read between the lines when I walked in and the place was empty.  It's back to the drawing board for me. I think it is safe to say that AZ is definitely slacking in the food department.",

For sides we tried the greens, sweet potatoes, Mac n cheese and macaroni salad.  My husband loved the greens, I loved the sweet potatoes.    The family that owns it are so nice and helpful, my daughter thought the woman at the front was great.  It took a while to get the food.   You can order ahead or they do local delivery.  Like the other reviews said, it is not fancy, just down home cooking.     Can't wait to try the desert, people came in just for the banana cake and the triple chocolate cake.",

The amount of chicken was HUGE and there was plently to take home for left over.   Bottom line, the fried chicken is fantastic.

The restaurant service seemed in disarray, the staff were perhaps too relaxed and hanging about being loud and were not wearing hairnets or hats. Nor were the kitchen staff inside.When we got around to eating the portion sizes were good. I had the fried chicken dinner. Within moments of cutting in I found a hair. it was really gross and off putting. My husband also ordered the chicken and in all fairness it tasted good. The sides on the other hand needs improvement. We also ordered the fried catfish sandwich, which was good although you had to apply your own condiments and did not include any \"sauce\". The cornbread was also good  So in a nutshell if you enjoy catfish sandwiches, fried chicken and cornbread this is the place to go to.",

NO flavor, wasn't crispy, greens were plain, sweet potatoes mech,  Talapia, nasty. I'm trying to NOT be so negative. It just wasn't GOOD. 3mos later, After they've been open a few months. Decided, maybe I wasn't fair. And maybe it just wasn't a good day, that first time. SO, gave them 1 more chance....got the chicken meal. Chicken breast, tasted like it had just come out of the freezer And HADN'T thawed all the way before they fried it. It was tough, NOT crispy. It did NOT taste good. Told my fam, that I had picked it up for dinner.  They asked me why? You don't like us? I said,  come on. Let's give it another chance. They went to McDonald's. The chicken is still in the kitchen.",

Catfish was so bland (least they could have done was simply add some salt to it!). Sides were also not up to par. I had the potato salad and mac & cheese and both were way too sweet! If I wanted something sweet, I would have ordered dessert. I would not recommend this place nor would I ever go back to this place. They might want to consider serving some humble pie because they talk so highly of their food but it's nothing they should be proud of.

Or most elsewhere, really.  When I tell you that if you pick their ribs up by the bone, the meat actually falls off, I mean exactly that. Melt-in-your-mouth, perfectly BBQ'd ribs.   Baked macaroni tastes like it does when my Grandma makes it, which is damn near impossible to do. I'm sure there are people with the same level of skill, but Ezekiel's provides me with that nostalgia that others fall short of.  Their greens are perfectly cooked - they still have that satisfying crunch but they have this velvety texture to them also that is done exactly the way greens should be done.   The people who own & operate the restaurant are as nice as the food is good. This place is a good example of what people mean when they invoke the term southern hospitality. You come in, people are happy to see you, their interactions with you are warm and welcoming rather than robotic and monotonous, and then they give you this place of food that must be what happiness tastes like.   I'm planning on moving in about 18 months and I will come back to Phoenix just to eat here.",

    "text": "The decor was.... wow. I am all for reusing perfectly usable furniture but just rolling some interior house paint over it doesn't really appeal to me. Some of the seating was difficult to use because the tables are so close together. It is apparent the restaurant is family run and the patrons love to go there.   The owner was very friendly to everyone. It was a very busy Saturday evening. It was actually very chaotic. I felt like I never got the full attention of the cashier, but everyone seemed to be happy to be there. There were a lot of regular customers there. They could have used additional help.   I felt like I received a large portion of food. I ordered 2 piece white chicken ($11.99) and 2 piece catfish ($10.99) dinners. Each came with two sides and cornbread. In addition I decided to add one crab cake on the side just to try it out. I was quite shocked when my one side crab cake cost $8.99! I cold have gotten the crab cake combo for $10.99 and it included one side and a drink. Overall I spent $38 on dinner.   I loved the macaroni and cheese, sweet potatoes and cornbread. I would consider going there again for those. The other two sides were collared greens and mashed potatoes. They were average. I personally felt my chicken was a bit over cooked and dry. The crab cake was good but not $8.99 good. The catfish was huge and flakey.   Overall I did not have a bad experience, but I would not go out of my way to return.",

Ordered up 2 pieces of chicken and fried catfish. Got the baked man and cheese and green beans as the sides.    The mac and cheese was only so so for me, the green beans were awesome!    The fried catfish was really good, the cornbread crust was light and crispy. Fish was cooked perfectly. Seasoning was excellent!  The fried chicken was awesome as well. I'm not sure it was the best I've had ever but it definitely ranks in my top 5. The seasoning and coating was awesome. Chicken was fried perfectly.  Juicy and tasty!    Both the chicken and fish were so good I totally forgot about adding the hot sauce!",

The menus have lots of choices and combos to choose from at reasonable prices. I ordered a 2 pieces of dark meat chicken (leg & breast). It was super tender and juicy. I don't remember the last time I had fried chicken this good. My meal also comes with corn bread and two sides and I choose sweet potatoes and claw. They both both equally delicious. The corn bread was soft , fluffy and buttery. My friends and I enjoyed our meals. We had good laughs with the regulars as well as the owner. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves soul food.",

I have brought lots of folks here after I tried their fried chicken and they all agree this is the best.  Forget about LoLo's or Mrs White.  Forget about Church's, Popeye's or even Louisana Fried Chicken.  They do not have the kind of crispy, crunchy on the outside, moist juicy on the inside that this place has.  The cook is the husband and the lady in front is his wife.  Sometimes their daughter takes orders too.  I like their service very much, they try to answer any questions you have and make very good suggestions on what to order.  In spite of being here many times, I have always ended up ordering fried chicken as I would bring someone new each time and we end up doing the 8 or 12 piece, and have not once been disappointed.  I do have to say that you might want to call ahead before you head over there and order.  even if you are eating in. :)  That is how their chicken taste so good, they do not have a heat lamp like you see at church's or kfc where the chicken gets dried up.  they only cook it when u order it :)  so don't give them a one star cause their food makes u wait and u get all angry and unhappy and have the bitter taste of bile in your mouth ruining your taste ;)  so enjoy it and check out their carrot cake, its not too sweet and very delicious and a good end to your meal of yum yum chicken !",

Brings me to my next reason. Fresh and made to order. Granted it's probably not healthy to eat it everyday but I feel I can justify it because you know the ingredients are fresh. Customer service was good too. This place isn't really big on the presentation so your good will come in a sectioned styrofoam box but you won't care about that. One thing I wasn't impressed with was the pie crust though. It was hard and not easily broken apart. Other than that this place was on point.",

The fried chicken was delicious--not too oily or heavily breaded--and the corn bread....to die for!! Wish there was some jalapeno in it, but they probably don't do that to cater to the bigger population.

No. However I'd definitely come back at some point. Here are the pros and cons  Pros:  Mac and cheese Fried Chicken (overall good but needs some seasoning..kinda bland) The folks (just nice people) Sweet Potato Pie  The cons:  The place is filthy. Cobwebs etc all over, dirty floors and tables  Lack of spice in chicken  Catfish was real plain and had no real flavor either  Pricey. $25 for an 8 piece with a couple sides  This is a good option if you are in this part of town and need soul food and don't want to drive all the way to Lo Lo's. I have to give Lolo the edge in the flavor dept however.   If these guys would add a tiny bit of Cayenne and garlic and maybe a little salt to their batter it would be the best in town.",

    "text": "Had seen this place on Check Please so decided to try it on my birthday. I'm glad my boyfriend and I did. The customer service was good and the food was even more amazing. I was a little iffy about trying soul food  because it is hard to fine when you're not in the south but this place sure proved me wrong. The wait was a little long but it was worth it and don't let the decor fool you. I got the two piece chicken,collard greens, and sweet potatoes. The chicken was juicy and the skin was crispy which I was surprised because it's hard to find when it comes to white meat. The collard greens were seasoned just right and the sweet potatoes... can you get me a big bucket of it please. My boyfriend had the green beans on the side and those were amazing as well. We tasted a little hint of sweetness and vinaigrette of some sort, it was different but in a good way. Would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for good soul food.",

    "text": "The reviews on this place was spot on.  Good food and friendly people.  Used the Yelp app to find a place for dinner near our hotel and this was top of the list.  My son just got his braces so he was all for mash potatoes and baked mac and cheese.  We get greeted when we walk in and asked if we been here before.  We say no and get a quick breakdown of the menu.  We decide on 2 catfish dinner combos, 1 chicken dinner combo and a kids plate.  Cool thing is they have a sign that says food is made to order so it may take up to 20 mins.  I am cool with that especially when they have the warning.  Food comes out piping hot.  If you can be patient let it cool down or dig into the cornbread or sides.  We got green beans, baked mac n cheese, mash potatoes with gravy, and potato salad.  All of them good but the potato salad and the baked mac n cheese were my favorites.  So tasty.  I think I would be good with just those 2 sides.  Once I could hold onto the chicken and fish, I dug right in.  The catfish fillets were huge and covered with breading.  Crispy outside and very moist on the inside.  Very good.  Chicken is lightly breaded and perfectly golden.  Again moist and crispy.  I like the touch of pepper that is part of the coating.  I love my hot sauce so I had to put some Louisiana hot sauce on my chicken.  Mmmmmmmm.  We got there at 630pm and only ones there.  In the hour we were there, the phone was constantly off the hook and the place was half full by the time we left.    I get how people are giving grief about the decor but c'mon, it's a southern fried food restaurant.  It didn't bother me and the family.  This family owned restaurant is no joke.    Skip the regular fried chicken place and check these guys out.",

Every single table had crumbs on it and I could not even think of drinking anything out of the soda fountains because they just looked so dirty. The entire staff was completely unfriendly, I have never seen these women here before . I especially did not like how they treated two police detectives that came into eat. I was the 2nd person after the detectives came in and I almost finished eating my food before they finally got theirs. The staff was completely rude to me but they were even more rude to the detectives. The food this time was not great. It was definitely something I could make at home. Not been superior. The chicken was extremely salty and the sweet potatoes were not good at all. I will definitely be taking this off my list. That was my last time there.",

The cornmeal breading on the big hunk of fish is crispy, not greasy, about light to medium in thickness, well seasoned with salt, and the fish was very moist but still nice and flaky. Just...woah.  The above average sized fried chicken breast had a regular crunchy flour batter with a decent amount of seasoning. Parts were a little dry and it just became disappointing with the amazing catfish. I'll definitely go with dark neat next time.   The collard greens seemed to be steamed/boiled with carrots or it had some sugar added to it. A little too sweet for veggies for me. The mac n cheese had a pre crust crumbled on top but it was all a little more mushy and wet than I would like. The little piece of cornbread is sweet and really moist. More like a cake.  It's a little place in a strip mall with a few decorations of athlete paintings and pictures (Suns and Cardinals). The service is straight forward counter-order.",

Collard greens:  It was definitely cooked with something smoked, you can taste that---ham hock maybe.  But it was also a tinge sweet.  Never had greens sweet before. Not bad. Mashed potatoes & Gravy:  Potatoes were real and great--good buttery flavor.  You don't need gravy for it, but together it was really good.  Cornbread: On point.  Moist, good texture and perfect sweetness.  Oddly enough, the coleslaw was sweeter than the cornbread.   Mac & Cheese:  It was okay.  I preferred a little something crunchy just for texture.    Chicken:   My review of the chicken might have been better if I ate there.  Since I took it to go, the breading may have lost a little crispiness.  It was definitely good.  The skin was crispy, good seasoning and the meat was moist.    Great flavor for all items and definitely a place to try out.",

    "text": "These folks were recommended by another foodie, and this was my first visit with them. The owner is a big, happy gent, and didn't spare the conversation. I love that, when the owner/family is on-site and it's part of the experience. The wall to the east is adorned with family pics, and the west wall is covered with mostly historic photos. Definitely enough to keep your eyes busy while awaiting the goodness.  The hand-written menu is above the counter on chalkboard, and he pointed out the combo special to me. One piece each of catfish and fried-chicken(any piece) with two sides, cornbread and drink. Knowing the starch-load of the cornbread, I opted for both the seasoned cabbage and greens for my sides. He assured me they were both homemade. He also mentioned Kool-Aid as a drink option, and...so...you're damn right that's what I had to pour, LOL.  The whole combo came out great. Chicken thigh was just the right crispness and lightly seasoned. No batter, just spices. The fish was of course nicely covered in golden cornmeal batter, as God intended. There wasn't much seasoning that I could sense, making me reach for the Trappey's Louisiana sauce probably faster than I otherwise would. However, the right crunch, and moist inside.  The seasoned cabbage was whole leaf, huge pieces, not chopped or shredded up. The greens were not quite as leafy, LOL, and definitely had a hit of sugar which the owner confirmed for me. Both were yummy and needed nothing to enjoy. Cornbread was wrapped in plastic, but perhaps that's why it retained a good amount of moisture. It stood-up to buttering without falling to crumbles like so many recipes seem to do. I liked it.  At 12.99, the value for the dollar was there, with good company to chat with.  Now, the folks in Chandler and the Tuke who were making the drive further north into town have a much more convenient option.",

The menu has all your soulful favorites such as fried catfish, chicken, ribs, with delicious sides like Mac and cheese, collard greens, and cole slaw. Everything is made fresh from scratch, served with a friendly smile.   I had the fish and chicken combo ($10.99), which includes your choice of tilapia or catfish,  and any piece of chicken. I chose the catfish with breast and was fully satisfied. The catfish had a crunchy, crispy cornmeal crust with moist, tender, delectable catfish. The fried chicken was superbly seasoned and battered, with very tender meat. The combo includes 2 sides and a piece of cornbread. The collard greens were a warm embrace of tender, smoky, slightly sweet vegetables. The cole slaw was creamy, tangy, and tasted good (But not as good as those collard greens!).   The only little hiccup was that one person received mac and cheese as a side instead of baked beans. Since he ended up finishing the entire plate, I don't think he seemed to mind though.  :) Also, the food is made on the spot, which means it might take a little bit to get it out to you. But don't worry, it's well worth any wait, because they are infusing your food with a special little bit of heart and soul :)   The owners are incredibly nice and sweet. Definitely a great place to fill up on Southern eats.",

    "text": "This is another rare violation of my own personal policy of \"two visits before a stellar review.\" In this case, I must tell any and all readers that I have discovered the VERY BEST FRIED CHICKEN IN PHOENIX.  Ezekiel's is transplanted from York, Pennsylvania and it is our good fortune that they landed in Ahwatukee. A little short on ambiance (can you imagine old fashioned Formica topped luncheonette table ambiance) it really doesn't matter. Take it home; it seems everyone else is, based on the customers there on a Saturday evening taking theirs home.  Ezekiel's has managed to do with fried chicken what Lolo's, Mrs. Whites and others here in Phoenix just can't measure up to. The cooked to order Fried Chicken is served up golden crispy on the outside, yet still light, without that heavy batter so many insist on using and no oily taste whatsoever. Ezekiel's is doing it right and in my opinion, better than almost any others I have had, even better than the now world famous Willie Mae's Scotch House in New Orleans. In addition to that golden crust outside, each piece is tender and juicy on the inside. The breast portion is as big a chicken breast as you have even seen! The only drawback with that large a breast is that I found I ran out of \"crispy skin\" long before I was done with the luscious white meat. Absolutely flawless fried chicken and reasonably priced at 8 pieces for $10.99 (with two servings of cornbread) and 12 pieces for $13.99 (with three servings of cornbread). Price really doesn't make a difference, for fried chicken of this quality, I would pay more!  The normal \"sides\" you expect to find in a \"Soul Food Restaurant\" are here, with collard greens, fried cabbage, sweet potatoes, potato and macaroni salad, etc. My choice, based on the recommendation of the very nice lady who took my order (a daughter in this family owned establishment) was Baked Macaroni and Cheese and it did not disappoint.  I am going to find it hard to try their other specialties (Catfish, Tilapia, Ribs, Crab Cakes and Salmon Cakes) because I will NOT be able to resist the fried chicken. Maybe I will try the others for lunch.  Get there and when you do, chances are you will find me waiting for my next order of the VERY BEST FRIED CHICKEN IN PHOENIX!",

    "text": "Very disappointed.  My review comes from the perspective of both a former small business owner and as a consumer.    We are new to Phoenix and were looking for another place to add to our neighborhood haunts when I don't feel like cooking.  We got a coupon that read \"best fried chicken in Arizona.\"  I don't fry anything, and hubby was ready for some good fried chicken, so we went.  We walked in.  There were no other customers.  The greeting/welcome was non-existent.  The young woman at the counter would probably have preferred being somewhere else.  Turned out she is the owners' daughter.  We ordered at the counter then went to get a table.  The tables all had tell-tale signs of not being wiped down completely.  And I would refer to the ambience as spartan, though the paintings were interesting.  When the food came out, I was surprised that it was on styro to-go containers with plastic knives and forks.  I got the crab cakes (good but not great, $11.99 with 2 sides).  The sides were better than the crab cakes, but at $11.99, that some really expensive mac and slaw.  Hubby got the dark fried chicken ($8.99) and the same sides as I.  That's a lot to pay for two small pieces of dark meat, again making the mac and slaw pretty pricey.  The owner, who had been cooking, came out from the back toward the end of our experience and was quite congenial.  I hope his business makes it, but it won't be because the food is a good value for the price, nor because the customer service is good (it's virtually non-existent).    Bottomline for us:  For the $$, there should be clean tables, service staff coming to the table, and real plates and flatware.  Hubby said when he wants fried chicken again, he'll just go to Church's or KFC...  We won't return.",

    "text": "Oh gracious, what can I say!  Was in the mood for fried chicken and theirs is out of this world.  My husband who normally eats one breast and picks at the wings, ate 2 breasts, a leg, a thigh and a wing. It was chicken with breading, not breading with a little chicken like you get most places. I know someone said they were pricey but I don't think so for the \"quality\" you get.  The chicken was succulent and the breading was seasoned perfectly. My husband has been to Mrs. White's and says this chicken beats there hands down. Also, tried the slaw which had just enough sweetness and was not vinegary which meets my personal taste. I get my hair cut right next door to the place but this is the first time I tried it and I did it based on Yelp reviews.  Now I know what I will be bringing home every 6 weeks for dinner.  If I have any criticism, it would be their $5 delivery charge.  Between that and the tip, I paid an extra $9 over what it would have cost had I picked it up myself.  However, suck it up, last night it was worth it between the heat and how tired I was from work. We are only 2 1/2 miles away so from now on if I want it on a non-haircut night, I will go right from work before my body has a chance to say \"hallelujah, cool in here so relax - don't go out again.\"",

Pros: Hearty portions, ribs are fall off the bone tender, delectable cornbread, friendly staff, good location  Cons: The interior leaves much to be desired. It could use a good bit of TLC on the floors and walls, but I've come to expect that from mom and pop places.   Overall I liked the place. I'd even recommend it to others.

The chicken was ok but I cook better chicken. The mac-n-cheese was a mushy-gushy lump of grease with no flavor. However the sweet potatoes were good but they were cold. Overall big disappointment and I will never go back. Empty calories and waste of time",

    "text": "This review is based on my 2 very different experiences having Ezekiel's.  My first experience was carry out.  My boyfriend dined in and brought dinner home for me.  For us to share he ordered a Catfish dinner with sweet potatoes and mac and cheese, an extra side of greens, potato salad and mac & cheese (to go).  We realized they forgot the side of mac & cheese and included an extra side of potato salad instead.  No worries!  During the first visit the catfish was only so-so.  I didn't care for the breading, it wasn't very flavorful.  It was dry actually. Maybe because I didn't eat it fresh out of the grease.  I'm not sure but it was pretty dry.  The sweet potatoes were really good but sweet - borderline too sweet and had a texture of sweet potato pie filling. They didn't taste homemade either.  The mac & cheese wasn't even mentionable - too dry, not enough cheese and no flavor. The collard greens were seasoned with turkey necks (my favorite) but also taste sweet, as if they added sugar.  No worries - Where I'm from some people like their green sweet, some like them savory.  I'm a savory girl!  The potato salad saved the day.  It was mustard based with mayo - nice and Southern just how I like it.  Just like I make my own potato salad.  I rated my first taste of Ezekiel's with a 3 out of 5.  My second time trying Ezekiel's we dined in, on a Saturday afternoon.  This time I ordered the catfish dinner again with collard greens and sweet potatoes.  This time I LOVED the catfish.  It was served pippin' hot, fresh out of the grease.  When I ordered my food I asked for vinegar because I remembered the greens were sweet last time.  Vinegar gives sweet greens a nice balance.  I didn't need vinegar this time because the greens weren't sweet, they also didn't have any meat at all in them. No big deal!  The sweet potatoes this time were way too sweet and I realized for sure that they come out of the can.  No little strings in the sweet potatoes.  Those that bake homemade sweet potatoes would understand what I mean.  Still good, just not homemade. My boyfriend ordered the crab cake dinner with cabbage and mac and cheese.  Again, skip the mac & cheese, the cabbage is scrumptious!  The crab cakes fell all the way short.  They're definitely not made from lump crab meat, taste more like a mixture of back fin and claw meat. We also couldn't tell if they were broiled or fried. They didn't taste old per se, more like they were cooked earlier that day when they opened and dropped in the grease when we ordered.  Also you'll notice I said nothing about the cornbread ... because well ... I thought there was nothing to be said about that either.  Too crumbly and dry I think. My boyfriend thought otherwise, he liked it a lot!  After 2 visits I'd give them a solid 4.  I know exactly what not to get and still have things I'd like to try like the fried chicken and ribs.",

SOLIDS:  Fried Chicken Sandwich came with a really nice piece of boneless chicken, fresh piping hot. Collard greens, cooked right (not mushy). Sweet Potato Mash and Mac n Cheese were good sides for the meat.   Loved the hot sauce , just the right mix of vinegar and pepper to offset the plump catfish.  We could tell the oil was fresh, the food did not have any kind of \"old fryer\" flavor - it tasted FRESH Fried!!  Don't go in there in a Hurry - good soul food takes some time to cook.  Get a sweet tea and set awhile.  Kind of reminded me of a family reunion I went to in Mississippi, just good home food.  Brought home mini sweet potato pie and some choco cake with pnut butter frosting YUM YUM.",

    "text": "Thank goodness I found this place.  I was worried I was going to have to suffer out the rest of my existence in Phoenix without decent fried chicken.  Family owned, friendly, accommodating, and fantastic food are all things I love about many different restaurants, but when they come together in one place, you can bet I'll be a regular.  I happened to be in the Ahwatukee/S Phoenix area for work at the end of the day and found myself checking Yelp for places nearby to pick up dinner.  Ezekiel's popped up, the few reviews were extremely positive, and who am I to turn down chicken if everyone likes it?    I've been here about 3 times now (with many more visits in the near future), and the food has been consistent, flavorful, hearty, and filling.  The chicken is juicy on the inside with a wonderful lightly crispy skin; I found myself licking the bones for more flavor when I finished off the meat.  The cornbread was the best side, with just the right amount of crumbly graininess, and I would highly recommend ordering extra.  I wasn't too impressed with the green beans (slightly soggy and overcooked), but I refuse to let that detract from the main dish: chicken.  You go to a fried chicken place for the fried chicken, not for vegetables.   I didn't find the wait too long, though I usually order ahead of time and go pick it up.  I appreciate food cooked to order, rather than food precooked and sitting under a heat lamp.  Yes, more, please!",

This place does not disappoint, to the extreme that they almost cross the line from being an experience of what a True soul food joint should be to a need for a call to the health department.  While there I had to advise the owner that the soda fountain catch reservoir was about to overflow.  He used what looked like a long straw to try to unclog the drain, or syphon it out.  The floors were crazy sticky and in the bathroom ...  The owners wife made the chocolate cake, which was great, and the corn bread was also great.  My wife and I each had the two piece meal, with a breast and a thigh.  The thighs were tender, and well flavored.  The seasoning on the skin and the way it was friend were heavenly.  Unfortunately we both found the breasts to be a bit dry, and then when we got home later we both paid for it.  And I mean like don't venture too far from the bathroom paid for it.  We hadn't eaten anything else that day, so it wasn't anything but what we both had eaten that day, which was the fried chicken.  I eat fried chicken all the time, I am a True believer.  But the last time fried chicken did me like that was when I ate at a KFC about 20 years ago.  I have never eaten there since and have embarked on a decades long journey to find the best fried chicken on the planet.  With all of the positive reviews, I had really hoped that Ezekiel's was going to be the end of my journey but alas this was not to be.  The owner was hilarious to talk to, and tried to take good care of us, which I greatly appreciated.  There was no shortage of customers.  So take this review from that of a white boy who may just have had a bad experience.  In any case, I'm sorry to be writing this review because I had hoped for so much more.   Assume it may have just been an off day for their cook and give them a try for yourself.  Maybe it will do it for you.  Unfortunately it just did not for us.",

I know this isn't home but it shouldn't be THIS difficult to find good soul food. All of the restaurants here always fall short, I don't get it.

The staff are friendly and they offer different hot sauces. Dinner plate is $11.99 with two sides and a corn bread. I'd order ahead of time if I were to eat here again.",

There is signage saying that all foods are cooked after you order and to be aware that it isn't fast food. it did take over 20 minutes to get our food but went with friends so didn't even notice. We all ordered fried chicken and it was great! I ordered wings and they were excellent. The sides choices included fries, collard greens, coleslaw, baked Mac & cheese, cooked cabbage, etc. I had the Mac and cheese and thought it was great. So it isn't a place that I would take a date or a boss but I would definitely take a good friend.",

(Deep breathe)   In the sprawl of suburban Ahwatukee rests a small unassuming family owned and operated soul food heaven. Established in 2012- the owners have over 25 years of knowledge, experience, and love for home cooking. Walking in- I was greeted warmly by the co-owner Laurita. Her smile was just as delectable as the sweet potatoes. This place reminded me back to my days back in Philly; raw-friendly-cool-down to earth-tasty.   Plenty of items to choose from. All made fresh- daily. Everything was on point. Not greasy. Not salty. Not over priced nor spiced. Just perfect.   Thank you Laurita for your time, love & food!   Will definitely be back.   (Sorry this review took so long....)",

There were no strips just small pieces as if they were at the end of a bag of chicken strips and decided to batter the pieces up and sell them... It was garbage and totally wrong to put out trash like that....For $9.00 they should never put out garbage like this!    I call to complain and they told me they ran out of strips at 2 pm (1 hour before our orders were placed) and just cut up some chicken breast and battered them and put them in our orders... I will give them credit for acknowledging that they knew about the issues but why in the world would you put out an inferior product and charge a customer full price...  There is a reason there running out of product mid day at the beginning of the week...It's because business is slow, they don't have the cash for product or they just don't care...Either way, my son and I    will NEVER come back for this garbage nor should anyone else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

My only con is they should seperate the cold potato salad because mine was hot when I got home.  Hubby had ribs,greens and Mac n cheese he had zero complaints. My grandma had the Talapia,sweet potatoes, and greens she also had zero complaints. I will be back not for just the food but to support a local Yorker.

Be prepared to wait for your food if it's busy but keep in mind that it's all made fresh so it's worth the wait. The one complaint I have is that the dessert section on the menu is pretty small, wish they did hot desserts like a fruit cobbler or something along those lines.",

    "text": "This place was recommended to my boyfriend and I by an acquaintance of ours. We were looking for something a little different than usual when we stopped by this place. As it turns out, it's a small little restaurant on Warner in the plaza by Basha's, Chuck E. Cheese's, and many other stores. It was a little tricky trying to find the place but we found it okay.  The ambiance has that family owned feel so it wasn't terribly too shocking that it's family run!   My boyfriend ordered fried chicken lunch with collard greens, cornbread, and had the Cherry Kool-Aid. I had ordered the tilapia lunch with baked macaroni & cheese, cornbread, and had a soda. The gentleman behind the counter gave us an almost exact time (even though it seemed he was doing everything himself).  Once the food came out, my boyfriend and I dug in! The tilapia tasted extremely fresh! It tasted as though they just caught it this morning! The macaroni & cheese actually tasted like macaroni & cheese! The cornbread was as sweet and wonderful as expected!  I took a bite of my boyfriend's chicken just to try how his chicken was - and it was perfectly crisp, seasoned, and delicious! The collard greens were also really delicious!  Originally, we were planning to purchase & eat some dessert but by the time we were done (and we literally ate everything on our plates), we just couldn't eat any more.  However, this restaurant isn't without its criticisms. The Cherry Kool-Aid was way too sweet! Normally, I could handle a lot of sweetened drinks but with this Kool-Aid, it's just way too sweet! I don't know how my boyfriend could handle it since he doesn't really like sweets that much himself. While both the macaroni & cheese and collard greens were extremely delicious, it was still a bit bland. However, it's nothing a little extra salt and pepper couldn't fix.  Now the question remains: would we return to Ezekiel's Restaurant? Of course we would! Despite the minor complaints we share, we can definitely see ourselves become regulars here!",

You order at the counter, which we did, then sat and waited.  It was a bit of a wait, but not bad.  By the time our food came out the place was packed.  I had the fried chicken and honestly think it was the best I've ever had.  I also enjoyed the mac and cheese.  My Mom had the shrimp and collard greens which she really enjoyed.  We both said we would order it again.  Our only request is that they up their game on the desserts.  When you are eating Soul food you need to have cobbler!",

    "text": "I love this family owned Soul Food Restaurant in Ahwatukee. Not only are the husband and wife owners first rate with customer service, the food is so good. If you grew up eating soul food as I did, it is not easy to impress. My Mom was an awesome cook and I took her recipes and learned how to cook well also, However, finding a restaurant that cooks the Macaroni and Cheese with just the right amount of cheesiness, is not easy. Most of the time the mac and cheese will be more emphasis on the macaroni than the cheese.   So I always approach soul food restaurants with a moderate dose of skepticism combined with a healthy dose of hopefulness and anticipation. Ezekiel's does not disappoint. Not only was my Mac and Cheese just right, so were the Collard Greens, Fried Catfish, and Yams (AKA Sweet Potatoes). One downside is there is a wait, because they prepare everything fresh, but the upside is, it is worth the wait. Topping it off with the sweet potato pie, was the icing on the cake. That type of pie is often over done, but again, this restaurant did not disappoint. Excellent SOUL FOOD, and great service with a smile. Although I cannot go too often, since I am trying to lose weight, I have been several times, and plan to go back. Also will recommend to others who enjoy this type of cuisine. EZEKIELS=Great Soul Food!",

We had a variety of items -  fried chicken, crab cake, sweet potatoes, collard greens, macaroni & cheese, and corn bread.  All were excellent.  Stand outs were:  fried chicken that was served up so hot that we had a wait a bit before we could take a bite; Sweet potatoes that had an awesome flavor; Collard greens that were just right - tender, but not mushy and not too salty or sweet like some places.  We were extremely pleased that authentic southern comfort food is now available in Ahwatukee and will be visiting again soon!",

After looking at a few pics of the chicken, mac and cheese and cornbread we hopped in the car and made our way over.  We both ordered the chicken dinner (dark) with mac and cheese and sweet potato casserole. The dinners also come with a piece of cornbread.  The food took a little bit to come out but when it did it was piping hot so you know it's freshly made. The chicken was actually too hot to eat at first so we dove into the sides. The mac and cheese was solid, nice crispy layer on top, not mushy at all. But the sweet potato casserole was fantastic! Big chunks of sweet potato, fluffy marshmallow, mmm, mmm mmm! So good.   Once the chicken cooled down we quickly made out way through our two pieces each. The coating had good flavor, it wasn't too thick, and the chicken was nice and juicy.      A man came out from the back at one point and I assume he was the owner as he was going around talking to people. He was very friendly and knew many people by name so this is definitely the kind of place that has regulars. I can see why. Next time my fried chicken craving kicks in again, I would go back for sure.",

I think they receive alot of online orders, which might delay things for those of us eating in. My boyfriend ordered the chicken sandwich and Mac n cheese and loved the chicken, but he and I were underwhelmed by the watery Mac n cheese. I expected the Mac n cheese to be rich in cheese and it was more noodle than anything else. I definitely plan to come back and try other combinations of their meat and sides but I might order online first.",

On to the food: I got the catfish dinner, as sides I got mac n cheese, and sweet potatoes. I also added a side of mac n cheese and a crab cake. The crab cake had way to much salt. The mac n cheese had way to much pepper. The greens were sweet and I don't like sweet collard greens but if you add hot sauce it's not that bad. The sweet potatoes are NOTHING like the pictures I see with the marshmallows baked with it. They were canned and they added spices...but they were the best thing on the whole order. I did have corn bread an I will admit that was good. Lastly the catfish.... OMG disgusting!!!! It taste like rubber or like the fish had gone bad but they fried it anywhere. Catfish should flake and be very tender when chewing there's it was like steak. There was NO soul in this soul food. Please don't waste your money. I spent almost $23",

It's worth getting out of the car just for that.  Ribs - The ribs were also good.

    "text": "Well I perhaps expected to much as we walked into this establishment. The wife and I decided to come out here because she read that this was the place to come to have some good SOUL FOOD. The first problem I had was that the place was warm...guess the AC wasn't working. The young lady at the counter wanted us to wait while she finished writing something down from her cellphone. I found that funny because there were only two other people in the place and guess whatever was on her cellphone was more important.  So anyway after looking at menu which didn't have red beans and rice.....black eyed peas.....or peach cobbler....we decided to order. I had the fried chicken (white meat only) with the mac n cheese.....collard greens.....large drink.....and cornbread. Chicken was juicy and hot....mac n cheese was good....collard greens were perfect.....cornbread was a little sweet for my taste but it was decent nonetheless. I had red velvet cake for Dessert and that really allowed me to look over the condition of the establishment and the customer service because the cake was REALLY GOOD.   Make sure you print out the coupons from there website.....I have read other reviews where people were having issues printing them. They are not actual coupons.....all you need to do is just print the entire page(s) and bring it to the restaurant....they will honor those. The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you receive but Dulan's Soul Food Kitchen in Los Angeles.....and LOLO's right here in Scottsdale AZ are much better choices for Soul Food. Overall I wanted to give this locale 4 stars....but the customer service and the fact that it was very uncomfortable in there caused me to stick with the 3 stars. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!",

I ordered the 2-piece white meat dinner & selected the baked mac&cheese & collard greens as my sides. Chicken was moist, tasty & crispy! The baked mac&cheese was yummy & the collard greens is the best that I have ever had. They are slightly sweet but with a hint of heat. Corn bread was awesome too. Call in the order so you don't have to wait, but if you don't mind the wait-the owner, Brad Carr, will have plenty to chat about that will make the wait go by fast!! I will definitely be back for more & bring any out of town visitors to experience the food!!",

The food was so good I had to remember I was not sitting in my Aunt Ruth's kitchen.   Brad and his family are passionate about making their last plate just like their first plate. Talk about quality and consistency and you're talking about Ezekiel's.   If you're not from Arizona and are looking for the real deal, Ezekiel's is the spot for you.   Be there or be square.",

I special order and get 3 thighs especially when I am in the mood for Fried Chicken and he literally has the BEST FRIED CHICKEN in the world especially Phoenix!!!.  I come here ALL the time and they know me by name.  Mr. Ezekiel reminds me of how my grandmother cooked for me in Mississippi.  I always order the Fried Chicken with Macaroni & Cheese (LOVE) and the Sweet Potatoes with Marshmallows is HEAVEN! (LOVE LOVE) I get a side of cabbage as well and his Cornbread is always Good & Moist like a CAKE.  His wife makes the best desserts and my favorite is the Red Velvet Cake!  I have been in Phoenix for 8 years and their food is the BEST Fried Chicken and Soul Food Here!  I brought my mother here and she is a hard critic and she loved the Catfish dinner.  My coworkers enjoyed it as well.  After this review you should be visiting them IMMEDIATELY! You have NO IDEA what you are missing out on.  I love them both like family and it is a family atmosphere every time I come in.  Please take my word for it and treat yourself to this Heaven sent restaurant.",

The chicken was seasoned ok but the chicken tasted like it was fried in old oil. If you haven't eaten fried chicken in old oil, it's like eating burnt  popcorn. The catfish looked good but diving into it was unpleasant, it was rubbery & slimy indications of old fish. The seasoning on the fish was bland but the breading held well. I ordered sweet potatoes & mac n cheese as the sides, both were great. The mac n cheese was creamy & cheesy with the potatoes being tender and sweet. It also came with cornbread which was moist & flaky. Although the sides were scrumptious I do not plan to go again.",

Tilapia fillet was seasoned perfectly and was huge, fried chicken lived up to it's award winning billing, ribs were great. Sides: sweet potatoes were a little too sweet for me, but baked beans were amazing, good tasting mashed potatoes and gravy, and good mac and cheese.   Feels like the Owners desire to know each customer.   It takes quite awhile to get the food, but that's because they make it after ordering - and it comes out HOT!

This was my first time here, I had no clue that this place was here. The owner told me that they've been here for two years!! I've been missing out for two years! This place is located in the Bashas shopping center, it's sort of behind the Taco Bell. So skip that junk and head straight on over to Ezekiel's!!  I had the Fried Chicken Dinner that comes two pieces of chicken, two sides and cornbread. I got their mac and cheese and french friends. I can hear my arteries clogging, but it's worth it!! The chicken breast was huge and it was super juicy. The breading tasted delicious and crispy. The cornbread. Super super moist, sweet and tasty. I really can't tell you how amazing this chicken is, words don't do it justice. You have to come experience this fried goodness for yourself. The mac and cheese will make your toes curl. No joke. I wish I was joking, but I'm not. I'm as serious as a heat attack. They make that delicious cheesy goodness there and it's baked. \"whaaaa?!\" you say. yup. It's baked there. The fries were really good too. I don't know what sort of fairy dust they sprinkled on them, but they had me at spud.   The owners are so friendly and easy going. They made you feel welcome and knew how to treat a customer.   If you want some real good food, I mean some REALLY good food, your search is over, my friends. I must warn you, your taste buds will never be the same. This is like taking the red pill...there's no going back. Your eyes will be opened to what good soul food is all about.",
