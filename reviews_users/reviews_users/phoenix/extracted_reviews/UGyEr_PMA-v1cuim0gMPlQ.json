I didn't even get to tell them how much pizza I wanted. I asked how big the dimensions were on the pizza I liked and they said nearly about the amount I was going to order. Why would you say no to a customer in the middle of lunch hour when your restaurant is busy. Poor management is what this sounds like to me. That place is nothing out of the ordinary. Just a floppy greasy pizza just like you get in NYC. I'm sorry but you just can't have a thriving business when you're refusing to make a pizza that is clearly in demand. A lot of the people who work here have sour attitudes and that's a killer when you bring repeat business to their restaurant. I'll tell you all I wanted was a Sicilian pizza which is a pan pizza but them being idiots is going to have them losing my business and my coworkers business as well.",

The boys shared a Margherita large and the crust - while really good - was just too thin in the middle to support the toppings. It was really a mess. The SoHO (salad pizza) which used to be an amazing rectangular flatbread is now just a regular round pizza crust...which was so tough it was hard to cut with a knife. It was still good, but nothing like I remember. Our waiter was very attentive and the restaurant itself was nice as always. But it's just become a normal pizza joint and honestly I'll probably head to Streets of New York next time.",

    "text": "Edit: The people in charge at NYPD really take care of their customers. The person in charge of NYPD saw that we had a bad experience and contacted me to make it right. I really appreciate this in an establishment, and though this experience still happened, I know this isn't the kind of thing that happens here often.   I really like the food at NYPD. I always have, as indicated by my previous review...but my visit there tonight was truly horrific...as far as the service went. The BF and I went there to have a quick -ish dinner before he had to go take a test. We got there at 5 and needed to leave at 6....that should be enough time for us to eat.....we generally spend about 40 minutes in a restaurant, aside from fine dining. When we got there, there were 2 other tables seated...that's it. We came in to get their special which was a half appetizer, a 3 topping 10 inch pizza, and a dessert for 18$, which I saw online earlier today. I asked the waitress about the special and she said she was unsure what the details were, but that she would check on it and get back to us. She came back and told us that the deal was a half app, two 10 inch one topping pizzas, and a dessert for 18$. I then said 'It is?...well ok....' and we ordered that. We then proceeded to wait for 30 minutes for our app, while hearing the manager yell at our waitress about how she messed up the special. Now, I didn't want her to be yelled at, but it wasn't our fault that she made the mistake. I somewhat felt like the manager thought we were trying to get things for free from them, but we really weren't, we would have been content sharing the 10 inch pizza. Anyway, after our app came out (which was good) we waited another 20 min or so until we had to ask for our pizza to just be boxed up along with our dessert because we were 'in a rush.' The waitress said she was sorry she didn't know we were in a rush.....but we hadn't said anything because we WEREN'T in a rush to begin with.....we became in a rush after spending an hour waiting for service and a pizza...meanwhile people came in and ordered food to go and left without us receiving anything. I found this to be unacceptable as the restaurant was fairly empty. So we get our food (in boxes....couldn't even eat at the restaurant) and we got our bill and it was for 25$. I do not know how our bill became 25$ when it was supposed to be 18$ for the deal....but we did not have enough time to argue over it so we just paid it. That was the last straw that made me fairly upset with my experience and really turned me off of (at least) this location of NYPD. As I said, the food was good....but the service was so bad that it didn't made up for it. It caused us to have a stressful and unpleasant experience.....",

She quickly apologized anyway and had my right order packed To Go while i ate the mistake one. Both were good. They were meh. Not exemplary. My friend had their lasagna and she didn't finish everything, she said it was just okay too. Anyway, I'm willing to go back and try one more time.

We got the garlic knots, the large pepperoni and sausage pizza with side of harvest salad.  It was so good. Loved the sliced sausage on my pizza, never had that style before. The salad was great. I would recommend going and giving it a try. I wish they opened one in the Mesa area.",

    "text": "Kids eat free on Wed and now also Sundays with specific adult purchase!   The white pizzas are fantastic!! mmmmmm. The kids get slices (as a kids meal) and the cheese ones are good, too. The seasonal salads have been wonderful--current one I think is called Strawberry Fields? it has nice greens, almond slices, strawberries, apples, cheese, and 2 different dressings.   Got the calzone last night--not recommended. The large (I ordered a small and she made a mistake) was HUGE---large enough for about 5 or 6 people, unless everyone has a huge appetite for a lotta carbs. The dough was uncooked on the inside, and the broccoli and chicken were cold :(.  I guess that process needs some work.  At this particular location, there's always a gal that greets us and keeps calling us \"guys\" in every sentence. It's just a little weird, but the rest of the staff is great.  Again with this place, like at China King, never sure why there doesn't seem to be many people eating in. They do deliver, so maybe lots of ppl have delivery?  They do have patio seating with misters, but right now, kinda hot to eat outside. Probably lovely in the cooler weather.  Kids meals come with a small sundae, so that makes them happy.    The fountain drinks are Pepsi. The diet pepsi tastes bad, and the diet dr pepper doesn't taste much better. They do, however, have filtered water. Your choice of filtered NYC water (tastes great!) or filtered Chandler water.  BTW this location is in the same plaza where Outback, Nordstrom Rack, Famous Footwear, SAS, etc are, so the parking is a little cramped. Not much NYPD can do about that, but it's annoying.",

Perfect cook on the crust (not soggy, not burnt), sauce was very tasty, and excellent cheese:sauce ratio.  It was really good, and the best pizza we had had in Arizona in quite some time.  Thank God!  We had been running into so much bad pizza in Arizona, we were giving up hope.  Hopefully, NYPD will keep up this formula.  We waited 20 minutes for this excellent pizza.  Service was good, bill was as expected.  So bravo NYPD!  We'll be coming back.",

I called to complain to the manager expecting maybe a refund or credit for a free appetizer on our next visit. I was pleasantly surprised when they said they would have the bruschetta delivered to us shortly.   When I told the manager that I felt bad having her driver do that because we live outside of their normal delivery zone, she said it was not a problem at all and that this error was 100% their mistake and they were happy to fix it. Not only did they deliver the bruschetta but they delivered complimentary cheesecake as well.   GREAT customer service! The food is amazing as well...upstate wings will change your life!",

We usually always ordered their Hell's Kitchen Wings & side of Garlic Knots.   Their wings were always on point! The sauce... mm spicy and full of flavor.. dipping it in ranch to cool down the spiciness a bit.. yum. And their garlic knots!! Such perfection.  So warm and garlic-y.. I am a huge garlic & bread lover so this was always such a pleasure eating.  Sometimes I would eat too much and get really full off of it.. refraining me from enjoying the other stuff we ordered.  I once ordered the Buffalo Caesar Salad but it was nothing special.  Just caesar salad topped with pieces of buffalo chicken.  It didn't really go too well together in my opinion because the buffalo chicken was drenched in its own sauce while being on topped of a bed of salad.. drenched in caesar dressing.  It was really a clash of sauces and too much of it too.  Service is always good, price is decent and the restaurant itself has tons of seating and is very clean!  Anyways, if you come here, stick with their wings & garlic knots! You won't be disappointed :)",

There were slices of pizza in a window that you could order but we wanted to order a whole pizza to go. When we asked they told us we needed to be seated in order to order a whole pizza...I was like seriously?!  So we sat down even though we did not want to and ordered a half and half pizza. One side margarheta and one side hawaiian. It was thin and cooked well. The taste was good. I prefer a crispier bottom crust than the one they gave us.  Overall, the pizza was good but the service was odd...",

I was first greeted by a very nice hostess and then taken to my seat. I truthfully was more focused on experiencing the quality of the pizza, until our wonderful server Sydney, greeted us promptly and was probably one of the most friendly servers I've ever had. I was a server myself for years and have had a lot of bad serving experiences and I will tell you this was certainly the complete opposite. She was very attentive, always checking on us, and was extremely sweet. To top it off the BBQ chicken pizza I had was phenomenal. The service was excellent, the pizza was great, so my experience certainly lived up to expectations. I will definitely be coming back. Definitely ask for Sydney if you want excellent, friendly service!",

    "text": "I was born in NYC and spent my summers there every year since I moved at 8. And, I have only been in AZ for two years.  When I say I am serious about my PIZZA... believe me. After someone's suggestion I went to the one on McDowell Rd.  AMAZING, almost reminds me of my fav spot off Jamaica Ave.  And, they even sell it by the slice! I loved it so much I  had pizza there for a week.  But, McDowell is by work, and I live in Ahwatukee.  :(.  So thinking that all NYPD Pizza is created equal,  the family decided to go to the one in Chandler last night.  I won't be back.  Why you ask??  1- We arrived at 6:00 for dine in. We left at 8:00... when we arrived there were literally only two other families in the joint. It was empty!   We didn't order an appetizers ... just One large pizza and a personal pizza.   and we scarfed down our food in literally 10 minutes, because we needed to finish homework and put the kids to bed...   2- Lets see... the \"Large\" was smaller than the one I am use to ... I mean what Pizza doesn't get 8 slices out of the deal?  We don't eat much .. .but we were still hungry when we left and had to stop somewhere else...( and we spent 45 dollars! )  3- No one refilled Anything, or asked us about anything.... we just sat.. and waited... and waited. I almost walked out, but I ordered apple juice for the kids, and didn't want to pay for that and find a new place.  4-And, of course, when it was time to pay our bill... that also took FOREVER. Maybe it was just the night?  Not sure, but I won't be back ....   5-and the pizza wasn't even as good as the McDowell location.   I guess I will have to keep making that drive :(.",

However, they would always redeliver the item or give me credit on my next order.  The last two orders have changed my mind about wanting to ever order delivery from them.  I placed an order in April in which they forgot a bag of chips.  As compensation, they mailed me a coupon that can only be used in the restaurant.  I don't eat out very much.  I prefer to have my food delivered.  I torn up the coupon when they told me there was no way an exception could be made to apply the coupon to a delivery order.  Last night, I reluctantly placed another order.  They forgot a cookie I ordered.  However, I didn't discover the missing item until today.  I am not going to bother contacting them just so I can get another stupid coupon I can only use in the restaurant.  I have been understanding enough.",

Myself, I was not even spoken to, not even made eye contact with. The slim, blonde haired bar tender, zipped right past me. I asked to speak with the 1st manager, who quickly jumped to the bartenders defense. \"It's busy\" as if I couldn't see that with my 4 eyes! He continued to attempt to make excuses for his bartender and became visibly agitated. I asked for my order to be cancelled and speak with another manager. He came out and with a little more tack de-escalated the situation. Long story, long, i was not eating at this location again until Manager Jeff.

She knows how to properly handle food (don't touch it) knows the menu, and made great recommendations. Called the manager over just to say how great she really is, and of course he agreed. Andrew was very responsive and aware of what is going on within the restaurant. Highly recommend this location and Ariana (and Andrew) for recognizing great staff when you have it!!!!! Thanks for a great dinner",

Let me start by saying that they apologized for a bad dinner experience and sent us a $20 coupon for our next dine in visit and not only that , but did NOT charge us for the meal.  That is an awesome way to earn our business and look forward to giving this place another try based on the nice way we were treated after an unpleasant experience.  Kudos to the mgt..  Will post another review on our next visit.",

This is definitely not your typical take-out pizza, and I'd certainly call it a step above many similar businesses.  Great for a quick meal or business lunch.  The only negative thing I have to say is that they over-charged for what I ordered and then forgot part of my meal.  They were, however, apologetic and corrected their error as soon as I pointed it out.  If you're taking a group of people, probably best to keep it around 6 max as they don't have tons of large tables.",

    "text": "I love this place. They are always accommodating of weird requests and treat my 4 yr old daughter great!  This is my favorite pizza in Chandler!  The interior has NYC themed subway markings, street signs, and even apartment windows. Sure, it's a little cliche, but its nice that its a casual place with great food.  This place is family friendly and their servers always make my 4 yr old daughter feel welcome.  They have always accommodated our weird requests.  She loves pepperoni and we regularly request a side dish of the stuff.  They send out a ton for us and it makes her so happy!  NYPD has NYC style pizza that is large, soft, and reasonably thin.  It's best eaten by folding in half, of course.  This is easily my favorite style, even through I enjoy brick oven thin crust and Chicago style.  I will say that most times I simply order a slice or 2 of cheese pizza and venture off to pizza heaven.  The sauce and cheese are great and the quality speaks for itself with the first bite.  That being said, I've tried almost all the specialty pizzas here and really enjoy all of them.  The Pesto, The Big Kahuna, and Margherita are all favorites with my family.  I clearly pay extra to go here vs. other pizza joints, but I happily part with my hard earned money for a slice of NYPD pizza and a cold beer.  Speaking of which, they have a great selection on tap and in bottle.  I've always been able to find something I like and they even have some AZ local beers to try.  Value - 4/5 Service - 5/5 Atmosphere - 4/5 Food - 5/5 Beer - 5/5",

The waiter said it would be a lot 15-20 min when we ordered but it took more like 30-35 min and the place wasn't even packed. The waiter walked by several times when we were waiting and didn't even ask us if we needed anything. Once he was even whistling. Once it finally came I asked for some marinara sauce for the crust. The sauce had a very overwhelming taste of red wine. We wanted to order dessert but my sister was on her lunch break and we ran out of time since the pizza took too long. I'll give nypd another chance because their food is so good, but I was not impressed at all with their service today.",

Yes, they make \"white pies\" in New York, but only as a special order. In New York City where I'm from, the sauce is probably the MOST important ingredient and constitutes as much of the pizza as the cheese or the crust. So all this phoney baloney about this pie being like NYC or the East Coast is BULL!",

We were asked to give a contact number where we could be reached. My husband received a phone call the very next day from a very apologetic: Nichole, listening, understanding and agreeing with our issues during that visit. She was gracious enough to reimburse us the full amount and have personal apology note sent from the Managers. I have to say that NYPD Corporate handled our complaints to the best that they could and with that, we will give them another try. Thank you, NYPD Pizza",

It was also tasteless and had two little dots of sauce on it. My wife and I were laughing as we could not figure out how they took marinara sauce and put two very small dots on the sandwich. It was like they tattooed the bread with a small amount of sauce. Is your marinara priceless or something or do you just not give a crap about the quality of the food. My wife got the Italian cold cut which was a bigger sandwich but very, very plain. It was like someone slapped it together in two seconds. I could have made the same sandwich at home with no effort. The last 4 times we have been burned and I have said \"we are not going back\" but because it was so easy to go because it is close by, I thought, well maybe it will get better. It hasn't and we won't be returning.",

I have known and been able to love pizza all over this country.  When I received my pizza from NYPD pizza in chandler AZ I was not disappointed not one iota. I ordered the Mott Street Lover. I added pineapple. The meat is really what makes this pie! I have to say that the meatballs are what really did it for me. So much so that today I am sitting in the restaurant getting ready to order the meatball sandwich. The sausage is the traditional link sliced and I have a feeling that when they put the sausage on the pie that it is only partially cooked and let it finish in the oven because I can taste the fat that is rendered from the meat. Their choice in cheese is magnificent it has a moist, almost creamy texture. I did not get a chance to eat in the store as I sit here today I am waited on hand and foot. Joe is very attentive. They have a traditional Italian appeal. I am sitting at the bar which has 12 beers on tap.  One of the best pizzas I have ever had. And I travel quite a bit! Did not expect this caliber of pie in Chandler Arizona! This is a must do whenever you are in Chandler!",

When our pizza came out more underdone than we liked she happily offered to bring it back into the kitchen.....which she actually did twice.  Well even though the pizza was delicious, it just was lacking in the crispiness this New Yorker prefers.  Pizza is like that.  It can vary based on oven temperature and who is making it, and personal preference.  The manager, Matt, showed concern and offered recompense which was not necessary.  We kept telling him we still very much enjoyed the evening. It is rare to get the kind of customer service that we got at NYPD tonight, and we will forever be fans!  Thank you Matt and Brittany!",

    "text": "This used to be one of my Phoenix staples when I lived here 7 years ago or visited in recent years.  After going today, I don't know if this is going to be a must visit for me anymore.   At lunch you have the option for express lunch and order from the counter and serve yourself drinks or you can sit down and get the same deals & all the menu options.  I hate taking a server's table, so we elected for full service.  It was busy, but not crazy busy today for lunch.  Our server had a trainee, but it seemed to take forever for everything.  At the end, he apologized for giving crappy service.  He was very polite, but just missed all the serving point.  I had to get a refill on our iced teas on my own from the self service area  since we waited so long with empty cups. I also had to bring my cold pizza back up to the counter. They offered to re-cook it, but I hate wasting food.  They re-heated it, but they went a little aggressive and almost burned it.  The lunch speacials are great since they give you a slice and multiple other options: another slice & drink, wings, salads, or garlic knots; at a reasonable price.    Will I be back?  I'll give them another shot since I have really liked this place for years, but I was really disappointed in today's experience.",

Waited forever to get a few boxes and the check. Kept looking around for the waitress, one time saw her eating a bite of salad at the counter. We  didnt even get a \"how is your meal going?

After waiting more time, finally a waiter came and took the order.    The pizza was okay but not True New York Pizza and it was not made to my request.  No one bothered to read the ticket and just did a regular pizza, not to order.    The desert was a frozen desert that was put in the microwave to thaw out and warm up. It was not good and I was very disappointed.   Over all the place needed a good scrubbing. I could see greasy finger smudges everywhere and lots of debris on the floor.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.",

I ordered that and a small house salad with their house dressing. The salad was extremely fresh and their house dressing was a mixture of balsamic vinegar with olive oil and herbs...it's really good. The vegan pizza is a traditional pizza with Daiya vegan cheese instead of dairy cheese. Typically it has a reputation for being a little bland. NYPD did a decent job of making sure the pizza was flavorful.   The location delivers and offers online ordering. The delivery fee is $3.00 and they deliver as far north as baseline",

They remembered us and got our salads out super fast. The waiter remembered that I am vegan and got me everything I needed to be able to have an awesome pizza experience.   I didn't even leave a rating last time because I would've been too upset. Haha. I was starving and waiting to eat sucked.   This time was AMAZING and saved this review. I'll be back for sure.

I didn't see it on the menu last time, but if you ask you can get  a 1/2 order of the knots (6). They have a few decent draught beers and they are always cold. BTW, I disagree with the soggy crust complaint someone else posted, at least on the two listed above that I regularly get.",

Our server & manager came by many times to check up on us & make sure everything was OK.  The garlic knots were better (less greasy).  The pizza looked better.  It took a little longer than what we were told, but it was not an excessive wait this time.  I still would've liked more toppings & a little less crust.  The desserts were good!  The Cookie 'n Cream was a little too sweet for my liking.  If you've never tried, get the Zeppolis with Raspberry sauce - yummy!",

What impresses me the most however is the prices are superb! You can get a 18\" pizza for about $10 with two toppings, amazing price!  For under $25 we had two sodas, an appetizer and a pizza that easily fed both of us (without the appetizer)  Highly highly recommended!",

He very patiently and kindly explained how it worked: Order a slice and add either a salad, garlic knots or wings.

I don't know whether they've changed their meat vendors or cheese but it's just not as good. The pizza was also very floppy/not cooked enough. I'm not sure I will go back, at least to this location.

    "text": "Well this review is after our experience with our take home pizza last night. Let me start there first. We love New York style pizza. In this part of Chandler there is nothing beside NYPD, that we know of, that is New York style. Our favorite pizza is Venezia's but it is not near where we live, so we have to go with something different. That is why we have gone with NYPD. I have had pizza from this location and company several times, it is great! However..... last night was far from a shining moment. Now when there are only a few ingredients on your pizza and the main ingredient is cheese, you expect cheese to cover the pizza, not even close with this pizza last night. My husband got home with the half cheese, half pepperoni pizza and it was shocking how much cheese was NOT on this pizza! I mean so much so that before I even started eating it, I called NYPD to inform a manager of this issue.  I spoke to two different people before getting a manager, however the manager did listen to the issue and said she apologized for it. She said something about they have recently made changes to the portions on their pies, I took that as \"we recently started putting less cheese and toppings and the cooks are not use to it yet\"... anyway... the manager said she would send me a discount card for another visit, though she did offer to remake the pizza for us right than, but there was no way we were going to wait and go back out again to pick it up. I will say that I don't know if I will return to NYPD for pizza again. We may just go a few miles out of our way to get Venezia's,which we have never had any issues being gypped of cheese or toppings on our pizza. We also got garlic cheese knots and those too were lacking cheese on every knot and not very much garlic, or butter for that matter.. they were very dry and a waste of our money.  NYPD... I hope you are reading this.. You are over priced on a good day! You should never, ever skimp on a main ingredient.. ever! People order pizza because they love cheese, to gyp a consumer of that is robbery. I understand everyone has a bad day, and maybe we got you on one of those but please give your customers what they are paying for every time all the time, that is just good business ethics.",

    "text": "I am writing this on behalf of my father. He has been a loyal NYPD customer at the Chandler location for 20 years. He is always recommending their pizza to others and will go no where else. Because of him, our entire extended family and friends will only eat NYPD. They are from New York and feel that this is the closest to the real deal here in Arizona. We also use NYPD for all of our family events. For the past several years, he has been using the buy one get one half off promotion on Tuesdays to feed not just himself, but my growing family as well. When he called today, he was told that they don't offer this deal on Tuesdays. He explained to the person over the phone that he was not aware of the change and asked if they could make an exception, one time, since his grandchildren were looking forward to pizza night. She repeated that they don't offer it on Tuesdays (even though they have for several years and it even states it on the coupon). He asked if he could speak to the manager. After waiting on hold for 15 minutes, he explained to the manager that he has been a loyal NYPD customer for 20 years and he was not informed that the promotion no longer applied on Tuesdays. My dad is not one to ask for favors from anyone and he is not the kind of person to take advantage. He simply asked for a one time pass to feed his grandchildren (like he has always done on Tuesdays). She refused. I am so disappointed in their customer service. There is no better customer than him. It was a simple thing they could have done after all of the referrals he has given them for the past 20 years.We chose to eat elsewhere tonight. We still love NYPD but their customer service was such a disappointment. Time to look for a new pizza joint. This rating is strictly on the manager tonight, not their pizza.",

When I asked if we could get seated she said \"Yes will someone over...sorry it's national pizza day\". Um hello?! If that's the case why aren't you properly staffed is what I wanted to say but didn't. Finally got seated and ordered right away but pizza never came and my husband and I had two littles ones. An hour later we asked our waiter what is he going on and he said he would check. Came back and said \"not sure what happened but my manager is coming over\" He explained when he asked the kitchen told them they never got a ticket for it. Manager never came over so let waiter know we were leaving.",

Yesterday was National Pizza Day and to think- \"oh no we're not going to order from Pizza Hut or Barro's or Hungry Howies or Jets or Dominoes- no we're going to order from NYPD tonight\"- even though it's TWICE the price. $28 for a small pizza, 6 wings and something that was supposed to be crunchy zucchini but turned out looking more like dark brown salmon croquettes, which were not crunchy at all by the way. The sauce was good on the wings that we asked to be fried crispy but were not. Too tired to take the food back or call and make a big deal- so here's a review to warn anyone else in the near Chandler area. Trust me- I live within 5 minutes of this place and there are 10 other pizza places to choose from that offer better tasting and more appealing food for better prices. Never again NYPD.",

Actually,they should have at least given something off for our dinner to begin with, for waiting all that time for a pick up dinner,not towards our next visit.

    "text": "See that guy down below, that's going to rate this place one or two stars solely based on the fact that it's a chain restaurant? Same guy that's going to tell you that he is an authority on what True New York Pizza should be, and that this ain't it? Yeah, well...that's me. I'm that guy, only...my first visit here, doesn't give me the fuel I need to tear this place apart. It was good. Really good. What can I say? Sometimes you just have to say, get over yourself and sometimes even chains, come through. I've never been to any of the others, your mileage may vary. (particularly if your also that guy..ehem *cough*lying to yourself* cough)   Half order of Zucchini Sticks ($3.99) perfectly breaded, crunchy, not greasy, served with ranch and marinara.  14\" Brooklyn Family Pizza (Thin Crust Of course) ($16.09) delicious, thin, crisp, just enough give to make it slightly chewy, but firm enough and thin enough to fold in half. Pepperoni, Sausage & Basil if i remember correctly. The Misses said she preferred her sausage in crumbles not sliced like pepperoni, but this is a personal preference. I was good with it.  Tiramisu ($5.99) certainly not the best we've ever had, but more importantly, considering the locale...definitely not the worst.  Pint of Santan Hefeweizen ($4.75) Seriously, If we don't support our local brews and vino, who will? Santan in Chandler makes good brew, and you got to give props to NYPD for showing the love.  Total for Pizza Love for Two: $31.72 I know, I know...its not Dominos pricing, but keep in mind we had an app, dessert, and a pint. Keep it in perspective.  I've seen some complaints about service here, not from me...but then we came at a slow period of the day. Our server Jessica was a bundle of smiles and prompt and courteous.   Bottom line. Believe the hype. Don't be that guy. It's good.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of NYPD coz i think they have really good pizzas. I have a NY bias and altho there's very few places that are able to come up with a True NY style pizza, NYPD is close enough. There are four pizzas that I order at NYPD and they are: Pizza Blanca, Da Works, Joey's Favorite and Cheese. I love their Pizza Blanca which is made with Olive oil, crushed garlic, ricotta, mozzarella with your choice of spinach or Roma tomatoes. *yum* I've always liked it with spinach but I have to admit it's exceptional with the tomatoes!! Da Works is their version of supreme, and their Cheese reminds me of pizza by the slice at any pizza place in Queens but not as good as the cheese at this pizza joint my family frequents in Whitestone, NY.   Their strengths are their pizzas. AVOID the calamari, it's yuck and if you've never had calamari this should not be the place to try it... it's GROSS! Their lasagna is not half bad, and their wings are good. Overall, this is one of my go to places if I'm craving pizza or buying takeout. It's True NYPD it's your pizza I trust!",

In the neighborhood is a whole mess of chain restaurants, for some reason I thought NYPD would be different than the rest of Chandler.  Nope.  Sorry, but I can't give this place anywhere near the other 5 star reviews presented below.  I don't want to talk you out of going there, they will feed you, no problem.  The thing is, it ain't all that great.  Maybe they had a good thing going at the beginning but this place is just as plastic as the others.  Everything is satisfactory here, but I really feel they're striving for the mediocre.    The food is good, generic American-Italian.  Pizzas are big and crusty, middle of the road thickness.  The subs are far too bready and the ingredients could be better.  Service was very nice.  I figure this place would be good for lunch, which is super cheap.  Where-o-where in Chandler can a man get some flavor that wasn't shipped in from a lab...",

Dunno if it really IS the water they allegedly ship in from the Big Apple, but their crust is pretty close to how I remember back east pizza being. The appetizers aren't that great, but the pizza is very good.   Took longer than it should have, for some reason I couldn't identify from the front-they weren't busy and our pizza wasn't complicated, but the wait was worth it.

These little nuggets of joy are bread knots cooked to perfection and soaked in olive oil and garlic.    I've never actually gone for any of their specialty pizzas because I like pretty basic pizza -- cheese, pepperoni, black olives, etc.  You also have to try their cold cut sandwich.  My mom is part Italian and this reminds me of sub sandwiches that she used to make when I was a kid.    All in all it's a great dining experience and really good for families.",

It has no flavor or toppings and has a gone done hill for sure ( it had been a few years and now I know wh. Or I have stepped up my game!  Sorry never again NYPD, NEVER AGAIN.   UPDATED REVIEW:  After writing this review a manager did reach out to me From NYPD pizza .He had explained to me how management had recently changed  so they were making a effort to change things. With that being said , I gave them a second chance last night( everyone deserves a second chance, right ? ) I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!  My pizza was night / day from the other night, we did try the artichoke dip ,which was very good as well . So high five for the changes you've made so far. This was the pizza I remembered getting, so that made me extremely HAPPY!  I then received a follow up call from management to make sure i was happy with my meal. This made a huge impact on my thoughts about NYPD pizza . I will definitely be back as well as KUDOS to management! It's the little things that mean a lot",

The second call was made in store showing the manager that our order was placed correctly.  I recorded the exit and how we were treated.  I do not reccomend this locator. Go out of your way to hit the downtown location or biltmore. They have excellent service!!!! The embarrassing part is that we had people with us testing food for a pre wedding catering job.

The staff was wonderful and took it in stride.    This is the first time we had been to a NYPD Pizza and I had heard about them on AZSports Radio.  They recommended them and I wasn't disappointed.    As an appetizer we started off with Garlic Cheese Knots, drum roll... little pieces of Heaven.  Our meal we split an order of Boneless Wings(Medium) and a Calzone.    The size portions were huge, the wings were good and the Calzone was amazing.  The only problem with our visit was, that we took so much food home.  I didn't account for that much food.    Like I said, the food was above average and honestly, I think their service was better.  Our waitress was good and she always seemed to be timely but she didn't hover.    We'll be back.",

    "text": "We picked this for our weekly lunch outing today- glad we came just prior to noon! It gets VERY busy during lunch hour, and I can understand why... it is a great little hole-in-the-wall.   A little confusing... you can either order from the counter, or sit down & be waited on. Either way- you still have to wait for them to bring the food to your table after ordering from the counter, so it seems like it's more ideal to order immediately upon walking in, especially if you are on time constraints.   They have a great selection, and the combos are of plenty but also very easy & accommodating for just about everyone! Prices matched with it being a lovely, very affordable lunch for under $10 (for 2 slices & a drink), and the slices aren't small! I just wish they'd list the ingredients/toppings instead of just having the name of the pizza displayed at the ordering counter. Some of us with pickier taste need a little more info than \"The Brooklyn\" or \"The Sicilian\"... WHAT is actually on each???   Co-workers said the wings were decently hot! They looked great, so I'm definitely going to have to try them next time! I had a slice of pepperoni (not sure what the actual name was on the display tag) which had a very fluffy crust & was perfectly cooked w/ a generous amount of cheese. But I absolutely LOVED the spinach & ricotta slice (also unsure of the proper name they had labeled) but it was delicious! However, the drink station was lacking. Not enough clean cups out, and the only to-go cups were TINY child-size. So it would be nice if getting your beverage was a little easier.   But we all really enjoyed this place & will definitely be back (or ordering, now that we saw they also deliver). The service was good, we were able to eat & depart in about 30 minutes right around noon, so that was a total plus. But the food & prices are great! Glad this was the pick for the week.",

Pies are consistently on point, easy to order online, always fast and friendly delivery.  My husband and I have tried a lot of the nearby NY style pizza places in the Chandler and surrounding area and NYPD on the 101 is our clear winner. Personally, I'm a fan of all sorts of pizza varieties, but my husband, having grown up on the east coast, is a diehard for that real east coast style - big thin, floppy, foldable, and most importantly, executes that ideal sauce/cheese/pepperoni ratio. This location nails it.  As a bonus, leftovers from here heat up really, really well. Lemme go ahead and tell you my trick for perfectly reheating pizza at home. Microwave for a minute and thirty seconds. This will quickly get the pizza gooey again. Immediately put the slice on a hot, dry pan for 45 seconds. This will remove any moisture under the crust from the microwaving and re-crisp the bottom. Put your oven on high broil and hold the pan with pizza under the coils for 20 seconds or more to get that hot n bubbly fresh-out-the-oven surface. BOOM just as good as the night before. You're welcome.  Have been ordering from here for years and will continue! Thanks for existing, NYPD.",

    "text": "We were greeted and sat immediately, server arrived a few minutes later to take our orders and drinks with an unwelcoming attitude and tone. Okay, maybe he had a bad day? 20 minutes later the server returns to tell us things are backed up and there will be a little delay with our food, okay that's fine, it's a semi busy Friday night, totally reasonable.   I ordered a salad pizza which is basically flatbread with salad on top. My partner ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwich. Nothing complicated here.   5 full tables of 4-6 people were sat after us and received all their food within the hour and fifteen minutes we gave this place. At least 8 delivery driver orders had been carried out. During this time our server disappeared from the floor sporadically and only returned to tend to his other tables across the floor, the two managers overseeing the place making their rounds completely ignored our table and eye contact.   Odd part is, our table was located in the middle of the floor and we're not exactly small guys either. So there's no way all these people couldn't see us.   We sat there patiently, giving everyone the benefit of a doubt but were left alone ignored with disappointment. Server never returned to refill drinks or update us, literally avoided our table and turned his back to tend other tables as he came within calling distance. There was no shortage of staff so I doubt he was overloaded.   Unfortunately we decided to just leave after that. left a few bucks on the table for the two sodas we got. Waiting and hour and fifteen minutes for essentially salad on flat bread and breaded chicken in a bun while being ignored is unreasonable considering the place wasn't full at all.  Just sucks to have a terrible experience on your couples night out at a place that has otherwise glowing reviews.",

I heard New York's finest can offer me just a quintessential slice to expunge me of the heinous pizza crime I commited!    Yes!  Just one meatball slice was all it took!  The classic NY slice foldability was on point.  The crust had the perfect balance of chispyness (Chewy and Crispy) The cheese AKA the fats had a nice stretchyness to it.   A really good foldable meatball slice that I ordered indeed.  Since this was an already made pizza slice that just had to be reheated.  Some of my homemade meatsaball toppings were room temperatureish.  So it could've used an extra couple minutes in the oven.  I'll be back for a full size made to order pie with no lukewarm topplings.    Overall this location is a good place to watch a weekend game or why not burn off those calories afterwards and with a high intensity interval dumpster diving session at the Nordstrom Rack in the same plaza.",

The decor is very cute; reminded us of New York City (which we love!) We started off with an antipasto salad that was delicious. For our entrees, the kids ordered pasta (which they both enjoyed and ate every bit of) while my husband and I shared a small meat lovers pizza. It was just \"ok\"; the dough was a little too salty and rolled too thin in the middle, which made it very soggy with all the toppings. Thinking maybe it was just undercooked, we sent it back to the oven. Unfortunately that didn't help much. We brought it to our server's attention and she was super sweet about it; called the manager on duty right over to our table and he offered to have another pizza made for us, which we declined. He kindly removed the pizza from our bill and gave us two complimentary desserts to go. The NY style cheesecake was good, but the limoncello cake was TO. DIE. FOR. I might go back just for that!",

Annoyed I wanted to sign my credit card receipt. There wasn't one. I called to ask where it was and the manager tried telling me that they couldn't print one out. Are you kidding me!? Not even an itemized bill!!! I was pissed and said I want a receipt of my transaction or I'm calling corporate at which time they decided to charge my card a second time!!!! Now I have to wait till the transaction comes out of pending for my money to be added back onto my account!! I asked him why he charged my account again and he couldn't give me an answer. I don't know why it took us this long to finally give them a bad review. They are never consistent and always forget our sides for our order. Now I'm waiting on corporate which has not responded to me yet. Great customer service. Be careful when you order from this place. Pay cash and don't use your card or better yet order from somewhere else. It's sad that they can't get it together. Never again consumer beware. Contact the better business bureau also and already contacted my bank about there transaction. Never again. Done with them. I have never had such poor service and never have a spoken to a manager who seemed so lost. Also we are from New York and this pizza is nothing like that at all!!",

We ended up with a slice of pizza, a strawberry fields salad and some great beer on tap, while sitting at the bar watching Euro soccer! Everything was SO yummy!! Service was helpful, courteous and responsive too! Also, everything was so delish that we ended up ordering cheesecake for dessert! Talk about scrumptious?!?! We will definitely go back! Fantastic place to hang!",

The delicious pizza of the city of New York doesn't come to mind when trying this pizza.     I ate there today and noticed that the booths were dirty.  We sit at a booth that had food remnants on the seats.  I think the waiters could do a better job of cleaning.  If you sit at your booth long enough, then you will notice other things as well.",

    "text": "So there's a new DOLLAR TREE coming to the Cheddars Shopping Center on Chandler Blvd @ the 101. I noticed the sign and pulled into the parking lot last night, only to see the COMING SOON sign in the window. It was dinner time, and NYPD is located in the same shopping center, so we decide to order take-out. We visit the state of New York often, and love the pizza. With a few extra dollars in my hand, (since the dollar tree isn't open) - the hubby and I decide to dine at NYPD. The atmosphere was charming, warm and intimate, but my BIGGEST KUDOS would be the staff. There were only 6 people working that evening, (besides the cooks) and I promise you, we must have met everyone.   NEW CUSTOMERS MEAN ALOT! I really don't know how else to put it. We were greeted with a smile upon entering the door by SHELBY. She tells us how the joint operates, hands us a menu and ushers us to the bar, to sit  & read the menu. Once at the bar, reading the menu, we are approached by the General Manager, MIKE -- he just wanted to make sure we have been helped and are indeed ordering take out, because there was plenty of room available in dining. I stood and went to the register to order our pizza and ERIC, was all cued up with the darling'est smile and most awesome customer service regarding  NYPD's  home made pizza crust, their toppings, and his knowledge of NY's Time Square and good pizza, (he also mentioned having family on the East Coast). The bartender JEREMY came over while we were ordering and started talking about drinks. We followed him back to the bar and ended up sipping FOURSQUARE: Peach and Pumpkin Pie beer. The pepperoni, black olive, fresh garlic pizza was beautiful in delivery, and absolutely tasty to the pallet. It's the closet you're going to can get to pizza in Times Square from Chandler, AZ.   FRESH INGREDIENTS TASTE BETTER! NYPD is all about fresh ingredients. When customer service is as fresh as the food you're being served -- you've got a WIN-WIN SITUATION and a opportunity to make a great dining memory in the process. The hubby and I WON on all fronts. Thanks Dollar Tree -- for leading me to NYPD PIZZA! I will be back.",

The last time it happened the manager said he would send me a gift card. Never did.  Then I thought maybe it was because I had it delivered, so I went in and ordered.  It was like the guy at the counter had been smoking something.  Placed my order, walked to my car, came back in and he could not find my order and asked if I called it in.  I should note, there were two people in the restaurant.  Better step it up NYPD, there are a lot of choices in Chandler.",

The 4 star reviews on this place are accurate. We ordered the Da Works pizza and it was SOLID - cooked to perfection and loaded with fresh ingredients artfully balanced. Balance is critical when you go for mass toppings and they nailed it. It's one of those things that's simple in theory but too many places drop the ball on. This joint takes pride in their craft and the outcome doesn't disappoint.   On a side note, we also ordered a Greek salad sans cheese. Unfortunately they forget the pepperocini's so it was a bit underwhelming. THAT SAID, I called and spoke with Michael (one of the managers) to give my feedback real time. He was attentive, concerned and solution oriented. Everything you want when you pay for something that missed the mark. He sincerely apologized, offered a coupon for our next visit in and assured me he'd pass along the feedback to the staff. Can't ask for more.",

This pizza is thin but not too thin, and somehow foldable and crispy at the same time.  There are also dessert things I saw once, and they were ridiculous. Like dough with powdered sugar and a jam like substance to dip into. I'll need to investigate these further, for your sakes of course. I'm a giver.",

    "text": "Oh NYPD, two steps forward- three steps backwards. I only wish your pizza wasn't good, it would be easier to never go back.   I placed a phone takeout order and was quoted 20-25 minutes for my large pizza and garlic knots on a Sunday night. I get there 35 minutes later and walk in and wait to be acknowledged at the take-out area. There were five employees behind the counter, all facing the kitchen line. No one could be bothered to look towards the entrance to maybe greet customers. After five long minutes a guy turns his head to the side and yells out \"Hey- my man!\" Which apparently is NYPD speak for \"Good evening- how may I help you?\"  The man never asked if I needed help- and instead went back to staring at the kitchen staff working away.   Finally after ten minutes a different employee saw me and asked if I needed help. I have him my name and paid for my food. He silently walked away and went back to staring at the kitchen crew. It seemed like there was zero leadership working. It looked like a member of management was back in the kitchen- working hard helping make wings and other food- which I admire, but there was no one in front of house- which was a disaster.   After 55 minutes, my food was given to me. Not one word was mentioned as to why it took so long, or God forbid an apology offered. Just \"here's your pizza\". Now I realize it's a first world problem when pizza is taking 55 Minutes, and I also understand sometimes things happen. What I cannot understand is the complete and utter lack of customer service. If things are going wrong in the kitchen- or they are behind, etc- just say so. We are all human. I'd get it. But say SOMETHING. To act like it's normal that a simple order takes an hour while everyone avoids talking to customers is insane.  If it is so busy the manager has to help cook, then someone needs to be designated as front of house- and meet the needs of customers. It is inexcusable that five employees are standing with their backs to customers and no one can be bothered to greet people and expedite orders.  If things have gone so bad in the kitchen- then someone needs to take care of the customers and explain what's going on- and apologize. Offer a free dessert maybe. Or comp something. Do anything, other than ignore your customers and when they finally get their food act like everything is normal.   It doesn't matter how good the food is, if it's a total nightmare to try and get it. The level of apathy is off the charts here. This NYPD location is where customer service goes to die. Skip it, you'll thank me.",

As usual the food was very good but our server, Elliott, was above and beyond and then some.  We were here to celebrate our mothers 83rd birthday.  He was so personable, friendly and funny.  We could not have enjoyed ourselves any more than we did and it is all because of Elliott!  Thank you for giving us such a special time with our mother!!",

And thanks for cooking it more and not bothering to making a fresh one.  And thanks for not checking if it was better the second time.  And the manager who we flagged down to fix it.  Thanks for not chomping the meal. You served raw dough pizza.  In his defense he at least got the order right.  And this place usually has great service and very good food. But thats pathetic serving raw pizza. Get it together.   I wish I refuse to pay and wish I stiffed the server. Enjoy your one star review. And guess what I won't be back.",
