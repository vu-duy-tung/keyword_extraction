I got the good ol' buttermilk pancakes, and they were exceptional. Light and fluffy, the syrup (which is their own brand) definitely hit the spot. They advertise that pancakes take up to 30 minutes to cook, but our order came out no more than 10 minutes after placing it. Decided to get a side of bacon and it was cooked perfect, crispy, very good. My wife ordered the Corned beef hash Eggs Benedict and it was spectacular. In fact, if I make it back to this place I'd order this with a side of pancakes. Hash was really, really good and the poached eggs were good perfectly. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is off the hook good, worth the extra money - the small is very small though so go big or don't go at all.  Service was good enough. Drinks were refilled without asking, server was friendly but very busy (there was a 30 minute wait).   Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area, looking forward to going back sometime in the future!",

My husband loves the Dutch baby pancake - not many places have them and you have to allow for 30 minutes for it to cook, but it's delicious. I've had eggs and sausage: the eggs are light and fluffy and very good. The sausage is good too, and the hash browns are fresh and more like thinly sliced fried potatoes than a grated potato square you might get other places. I've also had the blueberry pancakes - so addictive and I appreciate that the blueberries are in the compote as well as inside the batter. The Buffalo chicken wrap that I tried yesterday was the best I've ever had. The wrap/tortilla was fresh and not too thick; the lettuce, tomato and cheese were all fresh, and the chicken was flavorful and seasoned just right with the hot sauce. Usually the hot sauce is poured in and drops out when you eat it, but this one had the hot sauce applied to the chicken before it was added to the wrap, which makes for a much cleaner and more welcome eating experience. Oh, and it came with house-made potato chips and ranch dipping sauce - also yum!",

    "text": "Driving up to Butterfields, the first thing you'll notice is the crowd out the door. Not unusual for a Saturday or Sunday morning, there will be people waiting both outside and inside the restaurant. The crowd might be large, but thankfully due to the number of seats and the fast-paced staff, you typically won't need to wait more than 15 minutes.  From a pure ratings perspective, Butterfields falls right in the middle of my spots for brunch. I frequent the place because of proximity, convenience and comfort. Butterfields is all about the home-cooked style meal that leaves you happy and your stomach satisfied. There are certainly places that are worse, however if you're looking for a unique or exceptional meal, you may want to look elsewhere. This really isn't a bad thing in Butterfield's case, because I believe they are striving to reach the masses with their food. Of all the menu choices, if you are looking for something a little more unique (at least for the Scottsdale area), try the Dutch Baby, a baked pancake of sorts.  This past visit, I had the chicken scrambler with fruit and potatoes. As with most other breakfast places, the portions are quite large here as well. The flavors overall were good, however one complaint I have was that there was too much filler put into the eggs. A lot of restaurants use milk or cream to make the eggs more fluffy, however in this case there was a little too much added. The eggs tasted a bit diluted.  I'll continue going to Butterfields because of the comfort. I'll continue trying different items on their menu, but I feel confident that it will keep consistent with my experience there. For most, that's really not a bad thing.  [This review is based on my visit on July 27, 2013]",

After visiting Butterfields a few times I had my answer, the food is delicious. In fact, everything is delicious in this bustling, get em in, get em out, breakfast spot.  Anyone who has ever dined at Butterfields boast about the pancakes and for good reason. These pancakes are everything a pancake should be, light, fluffy, golden brown,  and very tasty.  Butterfields serves their pancakes with pure maple syrup and pancakes, come with most entree's on the menu.  However, pancakes, arent the only entrees that taste great.  The other breakfast items Butterfields serves up are delicious as well. I really enjoyed the Santa Fe skillet. The chorizo is well seasoned but not overpowering, the onions & avocados are fresh, and the bed of hashbrowns are perfectly crispy.  My lunch companion decided to try  the \"create your own omelette\".  The omelette was large, fluffy, and filled with sausage, mushrooms, and cheese. My lunch companion said, it was the fluffiest and best tasting omelette he's had in a long time.  We both decided to order orange juice with our meal, which at Butterfields is fresh squeezed and delicious.   The servers are helpful and careful to accommodate your needs.  Butterfields is worth the wait.  I am  interested in going back to try their lunch fare.",

This guy needs a raise.  He was one of the friendliest and efficient servers I have ever met.  This place was packed when we arrived on Thanksgiving morning and still only waited about 20 mins.  Their menu is great with lots of sweet and savory choices.  I decided to try the Swedish cakes since I'm a sucker for lingonberries.  They were delish.  I also got a side of bacon that was cooked perfectly crispy.  They let me add cheese and onions to my hashbowns as well since this is a must for me. The prices are great too which is always a plus.  I would for sure recommend this place to anyone. When you go don't forget to ask to be seated in Will's section.",

    "text": "THIS PLACE IS SERIOUS!!! My third time back in a month. This time I took a friend of mine and we have now made a pact to go once a month.   The food is so good that I have to try something new every time I go.  This time I had the Bacon Belgium Waffle. If you love bacon you'll love this one. It's filled with bacon and comes with a bacon on top.   My friend had the Banana Nut Bread French Toast. We were both shocked that it was actually banana nut bread!! And some very good banana nut bread prior to it being dipped and thrown on a cook top.   Now...my friend and I like to eat and wanted to try more than one item so we shared 2 eggs over medium with Canadian bacon and English muffin. Plain dish but still delish. I also heard the cheese grits were in point so I had a side of those. If you like your grits with lots of cheesy and not lumpy then you must try them here. I must say I've never had grits so cheesy, thick and creamy.   As always my son had his Mickey Mouse pancakes. This time with chocolate chips and whipped cream and a side of bacon.",

    "text": "Okay full disclosure: I'm a HUGE brunch snob! Let's call it what it is.. I'm a food snob in general but more so with brunch. I had heard some very good things about this place from a friend of mine and my expectations were super high to begin with. But after having eaten here, I can safely say that the food went above and beyond my expectations. My date arrived a few minutes late and I was promptly served hot coffee while I waited. It's almost impossible to make up your mind about what to order. I kept staring at the menu totally mesmerized by imagining what each of it would taste like. We both finally decided on getting a skillet with pancakes, each. I ordered the New Mexico skillet with scrambled eggs and a side of buttermilk pancakes while my date ordered the corn beef hash with banana cream pancakes. The scrambled eggs were soft fluffy pillows of delicious goodness! This has got to be the best scrambled eggs I've eaten my entire life, by a mile! The lightness of the eggs is almost unreal. The rest of the skillet was quite fantastic too.. They slice their potatoes real thin, so they end up being super crisp. The chorizo was quite fantastic as well and was a really good addition to the already amazing food. I tried the other skillet and banana cream pancakes; and needless to mention, they also knocked it out of the park in the taste department.   I have never been big on pancakes but these pancakes are something else altogether! Incredibly soft with just a touch of crisp. Absolutely divine! The food here is nothing short of ambrosia. I have heard a great deal about their freshly squeezed orange juice but to be quite honest, I wanted to save up room to stuff my face with as much food as I possibly could. By far, my favorite brunch food in Arizona!",

My mom is a huge fan of their corn beef hashbrown. She brags about it all the time. Haha :D  The customer service here is wonderful. Never had a problem since I've gone here.

Pancakes perfectly met expectations - light, fluffy and not overly greasy (unlike like some chain restaurants that taste good but feel like a gut bomb after).   The juice caught me off guard. I was expecting something from concentrate, but no, actual fresh squeezed juice.  And the eggs - wow. All these years I've thought 'you cant screw up scrambled eggs', but truth is everyone else only screws them up. These were surprisingly perfect: light, fluffy, moist and fall apart as son as they hit your tongue.   To top it off they let you choose either fresh fruit or hashbrowns, so I went with the fruit.   All five stars very deserved.",

Not one of those booths that feel like you're dropping into the Grand Canyon. Restrooms are spotless. The hostess & wait staff are very friendly, engaging and helpful.  The food.  I had the Santa Fe skillet. Fantastic! The chorizo was well seasoned but not overpowering. The onions & avocados were very fresh and tasty. The bed of hashbrowns were perfectly crispy. My wife had the California scramble. Actual quote: \"these are the FLUFFIEST eggs I've ever had!\" Cathy, our server, was very nice and helpful.  One more tip, they give plenty of food. We both took home 1/3 of the meal. I'd be interested in going back to try their lunch fare.",

Top banana cakes I've ever had. The egg whites seemed too greasy, but they gave me what looked like 5 egg whites, huge portion. We did have to pay $2 for a small side of real maple syrup. Seems about the size of a jelly packet which seems a bit overpriced. Anyways, will be back again for the pancakes!",

(And the fact that we don't have one here where we live :-(  This place was a wonderful find !!  Originally, on Saturday morning we drove over to Butterfields... saw the long wait ( 10:30 am ) and decided we wanted to get on the road too our destination more than we wanted to try this place out ... So, we headed up north & stopped @ OVER EASY off Bell st.  That was our mistake !! ... We wont be making again ... I posted my review already for there !!  So, really wanting to try this place I convinced my husband to stay in town for breakfast instead of leaving at the crack of dawn ... since it was a holiday weekend and traffic can be a nightmare ... SOOOOOOOOOOO happy we did !!! :-)  Breakfast is one of my favorite meals ... and I'm looking for fresh , delicious , quality ingredients ... whatever I decide to have ... and Butterfield's did not disappoint !!!  My husband got the Whole Hog Scrambler ... WOW !! The mushrooms ... onions ...bacon .... fresh eggs !!! Everything was just so fresh and delicious !!!  And of course me with my sweet tooth ... had to get the berry pancakes with mascarpone ....... I'm still dreaming about them !!!! :-)  Loved the fresh squeezed OJ .. and they had to go cups for taking our coffee to go for the long drive home !!!   The waitress over charged us for the berry cakes on the bill , as she originally put in berry CREPES .. which are about 75 cents more... but I didn't even ask for her to correct it when we paid because the food was definitely worth the extra change !!!   WE will definitely return when we are in town !!! THANKS BUTTERFIELD'S FOR A GREAT BREAKFAST !!!",

But I tried their protein pancakes recently which I think they are knocking off of US Egg, and they were pretty damn good. Better than I remember their plain pancakes being. I still don't understand why orange juice is $5+ a glass. The coffee is still great but expensive as hell too so I drink my coffee before I go.",

We always try and go early as otherwise you can get comfy on one of those benches and wait. And who wants to do that on an empty stomach. That said, the wait its does tend to move on the quicker side.  I LOVE LOVE the Eggs Benedict here. They make their own Hollandaise sauce. The Florentine Benedict is a good option.  The service is always on par. We are not talking overly friendly 'let me be your best friend' type service. But they get the job done. And really I don't think my coffee cup has ever been close to half empty here. So all in all, it works.  The options for kids are great. Love those Mickey Mouse pancakes.  Everyone we always go to breakfast with here has great things to say as well. I will say I feel satisfied after breakfast here. But not to the point where I want to throw it all up because I stuffed myself silly.  It's a winner.",

I know that children in the equation is not the restaurant's fault (I blame the parents who think it's ok to bring small children to a public place then not supervise them), but it adds to the overall rating of my experience so I'm being honest. The staff is another story.... Surly and skulking in the corner are not cool when legit custies are trying to enjoy their meal.   My favorite menu items are here: Veggie hash and Nova Lox platter <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbutterfieldsrestaurant.com%2Fmenu%2Farizona-breakfast.asp%3Fshow%3Dspecialties&s=6eb91868afba1022d01b4055a3e8fcdddb07511f1ff2ffadfb06ff773909209f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">butterfieldsrestaurant.c...</a>  Hopefully my next visit will be better.

Only one suggestion though: In the winter, on Saturdays and Sundays a large pot of coffee outside while we're waiting might be a nice touch. On the other hand the wait is never very long...

Get rid of a skeezy Denny's or something here in Chandler and put a Butterfield's in instead.    The bacon is the best.  Thick, slightly smoky.  Just the best.  And I love that they get the hash browns, which I call home fries, nice and golden brown on the outside.  Just perfect to mix up all that egg yolky goodness with.

Unfortunately, this also meant they were out of the apple pancake.   We decided to order the strawberry pancakes and the smoked salmon scramble only to discover....the smoked salmon scramble comes with hash browns or fruit AND a side of pancakes! For an extra $1.50, you can upgrade from regular to specialty pancakes so we upgraded to strawberry. Since we got everything we originally wanted there, we decided to order the cheese blintz crepes with wildberries.  The smoked salmon scramble and the strawberry pancakes were both great! The pancakes were definitely next level fluffy and a side order of 2 was just right and not too much. The scramble was also perfectly fluffy and the cream cheese inside was perfect.   The crepes were also good (though not as delicious) but honestly, we were so full from the first entree, we weren't able to finish this dish.  The prices here are fair, the service is friendly, the menu is vast, portions huge and scrambles and pancakes are delicious: what's not to like?! I wish we had this place in California!",

I've also tried their Pecan pancakes which are delicious. I really want to try their crepes and that fried egg bagel next time I'm in or even their lunch menu sounds really good.   The only downer for me is that it's quite far for me, but well worth the drive! &  If you go on the weekends there's going to be a wait since it does get pretty busy. I might be writing another review for it once I try their lunch menu. =)",

    "text": "Butterfields is breakfast at it's best.  It is the only place that can make better breakfast than me (I make some mean fluffy scrambled eggs and french toast, and the occasional breakfast burrito when I feel like going all out)  Seriously the best breakfast restaurant I've ever been to (it tops a place in Austin I thought could never be topped)  Portions are large and everything is fresh.  They even make their own orange juice (you can see the squeezer in the dining area and the crates of oranges are a convenient decoration and add a wonderful aroma combined with the other breakfasty smells.   I have tried their omelettes, amazing. California scramble sans the chicken, amazing. French toast, amazing. Pancakes, amazing. Huevos rancheros, to die for.  You can't go wrong at this place. It gets crazy busy on Sundays and you will probably have to wait for a table if you aren't an early bird but SOOOOO worth the wait.  I take all of my out of town friends here, a meal at Butterfields is something I think everyone should have the chance to experience!",

The menu is big, the food is hot and fresh, the service is memorable... So, recently I went here with my husband (for the umpteenth time) and we had somewhat of  \"less than exceptional experience\", yet when we made the most MINOR complaint, we were treated with grace and responsiveness. The manager came over, offered us a tour of their kitchen and team...etc. We were comped an entire meal... we were treated like royalty, which we did not expect nor desire. This team went above and beyond because they are PASSIONATE about serving an exceptional experience to each customer that walks through the door. We will definitely be lifetime guests.",

    "text": "I heard big things about Butterfield's, and the huge crowd and wait seemed to give credibility to the hype.  We waited about 20 minutes on a Monday morning, which is pretty long for a weekday.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict, which is my breakfast staple. I was disappointed as soon as my food arrived. The hollandaise didn't pass my visual test... too light in color, too runny looking. I took a bite and knew my instincts were correct. It had a \"grainy\" texture and was just ok. Hollandaise is the key to a good Benedict.  Anyone can serve an English muffin, Canadian bacon and poached eggs. Hollandaise is what requires a little magic. My hash browns were also a touch undercooked for my liking.  It was \"A-OK,\" but nothing more than that. 3 stars.",

    "text": "A chain restaurant or a local breakfast joint?? I couldn't figure it out the first time I went here. The design of the menu and restaurant is much like a chain restaurant, but with more vibrant colors and a certain energy to it. However, the service and food are indicative of a local, small town diner.   There's nothing better than sitting down and already having your own pitcher full of fresh ice water w/lemon slices setting on your table! I love little touches like that! The coffee is always fresh and served with heavy cream - indulgent yes, worth it, absolutely!  The Blueberry Pancakes (with their delicious blueberry compote) are the best I've had. On a side note, if you get regular pancakes along with another meal, they'll give you a side of the blueberry compote free of charge. I highly recommend doing so! The Strawberry Shortcake Flapjacks are sweet and may make you feel like you've ordered dessert for breakfast, but it's ok to be naughty every once in a while. ;) The Classic Eggs Benedict (which I subbed regular bacon for the Canadian bacon it comes with) wasn't the best I've had, but  I give it an 8 out of 10! The hash browns have always been cooked perfectly - extra crispy!  I've never felt rushed at Butterfield's and I think that's rare for a busy breakfast place. The service is great all-around and the food is consistently satisfying. Yum! :)",

The line seems to be never ending at this spot, but you know that's a good thing when you're talking about a restaurant in Scottsdale where there are so many to choose from.    Food is always great, no surprises there, otherwise there wouldn't be that line.  Regular favorites like omelets and scrambles are done as you'd expect, only probably better.    Atmosphere is ok, as it's just a regular American restaurant.  It's like an upscale Denny's inside.    If you're not in the mood for waiting, I would suggest heading elsewhere.

If we are going for breakfast, I want the things I don't have or make at home.  They have gotten rid of the wonderful crisp hash browns and replaced them with what I would call sliced potatoes that were somewhat cooked but definitely not crispy.  The Mickey Mouse pancake for the kids has lost the small fruit  that used to accompany that.  My granddaughter noticed it immediately, so we purchased a small bowl of strawberries.  I feel even the pancake batter has changed.  Coffee is still good.  We are on the prowl to find something that is as good as Butterfield's used to be.  This disappoints us greatly that they changed.

My veggie omelette was bland and the hash browns were crusty and not greasy, a plus, but not very flavorful. HMOP was just okay.  We also ordered the side of pancakes. Wild berry bliss has a layer of cream in between and was overkill, too sweet. The banana pancakes with cream were covered on tons of cream too. No need for syrup really. I won't put Butterfield's on return visit list.  Probably a bit overrated. They kill you on extras.  Egg whites/beaters. OJ was $5.28. Server Janell was very nice.",

Surprisingly with all the awesome restaurants we have in Phoenix, and particularly Scottsdale, we are seriously lacking in the breakfast department. Not a lot of options for a good breakfast that isn't a big chain.  I always get the German Pancakes, \"The Dutch Baby\" (as long as I have time to wait the 20 min extra for cook time for them), they are quite delicious if you love lemon and butter as I do. Bacon is really good and consistent. Everything else to me is average. Omelet's are good, pancakes are okay...coffee is pretty good and they use cream, my pet peeve is when restaurants give you milk for your coffee instead of cream.The Hash Browns are kind of bland to me. I am always a sucker for fresh squeezed OJ.  My 4 year old eats the chocolate chip pancakes pretty good and the 16 mos old likes the silver dollar pancakes he can eat by hand.  Nothing has been as good as the old JP's Pancakes before that changed ownership, so this is the next best if you are accommodating kids and are sick of IHOP.

While the service is still great, the quality of the ingredients is going down, down, down and they seem to be shrinking the helpings and at the same time raising the prices.  Here's the scoop.  The omelette use to be terrific and now it is a shadow of its former self.  Be ready for a disappointment if you order bacon, eggs and toast.  The bacon is run-of-the-mill, where as it used to be thick-cut with some seasoning.  The wheat toast used to be on the thick side with a lot of taste, now it is thin with no taste.  Will I go back--yes, but with some skepticism about the product.  Now, instead of going here once or twice a week, I will now start trying other places.  This significant decline in quality may be a sign of the times:  a new minimum wage law was enacted in Arizona and this reduction in quality may be Butterfield's attempt to adapt to the new economics.  Personally, I would be glad to pay more and get a superior product while helping the friendly and professional staff.",

    "text": "Holy deliciousness!!! This is a popular place for good reason.   1. FOOD- Big selection of breakfast and some lunch items. I can personally reccomend the Popeye scramble (lots of spinich and the bacon is thick cut!), banana and pecan waffle and Irish Benny (house made corn beef hash - YUM.) Coffee is suprisingly good too! Boyds I believe is the brand they serve.   2. SERVICE- Fast, friendley waitstaff. They all were very attentive with drink refills and the kitchen pumps out their food faster than I thought possible!! You may have to wait a little while for a table, but once you're seated you get served right away.   The atmosphere is friendly but you don't feel pressured to get out the second you finish eating. For a few bucks more I would eat here every time hands down over Denny's (which is just around the corner). The only downside is that they close at 2pm, so no dinner service or late lunches. Been there a few times, and this is definitely \"our new place\" for breakfast :-)",

We're not talking high class breakfasts, but the food is familiar and comfortable which keeps me coming back for more.   I consistently order their chocolate chip pancakes and they never disappoint. Fluffy, buttery, and sweet = DELICIOUS. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is great too.The service at Butterfield's doesn't disappoint. I don't know if I've ever seen bussers clean a table so quickly.   If you come on a weekend, you can pretty much guarantee a wait. Luckily, the people-watching here is so much fun that the time flies by. The atmosphere is typical of a breakfast spot...open, noisy, and relaxed. If you're a Scottsdale or Phoenix resident you can often count on running in to someone you know. So if you're slightly hungover and still wearing your clothes from last night you may want to find a new place to help soak up that alcohol...if not, that's great too....be proud of your walk of shame!",

    "text": "It's True! After several failed attempts to eat at Butterfield's due to the long wait time, I can finally say that I've finally had the chance to actually eat here. So what did I think? It was most definitely worth the wait!   There's a reason Butterfield's has a two hour wait on the weekends. It's because this isn't your average breakfast. They don't just have basic omelets and pancakes on the menu. No, they have succulent skillets filled with cheese, hashbrowns, eggs and toppings galore. They have buttermilk pancakes with different flavors such as Oreo cookie pancakes. They have bacon Belgian waffles. They have oven baked pancakes! The menu is large and in charge and this breakfast definitely leaves you full for the rest of the day!   During my first official visit here, I ate my heart out. I ordered the Santa Fe Scrambler which comes with eggs (I opted for egg whites), Chorizo sausage, red jalapeno pepper, onion & cheddar cheese. All this sits atop freshly made crispy hashbrowns. As if that's not enough, the scrambler comes with your choice of pancakes or toast. Of course I ordered the homemade buttermilk pancakes! The feast arrived relatively quickly and it was absolutely a feast! There was no way I could finish the meal, but every bite I took was better then the next. The hashbrowns were the perfect amount of crispy and the Chorizo had a nice kick to it. The avocado and peppers blended in quite nicely and there was plenty of cheese to go around! I doused my buttermilk pancakes with Butterfield's homemade syrup and wow, they know how to make a carbtastic pancake! I wish I could have consumed every last bite, but I ate until I was full and left happily full!  I'm so happy that I've finally had the chance to eat at Butterfield's. Now that I know how delicious the food is, the wait time won't seem so bad anymore.",

I got the smoked salmon scramble and it was perfect. The bathroom was clean, which is always important to me. The only thing that didn't make it perfect was the three ladies at the hostess counter.

The french toast was very light and fluffy and not dripping in egg batter. Our server was friendly and fast. I've never had bad service here!  My only cons are the prices. They charge $2 for a side of strawberries, which would be fine except it was literally ONE strawberry sliced up. A side of bacon (4 pieces) is $3.95. I wouldn't mind paying that for a thicker cut...maybe even peppered bacon, but this wasn't anything special.   I definitely recommend Butterfields. If you go on a weekend, plan to arrive before 9:30 or be prepared to wait AT LEAST 30-45 MINUTES. But you won't be disappointed!",

My youngest can't get enough of their french toast, my oldest daughter loves their waffles, Dh loves the scramble he got, can't remember the name now, but it was Mexican inspired. I love their omlettes, and the second time I went back I enjoyed their pumpkin bread french toast!! SO good!! They have delicious looking apple puffed pancakes which I plan to sample on my next visit. Their toast is good too!   Their coffee is good too. Not sure why all breakfast places can't make a good cuppa' joe, but that should be a given. Theirs is so good!!  Just wanted to add another vote for Butterfields!! Wish they put one in Gilbert so I could enjoy it more conveniently!! There's often a wait, but so worth it! We may have to go this weekend :D!",

I opted for the smoked salmon and cream cheese scrambler. I figured I couldn't go wrong with Nova salmon, onion, scallion, cream cheese & chive garnish. There were big chunks of salmon and cream cheese throughout with just the right amount of onions and chives. I wasn't able to eat all of the eggs, but man it was good. The grits I got as the side were hot and creamy and gone pretty quickly. The hash browns were alright, but I added a little hot sauce. My husband got pecan cakes, eggs, and bacon. I did try bites of his pancakes and the bacon. Everything was delicious. Service was attentive. It felt like we were in and out within 30-45 minutes which was perfect since we needed to get to the airport to catch our flight.",

I ordered some french toast, eggs, an English muffin and some fruit (I like a big breakfast). I was pleasantly surprised at the speed to which it came out of the kitchen. Quality of the food is just outstanding, even down to the fresh fruit, which in most restaurants can be absolutely disgusting.   Service was pretty great as well, the second we arrived we were greeted and sat, our server was an excellent ambassador to the restaurant. Being it was my first time, I just had some general curiosity about the business and she answered my questions without hesitation, was always there when we needed her for something.

Their fresh OJ is like drinking liquid fresh oranges . . . oh that's right!  That's what it is!  It's pricier than most pancake houses but I think it's worth it.  It's nicely decorated with lots of light wood and well laid out.  The service is always pretty punctual and attentive.  If you go on a weekend, expect a long wait . . . up to an hour or more.  We try to go on a weekday and we are usually seated almost immediately.  The reason for the long wait is obvious once you've eaten there.  Their breakfast offerings are not your typical ones although they do have all your standard favorites.  I've sampled quite of few of their breakfast dishes.  Eggs Benedict is a personal favorite and theirs is very good.  I also like their buckwheat pancakes.  My wife prefers their crepes.  They are conveniently located in mid town Scottsdale just east of Scottsdale Blvd. on Shea Blvd.  Hands down our family's favorite place to have breakfast when we are visiting Scottsdale.",

It seemed like we had a team taking care of us, not just our waitress.  I could not believe that this location is 14 years old - it was spotless - like it just opened on the day before.  We will always come back to Butterfield's.",

    "text": "Butterfields was recommended to us as we made our first visit to the area and it didn't disappoint.       While the restaurant was at least half full, and it is quite large, we were visited promptly by our attendant who was very accommodating to our needs   I ordered the veggie scramble and instead of a pancake asked for the blissful French toast, came as a half order and an up charge but it was SO worth it. The veggie scramble seemed to have more than 2 eggs, plenty of veggies, the potatoes were ok. They weren't flavored in the least and not all of them were like the \"hash\" being crispy. The French toast was amazing. Super nice and fluffy brioche bread with a decadent but not over powering mascarpone sauce and lightly warmed fruit.  Hubby ordered the corned beef hash and again a very large serving PLUS the corned beef is made in house and was super flavorful with plenty plated.     Finally we also ordered lunch to go: the French dip which was not particularly flavorful, and the chicken Cobb which was plentiful with bacon but not so much the chicken which was also not seasoned.   Breakfast A+ Lunch C Service A",

The waitstaff was all new and not \"polished\" as I had before experienced great servers.  We had to ask multiple times for coffee from different servers.But they were friendly. Pancakes just so so.  Nothing special.  Eggs were very fluffy.  I think growing too fast and rotating the servers who understand the breakfast flow will probable make me not return for another visit soon.  Maybe another time.",

You HAVE TO wait for your drinks first and only after you are allowed to order your food. Also you never know how long your drink order will take.  Manager explained me why they have such a policy. All to convince the kitchen, not the customers.   I work in food and beverage industry and this is my first time experiencing nonsense policy like that... If you are looking for a good breakfast place, butterfields is ok option, but there are lots of other great places where you can order your food and drinks at the same time haha.",

I will start with the baked pancakes. The pancakes take about 30 mins to cook, I will tell you this dish is well worth the wait. We ordered the Dutch Apple which is enough for two people. We took ours home and warmed it up in the oven and added a scoop of Blue bell ice cream on top.  I have not had a bad meal at either location. Butter's is on our valley breakfast rotation...great food.  Butterfield's has more dinning space than the other location but the quality of service and the quality of the product is spot on 100%. Our waitress was Ebonique, she is the real deal. She did an outstanding job making sure we were completely satisfied she was thorough and knew the menu as well.",

I finally made my way to the hostess to put my name on the list. They take your phone number so they can call you when your table is ready, and you can track your progress on an accompanying app, which is kind of cute.  Anyway, I sat outside on the bench for about 15 minutes. I was surrounded by a gaggle of retired folks in super casual clothes. I texted my friends, \"I don't think I fit in here.\" And I didn't, but I was hungry.  SERVICE EXPERIENCE  I finally got the call that my table was ready. The manager was extremely nice and sat me at my table.   My server came by right away. She was EXTREMELY SWEET.  I got the berry blintzes, corned beef hash, thick bacon, fresh orange juice and coffee. DELICIOUS.  I was enjoying everything until I noticed a man just staring at me... Like NON-STOP staring. I thought he would eventually stop, but he didn't. He saw that I noticed, so he put on his baseball cap and his sunglasses and covered his face with his hands, but wouldn't stop staring. I debated telling the manager, but I just left instead.  CONCLUSION  It seems like the restaurant is VERY WELL run and managed. The food was fantastic. Unfortunately, the crowd the place attracts is not my scene.   4/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbutterfieldsrestaurant.com&s=f9cdc55d21a62af7fe233cf2a0de38f430357bd7223c1e495b262ef2dd790754\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">butterfieldsrestaurant.c...</a>  *I notice on BUTTERFIELD'S PANCAKE HOUSE's website that they have a location in Illinois too.  *There is plenty of parking.",

Fortunately, I encountered it yesterday and still crave the comfort food that rewarded our long hike.  I'll try to be short and sweet but not sure that I can!  The Corned Beef Hash Skillet was one of the best corned beef skillets I've had the pleasure of enjoying. The beef was just right. I don't know how to explain it, but at other places, the beef was stringy and dried out or other places it looked like it was straight out of a can, but Butterfield's corned beef just looked freshly ground (and of course cooked well) and inviting! The over easy eggs were perfectly done and the potatoes were just the right slice thickness and size.   You automatically get a pancake trio with the skillet, but you can upgrade for a few dollars more to the specialty pancakes. As much as the Oreo s'more pancakes seemed the way to go, I went with the wild berry marscapone pancakes. I loooooved these pancakes. The perfect sweetness and the marscapone filling were such a treat!   I washed all of this down with freshly squeezed orange juice! Smooth and fresh! What a great way to start the morning!!",

    "text": "OMG THE PANCAKES!! Don't judge but I'm not a huge sweet breakfast person, I usually go for the more savory breakfast items so when my cousin kept raving about this place and the \"best pancakes evvver\" i was skeptical. I'm happy to report she was completely 100% correct! And I got the best of both worlds..you can order savory dishes and get a smaller amount of those heavenly cakes on the side MIND-BLOWN! We went on a Saturday around noon and the place was packed (for good reason) but the employees there are like well oiled machines and sat our large party promptly. I'm not sure if you can make reservations but if you can that's a great idea. Our server was excellent, super efficient and the food came out quickly and piping hot. I ended up ordering a glass of the fresh squeezed OJ (do it! It's deeeelish) and the Bacon, onion, mushroom skillet which you choose your egg style on top and then of course for my side the Wild-berry Bliss Cakes which I dream about still..sooo fluffy and the fresh berries and cream just heavenly.",

While I was assured that everything I ate was gluten-free, it definitely wasn't (tummy troubles began 10 minutes into my meal... I was hoping it was just indigestion, but symptoms turned they way they do when I've been \"glutened\").   They have gluten free waffles and pancakes on the regular menu, so I went in with high hopes. I asked about the hash browns and sausage links and were told they were GF. I ordered the GF pancakes (which come as a side to the two egg breakfast). The pancakes had a very strange aftertaste (almost like there was cheap, not-cooked-out, too much vanilla extract... it was strangely alcoholic) and I wasn't convinced of the texture (VERY spongey). The hash browns were meh, plus I think they were the culprit. They tasted frozen (there's a certain texture that fresh hash browns have, and frozen hash browns are always suspect as most frozen potato products are coated in flour to prevent sticking together). While the ingredient list may not have listed gluten, would someone have noticed if it just said flour, especially if it didn't say wheat? I just don't know.   They were also out of any caffeinated black tea. For breakfast. At a breakfast joint. I ended up with a passable green tea, but it wasn't fabulous.  I won't be back.",

My favorites are the whole wheat pancakes or one of the breakfast skillets, the latter big enough to serve two. I also like the friendly wait staff. Since breakfast tabs tend to be on the low side, I usually over tip because the wait staff is so great. Tell the wait staff what you want and you will get it. They also usually offer to refresh your beverage (tea, coffee, diet Coke) to go, which is a very nice touch in this thirsty desert climate. If they don't offer, just ask. I have never had a bad meal at this place. One waitress went above and beyond when I took a friend who was still woozy after a medical procedure for his first meal in a couple of days. He was being a little crazy and difficult, but our waitress handled it. There is usually a short wait, but this place is worth the wait. Once inside, be sure to look up so you don't miss the funky & fun decor touches.",

I explained this to the hostess & was told by the manager & the hostess that we would not be seated until they came out. I said we all walked in together you saw us. They said they would not seat us. Finally after another 10 minutes out came the rest of our party.    I was so taken back by this rule of every member of your party being present to get a seat, I opted to leave. In an area were breakfast restaurants are plentiful I will not be returning to this restaurant ever again.

They had borrowed napkins from the neighboring table and when they realized they had missed some, the asked the other table to borrow some more. At this point, the owner scolded the family for excessive napkin use and that they MUST ask him for any extra napkins. The family told him they just wanted to finish their meal and move on from what now had escalated to an ordeal. I overheard the husband ask the owner for another napkin as they had been directed and the owner snapped!! He called them smartasses and excessively yelled at them calling them horrible names. He then proceeded to kick them out (though I'm sure they would have left ASAP regardless due to his behavior) and told them he was CONTACTING THE POLICE for disorderly conduct. I'm not sure what resulted but as someone with connections to law enforcement, it seemed that the owner was harassing the family with his verbal assaults not the other way around. He's lucky they didn't call the cops on him.   To the owner: I know owners are encouraged to respond to reviews. DO NOT respond to mine or I will contact the BBB. There is nothing to discuss. Also, screaming, \"FUCK YOU!\"  in anyone's face, let alone a woman's, is never respectable.",

Came on a Sunday during brunch hours and yes there was a crowd and yes we had to wait. Our party of 8 waited about 20 minutes before being seated but it was well worth it.   They have an orange juicer right in the middle of the restaurant and it definitely made it tempting to try the juice. My one year old nephew had some juice and it was great to see him enjoying something without extra added sugar.  I ordered the Irish Eggs Benedict and it was hands down one of the best breakfast dishes I have EVER had!! Yummy corned beef hash with onions and the hollandaise sauce was on point. Best of all my yolk was runny in the middle just as they should be. Everyone at my table ordered different items and everyone seemed satisfied by the end of the meal. My five year old nephew finished his whole plate of chocolate chip pancakes!  I guess I am lucky in the sense that I didn't have to interact with the manager during my visit and our server was sweet and attentive. Will definitely return next time I visit!",

The baby apple is definitely something you don't want to miss out on! Fluffy, covered with cinnamon and not too sweet. The atmosphere was great, their layout and decor is well themed and the staff was very cheerful and wore smiles like a fashion trend. A big shout out to our girl Vesaliki - She made the experience well worth the trip! Funny, charming, she did a great job popping in on us and go above and beyond our expectations! Having people like her in a establishment make customers want to return just for the way she makes you feel welcomed and like family!",

Waited about ten minutes outside on the bench before we were notified and walked to the table by the hostess. They were on point, it didn't take long for the busters to turn tables and get another set of diners in. Our server was spend is. She recommended items that were popular and explained to us the baked pancakes.  We love new creative things so we both ordered entrees. The Irish Benny was delicious. The hollandaise was creamy and buttery and the egg poached perfectly. My girlfriend ordered the eggs verde and raved about them the whole time. She saved me a tiny bite and I'd agree.  The baked apple pancake was different and delicious. The server brought us honey and lemon and taught us her strategy and we were very excited about it. There are a ton of different options to try and we can't wait to come back.  It's hard to find a breakfast joint with food let alone a menu that drives you to come back.",

    "text": "George and Ted Syregelas have quite the growing breakfast empire going in the Scottsdale area.  Between their flagship breakfast and lunch restaurant Butterfield's and their breakfast only concept Butters Cafe, they've got the Scottsdale breakfast crowd wrapped around their little fingers.  Granted it's pretty hard in the grand scheme of things to screw up breakfast compared to most meals of the day (though I've found a few in the past).  But like Butters, Butterfield's brings two characteristics that always earn a big thumbs up from me.  Quality and consistency.  Most of Butterfield's offerings are standard, while some push the envelope ever so slightly.  But even if the breakfast doesn't have a lot of pizzaz, I'll gladly come back for a good old fashioned meal done well.  Early morning on a Saturday, I had a hankering for a special kind of pancake.  You can find Butterfield's Scottsdale location on the north side Shea and 74th Street (just east of Scottsdale Road).  The location is quite large with seating for I'd guess upwards of 125 or so at max capacity.  One thing you'll catch right behind the hostess up front is the fresh squeezed orange juice being made constantly for all to see.  Its a good first impression to make to the diners and likely the reason their OJ is so wildly popular.  The menu (like Butters) boasts a pretty wide array of items including pancakes (obviously), omelettes, skillets, french toasts, benedicts, waffles, you know the drill.  Despite a fairly large dinner the night before I was surprisingly super hungry.  Good thing because there were a couple of full sized items that had my attention.  I love pancakes and since that's what they're famous for, I felt it obligatory to get one of those.  But it was actually one of their benedicts that I wanted most.  Actually it was more of a southern dish than anything.  The Country Benny reads (mostly) like your traditional biscuits and gravy.  This one with poached eggs and sausage on a biscuit with white gravy.  Plus a side of potatoes because, well, one must.  The pancake I was interested in wasn't a stack, oh no no.  I just wanted a single pancake.  A single baked pancake that is.  Whaaaaaat, you ask?  We're talking one of their Baby Apple baked pancakes.  Essentially a fluffy cast iron skillet pancake.  Admittedly I had no idea how big one of these was (more on that later), but I figured it must be fairly filling if they're only selling one at a time.  And of course a large glass of their fresh made OJ to wash it all down.  Total cost for everything including tax and tip came to about $35.  The OJ is as good as advertised.  Fresh, not a huge amount of pulp, but delicious without being overly tart.  The baked pancakes take about 30 minutes to make here, so I got my benedict first.  Great portion with plenty of that rich gravy to boot.  There's just something luscious about mixing poached egg yolk with gravy (or maybe that just me).  Biscuit was warm, flaky, and fluffy, and had nice big hunks of sausage.  Shortly after I finished the benedict dish, the pancake arrived.  And this thing is a monstrosity!  Took up dam near the whole plate and was quite literally the size of a cake.  Had to be at least an inch thick and 8 inches diameter.  Self doubt immediately crept in as I was sure I wasn't that hungry.  One bite in though, and I knew I was pushing through that wall no matter what.  A soft fluffy cinnamon pancake doused with candied apples and powdered sugar.  Throw a little butter in the middle and you've got yourself a breakfast dessert for the ages.  For most, this alone would fill up one person for breakfast.  My advice?  Grab another breakfast dish, then share one of these baked pancakes with your companion for dessert (and yes, dessert for breakfast is allowed).  The majority of their dishes are $10 or less so most of you can get a good meal for cheap without going crazy like I did.  But wow that baked pancake was worth the insanity.  Next time I'll probably give their Dutch Baby baked pancake a try.  I also like the fact this place is open early on the weekends, which is good because I'm an early riser and like to beat the weekend brunch crowd.  The Syregelas brothers know what they're doing and the crowds (and the stellar Yelp reviews) at both their Butterfield's and Butters restaurants are all the proof required.  Breakfast done right, or in this case breakfast done better than it has to be.",

An image of mouthwatering fluffiness of heaven and deliciousness over came me. I slide into the booth and waited patiently for the stack of heaven to be pushed in front of me. I reached for warm syrup and begun to slather these thick, fluffy, scrumptious, delightful, pancakes....I eagerly  cut off a bite and lifted it toward my mouth. No disappointments.  The sweetness of the syrup, right behind it was the melted butter, and the crunchy pecans. Each complemented one another with perfection. Syrup cascades down my chin and I go in for another bite. Who wants pancakes now?  Service was excellent!",

Service was excellent, with not only my waitress who took my order, but the whole staff was very friendly and checking to see if I needed coffee refills or anything.  The place was bright, very clean and open.  Irish Benny is pure genius! Two of my favorites: eggs benedict and corned beef hash, that had an added bonus - carmelized onion! Yum!  Hash browns are the traditional expectation but sliced and browned potatoes. Didn't eat much because I had to save room for the blueberry short stack that were light and fluffy with blueberries inside. Very good.   Wish you were in L.A. I'd be there very often!!",

We waited about 40 minutes for a table which was not bad considering this restaurant is always packed. We got seated and placed our order. We then waited...and waited...then noticed that larger parties, seated after us, were getting their meals and we were left wondering and waiting. Our waitress finally came over to let us know the manager was going to look into why our food was taking so long. After over an hour wait, we finally received our meal. It was delicious as always and my Dad loved the chorizo in the Mexican omelette. The manager came over and apologized for the wait and informed us that he would be taking care of our breakfast. What impressed me was how he took ownership of their error and made it right stating that there was \"no justifiable excuse that our food took so long to arrive.\" Thank you so much for making our visit right. We live in Chandler and don't get here often, but we can't wait for our next visit! Thanks again!!!",

I got the Chorizo Burrito, wifey got the Corned Beef and Hash, son got the Country Benedict, and the girl gets pancakes topped with Oreos.  I also started with a freshly squeezed large OJ.  Good stuff.  Chorizo is usually overpowering but the amount was just right.  I could actually taste the egg, cheese, and veggies that were also in the burrito.  The side of potatoes that came with the dish was excellent.  I had a bite of the corned beef and hash and that was very good too.    Servers were very nice and the food came out in a timely manner.

When we pulled up and seen the huge line of people waiting I thought the wait would be over 1 hour and was surprised when the hostess said 20-30 minutes and they will call my cell phone when our table is ready. Not only did they call but they also sent a text which was great because we opted to sit in our car. I am not really a OJ drinker but because of yelp thought I had to give it a try and ordered a small glass. I wish I could have ordered a gallon to go- it was the best OJ I have ever tried. I had the pecan waffle with sliced bananas and yes they put the toasted pecans in the batter-don't know why but it really tastes better in the batter. Husband had the skillet breakfast and he said it was good. Our waitress was great and told us the owners were from the Chicago area ( we are also), though we had never heard of Butterfields. She also told us about the Butters cafe locations which was closer to our hotel so we went to Butters Cafe the next day. And yes it was even better.  Please, Please open in Las Vegas.",

To be honest, I was going to order pancakes but judging how they looked from other people's plates, it seemed less appealing!  Kind of plain and boring, if you would.  I had no regrets! The 4-inch diameter waffle was thick, moist, and had enough crisp around the edges! For an additional $2, I opted to add some fresh cut strawberries! Finish it off with some in-house syrup and butter, you got yourself a breakfast of champions! ($8)  As for the Hash Brown, the shredded potatoes were crisped perfectly at the top while the inner part was fresh tasting! ($2)  I washed all that down with a large glass of sweet, yet delicious orange juice!  This was probably the best fresh squeeze I've ever had. ($5)  The meal was not heavy and portioned appropriately to keep you away from an afternoon nap.    Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and operated as efficient as she could as the restaurant was at full capacity.   All in all, I would rate my experience as mostly positive with one caveat: the wait.  Expect a wait and steep bill!",

    "text": "I visited here from Los Angeles. My best friend goes to school at ASU and worked here. MY GOD. I wish this restaurant existed in Los Angeles. The food was the best American breakfast I've ever had in my whole life. This place makes all the breakfast places in Los Angeles a laughingstock! I'm surprised there's none here. I forget what my orders were called. They look good in the picture but, believe me, they tasted better than they way they look in the picture. They served orange juice that is genuinely fresh squeezed from oranges. The only thing I don't like about them is they don't give us flavored coffee creamer with our coffee. We have to stick with bland coffee creamer and add sugar. Nevertheless, this place still deserves 5 stars because the amazing food compensated for it's shitty coffee. If you're ever in proximity to Scottsdale in Arizona, you definitely have to check this establishment out. You're missing out in life if you don't try this place at least once. Not only was this place the best breakfast place I've ever eaten at, I think my meal, which was everything you see in the picture, only costed $10.",

We arrived with a group of over 10 people and they managed to push some tables together and seat us in a reasonable amount of time. Our waitress was also super cheerful, fast and accurate. She got all of our orders right and managed to have all plates on the table at the same time.  Best oatmeal in town. They actually use the slow cooking whole grain Scottish oats and not that instant Quaker stuff. I love the healthy menu choices, such as light rye bread and egg white omelets. I had the spinach and feta egg white omelet and it was awesome.   The menu is so extensive that you could literally come here for a month and never order the same thing twice.",

I hear the pancakes are also very good and the bacon was thick and chewy. Definitely worth the stop if you like breakfast. It was recommended by a local and it didn't disappoint.

We dined a total of 3 days straight for breakfast, and each time I ordered something different for breakfast. This is a popular place for sure! They do their best to keep your coffee cup filled at all times, and the orange juice is freshly squeezed with pulp in it. The toast is thick, which I really enjoy. The bacon is awesome and I would love to have it all of the time!  I believe they are open from 6:30 am to 2:30 pm and the lines and wait moves fairly quickly.  I loved the pancakes, again the batter is made fresh. The waffles were good too. The sausage benedict was ok and I wish I had tried something different. My friend loves the biscuits with gravy which is also fresh and tasty.  I will miss you Pancake house, but rest assured I will see  when I return to the area.",

So upon arriving in Scottsdale I figured Butterfield's would be just as good as any place I had decided to pass on while searching the Phoenix metro area...but am I so glad I came here.  A) Extremely CLEAN and bright inside, nicely decorated and open, servers galore. It's in Scottsdale so it's a nice area and judging from the cars in the parking lot, higher end income...  B) Great wait staff. Someone is always walking around with coffee, you do need to ask for cream but it's amazing cream in a tiny little chilled metal cream pitcher.   C) This place is a pancake house...the pancakes are excellent, though not sure if the size of the cakes I got were standard or smaller, since I got the egg plate...if that is standard size they're pretty small but delicious none the less. Real maple syrup at the table(?) I forgot to ask but it seemed it by the way it poured. I ordered an extra egg for 99c and what came out seemed like five eggs so that was awesome. The bacon, three pieces, was excellently crisp and good sized, very delicious. And, I was able to sub hashbrowns (sliced potatoes) out for cottage cheese.  All in all this place is the place to go for breakfast in 'Phoenix'. Whether there are comparable places in Phoenix I wouldn't know since all those I actually went to sucked and either had lame menus, no one to wait on me, or laughable prices (yah I went to a few and just left). I would highly recommend coming here, it's worth it in every way. Ted is a great manager and Bree, my server, was great too.",

When I finally got called in and my son was in the bathroom they denied us a seating and when we asked again to be seated they said: \"No breakfast for you\"... It was funny and sad to see a business acting in such an arrogant way towards their customers. We left gladly across the street to \"The US Egg\" with no wait, better food and better service.",

I also had a side of the corned beef hash to offset the sweetness of the pancakes and it was so-so.  My husband had the country benny and that was really good too (especially since the white country gravy was not too heavy).  We have to recommend the OJ as well.

We looked over the menu on yelp so we don't waste anymore time thinking of what to get.   We ordered a cappuccino, vanilla latte iced, & a caramel macchiato iced. The cappuccino was hot, tasted like nothing in it just espresso. The vanilla latte was okay, tasted alittle sweet. The caramel macchiato tasted sweet ( more then the vanilla).   For food we got the cheese blitz which was okay.  My brother got the New Mexico skillet, it was good alittle spicy. It comes with hash browns & with toast or pancakes (we got both) & your choice of eggs, we got scrambled eggs. The pancakes were so good, taste like homemade!  I got the omelette I made my own with bacon, sausage, tomatoes, green pepper, avocado, spinach, cheddar & extra cheddar. It's .25 per item. It comes with hash browns or grits & toast or pancakes. I got hash browns & toast. The omelette was so soft & cheesy! It was delicious! My brother loved his food. I loved my omelette!   The place is nice inside and big, they also have a patio to sit outside.  Great place to come and good prices!",

    "text": "Saturday Morning to-do list was extensive that required plenty energy, water, and nutrition (Organ Pipe). Where else would I have been able to garner the necessary fillings knowing that we ran the risk of having no real food for 10 hours in the unforgiving Southern Arizona 115 degree heat? Butterfield was the spot.  Before I divulge... My first option was Butters Pancakes but their parking situation was stupid so I just left. I am not going to waste time driving in circles for a parking spot just to wait another hour or so to  sit and another 30 min to eat. There is more important ways to utilize the limited time I had to try and attempt everything for the day's ambitions.  There was a short five minute wait at Butterfields with plenty parking.   Service: A The staff was nice. No attitudes on my visit. The waitress and floaters accommodated for all my weird quirks and particulars. Thank you.  Location: A Located in a mall setting in Scottsdale somewhere. I'm not a local so can't comment much. The roads are large and the joint is visible off of the main road.  Decor/Interior: C This is nothing bad. The decor is bland.  Food: A (without the omlette). F (with the omlette). Omlette/Scrambles: F.  Let's just start with the bad. My body rejected the omlette. I don't know how else to say that without being vulgar. I will just leave it at that. If you are considering between omlette and others, you have been warned.   Hash Browns: A Certain hash browns were commercialized. Still good though.  Protein Pancake: A I chose this flapjack out of practicality. As mentioned above, I needed the proper energy. This hearty filler provided the necessary carbs/nuts to keep me over for over 10 hours. Flavor is as you would expect: dry, however, that doesn't mean you can't make it taste good. Just add a bit of syrup and jelly. I used a puny amount to avoid needless bad sugar intake.  Taffy Apple French Toast: A Amazing flavors. It's sweet. No syrup needed. The warm apples and soft french toast were nice.  Cinnamon Roll French Toast: A This is super sweet. i wouldn't recommend this if unless your going to sit on the couch all day. It's basically a flat cinnamon roll with the option to add powdered sugar, syrup and butter on top.   Overall: A This would be a regular spot if I was local.",

It's a larger venue, so the wait time is a lot less. They also have a bunch of two seater booths, which is really great if you have a small party.  I came here with my son and got a skillet and a side of wild berry bliss pancakes with a mocha latte. My son got the Oreo pancakes. Holy wow. All of it was so freaking good. Those pancakes are so perfect and amazing. I'm sure they would be delicious plain, but the wild berry bliss are next level. I've never had better pancakes in my entire life.  I don't like waiting too long at restaurants, but I'd happily wait a stupidly long time to dine here. Butters and Butterfield's, I love you so.",

    "text": "I hate to write a review of Butterfield's and give it two stars. The only reason it's not getting just one is because I did enjoy the place for a long time. My favorite thing on the menu was the cheese blintzes -- those are hard to find anymore (IHOP used to make them, then around 2000 or so, they changed the recipe and ruined them; Village Inn quit making them decades ago). Butterfield's was the only place I knew of to get blintzes, and theirs were the real deal.  We don't live nearby, so it's a bit of an event for us to go eat there. I'm also not a morning person, but I would get up early for cheese blintzes! We went this past Saturday, and they had REMOVED THEM FROM THE MENU. They apologized, but honestly, if they truly are just crepes filled with ricotta and cottage cheese, and you still have crepes on the menu, you couldn't scrape together a plate for loyal patron who drove 45 minutes just to have that specific thing, one last time? Safeway is around the corner. I'd have bought some ricotta for you.  I ordered French toast instead--which I wasn't in the mood for, and it wasn't good, either. It didn't have any flavor, and it had no crunch to it at all. Denny's and Village Inn both have far better French toast.  Butterfield's has lost a long-time customer--one who has sent and brought a lot of people to them over the years.",

Nearly 1,000 reviews and 4.5 stars? Had to do it....and I totally understand the rating.   All of the food was delicious and there were SO many options, the service was fast and friendly, and the restaurant was very clean. We're big breakfast people and this was easily the best breakfast I've had in long time.   The only complaint was that it was very noisy. So noisy, in fact, that it was difficult to have conversations at our table. The bussers could stand a little training on how to clear and set a table without clinking glassware and flatware. That will likely help with cutting down on the overall noise levels. Patrons won't have to increase their own volume to be heard over the clearing of tables, etc.   All in all, though, this is a restaurant that I look forward to returning to again and again.",

Not a great start. We got our food, which was mediocre at best. Orange juice was on the pricey side for a small glass. At the end, we, again, tried to get our servers attention to get some to go bags and to go butter. She left to go to the back for maybe 10 minutes until we had enough of waiting. Eventually, we just got ourselves plastic bags from the front and left. It really depends on the server you get; that's what makes a restaurant worthy of 5 stars to me.

The ambience was bustling. Our server was courteous, and quick. I had the pancakes and an omelet. Everything was cooked to perfection. The pancakes were fluffy and had strawberries on top. The hashbrowns were crispy and golden brown. I would definitely make another trip to Butterfields as it is top notch!",

I had the eggs with hash brown potatoes and sausage patties. I was not a fan of their eggs as it had a milky texture. The hash browns were like pan-fried potatoes, which is not what I imagine when I think of hash browns. The sausage patties were standard, and the pancakes were delicious! I've been wanting to go back here just for the coffee.",

I went there to enjoy a birthday breakfast with my family - and I can't say enough that this choice was spot on.    I was really surprised at how busy they were - I am not a huge fan of crowds so we went at 10:30 - a time I thought would be fairly slow.  Shockingly - they were super busy and I thought \"Oh no - this will take forever!\"  I WAS SO WRONG!     We were seated fairly quickly and the hostess was as pleasant as could be.  It was obvious that our server was taking care of several tables - and looking around it was obvious that many were repeat clients.  There was a warm rapport as she quickly acknowledged each diner.   She was gracious, efficient and friendly - I believe her name was Angela.  She took our order and was quick to refill our coffee.     I was also surprised to see the manager on duty (I believe Chris) stop by each table to ensure all was going well.  He offered a quick pleasant hello and sincere welcome to the restaurant.   The meal itself was a very tasty treat with my basted eggs perfectly cooked!  I now can see why this restaurant was so busy - everyone from start to finish was warm and engaging - and the food delicious!  I'm adding this to one of my favorite places!",

There was a bit a wait but is worth while if you have the time.   The Wildberry Bliss Crepe for $ 8.95 satisfied my craving!  This french crepe stuffed with wildberry mascarpone, topped with vanilla cream, fresh wildberries & glaze is sweet and rich.  No low cal here!  The only mishap was after I informed my server that I have a nut allergy,  specifically ordered a dish that did not contain nuts and after being reassured by the server that  I could indulge in this dish, my crepes arrived with a couple of pecans on the side of my crepe.  \"They must have fallen off another dish while in the kitchen\", was my only reply.  Good thing my girlfriend and I saw it for I would have had to deal with an allergic reaction from this  slip up!!!  I forgot to mention that my Nancy M. enjoyed their gluten free pancakes.",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Another Chicagoland transplant that I grew to love there, and still like here.  The pancakes really are the star here, every other dish is pretty average,  On our last visit, I went off-script and ordered the waffle.  Apparently you can order them \"well done\" to make them crisper on the outside like a Belgian waffle, but even ordering like this - the waffle was just very average.  The base pancake batter that they use for their waffles doesn't translate as well into the waffle form.  The bacon, too, is average at best.  Average thickness, average texture, nothing special.  The pancakes, especially the specialty pancakes, are worth the extra money.  So is paying the premium for the real maple syrup and not using the sugar-water on the table.  In the past, I've had the apple oven-baked pancake, the banana, the chocolate chip, and the cinnamon roll.  All are good to very good pancakes.  The oven-baked apple pancakes are thick and hearty and super filling.  The other pancakes are thinner but have enough filling and topping to make it worth the extra money for them.  There's typically a wait, and it sucks having o wait outside in the summer.  But turnover is pretty quick and it is definitely worth the wait for this place if you're in the mood for a pancake.",

The atmoshphere was very clean and friendly.  The fresh-squeezed orange juice machine near the kitchen double doors was a subtle reminder of the fresh quality of our food to come. Our dishes came in a very timely manner, piping hot and delicious - mine was the best California Scramble and Fluffy banana pancakes EVER!  Paired with a carefully prepared mocha, complete with a delicate chocolate syrup swirl on top.    I work in the property management industry in a large community in the area and had to run off to work right after breakfast.  I have already recommended Buterfield's to several residents today!

Despite his proclamations, I remained calm and said, \"I have lived near this location my entire life (34 years), and Oregano's Chicago Pizza across the street has always accommodated this request without an upcharge.\"  He made yet another proclamation, \"I'm from Chicago!\".  I responded,\"Well, I am not.\"  He fired back,\" Well, let's get real, how many of you people are there here?\".  At this point, my wife and I could no longer put up with his lack of professionalism, and left the restaurant.  As a native to the Phoenix metro, I'm am aware that there are not many natives here compared to the mass of Chicagoans that have invaded, but I have not once taken issue with them and nor them me, until this visit to the Chicago-biased Butterfields.  I have definitely never been referred to as \"you people\" as a Phoenix native before.  This review is as perplexing to me as to why a restaurant manager from Chicago would move here to pick a fight with the entire native population to Phoenix.",

This was topped with their touted \"cinnamon-apple compote.\"  It was tasty, but only contained exactly 3 pieces of apple.  Not acceptable. If you like grits made with heavy cream, you'll like their grits.   Hash browns are made fresh, but they are overly greasy. Portions are modest but not stingy. Service was rather suffocating.  I don't need attention after every third bite.",

    "text": "I have been eating at Butterfield's since it opened a few years back. It has quickly become a family favorite, and I always order the same thing - it's hard to stray from sheer perfection! I build my own omelette consisting of ham, cheddar cheese, and mushrooms with hashbrowns on the side and a big ol' glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. This is the best omelette I've had in Phoenix/Scottsdale besides the Ritz Carlton - and let me tell you, I have had MANY ham and cheese omelettes :)   However, I find it odd that they call themselves a pancake house. My family and I do not like their pancakes, nor have any friends that I have brought to this breakfast spot. They are crumbly and lack the buttermilk flavor that I look for in a perfect pancake.   Overall, the omelette is SO good that I can easily forego the pancakes. The service has always been great and the food is delicious - this will continue to be a family favorite!",

However, on this last visit, we were very annoyed at the other servers and managers. It seemed to be the time in the shift when the manager had cut down to just a couple of servers. We were sat and waited about 5 minutes to be greeted. We were fine with that, as we are both in the restaurant industry and could see that our server received several tables at once. It took a while to get out coffee and our order placed, but again we were fine with that since she was clearly busy. However, we could hear other tables getting upset at the lack of service, though they were to blind to realize their server was busy. My annoyance came about when I noticed the manager, 2 servers and 3 hostesses standing up front screwing around instead of helping the busy server. Would it be too much to ask to help your fellow employees by getting refills, running food, or doing anything to help? Apparently the manager is only there to chat with the hostesses half of his age.  Aside from this, the food is always delicious and I would recommend this breakfast joint to anyone. I would also recommend some training on how to help your coworkers!",

This place reminded us a bit of a great small pancake house in Anaheim, CA called the Original Pancake House. It is much bigger and modern, so it lacks charm, but the food is better than standard faire. With that said, the creativity is good in their menu selection, but poorly executed. I had the banana french toast and was a bit disappointed. The banana bread used was fine, but too dense for french toast. It hardly had any egg coating to truly classify it as french toast.   They serve huge slices of raisin toast, but bigger is not necessarily better. Very dry and not flavorful.   Eggs were fine, and the service was good. I would come here before going to IHOP, but I would seek a different small hole in the wall breakfast joint before rushing back here. Avoid the Sunday brunch hour patrons, unless you're prepared to wait an hour or so. Enjoy.",

My server had a difficult time with figuring out how to take the egg order to begin with, and then when, contrary to what I ordered, the eggs came out with runny whites, she took them out and brought me eggs with even the yolk cooked hard. I paid for it, but left pretty disgusted without eating most of the waffle, and only one bite of the eggs.  Looking up their menu on line since my visit, I realize that instead of charging me $6.25 for two eggs any style, my two eggs should have been .99 each since they were to accompany my waffle... That means I was overcharged in the deal on top of the eggs never being correctly prepared.  I made a note to myself not to go back.",

Sure enough, I get there 5 minutes later, and the bag is waiting behind the register for me ready to go!  Everything that I've ordered has been great.  I'm not claiming that it's the best breakfast restaurant in all the land, but it's definitely far above average with consistent quality with fast service.  If you like chorizo, consider the New Mexico Skillet, or if you're looking for something more delicate, try the Spinach and Gruyere Crepes.  When given the choice between Pancakes and toast as a side, don't be weird... get the pancakes. ;)",

I'm a scrambled eggs guy, and nothing's more unpleasant at breakfast than rubbery, overcooked eggs, but I must admit, Butterfields has the fluffiest scrambled eggs I've ever found (I can't even reproduce them at home). The potatoes are sliced like thick potato chips and browned on the flat top, and the bacon is pretty good too. I haven't tried their espresso drinks, but their coffee is smooth and strong- just the way I like it, and they'll bring out full-fat cream if you want to lighten it up. Some of their pancake options are closer to dessert than breakfast, but worth a try if you have a massive sweet tooth. Now the downside: Don't wait until you're hungry to get a meal on the weekend, because this place is BUSY, and you could be waiting an hour to get a seat. However, even when they're that busy, the food comes out pretty quickly.",

    "text": "We made the drive up to North Scottsdale to try out Butterfield's, and left satisfied.  In addition to more sweet items such as pancakes, French toast, Belgian waffles, and crepes, they also offer savory breakfasts such as skillets, omelettes, and scrambles.  The ingredients are very high quality, and they take a lot of care to make a great tasting meal for you.  Feeling like I was in a caffeine deficit, I decided to try out the caramel macchiato (A little over $4, can be made iced or hot).  It was a nice blend of sweetness and creaminess, and the coffee itself was very smooth.  The coffee drinks are served as a 16 oz. size, so although they are pricey, you get a good amount of drink for your money.  After poring through the extensive menu, I decided on the wildberry pancakes ($8.95).  They were moist, fluffy, with a nice selection of fresh berries (Blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries) on the side.  Sandwiched in-between the pancakes were a mix of blueberries and a berry-mascarpone filling.  The pancakes were also coated with a lovely drizzle of vanilla cream (Made with real vanilla bean) and berry sauce.  There was enough sweetness and creaminess in the dish that I didn't need to add any syrup at all, nor add any of the butter that was included as a side.  The only thing I didn't really like was that there was a small amount of the mascarpone filling, and since there was just a smattering of it, it tasted like hot cream cheese inside the hot pancakes (Not very appealing to me at least since you usually associate mascarpone/sweet cream fillings with cold temperature).  My friend had an egg-white omelette, which was quite possibly the fluffiest egg-white omelette I've seen, and quite fluffy compared to normal omelettes I've seen!  I had a taste, and it was really well-executed.  The flavors inside the omelette were perfect.  I also tried some of the chorizo skillet, which was a very good portion, with hearty amounts of chorizo, veggie, cheese, and potato.  We came here on a Sunday around 10 A.M. and waited about 20-25 minutes for 3 people.  Service was friendly and fast despite the busy atmosphere.  Butterfield's is definitely one of the top breakfast places to go if you don't mind the wait!",

    "text": "I've never been a breakfast person....if there's one meal that I habitually skip, it's brekkie. Mainly because I either:   A. wake up just in time to get my ass out of bed, shower, get dressed and make it to work on time  B. If it's a weekend, I've slept in past breakfast.  or C. If it's a weekend, I'm in a hurry and don't have time to wait to be seated.  All of these notwithstanding, Butterfield's is one of the those places that has forced me to SERIOUSLY reconsider my attitude towards breakfast.  Here's why:  Their sausage links are SO damn good. Being the creature of habit that I am, I got my usual breakfast consisted of sausage, poached eggs (poached egg haters, HUSH!) hash browns and white toast.  Back to the the sausage: HUGE and bursting with flavor: not too spicy, certainly not bland. The Hashbrowns were delicious: freshly cut and cooked in butter, not rancid lard. Eggs poached perfectly.   To top it off, FRESH SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE and delicious coffee.   The place looks like it was an old CoCo's that was brightened up a bit. You'll still feel like you're in a coffee shop so expect a cheerful but not fancy atmosphere. Trust me, once you've taken a few bites, you won't give two shits about the atmosphere.  Seriously one of the best breakfasts I've had and it's right here in my backyard.  If you want a good brekkie in The Valley, check these guys out...you'll be glad you did!",

    "text": "Good news for Butterfield's. After a couple years or so of having altered the menu, it appears that they have brought back the ever-so-popular oven baked specialties.  Although the menu is not 100 percent the same as before, having brought back the baby apple pancake and dutch baby have made the trip up to Scottsdale worth the trip for an indulgent breakfast.  Aside from the noisy and busy environment, and tacky but fitting decor, Butterfield's does have some stand-out items on their menu. From the fresh-squeezed juices (albeit small and overpriced portions) to the unique egg specialties and pastry items, this is the place for an occasional breakfast treat when you want something a bit more upscale than the traditional chain diners.  The highlight on the menu, in my opinion, is the baked baby apple pancake. Prepare for the 30 minute wait, and if you want any shot in being able to finish a decent portion of the plate-sized \"pancake\", don't eat anything before your visit. The large treat comes to the table piping hot and is puffed up a couple of inches tall. Although all of the caramelized apples and brown sugar are begging to be eaten at the moment's notice, do yourself a favor and wait another 5 minutes to avoid burning your mouth and ruining the rest of your meal with this fresh-out-of-the-oven delight.  The apple pancake (more like an apple pie that you can have all to yourself), is packed with the equivalent of no less than at least 2 granny smith apples. The thick, doughy crust and the sticky and crunchy brown sugar topping keep you forking for more. Despite the time it may take you to work through this beast, the steam keeps pouring out.  The service is pretty decent, but with the crowd of people and all of the glass and ceramic cups and plates, the clatter and chatter can get very ear piercing. If you come on the weekend, expect a long wait, but the staff moves tables quickly and the restaurant is nice and clean.",

It's a more local version of an IHOP with extremely fresh ingredients, a more lively atmosphere, and attentive service.  We sat in a comfortable booth - It was a funny scene as Kevin N and I went in with our computers and cell phones and both called into a conference call while we ate our breakfast. (We did this so he could eat before jumping on his flight back to Austin).  I had multi-grain blueberry pancakes with a side of egg whites.  I requested sugar-free syrup and got it within seconds.  It was delicious and the perfect breakfast for the day after an elite event (slight hangover).  Kevin had one of their specialty oatmeals and a side of bacon.  It looked and smelled really good too!  It was my first trip to Butterfields but it won't be my last - yay... another breakfast place in the Valley :)",

    "text": "This place should actually be called Butterfield's and Associates Cardiology.  If you are looking for an egg white with veggies omelette and a side of turkey bacon, I'm sure you could.  However, their specialty is found in their name--butter.  Everything is butter tasty.    Their pancakes so good that after having them, we craved them for the next week.  They vary is tasty extremes, going from the normal buttermilk (there's the butter again), to gluten free, to Oreo cookie and s'mores pancakes.  Their short stack is an excellent side though a good meal in itself.  My personal favorite is their wild berry pancakes and their blueberry pancakes.  Both are stuffed with berries and the wild berry is smothered in cream.  I am gaining calories just by writing about them.  You want French Toast or waffles, they have those too.   We all had various items off the menu.  I chose a Create- Your-Own-Omelette with Nova Lox, cream cheese, red onion, and a side of hollandaise sauce. Another member of our group tried the Mexicana omelette.  Mmmm...finally decent chorizo in a non-Mexican restaurant.  The omelette came with avacado, cheese and a green chile sauce.  Besides omelettes, Butterfield's also has skillets, scramblers and other egg specialties.    The only problem I saw was the waitstaff and the wait.  This is a large, popular restaurant.  With so many people, there is an initial wait and then there is also a wait for our food.  If you go, try an off time.  What ever do, don't go on a Sunday morning!  You will wait at least 45 minutes and then wait 30 for your food.  Other than that, this is a wonderful breakfast place to take family and friends.",

    "text": "4.5 stars So we have been here twice so far. We went on a Monday morning end of April, since I read reviews, we were concerned about the wait. This place was full but we got in pretty quick, under 10 minutes. Service was awesome, seriously. We had two waitresses constantly checking on us and our refills. The coffee was excellent, probably the best coffee anywhere. I'm used to coffee being watered down and tasteless in restaurants.  The coffee here is blended special for this restaurant and if they had a drive-thru I would prefer it over famous coffee chains. Coffee is strong and flavorful and free refills! They will even give you coffee to go, if you ask. I got the blueberry pancakes the first time and a side of bacon. Pancakes were light and fluffy delicious, blueberries on inside were a decent portion and lightly dusted with powdered sugar. Pancakes don't come with any sides:(. Bacon was perfectly crisp and a nice light sweet and smoked flavor.  My husband got the Mexico Skillet both times, he gets a skillet with chorizo everywhere we go and this was the best.  This particular dish was a bit small in comparison to their other items and to other restaurants, but you get an option to for pancakes as a side. The second visit I ordered the California scrambler, which I thought would be healthier...it had a super buttery flavor, a bit much for me and I only ate a third. I won't get a scrambler again. I got a side of French toast which in all honesty was a disappointment. It was very plain, I think they need to add vanilla extract and a pinch of salt. My husband's pancake wasn't as good as first time, so maybe just an off day with a cook.  Most recent visit was end of first week of May. We still had excellent service and coffee. Definitely one of our new favorite breakfast spots!",

    "text": "Alas, I hate to put an end to the string of five-star reviews for this establishment, but I had a rather mediocre first experience at the much-ballyhooed Butterfield's this morning.    I'll start off with the good points.  I really liked the spinach scramble I ordered (I opted for the egg white sub), and the cheese grits I sampled were light and tasty.  The coffee was decent, although not up to that of, say, Breakfast Club (I believe they serve Illy) or even the private-label stuff at Wildflower.  (NB: The heavy cream served with the coffee was unnecessary.  Being a part-year Canadian, I think the best cream for coffee--if used at all--is the 18% mf coffee cream widely available in the Great North.  More flavorful than half-and-half, but not quite as sludgy as heavy cream.)  Now for the bad points that made it a two-star breakfast for me.  First, the pancakes: I paid extra for two multigrain cakes instead of the buttermilk and was horrified when I bit into one.  It seemed undercooked in that it was soggy and tasted of raw flour.  Undeterred by the setback, I had my BFF dining companion give me one of her buttermilk pancakes.  Better, but still none of the slightly crunchy bite that epitomizes that golden \"crust\" of a perfect pancake.  Being a throwaway starch side to the meal, I would have let the gross pancakes slide, but for God's sake, this place bills itself as a \"pancake house.\"  (Incidentally, if you're thinking there's no such thing as a tasty multigrain pancake, try the protein cakes U.S. Egg serves up.  The PCC Men's Grill will also whip up delicious ones to order.)  Second strike: Butterfield's \"maple syrup.\"  I've had plenty of maple syrup of all grades (interestingly, the cheaper/lower the quality of maple syrup, the stronger the maple flavor), and the stuff they put in their private-label bottles is the oddest-tasting maple syrup I've ever sampled.  If, however, you are a fan of ersatz syrups like Mrs. Butterworth's, by all means, stock up: customers can buy Butterfield's syrup to take home.  I end my review on a lighter note: those of you who know me also are familiar with my occasional lapses into East Coast snobbery when I ridicule the Midwest. (Four years in Chicago for college: I think I paid my dues.)  My friend Kerry, a proud Michiganian, always sticks up for her regional plot during these times.  Sitting at this restaurant, which apparently hails from the Chicagoland area, she mumbled, \"I hate to say this . . . I *really* hate to say this . . . but this place is so Midwestern.  Ugh.\"  Hearing this pejorative remark brightened me up and almost made up for the subpar pancakes.  Almost.",

Mom got the apple pancake and I decided to skip my usual go-to dish (veggie omelet) and try the veggie hash. It was really tasty and seriously filled me up all damn day! Instead of poached eggs on top, I opted for scrambled egg whites. Mom loved her apple pancake, stating that it had significantly more apples than what she normally gets at the OPH. She claimed that it was only slightly inferior to the one she normally gets at the OPH but was still highly impressed. My only complaint was that the wait time on the apple pancake was about 30 minutes, when in reality ours came out about in about an hour.",

    "text": "Butterfield's Blows.  My hubby and I were in Scottsdale for a wedding, and this place was highly recommended to us. When we got there, there were so many people waiting outside that we were sure we were in for a treat! Oh were we wrong! First of all, the wait was twice as long as they said it would be, and when we finally went and bugged the hostess, she said they had already paged us. Rather than apologizing, she made it out to be our fault, although we'd been clutching the stupid vibrator the whole time.  It was super busy, so I was willing to overlook that, and also the fact that our waitress never even slowed down or made eye contact while serving us... IF the food had been good. But it wasn't at all. I had the worst hash browns I've ever had in my life. They were dripping in oil, but oddly had no flavor at all. How hard is it to make hash browns? The California egg scramble was passable, but nothing special either. The blueberry pancakes tasted just like Denny's or IHOPS. Fine, but so not worth the hype, long wait, and extra price tag.  Basically, the food was NO DIFFERENT than a breakfast chain like IHOP or Denny's. And you don't need to wait an hour there. I guess a bonus is that unlike Denny's, you can leave Butterfield's without smelling like cooking grease. That's about it.",

Perhaps I ordered the wrong items, but as a diabetic I didn't take the chance on a whole stack o'pancakes, which looked great on others' plates. Instead I ordered the \"bacon waffle\" [yeah, call me a health nut] which was described as having bacon in the batter.  Mine had a strip crumbled on top, but if bacon was also hidden in the waffle I couldn't find it.  A few last thoughts:  My friend said his cinnamon bread french toast was a-ok. Service was fast, if not cheerful (reminded me of my civil service co-workers); they had a decent sugar-free syrup for me (yay!) and the decor was great.   Would definately go back and give it another go ... loved the flying pancake mural in the waiting area and the waffle light fixtures ... but I may just stick to JP Pancake instead ...",

    "text": "Don't you love those lazy morning that spill over into lazy afternoons, when you don't leave the house 'til around 11am, and your body still wants breakfast even though it's lunch time?  After catching a movie the wife and I flipped through my \"to try\" bookmarks and decided to give Butterfield's a spin. We had no idea we had another SOLID breakfast spot close to our side of town!  Even though it is a pancake house (such a delicious mortgage), we ordered the Mexicana omelette with jalapeno jack cheese, and the Corned Beef Hash Skillet. The food came out FAST even though they were real busy, and being real hungry, we were real grateful. The Corned Beef Hash Skillet was real tasty... Had it been my order I would have asked for it to be extra well done, but my wife was more than happy with all the hash browns, green peppers, onions and ample amounts of hash and eggs. The omelette was stuffed with chorizo and fresh avocado, and was moist, fluffy and just spicy enough. On the side came a short stack of a couple pancakes, and after taking one bite I instantly regretted ordering an omelette (after all, it's not an omelette house, is it?). The pancakes were real cake-y, with crisp outsides, and next visit I'm definitely ordering a full stack of their specialty. I'm gonna be fat, and I'm gonna be happy, and I'm gonna be fat and happy!  I don't know why I overlooked this place for so long... There are really only a couple of decent breakfast spots in the North of the valley, and I think maybe I just discounted it as not being anything special. I also initially thought it was a chain like Baker's Square or something, but looking online I only see 4 locations throughout the US. Seriously, Butterfield's offers quick friendly service, SOLID food, and a big bang for your buck.",

They make a great cup of coffee and the fresh squeezed orange juice is great. I ordered the California scramble, it was phenomenal, the eggs were cooked perfectly and the portion as huge.

The chorizo was well-seasoned and not too greasy.  I appreciate that they have the options of egg whites or Egg Beaters, although I dislike the up-charge!  But you can't put a price on health (says the woman eating chorizo and hash browns).  The fresh-squeezed orange juice was delicious.  Portions are huge here.  Supposedly the skillets have two eggs, but I think I got more like 4, and the scramble at another table looked like it had about six.  Even though the place was full, the service was excellent.

    "text": "I like to think I know my breakfast spots, I have been to a ton of them in the area. I have gone to this place twice and both times left horribly disappointed.   The first time I ordered eggs and I also tried the pancakes. The eggs were actually the worst I have had in a few years. The pancakes were very dry. The only reason I went back is because I live close and I did not try their signature item, the oven baked pancake.....  ....which requires 30 minutes to be cooked. So after waiting 50-60 minutes for a freaking pancake I realized I was right the first time I came here. Not only was there nothing special about my order, but it wasn't any good. If the pancake was good it would have made up for the wait, but it didn't.   I am not knocking anyone else, but I think people who really enjoyed this place just need to get out to some other breakfast spots.",

They were packed, but we were seated within 5 minutes.  Service was extremely fast.  After being seated, the waitress took our order within 3 minutes and the food arrived within 7-10 minutes.  Portions were very small--not at all what I remembered from Chicago.  The wife had the spinach & gruyere crepe--not all that bad, but nothing all that great either.  I had the Southern Benedict.  Very, very small.  Everything tasted processed.  The grits were more of a paste--not home-made.  The steel-cut Scottish oatmeal was not made from steel-cut oats.  Final damages--$27 for two, so not so bad.  Both of us got sick on the way home.  Won't be going back.  I can see it is very popular (as are the Chicago locations) but I don't want to pay for reconstituted Restaurant Depot meals.  Hopefuly, their famous pancakes aren't of the same quality, but we're not going back to find out.",

I was told to expect a long wait, but was surprised to be seated within ten minutes of walking in. The menu was intense, a lot of choices to choose from especially when your stomach is rumbling.  Settled on the farmers scramble, and ordered a bacon waffle on the side to share. The scramble was perfect. My over medium eggs were spot on. Non of that runny egg white crap. The hash browns were golden and crispy. Mixed with the egg yolk, made the perfect breakfast. This scramble was loaded with ham, sausage and bacon, mushrooms, tomatoes, broccoli and onions, and lets not forget the half pound of melted cheddar and jack on top!   I thought it couldn't get better until I moved on to the bacon waffle! I can't even begin to write about the greatness of this waffle. I just recommend that you order it!

    "text": "Corporate chain restaurants aren't usually places I visit often, and when I do I generally have much scrutiny and suspicion. I know that might sound bad but I have good reason, Ive been burnt way to many times. Ive dealt with horrible service, unimaginative food and the whole annoying corporate shtick, complete with high chairs and screaming unmanageable children. Please don't get me wrong, Ive had similar disasters at locally owned restaurants, but knowing I'm keeping my hard earned money in the community makes that brutally shrieking kid a little less bothersome.  The North Scottsdale location of Butterfield's caught me off guard. I was all primed to dislike everything, but was surprised with a few of the dishes and the service was fast, efficient, and well, annoyingly friendly. How anyone can be that chipper at 7:30am is beyond me.  Being a small national chain, only 4 location, they are complete with lame corporate shtick. Look up in the massive dining room and you'll see pictures of buttered and syrup laden waffles on the ceiling. Then there's the behemoth menu complete with \"Egg-ceptional\" Eggs and \"Egg-cellent\" Specialties, I wonder who makes this stuff up? I suppose some will find this clever.  With such a huge menu it took a few minutes to try to find the unique and interesting dishes. Started out with the Dutch Baby ($7.25); a large oven baked pancake that's finished with lemon juice, powdered sugar and optional syrup. The texture is light and airy comparable to a crepe with a crisp edge. Order this upon sitting, it could take up to 30 minutes to make depending on how busy the restaurant is.  Biting into something heartier, The Bacon and Onion Skillet ($7.95) was well portioned for the low price tag. Crispy hashbrowns, bacon, grilled onions, 2 eggs with your choice of cheese and bread, was simple and satisfying.  Butterfield's originates from Illinois, so I should have given the Mexican Egg Burrito ($8.25) a little more thought before ordering. A whole wheat tortilla with chorizo, eggs and cheese, then in little plastic cups were sides of tasteless guacamole and salsa. Maybe in Illinois this is considered good but here in the land of Mexican food, it was a complete failure.  Sticking with the classics is a good idea, like the Country Benedict ($7.95). Perfectly cooked sausage patties on country biscuits then topped with eggs and country gravy. Though really, pretty much anything with pork and or egg yolks is going to be tasty.  When ordering try not to change your selection to much, it's $.75 for every substitution you make. For instance, the Popeye Scramble ($7.95) comes with monterey jack cheese but to have feta instead as well as yellow onions, added $1.50 to the bill. I mean really, scrambled eggs for close to $10 just doesn't make any sense.  Scrutiny and suspicion aside, with so many breakfast choices out there Butterfield's isn't necessarily the best option, but if you're looking for a change up, this might be something different.",

    "text": "Not bad. Not great. Just A-OK!  Stopped in for breakfast one day while we were in the area. Restaurant is currently being remodeled so the decor was nice in some parts and not so nice in other parts. No biggie. There's lots of seating so the wait isn't too bad, even when you see a crowd standing inside by the hostess stand and outside on the benches.  Staff are all nice and friendly. Service is quick, which is a plus. There's a relatively large selection of hot tea so if you're a tea drinker like me, it's nice. Menu is pretty large but we opted for safer entrees.  I had the veggie omelet with no cheese. It was pretty simple in flavor but light and fluffy. Grits are very rich, very heavy, and very good, but if you're watching your calories, I would skip it as they're probably made with heavy cream. Pancakes are a little dry but nice. Husband had the two egg special (scrambled) with bacon. Bacon was pretty crispy, and the hash browns were crispy and kind of scalloped style - plain flavor, but good. I would opt for the hash browns in the future.  I like the the table has a bunch of condiments for all your needs - Tabasco sauce, maple syrup, ketchup, and everything in between. Prices are reasonable for what you get. If I'm in the area again during breakfast time, I'll probably make another stop in.",

    "text": "I had my first visit at butterfields Scottsdale.    I witnessed the manager berate a busboy in the front of a busy house while the poor busboy was working frantically.    I was so shocked!!  This all happened right at the table in Front of us.   I actually asked him why he didn't wait until the employee was in back.  He started arguing with me at the register.   He yelled what business is it of mine  and told me to leave.    I told him that yelling at his employee in the middle of the resteraunt and right next to my table did ruin my meal.    He didnt care nor did he even comprehend that yelling at an employee in front of house is idiotic for any manager to do.     I will never be back and will let everyone  I know here in Scottsdale about the ordeal I witnessed .    The Manager was Ted and refuse to give me his last name.    This guy needs an ego check and to tell a customer to leave is a horrific  way to do business.    I own my own business and have been in a director /VP role for over 30 years and I have never witness anything like this nor have I been told to leave by a manager..  I gave it 2 stars just for the sweet waitress and the ok food.  There is too much good competition here in Scottsdale/phoenix area to put up with a nasty manager  at a resteraunt.  Edit: Upon  reading other reviews (not recommended section)  I am not the first person that the manager was rude and condescending to. The seems to be a major point with customers here.  Update 7/16/15: I sent an email  on the Chicago  corporate site soon after my review.  They have yet to contact the me.   I guess they really don't care how the manager treats his customers. (or his employees).",

The sense of urgency (to be seated, take order, etc) was there (as they rushed us through every bit of our visit) but with no individuality or customer service. Autopilot.   First, we are shown to a table that is not ready for us and we are left standing in the middle of the dining room. Very awkward. Then the waitress asks us what we would like to drink. Coffee for him, coffee for me and.....had to get her to stop the robot talk (and almost flag her down as she walked away) so I could order an OJ. Since it was our 1st time, we took a bit of time to decide what to eat. The open menu on the table with my face buried in it should have been the first clue I wasn't ready to order. But the robot-server came by 3 times ready to write everything down; and I mean everything, spelled out and repeated as she wrote. Wow...   The food was OK. A little on the bland side, but tasty. The chorizo was very flavorful and the sausage gravy was excellent. The menu is extensive with something for everyone - French toast, crepes, pancakes, skillets, specialties and more). The food came out very fast which was good because we were hungry!   Maybe my expectations were too high in general. I truly thought this place would have been nicer. If I want my check delivered to me in the middle of my meal, I would have eaten at Denny's. I was shocked and surprised.",

    "text": "NEVER GOING BACK...  What do you mean no more Dutch Baby Pancake??   We drove over 50 miles to go to one of our favorite breakfast places & as a treat we always order the Dutch Baby Pancake.  After waiting 30 minutes for a table we brushed off by the waitress after asking to order this BUTTERFIELD'S SPECIAL...  \"Oh we don't serve THAT anymore...\"   We were so shocked that we thought she was kidding!!   After going back & forth, we kept asking why & she just left & sent over the asst manager.  He simply stated they were constantly getting burned & made a management decision to discontinue the BUTTERFIELD'S TRADITION!!!   For Christ sake they have a half page write up in the Arizona Republic boasting about their specialized Dutch Baby Pancakes!!!   When we stated we'd NEVER had a burnt one nor had we ever remembered having to wait any extraordinary time for the cooks to make another one... always within 15 minutes of ordering we would get it, without fanfare!!   This Asst. Mgr was so indifferent to our complaint that one of my kids said, \"I guess we'll have to go to the Original Pancake House to get this pancake\".   Then the Asst. Mgr piped up & shot down this comment by saying, \"Oh, but their food is terrible & I've heard, VERY UNCLEAN!!\"   I was stunned!!   Neither my wife or I could think of anything to say to that & the asst mgr then turned & left.  I cannot believe a professional restaurant manager would stoop to such tactics... we've been to the Original Pancake House & LOVE their food, especially their swedish pancakes.  The Dutch Baby is a bit better at Butterfield's but to have the audacity to speak of another competitor restaurant as being UNCLEAN, is unforgiveable... we never found this restaurant in any less than stellar cleanliness!!  I'm sure the Original Pancake House would not be very happy to hear of this assistant manager slandering their restaurant!!   Upon leaving we asked the hostess just when was the dutch baby pancake discontinued?  She immediately went & got the General Manager.   He was of little additional help, other than clarifying & contradicting his OWN Asst. Manager!!  He said the pancake was taken off the menu just 6 days prior to us coming. When we said that we heard this was because the Dutch Baby's were getting burned & waste... we said, \"Maybe you need to get a good cook!\"   He looked at us puzzled & said, \"They weren't burned... it just takes too long to make!!\"   WHAT??... NEEDLESS TO SAY... I WON\"T BE BACK!!!",

    "text": "When my wife's friend mentioned she would be choosing Butterfield's for her Saturday morning brunch, I figured the place would be decent. After several visits, I can honestly say I hope I never go to another breakfast restaurant.   When you arrive at the restaurant, be prepared for a wait. The bigger the party, the longer the wait so I always recommend traveling in small groups or calling ahead (note: I haven't the slightest clue if they will even allow you to do so but it's worth a shot). Weekends will have the longest wait (obviously) however the time spent waiting makes the food even better.  On the most important topic, I have to say that I had an amazing omelet served with hash browns and pancakes. I had to do a double take on the omelet because of the shear size of it. No joke, it must have been 4 inches tall. My first omelet was graced with bacon and two types of cheese. With an omelet like this, the add-ins are not scarce. You can almost guarantee that each mouthful will be filled with all your choices. I know my mouth was. They have fresh squeezed orange juice and plenty of other tasty beverages available.   I can't wait to return to try out other menu items. I recommend this place to all family/friends who visit my family for a great breakfast. Just be sure to get there early!",

We go here almost every single weekend for breakfast, and not once have we had a less than stellar meal; and we've tried just about every damn thing on the menu.  If you go here... ASK FOR WILLIE!!!!! Willie is probably the best breakfast waiter we've ever had... he's always on top of everything, but best of all he's got a contagious happy attitude. If you go there and have him as waiter, It's nearly impossible to leave without a smile on your face. After having him only a couple times, he had already memorized what we order. Now we specifically ask for his section, because I think as diners it's our responsibility to reward good wait staff... it can make all the difference in the world when it comes to your dining experience.

I went expecting the worst with a contingency plan for everything and instead was left not wanting it to end!  This is a small family chain from chicago.  I think so many people from Chi town come to AZ that someone went home one time after being in AZ and told the owner to open one in AZ to service all the Bulls & Bears snowbirds!  I'm glad they did.  Look it's not high end french cuisine, but it's damn good family style food.",

I think I've always purchased breakfast here- they are only open till 3pm-but a friend ordered a french dip sandwich today that looked amazing and huge! So I may be a non breakfast diner next visit. The OJ is fresh squeezed, the veggies in the eggs fresh and crisp, and the pancakes cooked to perfection. The only minor issue I have is there is an upcharge for Vermont Maple Syrup vs. the standard high fructose corn syrup.",

I ordered the Mexican Burrito - scrambled eggs, chorizo, green pepper, tomato, onion, jack and cheddar in a flour tortilla.  I had them add a ladle of their chile verde verde sauce over the top.  Served with your choice of potatoes, grits, or fruit.  I selected the hash browns.    The burrito was well made, filled me up, and was large without being too big with a lot of wasted food.

When my mother was with us they could always accommodate her walker without a problem.  Tip: they have a deal where one day a month you can buy gift cards and get a bonus value added to the card. I think it's buy $100 and get $25 added to the card or something like that. So dad loads his card up once a month when the deal is on.

I have always wanted to try this place but it is kind of far from our house and I hate long waits on the weekends. This place is nearby our obstetrician's office and we go on weekdays, so it isn't so bad. It still gets pretty busy on the weekdays but no horrendous wait.  The omelettes are to die for. They are so incredibly fluffy and tasty. The home fries are unique, seasoned perfectly, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.   I would recommend getting the pancakes as your bread side to your egg dish. You can upgrade to their specialty pancakes for a couple more bucks. I'm picky with pancakes but these are sublime.   Service is always very friendly, never had a problem.  I guess it is a good thing Butterfields is too far from our house to be going on a regular basis. I would be going all the time and packing on the pounds!!",

The owner, Danny, stopped to chat with us and recommended the Berry Pancakes, which were amazing!!  The pancakes were light and fluffy and surprisingly not too sweet, Danny said they use mascarpone cheese in the topping and let me tell you they were just delicious. The food is great quality and all of the servers are friendly and knowledgeable.  I would highly recommend Butterfield's and one of their other three locations, Butters.",

I'm like no thank you, you just spoiled my appetite and left immediately. I had already ordered, all was good until this.  Needs a Dale Carnegie course or at least a lesson on manners.

Apparently this is the first time I've ever had fresh squeezed OJ and let me tell you I am now ruined for life!!! Well worth the $5 and change for a glass!!

We arrived around 9:30AM on a Tuesday, and missed the morning rush. However, the place was still packed with folks digging in to a variety of delicious breakfast platters.   Service was quick and friendly, and our coffee hit the table almost instantly. Yay!   Now for the food: I opted for a New Mexico skillet, home fried potatoes packed with chorizo, onion, green pepper, tomato, avocado, and a jack & cheddar cheese mix. I topped that off with two eggs (over easy for me), and chose a side of pancakes. It was fantastic. My better half went for Wildberry Bliss Crepes and almost didn't offer me a bite, so it's fair to say that she was happy with her choice.   With the amount of menu choices, quality of their food, great service, and reasonable prices, I think that we'll be back soon!",

My wife had the Swedish cakes which she really enjoys and always seems to order. I had the Create your own omelette; sausage mushrooms and jack cheese with hash browns and pancakes. Delicious, the omelette was light and fluffy; the hash browns were cooked nice and crispy on the outside and moist in the middle. The pancakes were also light and cooked just perfectly.

They don't take reservations so you must be prepared to wait and make time. Highly recommend to anyone. They have single handedly ruined 99% of all other pancakes and breakfast restaurants for me world wide. My favorite are the cinnamon pancakes. They have perfect syrup. And to top it all off, their orange juice is freshly squeezed on a per glass basis. Amazing. Most of their eggs are great, however the eggs Benedict needs some work. I think its probably the hollandaise sauce they need to tweak. So for that I want to give them four stars. Otherwise it would be a five stars hands down. Can't wait to come here solo or with the family again! Never gets old. Great atmosphere.",

Not really a pancake person, but they were very good, along with their own syrup.  Yes two sides crazyyyyyyy. Hope they never change that, because next visit it will be two cheesy grits for my side. Lol. The scrambler was also excellent, took the balance of it home and one pancake. $13.50 without tip. All employees wonderful also.",

I'm not sure, but I think they've expanded the menu, meaning there were plenty of things that sounded awesome for me to decide on. So yesterday I had the Strawberries & Cream Belgian Waffle. I gotta say... it was damn good. Exceeded my expectations in fact. One thing I hate about ordering breakfast with whipped cream, is it's usually the light aerosol can stuff that melts into a pool of liquid about a minute after set in front of you. Not the case here! As you can see, they use heavy whipped cream, and lots of it. The strawberries were very fresh and ripe. It was really perfect. Price was not terrible either.",

Appears to be a place enjoyed by the locals, as the crowd on a Sunday morning at 10am was rather long, but well worth it.  Our service was fantastic and got our food to us very quickly.  I ordered the bacon and eggs and chose grits and pancakes as my side.  I opted for the bananas foster pancakes, which literally tasted like banana cream pie (phenomenal).  My wife ordered an omelet and had the berry pancakes as her side, which she absolutely loved.  The prices are very reasonable and portions are huge.  We were stuffed from lunch and it held us over until a reasonably late dinner.",

The scramble took up 1/2 the plate and crispy hashbrowns took up the other half.  Who's complainin'?  I'm not!  The restaurant was nice & clean and the service was really good even with how busy they were.  The only drawback was the place was a little too noisy for me.

Our party included my 90 year old Mother on a walker, as well my sister, her husband and their 17 year old son. My nephew ordered a Panini which was very small, my sister ordered some crepes which she felt were not very good, my brother in law and I ordered a Denver Omelette which I was going to split with my Mother. When everything came my omelette was not fluffy and generous like my brother in laws.  Mine was small, dry and with hardly any vegetables. When our server came back she said it would do no good for her to complain to the cook or the management, because they wouldn't listen to her and it needed to come from me. She then said she had many similar complaints from customers throughout that week about their omelettes. So when I received the bill I went to see the manager and he met me with an attitude like \"why are you bothering me\". I explained to him what we had ordered and told him there was a significant quality control problem with his omelettes and that I thought he would like to know.  I thought as a courtesy, I would let him know that he had a food quality problem that his server confirmed. He immediately said that our server never would have said that, and there is nothing wrong with our omelettes or anything else coming out of our kitchen. He as much as called me a liar, so I asked him for his card or at least his name, and he refused and told me if I didn't leave the restaurant he would escort me out and call the police, all because I asked him for his name or card.  I said I'm more than happy to leave the restaurant, but I have to pay the bill, however because you have verbally threatened me twice I am going to make this incident very public.  He at the point informed me that he was also an owner... all the more reason why he should want to hear customer's comments (I was told by another waitress that his name was Chris). He followed me back to the table and proceeded to threaten my 90 year old mother, my 17 year old Nephew and his parents who didn't even know about our discussion, that if they didn't leave the restaurant he was calling the police! This man's actions were despicable and unprofessional and left my family stunned and appalled.   My question is, why would anyone consider going to this restaurant when a manager/owner is disrespectful to his customers and frightens his employees.",

    "text": "I love butterfield's and my family and I go there every sunday to go eat breakfast. But the only problem is the girls that work up in the front are a little ignorant to people and for it being so early in the morning not a lot of people really want to deal with that. One time my mom asked the girl if she could borrow a pen the girl looked at her said she didn't have one yet they had a whole bunch of pens in a holder....gee..what great service. The waiters are great!!! they always are on top of their game and of course since we are regulars they love to talk to us. We have told them about the girls but I think this is a perfect way to put them on blast! If you are working at a place that considers great customer service (obviously everywhere) then fake a smile and put that nasty attitude away. Being rude is not good customer service. Other than that go to Butter Fields! they have the best food of course :)",

They serve up all the tasty morning classics, like pancakes, belgian waffles, eggs, omelets, etc. But they also offer slight variations by making them with fresh fruit.    The portions are huge too, so you'll probably end up with leftovers.  It gets pretty busy in there on the weekends, so you might end up waiting 20 minutes or so.    If you've been wanting to try a new breakfast spot, this is it!",

I even called the restaurant to see if they would still make it even tho not on the menu. The answer was an emphatic  \"no\". Will not be going back. You can get the usual breakfast items everywhere, ie. pancakes, omelets, etc. but the Baked Apple Pancake was unique.",

The most recent time I've been, I noticed that a couple of the hostess girls were a bit unfriendly - I like to see a smiling face early in the morning. Luckily, at 8 on a Saturday we only had to wait 5 minutes. But, our waitress was very, very nice. I think this must be personal preference, because many love their pancakes, but I don't really like them much. They seem dry - I've definitely had better pancakes. BUT, their fresh squeezed orange juice is to die for! Delicious. All and all, a nice place to have breakfast occasionally.",

    "text": "Wow. So I went since this place got such high scores from others. I never thought much of this place from the outside. I passed it a number of times and just wrote it off as another corny breakfast place, like all that came before and went out of business in that same location. I walked in this morning and immediately appreciated the decor... just look at the lights when you go in. Lights hanging from waffles complete with a pad of butter. You can't beat it. The menu was full of yummy things... I have a list of what I want to get on future visits. Today I decided upon a spinach and feta omelette with potatoes (crunchy hash browns) and two pancakes. Mmm... lots of carbs. I didn't feel so bad since I had noticed the \"pancakes made with whole grain flour\" on the menu. Awesome. Yeah, the whole breakfast was $7.50. And then OJ- they have a machine that squeezes the oranges right in front of you. It's on the back wall and you watch them throw in oranges and see the delicious nectar drip right into the pitcher that fills your glass (fills, but probably not refills). Next time I'll try the Baby Apple baked pancakes... or the Lemon Poppy seed french toast with blueberry compote... or maybe one of the fantastic looking skillets... or maybe...  Update: I tried the Baby Apple pancake. Wow. It was totally worth the wait. The pancake is big enough for two. It was thick with gooey apple goodness and warm cinnamon yummiliciousness.  PS I have added this to my Greek list because three awesome (read: handsom and friendly) Greek brothers run it. To cater to the Greek community, on Sunday afternoons they offer Avgolemono soup, a Greek chicken, rice, and lemon soup. It's not on the menu. Opa!",

The food was decent, although my scrambled eggs were a little hard.  The link sausage was fine, not a ton of flavor.  Go for the bacon, it's thick and crispy, the big winner of the morning.  The coffee is also decent compared to most diner coffee. The pancakes were pretty thick and dense.  Maybe it was because we didn't order designer pancakes or scrambles but you should be able to be good at simple scrambled eggs if you tout all that other stuff.",

Picture Original Pancake House (from whom many of the menu items ie Apple Pancake, German Pancake, etc were borrowed) but with higher quality ingredients, fresh squeezed juice, and killer coffee.  The kicker is they serve the coffee with heavy cream rather than half and half.  In the land of strip malls that is Scottsdale this place is a stand out.  Haven't tried the original outposts in Chicago's Western Suburbs but if I am ever forced to go back to Naperville I definitely will.",

They cook the bacon into the waffle right in the old waffle iron:)  Well...next to a bacon filled old fashioned donut, this may the closest we get to a perfect ten in \"food combinations/breakfast division\":)  The Beautiful Carin and I needed a little sustenance on Sunday morning and found ourselves reasonably close to Butterfields (actually, we were right down the street from the Breakfast Club, but who needs that cluster:)  We hadn't been to Butterfields for several months and the time was ripe for \"revisit\" so I could \"score the review\":)  I'm pretty glad we did!  Summertime is probably a better time to get your Butterfields fix...on a Sunday in January the wait gets a little crazy...north of an hour with a line of Dame Edna lookalikes standing at the counter asking if their table is ready because they're sure they felt their pager go off...it didn't really go off...just the friction of Teflon against titanium in their hip replacements every time they shift their considerable bulk:)  This past Sunday, the wait at 12:30 was zero minutes:)  Butterfields is technically a \"chain\"...three locations separated from each other by thousands of miles...they don't feel like a chain:)  They have a bunch of nice touches at Butterfields...a big mechanical juicer where they feed crates of oranges in the top and fresh juice comes out the bottom...heavy cream for the coffee (a truly delightful \"bloom\" of cream when you pour it in the coffee:), Vermont maple syrup and other nice, high quality touches:)  The menu runs from a selection of Benedict's (including the Bubba, with gravy and sausage instead of Canadian Bacon and Hollandaise) to a selection of assorted Dutch Babies and Apple pancakes.  I've tried a bunch of these tasty little treats and they are serious health food (by which I mean that if you eat here too often, you will need to see your healthcare professional...seriously:)  But, back to the aforementioned Waffle...you order that, a side of sausage, two sunnyside up eggs ( which you slide onto your buttered waffle)...syrup the whole thing and eat until the pee stick says you're approaching a diabetic coma:)  Carin had a nice breakfast, too!   Some sort of omelet!   She said it was good, but I forget anything else after the sugar shock took me down:)",

    "text": "Always on a search for a good breakfast.  When I think breakfast, I think country restaurants that cater to farmers and ranchers - where the next meal might be a late dinner.  Three or four plates to hold all the food, and a 70 year old waitress that calls everybody \"honey\" or \"sweetheart\".  And hash browns that are home-made, not frozen, with a choice of different gravies. This is not one of those restaurants.   Butterfield's, to me, is very similar to other franchised breakfast chains.  The food is better than a Denny's or IHOP, and there is a little larger selection.  In fact, the menu is massive, and I'm sure anyone could find something that would pique their interest.  But the most memorable thing about my breakfast here was the fresh squeezed orange juice, which was delicious.  It is huge restaurant and plenty of room for seating.  Both times that I was here was early on a weekday morning, so there was no line.  We have heard from others that on weekends the line is lengthy, but we never have had to wait.  And the service was great.  Other than that, the food at our table, and we had four people eating, was uninspiring and average.  We had pancakes, waffles, omelettes, a scramble, bacon, ham, sausage, almost a taste of everything. And nothing stood out.    So I will keep looking.  I know in a metropolitan area as big as Phoenix, there has to be a country restaurant specializing in breakfasts.  And when I find it, I'll let everyone know.",

This place is hands-down the best breakfast place in the valley, and short of getting a $30 breakfast at a swanky resort, it isn't even close.     I'll start by saying that when you order coffee, they bring you REAL CREAM for it.   Do you know how long it's been since I've seen a breakfast place bring me real cream?  So long that I had to check to make sure it wasn't spoiled half & half.  It makes their already good coffee taste awesome.    Next, they have actual thick cut bacon, not the pre-packaged strips you'll find at Denny's..  I'm drooling just thinking about it.    Everything I've had off their griddle (french toast, belgian waffles, crepes) have been awesome.  If you get the chance and you're hankering something sweet, get their taffy apple french toast.  I think they put me in a sugar coma, but it's soooo good.  Tons of apples, caramel, pecans, other things I don't really remember cause I kinda blacked out.  Oddly enough, though I haven't had them myself, I've heard the pancakes were less than spectacular- crumbly and overdone was the description a friend gave  Strange for what would seem to be their signature dish.  I'll chalk it up to a one-time error.    Also, can anyone explain why I find the need to order eggs for breakfast?  For some reason, it just doesn't feel like a breakfast meal unless there are eggs present, but I only ever eat like half of them.   I don't even really like them.  That's not really related to the review, just kinda throwing it out there.",

    "text": "It was Boxing Day and I didn't want to settle on plain ol' hotel breakfast food.  I wanted to go somewhere special before I depart from this beautiful city.  Good thing I did my homework before coming to Arizona for vacation!  Or else I would have missed out of Butterfield's Pancake House!    It was packed and busy when we arrived.  I was surprised to see that they only open until 3PM.  We were promptly seated and handed menus.  There are so many choices, they all sounded so good.  My mother thought if each of us ordered something, it would've been too much.  But I said.. Mom.. This is probably a once in a lifetime breakfast at Butterfield's.  We have to make it a great one!  So we ended up ordering four meals:  California Scramblers with pancakes, Denver Omelette with English Muffin, Farmer Skillet with Biscuit, a Crab Cake Sandwich, and two cups of orange juice.  When the food came, I was impressed.  Not only was the food appealing to the eye, but it also tasted delicious!  There was a whole lot of food!  So much that we could not finish.  The orange juice was one of the sweetest I've ever had.  It makes me think they added sugar in it but I doubt it.  The only downside is that it is quite pricey for a breakfast meal.  Maybe if you count it a brunch then its okay.  Or maybe we just over ordered.  ($50 for breakfast yikes!)  Regardless of the price, I would still come here often for a satisfying breakfast meal and delicious orange juice.",

I have gone early in the morning when there hasn't been a wait, mid morning where you are waiting upwards of 30 mins or more and after 1pm when again there is no wait. All in all, I enjoy Butterfields for breakfast and so far I have not had a bad meal. I hope that streak continues :)",

I had heard nothing but great things about this place, so it was worth a shot.  After seeing how reasonable the prices were I was afraid we had just stepped into a fancy IHOP.  I'm glad to say  I was wrong.  The California Omlette was great, though the pancakes on the side seemed a little off.  But I chalk that up to trying to stuff them down my gullet after I was already stuffed by the rest of my meal.  It was a Friday morning so there was no wait, but I can clearly see why it would be packed on the weekends!",

I love their Eggs Benedict and the tasty hollandaise sauce, the Dutch Baby pancake is delicious, my friends have loved the waffles and pancakes as well. There are lots of condiments on the table for those who like to spice up their food. The coffee is smooth and their restaurants are always impeccably clean.  Highly recommend!",

We were told it would be 30minutes which was perfectly fine as we assumed a big party (we did not want 2 separate tables as we had family in town) would have a bit of a wait. After watching tables of 4-5 get seated ahead of us and a 30min wait turning into an hour wait was very upsetting.  We asked if 2 tables could be put together and were told no (this was after our wait of an hour) as the 2 tables were different servers. A large group came in about 15mins before we were sat and they got seated about 5mins after we did. The waitress was subpar and other waitresses were refilling the coffees. The reason this is get higher stars is because the food is delicious but was hard to enjoy after waiting and watching a ton of people be seated. I wish thing would have gone differently because we loved the food and coffee.",

Decided to have breakfast here for the first time since it was recommended by my colleague. After reading through their simple, yet extensive list of breakfast foods of pancakes, crepes, benedicts, waffles, scrambles, breakfast burritos and sides. I decided on getting the simple Blueberry Pancakes with a side of Corned Beef Hash. She ordered the Wildberry Crepes with a side of Hash Browns.  The food came out pretty fast, so it was timely and the food looked absolutely pleasant and almost fake how well presented it looked. The pancakes were soft, fluffy and with a blueberry sauce that was sweet and slightly tart. The sauce didn't entirely douse the pancakes either, so I liked that. The pancakes tasted so good, it's good enough to eat on it's own! Butterfield's is definitely on it's pancake A game. I tried a bit of my friend's crepe that was topped with berry sauce, whip and stuffed with cream. So delicious, not super sweet and definitely a treat to please one with a sweet tooth however. I liked my Corned Beef Hash, definitely less greasy with finer pieces of potato but was a good contrast with my sweet pancakes.  The service was great, our server was attentive and did frequent checks despite the busy morning. The place itself is so open, modern and clean. Definitely a more sophisticated version of your typical breakfast spot. Their menu has a good variety and have gluten free and protein options. The pricing may be a bit steeper than other places, but for the quality of food, service and atmosphere it's totally worth it!",

Keep in mind that this place is a \"snow bird\" hot spot during the winter months and the wait can run quite long. Their Shea location was also just remodeled last year (or so) bringing a fresh and more modern feel.   My wife pretty regularly orders her ultimate favorite: the Swedish Pancakes. I don't like any type of pancake so I don't get the attraction, but she raaaaaaaaves about them. They are very thin and cooked well with a Lingonberry sauce on top.  My standard Turkey Club sandwich never disappoints. Buttered and toasted wheat bread, cheddar cheese, thick cut bacon, quality sliced turkey, lettuce, tomato and mayo. I've yet to have the French fries because every time I ask for them to sub their out of this world hash browns. They freshly slice their potatoes and cook them up with tons of crunchy hash brown goodness mixed throughout. Never need to ask for them well done here ;-).  This place is soooo far above the usual breakfast chain joints in terms of quality, you can't even compare them. They are in a tier all their own and I already can't wait to go back!",

They've abandoned them in favor of hash browns, which of course you can find anywhere.  I spoke to the manager, who happened to be part of the ownership.  He was obviously the kind of person who loves to hear positive feedback only.  All he did when I told him that I was disappointed in the change was continually try to sell me on \"the fact\"  that his restaurant was the best there is.  It was similar to talking to a used car salesman.  He really didn't want to hear anything of an even slightly negative nature, with respect to his restaurant.  I told him about a restaurant that I commonly patronize (Country Boys) that serves a fabulous breakfast at about half the price.  He virtually scoffed at what I said and spoke as though I couldn't know what I was talking about.  I do. Another thing about Butterfield's is that it's noisy as hell.  Not especially relaxing.  BTW Country Boys serves both hash browns and home fries.  This manager needs to learn a thing or two about customer service.  His attitude might best be described as \"The customer is always wrong.\"  Brian Klein",

    "text": "This place is so YUMMY! My husband and I had been on vacation 5 years ago and still remembered the experience. When we were back in AZ for an event in May, we could not remember the name of it but really wanted to find it. I scoured pancake places and thought this was it. We were so happy that it was!  The variety of wickedly decadent pancakes is great, and both times we've been (years apart) they were cooked perfectly. We were also able to order just one of this and one of that (so that we could try more than just 2 things). There were healthier options for the people in our party who had more self control.  The server was wonderful with my mother, who basically demanded coffee every time she appeared. It was clear that others were constantly bringing coffee around, but my mom didn't notice. Kudos to the employee who didn't even get cranky with her.",

    "text": "The food here is exceptional. Anyone that has ever eaten here knows that. This review is more about the service. Our server is Deana. She is the only server for us. BY FAR one of the best servers that we have ever had, in any restaurant, in any city, EVER!  Her attention to detail is unmatched. From the moment we sat down, she begin to wow us with a warm welcome. She mentioned how she almost waited on us the last time that we were in. Who remembers almost waiting on a family?  Even more impressive, is the time that she spoke of was 3 months ago!  I knew at that moment, that we were in excellent hands! She was mindful of everyone at our table, even our children. She made sure to give them plastic cups, with lids and straws, instead of glass. She made certain not to put the hot plates in front of them, and informed us that they were hot. She paused for a moment as we prayed. (We always pray at meals, home or out.) Many servers are in such a rush that they interrupt the prayer in order to hand you a napkin! Not Deana!   This review could go on an on, but I will end it with my recommendation. Go see Deana at Butterfield's. Ask for her, sit in her section, and you will feel like family. (But, don't treat her like family at tip time! Take care of servers who take care of you!) :)  Oh, yeah, the food was great too!",

    "text": "Wish I could give 4.5 stars, cuz while I reserve my 5 stars for \"blown away\" type experiences, Butterfields is worth more than the 4 stars.   Because everything was so fantastic, I'll start with the only thing that was not good. Our table shared/sampled everything and had same opinions. We ordered sides of sausage links, biscuits & gravy, and grits. While the links were great, we wouldn't order the other two items again. The grits were a weird texture, kind of like a not-fully-cooked rice pudding with a greasy cream. We like to add Tabasco, sugar, & a lil butter to our grits, but even that couldn't save the day. The biscuits felt amazing in texture with slight crisp to outside with a moist flaky interior, but the gravy was gross. Very salty and kind of like someone added a bit too much fake liquid smoke.   As for the entrees: Baked Potato Omelette added ham & jalapeno (.25 each addition, super cool) and a Veggie Omelette (added double salmon, also just .25 each!). Omelettes came with hash browns which we loved. They shave the potatoe and it comes out with all of these flavorful crispy brown edges. They also came with pancakes that we upgraded to specialty ones. OhMYGOODnESS! One was the cinnamon roll, the other was the apple cinnmon pecan caramel...on their own they were great, put them together and they were INcreDible! I meant to suggest that they put that combo on the menu, but I forgot - I will next time, because I will most definitely be back!  Our server, Stan was also great. He didn't introduce himself, but I made sure to check our receipt so that I could give him yelper kudos for a job well done. Coffee and waters were always full (small creamer cups were too). I saw teamwork amongst servers and busperson which I love to see. I was a server for a long time so I am kind of a stickler. A place can have amazing food but if service sucks, I don't usually return. Butterfields will always be high on my recommendation list for anyone looking. While I plan to try all of what looks amazing from their menu, I'm excited to return for one of their oven baked pancakes. As we were leaving, the table next to us had theirs arrive- the smell alone was heavenly & they looked delicious!",

The second time, I went for my birthday with my aunt, and I had the eggs half rojo and half verde. BEST EGGS I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!! The sauces were well blended and the scrambled eggs were fluffy and covered in cheese and sauce over a bed of black beans, avocado, more cheese, and two flour tortillas. It came with a side of their famous hash browns and I felt like I was going to explode with happiness. I will definitely be back soon, I recommend this place to all my friends and family.

It was fantastic! I had the waffle with strawberries and whipped cream. Wow! It was sooooo good. Fresh strawberries and loads of whipped cream. I'm happily in a sugar coma right now.  My companions had the country eggs Benedict, Swedish pancakes and the 2 egg breakfast. Everything looked splendid. I would definitely recommend this place!

You get one less pancake than a full order, but this way you get a little more variety to your breakfast. I asked if the pancakes would be the same size as the $10 full order of pancakes and was told that they were. I don't think they are because these were pretty small. They don't come close to filling the plate that they're on and the plate is about as big across as the fork, for reference. That said, the cinnamon roll pancakes I ordered were scrumptious and I'm glad I didn't have a bigger order because there is sooo much sugar. The eggs come with hash browns or you can substitute with a fruit cup. The fruit cup is a mix of your typical watermelon, honeydew, strawberry and blueberries but you can ask for a mix of whichever fruit you prefer. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and delicious and the berries were sweet and fresh.  The kids chocolate chip pancakes were yummy as well and the bacon was so so good. The orange juice, eggs Benedict and Dutch baby/apple baby are all amazing. Honestly, I've never had a bad meal here.",

The server came back, very quickly, but dead-eyed still, and somehow expected me to be ready to order, despite having never been able to order my coffee. Since my wife managed to get in an order for juice, she quickly had disappeared and re-appeared, pushing for an order again. I kid you not, this server was at our table 3 times in 5 minutes and never once looked at either of us nor offered a single pleasantry. I don't know her name because she never said it, nor did she say hi, or offer any help navigating the menu or basically any simple server acts short of robot-replacing garbage coffee pouring and beverage retrieval. I know of a robot that makes omelettes, so you'd better learn to communicate and treat people well.",

    "text": "First, the good. This place is light and airy, and pleasantly decorated. We were greeted promptly and seated right away. All the condiments (salt, pepper, ketchup, hot sauces, sugar and sweetener for coffee, etc.) were already on the table.  But there were issues...  Just as I remember from many years ago (when we first visited this establishment), they are NOT flexible. They basically refuse to substitute, and insist on charging you for the a separate side if you want to change anything - even minor changes that would actually SAVE them money.  This inflexibility is especially aggravating in a world where many of us are trying to reduce (not eliminate) carbohydrates. Their standard sides are very carbohydrate-rich.  I ordered my eggs over medium, and my wife ordered her eggs over easy. But the two egg servings were identical - no difference. So our waitress either didn't properly record our wishes or the kitchen failed to follow instructions. Either of these options is not acceptable.  Worst, however, was the fact that our table, although clean, had the distinct aroma of Clorox. I don't know about you, but I can't enjoy a meal when my senses are being constantly assaulted by the smell of chlorine.  In short, this place wasn't any better than IHOP and was almost twice the price.   Our waitress was pleasant, but not gracious. She did her job well, but didn't seem happy to be there.  I won't be going back soon.",

    "text": "GLUTEN FREE? If you're like me, and have no choice but to be gluten-free, then you're tired of always seeing upcharges on the bill for substituted items. Hey, it might seem unfair, but I'm sure it costs a little extra for gluten free ingredients and special handling. The frustrating thing is when they make extra money on those ingredients and handling. Even more frustrating is seeing those upcharges on your bill even though you asked the server if there were any, and were told there weren't.  Sunday was our third visit to Butterfield's (or Butter's) in three years. Of course the gluten free pancakes cost a little more, but I'm happy to pay it for GF food. I specifically asked the server, Sidney, if there were any upcharges for GF pancakes at all. She said no. Then immediately after answering that question said that the table syrup wasn't GF, and asked if I wanted GF (knowing 5 seconds prior we'd been discussing upcharges for GF orders). Well sure! In my mind pancakes are just a delivery system for the syrup.  She brought four pancakes and a little tiny container of syrup, maybe enough for one pancake. I asked for another one. After pouring them both, it was obvious that it would take two more, but I decided not to bother her again. When the bill came, each of those small GF syrups was $2. So there was an extra $4 for syrup. If I'd have asked for two more, the cost of the syrup would have exceeded the cost of the pancakes. There's absolutely no way that they weren't at least doubling the cost of the syrup. And wait, didn't I ask the server about upcharges? But that's not the only reason we won't eat there anymore. It seems that every time we eat there, I suffer from Celiac symptoms the next day. I can't believe that they aren't trying very hard to keep gluten out of the food, but it's the only thing I ate each time that I didn't fix myself that day. Look, the server showed a level of trustworthiness that I'm not comfortable with. Was that her decision, or is it an informal policy recommended by someone above her? I don't know. But now that doubt is in my mind, and I don't want to put my trust in a restaurant I have doubts about.  If you aren't required to be GF, and have no reason to expect unreasonable upcharges, then you'll like the atmosphere, that they serve breakfast well into the afternoon, and that the servers are friendly (if not completely upfront).",

Even though this place is always crazy busy they are very good at managing their wait times and getting people sat within 20-30 min. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone! Love it!",

We got an order of buttermilk pancakes and french toast, both were great and generous servings. We got an additional side of bacon and biscuits and gravy. I'm personally not a fan of sausage gravy so I didn't love that as much.   Overall, things were fine and I left with a full stomach.",

    "text": "Honestly, Butterfields (and Butters, for that matter) is the definitive breakfast restaurant. The food is top notch and consistent, as is the service. They strive to have your food to you within seven minutes of you sitting down, and I've seldom seen them miss that window even at peak hours.   Pricing is more than reasonable. You're looking at a dollar or two more than a place like iHop or Dennys, and the food and service are in completely different league.  Both Butterfields and Butters have arguably achieved the status of being a tourist destination. They're one of the places that absolutely everybody has heard of, and people visiting Scottsdale almost always make it point to visit.   While I won't claim to speak to the full merits of everything that goes into making an operation of this class, I will make one statement. The owners Chris, Teddy and George all understand a concept that is lost on many. When you run an establishment of this caliber you're no longer merely in the restaurant business, you're in the hospitality business. Pay attention to any truly great business, they all share one core quality - they all make it a point to make you feel as if you have just found a second home.   As a customer, I have felt as if I was special since the day I walked in. The trick, of course, is that they are able to create that effect for every customer that walks in the door. Judging by how packed this place always is, it's safe to say that the full extent of the experience Butterfields creates is not lost on many.",

I bit of advice is to either be early or eat at their off times.  Butterfield's is known for good food and also long waits.  On a Sat/Sun morning, you could drive by and easily see 40-50 people waiting outside (and that's just outside!).  Honestly, it is well worth the wait.  Staff is great and service is quick.",

He was very disrespectful and condescending to me when someone at out table called him out on this and asked if he could bring us more napkins he told our daughter to GET THE F___K OUT of his restaurant and he called the police on us.

I tried the Veggie Skillet and asked the waitress if perhaps the cook could minimize the green pepper (not a big fan) and when I was served this lovely meal, there was a small bowl of perfectly cooked green peppers on the side. Everything we had was delicious. The Corned Beef Hash my sister ordered was homemade and NOT from a can, making me completely jealous that I hadn't ordered it as well. My son demolished the Silver Dollar pancakes he ordered, which never usually happens.  We truly had an enjoyable meal and met the owner Chris, who was warm and hospitable. To me, the mark of great service is not only delivering what is promised, but surpassing expectations. Butterfields does this, along with with friendly and efficient service.

My husband had the Country Biscuits & Gravy and it was much lighter than this dish usually is, and the seasoning was perfectly balanced - not overdone.

This is a no fluff straight forward breakfast, but they do it right.   I love the eggs Benedict and just a straight up eggs, bacon and potato combo. Fresh OJ is a must. They are best known for pancakes and waffles but I don't like sweets, so I can't comment. My kids love them though.",

Endless tales of their impectible service and outstanding food, and after meeting a collegue of mine one early morning at this \"legendary\" spot, I can say with all certainty that what I heard does not do this wonderful establishment justice.  Walking in I was greeted with a warm smile by the hostess, while I'm never an easy riser, all displeasure with leaving my warm bed to face the day was gone when in no more than 5 minutes I was sat at a comfortable booth with a hot coffee in my hands, and my order on the way.  I ordered the Whole Hog Skillet and this glorious hot breakfast was on my table before I could finish my first cup of coffee. Speedy service with warm smiles and bright attitudes, I already felt that after this harty delicious meal I could handle anything the day had to throw at me. I knew I would need to visit this wonderland of breafast foods again, and since then each time has been greater than the last. Don't miss this incredible spot.",

So far, there's the Original Pancake House and Butterfield's, both located in Scottsdale, which is not surprising since Butterfield's is part of the Chicago suburban chain of the same name. This is a proper breakfast where we come from: a lofty pillow of aerated egg, in which is mixed your usual fixings, sliced potato hash browns round out the meal with toast and lashings of coffee. The same goes for the very crisp, perfectly turned out waffles. Service is attentive and polite and despite the geriatric vibe things are quite bustling and loud here. As a single diner was seated within 5-10m on a Saturday (there is no counter here) around 8:30AM. Highly recommend.",

So delicious, with cream drizzled on top and in between the pancakes!   The California scrambler is also a GREAT dish if you are wanting an egg breakfast!

Food was really tasty, service was fast/friendly (especially considering how busy they were), tons of choices, and prices were reasonable.

I was on vacation in the Phoenix area and my friend and I didn't discover this place until towards the end of my trip but we made sure to fit in a second visit on my last day because we loved it so much (we went to Butters Cafe the 2nd time, same quality!). First I want to say our waiter was amazing, I wish I remembered his name because he was incredibly friendly and helpful. The first trip I ordered an omelete with home fries and a side of the cinnamon roll pancakes and a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. Oh my.. The omelete was amazing but it was huge and so fluffy, once I tasted the pancakes I was too distracted and ended up taking 3/4 of the omelete home (it was still great when I reheated it later). I can't even describe these pancakes.. You know how they say no matter how much you exaggerate the Grand Canyon it still won't be enough? Well that's how I feel about these pancakes. They are unlike any pancake I've ever tried.. They are so fluffy and basically melt in your mouth and the icing/cinnamon drizzle are incredible. The second time we went I skipped the omelete just because of how big it was I didn't want to take up any space, I was there for more pancakes. The fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious as well. I'm so bummed this restaurant is not here in Pittsburgh although it's probably good it's not because I would eat here several times a week. This will definitely be one of my first stops the next time I'm in AZ!",

Servers are great at taking care of you.  The service is so fast.  We always do breakfast.  1 thing that wasn't so good, was the oatmeal.  Was oatmeal paste.  You could tell it had been sitting too long and no one was adding water to it.  The other would be the cinnamon raisin bread.  They used to have the thick Texas style cinnamon raisin bread.  Not sure how much the cost difference is, but now it is just regular bread.  The thicker was so much better.  Everything else I have tried has been very tasty.  I do not always have the same thing.  I like to try something different.  Place is always clean.  Watch the bussers, they are great.  They clean the tables, as well as, under the table to get it ready for the next customer(s).  Are always on the floor taking away the dishes that customers are done with.  And they sometimes have to deliver food for the server.   Everyone here works like a team.  Managers are not just sitting in the back somewhere.  They are on the floor helping to seat people, bring out food if needed, talking with customers.  We've even had the chef bring out food because the place was packed.  I have, and would recommend this place to everyone.  This isn't a place that you over hype, it's a nice place to go for breakfast/lunch with good food and great service.    Smile and respect the server.  They are working hard and they appreciate someone who helps make their day when it is a crazy day.",

    "text": "Overall not a bad breakfast place.  There's a few things that really stand out to me  First is the fresh squeezed orange juice.  It's hard to find fresh OJ around the valley.  Second is the look and feel of the place.  Very clean and open.  Ordered the salmon scrambler which is almost like an omelette but not quite.  Eggs came out just a tad over cooked, but the hash browns cooked perfectly and the pancakes nice and fluffy.  One thing I asked our waitress if they add any butter to the eggs, as I noticed almost like a buttery sheen on my plate.  (Trying to eat a little healthier). To my surprise there is a 1/2 ounce of butter added.  Now I know yummy taste always comes with a price but that has a way of adding calories really quick.  Will try the place again but only if they can hold the excess butter.",

They're always busy and always have a wait but definitely worth it. Food is always out in a timely manner no matter how busy.",

Prices were reasonable, portions were huge, the service was great, and the food was fantastic!! I can't say enough good things about it.  The Wildberry pancakes are awesome; the fruit was fresh and juicy, and the mascarpone inside is gooey and delicious. The pancakes themselves were fluffy and soft, pretty standard. I got the Mexicana skillet which is spicy enough to be fun but not burn your mouth off.  The unexpected standout: the grits!!! I love grits and I've eaten them a lot. These were truly the best I've ever had. They're fluffy, warm, flavorful, and creamy in the best way. Even if you don't think you like grits... try them!!! They're not grainy like most places I've tasted. So good.  Also, the coffee was surprisingly tasty. I hate black coffee but I didn't even use a sugar packet here!  I'm coming back to try everything else.",

    "text": "For being the supposed \"most important meal of the day,\" breakfast is one of those constants in life that people consistently screw up. It's like listening to Neil Diamond's \"Sweet Caroline\" and not doing the bom-bom-BOM!'s during the chorus - it's such a staple of life that screwing it up would immediately draw the ire, suspicion and potential shoulder shrugs of those around you. Fortunately, Butterfield's nails the concept of breakfast, doing so in such a way that their competition probably does not even know where to begin when it comes to matching their quality.  My folks and I stopped in here on a Friday morning and the place was hopping. When we walked in, two different hostesses greeted us and we were immediately seated at a table behind the hostess stand, against the wall. This was actually a perfect spot to be in because it allowed us to take in how Butterfield's is run like a well-oiled (buttered?) machine: the servers move with precision through the crowded dining rooms, the runners know where they need to be and when, and the entire operation moves like clockwork.  Our waitress, Erika, was awesome. Due to us being in Phoenix for less than 24 hours at the time we dined here, there was a very real chance we were not entirely awake and I may have actually been sleepwalking. Nonetheless, she rolled with our dozens of questions and was an absolute picture of efficiency as she kept our drinks refilled and guided us in the right direction when it came to choosing a meal.  Butterfield's is, I gather, known for their pancakes, which makes this next sentence practically heartbreaking: none of us ordered them. My folks had actually been here the year prior and enjoyed the pancakes then, so at least two of the three of us can confirm they are, indeed, delicious. But this time around, they opted for the blueberry crepes and a make-your-own omelette. The results were fantastic, with the food being delivered promptly and devoured almost as quickly. Coupled with an always-full cup of coffee and tasty juice, and you have two meals that come highly recommended.  As for me, I went with the Mexican burrito, because I enjoy a challenge. Not that it wasn't good; it was wonderful! No, the challenge came in the form of the sheer size of the thing. Unless you are part-Sasquatch, there is no way you can pick this thing up and fit it into your mouth. It's a knife-and-fork meal, but wow, is it worth the dexterity required to finish it. Come to think of it, I didn't finish it since I focused my attention to the hash browns. I don't know what they do to these potatoes, but these things are no joke. Possibly the best breakfast potatoes I have ever had, which is a qualifier I never thought I would ever write.  Look, Butterfield's is a breakfast place that knows exactly what they are doing: providing exceptional food and service for an affordable price. They have other locations, and their waiting rooms are equally jam-packed, so clearly they are great at what they do. If you believe breakfast is the most important meal of the day, then this should be the most important stop on your next morning out.",

Got some extra butter on those bad boys. I should be 5000lbs the way I eat. I also had the fresh squeezed OJ that they just throw the oranges in this machine and boom the freshest OJ in the game. Pulpy and seriously the best OJ I have had. The omelette I think has 3 eggs and this thing is massive. The choice of toast or pancakes and I chose pancakes of course.   The service was great. The coffee is always filled to the max and they give u a of pitcher of water so you don't run out. I have never left hungry and if you do we need to have a talk. Never gonna happen.

I have yet to find another breakfast place that compares to Butterfields. I've always had great food and service, plus I love the fresh orange juice. The portions are huge. The Good Egg which everyone seems to love just can't compare, nor can the chains. Butterfield's gets my vote for best breakfast. Just go early before the crowds get there. It tends to get noisy.",

Anyhow stopped by this place a few weeks ago with a good friend to have some brunch. The Fresh OJ was lovely, my friend went on some random eating binge which scared me. From omelet to toast to pancakes- Carb Deprivation possibly? I guess she really enjoyed her breakfast. I had some Florentine hash brown with grilled chicken and poached eggs (PERFECT POACHED EGGS) was quite lovely. I did have a debate between Belgian waffles- and Benedict sandwiches. Its nice if your starving in the morning and want to have a hot meal waiting for you while you chat along with your friends/family/random stranger.   I've been in the mood for a Belgian waffle but I keep forgetting to go back, odd. Now I find it hard to ever go back to my college buddy IHOP, this place is more than a few steps ahead !",

I am an eggs benedict freak and I can't review without saying.. if you love eggs benedict, these are just so-so. Fruit bowl is nice and huge and can be split between four easily, the waffles look amazing, but the veggie hash really isthe star of the show here for me. Rich (veggies, yes!), filling comfort food with two eggs on top.. over easy... oh my god yum.  Bacon waffle? How did I miss that? That, I have to have ;)",

There was a wait when we got there but it was pretty quick because we were only a party of two. I ordered the eggs benedict (shocker I know) and my friend ordered their whole wheat pancakes. Everything is delicious and really affordable and the portions are large. We were stuffed and only spent like $15 a piece. My friend swears by their fresh squeezed OJ. They also have a small lunch menu if you aren't in the mood for breakfast. The only problem with this place is how far it is from where I live. I'd definitely make the drive for a darn good breakfast though.",

When we walked up we saw lots of families and small groups waiting around for a table, which always worries me because I hate waiting.  Much to my delight the wait was only 15 minutes.  Our server was great, he was attentive and funny and made the experience quite enjoyable.    I ordered their challah French toast (I cannot bring myself to call it \"holly bread\"...I'm sorry, I can't.  It just ain't right.) which was good but was missing a particular flavor that I couldn't put my finger on.  However being 2500 miles from the nearest NY diner I will take what I can get!  The home fries were very good, the perfect crunchiness and not too greasy.  It seemed as if most of the dishes came with a ton of options, for example my husband's (huge) \"scrambler\" also came with a side of pancakes.  My parents, my husband and I ate enough food to keep us full for the entire day!  The menu is pretty extensive and I'm interested in trying some of the other options, so I will definitely be returning.",

But I have been forced to go out to eat at an ungodly early hour at Butterfields and they are a breath of fresh classy air for breakfast restaurants in the area.   So as I mentioned I am not a morning/ breakfast person. Once when I was dragged here with the early rising hungry freakish friends I ordered a granola yogurt and fruit sundae and lots of coffee. The sundae was huge fresh and my friends who were initially disappointed with my choice were way jealous!   Now my friends obviously tend to order more filling and typical breakfast dishes and they LOVE this place. I can see why! Their food always looks freshly prepared and delicious. Another impressive thing about Butterfields is the prices. As I mentioned the food is good quality, the portions are huge, and the prices are about the same as  IHOP'S and Denny's.",

I have trouble ordering as there are many things that look appetizing, but even when sticking with the basics, i.e. scrambled eggs, hashbrowns and pancakes, I leave smiling and full. The service has always been good and the food has always appeared quickly after ordering.  If you find yourself looking for \"a breakfast place\" this should be your destination.",

The staff is very attentive, the place is clean, and you can see that this place takes pride in everything. They have their own bottled syrup and their moto is \"Where breakfast is an all day affair.\" As it should be of course.   They have a great menu of stuff. Some great pancakes, baked dutch and apple pancakes and some really creative french toasts. And that is just the beginning. There are egg dishes to no end. We ordered the baby apple pancake (baked, it takes 30 minutes) and an omelet (that comes with pancakes and hash browns). Everything was GREAT. If you have never had a baked dutch apple pancake, you should check it out!!!!! There are probably 3-4 apples in this thing and pretty much guaranteed that you will not eat it in one sitting, unless you share it. I had it for two days in a row (the same one, half each day). MMMMMMM!!! It was just great. The omelet was very good as well. My boyfriend ordered the bacon, avocado and cheese omelet. Everything was just perfect.   The funny thing is, the service is almost too good. They filled the coffees so much, it was never cold and we kept having to add sugars and creamers. Our waitress took exceptional care of us, and I noticed that other tables were also well taken care of around us. I highly recommend this place!!!!",

Its funny though because i was standing right by the hostess stand and they kept telling everyone who came in the wait was 15 minutes. They told us that thats why we stayed to wait. It worked though we waited. If she had told us 30 mintues we probably would have left because we were hungry.

The fresh squeezed orange juice is out of this world.  What's the problem?  The service has slid off a cliff over the past year.  I can live with the wacky filipino waiters who are way too friendly but lately there is a collection of young girls that can't seem to get an order correct and can't seem to get anything done in a timely manner.  Last week I sat there for 15 minutes before anyone asked me if I'd like coffee.  This with an active and hungry 2 year old.

They were topped with fresh raspberries, a raspberry sauce and a marscarpone cream sauce.  It was just the right blend of raspberries with cream. We also tried the New Orleans French Toast topped with sauteed bananas.  Both dishes were great.    Very happy with our first experience at Butterfields!",

    "text": "My grandfather's favorite meal is breakfast, so I think I've been to every breakfast joint in Scottsdale.  Butterfield's is better than most, but not the best I've ever had. I do, however, wish I could give them five stars for service alone.   Look at the menu and you'll see its very similar to The Original Pancake House, but I found the food wasn't as good.  I live in Dallas and at our Original you can taste the fresh cream, butter, high quality vegetables, and rich cheeses in every bite of your meal.  I didn't find this at Butterfield's.  It  reminds me of a cross between IHOP and The Original.  Our party ordered Blueberry Pancakes, Feta and Tomoato Scramblers and Banana Nut French Toast.  Again the best way to describe it all was good but not great.  The service however was excellent!!  When you walk in you can definitely tell that Butterfield's is a chain restaurant and that the staff is very \"on message.\"  However their demeanor doesn't come across as fake or annoying, but rather friendly and pleasant.  Often at breakfast joints you get distracted and hurried service.  Not the case here, the service was personal and efficient.  They didn't do anything in particular to \"wow\" me, I just got the impression that the restaurant operates that way every day.",

They have fruit crepes, 6 kinds of french toast including bannana nut bread french toast (YUM), egg scrambles, belgin waffels, and more. I had the biscuts and gravy which was good. The breakfast sausage you can get patties or links. Of course I got links and my god they were like 3 inches long and a 1 inch thick. They have thick cut bacon that was actually crispy not soggy and limp. The eggs benidict was freggin awesome! I will be back for this for sho. This place does breakfast realy good, but they are open till 3pm and they do lunch as well. I went there at 11am on a wed and there was a 15 min wait. I was suprised there was a wait that late in the morning but now I know why. This place rocks! Service was great. Everyone workin there was friendly and in good spirits. I cant wait to go back.",

We apparently were waiting for two tables to be put together because we were 8 people and this ended up taking an hour. Had I known that it would take so long, we would have left. Once we were seated, we got our coffee quickly and ordered fast since the kids were starving. Food was great, lots of choices and some options I hadn't seen on a menu in years ie: Dutch Babies. Not sure i will come again because the management and hostesses did not manage the flow of customers, their tables or their seating well.",

One of the hardest thing about waffles is keeping them from getting hard by the time you're done with your eggs and bacon. Butterfield 's has come up with some kind of magic batter. Their bacon is thick cut, which scores big with me.    Getting in to Butterfield 's will take 20-30 minutes, but that is because the place is so popular. To avoid the wait, get there early.    Service at Butterfield 's is always amazing. I've never had any problems. My hard to please brother-in-law was even impressed.  The service was as consistent as the first time I went there almost three years ago. That means they consistently strive to be the best.    Sadly, my wife lives on the west side, and I live in Sierra Vista. But, the trek is well worth it every so often. I'd probably be even more overweight if I lived closer.",

    "text": "Update: I stopped by on 6/8/16, bad experience all the way around. At least the coffee was excellent. Ordered the apple pancake at 1:40PM, only a few customers in the restaurant. I waited almost an hour and the manager says, I assume they told you what happened. NO, if they had told me they gave my order to someone 5 minutes after they walked in I would have ordered something that does not take 20 to 30 minutes. Then to make things worse, they gave me an undercooked pancake. The manger gives me $6.50 off my bill without me asking which was a small gesture, but I guess I look like I make minimum wage. If it had been properly cooked then at least they made some effort. Bottom line; this was a great restaurant, but not anymore. I hope the owner reads the reviews and takes some action as I used to love this place.  in 2014, I was so impressed: I recently move to PHX and love breakfast. Unfortunately almost every breakfast restaurant has been a big disappointment so far. I have been to Butterfields 3 times and ordered something different each time. Excellent food, service with a great atmosphere too.  I wanted to try the apple pancake on the 2nd visit, but I did not have the time (30 mins) to wait. On my 3rd visit, I called them and asked if I could order it for 7:30 AM and I would be there at 7:15 or 7:20. They said no problem and made it clear they wanted me to be a happy customer, I was impressed. This baked huge pancake has enough calories for 2 days, but it was excellent ....... two tables next to me had never seen it before. One table said they were going to \"share\" one on their next visit based on just the great smell.",

It originally came with cheese, but they left it off for me. This comes with your choice of pancakes or grits. I picked whole wheat pancakes. Sooooo good. Everything was delicious.

I had a two egg breakfast with bacon (yay they have my turkey bacon here). With my egg breakfast, two pancakes and a bowl of fruit too. That's a lot of food! It was all sooo good. The eggs were fluffy and perfectly cooked, bacon was nice and crispy but not burnt, super fresh fruit (melons, berries, and grapes), and of course their pancakes were delightful. I love me some good pancakes and Butterfield's pancakes are definitely top notch. They are on the smaller side but so sweet and fluffy. Add some butter and syrup, and MWAH! Perfection. I also tried a bite of my Dad's Denver omelette and it too was great.  We visited during the late morning on a weekday and it was packed. The short wait was definitely worth it. Service was friendly and attentive. Our food was made and delivered pretty fast. Prices were very fair. My meal was around $9 and the total for our table of three was less than $30.   I wish we had Butterfield's in California. I would be visiting every week if it was! Definitely worth a visit if you're in Scottsdale.",

We both ordered the Whole Hog skillet and my little guy ordered the Mickey Mouse pancake and sausage.  The pancakes were very light and fluffy served with a sprinkling of powdered sugar like when we were kids. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and cooked all the way through without being over cooked.  Carafe of water on the table which is awesome. Perfect medium sized portions. Polite waitstaff.  Drove 45 minutes to get here and will definitely be back.",

The place was slammed and he was busy as a bee, but still kept his section running smoothly.  Every time he approached our table it was like the whole buzzing restaurant was the tornado and Willy was the calm in the eye of the storm; we were the only people who mattered and he was so serene and happy. It felt like we were at a fine dining experience on a luxurious cruise ship every time he approached our table.  ...and the FOOD. Holy Moly! SO GOOD!! It's basic breakfast items, but they are cooked to perfection and with such quality ingredients that it is like a 'foodie' experience in your grandma's kitchen. Love from good food!  Their menu has gluten free notations also!  Their gluten free pancakes are the best I've ever had!  The bacon was thick cut and delicious. The coffee was even very delicious and kept coming and coming.  Our cups were never empty of anything!  Did I mention they have great service??  I currently live in San Diego which is a super 'foodie town' - but they ain't got nothing on Butterfields in Scottsdale.  Butterfields, will you please open a location in San Diego so I don't have to wait for my next AZ visit?",

The Cajun chicken sausage is well seasoned and cooked just right. Their pancakes are fluffy yet filling. Whoever makes the eggs, bravo! Over easy eggs are perfect. The scrambles and omelettes aren't over cooked. There is always a perfect filling to egg ration, you are able to enjoy every ingredient.  The staff is always so kind and the waitresses I have had so far are both complete gems. Everyone I have shared this restaurant with have become fans. I haven't had a bad meal or experience here. I honestly don't think I ever will...",

I have had most of the scrambles and omelets, and all are terrific. The gluten-free pancakes are not the best but they're passable. The texture is off but the flavor is decent.  The wait can be long during traditional breakfast/brunch times on the weekend but if you get there before 9 am or after 12 pm the wait is short or nonexistent.",

I'm a dude and understand it all, but come on man! This experience has ruined my experience at Butterfields.

Portion sizes are big, services is good and fast and their quality of food is home cooked food. The only negative thing is this place is Very Popular and they are only open from like 6am to 3p and no matter what day or what time it is this place is buzzing and busy. Wait times can be a little long (max we've wait for up to 5 people is 15-20mins) and they don't take reservations or put your name on the list with out your whole party being present. BUT that is fine with me because that keeps the tables turning and people happy! I highly recommend you go here if your craving an amazing breakfast!!! Great food, reasonable prices and good service deserves to be recognized these days. Seems like more and more customer serves and restaurant quality is on a huge decline and it's very refreshing to find a great place.",

A friend of ours invited us to breakfast on a Saturday morning for her birthday so we decided to check it out.  We like to try new places, preferably closer to home, so why not. Our table ordered a variety of food with several picky eaters and everyone agreed it was one of the beast breakfast spots we have ever tried.  The omelets where so soft and fluffy I would swear they cooked them in a steam bath.  The hash browns are more like home fries and are normally very crispy.  The french toast was soft and the pancakes were fluffy.  I would actually make the drive to eat here again.  Unfortunately, the rest of the city knows about this place as well so getting their early is key.",

Didn't need to ask for anything and always had plenty of coffee and re-fills! Speaking of coffee, I ordered the house coffe and it was delicious! I dunno if it was the coffee or the creamer but it was smooth and a little bold (just how I like it). I ordered the chorizo & avocado omelette and was NOT disappointed. It had a lot of cheese, but other than that it was amazing. My lil bro ordered the pancakes and those were so so fluffy and wonderful! I would definitely go back!!!!",

My Eggs Benedict were overcooked (after having a discussion with our waitress specifically about wanting the yolks still a bit runny and being assured they were... they weren't) and my friend's Apple French Toast was good-- not too sweet-- but not phenomenal.    Like the stars say, it was \"A-ok,\" just not necessarily more than that.  Worth a visit if you're so inclined.  Maybe you'll have better luck.  I'm not sure why a place so average had a line out the door... maybe I'm missing something?",

The answer I got was because they make the hash browns all in one batch. Maybe I'm being a little extra but why can't you take a small portion of that batch out and then let it cool for just a little bit longer? But hey, I'm not a chef and a restaurant so I don't know how the cooking process is at any restaurant.",

While the food is beyond delicious and always delivered hot and fresh to your table (we go every weekend for a nice, leisurely breakfast), I write this review to acknowledge ESTHER - the amazing hostess and air traffic controller who essentially runs the front of the house. Esther is never flustered, despite the incredible pace at which this restaurant serves its frequently packed location. She is flashing hand signals to bus staff, flips her iPad around on her wrist to see which table is open next, and is in complete control of the dining room with that ever-present smile on her face. Walking into what seems like absolute chaos on the weekends for breakfast, Esther marks a very reassuring presence that you will be seated efficiently, greeted, and sent out the door with a warm goodbye.

While we were waiting I noticed the art on the ceiling and it was great for the atmosphere we were in. Then as promised we were seated and drinks were quickly ordered for us. Our server was nothing short of spectacular. She was very pretty and she was very attentive. She checked on us regularly and was funny and even made great recommendations. Then the food came and I was impressed with the amount that was given. Plus it tasted great! I recommend this place whole heartedly. The service, the atmosphere, the food, and the art are all great here! Please go in and enjoy!",

They have flavor instead of just being bland potato tasting. They're also perfectly cooked, crunchy in the outside and soft on the inside. You have lots of choices on the menu which is great but I always get the Popeye scramble. My only complaint is that you have to choose between hash browns and grits, you can't get both without an added cost. But, the extra cost is worth it because they're both SOOO good!",

I don't know if it was because it was the holiday, but it just made our dining experience =/   I came on Monday (observation of New Years) and there was a 45 minute wait for our party of 6. There was quite the crowd outside of the restaurant, but the wait wasn't as long as I expected. The wait was well worth the food!  I can make a pretty damn good banana nut bread so I was quite skeptical of ordering the Banana bread french toast, but decided to get it looking at all the reviews about it. OMG it was by far the star of all the dishes we tried at our table. The banana bread was so moist and tasty. It comes with fresh slices of banana and pecans. It wasn't very sweet and it didn't need any syrups because the natural flavors were outstanding. SO GOOOD!   Wildberry Crepes were also delicious. There was a perfect balance of tastes and textures from the mascarpone creme, berries and the crepe itself. Also, very light. It was very yumm.  If you are looking for savory breakfast, the New Mexico Skillet was great. Nice blend of chorizo sausage, onion, green peppers and avocado and hash browns and cheese w/ choice of eggs on top. The hash browns are fresh, crispy and very tastyyy.",

This time, I had the Florentine Benedict with hollandaise sauce and potatoes - yummy! Coffee is great. Normally, our service is good but it was very sub par yesterday. I will give 4 stars today based on past experiences.  There are typically 3 people at the host desk- even when it isn't needed. Maybe they could help out with refilling coffee when they aren't so busy. There also did not seem to be a manager on duty and that would be helpful. It's a good place, good food etc but I would never go again on a Sunday.",

I have a chorizo skillet  that I am still dreaming about!  It was finely chopped chorizo full of flavor and topped with a fried egg over easy to perfection!  Coffee was very good and the sever kept coming with refills and to check on us if we needed anything. Would definitely return but hesitant to endure a long wait on the weekends.",

    "text": "Finally was able to dine here after YEARS of bookmarking this place.  I first heard of Butterfield's while living in IL-- do you know that Butterfield's may only be found in TWO U.S. states?  One location in Scottsdale, AZ, and four locations in IL!  Butterfield's \"recently\" had another baby addition to the family called Butters, which may be found on Northsight and Raintree off of the 101.  (The first Butters is on E. Via de Ventura.  Pretty much the same menu as Butterfield's EXCEPT you won't find the Baby Apple, the Dutch Baby, the Crispy Chicken Fingers platter, nor the Crispy Chicken Salad at Butters.)  I came in here once many years ago and determined that I could not do ANY of the specialty pancakes due to the presence of powdered sugar and/or corn syrup in the toppings/glazes/sauces.  However, after making a phone call to Butterfield's yesterday, I found out that the Baby Apple is FREE of corn syrup and powdered sugar!  The apple filling consists of apples, sugar, butter, and cinnamon- that's it!  One very important thing to note is that both Baby Apple and Dutch Baby require 30 minutes to cook, and I've already asked... you may call in your order so as to cut down your waiting time when you arrive at the restaurant.  I didn't call my order in ahead, though.  For a 10 am seating on a Wednesday morning, Butterfield's was busy, but Mom and I did not have to wait at all for a booth, and coffee and water service was delivered just a few minutes after we sat down- sweet!  Another thing to note about Butterfield's is you will NOT need to flag someone down for fresh coffee!  A rough count of how many times I had coffee topped off is four, and multiple servers must've stopped at our table AT LEAST ten times.  I don't mind the interruptions, though.  I'd rather have them ask/stop by too much than too little, or not at all.  I originally wanted to just wait for my Baby Apple to arrive, but since Mom's Taffy Apple French toast wasn't going to take 30 minutes, I decided to put in an order for Two Eggs ($7), which also comes with crispy hash browns and choice of pancakes or toast.  Mom wanted bacon (so did I), and a side of bacon with the eggs costs $2.50. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/butterfields-pancake-house-scottsdale?select=tXZNOcBEb97ptGeOQW-PGA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/butt...</a>  Lovely entree--we both enjoyed the hash browns' crispiness (they're smashed rather than shredded), and the three strips of bacon were delightful, as well.  Oh, and the pancakes are a must!  I'm impressed. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/butterfields-pancake-house-scottsdale?select=JFblrAuCUEY6qYjvJardgw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/butt...</a>  I had to pay an extra $2 for pure maple syrup here.  I didn't mind paying the extra charge, but I DID mind that the syrup came in a foil-capped plastic container.  I'd rather have a refillable bottle like those I've encountered elsewhere at similar prices.  Mom would not order the Taffy Apple again. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/butterfields-pancake-house-scottsdale?select=f2SEY0zO4grlpZCYTxZX7Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/butt...</a>  I was surprised that the caramel and apples weren't sweet enough for her; she had to add Butterfield's own blend of maple and corn syrups.  I couldn't try her French toast, since I did not specify \"no powdered sugar.\"  She said she'd wished she'd just ordered the plain brioche...    Would like to return again to try other egg dishes, and to enjoy the bright interior, upbeat service, and constant coffee refills!  (Oh, and you may take a cup of coffee to-go, if you need any more-- I did not!)  Oh, and what about that Baby Apple? <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/butterfields-pancake-house-scottsdale?select=Wa1lq5MVpDGmKHgRShRHVA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/butt...</a>  It was SO sweet!  I'll have to try it again as a snack either later today, or tomorrow and update my review.  ---  The Baby Apple is best eaten at the restaurant.  Refrigeration altered the texture of the flaky pancake to something I'm not too keen about (but the flaky, fluffy layers were lovely fresh-from-the-oven!  Also, I wish there were more apple pieces.  I did have a couple of thin slices that Wednesday morning, and after consuming 1/4 of the pancake yesterday, and a quarter today, I finally stumbled onto half of a slice today!  Curious as to what tomorrow's quarter will bring...  ;)",

    "text": "Absolutely worst experience I have ever encountered. I am a little late posting this review but did not want this to go unsaid. My husband and I came in for breakfast and we were treated horribly from the minute we walked through the door. First the hostess did not even notice us until we went asked if we could be seated, did not smile once and gave the impression she hated her job. She brought us to a booth towards the end, away from everything and we sat there for fifteen minutes with no service. Finally after going back up front to ask for a server we finally had someone come to our table. Our server was the definition of EVERYTHING a server should not do! She was rude from the beginning to the end. I had asked for some orange juice and she brought the wrong drink three times. My husband wanted just the regular buttermilk pancakes with bacon he got sausage and blueberries in his pancakes and we had explained he had an allergy to blueberrys meaning would have to wait even longer for a SIMPlE STACK OF PANCAKES.! After I had asked what she would recommend for dessert, she had the liberty to say \"I don't know\". I explained we would pass on dessert and if I could speak to a manager. She said he was busy but she would have him come over. The manager right off the back came across as \"the manager is always right \" he made it very clear that he felt his restaurant was the best in the country and explained his servers are only the best and there's no way they could of done anything of the things I explained. I played the bill and left. Couldn't believe the rudeness and disrespect I had to see. I thought it would be a nice breakfast out but instead it was the absolute worst moments of my life and can ensure everyone I will never be back !",

She recommended the corn beef skillet which didn't disappoint. I also ordered a side biscuit with white gravy which was phenomenal.

So, I'm finally writing the review, based off of my experience the last time I went. The place has been remodeled since the last time I came in, they seem too be trying to keep up with the other \"hipster-scottsdale-class\" breakfast places around Scottsdale. One of the problem I usually have with this place is, the fact it takes so long to get it in that usually the people that I'm with don't want to go there. Thankfully, that was not an issue this time, albeit it was a Tuesday morning. The food was excellent & a much better value than some of the other places around Scottsdale like, Hash Kitchen. I got the Mexican Omlet with a side of Hash browns & cinnamon roll pancakes. Everything was excellent & only cost $13 for everything, which is less than you would pay for a few pancakes al a carte at the Hash Kitchen. I will definitely be coming back here in the future. The only downside to this place is the wait, which can be extremely long on weekends. Other than that, Butterfield's is one of the best Breakfast places I've been to in Scottsdale.",

Too much to eat all of it and worth the 20 minute wait on a busy Sunday morning. The pancakes were melt in your mouth goodness. I was super happy with the omelet but the pancakes were a delight. Others in my party ordered the protein pancakes, the eggs verde, and a skillet breakfast. No complaints about anything we were served and I'm sure by the crowd waiting for seats it was clear that we'd picked an excellent spot to eat. You will not be disappointed eating here!",

    "text": "We were here when they first opened up and decided to try it again to see if anything changed.  We were seated right away on hard chairs on a table for 4.  All the clutter in the middle with all the condiments is very disgusting and should be re-worked.  We put everything to the corner to get it out of our way.  Someone came right over to take our drink order and then they brought out the wrong tea, we ordered green tea, they brought us earl grey.  We ordered hot water with lemon and they forgot the lemon, we ordered Orange Juice and they forgot to bring it until we asked them more than 4x...Finally after the drink orders were straighten out and they brought us the correct stuff, our orders came out.  Avoid the hash browns, they have no flavor what so ever and the only thing in their HB are potatoes no salt or pepper, we sent them back and they bought out a very tiny bowl of fruit for us which had less than 10 small pieces of fruit.  Not real sure why they put powdered sugar on the pancakes, but they do and we did not know this so had to send our pancakes back, powdered sugar on cakes does not taste good, it is not a dessert but a breakfast item.  The gluten-free pancakes were dry, sweet and hard to eat without lots of fluid.  The make your own egg omelet with baby spinach an cheese was ok - light and airy.  Not real sure what all the fuss is about, but we were not impressed, the food is not a wow factor - everything is just either okay or not okay...nothing will wow your taste buds and there are other places in town which do this.  I wish someone someplace would make a great tasting gluten free pancake which is not dry.  We probably will not be back, not a favorite place of ours, we have had too many problems with their food or lack of good tasting food.",

While I really wanted to try the French toast or waffles, I also didn't want all the sugar and carbs ...so I opted for the veggie omlet, which came with harsh browns and a side of pancakes. I upgraded to blueberry pancakes. I felt the portions were huge, but appropriate for the price. Mine was excellent! Dave had the apple cinnamon baked pancake...which I had to try...and it was really good. Also, our service was excellent...I was in desperate need of coffee and she kept my cup filled. I will definitely be back to try some other specialty items.",

    "text": "I've visited Butterfield's on several occasions, and while I am never let down by the food or the service, I always feel a bit rushed.  Yes, I understand that there are people waiting for tables, and the quicker you can get me out of there and the next table in, the more money you will make, but what happened today was a real disappointment.    My daughter and I stopped in for breakfast at 9:15 this morning.  The restaurant was only about 3/4 full so we were seated immediately.  We placed our drink order moments after we were seated, and as soon as our server returned with our drinks we ordered our breakfast.  Our food was served within five minutes.  Everything was prepared exactly as we had requested.    We were still enjoying our meal when the bus person stopped by to clear some dishes.  He attempted to take my (two year old) daughter's plate because she was not actively eating it.  I stopped him and said she was still working on it.  He also asked if he could clear my side order of pancakes.  There was still half of the order of on my plate and we had only been eating for about seven minutes.  I told him I was not finished, and he left our table empty handed.    About seven more minutes passed before he returned.  My daughter had eaten every last drop of her kid's chocolate chip pancakes and strip of bacon so he cleared her plate.  He again tried to clear my pancakes plate, despite the fact that I was holding my fork in my hand.  I told him, once more, that we were still working on them.    Our server came by and offered me another iced tea.  I accepted and asked that she bring the check and a small box for my leftovers.  She returned with the tea, check and take out box moments later.  I told her I needed to take my daughter to the restroom, but that we would be coming back right back to finish up as I handed her my debit card to pay.  When we returned to the table it had been completely cleared.  My daughter's orange juice ($3.29 for a kid's size) which was nearly full was gone, as was the untouched iced tea my server had just brought and my side of pancakes.  The take out box with the remainder of my corned beef hash and eggs was sitting on the edge if the table with my check waiting to be signed.  The table had already been set for the next guests.  Unbelievable...We had only been in the restaurant for 31 minutes (from the time we entered the door until we came back to our cleared table)!  If you removed the obnoxious, overzealous busser from this equation our meal would have been four stars.  It was delicious.  Our server was friendly enough.  She made sure our needs were met and checked on us often.    I will likely return to give Butterfield's another chance, but if I am EVER rushed like I was today, you can rest assured I will not return.  I hope to be able to update this review with a couple extra stars soon!",

We were told to let the \"host staff\" know when the others arrived and we would be seated.  Our party was complete less than 5 minutes later. We were then put on the bottom of the wait list. Tick... tick... tick.  Empty booths near the first half of our party were filled.  Tick... tick... tick. We made several inquiries to the host staff.  Tick... tick... tick. Our first four had coffee and juice at the table and we remained standing. Tick... tick... tick. At 11:20 we walked out of Butterfield's in favor of Eggstacy - just down the street - where we were welcomed warmly, seated immediately, and had a lovely lunch. Butterfield's is off our list!",

We were pleasantly surprised to see an updated restaurant - they modernized it quite a bit and took down some dividers so it really brightens up the place. Not sure when they did this remodel as we haven't been back since we moved out of AZ three years ago...but it looks great. It's as busy as ever but we were smart and arrived at about 8:15am. We only had to wait about 10 minutes. If you arrive after 9am, be prepared to wait. We walked out about 9:30am and the crowd outside was growing by the minute. However, they have a large waiting area inside and out so that helps. Their food is just as good as we remember...we HAD to get a bacon waffle or it wouldn't have been the same. They are still on point with their coffee game - pouring us our first cups almost immediately after sitting down and never letting it get past half empty. My little one loved his pancakes and happily sat in his high chair nom nom noming away at them. Delicious! Thanks for still being around Butterfields...we look forward to more brunches whenever we visit AZ!",

    "text": "I want to share with you an incident that occurred  on April 15 at the Scottsdale Butterfield's.  I have enjoyed this restaurant with excellent customer service especially during busy times.  That's why I continue to eat there.  However after today's incident, I have second thoughts.  Today I came with my Aunt and friend at noon.  We were seated right away.   I understand the kitchen gets backed during this period but receiving our food at 1:30  is totally unacceptable.  I have never waiting this long for the food to be served.  I ordered a turkey burger which came out half cooked.  I spoke to our server that it needed to be sent back and rather than having the kitchen properly cook the burger she sent the manager over. Chris is the manager and told me that they cook all their burgers medium. In fact, he was quite rude.  I assume your managers receive proper training in etiquette but one \"must have slipped through the cracks.\"  I believe he has a problem understanding the difference between a hamburger and turkey burger.  A turkey burger needs to be cooked all the way through and he was arguing with me that that it was. It wasn't!  After waiting another half hour to get my new turkey burger, I did get one that was cooked through.  The server understood I was quite irritated over the entire incident and yet she failed to comp the burger as a way of saying they were sorry.  To my surprise, the bill came and was charge for the burger.  Again the manager came over and expressed under no circumstances would they take the charge off.  REALLY????  Never mind that we had to wait over an hour to get the food that was not properly cooked.  After expressing my displeasure with Chris that I would not be coming back, his response was  \"that was my choice.\"  Is that how your managers treat customers?  There was no need for his behavior.  I'm paying for an enjoyable meal with good service. What happened to trying to please your customers? No I was not looking for a free lunch, but  the inconvenience and the arrogance of the management should not be tolerated  by anyone.  I contacted Corporate Headquarters and it will be interesting to see if I get any response.",

Asked the server for the rest of the order and more strawberry's.  She brought the sauce and sour cream but if I wanted more strawberry's, there there would be a $1.99 up charge.  I declined her generous offer.  After talking to the Manager he claimed that 3 is the normal amount, one strawberry per crepe and it was obvious that he couldn't care less.   Even Denny's gives you enough strawberry's to make a nice appearance.  Manager is worthless and could have corrected the problem but chose not to.",

Our server, Angela, was awesome and personable, and we loved her.

    "text": "We discovered this place about a year ago or so. Very nice atmosphere with plenty of seating, but always packed ...even during the week. The first 3 times it was unbelievably good in every way 5 stars, except the typical hour plus wait(even during the week)sucked, but at that point- totally worth it. The app for seating makes it easier to know when it's time to be seated.   The service was great, we had the same waitress who had reddish hair and she was lively and humorous. The coffee at that point, was the best coffee in any restaurant or coffee shop, I had ever had!  It was rich, strong, and very flavorful and they kept it coming. There were add'l servers who kept the coffee going for everyone. Being caffeine sensitive, I was about to jump out of my skin and still asked for a refill to go. It was soooo good. I asked one of the owners to put in a drive thru, just for the coffee.  If you are a coffee snob, you get it right?  The food was excellent! I got the blueberry pancakes with a side of bacon and added OJ the 3 rd visit. After I heard the OJ was fresh squeezed, well you just have to get it, perfect OJ!  The pancakes were hot, fresh, fluffy, large portion and yummy. Blueberries were also delish and packed in the cakes. The bacon was a smoky applewood, thick and chewy.   My husband got the New Mexico Skillet (has Chorizo), it was also very good and I don't usually prefer that type of breakfast but I might have even ordered it as some point.  My husband got that skillet almost every time, the portion was a tad on the small side, especially considering portions on other items.  It has the option to come with plain pancakes, which were very tasty but could use added real vanilla extract.  The 3rd time I ordered a California Scrambler no cheese, and it was massive! I ate about a third.  The omelet tasted like it was coated in real butter, way too much butter for me. I thought the scrambler was going to be a healthier choice, but I don't think it could have been.  Good to know.  The last two times we went were late last summer, and were huge disappointments! The blueberry pancakes tasted cheaper like from a cheap mix and more chewy. The blueberries were noticeably less.  The bacon was overdone crispy. The coffee, it broke our hearts, was watered down and tasted very different. I didn't ask for even one refill.  We asked a server what happened and they seemed to avoid the question. It was a very ...very, sad day. The service was no longer on point, we had different servers though. We thought it must be a weird fluke. We gave it one more try. My husband got the plain pancakes, they were bland and tasted like cheap mix again. I tried the french toast, it was cool, super eggy and chewy.  Coffee was still watered down and different. Service was not as good either. We thought we had found the perfect breakfast place, and it slipped away. Ugh please bring the amazing coffee back and the food and service. We would go back if they reverted to their former amazing selves.  We might give it a shot again since recent reviews seem better.    FYI Butters is the same menu & same owners. But that restaurant's stuff slipped at that point too. Although way less of a wait and smaller restaurant. So heart breaking. Maybe the restaurants were going through a trying to cut costs phase.",

I would highly recommend checking this place out. The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because the hostesses were NOT friendly at all.

I can appreciate that it's a super busy restaurant but service is still a huge part of dining out. Our issue was that we could not get coffee when we were first seated nor could we get anyone including the manager to get our ticket and pick up the credit card off the table for almost 15 minutes.  I will give it to them that the food was served hot.  I suppose that's enough for some.",

Server was VERY prompt showing up about a minute after I was seated. She was very pleasant and gave me plenty of time to look over the menu. I ordered the Santa Fe scramble with hashbrowns and pancakes. My order arrived in under 5 min and they were slammed! Food was hot and delicious as usual.   Watching the staff work was like watching a professional sports team. Bussers were clearing tables seconds after guests left and guests were being seated as the busser made his last swipe with the cleaning cloth. These people do it right and if anyone says you can't expect this at less than a 5 star place, they're dead wrong. Point them to Butterfield's.",

We were in the need of something other than liquid sustenance and after questioning Siri about the nearest pancake or waffle joint, we found ourselves holding a buzzer outside, shielding the sun from our eyes. There was a line of early birds (also snowbirds) before us, but we waited no more than 10 minutes for a table. Food filled up our entire table and it was all fantastic. Namesake pancakes, a breakfast burrito, mexicana omelette, cajun chicken sausage, eggs, bacon, fresh squeezed orange juice and the best hash browns ever. They're not the shredded kind of hash brown or the home fries type. My best guess is parboiled, sliced and then placed on the flat top to get nice and crisp. They're the best hash browns around by far! I'm not normally a pancake person but I definitely was into those pancakes. This place definitely provided the sustenance we were looking for. Enough that we went out and did it all over again.",

I've had the omelettes -decent, but I've had way better elsewhere or even at home! Breakfast burrito stinks - so disappointed! I make a breakfast burrito at home that tastes wayyyy better! So when I go out to eat, especially something simple like breakfast it better be good! I'm a savory breakfast water so I can't speak for their sweets but maybe that's what this place is known for- my husband loves their pancakes and French toast.",

We had to wait 15 or 20 minute, but it was noon and we had a party of eight, so I'm not holding that against them. I saw 20 different kinds of omelets, skillets, burgers, and other things, but I knew what I was getting before we sat down. Most of my party were kosher, but they had no problem omitting this and adding that, etc. The food on the menu looked healthy; lots of vegetable omelets, the they had turkey bacon, stuff like that. It took me a little while to find what I wanted: A ham and cheese omelet, hash browns, toast and two order of thick bacon. It was by far the least healthy combination that they had. I laughed when they gave me the choice of fruit or hash browns. Every item on my plate was excellent, but the omelet set itself apart from the pack. It was the lightest, fluffiest, tastiest omelet that I've had in a long while. I usually finish-up what other people leave over, but everyone cleaned their plate :( I still can't believe how good those eggs were.",
