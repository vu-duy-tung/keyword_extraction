    "text": "Okay, I'm a firm believer in three strikes you're out.  I gave it two tries, but I couldn't even stomach a third time at this place.    God!!!!  I sooooooo wanted to love this little quirky place that reminded me of the beach stands in the few remaining un-yuppified beach towns in California. Well, the atmosphere is there, right down to the funny guys that work the place.    Food is pretty much like music for me, I like all music and I like all food.  I can pretty much find something good in every meal....but not so today.  I take that back...the salsa verde was some of the best I have had.  First try there....wet soggy flavorless fish tacos.  This weekend, I sent my hubby down for a couple of burritos (recommended by yelp reviewers actually), I knew it was a gamble, and I wanted to be able to give a good review, so I picked something everyone said was consistently good.  The green beef burrito.  Hubby had a hot dog of some sort.  Little had a bean, cheese and rice burrito.    We were 0 for 0.  My burrito....so cold the cheese didn't melt, so big it couldn't even fold and so wet the tortilla melted.  I don't know if it was so disturbing to eat that I couldn't taste it, or if it just had none.  My husband's hot dog grossed me out just at presentation.  He started to make something else and I said, well at least try it, he did and he had to choke it down.  Little has NEVER turned down a bean and cheese but she took one bite and never looked back.    I want places like this to stick around so bad I'm tempted to print out these reviews and mail them to them.  I'm on a bad review streak.  Gotsta find some good eats soon, maybe Golden Buddah for lunch will turn me around!",

The interior is great too, having an eclectic blend of old posters and record albums. The downside is... there is no inside seating with the A/C. That aside, who cares, John and Nacho were great. Very friendly guys. Nacho had my burrito done within, it seemed like seconds. I sat on the East Side deck and devoured my little donkey, (yes burrito means little donkey). I had the Red Chili burrito with Volcano Salsa. I loved it! The burrito was filled with meat that is marinated to perfection, the beans and rice and other tasty offerings all rolled up and grilled. I love the taste of the grilled tortilla, enabling me to man-handle this one pound mexi-masterpiece. I will be back. They're menu is fairly simple making it easy to decide what to get. Next time... The green chili burrito. I can't wait.",

    "text": "I was out running errands when I got hungry and decided to take a shot on Two Hippies Beach House. I pulled in and almost hit a crack head who walked in front of my car with two Phoenix Police Officers as witnesses to this mishap. After waiting for said crack head to skitter away, I got out of my car and approached the line. One of the officers said to me \"Good brakes!\" Whew!   For my lunch, I decided on a fish burro sans cilantro and a peach lemonade. I was thankful for the cash I had in my wallet as they do not accept plastic of any form.   I only had to wait for about 5 minutes for my food to be done and I was on my way home. I unwrapped my burro and took a huge bite. Hmm... nothing too amazing, just ok. First off. I DISLIKE when restaurants don't warm the tortilla that they make burros with and yes, this Blatina can tell the difference. Second, the burro was FULL of cabbage and not a lot of fish. The salsa was good and flavorful so I used a lot of it to flavor the burro and it brought some good spice to the burro.   Overall it was just ok. Nothing amazing and nothing I would crave. The real winner was the peach lemonade that comes in slushy form. Yum!   I would visit Two Hippies again to try their other offerings. The price is good, and the food is ok.",

I walked up to the lil window and asked about the veggie options, the guy behind the counter informed me that they have a cactus burrito and that it was one of his favorites. Score! Or so I thought...  Upon receiving the large, heavily stuffed burrito, I bit in with high hopes. Those hopes quickly dissipated as I found that the innards of the burrito were primarly COLD. The cactus pieces were cold, the cheese wasn't melted at all. The only thing that had a bit of warmth were the beans, which weren't even hot, they were luke warm.  Sorry guys, but a cold burrito isn't going to cut it. Make that cactus, beans and rice HOT in your burritos if you want some customers. Melt the friggin cheese in there, don't leave it ice cold.",

I tried the chicken tacos and they were huge and I got full on one taco. Took two home and fried them in a pan later that night to reheat them. Fresh they are great, fried at home for left overs they ROCK!  Fun decor and a real laid back atmosphere. I am just here for the winter so it was very comfy, in the summer it has to be hell as most their seating is outside. Don't miss this one, you cant cook this cheap!

The carne asada was really bad...tons of fat and grissle, I was only able to take 3 bites and I could not do no more. The red beef had good flavor, the problem was that the meat is cooked in a broth, so when they put it in the taco the whole tortilla was soaked and falling apart..I ended up having to pick at it with a fork.  My husband had a carne asada burrito..again the meat was not good and he did not like the cabbage ..it looked old and tasted old.  The service was solid and there are other things that I like about the place...but they need some quality control..who wants to eat fatty carne asada and soggy tacos???   Two hippies if you are out there reading this..please...address some of these issues, I really want to come back.",

    "text": "I went in expecting a very nice fish taco, but the porridge/mush that passed for fish was fishy and nasty... how's that for the start of a review?  Ok, the place is nicely enough furnished if you think a la chuy's or chipotle's metal furnishings but with more crap on the walls.  It's clean, the people were pleasant and nice and the counter service fine.  The wife ordered a hotdog, i'm sure she'll review that.  I wasn't impressed.  But let's get to the rest of the food.  I ordered the 3 pack of tacos for $5.  Ok price.    Green beef, pork and fish.  All of them came wrapped in aluminum foil with sticky but cold flour tortillas and the same mess of cabbage, tomato and white and yellow cheese.  All were freezing cold which made the meat luke warmish.    They were all a miss for me.  I would not step back in this place for a taco.  Fatty pork is fine, if its cooked nicely, but this was not. Green beef was ok, as long as I piled the pretty good tomatillo salsa over it.  The fish...let's leave it at ugh.  If this is their specialty, it's over already.    This is Sunnyslope, and with the authentic delicious taco and burrito choices around here, this place is only competing with the tacos across the street at Jack in the Box, and I would probably eat those before I'd touch another one of these, it was that bad for me.  Sorry, hippies.   This wasn't good.  If you are going to come into a Mexican part of town you'd better bring the meat to compete.  You are far outclassed in taco land.  So, after some thought I decided rather than just pan the place, I'm giving suggestions:   1. use a paper or wax paper between the aluminum and taco, or you have a mess. 2. do something with that too cold cabbage/cheese/tomato 3.  grill the fish and don't smother it / chop it up.  make sure its fresh. 4.  get a better cut of pork, go organic (maybe it is), season it better 5.  keep the happy people in front, they were nice 6.  don't blend your lemonade with ice, it was awful and too sweet 7.  quit buying your chips at Costco, those round ones suck 8.  do something with the guacamole, it was ok just being avocado and lime, but it was pureed.  keep it chunky. 9.  get more input from your mexican chefs, they probably know what is wrong 10. Both the red and green salsas were good, just need a taco to go with it.",

    "text": "I was out running a couple of errands last week and a friend called and suggested lunch at Two Outraged Hippies Taco's and Beach something:)  I hadn't been to a Two Hippies for a couple of years...I think it was their burger joint...that one didn't make much of an impression on me either way :-I  But I thought to myself...well, I like lunch:)  And, I like taco's:)  And I was a hippie of the first water back in my day (which, BTW, means that it's no longer \"My Day\", sadly:(  But I'm not thrilled by Two Hippies taco's:(  I got dos taco's...a chicken and a carne asada, along with a can of soda pop...the people taking my $5.00 cash were very nice (and they were trying to dress up like hippies or something, too!...too adorable for words:)  I didn't get fish taco's...experience (the kind gained through trial and many, many errors)...has taught me that the only place that I really like to get fish tacos, is from one of the beach palapa's in Bahia de Navidad...where the panga's pull right up on the sand...the fishermen jump out and hand the cook in the palapa a red snapper or dorado or something else with fins...they clean it, cut it up, grill it, throw some lettuce and homemade salsa on it and it's a taco about 30 minutes after it quit swimming:)  Those are pretty good fish taco's...esp. washed down with a cerveza or three:)...I don't remember the name of the place...probably \"taco de playa\" or something...just walk down the beach...you can't miss it:)  10 pesos each for the taco's, 25 pesos a pop for the cerveza...it's a very good deal:)...BTW, that doesn't include round-trip first class airfare or the Governors Suite at the Grand Bay:)  No beach at 5th and Camelback:(  But, I digress:)  I liked the service and the price (and I really appreciate the staff trying to look like hippies for me...really...a blast from past:)  I really didn't care for the food, itself...outrageous has a number of different connotations, depending on context...but I didn't find the taco's \"outrageous\" in any sense of the word:)  Although nowhere near as bad as Skip & Jan's attempt at taco's, the hippies taco's leave more than a bit to be desired...the carne asada was dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they give you in the little plastic cups didn't really improve things.  So I tried the chicken taco and found it to be dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they gave...!  Hey wait a minute...did they just give me two of the same thing and try to call them something different?!?!?...  That would be so like the hippies I knew back in the `60's and `70's:-)...always stoned, never quite sure what they were doing...so much fun to watch:)  But no, they gave me carne asada and chicken...the taco's just looked and tasted very much alike (the chicken was somewhat whiter, but other than that...not much difference:(  In Phoenix, a city with so many options for getting my taco fix, even the nostalgia for times long gone (and thankfully so...can you imagine a world in which all we want to do is sit around all day, get high, and make love...not war...where would we all be? :-) can't make up for these lackluster offerings:(  There are tons of better taco shop's...many of which don't even require the plane ride and hotel stay:)",

The first thing I noticed (other than the wonderfully tacky decor) was the decent prices.  Tacos are $1.50 each (tax included).  I went with the Burro.  Honestly If they would have named the place Two Hippies and a Burro, I would have enjoyed myself more.  But Beachhouse is fine too, I guess.  The guy taking orders is the owner himself.  He owns the Magic Mushroom place down on Indian School too.  I think its refreshing to have the owner taking orders.  Owners know how to do it right!  He asked me my first name and scribbled it onto a brown bag. NOW I'm diggin this place!  He was calling regulars up with nicknames like Snowman Steve, and Sarge.  I wanna be a regular to find out what awesome alter-persona he labels me.  Knowing my luck, he'd name me Conehead Chris or Corporate Chris or something else I wouldn't like. I wanna be Snowball Steve!  The wait was long. 25 minutes long! Standing around staring at other people waiting. *Check watch* shuffle feet *Check watch*... Then I hear \"CHRIS!!! PATIO PICKUP!\"  Wtf?!?! Wheres the patio?  So I get my food and scarf it down.  Carne Asada... not spiced for a typical burrito... Cabbage??? To say the least, it was pretty damn good.  For $4, you can't go wrong!  Next time I'll just get 2 tacos...  I'll be back, Mr. Hippy...",

Tacos are cheap. And lard-free. And you get them in brown bags like old school lunchtime. Memories.  Green and red chili beef may harken Christmas but not as cheery. Something missing.

Who eats Sriracha on tacos? I guess I do today. And so does  half of the Phoenix Fire Department and real estate marketers Biff and Landon who look eerily like Lerner & Rowe.  Venue: A beach shack.

An impossible destination for the westbound traveler at 4 in the afternoon. For eastbound drivers on Camelback are infinite. Beware. Or you will have long loud conversations with yourself  in the center turn lane.  So have a taco here. Or three. While The Byrds and Stealers Wheel provide you musical accompaniment.

    "text": "OH Dos Hippies....how I wanted to love you sooo much.    I'd been passing this place by due to the long lines around noon, and just biding my time until I too would get to taste the deliciousness.  I should have waited longer.....  I went in on a Friday around 4:30 and there was no line!  I was so excited!  I perused the simple menu and was delighted to find \"Cactus Tacos\".  This is something I grew up eating, we called it 'nopales', and I'd never seen it on a taco menu.  So I ordered two Cactus Tacos with no cheese.  The very nice chick behind the counter said that the Cactus was prepared fresh daily and mixed with feta cheese.  Okay, I'm not lactose intolarant, just watching calories, so I said that would be fine, just no extra cheese.  She suggested I get three tacos, but I stuck with two, glad I did.  I then paid $1.00 for a can of diet pepsi. $1.00!!!? Get fountain drinks, please.  I waited less than 3 minutes to pick up my tacos from the patio window in the back and sat down amongst a bunch of happily chewing people.  I was excited!  The size of the tacos was great!  I was really happy I only got two, b/c I wouldn't be able to fit in three. I also noticed that there was shredded cheddar on them, even though I'd asked for no extra cheese.  I took off as much as I could and didn't think much about it.  As I picked up the first taco, I thought, 'wow, these seem cold...omg, these *are* cold.'  Who eats cold tacos?  The nopales (prickly pear cactus) were ice cold. ice cold.  The flour tortillas were also cold, the only thing that wasn't cold were the lukewarm pinto beans.  Okay.. I'm half-mexican and will eat a lot of things in a tortilla, almost anything, but I have never been served cold nopales.  Okay, I decided to give it a try, because I'm willing to try anything once. The first bite was crunchy and my intial thought was \"holy crap they didn't clean the cactus of needles!\"  then I realized the crunchiness was merely from the *partially-cooked* rice that was in the taco.  I opened up both tacos, scooped the uncooked rice out and finished them.   I wanted to like this place so badly!  Why, oh why couldn't you have been amazing?!  I may be too forgiving, but I'm willing to go back and try one of their hot dogs....but give me some time......",

    "text": "I'm writing this review today without having read any previous reviews of this place. I did not seek it out, rather stopped in for lunch today because my girlfriend had been here many times and suggested it.  To start with, I don't throw 5 stars out there very often. Actually, I don't think anyone does. However, this place is such a little gem I believe that it deserves high marks for the service they offer.  My girlfriend and I each got a chicken taco and a carne asada taco. Let me just say that the portions alone, for 2 bucks a pop, are more than average. Add on top of that, the fact that they come stacked with rice and beans and loads of cheese and you've got a great bargain. I will say that I did not enjoy the chicken taco quite as much as I did the carne asada, which means I will probably just stick with the latter in the future.   I had the privilege of meeting the owner as he stopped by our table to talk with us a bit about some of the changes he's made (more shade on the patio, misting system, etc.) and the newest addition to his restaurants, a breakfast joint, which he says will open sometime in mid July 09 and seat around 100. This is good news, I think, because there is not much seating here or at his burger joint. And although, they have no problem packing them in, even during these hard times, he was very grateful to be doing so well and hoped to see us again. He was very pleasant to talk to and also very accessible.  So let's talk about the service itself. You might think that a little dive place like this, selling $2 tacos (or 3 for $5) might just want to take your order and push you on through like cattle, trying to serve as many people as possible with very little personality or courtesy. That could not be further from reality here. The kid taking our order at the register apologized for blinking too much, saying that the grill was kicking out a little more smoke than usual. Another kid who brought our tacos outside to us was very polite, to the extent of saying thank you for coming and how they appreciate our business. Now c'mon, these are just kids. Usually you would expect quite the opposite but we felt very welcome.  The menu consisted of all sorts of tacos, burritos and even hot dogs. It seems they had an extensive assortment of lemonades, as well but we chose sodas. Parking is limited. The order comes out very quickly and for all of this, I love this place and will be returning.  It's great to have a restaurant like this that is locally owned, very easy on the wallet AND the food is delicious! I would encourage anyone to stop in and see for themselves. Maybe we'll see ya there!",

    "text": "Soooooo close to a perfect 5/5 stars for me.  The shrimp tacos..... Lord have mercy. Best shrimp tacos I have ever had. The chicken taco was also delicious.  BUT... check this... out of 3 of the tacos I had (shrimp, chicken & asada) the least impressive was the carne asada. Isn't that sorta ironic?! I guess this place isn't really for carne asada lovers..... BUT IT'S OKAY BECAUSE THE SHRIMP & CHICKEN TACOS..... totally enough for me to come back.  I literally bit into my shrimp & chicken tacos, groaned & closed my eyes. Those tacos alone are 5/5 stars.  Howeverrrrrrrrrr womp womp womp.... I asked for green salsa.... I got two very tiny little sauce packets :( come on man. I need like 2 per taco!!!! They're full sized tacos. Not the small taqueria tacos. Ugh. And the other let down.... the carne asada which I will pretend like it never happened.  Prices are actually really reasonable. I love it. Seating is only outdoor so just grab your food togo unless you don't mind sitting outside in the heat.  Final verdict: IN LOVE. I'll be back. I need to try the fish tacos, but the shrimp & chicken tacos are soooOoOoOoo good, I can't wait to come back :-)",

Growing up in California I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to tacos, but I could literally place this place in Santa Cruz California. I had the carne asada, green chili, and grilled fish taco. They were very good! I especially loved the fish taco! So much so that we decided to order another three for later. My six year old had the bean burrito and ate the whole thing.   The customer service was fantastic. They were friendly, even joked around with my son, and overall had a good vibe. It really made me feel at home and brought back the California vibes.",

There's trivia games on the table, bright colored seating on one side, and cool decor every where. My first visit there was a long out the door, but it went quickly. Seems to be a lot of regulars which told me right away it was going to be tasty. The smell of the food made my mouth water and by the time it was my turn I asked for some ideas and the owner told me what tacos were most popular. She made everything sound awesome so I ordered them all  let me just tell you I've been back 5 more times since then in a very short time and brought friends. Everything is perfect, service is wonderful, and with the misters around the outside seating it's perfect even in the heat of the day. My daughter loved the picture opportunities and the tacos as well. Next visit we'll try the burritos. The shrimp tacos right now are my favorite! Yummy!",

My wife ate about 1/2 of her red and brought the rest home.  Later that night she went to finish the last 1/2 of her red burro.  Well she found a piece of cardboard that was folded up in her burro.  It was about an 1' by 1' folded up.  I have never written a review on yelp before and I have never found a non-food item in my food before.  My wife called the owner that night.  All he said was thanks.  My wife told him he should check through all of the red burro meat.  Although the food was good, the way this was handled was not.  I won't ever be going back here.",

    "text": "There used to be a time when I would have given Two Hippies five stars, but their prices have gone up and quality has gone down (only slightly) since then.  I am still enamored with their carne asada and cactus tacos, as well as with their ginormous tortas. For the minimal price and speedy service, it is a huge step up on the scale of \"Mexican Fast Food.\" (I'm writing this review with the thoughts that Two Hippies can be judged alongside Taco Bell, Berto's and Del Taco as a more-or-less Americanized fast-food taco joint.)  If you understand portion sizing, the portions are perfect. A torta could easily be split between two people (at least, two young women who aren't voraciously hungry. Men, you could probably get your own and finish it.) Two tacos with your choice of main filling plus cabbage, beans and rice is enough to fill you up pretty well.   You can tell the ingredients are fresh and high quality. The cabbage is crunchy, the hot sauce has a nice kick, and the beans are seasoned perfectly.  If you're looking for a sweet treat to go with your tacos or torta, take a sip of the prickly pear lemonade that they offer, or buy one of their \"special brownies.\"",

The food might taste better if the atmosphere and decor didn't get your hopes up. When you walk in to any of their locations you can't help to be excited about the possibility of falling in love with another trendy downtown restaurant, only to be disappointed. It's like a date with someone you met on Facebook who had a really interesting about me section and who's display picture portrayed them as a model, only to find out they're just average in real life.",

Today, we were out running errands and got hungry so decided to come here. I'm glad we did!  I had the pesto-mayo/feta/etc hot dog. It was delicious, and they put two dogs in a bun, so it's a ton of food. I've been jonesing for a good hot dog ever since Maui Dog closed, and this will probably be a good replacement for it! They throw in a little bag of chips too, I got regular Sun Chips, but my boyfriend stole them from me.  I also had a frozen lemonade, with passionfruit. First taste and it reminded me of another thing I miss dearly, Fruitopia!  My boyfriend had just a plain hot dog. He got ketchup and mustard for it too. He enjoyed it, but I think he secretly liked my dog better. He got FunYuns as his chip choice, but regretted it so I ended up eating them.  All in all, $10 spent on a good amount of food.  You can BYOB there too, which is awesome. I think next time we go we'll be bringing some kind of drank. :)",

    "text": "We want to start this review by saying we would give this place 10 out of 5 stars if we could. We've lived in the Uptown area for a while and had driven past this place several times but never made the time to check it out. HUGE MISTAKE! Now that we've experienced this magical little Mexican food haven tucked behind a VW van we CANNOT STOP TALKING ABOUT IT. We have both spent a lot of time in southern California, so we'd like to think we know good Mexican food...Two Hippies Beach House is the textbook definition. This place has a great menu with lots to choose from and offers everything at a price that doesn't leave your wallet crying and telling you to live on instant ramen for the rest of the month.  Naty (The Veggie Perspective): First off let me say that I'm a vegetarian who LOVES Mexican food. Sadly the usual veggie options at most Mexican restaurants consist of replacing meat with beans, lettuce, and cheese...WHERE ARE ALL THE OTHER VEGETABLES?! I ordered the Loaded Quesadilla with Cactus Strips and it was *life changing*! Who knew something so pokey and prickely could be so delicious?!?!?!  Drew (The Omnivore Perspective (I Eat Everything)): First off I just want to say that the portion sizes here are awesome for the price, and the staff were great too! I ordered a chicken burrito with a guava slushy, and both were delicious. The burrito had the perfect ratio of meat to veggies and rice and beans. I really liked how Two Hippies includes the Mexican cabbage slaw in their burritos, it really reminded me of food I had in San Diego. Their house salsas were awesome, full of flavor, and not too spicy. The guava slushy was amazing, and just the thing I needed on a hot day.  N&D: Great tasting food for reasonable prices. Awesome atmosphere and staff. Why are you still reading? Go! Go now!",

So these tacos were like mini burritos as they had rice, beans, meat, and cheese in flour tortillas.   In order of yumminess:  Fried Fish taco-  can't go wrong here and it was served traditionally with no surprises. (Fish, cabbage, creamy sauce with a chipotle kick)  Green Chili Shredded Beef- pretty tasty!  I would choose this over the asada.  It also makes me curious about their red chili shredded beef...  Carne Asada- it was ok.  Lacked some flavor, was a tad dry, and a lil chewy.  Let's be real, tacos are not the easiest things to eat.     Ergo, if it has all the contents of a burrito, tastes like a burrito, and is in a flour tortilla like a burrito....might as well save the \"taco head tilt\" and get a burrito.   That's what I will probably be coming back for.",

I want to love them for the $6 / three tacos meal, but my GI system seems to say otherwise. I've had different combinations of tacos here with varying success, and since I'm no masochistic I must gracefully withdraw my name from ballot for \"Duke of the Beach House.\" - no write in's, please.  Maybe it's the enourmose portions per taco, or perhaps the combination of spices used when cooking the beef. Maybe it was the rice, or extra sliced jalepenos I always ask for. Either way, the food had a good taste, and a great price, but just doesn't agree with my sensitive 'personality'; I guess. :-/  Alas, I live to fight the good (food) fight in this ever lasting battle.

    "text": "I really dig this place. A nice little gem in the mix of all of these low quality spots in Phoenix. I'm not a fan of buffets for obvious reasons and don't like supporting franchised businesses.   The Pros:  1.  Great food in general. They don't over season their food to mask good flavors. Really nice balance and a nice touch by using cabbage instead of iceberg lettuce. By the way, lettuce has no nutritional value at all. It's a cheap filler used to rip off customers. Cabbage is full of great nutrition and eventually full of farts if you eat too much of it. The burritos are monstrous. I would eat half and then save it for later on in the day. Really great price for good food.  3.  Unique daily specials. It's worth coming back each day to check what they've dreamed up. The daily drinks are flavored with Monin, which is a simple syrup flavoring. So good.  2.  Very friendly staff who keep it simple. Order your food, they write it down on a paper bag, you get your food from the window in the back seating area. There's a good amount of parking as well. If an order isn't up to par just let them know and they'll fix it for you.  4.  I love the decor of this place. It oozes the laid-back vibe of a taco stand. You have no choice but to eat outside in the fresh air instead of inside of a stale place.",

My girlfriend and I really loaded up:  Together: a order (very good amount) of chips and red salsa and a quesadilla  She: 3 fish tacos with cabbage and sauce and a little pico de gallo with a raspberry lemonade to drink.  Me: a fish taco with the cabbage, sauce and pico and a carne asada burrito with pico, rice and beans with a Mountain Dew.  (All together that food was $25! We were stunned! Such great value.)  When we ordered, my girlfriend was asked if she wanted the fish tacos fried or grilled and she said grilled, but received fried.  She didn't mind in the least and from the first bite she was over the moon with how good the tacos were and I have to agree.  They were so delicious and it seems to be what they are well know for.  The sauce had a little more kick to it than I was expecting.  Not a bad thing, just wasn't expecting that heat.  The burrito was massive. So delicious, the only tiny tiny tiny complaint was that either the beans or pico in the burrito had cilantro and I am not a huge fan of the cilantro.    Overall it was such a great vibe and delicious food.  Before even getting up from the table we had decided that it was our go to Mexican food place.  My girlfriend even ordered a burrito to go for lunch the next day!  Don't drive past this place one more time, without trying it!",

The only lying reason I didn't give them 5 starts is because the target of has a bean and rice base that the fish sits on top of and then has a cream and salad with cheese over it, all of which seemed to over power the fish flavor and made me feel like I was eating a stuffed fish burrito.  It was still good though, but not what I was after when I ordered the tacos.",

Oh sure, So Cal has good tacos, but to find beach-side tacos here, you gotta go... Well, to the beach! Which in LA traffic, forget about it.  I think the nicest thing about Two Hippies Beach House was how the owners made a daring move setting up a fish taco restaurant in the middle of the DESERT. And somehow not only survived but brought in a huge following of customers!  Whenever I came here I got one of each taco. That's a lot of tacos, considering they've got so many different varieties!  You know a SoCal fish taco place has good tacos when they serve every taco with lime.  Few gripes I have with this place: they put beans in their tacos which is kinda weird for me. Also, you can't buy beer there, but you can bring your own beer, apparently.",

I got a burrito to go here today after realizing I work like right down the street from it! I got the cactus burrito which is their vegetarian option. At first I thought they forgot the cactus because I ate half my burrito and no cactus in sight, but it was all bunched up in the bottom half. I ended up taking some out because it was too much. I think next time I will omit the cactus. Also they forgot to ask me black or pinto beans and just gave me pinto. I didn't think to ask, next time I'll request black beans!  The people working here are nice and my food was ready super fast. And at only $6 that was a pretty hearty meal that will keep me full for quite some time! Another pro of the burrito, it doesn't fall apart all over as you try to eat it. Makes car eating slightly less dangerous. I'd love to come back, maybe try a loaded quesadilla, and bring more people to check it out!",

    "text": "Ever since new management took over about 6 years ago, this place has lost its focus on customer service. Went to pick up tacos for my girlfriend and was told the wait would be about 10 minutes. No problem. At the 15 minute mark, I became curious but realized they were busy. Around the 20 minute mark and seeing people with food that were behind me in line, I decided to get back in line to question them. Another customer that was originally behind me gets in line behind me again (I could hear her complain that her order was incomplete). The owner looks past me and at the girl to see what was wrong. I quickly interjected and stated that I was before her and this was my second time in line. When I walked up the manager greeted me like it was my first time in. She had just seen me 20 minutes ago. My order was sitting on a table, out of sight from the grill line and manager. She said \"oh I thought this was to go?\" To which the line cook responded, \"it was to go...\" and it was bagged to go. No apology, no attempt to correct the situation. Their lack of awareness and care have lost them a customer. Do yourself a favor and get far better tacos at Ladera.",

The menu is simple - tacos, and.... I think that's it - and super cheap tacos at that.  I'm talking like almost Taco Bell cheap.  And no disrespect to the great people of Taco Bell who practically raised me - but these are in an entirely different league.  So great, in fact, that I just have to overlook nearly all your other imperfections (like the bathroom door that doesn't lock, and those sticky old tablecloths.)  I must say though, True hippies would NEVER so sacrilegiously destroy a beautiful Kombi, cut it in half, and put it on display in front of their beach house like you did.  Lame!  I'm disappointed two hippies.  But I'll still come for the tacos.",

The restaurant itself is very cool...stepping inside to order and waiting on the side porch and or back porch for your food is for a moment like being transported to Venice Beach or Mission Beach in Cali.  But alas visions of California soon recede (and you snap back to the the fact that...damn...I am still in Phoenix) once you eat the food here. The portions for the taco's and burros are large but oh so bland.  I had to drench a vegetarian burro I ordered with green sauce to get any flavor and even then it was still a bland meal.  There are much better taco and burrito shops in downtown Phoenix  (La Condesa Taco Shop is best I have been at in Phoenix so far...have to do a review soon) so look around and don't get sucked into Two Hippies just for the scenery.",

Eclectic bunch of seating and art -I believe it's an order at the counter kinda place.   The burrito bowl was very, very delicious. I could have ate it again. I've had this place bookmarked for about 2 years, and so glad to have finally tried it! I'd be happy to return again!",

The incredible ambiance/scene draws you in (not to mention the BYOB sign) and its the service and food that will bring me back for a long, long time. I asked for suggestions and without missing a beat was recommended one of the specials, the Thai Peanut Shrimp Burrito. One of the most incredible burritos I have ever had, the taste was unique, complex, and a new type of delicious from the first bite to the last. My girlfriend ordered Fish tacos with a Mango-Habanero sauce. Simple, filling, and tasty as well! We were both incredibly satisifed, and such cheap prices...? Cmon! It doesnt get much better.",

The owner John and his wife have only owned it for about a month now and it seems like it's been years for them. They just flow so smoothly with the customers and really make you feel special. The food is out of this world! I try to try all the different things on the menu but my heart is set on the rice bowl with cactus In it... Cactus!!!!!  Not to mention they have Lavender lemonade that's to die for!! I truly love this place and my roommate and I eat here once a week! It's a good little treat for us.

My advice, though: Do not come to this specific location on a school day around 3:00. All of the Xavier students are just getting out of school and SWAMP this place. It's already extremely crammed in the front of the building. Do not put yourself in a crammed building with 25 15-year old school girls... it is extremely hard to move.",

My husband can eat all 3, but I barely make it through 2.  The best part is that they use cabbage instead of lettuce, so it makes the whole taco less soggy and more crunchy (though it's made on a soft tortilla).  The ONLY downside is that they accept cash only (but they do have an ATM machine inside).  I'm a casual girl from the NW, so if you're looking for a casual locale, cheap but good tacos, homemade smoothies, and a beer, head over to Two Hippies.  Best in town!",

Now to the food.....I ordered 3 fish tacos (happen to be the special of the day). They were absolutely delicious!  I traded 1 taco to my daughter in exchange for 1 of her  carne asada tacos.  Both tacos were so good!  Fish tacos were my favorite!  My other 2 kids had the other special of the day - buffalo chicken burritos, which they modified for their picky eating to just chicken, rice and cheese.  The burrito was toasted on both sides (not greasy at all, just toasted).  Of course I had to try a bit of their burrito.  It was so good!  (didn't have the full fixings: cabbage, and pico but still excellent)  Service was great and quick and friendly.  I even went back to the counter just  to tell them how delicious their food was and chatted for a little bit.  The atmosphere was perfect!    I am now craving their food!    They are down the road from Grand Canyon Univ too so all you students head out there.  Support local businesses!!!!!  Affordable and delicious!!!",

I might not have known about the rear delivery system if I had not already wondered by it earlier.  I received my tacos, but my soda was missing when they called my name.  I mentioned it to very friendly lady that delivered my food and she promptly got it for me.  I ordered a green meat, a red meat and a chicken taco.  All three tacos came individually wrapped in foil and came in a brown paper bag.  It also came with both green and red sauces.  All three came with soft flour tortilla wrappings. I am not a fan of flour tortillas for tacos because I usually prefer the street style with corn tortillas.  The tables also had El Pato Sauce and another hot sauce for your pleasure, although I am not sure they keep them refrigerated?  The flavor, temperature, and the taste of the meat tacos were fine.  I was surprised to find beans in all 3 tacos, but they added nice texture and flavor.  The green and red meat tacos were pretty good, but did not stand out as something that I would crave on a Saturday night after a few brews.  The chicken taco had huge cubes of white chicken meat.  The chicken drowned out the other flavors in the taco (actually too much chicken).  Overall, a pretty cool eclectic place that I would try again.",

It said \"outrageous\" and the joint itself had distinctive designs from the 70s that stood out like a sore thumb in this hoody part of 16th St.    I usually research a place before trying but this was a random stop by with a risk level of safe.  How could you go wrong with Tacos and Burritos, right? Well, it wasn't all that terrible but at the same time it lacked authenticity by miles.   The interior decor was exactly what you would expect from a pot smoking hippie with posters of Jimi Hendrix, Rolling Stones, and Bob Marley plastered literally every inch of the neon green interior walls and ceiling.  I very much appreciated all the colorful details that was incorporated to express the character of the establishment.  The design department deserved 5-stars for sure!  Coming here, I was a bit hungry so I opted for their 3-pack tacos. Of the six toppings or so, I went with their Green Beef, Carne Asada, and Fish. The key attribute about their Tacos is their enormous size. As I was picking my order up, I seriously thought I was carrying back THREE burritos! I was overwhelmed with each taco as they were HEAVILY packed with chilled, diced cabbage and tomatoes. It was a one-to-three ratio of meat to vegetables, which explains the size and weight, right? They packed a fork and knife but I ate it True street style via hand. My eating experience was just a complete mess, literally.   The abnormally massive size could not compensate for the quality. The shredded Green Beef was a little dry with simple Mexican flavors. I was hoping the Carne Asada would save the day, but still fell short. The tortilla was nothing special. It had a generic store taste to it than of an authentic hand made. I cannot review the Fish right now, as I took it back with me on the road. I was too full from the bland, uncreative flavors that one would have expected otherwise.",

    "text": "Just stopped in for a taco or two (or who am I kidding? when it's three tacos for $6 you buy three tacos) I got the grilled fish, the green chili beef and the pork. It's kind of a choose your own adventure when you order three tacos and since I start and finish on the same taco, I had to pick my favorite child. I started with the fish taco, you know the Olive Barragan of Tacos. It was very tasty. They put rice and cabbage and a Chipotle sauce on it. It was a solid taco. I then went to taco #2, the green chili beef. This guy was so very tasty. This was the taco that solidified my return to this place. Having tried their salsa out on the fish taco o decided that their green was the tastiest and put some on taco #2. Happy day. Finally my pork taco. It was a great end to the meal. I washed it down with a blended strawberry lemonade which was $3, a little pricey but they got me to fall for then with the three tacos for six bucks hiw could I say no. Tip these guys is my last bit of advice. They're sweating hard in the 110 AZ heat. The outside searing has some solid mist going and fans so you stay cool but those boys earn their tips. Oh yeah good atmosphere and lots of fun stuff to look at.",

The atmosphere is awesome and the staff was great!!! Very good customer service. Not to mention the food was amazing!!! If you want some authentic fresh mexican food you have  go to Two Hippies Beach house. And if you have a sweet tooth you have to try their fresh baked brownies! BEST brownie I have ever had!!:: If we are ever back in Phoenix we defintely be coming back!!",

But when you order the lemonade for $3, it's 95% crushed ice & comes with a cute little umbrella in the straw, well this part is a \"rip off!\" \"Seriously! \"  I usually order differnt Tacos & they are good! All the ingredients are fresh...The  fish, carne asada and chicken are my favorites.   The green and red salsas are tasty. Also freshly made  If I didn't feel so ripped off on the lemonade, & I've made this mistake several times, I would give this place Five Stars!",

I've had mexican food in Minnesota and I'm pretty sure it had more character than this local gem. Sorry Two Hippies, you have a solid concept going but your menu needs a serious overhaul.",

Three tacos for 6 bucks is a deal, but I would rather go to Tacobell and get something crunchy and at least seasoned appropriately for the money. Not a lot of vegetarian options unless you like eating straight up cheese. Seriously, I would never go back.",

    "text": "finally! the place slowed down a bit to stop in for a quick bite. it was MLK day, so i thought the crowd would be obsolete, NOT SO! it slowed for a minute, kinda like the waters parting, and then as i placed my order, and had a chat with Andy, the line swelled up again!!!! He said its all been done organically, no advertising, just word of mouth. Must be the BIG A_S tacos. They are litterally bursting with food. I tried the 3 pack of fish tacos. The fish was tender and delicious, however the rice and beans inside the taco was a new twist (next time that goes on the side!) that is where the filling comes from. I'm more of a fish, lettuce, cheese, salsa and lemon fish-taco-kinda-girl so the place only got a 3. However i'm sure on my second visit, the one where there won't be any rice or beans in my taco, will be a deliciously heaven like trip. If your a salsa freak (like my seester & I) this salsa is not for you. neither the green or red is tasty or hot, think salsa for americans.   its so close to my place too! kudos on the local, glad the previous boutique moved (otherwise where would this tiny all inclusive place be?)  on a side note; the owner and his bro are the creators of Long Wongs Wings and Hippy Brother Burgers and they still have it!!! The place is a kitschy place. You go Andy ^_~ hope they come to Grand Avenue soon......",

So I informed the young girl at the counter i was unhappy with the tortillas and she pointed to a VERY SMALL sign that said corn tortillas now available. . woohoo   We are in Arizona for Christ's sake . . tacos normally come in corn tortillas. . . flour should be the second choice.  So she charged me for a couple corn tortillas that were old and dry . . they tore in two when i folded them. .

I will say that the staff is super friendly, and the service was very good.  But for me, when I eat out it's all about the food, and it was not that tasty.  It was cheap, for sure, but I've had cheap, delicious food before and this was not it.  I ordered the blackberry lemonade and their special burrito of the day, a chicken burrito with green chile.  The lemonade tasted like cotton candy, and it wasn't actually a drink; it was a slushy.  The chicken burrito was pretty dry, and was filled with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and what looked like kraft shredded cheese.  It's my fault for not asking what all came on the burrito, but I HATE shredded lettuce.  I had to struggle to find any green chile, and when I did, it didn't pack a lot of flavor.  I wish I could recommend it, but I probably won't eat there again.",

While waiting, roamed around the outside ... seating area could be laid out better.  Order took only a few minutes and my name was called for pick up.  Was suprised at the weight of the taco and burrito  ... felt substantial.  Tried the fish taco first.  It smelled and tasted fishy (not in a good way).  Very poorly seasoned fish cooked in dish water.  The (flour) taco was loaded with a tasteless mash of beans, lettuce, rice, none of which were very appealing.  Looking forward to the carne asada burrito, I was almost equally disappointed.  Almost no meat, and what there was of it tasted like old  pot roast that had been steamed into a tasteless mush.  Again, the burrito was filled with beans, rice and lettuce, but nothing was properly flavored.  The  tortilla itself tasted old and didn't hold together well, allowing most of the innards to fall out ... you know, when you've let them sit out on the counter for too long.  Ended up throwing away 1/2 of the taco and burrito ... something I rarely do.  The fresh lemonade tasted like koolaid with slush.  Definitely not worth the $3 price.  Food prices are cheap, portions large, but quality and taste are not lacking.  Two thumbs down!  If you want a cheap Mexican fix that tastes good, try La Salsita on Indian School and 32nd Street.  Great carne asada and slow cooked pork.",

You can choose those items in a taco, burrito, nachos, and anything Green Chile is good, I always get Green Chile Nachos, as an appetizer, I absolutely love them. If you order a burrito bring an appetite the are huge. You can go by there menu or, order to your liking. The only thing is that, you can only eat outside.  So, if you order in the summer months, order to go. They do have misters though. So, don't let that stop from trying this place. You won't be disappointed. Price are reasonable, considering how good the food is. Customer Service is pretty darn good too. One time we went and the line was massive and they got our food under 20 minutes.",

I've read other reviews that the tacos aren't \"authentic\" style tacos. In their defense, that's not what they're going for. These are beach tacos. Exactly the same as you could get in Hermosa Beach, Venice, Santa Monica, etc. This place should be on The Strand in Hermosa, that's how close they are to the beach taco stands I've frequented in So Cal. They also have great burritos. Everything is made fresh, from the beans to the salsa's. Ask for the volcano sauce, it's ridiculously hot, but very flavorful. The owners are so cool and personable, just all around nice people to talk to. The place usually is very busy, but the line goes quick. Awesome beach vibe and decor all around property. So if you want street tacos, this is NOT your place, but if you want fresh, delicious beach tacos, then look no further. I will be back indefinitely! So great to find a place like this, so far from the ocean!",

First off start with the flour tortilla then add the battered covered fish that is then deep fried to perfection. Add cabbage, cheese, peco and drizzle the secret sauce. Then top off the gloriousness that is with some lime, add green and red salsa ( dont pick either or just believe in me and do both). Proceed to eat until you explode. Guaranteed best fish taco you shove in your mouth no bull. On top of that the staff is friendly and the food is relatively cheap. Kudos to you Two Hipps.",

The price was great--6$ for 3 tacos and I left filling full. You could taste the different flavors in the tacos. The environment and decor is fun and really unique. Would definitely recommend,can't wait to eat here again. The only reason not 5 stars is because I'll have to bring my own hot sauce next time. I like my tacos really spicy,but the sauce was to way too mild for my tasting.",

    "text": "Love this place. Love the guy, he is super friendly and love the food (for what it costs .. 3 huge tacos for $6 even, including tax).  Yes, the chicken could be a little spicier or red or something but it's not bad at all.   Tacos come with your favorite meat, beans, onions, chopped cabbage and tomato and melted cheddar cheese. Tacos come (VERY IMPORTANT) individually wrapped in a piece of foil with a (very important too) a fresh and green (not old and brown) wedge of lime.  I like each taco wrapped individually in a piece of foil because otherwise they will get very messy and wet like those tacos at Chipotle restaurant, I love them but I hate the wet messy tacos Chipotle has).  Any way, tacos come inside a paper brown bag packed with two different salsas on the side (red and green).   This place has a fabulous outdoor and sadly dusty patio where you can eat your tacos. Imagining yourself sitting in some place in Puerto Vallarta with an ocean view, except, of course, the view here is Camelback Rd.   They also have dozens of magazines for you to read while waiting/eating your food. I should also point out those magazines are current and not from 1985. I sat next to a Architectural Digest magazine and it's the same issue currently sold at the store right now.   The only downside of this place is that they do not offer fountain drinks. You must buy a 12oz can of soda or beer.   If you are a pro like me, you stop at QuikTrip or McDonalds first to buy a large size soda before coming to this place.  You can also follow me on twitter @RexCota :)",

I love the concept of two hippies dropping out and dropping back in as restaurateurs.  What I don't love is the food. The chicken and fish tacos I had were bland. No flavoriing. Thank god they had hot sauce (not homemade, store bought) on the table to spice things up a bit.  On a positive note, the prives were good and the salsa they serve with store-bought chips wasn't bad. And the lemonade (they were out of most flavors both times I visited) was good.   But overall, maybe it's time for the hippies to clean up their act. Worry about the food a little more than the message.",

I tried a pork and a daily special of green chili shredded beef. The pork was better than the beef and both could have used a little seasoning, but I am stuffed! I liked the cabbage, rice, pinto bean mix in the taco along with the 2 choices of salsa and thank goodness for all the napkins as these are messy!   It is quite busy at lunch so it can be a bit of a wait to get your food. But compared to other little lunch haunts, this one actually had enough parking and seating to accommodate all the customers. They also serve different flavored lemonades (blood orange, watermelon etc) which I will be trying next time I come here.   All in all, a solid 3 stars!",

The fish was the best of the three--grilled white fish with a creamy sauce on a flour tortilla with cabbage, tomato cheese, and beans. I prefer grilled to fried fish tacos so this worked for me.   The green chile and red chile shredded beef tacos were good, but I wanted to taste more of the chile sauces in each. Nice tender beef without the lardy taste that you get at some other Mexican food joints.  The tacos tasted fresh and light, never heavy, and I didn't feel bloated or tired after I ate them like some Mexican food take-outs and restaurants. They were pretty big for $1.50; three filled me up.  They've got 12 different kinds of lemonade, but I didn't order any drinks. I wish I had after I saw someone else's watermelon lemonade.   I's not Barrio Cafe, but if you're looking for a fresh, light Mexican lunch that is a local alternative to Chipotle, La Salsa, and Baja Fresh, Two Hippies is the place. I'm a fan.",

Two hippies are on the right track with this place. It's a bit small and it took about 20 min to get my food (they were really busy) but it was worth it. If I lived in Phoenix I would come here daily.   A word about the fish tacos...they are good but seem as though they might use canned fish instead of fresh grilled chunks like most places. Considering the price this is acceptable!  The drinks and baked goods looked great though I haven't yet tried any. I'll save those for next time I'm in town.",

It was excellent, had 3 Pork tacos, chicken burrito (no beans), 1 cheese crisp and 1 brownie for $13.50.00 how does this place stay in business? Well they sure know how to feed the hippie soul and drive away the munchies. Inside there was tons of posters of hippie idols like Jim Morrison, Cheech and Chong, Beetles, etc, and tons of chachkas. Their Pork tacos were done just right and that food was pure joy,  The lady behind the counter looked like 2nd or now 3rd generation hippy with a tie-dye-dead-heads style look. The guy cooking was obviously not hippie.  But the place was cute, the food was great, and the price very hippie-reasonable--you rock \"Two Hippies\"!",

I discover something new every time I go - like the Village People album covers, bumper stickers, action figures and list of 10 worst rock songs.  I love going for lunch and getting a couple of tacos and sharing and order of chips and salsa. The tacos (and burritos) come with pinto beans, cheese, rice, cabbage, tomatoes, onions and a wedge of lime, but nobody squawks when you place a special order. (Big surprise, I 86 the tomatoes.) I've tried the fish, chicken, pork and carne asada tacos, and I think the fish are my favorite while the pork are a close second. The chips are store bought but the salsa makes it worth it. BTW, the tacos are cheap - $2 each.   Their flavored lemonade is the bomb! I think I look for people to meet me there for lunch just so that I can get the blackberry lemonade. Pomegranate and raspberry are pretty tasty, too.  One of these days I need to try the red chili beef burrito...which gives me an excuse to go back.  I recommend carpooling if you're going for lunch.

I ate at THBH two days ago and I've been plotting how many times I can make this excursion each week since. It's SO good.  Managing the cafe, I've learned a lot about food cost margins, and I saw another Yelper mention this in relation to THBH's pricing ($2 loaded tacos!).  And YES, we all need to eat here en masse and buy in BULK so this place can stay profitable enough to feed me!  And why shouldn't we?? This place has delicious food-- all muy fresca!   I ordered two tacos, a Cactus Taco and their daily special-- Artichoke & Black Bean.  For some reason, I half expected them to be in corn tortillas, but I wasn't disappointed when I realized that they actually came in 6\" flour tortillas.  These things were stuffed to the gills, so they were a bit messy-- but I managed to very diligently get most of the food into my mouth.  I can accomplish a lot when I'm focused.  I ordered a blackberry lemonade to accompany my tacos, which was sweet, but tasty.  I think this is a great 'schtick' for the Beach House-- lemonade in something like a dozen flavors.  These folks are right on point thematically with everything they've put together here-- I've seen a few places go under for trying to encompass too many modalities.    To tie a bow on it, FINALLY a place that proves buying local and healthy doesn't mean breaking the bank.  Heart these hippies.",

Beautiful day, so the wait was nice.   I got a chicken, a green chile beef and a pork. All of the tacos have abundant fresh cabbage, whole pintos (!), rice and cheese. But also plenty of meat. The tortillas are fresh and chewy and just the right thickness. No Carolina's here, but pretty good.  The chicken, unfortunately, is grilled, chopped chicken breast. I'm not a fan of that, but if you are, you would likely dig it. I like tender flavorful dark meat. Be cool if dark was an option, but I doubt they're cooking whole chickens. Prolly just breasts. Ate about 2 bites.  The pork was very tender and flavorful. Lacked the crispy edges of a True carnitas-style. Maybe you get lucky sometimes and catch some edges. I ate the whole thing and enjoyed every bite.  The green chile beef had delicious, lean chunks of tender beef. Unlike any green chile I've had. More vinegary, like a Southern pork shoulder. Lacked any punch, although the girl said the green was spicier than the red...? Was pretty tasty, but I really didn't feel like I was eating Mexican food.  I didn't get a burro, but since the fillings were the same, I'm pretty sure it's just more of the same, in a different shape.  I would try the red chile next time, and skip the chicken. Wanted to try the fish, but it's not fried. I like my fish tacos like I like my hippie chicks: hot and crunchy.  The food is more of a 3, but 4 stars for being there, being cool, being fresh tasting. And 4 or 5 for the value - I think myself and another light eater could split the 3-pack, making lunch about $2.25!   Ultimately, this is to Mexican Food what Pita Jungle is to Mediterranean/Middle Eastern. It's really not Mexican, but it is tasty. Like Cali beach food. I wish Yelp could do \"half stars\". Solid 3.5. But I round up because that's how I roll.",

    "text": "So I go out today to find the 2 Hippies magic mushroom and a client tells me there is another 2 Hippies, that just \"popped up over night\" WELL I had to try it.   After driving by, I finally parked in the lot and took a survey of the building.   1. Nice outdoor patio 2. Clean and New 3. Small 4. Looked packed  So I walk in and there was 3 patrons. 2 young guys and 1 US Senator. Yep that is right, a full fledged Senator. Don't ask who because I cannot remember.   So the 3 people made the place looked packed. I told you it was small.   I was greeted right away by the owner. He is a really nice guy who cares about the food he serves. We spoke about the recent call his wife received from DINERS DRIVE INS AND DIVES. She asked the caller to not pull her husbands leg, because he is a huge fan and it would be a thrill to be on the show.   The DDD reviewers spotted 2 Hippies via YELP! She explained he has a 4 star rating and tons of reviews. He was unaware of Yelp but took it as a compliment. ( I bet he looks today) HI!  The food is a healthy Mexican food menu. I sampled the taco trio of fish, beef and chicken. All 3 where wonderful, you sure can taste freshness. The favorite was the fish. $5 with a Coke.  The other items are quesidillas, burritos, tacos, etc.   I tried both the red and the green salsa. The red is boring and the green is good. Neither of them will make you burn your mouth. He is tweaking the salsa so be sure to rate it if it gets better.   I will return when in the area FO SHO.  Well the return was on 10-7-08.   I had the taco trio constisting of green beef taco, carne asada taco and red chile taco. They were all good but the green was the best of the 3.  The salsa needs a makeover. I was hoping for a better flavor this time. The green is good but sweet, the red is bad. Maybe a little \"mexican\" in it wouldn't be bad.   Do not go here expecting greasy, gut  buster, cheese covered everything MEXICAN food. Go here expecting a healthier, fresh tasting meal. The food is prepared by a fat white guy and cooked by a Mexican guy. (not that that matters, my mom-in-law makes killer mexican food and she is white)",

I ordered the fish taco and the carna asada taco with green chile.  My tortillas were falling apart from the grease and from the large quantity of the meat, cheese, and cabbage.  That was not too bad but the flavor or the tacos were just plain salty.  So salty that I really couldn't enjoy the beef in my taco.  I tried the fish taco and the fish was \"sick\" as in not well, and ill.  That's what I call fish when they have this fishy smell that's beyond the normal fish smell.  I know my fish, trust me (I'm Asian okay) and the fish in my taco was just not right.    Granted the tacos were cheap and the quantity was large; however,  I rather pay more and eat a fish taco that is \"not sick.\"",

I must say, it is not reasonable to have your salivary glands dry up after a bite of fish taco, or chicken taco.   In sum... some items here are outrageously salted and give you outrageous high blood pressure.   Oh, I'll give an additional star for the availability of sriracha.",

    "text": "Not bad for a couple of white guys opening up a Mexican joint! I guess the words Mexican and joint back-to-back can be misleading! So I'll rephrase that with Hippie style restaurant with a hint of Mexican food. They definitely have Mexicans in the kitchen cooking so you can trust this place knows what they are doing at least! These Hippie are kinda smart :) The concept is different than what you would normally expect (but the name of this place should shine some light and give an environmental foreshadow) and the food is \"far out, man!\" Being Mexican myself, it's got my approval.   The inside where you place your order gets crowded and is a small little area. The service is pretty good, they claim all the ingredients are \"organic\" and it does taste mighty yummy! Their fruit drinks are excellent too! The price is above average in comparison I think but bearable I guess.   ***The Bafroom: GOOD LUCK if you find yourself having the urge to use the restroom for anything! This is an outdoor eating environment and I didn't see any restrooms anywhere so no review on this. If you can correct me on this and lead me to my ultimate destination, please do and I will update this at a later date. In the meantime, better have some wet naps or Purell to sanitize your hands if you're a germ freak!",

I was  pleasantly surprised that Two Hippies Beach House Outrageous Tacos and Burritos caters to vegetarians, in its very modest selection of items.  The menu only has a handful of items, and that three items were vegetarian friendly was a plus.  I recently ate at this small restaurant and was able to enjoy a bean and cheese burrito.  The pinto beans were free from lard and the rice was free from chicken broth.  The vegetables were organic, which is also a plus.  Inside the burrito, were beans, cheese, rice, cabbage, tomatoes, and onions.  The burrito was quite good.  Salsa was also included on the side, but it was only okay.  Truth be told, the burrito was flavorful enough without the salsa.  The other vegetarian items available were a cheese crisp and bean and cheese tacos.  The prices were quite reasonable.  For two vegetarians, we were able to eat for $14, which included a fantastic slushy lemonade, coke, and side of rice.",

    "text": "Sorry, don't agree with most of ya yelpers on this place.   I wanted to stop by this place for awhile, so Sunday I took the trip down here to see what some of the fuss was all about. Cheap good food drew me in, and I'm a sucker for fish tacos. I drove up to this place thinking yes, this does look like a hippies house, with all the misc. crap placed all over the walls, ceilings and windows. I wouldn't say it had much of the beach vibe I think they were going for, or maybe it's just me, I have lived most of my life in San Diego and near the Beach, and most little beach shacks I've been to have a different vibe to them.   On the board it said something like famous fish taco's or something like that. I thought oh yes then, got to try those.. I really don't know why I insist to challenge my gut feeling of \"don't order the fish taco's, your in the middle of the freakin desert, there is no ocean for hundreds of miles\", but no.. I had to order them. Taco's were cheap, like $2 a piece.   The guy working at the counter that took our order was super friendly, he took the time to ask us how are day was going and what have we been up to and stuff. We waited about five minutes and our order was up. While waiting I was looking around at all the mess that was placed everywhere, and was wondering how this tied into there \"theme\".   And I wonder how long it's been since this place has gotten a good scrub, or at least a dusting???  OK, our order was up, and we sat in the back on some picnic benches. It was hot, but they did have a huge fan that made it bearable to sit back there. We opened up our fish taco's and noticed, wow these are huge! They piled all sorts of stuff in there.. cabbage, rice, ton's of cheese, fish, some sort of secret sauce, all on a flour, kinda thick shell (taste like the mission brand).   Grabbed the taco with both hands and bit into the taco. Blahhhh, it was the fish.. Oh man, the fish killed it.. taste so fishy and soggy it was gross. Next, don't ask me why I did it, but I thought I'd try it again. So I poured the red hot sauce they had given on it and tried it again.. Blahhhh, gross, gross, gross. The sauce didn't help at all. There sauce had no heat to it, and the fish was just as bad as the first bite. I had bought two taco's, and looked in back of me, and there were two guys in there 20's macking down on taco's, and I offered them our taco's we didn't eat. They said, no man.. where good. So I couldn't even give these away for free..   We drove off grossed out, and I had this fishy taste in my mouth for about 20 minutes before I had to stop and get something else to eat to get the taste out. Soda wasn't doing the trick. I remember saying to my husband in the car driving off, I don't feel good, I think I'm going to puke.. really my stomach hurt, and in no way do I have a sensitive stomach. Like others had said, I really did want to like this place, but no way I'll ever ever return. Sorry..",

My hopes were high; with a name like \"Two Hippies,\" I thought it would be a funky little place that served addictive street tacos... (I've never actually had *authentic* street tacos, but I KNOW they're not supposed to taste like THAT.)    My friend tried the three taco combo; one carne asada, one green chili, and one fish taco - all on the low end of mediocre (though she couldn't even stomach the fish taco).  My burrito tasted like they wrapped bland beans, rice-a-roni, boiled chicken breast, and one ton of chopped onions inside a Mission tortilla.  Don't get me started on the chips and salsa either... Mission and Pace for sure...  The horrible part about all this is that the service was REALLY wonderful!  I think it was one of the owners who served me, and it was probably one of the most pleasant experiences I've ever had service-wise.  She had a distinct Midwestern charm; unfortunately, that's also what the \"Mexican\" food at Two Hippies suffers (severely) from.    VERDICT: Go to Rosita's or Juan's instead...  (In response to Bryan L's callout:  1)  Yes, I'd take Bertos [or ROSITAS, or JUANS, or Chipotle] anyday over Two Hippies Beach House, and I'm not afraid to say it.  And 2) Everybody [staff and kitchen] speaks English at Two Hippies because they're white as ghosts.  It's like eating at a Chinese restaurant owned and run by Wisconsins.  When English is NOT the primary language of an ethnic restaurateur, to me that's a wonderful sign.)",

The only thing that could be better is the red salsa.  It has the consistency and appearance of ketchup and not much flavor.  The green is much much better.",

Between the old vdub out front and the sign for \"the best fish tacos in town\"  I was in.   And who doesn't love a good fish taco.    I ordered the one they are supposedly famous for there fried fish taco and a grilled fish taco.  To be honest I wasn't impressed with the fish taco it was good but the grilled shrimp taco was AMAZING   I would go back there again for the gilled shrimp taco I think they are the best I have had in the Phoenix area.  There prices were reasonable the tacos were about $3 each. And I got there just before the lunch rush at noon.  Service was quick and friendly.   I read somewhere that they had some health code violations and I did notice that the place needed to be cleaned a little more.  But for me good food at a good price with good service is worthy of five stars.",

Since coming to the OC I have been eating shrimp and shrimp tacos like it is going out of style, now I can see what all the fuss is about fish tacos, and I'm hooked! This is the first place I have found in AZ that has fish tacos (besides Del Taco, which obviously just can't compare) and they did not disappoint. The flavor was perfect, the price was right, and I drowned everything in a healthy dose of fresh squeezed lime. It was pure bliss!",

The cashier couldn't get our order right and we ended up paying for food we didn't ordered. Once the food arrived the young kid basically threw the food on our table obviously not caring about customer service. The food wasn't anything special. The red salsa tasted like tomato paste and ketchup. The \"famous\" fish tacos had no flavor nor any fish amongst all the batter. My husband ordered the red chili beef burrito and thought it was just ok. Nothing stood out it. On all accounts this \"little gem\" fell short on all accounts.",

Since this place is pretty close to where I live, we decided we wanted some quesadillas and burritos for lunch. One of the specials was a mango habanero grilled fish burrito, so we ordered one of those and a loaded quesadilla with red chile beef. The mango habanero grilled fish burrito was pretty good, but it isn't my favorite item I've gotten. I felt like there could have been a lot more flavor in the fish especially since mango habanero sounds so delicious. The burrito was not spicy at all and there wasn't much sweetness or mango flavor either. While the burrito wasn't what I expected, it was still tasty. The loaded quesadilla is one of my favorite things to order here. It is so flavorful and has a bit of a kick to it. The quesadilla is so filling and you definitely need to try it!!!",

Salsa on the side was excellent also! For the price and the quality you definitely cannot go wrong here. And the beach vibe takes you away even if for a brief 15 minutes and reminds you that you are at a beach hut food stand in SoCal which is a godsend on those days of triple digits that will be hitting us real soon!",

Today we finally decided to stop in and see what it was all about. The ordering process was my least favorite as there were several others waiting to put their orders in the small order area. I ordered a couple fried fish tacos and a carne taco and my fiancee ordered the rice bowl with chicken. We found a place to sit, after a little bit of water clean up from the patio misters and a few minutes later we had our food brought out. I have to say that I'm really impressed with what we got for 17 bucks. The fried fish were very large pieces and very tasty, carne was good and the rice bowl was really nice.   We will definitely be back, albeit maybe a cooler time of the year, and with a few beers in tow because you know, BYOB IS AWESOME.",

Everything is good from the selection of soft drinks to the simple but perfect street tacos and burritos to the sauces. Ordering is walk up to a small counter in a confined space that tends to create a certain 'la convivialite' among your fellow diners. There is indoor and outdoor seating among hanging plants and old Volkswagen doors and such. It's BYOB limiting customers 24oz each (we brought a six pack and left 2 in the car but ended up drinking those too). The best shrimp tacos I have found! I get the mango hot sauce on them.

    "text": "Nice joint! (No pun intended, okay maybe a little bit). This place reminds me of back home in California, it could be a place right off of Mission Beach or Hermosa Beach.  They don't have any indoor seating so keep that in mind during the warmer months. They have a 1/2 wrap around patio with misters and on the other side there are picnic tables with umbrellas.   Okay let's get to the best part, the food. I've tried so many things here that I'm just going to break it up into levels:  GREAT 5/5: Passionfruit Guava Slushie, the Nachos (with grilled chicken), Chipotle Shrimp Taco, and the Chipotle Shrimp Burrito.  GOOD 4/5: Passionfruit Mango Slushie, Loaded Quesadilla, the Fried Fish Taco, Peach Guava Slushie, and the Mango Habanero Taco.  OK 3/5: Guava Mango Slushie, the Spicy Chili Shrimp Taco, the Sweet Chili Shrimp Taco, Spicy Chili Beef Taco, Carne Asada Taco, Green Chili Beef Taco, and the Pomegranate Slushie.  Service is always great, they are helpful and patient when you're ordering and your food comes out relatively quick. Out of the many times I've been here service was only slow once.  The only negative are the close quarters specifically where you order, and the bathroom. I know they're trying to emulate a certain flair but they're still in Phoenix, they should treat themselves to the best of both worlds. Hopefully they'll open it up in the future because it was rather uncomfortable being in such close quarters with so many people, like being on an airplane and waiting for the bathroom. Otherwise, great place!",

Not so good: As my wife and I were walking into the restaurant a shirtless gentleman seated at an outdoor table began making unwanted comments about my wife. This continued while we were ordering at the counter and made the wait for our food uncomfortably long. This is not a complaint with the restaurant itself, as the restaurant staff were excellent and seemed to be as annoyed as we were.  But, unfortunately it put a damper on our visit. The shirtless gentleman made comments to the staff indicating he was a regular of the restaurant, thus making me less inclined to return and why I wanted to mention it. Bottom line: I really enjoyed the food, excellent tacos and phenomenal shrimp burrito, and a strange experience with a fellow customer to be wary of.",

I know Phoenix has some many great choices for tacos that it can be overwhelming....LOOK NO FURTHER.  You will not be disappointed.  I have have some great tacos but let me just say that Two Hippies have THE BEST fish & shrimp tacos I've had. The icing on the cake is the great prices.  I still don't understand why other place (most of them) charge so much for a taco.    I recently took some out of town guest and they fell in love with this place.    A few tips: This place is always busy but the line moves pretty fast.  Not the best services but the food is worth it. Take a look at the pics from other reviews and you can see this is a cute \"little\" spot, nothing fancy.   ENJOY!!! My mouth is watering writing this review",

My fave though?  The grilled fish! Literally, you have got to try them!  We ordered some chips and salsa too and, clearly, their chips are homemade.  Also some of the best I've ever had.  Super friendly service, too! If you're a GCU student, they offer a discount so don't forget to show your I.D.! The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because there is no indoor seating option and in Phoenix that can be a problem...especially from late May thru late September.",

All you need to know is that their fish tacos are delicious and what makes it better are their slushies.

If you live here then take advantage of it. If you're visiting and are in the area you NEED TO TRY this place. They have tacos, burriotos, rice bowls, nachos, and quesadillas. They have different meat options AND vegetarian options!",

I personally work 40 hours a week in customer service and during that time I'm not allowed to be on my phone due to I'm on the clock. Today as I waited in line I was FaceTiming my friend I haven't seen in weeks catching up with her. The cashier was clearly offended because when I went to tell my friend \"one moment I'm going to order my food\" he instantly went on his phone didn't greet me didn't say hello, I gave him a few seconds to look at whatever he needed but he was clearly offended, acting as though i was wasting his time..... that he was being pair for. I just blurted my order out which seemed to catch his attention.   The to easy up the tension I noticed he was wearing a sea foam green holster shirt, I asked him if he was wearing holster in which he responded \"yeah is that a problem?\" With the biggest attitude.   Ive been to this location many times and have never received that kind of service. You can't be offended when a customer is on the phone, we all work 80% of our lives away and in that spare 20% if i want to catch up with a friend while waiting IN LINE , I'm obligated to, YOU'RE being paid to be there I'm not.    Tacos are too good to stay away from",

I got a fish taco, and a carne asada taco.  The fish taco was really fishy, and was like the bottom greyish parts of the fish near the tail sorta thing, and the carne asada I just didn't enjoy the seasoning.  I love cabbage in a taco, but not when it's real big and chunky i like it a fine mince.   If you want to eat a good burrito/taco go to the taco stand in front of charlie's (gay cowboy bar at 7th Ave and Camelback).",

All of them wrapped in a warm panini grilled style flour tortilla (corn if you want) and stuffed with fresh meat and organic vegies.   Accompanying them was some salsa verde and regular red salsa, both were super flavorful and I assume home made.  3 tacos was too much for me but I devoured them all.  The pork aka carnitas was my favorite.  Next time I plan to try out their burritos or quesadillas.  This is place is excellent and affordable.  The scenery is cool, reminds me of a place I used to eat at in Ocean Beach when I lived in San Diego.  It's a must try!!!!!  Nice work Two Hippies...you've got something good going!",

The prices are cheap so I guess that you get what you pay for; however, I could get a much better tasting burrito at Chipotle or a local Filiberto's type of restaurant for the same price.

I look forward to having other food there and I'll let you know. I finally had to have one of the brownies (I usually eat at magic mushroom burger). It was interesting. It was soft, but the chocolate chips were sort of crunchy.  That may not sound too good, but it was a unique take on brownies and didn't make me like it any more or less. Of course, there were jokes about, \"Don't tell anyone where you got them\", and that was almost the sole reason I wanted one. My friend and I shared it and we had some left over.",

    "text": "I couldn't have been more disappointed with my first venture into a Two Hippies.  My husband and I rushed home to see who could hammer this place on Yelp first (he beat me).  I ordered a hot dog because I love hotdogs.  This one was large and cheap, but the flavor was mostly salt, and it looks boiled, which did nothing to improve it.  The bun was excruciatingly hot, and as soon as it cooled enough to eat, was excruciatingly tough and chewy (either overly steamed or overly microwaved).  Hot dog alone would have earned 2 stars, but unfortunately I tried to share the hubby's tacos...  eeeewww, the fish mush tacos were downright nasty.  Seriously, they were not just lacking good qualities, they had a mushy texture and bad taste.  The pork in the pork tacos was fatty, chewy, and overly marinated.  The green beef was tolerable, but nowhere near pleasant.  Overall a bad food experience and I came home hungry enough to pig out on Christmas cookies.  Atmosphere is fine, place is clean, service quick and pleasant - but that does not make up for the food.",

I have people for that. First off I must say for bong sake you have the longest restaurant name evah! Secondly I must say your pork tacos really hit the spot. Granted one side of the tortilla becomes a bit slimy by the time it reaches me (from my people) and the foil is unwrapped (again, my people) and I finally plunge that delicious hippie taco into my boca. The pork is moist (ewww, i don't usually say moist...OMG...I said it twice) and a little crunchy in parts. Perfection. Seasoned with love. Like a good hippie. A few beans, cabbage, cheese and tomatoes thrown in and I'm happier than a hippie at a Patchouli sale. Or happier than a hippie in a muraled van selling incense and bongs on Venice Beach. Or happier than....oh...you get the idea. All this love for under $2 a taco. Now I know why you are Outgrageous! I may tye dye a t shirt, get out the Nag Champa and pop in Dazed and Confused. Now. Damnit. Where is that bag of Doritos?",

It's chock-full of knickknacks, posters, and snarky signage that will keep you occupied while waiting for your order. I wasn't even bothered by the lingering smell of lavender incense, plenty of which to select from. I purchased opium and cherry. Nope, never gonna burn em; impulse buy. The side patio is a great spot to sit and munch on 2 dollar tacos while being windblown by industrial coolers and misting systems. I love it. Tonight's attraction, Poetry Slam, and man this was one slam jam. Note to self, take up ripping people to shreds by way of organized angry verbal release. Possible new found therapy.

Almost every time I've gone it's such a hassle finding a parking spot since their parking lot only holds around 8 spots. The first time I came here I got the chicken burrito and it was okay. Nothing that special but it was a decent burrito. However, the second time I came I got the shrimp burrito and wow that made me look at this place in a whole new way. The shrimp is grilled fresh to order and that paired with the chipotle mayo inside the burrito is amazing. The last time I went I asked for an extra side of chipotle mayo because it's that freakin good. The biggest downfall for me is their salsas. When I think of good Mexican food a necessity is a good quality salsa and unfortunately I have not found that here. Their red salsa is too watery and bland and their green salsa has absolutely no spice at all. I think a nice smoky, spicy salsa would go perfect on the shrimp burrito but since they don't have a good salsa, I stick to the chipotle mayo. Cool ambiance too. All outdoor seating which might not be as fun in the summer but when the weather is nice it's a great spot to grab lunch and chill outside.",

    "text": "So we picked up the college kid to grab a bite and picked this for dinner. We arrived at 645pm. It was a wait to order and pay but about 15 minutes after we got there it was incredibly longer to wait. The food was good. We ordered 3 chicken tacos, a quesadilla, a carne asada burrito, 2 shrimp tacos, a Coke, a root beer, one blue raspberry slush lemonade, and a mango slush lemonade. The cost was $31.58. The slushes are free refills but the line was so long that it was an improbable idea. The food was tasty and good portion of freshness.  The location was funky beach house. Super cute. The bathroom was a little sketch but it was clean so that's all that matters.  All in all, a good random choice off Yelp!",

    "text": "I came in to pick up a quick bite while doing errands. I ordered three different tacos to give each one a try (mostly because I'm super indecisive). My boyfriend ordered a burrito and we got another simple burrito for a friend. We also tried each of their heat leveled salsas.   Pros: the restaurant has plenty of seating. You order inside and can have a seat on any of the three outside patios, each being blissfully misted to the perfect degree. Staff was very friendly and even accommodated us ordering something not on the menu for a reasonable price. The setting is very laid back and friendly. Though I'd didn't try them they offer many vegan and vegetarian options that actually sound delish. The red chili beef with the house green sauce was pretty tasty.  Cons: the carne asada has almost no flavor, the volcano sauce packed spices and thickness but not a great taste and both the green and volcano had a slightly jello like constancy. I assume they have to be kept really cold and that's what the cause was because once the green had sat for a bit it was at least quite tasty. The green chili beef also didn't have much taste. They used ordinary shredded cheese  on the tacos and didn't melt at all so it added to the blandness.   Overall: I'll definitely come back and try a few other things on their menu, I would definitely suggest to it to anyone looking for a quick bite or someone who's not a huge fan of Mexican food but wants to try something new.",

Went in the little shack and ordered the green Chile beef nachos & the loaded chicken quesadilla. Food came out quick and boy was it delicious. There was generous amounts of the toppings on both items. In the cooler/fridge they have multiple sauces you can use. The green was our favorite. The people working were super friendly and busy! Ample seating on their multiple patios. Also great prices - $14 for what we ordered.",

It's crazy but even the tortilla was grilled perfectly. Chicken was very tasty.   My husband ordered the grilled fish tacos and agreed, best he had ever eaten.   Its very small but we found a place to sit rather quickly and even though we waited in line for about 8 minutes (it was busy) the food came out very fast. The guys cooking were shouting out orders as the woman behind the register was taking my order. They have a great system .... not one item during what seemed to be a bit chaotic of a kitchen came out wrong. They just nailed it.   We will be back.",

    "text": "This has got to be the best taco shop (haven't tried the burritos yet but they looked amazing too) in the Camelback corridor and for that matter maybe all of downtown Phoenix. Why? Well, let's start with the one negative - Parking. Since this place is right off of Camelback and 7th Ave it's super hard to get a spot with so few areas to park in,  it if you get lucky like we did today and got a front row spot then your in for a great.  Now - on to the good stuff:  The Ambiance: Super low key California beachy vibe with lots of cool old 50's memorabilia (such as an old speed queen washer) and lots of cool signs adorn the inside and outside of the little shack. There are a few seats out front to eat and 2 side areas with picnic tables adorned with all kinds of 60's happy faces and peace signs\" from November til April it's a joy to sit outside in the weather because the AZ weather is awesome for a primarily outdoor place.  The Food: Street Tacos in Carne Asada, chicken, shrimp & fish (tilapia) are super tasty with limes, cabbage, beans and cheese as toppings with a chipotle sauce and some salsa to boot.....the burritos looked huge and tasty as well but we only sampled the chicken and grilled fish today.   Best Part: PRICE!!!! 1 taco for $3 (ok maybe a bit pricey for a street taco, but wait it gets better - 2 tacos for $5 and 3 tacos for only $6....this has got to be the best value around cuz this is no Taco Bell! They also have cokes in. Titles from Mexico with the real sugar and some other tasty drinks to partake.  Uber Friendly and a must go for a great meal and a great Value....Definitely a MUST DO place in PHx!",

    "text": "Just being near this place reminds me of more places that I can count. I practically grew up living near the beach in Southern California before it got chic and places like this were where the locals got awesome food dirt cheap.  This is the kind of place we would hang out way south of San Felipe past where the Carretera Puertecitos turns inland, usually making fast friends with real hippies with a beer in one hand and a whatever they had in the other.  But to run across a place like this along the upscale Camelback corridor tucked between car dealers and Phoenix's old neighborhoods?  And to walk in and see that it's not some trendy corporate \"theme\" restaurant?  Oh wow!  These guys nailed the beach shack look and feel, I pretty much ran out of words to describe it because it's more than just a building where you can get food.  I seriously forgot for a few minutes where I was and could almost hear surf and seagulls.  We got there after 1 PM on a Friday afternoon and there was a short but friendly and mellow line out the door.  Things move fairly fast but I never felt rushed.  Owning a restaurant and being able to do that magic must be some sort of art.  Things got busier very quickly when the nearby private prep school recessed and all of a sudden the line got a lot longer with a lot of young guys who would decidedly never be called hippies.  It was an interesting melding that may not work everywhere but somehow this shack is one place anyone and everyone can feel comfortable.  And IMHO the staff has a lot to do with that all happening.  The menu isn't very diverse, it's tacos and burritos and a couple of other things.  What you put in them is subject to what they have available at the moment but there's something for every taste.  And even with long lines the wait time until they bring you your food is just a few minutes.  The also list some specials on the board, I had a Chipotle Shrimp Burrito which was made with marinated grilled shrimp, beans, rice, cabbage, pico de gallo, feta cheese and chipotle mayo.  It was huge and far exceeded my expectations.  Between the two of us we had more food than we could eat and still paid less than twenty bucks total.  Now that you've read my review I suggest you check this place out.  The best times are probably not when the Brophy boys get out of school, there's 1200 of them and I think this is one of their favorite places.",

I ordered 1 each, shrimp and a grilled and fried fish tacos. I love to eat food which you dont have to add anything to eat. He offered green, red and volcano salsa, but select green based on his recommendation. I only used it on the fried fish more or less because I just wanted to taste it. Of the three I liked the shrimp the most. I feel they must marinate the shrimp in a lime concoction. Service was great but it was a bit chilly so I requested mine to go. It was busy, so clearly it's quite popular.",

Right away when I walked in I was greeted with big smiles and hellos, and then the cashier helped walk me through the menu, guided me on popular menu options and made recommendations on what to get. I'd say the fried fish and shrimp tacos are an absolute must-try, but I wasn't as impressed by the grilled fish. Also splurged for the teriyaki shrimp burrito as an extra flavor to try and it was fantastic. However, because it's a hole in the wall place, it only has outside seating so plan on taking out if you visit in the dead of summer. Also, probably because of the location, the clientele was questionable on my visit but it's hard to hold that against the restaurant itself. All in all, I can't wait to return.",

Took me 5 minutes to get my fish burrito (Thanks to Chris T for the recommendation!) It was HUGE and came with a little cup of two salsas: green and red.  I cut it in half to enjoy the salsas separately.   Filled to the brim with rice, cheese, beans and the fish and smothered in some sort of sauce, it was delicious!   Service was super-friendly and everyone had a smile on their face and said \"Amy, your fish burrito is ready!\"  I mean, the personalized service was great.  Maybe hitting them at a slow hour was what did it.  There is a little retail spot where you can get incense (they're hippies, get it???) and posters on the wall to peruse while waiting.  I took mine home, but the patio is lovely.  There's even a vintage bike parked out front with little baskets filled with potted plants.  How adorable is that????",

I should have known there would be a problem when I asked the girl at the counter if the chicken in the tacos was pollo asado and she looked at me like I was not from earth.  Okay, is it shredded chicken?  Um...it's marinated chicken.  Okay, bypassing the marinated chicken tacos, I order two carne asada and one fish taco.    The girl hands me a bag and I think it's someone else's order because it looks like three huge burritos in there. But it's mine. I open my first \"carne asada\" taco and it's just this sad excuse of a taco...horrible white flour tortilla, some bagged shredded cheese, 5 pinto beans and meat that in no way tastes like carne asada.  It's fatty and lacks flavor.  Gross.  I move on to the fish taco, hey, they're famous for them.  I take one bite and push it aside. I take a couple more bites because it's covered in a tasty sauce that tries to hide the nasty fishy flavor.  I stop myself. Rubios does fish tacos better than this.  My husband had the \"pollo asado\" sandwich which I would give three stars but wouldn't go back for.  Next time we're looking for tacos or carne asada, we'll stick with America's Best Taco shop, thank you very much.  And next time we eat at a Two Hippies concept, we'll go back to their burger joint.",

    "text": "I've been handing out a lot of poor reviews lately, and I hate to be so negative, but this one really deserves it. Sure, there are plusses and minuses, but some of the important aspects were all minuses.  I went in for dinner at about 6:30 and there wasn't a lot going on so I went in and ordered a red, green, and carne asada taco with a \"lemonade.\" The girl behind the counter was boasting about their fresh squeezed \"lemonade\" and I like when it isn't canned mix so I ordered it. I went outside and got a seat on the counter looking into the building and after about 10 minutes they brought out my food. I was actually kind of amazed it took that long to make 3 tacos, but whatever, that was fine.   The first taco, the red, was ok. Perhaps it was the fact that it was overloaded with beans, cabbage, and other mixtures of everything that usually is on your plate at a mexican restaurant, but I thought it didn't really have a flavor. The green was much of the same, no real flavor, but not a bad experience. They were both just \"meh.\" Maybe now would be a good time to comment on that \"lemonade.\" IT TASTED LIKE A FUCKING SLURPEE FROM 7-11. You have got to be kidding me if you are going to tell me this is a fresh squeezed lemonade. For ***** sake you even told put slurpee ice in it. I'm not buying it whatsoever, that this has ANY real lemon content. Ok, so now that final taco, the carne asada. I had high hopes since the other two were so bland I thought maybe it'd be harder to mess up carne asada, but I was wrong. It had absolutely no flavor, and had a horrid texture I don't know if the meat was overcooked or what but it tasted like a taco with beans and cardboard. I had to douse it in lime and hot sauce to make it edible, and still bearly was so, partly because the hot sauce they provide is not so tasty either.   I didn't look for a restroom, but I imagine they have one, as they would never be allowed to build the restaurant without at least one public restroom. The entire concept of the restaurant is very cool, and I can see it being a good lunch spot during the winter months, if, and this is a big if.... they can get their food to taste like something delicious. And actually make lemonade. Guys, who are you trying to kid?",

The other Two Hippies on 7th Ave in Melrose Plaza left such a bad taste that I couldn't bring myself to try this one. But eventually my longing to be on a beach in Mexico tempered with a bad economy drove me to try. It was good. Quite fun ambiance. I was glad I didn't go during a peak time because where you order is claustrophobic. But 3 tacos for $5 filled to the brim AND vegetarian options made it worth it. The biggest surprise was the free refill on the yummy fruit lemonades. $16 for 6 tacos, two lemonades (and refill), chips and salsa was a scream. As hungry as I was I couldn't finish all 3 tacos. Good stuff. The boys working were delightful!",

The tacos have a unique mix of cabbage, onion, beans, (and more) that may not sound like they go with a taco, but when all put together they do.

My wife and I both remembered their burritos as quite enjoyable, with fresh tasty ingredients, sizable without being too much and properly assembled (which makes a big difference if you plan to not eat it with a fork and knife). Well this time, we were in for an awakening when we finally got our burritos (which took about 10 minutes for them to prepare on a not-so-busy afternoon). I ordered a simple bean and cheese burrito and my wife ordered the fish burrito. Both burritos were enormous, overstuffed and so poorly wrapped that after one bite, both our burritos fell apart revealing the inner contents to both be lukewarm with unmelted cheese and rather tasteless beans, rice, tons of cabbage and average at best tasting fish. In order to eat our meals, we had do scoop out at least half the contents in order to properly fold the bland tasting tortillas holding this mess together. Neither of us could fathom why Two Hippies hires cooks apparently residing in southern Arizona who don't seem to have a clue as to how a burrito is supposed to be wrapped so I suppose that is an achievement, The whole affair turned out to be a completely unsatisfying sloppy mess, and not one we are likely to repeat at any time soon.  It should be stated in fairness that the counterperson who took our order was enthusiastic and friendly. And the specialty lemonade drinks were good.",

    "text": "I have been hearing about the Two Hippies brand for awhile now, but was never near one around a meal time.  Now that my office is closer, I decided to try out the Mexican concept, because I love me some Mexican food!  I was a bit overwhelmed when ordering, it is not that they have a large menu by any means, but it is up on a chalkboard above the register, and I felt the pressure to order quickly.  It was not until after I ordered that I realized that they only took cash, and my wallet was filled with plastic!  I told the guy I would go run to the bank, but he pointed to the ATM machine in the corner, so I felt obligated to go ahead and pay the fee to get my $5 burrito.  I ordered the green chile beef, because I have been obsessed with that lately, and it also said that the burrito was served with rice, beans, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes.  Before I could make my way around to the pick-up window my order was ready.  I took my burrito back to my office and took a bite...it was good, but it was the green chile beef that I was expecting.  It was just shredded beef that had been seasoned with green chiles, it was good, but really just tasted like shredded beef.  The main issue I had with my burrito, other than it being the size of my head, was that it wasn't very hot.  I could tell that they attempted to warm up the tortilla, but didn't give it enough time to fully heat through, making the tortilla a bit stiff and hard to keep wrapped around the filling.  Another tell tale sign that it wasn't very hot?  None of the cheese even thought about beginning to melt!  I like it when the cheese starts to melt and blends in with all the other flavors, but nope, this cheese stayed in its purest unmelted form.  I might give this place a try again, while I wasn't blown away, the price is right and I see that there could be hidden potential.",

    "text": "it looked really interesting when i saw it, and the place we decided to go eat on a sunday was closed, so we went to try Beach house because it was right down the road.   Upon getting there the place is really confusing, so after walking around it, we found the place to order, on the West side of the building.  I got their chipotle pork burro special. It was huge but the majority of it was veggies and rice, i felt jacked. there was a real chipotle chili inside the burro so that was really cool  the peach lemonade was delicious with lemon twists in it at as well. I'd come back but it isn't the best of mexican food i've had.",

Can't speak for the chicken or beef, but have been with friends who enjoyed that stuff too.  The veggies are fresh and organic!!!  The beans are whole pinto, not lardy refried.   All tacos are $1.50! Big burritos are $4.  Tons of hot sauce in the back.  Drinks are a litle expensive, but it is hard to turn down a flavored lemonade with a fancy umbrella.  The owner is super cool.  Everytime I eat at this place, he makes sure to tell us that he appreciates our business.  I appreciate this buisiness myself,  I am always trying to find excuses to go out that way.  Luckily I have one such excuse today!",

    "text": "I like what the Two Hippies brand is trying to do.  Bring a local chain of food at a great price point.  The problem is, they aren't killing it on the product.   If you want to have a dumpy location, with nowhere to sit, and a decent concept, the food better be damn good.  There is no place to sit inside, so I am not sure how this place will make it through the winter.  The food is ok.  Its not terrible, but it doesn't even compare to another mid-town taco shop (America's).  I'm not going to argue if I am taken here, but I will definitely suggest America's over this establishment in a heart beat, even though Two Hippies is closer to both work and home.",

We looked at the menu and decided to get the 3 tacos for $5.00 and a bottle of water for $6.00 total.  Menu prices include tax and they accept cash only.  I had 2 chicken tacos while my wife tried a fish taco.  Included on each taco is:  Beans, cheese, tomatoes, onions, shredded cabbage, rice, a choice of meat, which green sauce and red salsa on the side.    These aren't tiny taco bell tacos.  These things are huge and delicious!  My wife loved her fish taco and the chicken tacos were also fantastic.  We can't wait to go back.    My only wish was that I had black beans on my tacos instead of pinto beans, but my wife looked at their menu online later and found that I could have requested them.  A minor error I shall correct on our next visit.",

I ordered the Carne Asada, Pork and Fish tacos.  I could only eat two at that time.  I tried the pork and the fish.  Both very good!  The carne asada (several hours later) was also very good, and probably would have been great had it been fresh and warm.  No frills, limited seating.  The owner (??) Andy was super nice and chatty.  I've driven by at lunch, and seen the place packed.  Dinner last night was not the case.  Food still seemed fresh, though.  I will be back (wish they were open later, though)  Just had lunch here again today!  The fish tacos were actually better then I remember!  The pork was also very good, juicy and tender.  I was less impressed with the carne asada, though.  Still, a good experience, and still highly recommended.  They would get 5 stars if they had alcohol and were open later...",

I found myself really hungry after work, and, feeling bored of the usual haunts, decided to finally give Two Hippies a try.   I got a heavy brown paper sack full of bulging fish tacos, and a side of chips and salsa. The fish tacos were juicy and very tasty - solidly good, yet nothing that blasted-me-out-of-the-water good. I think the value is what is most noticeable: $5 gets you three tacos with stuffings of your choice. I was very happy, and think that even Rubio's could go toe-to-toe (I may even prefer Rubio's fish tacos to Two Hippies).   Check it out, and you'll get a tasty meal for dirt cheap. The success of Two Hippies is evident by their recent boon: I think they're opening two more places (pizza and a breakfast joint), to add to their local empire. I'm interested to check them out, and hope they are as good at the tacos at their surf shack on Camelback.",

    "text": "I finally wound up at Two Hippies for tacos the other day after living within a stone's  throw for a few months. Whenever I go to a place for tacos, I'm expecting one of two things... either mass quantities of grub on the cheap or in-your-face quality and flavor. Two Hippies Beach House takes care of the former. The service was friendly, and the chow is okay, not bad, but not outstanding in the slightest. It's truly perfect as a quick and filling meal that you can mow down with a few friends before going out to the bar or for when you are getting back from the bar. And that, to me, has it's own special place in the restaurant food chain. For $5 flat I can walk away with three giant tacos loaded with plenty of ruffage to extinguish my appetite. Throw in some green salsa with those tacos and I'm content. There's no doubt that I'll be back soon enough.",

They don't have anything but mild.  Uh, hello - if you serve Tacos, you should have hot sauce available.  Then tonight I went back, ordered the same thing and there was absolutely no consistency.  Where they usually had cabbage and onions on that same taco, now they had lettuce and tomatoes.  And when I asked for a diet coke, oh we're out.  Oh and they don't take anything but cash.  I see where Tony K said Brandon takes the time to make sure his tacos are made correctly...I experience the exact opposite.  I've had a few good tacos here - last summer...and I guess I keep hoping I can get those tacos again.  But it sucks and I won't go back so don't worry about stocking or making hot sauce.",

I've been here at least 15 times and haven't been disappointed, although some of the options are better then the others.  The pork  tacos have recently passed into the sublime category, the beefs are decent.  The chicken is a decent, healthy option.  Carne Asada is meh, and the fish taco is not nearly close to good ones that I have had.  With that said they include organic cabbage and tomatoes which is a huge plus in my book.  Their flavored lemonades range from fantastic to meh.  The best part is 3 huge tacos are $4.50.  While they may not be authentic, the healthy (non greasy, organic vegatables), cheap price, and super friendly owner make this place a once a week type spot.",

Alright, that's not very fair to Phoenix, I'm sure there is plenty to do in the wee hours of the night if you know where to look and I don't. Fortunately I noticed Two Hippies Beach House yesterday night and remembered it tonight when I wanted some good food, fast and cheap and fun. The prices are a solid value, four tacos, chips and salsa, mango lemonade and a bottled water, all for under $14. Plenty of food for two and very filling. Unfortunately they take cash only. Fortunately they have an ATM with a very reasonable dollar fifty service charge right in the building.  Decor and atmosphere is fun and laid back. Outdoor seating is varied and if you can't find a comfy spot to sit and enjoy your food you are way to demanding. Four tacos, one Green Beef, one Cactus, one Chicken, and one Carne Asada, were all very tasty. I opted out of the cabbage they use in leu of lettuce (crispness factor) out of consideration for my somewhat picky tummy. The Carne Asada had some gristly and fatty pieces and was overly peppery but still palatable. The green salsa could use a bit more kick. And the chips were fine, nothing to write home about. Had a chance to speak with the owner since we closed the place down. Mo is a terrific guy who is more than happy to answer questions about his suppliers and general business philosophy as well as his life, family, hobbies and interests. We very much enjoyed talking with him and will check out the other restaurants in the group.",

I don't know what I am going to do when I am away at college, might have to order some very expensive Postmates hehe",

In fact I haven't even had a better fish sandwich then the fish tacos that I've had here, in fact I haven't even had better fried fish dinner to fried fish tacos that I had here! Not only was the staff helpful and friendly but the prices were beyond reasonable! It's not expensive at all. If you're reading this review and you aren't in the Two hippies parking lot you're all the way wrong! The set is cool and it's not in a location that's hard to find or hard to leave from when you're done eating. Are you still reading this review? If so you better be waiting for your two fish tacos you just ordered from two hippies! I just found my new favorite taco joint. I rock with Two Hippies all day!",

Great Service, most of the workers are really big on being morning people, opens at 11 AM and a great way to start your day.   Fried, Grilled, Cooked... any way that you would like your taco! I love this places taco's and they are very close to where I work!   Very large taco's and Only $6 for 3 tacos!  Check out Two Hippies!!! I would like to try other menu items but I cant seem to find the discipline to go here and not order tacos.  If you do stop by, please swing by and say Hi to us over here at Chapman BMW on 12th St. and Camelback right next the Cadillac store!   What a better day than getting a something that is new to you and a few of Arizona's best tacos!  See you around Soon!  -Phoenix Beemer Guy",

They have all sorts of vintage signs and trinkets and fun every day stuff decorating their little corner of paradise.  Once you walk through the outdoor seating area to the interior to order, you're greeted warmly by an easy to understand menu and friendly faces to answer any questions you have. By the time you have a chance to sit down and get situated, your food is done.  Get ready because the meats are so good and the guac is fresh and the salsa is delicious. On this first visit I had loaded nachos, tacos and a burrito (shared them...I'm not a total fatty!). Everything was AMAZING! Add 2 drinks and some money in their \"Karma Jar\" (tips) and I still spent less than $20!   I've been looking for a cool, priced, tasty taco shop and I found it. I drive past this place twice a week for sports and will be stopping at least one of those times for dinner. Check this place out!",

I asked about the size of the burrito since I was pretty hungry and they said about a pound.  I got it and no kidding, it was like a min football.  I got the spicy one and it was full of flavor.

I'm really big at eating/shopping at small and local business and restaurants cause that's where you always get the good stuff, but gotta tell yeah I was really disappointed when I came to this place. 16 bucks for 3 tacos that went in the trash and a torta along with a mediocre hot dog and drinks.

While not someplace I would bring the whole family this is a good place to stop for a quick bite or a snack.  This is not a sit down eating establishment , you go in place your order ( try the three taco combo)   and then wait outside. There are picnic tables , stools and pub stools around the outside to sit at. It was a clear beautiful day so very nice.   The hubby and  I   tried  pork, chicken and beef tacos which were all fresh and tasty.Tacos and  burritos were on fresh flour tortillas and had cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce and great spices. My husband also ordered a fish burrito which was ginormous  and he swore it  was over a pound . We also got cans of soda and ate all this for 11.00  not bad. No soda on tap.  I must mention that the owner( ?)  made us feel right at home and was super nice and even funny. His attitude was a big plus and made the eating more enjoyable. It was easy to see he enjoys his work .",

She'd make it with a can of Ortega diced green chilis, diced onions but this version adds cabbage and tomatoes. And all for $4. Love it. Before you go off on it, remember how much you're paying for this burro! Four bucks. You haven't had it this good since you had medium pizzas for \"regular price, four bucks, four bucks, four bucks.\"  I ordered the beans and rice on the side (they're normally served inside the burro), so I got to taste the sticky Spanish rice seasoned with chili powder on its own. The whole beans were pretty good too. Great as a side dish; so _glad_ I ordered them on the side. You can even take one of the bottles of habanero sauce to the table to impress and double dare your friends!  I have to agree with others' comments on the \"homemade\" lemonade. Like the beef burro It also took me straight back to my childhood, remembering sugary (think corn syrupy) Freezees at Circle-K. Definitely not fresh (except for the wedge of lime which was dry) but oh so memorable.  Don't forget the success of tiny Lenny's burgers at 15th Ave. Hippies pops at lunch being so close to the Brophy and Xavier campus. Great value, and location location location. I hope it's in the running for a permanent spot on the \"square\" (7th St to Ave, Camelback to McDowell).  Yea! Can't wait to try their special shrooms at the other location.",

The Red Beef was probably the best one, but still not that great...it had some bite and the beef was tender, but it still could have been seasoned better.  The cactus wasn't very good - it really wasn't seasoned and so it didn't have any flavor...at least the cactus wasn't overcooked.  The bean and cheese was probably my least favorite since it really didn't taste like anything.  I even tried one of their \"Magic Brownies\" (this one with cream cheese) and that wasn't very good either - it tasted like it had been wrapped in plastic and absorbed all those chemically plastic flavors...maybe it was older brownie?  All the tacos arrived wrapped and they look kind of awkward and wet (because of the steam) and definitely messy when you try to eat them.  Just overall, not very good...I'm sure there are a ton of places in Phoenix that have better, more flavorful food.",

They seem to be known for their fish tacos, but that's probably my least favorite thing on the menu.  The fish is peppered and not my taste.  However, the pork taco was terrific!  The kids had burritos with whole beans, great cabbage and tomatoes.  YUM.  And grape lemondade.  Sounds a little weird, but it was very refreshing and makes you feel like a kid again :-)  And with all the trippy decor, it's just part of the ride.    Next time I'll try the hot dogs.  Seriously - the guy behind us got a hot dog with feta and bacon!!  Again, sounds a little wacky, but I can't find anything wrong with bacon and feta, so how wrong could they be on a hot dog?",

    "text": "I was lucky enough to meet up here with Christina P for lunch yesterday.  The menu is currently the same as the other beach house with soft tacos, burritos and hot dogs.  They are are planning to add tamales to the regular menu and we got to try a sample of pork tamale and it was tasty.  I got the three tacos for $5 and a lemonade for $3.  There are several flavors of lemonade but I got the plain.  I got one each of fish, carne asada and chicken.  They were all tasty and I tried some of both the green and red sauces on them.  One thing I noticed is the meat didn't stand out on any of them and there was very little taste difference between the three.  All the ingredients were fresh and there was nothing soggy.  I thought the lemonade was good.  They have only been open a week and of course the place is spotless.  The two employees we dealt with were very pleasant.  I always carry cash which is a good thing because that is all they take.  There is an ATM in the lobby.  I haven't been to their other location but I am told it is much smaller. Inside there were 5 2tops and some stools with a couple of tables outside too.  The tables would seat 3 or 4 (cramped) so I think they should have a couple of additional chairs.  Overall I see it as a good neighborhood place to grab a quick bite to eat but certainly not a destination",

After accepting that disappointment we decided to check out Two Hippies due to their excellent ratings and only being a little distance from us. We pulled to the parking spot right in front, noticed several folks on the outdoor patio and in the kitchen, as we exited our car the person inside flipped the \"open\" sign around to closed and shut the window abruptly, at 4:18 in the afternoon. I understand if they were closed, but they blatantly closed in our faces with out any courtesy of speaking to us and explaining why they were closing mid day. That experience totally turned me off to ever wanting to go back, what a shame.",

    "text": "Now we stand at a crossroads; perhaps a dilemma. Is it truly Mexican when it's not made by Mexicans? Is a taco a taco just because someone said it is? Or a burrito? The philosophies and debates of Mexican food can go on for hours. But I like to think of it like this: If it tastes good, who cares?  This is the case with Two Hippies Beach House. Opened by the same Two Hippies, Andy and Jan Goldstein, who brought us Two Hippies Magic Mushroom Burger, they use words like tacos and burritos but never actually say they serve Mexican food.  What they do serve is an accessible, mostly delicious, well-priced menu. Really, any three tacos are $5, anytime!  If you've ever been to some of the surf shacks in San Diego, you'll notice it's like they picked one up and dropped it on the corner of Camelback Road and 5th Street a\" sans the sand of course.  In True Two Hippies fashion, every square inch of this small establishment is absolutely covered with kitsch of all kinds; such blissful tackiness. The front is about the size of a postage stamp, barely enough room to stand after ordering at the counter. Once your order is ready, they call out your name. You can take your stash home or go around back and pull up a picnic table.  While you wait, take in all the decorations, though if you have some condition of OCD, you might have a problem with the clutter and want to start arranging and organizing. I had to put my hands under my seat so as not to give in to my secret urges.  The emphasis on the menu is tacos, as well as the hot dogs and lemonades. Two Hippies also can make any of the taco flavors into a burrito like the Red Beef ($5). The burritos are massive. If I had to guess, IaTMd say they probably are close to a pound. They are loaded with tender red chile beef, rice and beans, and they fill you up big time.  The Cheese Crisp with Chicken ($4.50) is also huge and fully packed with tender chicken, onion, guacamole, tomato and cabbage. ItaTMs much lighter than the burrito but still very filling.  On another other visit I stuck with the tacos, ordering up the Taco 3 Pack ($5) and choosing fish, cactus and chicken. These tacos are massive, like all the food at Two Hippies. YouaTMll never leave hungry.  Interestingly, Two Hippies does not use corn tortillas, opting instead for the medium sized flour variety.  I'm always leery about ordering fish since we live hundreds of miles from the closest ocean, and on one visit my instincts were spot on. The fish was so strong I could only manage a few bites, even with the delicious red salsa it couldn't help that poor fish.  Although another visit revealed the fish to be spot on, flaky and mild, so the fish taco could be a crap shoot. The chicken taco was a chicken taco, good with a nice balance of veggies and meat. However my favorite was the cactus taco, tender sliced cactus topped with cabbage, onion, tomato, rice, beans and cilantro. The cactus had a delicate sweet flavor and with so many textures was a delight to chow.  Beach House also serves up several different topped all beef hot dogs. I had the pleasure of trying the No. 6 ($3.75), which is pretty much the kitchen sink model. A soft squishy bun covered with pinto beans, cheese, jalapeos, mustard, ketchup, mayo and guacamole. Whew, this is like the daddy of all hot dogs. I think this could have been even a plain dog and I would have loved it. I'm not sure where they get their hot dogs, but the meat in this one was just so tasty, the toppings only added to my pleasure.  There are eight other hot dogs that also piqued my interest like the No. 4 ($4) that has feta, pesto-mayo, bacon, tomato and onion and the No. 8 ($3.75), which is covered simply in guacamole. I had forgotten how much I enjoy a good hot dog, look out Costco!  With 16 base flavors, the lemonades ($3) are a great way to to complete your meal. They use shaved ice so it's almost like having a slushy a\" complete with a brain freeze if you don't take your time. You can also combine different flavors to come up with your own custom lemonade flavor. The fun part is trying your different creations. Cherry and raspberry were nice and tart, but one combo was even better, the strawberry and peach. For me this almost had a creaminess from the round flavor of the peaches, this could be my signature drink on any upcoming visits if there weren't so many other choices.  Two Hippies Beach House does a pretty good job of bringing the walk-up taco shack to Central Phoenix, and it certainly entices all sorts of people. So if you decide to check this place out and you see a big bear stuffing his face with a yummy hot dog or one of the cactus tacos, please feel free to say hi.",

    "text": "A wonderful local taco shop with a distinct hippy/geeky hybrid vibe! You will have no trouble finding this place, it really stands out on Camelback with its funky design - look for the VW bus and a beach-style patio; inside you will find comic books and a cool figurine of Spock. But onto more important things - food & service!  Service - can't complain. It's always the same two people, and the girl who takes orders is really friendly and cool. I don't normally use words like \"cool\" in reviews, but here it is apt. This place is trendy and hip, without being hipster and tacky. The staff just comes off as the type of people you would be friends with and hang out with. It's counter service, so you really can't ask for more than a friendly intelligent face behind the counter, and Two Hippies are super rad people!  The food: I've sampled the menu, having the burritos, nachos, tacos etc... They were all good, but there is really one item that keeps me coming back time after time: the fried fish taco. One of the best I have ever had in my life. That good.  For about $3 you get a huge piece of nice fried fish, and the toppings are perfectly balanced with the fish. The sauce is tasty - no tartar on this.  While I recommend trying anything on the menu (caveat - the nachos were really disappointing)... I feel that the fried fish taco is a MUST HAVE. They are highly addictive, and you will forget you are not in San Diego or Puerto Penasco..... If you want to go to a really fun place, with super cool staff, and the best fish taco you will have in Phoenix.... Two Hippies on Camelback is a treasure to be discovered!",

Their carne asada is a little bit different than what you would get at your typical run-down Mexican food restaurant- here it is so tender and packed with flavor (and I have never found a single piece of fat or mystery meat).

    "text": "I'm just visiting in Phoenix but had this place recommended to me by my cousin who lives here. I ordered the three tacos for $6 special and had two carne asada tacos and one fried fish taco. I wasn't a huge fan of the carne asada tacos, as they had beans and rice in them and I'm not used to that, but the fish taco more than made up for it. SO DELICIOUS! The carne asada tacos had good flavor, I was just unaccustomed to the way they were prepared. The green sauce is delicious as well.  The service was friendly and efficient, and they were very quick to prepare the food. It closed at 8 and we didn't end up actually finishing and leaving until about 10 min after they closed, but they were really chill about it. Overall, a great experience and great quality food!",

All tables are outside and in Phoenix, that means it can get hot quick.  In fact, the day we were there, the outdoor temperature was close to 120.   However  the food makes up for any heat discomfort.  The Two Hippies have a fresh menu with daily specials and what they make, they make well!  Highly recommend the spicy shrimp burrito although the fish tacos were wonderful (we did both fried and grilled).  On top of it all the staff was helpful, knowledgeable and friendly.  Peace in a burrito - Highly recommend!",

Today I ordered 1 fried fish taco and a pork rice bowl (chipotle mayo on the side)  The fish taco tasted even better than last week 4 1/2 stars  As far as the pork bowl, I didn't care for the pork at all, but let me tell you the flavor of those pinto beans were on point. The pinto beans get 5 stars  2/25 - YES 2 days in a row....fried fish tacos were delicious as always! I ordered a chicken loaded quesadilla and I should have known better. The chicken looks SUSPECT, but against my better judgement I ate it. I was sick as a dog. NEVER AGAIN!!! The quesadilla was soggy from the guacamole and chipotle being inside. Lesson learned I will stick to ordering the fried fish tacos and a meatless rice bowl!   3/10 - 2 fried fish tacos - always delicious 4 1/2 stars  Rice bowl without meat, I was a little disappointed the pinto beans didn't have the amazing flavor like the first time I had them. So....with that being said I'm just going to stick you the fried fish tacos!   The customer service is always  friendly and professional 5 stars",

I love all the memorabilia.  The staff was awesome.  Very friendly.  It was warm and sitting outside in the heat with not even a slight breeze made it a rough first time experience.    I don't know if their fridge was down, but we were served slightly cooled canned sodas out of a cooler and the salsa that came out of the little soda fridge on the counter was starting to turn. It kept exploding out of the mustard squirter container.    The food was on point.  The tacos and burgers were good, but we couldn't fully enjoy it because we were sitting there sweating.  If you don't sitting outside in the heat, you'll get the most out of your Two Hippies experience if you visit in the Phx winter (which I plan on doing next week).    All in all though, good food, chill atmosphere.  I'd definitely go back.  Just not when its hot. lol",

My psychotic food loving brain is trying to figure out how to get 300 shipped to Boston in a way that I could freeze them and then eat them every day. Haven't figured out a way to make that happen, but hit me up if you have some ideas ;)  I tried 6 different tacos during my trips: mango shrimp, green chili beef, fried fish, chicken, pork... and I somehow can't remember the last. All of them were AMAZING! Honestly couldn't choose one that I didn't like if I tried.  If you're in town and you don't go here, you're making the worst mistake of your life, I swear.",

They all talked about how they never got the ticket...probably the one they gave me...then after a bit longer they brought them...not to go. They seemed quite edgy that they \"had to rush my order\" and that it now had to be put to go. I was irritated by this time...no one had accepted responsibility yet...and never did...the dude prepping said \" jeez we lost the ticket\" just the good ole ...its not our fault we lost the ticket for the order you gave and paid for...to us...but its not our fault.

I tried the chicken and spicy shrimp tacos. They have a 2 for $5, 3 for $6 deal, but it doesn't include shrimp, but the shrimp was definitely worth it- each shrimp was $3.50. The tacos are well made and not skimpy. Definitely worth what you pay for. The only thing I would change is to have a crunchy taco shell option! You order your tacos at the front, give your name, and they bring out your tacos in about 10-15 minutes. Will definitely have to stop by again!",

The big smiley face and old school hippie van catches your eye when you first pull in, and you're further wowed by the awesome 70's inspired decoration with all the vintage and new license plates, and all the nostalgic posters like Bob Marley, The Doors, Cheech & Chong and much more, my kind of place!   Service is super fast each time I've come here! I've ordered the vegetarian burrito (add cactus!) and the fried fish tacos. Both items were bursting with flavors and so reasonably priced! I can always go for Mexican food, ALWAYS, and it makes it that much better when it's a hole-in-the-wall spot because the taste is way more authentic. Me being a part time vegan and part time pescatarian (fish), this satisfies me in which ever mood I'm in! They have other staple Mexican foods of course if you're not feeling like a taco or burrito type of person.  Customer service is great, I've gotten my order taken AND delivered by one of the owners both times I've been here, John (?) is so friendly and welcoming, it's hard to find that often nowadays! I definitely see this being my frequent go to spot when I need my Mexican fix (which could be almost everyday!)",

As soon as we pulled up, I noticed the funky decor. I LOVED it!! There was also a large outdoor seating area. You order inside (there was barely room for three of us to be inside at once), and then they brown bag your order and write your name on it.   Tacos are $3/ea. or 3 for $6. I opted for 3 tacos. I was expecting standard street tacos, but I got so much more. My carne asada tacos came with the standard onion and cilantro, but also had rice, beans, cheese, and cabbage. I wasn't a fan of the cabbage, but the tacos were delicious otherwise.  Canned sodas are $1.",

I just adored their 1960s-70s decor vibe- I mean, music posters/pin-ups on the ceiling?  LOL.  I just got a kick out of checking every angle of this gem that stood out among reserved architecture/businesses on this stretch of a street.  Anyhoo, I sampled the vegetarian (yay) taco with Sprite (out of a can poured into plastic cup with ice).  $4 for a filling late lunch while continually to savor the remaining remnants that tided over the entire outdoor-only eatery: old license plates, vintage signs, painting of a guitar on a picnic table, 2 Adirondack chairs, numerous desert plants, vintage washer, and a '60s front-half of a van (interior was torn out, of course) that looked in sharp shape.  So enchanting!  There were others taking pictures like I was, and I just had to giggle!  So, food/drink was enjoyable and the place was clean & orderly with an approachable feel like at the beach. I asked a sweet personable young gal working there whether the owner's from Los Angeles, because this place is also somewhat similar to the legendary Oki Dog hot dog stand of the '70s-'80s that was frequented by punk rockers & their followers (Darby Crash of the Germs, as a start).  And, she said that no, the boss was not from there.  Two Hippies must be an Oki Dog incarnate then.  BTW, the gal even asked me afterwards how my meal was (\"yum\") and was also happy to take a picture of me at the front with my camera. Next time I have out-of-town guests, you can bet I will take 'em to Two Hippies.  See you there.  Smiley Face like their signage :)",

The man at the counter was very nice and helpful.  I ordered nachos and asked him to order me his favorite taco.   Mt partner ordered a bean and cheese burrito with cabbage.    We sat outside and the weather was fantastic!   We had fun trivia cards on the table and there was plenty to look at to keep us occupied until our order came.  The burrito was very large and my nachos and taco were huge too.  Everything tasted pretty good.  More toward the middle than the great tho.  The raw onions in everything was the most offensive part.  Not sure if we just missed that on the menu or if they just put raw onions on everything.    Over all, the price was right, the ambiance was nice, the service was great and we had a goodtime.  Was the food amazing?  No, but it was decent.  We will definitely go back and try a few more things and remember to ask them to hold the onions.    We will be back ;)",

    "text": "On our way to Chino Bandido, we passed Two Hippies Beach House (photo: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/W537pidoTVQmn9x1GPpxgA?select=-KIBVG11wjL2YuGn5nsNaA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/W537...</a>). Ever fans of Two Hippies Magic Mushroom Burger, we screeched to a halt and piled on into the restaurant.   Why would a couple of California-born-and-raised kids like my boyfriend and I want something from a \"beach house\" in the middle of the Sonoran Desert? We had faith in Two Hippies. Plus it's Baja-style, in the middle of Sonora-style country. Let's do this!   The main entrees are tacos and hot dogs, with \"burros\" also being a dining option. Tacos run $3 apiece, but you can get three for $6. Filling options are: red beef, green beef, carne asada, chicken, fish, cactus, pork, black bean, or pinto bean.   Burros, which are actually pretty huge (we're talking original Green Burrito's Big Ed-sized), cost $6 and have the same filling options as tacos. Tacos and burros come with cabbage, onion, tomato, pinto beans, rice, and cheese. My boyfriend got a burro with green beef and could barely finish it.   Hot dogs go for $3-5, they're all numbered and come with a bag of chips (though that's not mentioned on the menu). Just a regular hot dog on a bun is $3, but I felt the biggest bang for my buck was #4 -- pesto mayo, onion, tomato, feta cheese, and bacon for $4. Other hot dogs come with beef chili, jalapeno, guacamole, pinto beans, and the usual assortment of condiments.   It was pretty good, especially at the price I paid for it. It's comparable to Pink's in Hollywood, actually (definitely better than the Knott's Berry Farm branch, I can tell you that right now).   Our grub: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/W537pidoTVQmn9x1GPpxgA?select=3a-7JBtNWFZA9paBD0cBdA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/W537...</a>  Just like Magic Mushroom, this Two Hippies restaurant sells flavored lemonade for $3 (there's a very long list of flavors taped to the counter). I'd previously tried Prickly Pear (Beach House calls it \"Desert Pear\") and LOVED it, but wanted to try something else. The nice guy taking our order then mentioned some combinations he and the other guys working there made up. I don't remember the names and combos of the others, but I got the one he called \"Yummy in Your Tummy,\" which was a tropical blend of banana, kiwi, and other fruits, and it was GREAT. It came with an orange wedge inside and a little umbrella poked into the lid.     My boyfriend got the cinnamon-flavored lemonade since it sounded so out there, and it was actually pretty good. I would have expected it might have gotten spicy to drink after a while, but he says it didn't.   Outside of lemonade, they've got Chai tea ($3) and cans of soda ($1). If you're not digging hots dogs, tacos, and burritos, the only other thing they got is a quesadilla ($3/cheese, $5/chicken with guac and sour cream).   There's only patio seating since the lobby in front of the counter is so tight (packed mostly with random objects in keeping with the ambiance). It was a nice breezy day and Queen's \"Fat Bottomed Girls\" came on the loud speaker.   Yeah, we definitely had a nice meal.",

Also, the \"Sonoran dog\" was less Sonora and more hippie haberdashery.  Both items, the fish taco and hot dog, were decent.  It was just their bastardization of these two original classics that got to me.  They were so far from the originals that they shouldn't have shared the same name.   The place is alright, the prices reasonable, and the ambiance relaxed.  A nice place to include in the lunch mix, given you work in the area.",

If you have your work badge on when you order, you get a free drink. Had I only ever had their hotdogs, this would be a 5 star review.  However the past two times I went, I had Mexican food. A week ago I ordered the chicken quesadilla and most recently I ordered the carne asada burro. The chicken was well cooked, tender and moist, but it had obviously been boiled in water. Just water. Nothing else. No seasonings. And there was so much chicken (normally not a complaint) that I couldn't taste the cheese. The last visit was just a mess all around. My friend ordered the chicken burro and a large side of guacamole. The order comes out as usual, in a paper bag. Within a few seconds, we found that during the 10 ft walk to bring it out to us, two of the salsa contairs had opened and spilled everywhere. So everything had a coating of salsa on it. What a mess. But again, nothing was seasoned!! Neither the chicken or carne asada had any flavor to it. The guacamole was just mashed up avocado. No salt or pepper even!  Big disappointment!

I recently had a jerk chicken and pineapple salsa taco that changed my life! It was a daily special but anything on this menu is sure to please, and the variety of salsas ( which truly are not even needed due to the perfect flavor combinations), the staff is friendly and goes out of their way to please !! You must try this spot....your stomach and taste buds are sure to do a victory dance!!",

The fish tacos are bomb, but I've also tried the grilled shrimp and carne asada tacos and all are fantastic. The staff is super friendly- I always go when this one girl is working and she's awesome and accommodating. Love the atmosphere and the ability to enjoy my eats outside. This has become my regular spot for sure! Absolutely recommend",

Grilled perfectly with delicious rice and beans covered in amazing sauce. If you're a fish taco fan you MUST try this place. The customer service you receive is exceptional and the dinning area is perfect. So in closing I give them 5 stars",

    "text": "In my last review I mentioned the taco plate was $5, it's actually $6 - either I got it wrong or they raised the price a dollar since January. I still recommend it as they are pretty loaded with fresh ingredients and really good tortillas. I usually get one carne, one chicken and one pork - but the chicken is my favourite as the chunks of meat are HUGE and cooked to perfection. It's sure to fill you up.  One note: avoid the frozen lemonade. I was expecting a generous sized fresh lemonade slushy with a lot of flavour (I ordered blueberry) but what I got was a 24oz paper cup with Minute Maid lemonade, too much ice and hardly any extra flavour. Definitely not worth $3.  Minus one star from my last review for the pricing. \"Outrageously\" yummy but also some things are outrageously priced. You'd think that accepting cash only and charging no tax would also keep the cost down.",

The fish was crispy and tender in the outside, the pool and beef were beautifully seasoned and the volcano salsa was spicy but flavorful. Hands down some of the best tacos I have ever had!",

    "text": "You and everyone else that I have given second chances to are very lucky, Two Hippies. Because there are no thirds in my book. As I like to say, two and you blew gots ter goo. So.  My first try of your wares was on a Friday night after Bikram's (I wanted to try this thing that fellow yogi, Donald S. calls \"retoxify\") and I was not impressed with what I ordered, but I did achieve retoxification. The fish tacos were \"fishy\" and their wasn't much flavor going for them or the rice. Now, class may have been harsh that night, but the second time around at Two Hippies was WAY better. I had the burrito this time, with black beans and the green beef. Ho' yeah! That hit the spot, and I was plenty full and happy, no sides needed. And mama got her suga fix with those delish Shirley Temples they have. It was so sweet I had to get a refill. Mmmph! Service was great both times, so no complaints about that!  I love the look and feel of Two Hippies. It is like TGIF on all sorts of hallucinogenic drugs. Last night, Rada and I were looking all about as we waited on our food. Somehow we started comparing the cacti in the planters to penis sizes of my *ahem* men. So if you are one of those men, and ever read this review, which I highly doubt you will, there has been a cactus categorized as the size of your member out there in those potters someplace...  But seriously, this place is so quirky! I look like I belong in here (picture to follow soon), I did grow up near the Haight-Ashbury, something probably rubbed off on me at some point, no? Have you ever seen how I dress when I'm not at an OYE? Distinctly Grunge-Bohemianish. And this is why I purposely don't let you see me outside of said events...",

    "text": "As a taco lover, I will try any taco place once. Unfortunately that's going to be my only visit here. The atmosphere is decent. It's all outdoor picnic table seating, which I don't mind unless it's crazy hot out. The cashier was less than helpful. We asked what the best tacos on the menu were, only to be told that  she didn't know it all tastes the same to her. Well, she was right. The Carne asada was dry and lacked any significant flavor. The green Chile was also lacking in the flavor department. My lady had a fish taco which she said was good. But the tacos had too little meat and too much lettuce. Overall, the place is neat, but the food needs an overhaul. I'll be skipping this place on my Taco Tuesday ventures.",

The feta is the only thing on them that sometimes makes me wince, but you can just ask for them without it. Be sure to stop here! This is a must see in Phoenix. Pro tip: bring cash. The tacos are cheap, but you must be in cash.",
