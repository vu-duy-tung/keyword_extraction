    "text": "I went here with one of my friends for a yelp event back in January and it was amazing. Well I went back to try their $16 lunch plates(as we had a certificate from the yelp event) and was a little less than impressed. Let  me start with saying the service from our waiter Sergio was amazing, he did a great job with everything and was very nice he was also courteous to ask us if we had any time constraints for our meal so that he could acccomodate. Now let me start on the food. I ordered the clam chowder followed by the Mini tenderloin sliders with green beans. The clam chowder was mediocre nothing to write home about, the sirloin sliders were ok. While one of my sliders was cooked to the perfect medium rare as I had asked the other one was closer to medium well and a little charred. The green beans while they did have great flavor they were unfortunately not very hot. John ordered the clam chowder followed by the Wagyu Cheeseburger and truffle Fries. The cheeseburger was overcooked he has asked for a medium and it came out well, the fried egg on top was not cooked nearly enough if it were mine I wouldn't of been able to eat it because it looked way to slimey, the truffle fries were about the only thing that was tasty on his plate. Overall I feel that for the meal it was 5 star pricing for 3 star quality with again the exception of the service. Maybe for dinner they are much better but I probably will not be back to try.",

From the time we stepped into the restaurant to the time we stepped out we were treated like royalty.    Excellent, attentive service.   Two of us were even given a personal tour of the restaurant by the general manager.    Food items ordered included:  french onion soup, spinach salad, chopped salad, Delmonico steak, porterhouse steak, Filet Mignon, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, green beans, chilled seared sushi grade tuna,  coconut cream pie.  We also had several bottles of wine the best of which was named \"The Boxer.\"   The bread basket they provide is also great.  All food items prepared correctly for everyone the first time.   The restaurant does have the feel of a gentleman's club and is expensive.    Give this Capital Grille location a try for your next special evening out.",

The prime rib and the lobster eggs benedict just sent us swooning, and that was before we hit the desserts.  Fabulous restaurant, and I'm hoping my sons will take me there again.  It's awfully pricey for their wallets, so maybe not.  But if your budget allows it, this is one terrific place to dine.",

    "text": "It's not normally like me to eat at a steak house, or a chain at that, and it's certainly not like me to give a chain steakhouse a 5 star rating.  But I definitely tip my cap to Cap Grille.  It's obvious why Consumer Reports rated it the #1 chain in the country.  Sure it's expensive, but the quality of the service and food is superb.  I had met someone there for a \"business\" lunch so we were both wearing black slacks - immediately after being seated the host handed us black napkins so that we wouldn't get any white fuzz on our slacks. (Brilliant!) The waiter was very friendly and described all of the options for us in great detail.  We started with the calamari which was outstanding - it blew me away that seafood could be so good in the desert (it had probably come in on the same flight I did from Boston)!  We both had 10oz sirloin steaks encrusted in ground decaf Kona coffee with a butter sauce.  Exquisite.  The waiter and bus boys were very attentive the whole meal.    I didn't find cap grille to be pretentious at all.  I mean, all of the patrons wearing suits and it cost us $60pp incl tax and tip for an app, an entree, and a drink.  So if that is pretentious (and people seem to think that is what makes a place pretentious) then fine.  But I didn't find anyone to be super snotty or rude - the service was impeccable.   I would definitely go back here or to any other location, but only for an extra special occasion or if I can claim it as a business expense and get reimbursed!",

We were seated at a dark table in the corner right next to another table where we could enjoy each others conversations whether we wanted to or not. Jarrid the waiter was in the weeds and continually ignored us the entire meal. Asking if we were ready to order and when we said yes, asked us to wait while he took our carafes back to the bar. He then proceeded to wait on the other 3 tables that arrived after us. Then came back and ask us if we were ready to order again. The food deliverer brought the dinner but, there wasn't a steak knife. After 10 minutes I was able to flag down a bus boy and he got a knife. When Jarrid did return we were through with our meal and we asked for the check. He said what no dessert and we said no, we are in a hurry headed to the theater. 15 minutes later we flagged the busboy down to get us a check. Jarrid did pickup the check with my credit card and we explained again we were in a hurry, but again we had to wait. Another 15 minutes roll by still no Jarrid, finally with no choice but to get up and find him so we could leave. On departure we noticed only half the marquee sign was lit. The food was delicious but the dining experience a large disappointment at every turn. I was with a date who had never been to Capital Grill and we will not return.",

I would say from start to finish I was thoroughly not impressed. I will honestly say that I will probably never go back to this location. It wasn't even that the food was just blah, but the fact that the staff seemed to ignore me, maybe I was under dressed for this establishment.

Old country club decor, servers that can barely crack a smile, and the food is a poor value. The good dishes were the lobster crab cake appetizer which had large chunks of lobster and a fresh corn salsa, and the spinach salad.  Both of our steaks were ordered med rare and came out rare. We sent them back and the filet was ok but my kc strip was still rare in the center. The filet was very bland even though it was served with a pathetic portion of cippolini onions, mushrooms, and a sauce. The kc strip with roquefort cheese and crispy onions on top could have been amazing if cooked properly though it can't really hold a candle to Mastros. Dessert was unimpressive as well and really uninspired. Obviously left feeling disappointed and bewildered how this place stays in business with so many amazing restaurants around...",

    "text": "Hubby and I decided to have a celebratory (new job) dinner, and were tempted by all the recent Yelp steak house debates to try Mastro's. But while going through a pile of mail I had set aside as junk, I found a $50 off postcard from AM-EX to Capital Grille. We decided to give it a try and save Mastro's for another time.  The service was fantastic. Our waiter, Reuben, was just the right amount of attentive (I hate being asked after practically every bite if everything is ok), and the other staff was also excellent.  We got a basket of bread to start, which also held some matzo-like crackers. Don't pass by the dark bread- I thought it was regular pumpernickel at first, but it had a wonderful crust with a soft and slightly fruity center- totally unexpected and delicious. We also received an amuse- a great little bruchetta topped with micro greens.  I ordered the caprese salad which was good, especially the yellow tomato slice, but I have had better mozzarella at Cibo. Hubby had the French Onion soup which came with a ridiculous amount of torch-melted cheese on top. The soup itself had great flavor (one of the best I've had), but could have been a little hotter for my taste. Hubby liked it the way it was.  For our entrees, Hubby got the Kona crusted sirloin (which was rubbed with a blend of decaf coffee powder, cocoa, and cinnamon) with shallot butter. He really enjoyed the flavor, although about half of his steak was really much more medium than medium rare. To me, the flavor was unexpected- I thought I would taste any one of the rub flavors before I tasted the steak, as they are all strong flavors. That was not the case, however- it was a subtle yet complex addition to the beef. I had the classic Delmonico rib-eye. Mine was perfectly done and quite tasty, although I must say that I have enjoyed my rib-eye at Bobby Q's every bit as much. The sides were fine- we tried the mushroom mix and the lobster mac n' cheese. We have been spoiled by our CraftSteak hen-of-the-woods mushroom ecstasy experience, so all else pales in comparison. I expected more from the mac- it was sort of mild and bland. I'm not sure what it needed- something that wouldn't overwhelm the lobster, but something nonetheless. Because we wanted to try a dessert, we took home plenty of food (the sides are large, and all share-able by 2-4 people).  We shared the coconut cream pie, which again was more than enough for two. It was in a tart style with a sugar cookie type crust, topped with a layer that we felt had cream cheese in it, then a layer of custard cream, covered by a mountain of fresh whipped barely sweetened cream and toasted coconut flakes. It was really delicious. The house blend coffee was truly outstanding, without even a hint of acidity. Hubby added Frangelico to his, and it was so good and rich that it did not need the cream he would have otherwise added.   All in all, Capital Grille gave us a very pleasant dining experience (aside from a couple of wasted chicks who were way too loud), and very good food.",

Without asking, one of the server assistants brought me out several extra napkins to help with my messy baby.  The cons: Our server (Ruben) however was clearly having an off day. The reasons I say this is clearly The Capital Grille has high service standards, and when it came to that aspect of our dining experience, we really felt it lacking. Considering our tab was over $500 and his gratuity was three-digits, he didn't seem very happy to be there. His demeanor was cold and at times bordering on rude. I will say however, he technically met our needs, asked us for what we needed/wanted, it was just an issue with his demeanor. Lastly, the food left a bit to be desired. Some of the dishes looked and tasted great, however one of our party had an over-cooked NY Strip, and plating was subpar. Dishes costing this much (regardless of being a part of a brunch deal), should have exquisite presentation.  Overall, we will be back because past experiences have been great, and food was great those times. The reason we did not say anything at the restaurant was because we were guests. I feel ashamed that our party host spent the amount that they did, considering this experience alone.",

I've made up my mind to have no regrets Recline myself, resign myself, I'm not through yet I always get what I aim for And your food is what I came for!  Nice classy touch as I walked in with a swagger.  Sham-pania sir? Why yes Lurch!  Kudos to Lindsey! Capital Grille was definitely different.  I really enjoy dressing up, but I wish it was little cooler to bust out my blazer, but all is well.  Did anybody checkout the ice sculpture of Yelp -- that was impressive!  Made my random shot of the day!  Sandwiches were amazing, my favorite with the crab cake sandwich yum!  I love crab cakes, but who know to put it between a bun and make it a burger.  The Filet sandwich was soft; I thought it would've slide right off after the first bite, but nope!  The raspberry champagne was best I have to add. - Enjoy",

Unlike most spots these days, they insisted that we not close out our bar tab and instead transferred it to our table so that we didn't have to hassle with it.   I was pleasantly surprised since it seems so many places now do not want to do that even if they can.  That said, I can no longer remember what my girlfriend and I had for dinner, as it has been almost three months since we were there, but I can say that it was all excellent.  My initial review, when I started writing it, was to be 5 stars, and my memory of the evening (even though I can't remember the specifics) remains 5 stars.    This was an excellent choice for our V Day dinner, highly recommend.  I really don't think you can go wrong with Capital Grill.",

We started off with a cup of clam chowder, next I chose a NY strip based on our server's suggestion over the filet mignon. I was concerned that the NY strip would be \"tough\" but since it was dry aged, she assured me that it wouldn't be that tough. She was right and I was so full that I bought home the other half. My husband ordered the lobster frittata which was really good. The lobster tails were so sweet!  We have never had a bad meal here and having great service made this meal even better!!!",

The atmosphere was excellent, our waiter was exceptional and stayed on top of our meal. The \"Sam's\" mashed potatoes were exceptional and were the green beans.  My FILET MIGNON was done to perfection and cut easily.  My wife's FILET MIGNON  was cooked properly but the meat was tough and stringy, a huge disappointment. For the price we paid I expected a better cut of meat.  Other items on the menu might be very good but we will never know as we will not go back.  There are other fine dining options in the Phoenix area and we plan to explore as many of the top 10 OpenTable restaurants  in the next few months.",

Just to be apart of their \"locker club\", which just stores your favorite wines (that you have to pay for in addition to the locker fee), it costs $300. This is meant for snooty types that like to impress people.   Anyway, I've been able to sample some of their food, no expense to me THANK GOODNESS, and everything was delicious.  It is like they have someone singing sweet lullabies and nurturing each plate of food in the back.  If you get a chance, book their cozy back room for a private party. I believe the booking is free. Can you believe that?? Or maybe I'm wrong.",

Food was nothing special for the price.  I have been to many steak houses of the same level and there was no comparison in food.  I ordered the Kona Sirloin.  Tasted good, but the cut was not cooked to order (med rare) and tough.  I found out later that I was not the only person that was disappointed with their meal.  Sides were good, but no different than a mid-tier restaurant at half the price.  Drinks were ok.  For a high-end steak house I would have expected a better, more rare bourbon list.  Wine was interesting and good.    If I was with a smaller group I would have sent the steak back, but timing was an issue.  Would recommend trying another steak house.",

    "text": "Conclusion: Top notch, great service and great food.  The breakdown:  I would say a good dining experience is the sum of the food, the environment, and the service.  So...the lady and I decided on a whim that the Capital Grille would be the AZ Restaurant pick of the evening. We went after late evening at work...my environment is pretty casual, so I was in t-shirt and shorts. Even on a Tu night it seemed the general atmosphere was business casual.  We were greeted and seated as soon as we came in and appeared no judgments were made. We then waited.  ....and waited.....and waited.  I was beginning to wonder if they didn't like my attire or something.  We noticed it seemed there was a huddle between the wait staff wondering who would take our table. Still no one.  I got up to use the rest room and when I got back my lady said they were bringing out some calamari on the house for our wait.  Sweet!  I generally don't care one anyone the other about calamari...but theirs was really good.  A bit of. A spice, a little kick...but quite tasty.  The waiter was extremely apologetic about our wait and was on top of everything afterwards.  I got the bone in sirloin, lady the filet.  Both were very tasty and cooked to our liking.  The mashed potatoes were delicious...creamy and buttery tasting.  Green beans tasty and crisp.  The espresso chocolate cake dessert...oh my was it rich.  A little chocolate sauce or more raspberry sauce would have been a welcome addition to the dollop of whip cream and raspberries but it was still tasty..   But the final action that really put the experience over the top was when the bill was supposed to come and instead the manager said dinner was on them.  They did not want to leave us with a bad experience (esp. considering it was our first time there.). I tried telling him this was unnecessary as they already more than made up for many issues.  They insisted...so the waiter ended up with a pretty good tip out of it.  That was all class though and made me feel quite good about our dining choice. The way they handled things and the food quality even prior to that would have gotten them at least 4 stars.  But the fact they have proven themselves a class act...that puts them over the top.  We will be back.",

This was NOT teh case with The Capital Grille! We made a reservation and were seated promptly. Our server was super personable and not snotty in the least bit, as I've experienced in the past with some of the high-end steakhouses. We were promptly sat and presented with menus and a drink menu. They had an extensive wine by the glass list and bottle list. WE started with the calimari with spicy peppers and pimento. Great dish, perfectly cooked fried calimari tossed with spicy peppers and garlic butter. i went with the house special, Kona crusted steak  (I switched the traditional sirloin for Delmonico) with shallot butter. Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! We also ordered the cream corn with bacon (most of the veggies, you can get in half orders and that's PLENTY for two people). The wife just had a cup of chowder and a great spinach salad with bacon, onions and bacon vinaigrette. All in all, great meal and awesome service. I can't wait to go back!",

My steak was done perfectly and the twice baked potatoes were the best I've ever had.  Much has been written about the lobster mac & cheese and every mouthful was worth a mention. The bartender made the best mojitos in the Valley and even dropped by our table to ensure our cocktails were to our liking!  It's not often that a bartender checks in on the diners.  Everything about The Capital Grille exceeded our expectations.",

    "text": "I celebrated my birthday at Capital Grille, the Biltmore location.  Prior to my birthday dinner I've been to Capital Grille quite a few times in Washington, DC for business meetings and dinners, but never for a celebration.  Initially when my then - boyfriend said we were going to Capital Grille for my birthday dinner I kind of thought, \"Oh great -_-\" but smiled anyway.  When I arrived and sat down at my table I was soooooo happy.  My face lit up!  The menu was personalized to say, \"Happy Birthday Erica, Enjoy!\"  The table was lit with candles and a nice bottle of red wine was sitting there waiting on me.  I love when I have a reservation and the waitress calls me by name.  I really like that!  So immediately upon sitting down, the waitress greeted us, introduced herself and asked me if I wanted to start with any appetizers ... by Name.  We started with oysters on the half shell because no matter where I am, or what state I'm in I absolutely have to have oysters on the half shell if they're on the menu and a cup of clam chowder.  Delicious!  Absolutely no complaints there.  I'm not a huge, huge steak eater so we shared a steak dinner.  We ordered and shared the Gorgonzola and Truffle Dry Aged NY Strip with Cabernet Reduction, cooked Medium.  It was PERFECT!  Totally cooked to perfection.  I don't remember how many ounces the steak was but when we ordered it and asked to split it, the chef was kind enough to split it in the kitchen and served the steak on 2 plates.  It was huge!  I can't imagine eating that steak alone.  The Gorgonzola and Cabernet Reduction complimented the steak so much.  It was mouthwatering! For sides we shared the creamed spinach and Sam's Potatoes.  The creamed spinach was tasty, but the Sam's potatoes were out of this world good.  Get them with your steak ... you won't be disappointed.   Immediately upon wrapping up dinner our waitress and about 3 other servers came out of the kitchen with the most beautiful dessert plate that read ... Happy Birthday Erica, written beautifully in Raspberry sauce ... Yes ... I dipped my finger into that too!  I would highly recommend Capital Grille for business lunches and meetings, date night, a solo dinner or a celebratory dinner of some sort.  They pay so much attention to your requests ... It was a lovely dinner and I can't wait to return.",

He went to open the door and it was locked. We knocked and the hostess just looked at us and shook her head, then mouthed \"I can't\", and then eventually just ignored us. A few moments later another patron was leaving, so my colleague was able to get back in. The hostess protested and said that he was not allowed back in. I was not in the restaurant but I assume he just walked past her, walked to the table, got his missing item, and was back out, all in about 45 seconds. All they had to do was open the door, ask what we needed, explain their policy of not letting people back into the restaurant, and then offering to find the item. I get \"policy\" but there is also something called good customer service and common sense. Our group was over 20 people and spent between $4000 and $5000, but good, respectful, worldclass service, should be offered to a single patron spending $20. This could have been a great review if not for the staff not understanding that it's the little things that can make or break an experience.  I guess, in the future when we're looking to host a decent sized dinner, we'll go somewhere where a Dr. Jeckle experience doesn't turn into a Mr. Hyde one when the door closes.",

They serve food at the bar, but my favorite appetizer thus far is the Pan-fried Calamari it's the perfect savory, spicy, fried treat to pair with a cool chilled drink!  The service is always great, bartenders are easy to talk to and never pushy. The ambience of the bar is like that of the restaurant, it's dark and laid back.

The plate was $20.00 and not worth it. My coworkers ordered the Caesar Salad with chicken also from the lunch menu ($17.00) none of the 3 ordered had chicken it was what seemed like $2.00 small salad. Last, coworker had the cheeseburger was not great.  Overall I would not go again and not recommend to a friend. Sorry Mr.Capital you disappointed.",

    "text": "I took advantage of the restaurant week to try out this restaurant.  There are several other steak restaurants closer to my house and never had an opportunity to try this location.. After my visit, why did I wait so long to try here?  They have complimentary valet, and I recommend using this service.  Parking across is $2 or free with validated ticket for up to two hours, or park so far away and walk... or just pull up by the entrance and enjoy great valet service.  When we finished dining, the server suggested to give the valet ticket to him so by the time we were outside, the car was already ready waiting and we didn't have to wait for a few mins.  Very nice service, especially when I didn't want to walk more than 10 steps with my heels.  We arrived a few mins before our reservation time. It was Saturday peak dinner and they were busy.  We found two stools in the bar area and started enjoying our drink. The bartender was very nice and offered complimentary bar nuts.  They were sweet and spicy, so yummy I thought I could get addicted to this nuts.  They had our table ready 20 mins after our original reservation time, and apologized for the delay.  They offer black or white linen cloth napkins depending on the colors of your clothes.  For the restaurant week 2015 menu, they have a choice of salad (wedge or caesar) or soup. Entree of two types of steak, fish, and can't remember the last one. Entree comes with two side dishes of mushed potato and sauteed green beans.  To finish the meal, they had three different choice of desert.  Wedge salad I had was very good, creamy dressing complimented lettuces and crispy bacon.  I actually became full just after finishing the salad. (Must be the bar nuts? or could be large lunch I had earlier).  I ate about 1/3 of my steak. Too bad I wasn't hungry enough to finish it. They used very good beef. I could taste a very good beef.  I asked them to put my desert to go as I couldn't even eat my steak, but I tasted my friend's desert, Creme brulee.  They were really good.  I ate my desert a day later, and my espresso cake was good as well.  Service was excellent. I mean really excellent. I can't even find one thing to complain.  Capital Grille is located throughout the United States. If the service and food is consistent everywhere, this will be a great place to dine for many different occasions.",

Our waters were always filled up and people were so polite and always wanting to provide us service in any way. The drinks were strong and we absolutely loved the calamari here (very distinguished from any other calamari I have tried considering the added pepperoncini.  I had the surf n turf special while my boyfriend got the Porcini rubbed bone in ribeye (w the 15-year basalmic vinegar).  The filet on my dish was cooked perfectly and the lobster tail on mine was sweet.  The bone in ribeye definitely was paired well with the basalmic vinegar (really a nice flavor).  The portions were generous for the price and we definitely thought both meals were delicious and filling for the 2 of us.  For my birthday they gave us a dessert sampler of creme brulee and flourless chocolate espresso cake.  We thoroughly enjoyed the desserts and definitely will be back for more soon :)",

A few notes:  * The shrimp cocktail sauce lacks the kick of Mastro's \"atomic\" horseradish sauce and is blahhhhhhhh.  * I ordered the Delmonico steak which was awesome but I should not have gotten the porcini sauce/rub because I don't think balsamic vinegar belongs anywhere near a steak IMHO.  * Au Gratin potatoes had a wee too much garlic  * Lobster mac n' cheese = PHENOMENAL  Anyway, I wish I could eat here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day if money or having a heart attack wasn't an issue.",

We had supper here last night for our anniversary, which we have done for the last several years.  The waiter remembered us from the previous year including which table we sat at.  I decided to order the sea bass this time and it was perfect.  My wife had the sole which was also great.  The side dishes are equally well prepared.

The hostess was professional and even escorted us out the door after we finished.  We got calamari for appetizer, a hearty portion, no overly greased and perfectly roasted.  My entry was a Kona crushed steak and it was worthy of the $50 price for this dish.  Portion was huge, the steak seasoned perfectly, cooked medium rare just like I ordered.  We also got some mash potato sides and veggies.  The order of asparagus though could have been bigger for the price.  There were maybe 6 pieces of it on the side order.    The atmosphere is your typical \"as much dark mahagony as possible\" steakhouse decor.  Seats were comfortable, bathroom was meticulously clean.  If you have a special occasion to celebrate or if your using the expense account, this place is the place to blow it on!",

I was excited because they were on the list and only $30. However I wont talk much about the price, as the food was so good, who cares how much is cost. I feel under charged.   I love the location, the Biltmore is my fave! Easy parking, lovely staff and valet, just great. We parked in the metered lot, but you get 2 hours free with validation, easy. The hostess was just adorable, took us on the scenic route to our table; it was very busy at the time so we were avoiding a large party receiving their entrees.   The wine list is extensive, anyone can find something they will love. The prices are very good! We got a bottle of the of an Italian red wine $30, it was great! We each started with a salad, a Cesar and a field green salad. I loved the field greens, the dressing on it was just perfect, peppery and light! He loved his Cesar. Then we both picked the fillet for our entree; to die for. First is was cooked exactly as we asked, and practically melted in my mouth. Delish! They came with mashed potatoes and green beans. Both excellent! Couldn't have made them better!  Then..... my favorite part.... dessert! We got one of each to share; Creme Brule and Flour-less Espresso Chocolate Cake. I could literally eat that Creme Brule everyday of my life and it still wouldn't be enough. Amazeballs! The cake was very tasty, but being a flour-less cake is was incredibly rich, very good though!  The service was excellent! Robert, our waiter, was perfect, right on top of everything, not too pushy, and read our table very well. Thank you Robert!  We had a spectacular time. I would recommend them above all for a steak, date night, dessert, anything!",

I asked bartender to open something fresh. He was more than happy to comply. The bottle was still at room temperature, which in Phoenix generally means too warm. Places of this caliber should serve red wines at the right temp!  Capital Grille, like a lot of high-end steak houses in the Phoenix area, seem to have run off their highly experienced \"professional\" wait staff over the past couple of years. I'm sure this saves the business a few dollars in overhead, but I miss the ambiance created by highly trained waiters. Nevertheless, our server was anxious to please. (The \"busboy\" was clueless.)  I order the steak au poivre. It was excellent. Better than I recall from the last visit.  Drank a 2006 Col Solare with dinner. Special price at $100 per bottle. This was a great deal for this wine.",

They cooked my medium steak pretty well, but turned out they had switched my friend's steak and mine and his was supposed to be medium rare.  I feel a steak restaurant should know how to cook a steak.  The mashed potatoes were lumpy.  They tasted ok, and did not feel pasty but could've used some kind of flavor.  The green beans were actually pretty good.  The salmon was cooked well but the citrus based sauce was a bit too sweet.  The sauce that came on the steaks was better, but didn't have much flavor.  The steaks themselves could've used a bit of salt and pepper.  The creme brulee was pretty tasty as always but I wasn't a fan of the flourless espresso chocolate cake.    All in all, I don't think the experience and food is as put together as their competitors.  The waitress also seemed a bit joyless which didn't help the experience.  With so many better options, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.  Maybe for lunch?",

I've never been one to send back food but at a steakhouse of this caliber, do so at anytime.

Shrimp, crab, raw oysters, carving station with cuts of meat so tender no knife was needed.  The dessert choices kept kids and adults quite happy.  Some in our party took advantage of the personalized omlettes and loved them.  No one had room for the lobster eggs Benedict. Absolutely going back again.",

    "text": "WOW!!!  That's all I can say.    Well not really.  Fabulous event.  I've been to the Scottsdale location, but not in quite some time, so this was a great reminder of what a fool I am.  I should be dining here every night!  We were treated to a sampling of the offerings on their new Plates menu...mini tenderloin sliders, lobster rolls, and crab sliders, along with roasted red pepper soup, truffle fries, calamari, shrimp...  All were delectable, but gotta go with the tenderloin here.  Unbelievably tender.  I am also shocked to say I was a fan of the coconut cream pie bites.  Let me preface by saying I generally despise coconut cream pie.  No one was more shocked than I to find this was a little bite of heaven.  And the wine was poured freely along with their signature Stoli Doli (pineapple martini) and Bohemians!  But where CG really excels is service.  Everyone working the event was personable and professional...a tough combination it seems.  And the chef was at the top of the list, answering even the dumbest of questions of mine (like why you age beef to begin with).   So a huge round of applause to all the folks at Capital Grille and to Lindsey for another spectacular Elite event.  With January events at both the Pointe and Capital Grille, we're getting spoiled!",

    "text": "Sure, it's a chain steak house. But that doesnt stop it from being being one of the best steakhouses you can find in certain cities. This location is excellent.  We had the calamari to start off, which comes served with hot peppers that give it an usual, but welcome kick. I then had a cup of the lobster bisque, which was excellent and included very generous chunks of lobster meat. They bring you a hot cup of the bisque, and then pour some sherry into it for you after they put it on the table. Many bisques include sherry but I liked how adding it after it is already on the table adds to the presentation.   I had a dry aged, kona crusted, filet for an entree (Bone-in). The steak was prepared medium, as I requested. This was a great steak, the rub gave it a nice flavor, and they brought out a nice shallot butter sauce with it. We ordered the South African lobster tail as a side. This is the best lobster I've had yet, it has a distinct sweetness to it that I hadn't previously experienced. If you get a chance to eat south african lobster, don't pass it up!  Service was pretty good, very knowledgeable and attentive. Nice atmosphere.  5/5 all around",

Initial seating (less than half full dining room) was next to the kitchen.  We asked for a booth further away and the hostess complied immediately.

Hands down one of the most classiest and customer service oriented restaurants I have ever been to.   We were on our way to a concert and decided to get a bite before at a nice restaurant. Drove past the Cheesecake Factory and thought I wanted to try something different. As we were riding through the parking lot confused I just pulled up in this valet parking and said lets go and eat.  WOW did we stumble upon a gem. Upon walking in, we were greeted with a list of hosts who made us feel very welcomed. I was taken back by the decor and the surrounding of a vast array of vintage wines.   Everything about this place is first class. The service, the food, and setting. I ordered the Delmonico Steak and it was seasoned perfectly and cooked to perfection. As a order my steaks medium rare the quality of meat is priority, and the Delmonico did not disappoint. It is melt in your mouth quality steak.   The prices were what you would expect from a restaurant like that, however it is actually competitive with other prime steakhouses in the valley but you do not get this level of service.   Must visit Steakhouse for 2014!",

    "text": "Flawless service and reasonably priced gourmet cuisine are the hallmark of this fine establishment. I love it here. My Delmonico was absolute perfection, as was the bernaise sauce along with the sides.  My date had the lobster and crab stuffed shrimp, which if you think about it, is the oceanic equivalent of turducken.  Not that I'd ever eat turducken, but her ordering this dish caused me to rethink my entire value system. Maybe turducken is in my short-term future, who knows.   Which causes me to wonder why it's ok to stuff a tiny little shrimp with a bevy of other larger crustaceans in the first place. The turkey I get. It's a big motherfucker, capable of stuffing practically any other fowl inside of it. But a shrimp? If anything, they should stuff it with smaller crustaceans, like krill or something.  Anyways, I forgot what I was talking about. Oh yeah, Capital Grille. There are a lot of older people in here. One old woman in the booth next to ours was coughing up shit all through dinner which really sucked. I turned and gave her the skunk-eye, as if to say; 'Hey bitch, take your phlegmmy-ass outside and let me enjoy my meal', but she shot me a look right back, saying; 'Hey you little wad, I've got more money than anyone in this place and if I so choose, I'll dredge up as much phlegm as I want...now piss off and stop staring at me.'  All things considered, our meal was really good except for Sputum Queen in the next booth. I hope she gets pneumonia if she doesn't already. Bitch.",

I proceeded to ask for water, she poured liquid imported from Fiji. I felt important and rich.  She apologized profusely for not having hot bread from the oven... it's okay the butter made up for it... if it's rude to eat butter right off the plate into your mouth then I guess he who has the gold makes the rules.  She- the bartender didn't really socialize I was the only person there until I was almost done.  I ordered- Wedge salad and burger. She offered me choices on fries- who passes up truffled fries?  Burger ordered rare... I like rare, this was fully raw except for a teeny bit of crust which was so good but did give me a bit of a stomach ache later.  Salad was amazing Crunchy crackers were awesome Burger was HUGE well worth the $18 price, but alas I could not finish it and since I was at the Courtyard I had no fridge to take it home to save Fries were very good  Because I was the only one there my food came out too fast for me  Finally as I was wrapping up the bartender decided to be social with me... too little too late my dear, please validate my token and I will be on my way.  Super fabulous place to go and contemplate fine chain dining, I will of course return anytime I am in the area at dinner.  I highly recommend it.

However, it wasn't a problem in the bigger picture.  Todd was our server and he was friendly and casual enough for us while providing us excellent customer service and attention.

I got the chicken dish (which at the time was different than the one they have on their menu now) and some other members of my family got the filet mignon and we all shared the Au Gratin potatoes and mashed potatoes. Our first experience was fabulous. The steaks were done perfectly and my chicken was moist, delicious, and flavorful.   Unfortunately the experience has declined with each subsequent visit...  The very last time we went (early February of this year) was terrible. I had the chicken dish as well as the steaks that my family had and they were all horribly, horribly dry and bland. The chicken was the driest I've ever had in my LIFE- certainly not worth almost $30 I paid for it. And the steaks were overcooked as well! It was the biggest waste of money- I barely ate 1/3 of my meal, if even that. No one could finish their steaks either.  I'm giving The Capital Grille 2 stars because the first time we went was wonderful and all of the food was delicious. In addition, the service has always been pretty good and the atmosphere is nice. However, the experience's we've had since then have not been fitting for a restaurant of this caliber (and not to mention price). The Au Gratin potatoes have been consistently tasty, but how can you really mess up cheesy potatoes? We've been adamant on giving The Capital Grille a few more chances after the great first impression, but unfortunately we've learned that it is just too expensive of a risk after so many disappointments.",

Strawberries and cream were good, the warm chocolate cake was excellent.......but the coconut cream pie was heaven!  Service was excellent. I found the restaurant to be a bit noisy. We were seated by the kitchen and that won't happen again. We will return to experience a very nice evening.",

My girlfriend took me there for my birthday and the moment we walked in, the whole vibe was great. Jazz music with a nice setting.  Known for its seafood and steaks, ordered the only chicken plate (lol) and it was GOOD.  Then Randee brought put this cheesecake.... it was perfection with vanilla wafer crust... VANILLA WAFER CRUST!!!! I had to order another one to go.  All tjat being said. Randee Potter was the absolute best waitress. I cannot say that enough  And if she has a chance to read this, Thank you for the incredible experience",

We had the lobster bisque soup and wedge salad to start, filet mignon and lobster tail for the main course and finished it up with some simple ice cream. The lobster bisque soup was so creamy and had chucks of lobster. The wedge could've used a little more bacon but was amazing as well! The filet was so tender and literally melted in your mouth and the lobster tail was fan-freaking-tastic! We had to be rolled out of the restaurant! Our server was so attentive and gave us the whole speech on how long the meat was aged for and where it came from. We felt like royalty as they checked on ensured we were happy with everything and the manager even came over and checked on us. Cannot recommend this place enough. This is my go to every time I'm in Phoenix and will continue to go back! You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "After dining in a private room last night and considering my meal, the Capital Grille missed pretty bad.   The Manhattan was simply disappointing. I skipped ordering the Woodford Reserve bourbon as listed on the menu as there is sweet vermouth in a Manhattan and it's going to be tough for even a high rye mash bill to hold its own. I asked for a rye. Their recipe contains an Amaro which I was willing to try but it simply didn't work. It offered an abrasive aftertaste. The vermouth was from Vye. I've not had that brand on its own but it doesn't hold a candle to Carpano or Cocchi which would be more appropriate for a $$$$ restaurant.   My personal appetizer was French onion soup and it was quite tasty. Especially the cheese but I didn't ask the variety. It was very bread-y and since I'm low carb, I didn't like that but it's on me for not ordering it without or with less.   The Gorgonzola mac and cheese was acceptable...not a good opinion to hold when dining at a high end outlet. The cheese tasted more like a Mozzarella than a blue cheese. Why?  The Brussels sprouts were bland and pedestrian. My experience with them is they are difficult to make well and that's why they should be pretty terrific at a top tier restaurant.   The crab-mushrooms were mediocre too. Where's the vitality and passion in the kitchen? I should be raving by now shouldn't I?  The \"Aspen\" ribeye was ordered chef's choice and came about medium. It wasn't remotely impressive. Grain-y and a little tough. Surprisingly little fat...why on earth would it be trimmed off a ribeye of all cuts? Honestly I make better steak. The one thing they should've delivered on is a great steak for $63. Fail.  I skipped the bread and dessert as I'm low carb. Actually I did have two chocolate covered strawberries. They were okay. Good enough to have a second but again...but shouldn't I be impressed?  The atmosphere and ambiance were very nice. The service was reasonable. I noticed having to ask twice for forks when the woman on my left confiscated mine and I thought it best not to correct her.  My prior meal at the CG ten years ago was fantastic but last night was pretty far off the mark. If the meal was a third the cost, I might give them a pass...might...but our party was swindled last night.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I decided to head off to Phoenix from Anaheim, CA for our 5 year anniversary this past weekend.  I've heard of The Capital Grille before, but this was our first time.    While making reservations Saturday morning, I wrote a note about it being for our anniversary.  We got into town later than expected that evening so I called ahead to warn them of our late arrival, to which the gentleman on the phone replied, \"that's fine... we will see you soon and your table will be ready.\"    We arrived about 20 minutes late, but our table was indeed ready for us immediately.  The host was extremely nice and greated us with a, \"Happy anniversary,\" at the door (girlfriend was impressed).  Once we got to our table we noticed they had placed heart-shaped confetti, a rose, and a card that read \"Happy anniversary.\" (girlfriend even more impressed).    Our server, 'Coco', was absolutely amazing!  Very kind and helped us with any questions or concerns with a wonderful and bubbly attitude.    I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my girlfriend ordered the filet.  We also had the brussel sprouts and grilled mushrooms as sides.  As we waited for our meals (which wasn't more than 15 minutes) the chef sent us a couple of special hors d'oeurve appetizers; salmon and cheese on fresh crackers.  De-lish!    The steaks were cooked perfectly medium-rare to our liking and had the most amazing flavor (gotta love that dry-aged prime beef!).  The sprouts and mushrooms were melt-in-your-mouth delicious!    Another surprise...  After we finished off what we could of our entrees and sides, they brought out complementary champagne and an amazing chocolate cake with ice cream and marinated cherries for dessert for our special occasion.  The dish had \"Happy Anniversary\" written on it with chocolate (yes... I ate that too lol).    This was definitely one of our best fine-dining experiences... possibly THE best.  The staff, the food, the decor, the quick and outstanding service, and the extra effort... blew me away!   We will definitely pay another visit next time we are in Phoenix.    Thank you so much for making our anniversary dinner a night to remember forever, Capital Grille - Phoenix!",

The options vary by location. I had a plate of mixed veggies- grilled. It was actually a huge plate with about 5 different veggies(corn, bell peppers, mushrooms, bell peppers, broccoli).

This food will have your mouth watering every time you think about it! I went to this particular location on Valentine's Day with my husband. Everyone from the front desk hostess to the bartender and waiter was phenomenal! To have your service just as spectacular as the food is a win win combination. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and very intimate. They have a killer wine list and your waiter will break everyone of them down for you! Capital Grille is a 5 star dining experience for sure! I recommend anyone to try it at least once!",

    "text": "Where to start with this review?  I will first start with the wonderful greeting at the door by the hostesses.  I am temporarily in a wheel chair and they just couldn't be quick enough to make sure we were able to get into the door without it being awkward for me.  We had a reservation so we were immediately seated, in a very comfortable spot where my chair wouldn't inconvenience other diners.  That is very important to me, because when I go out to dine, the last thing I want is for my experience to be ruined because of other diners not being considerate.   Next, we were greeted by our server Ken, who by the way happens to be about one of the best servers I think I have ever encountered in this type of establishment.  That isn't to say that our local haunts that we frequent often are not just as good because they are, but this is about this particular experience.  Ken was extremely knowledgeable about their very extensive wine list and very knowledgeable about the specials and how things in the kitchen were prepared.  The first thing we ordered were the lobster and crab cakes. We asked if they were more meat than breading and he informed us that they were very meaty and he wasn't exaggerating.  I have a very hard time eating much especially if bread is involved.   These were amazing.  I ordered the double bone lamb chops med rare and they came out perfectly, perfectly seasoned and were very good.  My husband ordered the steak delmonico (spelling) and he ordered it med rare also (there is no point in eating it any other way)  Well Ken actually suggested that my husband order this steak medium because of the way the marbling cooked, and so it was ordered medium and he was not steered wrong.  With that we shared the lobster mac & cheese, and wow, just wow.  I am not a lobster lover by any stretch because I've always found it to taste like dirt and be very tough.  I guess the difference here is claw meat rather than a tail. Whatever the difference was, we absolutely loved it.  The only issue of the whole night was SO MUCH FOOD. That isn't a bad thing, we have a teen at home, and how many teens get rack of lamb as a doggy bag?  We did take home some desserts to share with the young one.    Now to praise the management team.  It isn't all that unusual for managers to come to your table and ask how your meal is, but I have to say that Torri and Bow went out of their way to make sure we were having a wonderful experience, and we noticed that it seemed to be just the way of doing business at the Capital Grille.  It is so nice to be just an average joe and feel like you are a VIP on a night out.  So a personal thank you to both of them for making us feel so special.   In short, you can't go wrong here.  Excellent service, excellent food that is quite frankly just as simple as it gets, and beautifully done.  A peeve of mine is having a bunch of useless stuff on my plate that just gets thrown away.  Plating can be beautiful without all that, and the Capital Grille has that down.",

We were very disappointed in our appetizer and meal. We ordered the scallops entree for our appetizer and they were sandy. Our steaks were just okay and the crab I had on my Filet Oscar was very strong. I am hoping it didn't come out of a can. Our side was creamed spinach but it should have been called garlic spinach because they put a whole bulb of garlic in it. I LOVE spinach and I couldn't eat it.  I had high hopes of a long over due date night with a delicious meal but we were let down. We won't be giving this restaurant another try; too many mistakes for the price.",

From walking in the door and being greeted to leaving, service was stellar!  I loved JT as a waiter.  When my husband told him I couldn't eat themini tenderloin sandwich he brought him because I have to eat gluten free....I'll be darned if he didn't bring me back my own plate which he'd had the kitchen make me which had no bun and some awesome mushrooms topping it.  He also checked with the chef to make sure it was completely gluten free!  Oh, my!  The drinks were good: Infused peach vodka!  Divine.....with a little raspberry floating in it!  The roasted red pepper soup?  I wanted a gallon of that stuff!  Yum.  Did I mention the plate of tenderloin he brought me was melt in the mouth good?  Foodgasm!  The grapefruit soda which was actually non alcoholic was extremely good, too.  I couldn't eat some of the food due to my gluten free status but what I was able to eat was worthy of a few trips back to walk my way through the menu!  Did I mention the truffle fries?  Excellent party all the way around!  Thank you Capital Grille, Lindsey, Gabi and all for a fantastic afternoon!  Did I mention the very savvy decor?  Or the fact that they opened early for us and nobody else was there?  Impressed!",

Now don't get me wrong, the boyfriend and I really enjoyed Capital Grill and Yelp before this event, but now my loyalty is pretty much set in stone. Wonderful job yelp organizers and capital gill employees.  Before: Capital Grill=amazing steak  Now: There is a whole world of more mind blowing non steak creations that even a vegetarian could be happy and the steaks are ridiculously special and dry aged losing 20+% of meat which makes me feel a little better that I cannot cook a steak like they do to save my life.  Before: Capital Grill is too expensive for a regular day Now: The lunch menu is fabulous, yummy, and at $16, affordable   I had no idea about the extent of care put into every dish and drink (14 day pineapple vodka soak that is out of this world or the yummy marinated raspberry and delicious grapefruit soda that is just as beautiful as it is tasty). Even the dessert was fabulous.  I would almost say I am happy these events don't come around too often, but it is way worth the calories. Can't wait to come back for more!",

I've never seen such a well-trained, well-oiled machine, that serves great drinks, decent priced wine ($30 for a bottle of Liberty School Cab!) and amazing food.  They will let you order half-orders of sides, which is nice.  No split plate charge either!  When splitting entrees/steaks, etc., they can do that for you in the kitchen, which is also nice.  The Calamari app is very good.   The $15 Ahi Tuna app (bar area only I believe) IS AMAZING.  The bone-in NY Strip cooked to perfection (Rare plus).  Side of mushrooms and green beans were very good as well.  Never had a bad experience here.  They treat you right and the food is fantastic.",

    "text": "AMAZING... let me start off with that.  So I originally made reservations to Ruth's Chris for my boyfriend's birthday dinner but I saw the menu for Capital Grille and immediately changed my mind and I'm so glad I did.  I made reservations on their website and mentioned it was my boyfriends birthday.  When we got there, the host and manager both greeted us and were very professional, wishes my boyfriend a happy birthday.  They let us sit at the bar for drinks before we sat down to dinner since the table wasn't ready yet. When we got to the table, there was a card signed by all the staff, happy birthday confetti that lined down the table it was wonderful.  The atmosphere was very welcoming, it was dim and very elegant but not overly done which I liked.  The bread they provided was warm and delicious.  We ordered the calamari for appetizer and let me just say... if you love calamari, THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE!!! its perfectly seasoned, breaded and crispy, and its mixed with banana peppers and tomato which give it a nice kick and some jazz. LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVVVVVED IT!  We then shared the porterhouse steak 28oz and it was delicious and perfectly cooked, a little colder than I would like it but at least they cooked it right.  We also ordered the lobster mac and cheese and paramasean truffle fries as our sides.  Way too much food for the both of us, we had to take half the steak, most of the mac and cheese and fries home but they were all delicious.  The service was amazing, our server was on point and very good, she knew the menu really well and explained everything to us.  The overall experience was a 10.  After our meal, the server came out with a slice of chocolate mousse cake with a lit candle for my boyfriend and it was on the house! They are so generous.  I'm a food junkie and I love food and this is by far my favorite, quality, restaurant.",

The scalloped potatoes and brussel sprouts were a good addition and came with more than enough for two people to share, superb side dishes! Rebecca our server was informative and courteous. I come to expect a level of professionalism when paying a considerable amount for a meal and unfortunately the experience was just not up to par on the prices they command in that ice teas were brought initially and then never refilled after the meal had started. A bottle of wine would have likely been ordered had we been checked on until after our meal was finished but we were not. In using the restroom I did find servers and hostesses that were in the customer bathroom complaining about whos got whos tables which just left a really bad impression. I just feel like the overall experience based upon these occurrences left a bad taste in my mouth, a finer dining experience should behold a level of professionalism that was just not delivered.",

Or waiter Ken was a bit pretentious which was a strange and off putting. Personality aside, the service was definitely lacking.  Bottom line, we'll never go back. If I want to drop $200 on a meal, I'll go to the Salt Cellar or the Rolerij.",

    "text": "I suppose that this is one of those restaurants who treat their regulars well and don't give a sh*t about new clients. It was Mother's Day when we went and I understand, things get pretty hectic on a holiday. First, our server Michael always seemed to be in a rush, flitting in and out like a damn butterfly but not really paying much attention to our table -- kind of  a forced and bored indifferent attitude, moving and walking fast to give the impression he can't be bothered. Then we order two 50$ plates of steak and they can't even get it right. It's either they cooked it wrong or they just swapped the orders. We didn't even bother. At that point, we'd been in the restaurant for 1.5 hours, and that had been 30 minutes after finishing the appetizers and salads and soups. It was just ridiculous. If I'm paying $300 for a meal for 4 people, I expect the service to be top-notch, the food something to write home about. There's simply no margin for error at this price point! The scallops were too salty, the steaks not properly cooked, the salmon just alright. The manager did take one of the plates off our bill and Mr. Michael (note the sarcasm) gave us a voucher for one calamari. But let me tell you something, I do not want to go to a place where service and food quality are probabilistic, when there's a chance it can be very good or very bad. I don't think a plate of calamari makes up for a ruined experience. I don't think I'll ever go back to this place again, there are just too many other options.   We'd been to A Different Pointe of View, Elements, and all those fancy restaurants. You're better off going to one of those places if you're willing to pay hundreds of dollars for a meal.   I understand I do not have much reviews here in Yelp which tells you how strongly I feel about my experience in this place. If they dare dispute this review, I will contact Yelp myself and send them a copy of the receipt.",

The service is not bad. A bit slowly, but probably it is their idea - those who go to this restaurant are not in rush. Also, we had had a big menu card, and had no idea where to put it in between appetizers, salads and entrees as we need to order them consistently, like salads only after we done with appetizers and so on. They should think about that and provide some option to not to hold those big cards on hands all the time. This took off one star. It is pricy.  We have had dinner for 5, with vine, it costed more than $600. This is why I'm giving 3 stars. If it has a bit less prices it would be great, but so far it seems to me overpriced.",

    "text": "How have I not written a review for The Capital Grille until now? Three words: Coconut Cream Pie. I'm not even a fan of coconut or these types of desserts, but whatever they put in this dessert is addicting. It's the combination of creamy coconut filling, with a flaky yet soft crust and then the very best part is the caramel. I could eat an entire serving on my own. So whatever you do, don't stuff yourself too much on the delicious steak so you miss out on this dessert!  Now on to the rest of the meal. This Capital Grille has a great location, very friendly staff and a great environment...not to mention the amazing food! Not only do they have a large selection of comfortable booths, but they also have a private room in the back that's perfect for hosting a large group. I've been to a luncheon in the private room before and it was very comfortable.   The steak here is top quality and fresh! It's tender to the touch and better with each bite. I absolutely love their Lobster Mac N Cheese along with their Au Gratin potatoes. Get both and happily roll out of their like I do! My favorite meal consists of a the Capital Grille chopped salad, the Filet Oscar (topped with crab meat), sharing the Lobster Mac and Au Gratin and completing the gluttonous experience with the Coconut Cream Pie. It's worth every calorie and then some.   Important Notes:  - They serve lunch and often do amazing three course lunch specials.   - During the summer, they do dining after dark which means they offer a special prix fix menu starting after 8 PM that includes an appetizer, two entrees, two drinks and dessert all for $50!  - Make a reservation, especially on weekends and during the busy season.   A special fun fact:   - I learned an amazing piece of information about their giving. Every day, they give away all the left over food to a local charity, so no food goes to waste!",

Had us laughing throughout the whole night. The shrimp appetizers were perfect, on point, and fresh.   The salad was organic,  it was fresh, it tasted good.  The seating arrangements what was well spaced. Made me feel very comfortable eating here. Now let's talk about it entree. I had the well-done fillet mignon and let me tell you it was on point it was on point, not  medium well, but well done it was butterflied right.   I'll definitely come by Kia any time next time I'm in Phoenix this'll be the first place I eat.",

    "text": "Dinner here on a Tuesday evening was good but not spectacular as I was expecting based from previous reviews and pricing. We were taken to our table within 5 minutes. The table had a place setting for two, I decided to sit in the chair that didn't have the setting. The manager came over, introduced herself and changed the place setting for me. She was cordial and quick. We didn't see her again after that. Ruben was professional and took our martini orders, excellently crafted and very strong..just the way I like. Our server Bryan was also professional and had thorough knowledge of the menu. I was expecting a larger menu but it did the job. My entree which was steak & 2 mini lobster tails was absolutely delicious. My husband also had steak and he liked it. Other than a piece of steak, nothing else comes on the large white sparce plate. For our a la carte item we shared mashed potatoes, they were good but not worth the $10.00 price. There was a bread basket served that consisted of a small assortment and it was okay. We were asked if we wanted bottled Fiji or Pelligrino water. Opting for just \"regular\" water was a big mistake as the water tasted disgusting. In general when I dine out I don't ask for bottled water just simple ice water with lemon and it's always been fine, not here. All in all, our experience was good but at over 200.00 including the gratuity we didn't walk away feeling impressed. We will stick with Steak 44 or Durant's in the future.",

Anyway,  came here for a work lunch today and could not have been more impressed. The size of their shrimp for the shrimp cocktail was more than adequate,  they were fresh, and the cocktail sauce was deeelicious. Had the Mediterranean salad which I also thoroughly enjoyed. They were very generous with the servings of the chicken on top- it was hot, moist,  and sliced thin enough to be enhance the salad but not too thin where it was skimpy. Loved the pickled red peppers and heirloom tomatoes as a twist, too. Feta was fresh and the dressing was great.    Dessert: coconut cream pie and creme brulee. Both were fantastic. I don't normally like coconut, and I had 2 helpings!   Service: great, great, great, and even had a nice chat with the new manager.   Scottsdale location is closer, but I'd definitely like a \"next time\"... my husband's birthday is coming up!",

There are only a few very rare times in your life that you receive service like this! I was blown away! He had amazing menu knowledge, kindness, humor, and a little bit of swagger! All of the ladies in my group kept talking about how unforgettable the dinner was all week! And these are women who think they're ritzy Southern California ladies!  so they just naturally expect to get what they want. I'm in awe of how well Michael accommodated us! We only had an hour and a half with a group of 14, and he just killed it! I would go back to this location just to repeat the experience! Thank you from the bottom of my heart for turning a stressful weekend into a magical one! I even forgot to mention the food was amazing!",

From the moment we entered the establishment, we were greeted by friendly and courteous hostesses, seated immediately (we had reservations), and our waiter, Ken, was delightful. The pacing was perfect; from the drinks to the bread to the taking of the order to the meal being served. My dining companion had the scallops \"plate\".  The salad was beautiful in color and texture, had just the right amount of dressing, and wasn't too large.  The scallops were as delicious as Ken had described.  The risotto was perfect. I had the salmon and avocado salad, which was done to perfection.  The portion was generous without being overwhelming.  This restaurant just moved to the top of our list; the chef and kitchen staff are outstanding, service is superb yet unobtrusive, and ambiance is spot on. We were celebrating a birthday, and the dessert was artistically presented as well as  delicious without being too much.  The cheesecake with creme brule topping was light and creamy, the chocolate flourless cake satisfied even the most discriminating chocolate lover, the berries were fresh, and the strawberry reduction added just the right touch to the dish",

The hostess asked if we were celebrating anything special and she could tell by our hesitation that we were uncomfortable divulging the fact that it was our anniversary but we told her any way.  She came back to our table and decorated it with heart confetti and presented us with a card.  Very thoughtful and classy!  We were greeted by our very friendly waitress who took our drink order and told us about the specials for the evening.  We were given a basket full of various breads, all of which were very tasty.  The waitress then brought out a cucumber salmon appetizer which we did not order but was very delicious.  I opted for the special of two filet minon tenderloins topped with shrimp scampi.  TO DIE FOR!!!  The meat was tender and cooked just right and the scampi sauce was like no scampi sauce I've ever had before which made it so delicious!  The scampi sauce on top of the steak...amazing!!!  My husband had the Dry Aged Sirloin Steak which had great flavor and was very moist and tender.  We ordered a side of asparagus to share which was also very good but maybe had a bit too much lemon flavor for my taste.  We opted to skip dessert because our meal was so filling and delicious but because it was our anniversary they brought us dessert anyway.  It consisted of a light and fluffy cheesecake brulee that was out of this world as well as a flourless chocolate cake that was also delicious.  Both desserts were served with a side of fresh berries and sauce.  Our experience at The Capital Grille was second to none and I would definitely suggest this place to anyone!!",

    "text": "I visited this place when I was on a business trip to Phoenix. My colleague and me walked out our office on a moderately warm day and were looking to grab a bite to eat.  We wandered across the street from the office into the Biltmore Mall (supposedly an upscale mall) but could not find anything to our liking.  We looked across the street and saw The Capital Grill and decided to venture into it. It is a very nice restaurant and is very tastefully decorated. Was not sure of the food when we sat down to order.  I looked at the Menu and decided to have the \"Lobster & Crab Burger\". Also ordered hand made fries with it (what the heck). If the lobster and crab were not going to clog my arteries, I was sure that the fries would do the trick!!  Was a little skeptical but my colleague also ordered the same. We looked a each other and thought that at $19 a pop for a burger it better be good.  First the fries came. Not sure if it was the hunger that was clouding the judgement but the fries were presented very nicely and were cut thin and crispy as I like it. So far so good.  The the well dressed butler (yes) served the burger with a bow and whispered \" Enjoy you meal sir\" lightly into my ears.   The burger was open faced with one half of the burger bread outside and the other half had this nice looking chunk of lobster and crab cake blended with Old Bay seasoning with a side of freshly prepared tartar sauce.   I tell you this was the best tasting crab & lobster cake I have ever had. It just melted in my mouth and I kind of licked the plate dry. It was the highlight of my day after half a day of meetings (well I need to 'fess that the other highlight was the ICC World Cup Match that I watched from 2:00 AM  - 9:00 AM).  Overall I would highly recommend this place. I am definitely coming back here on my next business trip.",

The bartender was quick with a linen napkin to wipe my face and refreshed the Campari and Coke I had begun. My depression was short and my solace began with the Bar Menu Lamb, a dozen fresh oysters with a hint of vinegar, and a native of San Diego who works as a corporate jet stewardess named Linda. I'll be back to the Capital Grille as soon as I return from San Diego!",

    "text": "I would give this Capital Grille location no stars if possible. I don't mean to be harsh, but I expect A LOT more out of restaurants that charge this much for their food. My mom, brother, boyfriend and I visited Capital Grille, mid-May, for an early birthday dinner for myself. We have never dined at a Capital Grille, but have been to the Palm several times, as well as BLT Steak restaurant group. This was our first experience and last one. We wasted almost $500 on this horrendous dining experience. Number one, we ordered a bottle of wine, it literally took our server, Ken, around 20 minutes to find the bottle of wine in their cellar. We were seated near the cellar where he was searching for the bottle, and watched him. At one point he became flustered and went to check on another table. Finally, he came to table with the wine. My brother and boyfriend started with the French Onion soup, it was decent, but overpriced for what it is. I started with the Lobster Bisque, which had to be sent back because it was cold and had butchered overcooked lobster floating on top. Ken returned with a proper bisque at the correct temperature, also decent but overpriced. My mom had the Spinach salad, very small portion, and the knife cuts were a joke. Mushrooms sliced at different widths, onions, some sliced thin, some sliced thick. Mediocre at best. We didn't even mention the salad until the end of the meal, when things had just become too much. The excuse we received was that this was the \"corporate recipe\", this is how corporate wants the vegetables sliced, in random different sizes, isn't it about presentation, especially when you pay this much? My brother ordered the Dry Aged Porterhouse, my mom ordered the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Bone In Sirloin, and I ordered the Delmonico. We also ordered their \"signature\" potato gratin, creamed spinach, and the Truffle Fries. Unimpressed in the quality and flavor of meat, I'm not sure if they were even serving Prime that day. Maybe a corporate decision? The gratin was a joke, topped with crushed potato flakes, seriously? Creamed spinach mediocre. The Fries were very good actually, but how can you mess up fries? The most disappointing and shocking moment is when Ken tried to argue with my boyfriend that the steak her ordered, the Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre, which he ordered rare, and came out medium, was rare, until he took to the kitchen and put it under the light. Then comes back to tell us that the salad is on them since we hated it, which my mom only said that it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst spinach salad she has had. They gave us an on the house coconut cream pie to go. Which I took one bite when I got home and threw it away. Very disappointing when you spend this much money and receive this type of service and quality of food. We might as well set $500 on fire.",

Ordered French onion soup and cheese was so burnt I could not eat it as it tasted terrible. I wonder why a chef would prepare then serve, as well as why it would be allowed to leave kitchen. Also wondered why server would take it to the table. Wife ordered swordfish and it was literally raw. Had to send that back as well. This is not the way to have a nice meal by eating while the other person waits for the corrected meal. Prices are high which is fine, but then so should food standards. We have eaten here before and someday may again but for now no hurry to return.",

    "text": "In a bit of an indifferent mood before ending up at TCG I did the drivers equivalent of pacing.  Litterally driving into the parking lot of a few other well known restaurants and going \"no...not feeling it\", and driving out of the parking lot without stopping.   I was intent on trying some place new.  Honestly I don't know what made me park and come into TCG, and even then when I walked in I was about ready to turn around, I wasn't wanting so upscale but decided to just go in and grab a seat at the bar.   My indeciseiveness that night extended into trying to choose what to drink and what to eat.  The bartender and the lady sitting next to me highly recommend the Stoli Doli, house infused pineapple vodka martini.  Why not? What a great recommendation.  Wonderfully simple, slightly sweet pineapple goodness in a martini glass.   Looking over the bar menu, I then asked for the full menu.  Wow the Wine list is IMPRESSIVE.  The menu options matched the rich darkness in the restaurant.  Sultry and romantic...I can see why there were so many couples here enjoying the ambiance.  The service is as impressive as the wine list. I finally decided, but I question my own combination of what I chose.  Obviously not that hungry, I choose the Wagyu beef carpaccio and a wedge salad( this is where I wonder what was I thinking).  I would have much happier in the end had I just had the carpaccio.   Not that it was bad....just so didn't do the restaurant justice.   It's not ment to stand out on its own.  But it satisfied something at the moment.  The rich blue cheese dressing and bacon...unfortunately iceburg lettuce is never stellar even with the dressing. The Wagyu carpaccio was beautifully plated.  Lightly seared exterior and rare interior of thinnly sliced beef accompanied by a portion of lightly dressed arugula salad and parmagian cheese.   The seared exterior had a seasoning that I am not sure that added to the dish.  I appreciate carpaccio for its simplicity. However that was my only \"issue\" and it didn't keep me from enjoying the dish.  The richness of the wagyu and the peppery arugula were perfect together.  Including tip my vist was around $50. Next time I will go with a friend or 3 who are ready for a fine meal.",

My main dish was superb & a huge portion: Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon cooked throughout, instead of seared, per my request, in Brown Butter, garnished with Marcona Almonds. The portion was huge. My friend got the Filet Mignon, medium rare, and gobbled it right up. Our table got family-style sides: Roasted Wild Mushrooms (didn't try), French Green Beans w/ Heirloom Tomatoes (fresh) and Sam's Mashed Potatoes. These potatoes are unbelievable! They're made with the skins, and so much butter & cream, they could almost qualify as dessert. Crazy good. The Creme Brulee was garnished with a few berries and featured a nice shellacking of sugar. Custard's flavor was a rich vanilla. But - big but - the actual custard itself was watery. Servers are super attentive and conscientious, replacing dirty silverware, keeping water, wine & Coke glasses filled, and always available for any questions. We were happy to dine at a local favorite and enjoy such a hearty meal. Side note: the restaurant is decorated like a lodge with buckheads and dark paintings lining the walls.",

He was a very gregarious and nice person but clearly overwhelmed when everyone arrived closely together. Overall, the wedge salad was quite good and their first course soup. My opinion is that with more and more restaurant competition, The Capital Grille, for the price, is loosing its edge.

    "text": "We celebrated our wedding anniversary here, made an Open Table reservation on a Saturday at 7:15. When we arrived, we were greeted by the hostess with a \"Happy Anniversary\" and when seated, our table was decorated with hearts, a note and a rose. Nice touch. Hunter, our server introduced himself and took our drink orders.  I ordered a Stoli Doli (pineapple infused Stoli Vodka) while perusing the menu. For appetizers we ordered the Steak Tartare, entrees were the 24 oz. Dry Aged Porterhouse Steak and Caesar Salad with the Lobster and Crab Cakes.  The service from Hunter was excellent! The cocktails were fantastic. The Steak Tartare was very good but would of been better if a well was made in the beef and a raw egg was used, more traditional. The Steak was done perfectly to request and was very good. The Lobster and Crab Cakes were delicious. The weakest part of the meal was the Caesar Salad. Dressing lacked taste, no anchovies, and soggy croutons. Hunter was gracious enough to remove it from our bill. We ended our meal with a wonderful complimentary mini dessert tasting.  My only negative comment is, when a restaurant goes all out for celebrations and to make a very upscale place to dine for its patron while paying for the quality of food and service and the table diagonal from you has 2 women wearing cut off short shorts and flip flops, it is not acceptable.  Atmosphere excellent, service excellent, food very good. Thank you for making our celebration a memorable evening!",

From my initial phone conversation with Sam and his greeting when we walked in, to my professional service experience with Rocco and the rest of the crew, we were treaded spectacularly. The \"Lobster Bisque\" is full of lobster meat and the flavor with the added sherry  and cracked pepper is world-class in my opinion. My salmon was perfectly seared and seasoned, with excellent and moist couscous. The Coconut Cream dessert extravaganza is worth extra time on the treadmill...LOL. In my opinion, if you want a truly great \"bang for you buck\", call Sam, ask for Rocco's table and just sit back and enjoy. You will be pampered.",

I told the server if they were going to call it a Brussels sprout salad then the Brussels sprouts should be the star of the show. The chef added more and re mixed my salad and it was wonderful.",

    "text": "9/22  Came to try their Restaurant Week menu, and sat at one of the tables at the bar section of the restaurant.  I liked its subdued and quaint atmosphere; however, the smooth jazz music's volume was turned up significantly as the afternoon turned into dusk.  It's a good thing I enjoy smooth jazz.  Chose the French onion soup starter, the Kona-crusted sirloin steak entree, and cheesecake w/ fresh berries sauce to finish.  I really enjoyed the onion soup- salty from the cheese, yet just enough sweetness from the caramelized onions.  I really liked how some areas of the cheese that blanketed the bowl were crispy!  I thought perhaps it was the bread that sometimes one would find below the cheese, but no, it was the cheese itself.  Wished the whole piece was crunchy...  I absolutely adored the Kona-crusted sirloin.  Cooked to medium- perfect!- and I could taste the coffee, too, and not just feel the texture of coffee grains, as I've ordered similar entrees from other venues, but never tasted the intended effect.  The caramelized shallot cream sauce absolutely floored me!  One of the best sauces that has graced my lips :)  Mmm... The entree came with two standard sides (no substitutes allowed, or at least that was what I was told) of creamed spinach and smashed red potatoes.  Both were delightful- decadently rich and creamy.  Before I forget, the table bread basket (seeded dinner rolls and lavosh) was good, especially the seeded rolls.  You may also order toasted sourdough if you have food allergies to avoid.  Stepping back down, but not much, from the piece de resistance (in this meal, the standout was the steak), was the creme brulee cheesecake w/ berry sauce w/ fresh berries!  Simply incredible!   While I had to return the more beautiful (more caramelized sugar crust) first offering, untouched, due to food issues, the second was less visually stunning, but tasted divine.  I should've asked for more sauce on the side, as I ended up taking some home.  (Believe me, it took all of my willpower to stop myself from inhaling the whole dish!)  I would definitely love to go back again!",

The waiter was not only very rude, he constantly forgot simple things and was totally unattentive... so after 5 things and 2 hrs into dinner we requested the manager who was just the same and sarcastic on top of everything else! For a $300.00 meal that was average at best. Thank goodness the company I was with was wonderful!!!! Too many other choices to be treated the way we were :( I was so disappointed that I wrote corporate headquarters! To be continued when I hear back from them!!!!",

Service was fantastic, our server John said he was the newbie at the restaurant but clearly he was not new to servicing.  I had a very good dirty martini but next time I'll get it a little dirtier. My Fil had Kiltlifter beer and when there was only 1 left they asked him if they should keep it cold for him (he said yes!). That is great service.  Appetizers: Oysters on the 1/2 shelf...delicious. And perfectly crispy Pan Fried Calamari...also delicious.  We all had the 22 oz Delmonico bone-in Ribeye., medium rare, closer to rare than medium and they were perfectly cooked! Also ordered 2 sides: the lobster mac & cheese...super cheesy with large pieces of lobster. And fresh creamed spinach in a bechamel sauce. If that wasn't enough our waiter gave us mashed potatoes because as he said \" you have to try these\".   We are still full from the experience but will be back!",

    "text": "I was very reluctant to write this review, but am so shocked that this happened, maybe it'll be of help to the restaurant.  First, let me say that the Manager was VERY professional & accommodating.  Our Buss Person was such a nice guy!  OK, here goes:  We were in for lunch (we like to go for lobster, since we've always had excellent meals).  We were seated and our waiter came to the table and informed us that it might be a longer wait than normal for us to order & get our meals.  This was the first thing he said.  He was shadowed by a new employee & I figured that it was probably difficult to train and wait tables - hence, the length of time.  We got our drinks - the exterior of my glass was sticky & looked dirty.  He took the glass and poured the ingredients into another glass (saw this-he was showing the new guy this \"procedure\").  I got the same drink with a new glass.  If a glass is dirty on the outside, what is it like on the inside?  We ordered. When we ordered the lobster, he hesitated & finally said \"yes, I guess we can do that\"  Firstly, we had the wedge salad.  It was indeed a wedge, with small green & red tomatoes.  We did not want the \"lardons\" which are like small pieces of rubber unchewable bacon - so we passed on that.  I asked the waiter specifically if they were still using those chewy things and he said yes.  The blue cheese dressing had no blue cheese chunks in it.  Prior to the salad, the bread came out with a piece of flat bread and 2 rolls like cement. The lobster came out along with the mashed potatoes.  There were so many skins in the potatoes that we had a hard time picking out the actual potatoes.  The lobster:  it was again... so tough we couldn't even cut it.  (taste of claws were good - they were more tender) - that's when we called for the Manager, who saw what we were dealing with and comped that portion of our meal - which was nice.  We then ordered 2 coconut cream pie desserts.  The pies were piled high with a completely tasteless cream (seriously-no flavor, sugar or anything), a crust that you (oh god, I hate to say it) could not get your fork into.  There was a paper thin layer of actual pie filling that was really good.  So!  There was so much wrong with meal, we were embarrassed to keep complaining!  Just glad to leave, but we felt like they were getting rid of old stuff in preparation for Valentine's Day.",

The group shared several sides including: mashed potatoes, so creamy and rich Asparagus, a little oily and with charred tips Golden beets with goat cheese, sweet and delicate And of course the lobster Mac n cheese, which I did not have but heard was excellent We took dessert to go: I chose the coconut cream pie, we were told it is a top seller.

So far we were very impressed.  We were offered fresh bread which was yummy and ordered a salad to split. The salad was okay, but not fantastic. My husband had ordered the Kona Sirloin and I had ordered the Filet MIgnon. Up to the main course, the service had been quick and we expected the same from the steaks. We waited and waited and waited.  Finally the steaks arrived and neither of us were impressed. I had ordered Medium Rare Plus because I like it nice and pink, but not red. It was too rare for my liking and the outside was more charred than I care for. My husband's sirloin was too rare and he liked my filet more. The sides we ordered were very good. I had the creamed corn which was wonderful. My husband really enjoyed his mashed potatoes.  They offered us dessert. We chose peach sorbet which was yummy. Then we waited again for our bill.   Overall, it was a decent meal and while the service started off outstanding, it declined as the meal progressed. Honestly, I have had better steaks elsewhere.",

    "text": "I was able to treat my family to dinner during my mom's visit from Puerto Rico. Many of my family haven't yet experienced TCG Phoenix yet, however I have many times. Each time I return I am blown away by the knowledge of the servers and the high level of customer service.   Terry W. was our server this time and not only was I greeted with a warm welcome and a hug (He's been my server before), he also introduced himself and shook hands with everyone in my party. He was friendly, made conversation, and I'm pretty sure became friends with my mother - they were exchanging travel stories and even continued the evening speaking to each other in French! I can't say enough about great things about Terry. I will be requesting him for myself, and my guests in the future. Even my 9  month old nephew lit up every time Terry came around! He is a gem and a wonderful asset to The Capital Grille. **Tip: Your server will always have the best recommendation for you if you aren't sure what you want, but can tell them what you like.**  Torri M. is such a wonderful person. She's sweet, friendly, and always on top of things. I have worked with her for years, and I can't thank her enough for her generosity and kindness. I always look forward to seeing and speaking with her!  Great food & service is great food & service - chain or not. The Capital Grille Phoenix definitely sets the bar to new heights for excellence in service. Any restaurant that wants to consider themselves to be a competitor in Food & Beverage should look to TGC Phoenix as a role model. They will always have my business.",

But starting with Chris, a thoughtful and intelligent waiter, our experience was magical. Excellent wine, great food and kind service made our last meal in Arizona one of the best. A complimentary desert and champagne from our waiter,  just so we would have fond memories of Scottsdale, cinched the experience. We'll be back!  This is my first yelp review. I've never been moved by food or service to take the time to review.",

This is a place to take the other members of the board to discuss serious matters pertaining to corporate governance. There is nothing silly or frivolous in it. The lights are just bright enough to underline the respectability of it all.   In short, the decor has got the sort of overstuffed-leather-chair solidity that compliments the stern quality of the offerings. The lunch specials are a good value at about $16 bucks for a variety of high-quality plates. Service is something close to splendid.

    "text": "My wife and I went here during restaurant week. I had been wanting to go here and give them a try and this was the incentive I needed. Our waiter Jorge was one of the best waiters I have ever had. He gets 5 stars. He was never in the way. He came to your table when you needed something almost like he was reading your thoughts. He was no where around but when I dropped a fork, he was there with another fork in 30 seconds. If you go you probably can't get the waiter you want but if you can ask for Jorge. You will be very pleased. During restaurant week they have some set menu items for a set amount of dollars. Of course you can still get what you want off the regular menu.  I don't remember the cut of beef I got but I got a steak and my wife got a Filet. She said hers was very good. I got mine rare. Most places think when you order rare you really want medium rare. They did cook the meat exactly the way I like, a little fleshy in the center. My steak was good but not excellent. A little tough. We ordered the green beans. This was a huge disappointment. I am not sure where this started but green beans need to be mature and cooked, not picked before there is a bean in it and warmed up. Yes I know this seems to be the way you get them everywhere. I was raised where you go into the garden, pick the beans, string the beans, break them into 1 to 1.5 inch pieces. When cooked they are to die for. But now everyone seems to think a immature half cooked bean is the way to fix them.  The potatoes were good and our deserts were good.  If they knew how to cook green beans they might of got 5 stars.  Have a great day enjoy good food.",

    "text": "Huh.  Dang.  Darn it.  Shoot.  I was really looking forward to lunch here.  Parking at this location is beyond ridiculous, no, I didn't valet cause I wanted to shop after wards.  But who cares?  I was here for a great meal!  Things started off well, great folks at the hostess desk.  Attractive interior, beautiful dark rich woods, attractive lighting, dark plantation blinds, very nice table.  My server Paula was extremely nice and had the cutest accent.  I liked a lot of the choices on the menu, but on an impulse, decided on the salad with filet medallions and onions straws.  The first bite of steak was extraordinary, perfectly cooked, wonderful seasonings and flavor.  Fresh pieces of asparagus in the salad was a nice surprise.  Then the shocker.  The next medallion was under cooked, the next was over cooked and the rest were grisley.  Needless to say, I could not eat it.  My server was very apologetic.  And then the manager immediately appeared as if he had been shot out of a canon.  He apologized profusely.  I was very understanding, I mean everyone has a bad day, right?   And of course he offered another dish, but I declined.  I mean, the mood was gone.  But then again, this is why I don't eat at home. The salad was taken off my check, as should be expected.  I did have dessert, hell yes, I was still hungry!  I got the hazelnut chocolate cake, which was totally awesome and even pretty to look at.  It was big enough to feed an army, don't know if it was a regular slice or if they were trying to make up for the salad.  So, a really mixed review.  I will try Capital Grill, again.  And I hope to have much better results.",

    "text": "The Capital Grille in Phoenix has the best steaks I have ever tasted. You will never be disappointed when going here, whether it's for a special occasion or just for dinner. You can't go wrong when you go here. It doesn't matter if you like steak or not, this place will make it your favorite food. Their impressive menu of nationally renowned dry aged steaks and the freshest of seafood will ignite your culinary imagination as their award-winning wine list of more than 5,000 bottles awakens your inner sommelier. I can never think about steaks the same again after eating here, the best by far is the Kona crusted sirloin. I have never heard of it before but wow was it amazing. Great cut of meat and the sauce was to die for. The French onion soup was great, very light. The soup didn't really grab my attention until I got home and was craving it. Every side dish I had was also great, the mashed potatoes were by far the best; they were hot, cheesy, and just wonderful. I never even though about putting salt or pepper on anything. Everything was perfectly seasoned and amazing. I never have really liked coconut cream pie but I enjoyed this one, so moist and creamy. The creme brulee was a little rich but the fresh fruit they put on top made it much better. Dinner ran about 60 dollars a person not including the wine. It was by far one of the most expensive meals that I have had but it was well worth it and I will most likely be going back. The service is customarily outstanding and the staff's wine and food knowledge is exceedingly above board. The waiters were well dressed and were well spoken. It was great not to have some ditsy waitress for once! No matter what questions you have regarding the restaurant they know it all. The decor is just what I expect from an old school traditional steakhouse, dark wood, cigar humidor, and oil paintings. It not overwhelming and it has this sort of calming effect. It is so much quieter than other restaurants, people talk in a low voice so you can actually hear what your waiter is saying. Everything was very clean; I don't think I could find a piece of old food anywhere if I tried. I would definitely dress a little nicer than you would at other restaurants. They don't care if you just show up in jeans and a tee-shirt but you will definitely stand out. When I went it was a surprise and wow was I underdressed. I felt so out of place and like I didn't belong. I wouldn't recommend this place to bring your children, so I would get a babysitter. You don't want your fantastic meal ruined by screaming children. For larger parties, they have a conference room in a secluded, closed off area. Whether you are having a business meeting or just a party, it is perfect for any occasion. Reservations are not need except for Friday and Saturday nights; don't expect to even see a table on these days without one. On a crowded night parking is a nightmare, I would recommend that you either make reservations really early, really late, or use the valet that they have. I wouldn't recommend going here if it is last minute because you will be waiting for a long time. The American Culinary Federation recently bestowed upon The Capital Grille the \"Achievement of Excellence Award.\" The Arizona Republic said the dry-aged steaks are, \"gloriously beefy and juicy, lightly seasoned and utterly delicious.\" You cant get a review like that if you are just any restaurant, they earned that award for sure. The only part that wasn't one hundred percent to my liking was the temperature that my steak came out. It was perfectly cooked but it wasn't that warm when I got it. It seemed like they had it out on the counter waiting for the other part of the meal, but that was the only thing that didn't meet my standards which is very good for a restaurant. I would highly recommend The Capital Grille to anyone wishing a special dining experience. The place is a little pricy but great places like this should be and believe me, it is money well spent. Best steaks, appetizers, soups, and desserts. Why go anywhere else?",

Location/Ambience:  Located in a mall (like a lot of Capital Grilles).  Typical dark steakhouse type of ambience.  Great for business and romantic dinners.  They have a nice private room that can handle up to 40 guest.  For the presentation screen, they have a flat screen tv.  Service:  I think this was their strong point.  From the moment you walk in, the service was amazing.  There were 2-3 guys assigned to the room.  Drink orders taken and constantly refilled.  The AV guy was very helpful.  Orders were taken and food brought out in a timely fashion.  You can tell that they have dinner presentations down pat.  I requested my meal for togo and ti was packed nicely.  Only thing was that they had no togo drink cups. Food:  Was just ok.  I opted for the kona rubbed bone in sirloin.  I have never had a boned in sirloin (that was all that was offered) and will prob not again.  Mash potatoes were avg and veggies were good.   All in all, I really appreciate the great service.  I would love to go back and try their other cuts of steak.  But as far as having a dinner presentation there...A+",

We arrived about 10 minutes early and our car service was met with awesome valet guys. We sat at the bar and had pre-dinner cocktails. I've always been treated so well at this particular Capital Grille from valet to valet. I love that when your table is ready they take your tab and your drink for you to your table. This night was our anniversary of a year and our table had rose petals scattered all over it. How nice is that?! We started with a seafood tower. It's our one year and hey, relationships these days that last, deserve pomp and treats! Well.. We like bubbles and food! This seafood tower was divine and we aren't large people; as soon as it arrived, I knew we were in over our heads! Oh well, you only live once .. Spend well! Next we both ordered the filet mignons. My go to steak. I know they do it right and perfect it was this night. We opted for the mashed potatoes and a salad, as well. I think we both had two bites and were stuffed! Our waiter was spot on perfect. So friendly, you can see why Capital Grille is one of the top notch steak houses. He suggested the perfect merlot to pair our filet with and even brought us a complimentary vodka Stoli vanilla cream cordial after dinner drink, just because! As if we weren't stuffed enough and had not been spoiled by the staff enough on our special night, out comes a dessert tray with a chocolate cursive writing of, ' Happy Anniversary!', around several small dessert samplings. So wonderful! I love a classy restaurant like this that loves it's customers and shows it this way. It's a splurge and it's worth it, every single time! Oh.. We even got two little truffles in a cute little Capital Grille box to take home :-)",

The room's dimply-lit interior is decorated with dark mahogany wood, and paintings that look like they're from the 17th century.  The leather booths and tables all have white tablecloths with inviting wine glasses.  The servers are well knowledgeable about the menu, and their steak preparation.  They are very attentive too.

Had both the same choices: the White Cheddar Potato and Leek Soup (creamy, exquisitely delicious!), and the Grilled Jumbo Shrimp and Vegetable Couscous - a most generous portion (4 great shrimps), and an exquisite Couscous prepared better than on the Mediterranean shores where the dish originated (we should know, we spent many vacations there). Kudos to the Chef... My wife's desert (I abstained) was the Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake... absolutely out of this world, as she assured me! All in all a memorable (AND affordable) lunch - we decided to go back soon to sample the other \"Plates\" choices. Add to this the elegant, distinguished atmosphere, the sophisticated low-volume jazz/big-band (lots of Sinatra) piped in music, and last but not least, the impeccable service - who can ask for more?

Overall, it was fantastic for a special meal, and we'll probably be here again. The service was exactly what you'd expect at this caliber of restaurant. Prompt, helpful, and just a little over the top. I liked the drink menu on the iPad with photos of each drink. The steak we ordered was cooked perfectly and exactly how we wanted it. The calamari was interesting, as I've never had or even fathomed it with peppers. I worked around those and the squid itself was good, and DH enjoyed the peppers. We had the mac and cheese and enjoyed that as well. DH liked the Stolli, their signature martini and mine was good as well.",

Capitale Grille is awesome.  I've known about them the entire 6 years I've lived here, but never made it in.  Why? Because I just haven't, and now I NEED to come back here.    For starters, this event was awesome.  Smaller, intimate set in a great location with top notch food.  The staff here is like no other.  Friendly, classy yet approachable all wrapped into one.  The staff circled with lobster rolls, red and white wine, mini tenderloin sandwiches, coconut cream pies, along with a HUGE shrimp thing that was delicious.  The chef came out and talked about how they age their meats at special temperatures, along with the fact that they always get their meat within a 10 day kill date, so its NOT sitting around forever.  So imformative!  They even had huge slabs of beef out for display!  YUMMY!!!  I cannot brag enough about this event.  The staff here is impressive, food was awesome and Lindsay did a great job planning this event.  Everyone was able to talk, there was plenty of seating, and we could hear each other!

Great ambience...paintings of local prominent people highlighted an elegant setting.  We just wanted a light dinner so selected  the cold seafood platter: 1lb lobster, 6 prawns and 6 fresh oysters.  We substituted fresh lump crab (you only have to ask) for the oysters.  After a spit wedge, it was just right. By the way, fresh, cold crisp lettuce, and good blue cheese dressing.  Nicely done.  We are from Cape Cod so we know lobster.  Perfectly cooked, so someone is watching.  Prawns and crab also correctly cooked and chilled.  Our friends split the bone in filet that was perfectly done.  The wine list was extensive and actually underpriced for the haughty Scottsdale area.  The least expensive Moet & Chardon Imperial anywhere.  Great Service with an attentive manager  that knew the food and the restaurant's history.  A must destination for a great dinner.",

I've been to STK, Maestro's Steakhouse, Dominick's, etc but I had never really heard much about Capital Grill, so I didn't know if it could compete. Well, it definitely did and it was very good!  I ordered the filet mignon and it was cooked to the perfect medium rare that I requested. We ordered sauteed spinach and mushrooms for sides - I really liked the way they did the mushrooms. For dessert we had the Creme Brulee and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake. The Creme Brulee was creamy and fantastic. The Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake was super rich and awesome.  The Captial Grill totally impressed me and I will definitely be going back.",

Once we arrived right at 7:00 they had our table ready for us and sat us within a few moments. It was a pretty busy Saturday night, so I am glad that we set reservations. Once we were seated we were immediately greeted by our waiter, who was dynamite! My glass was never half empty, our orders were 100% correct, and they have a special Mascato Di Asti that is only available to Prime Restaurants and Resorts. I loved the wine and asked him where I could buy a bottle, he explained that it is rare and usually snagged up by restaurants and top resorts first, which happens with limited selections. Without asking, he went and asked the Restaurant Director, who then brought us over a bottle at a discounted price to take home. Amazing service!  For an appetizer we ordered the Fresh Oysters, yummy! Excellent quality, cleaned, and great pairings. I am an avid steak guy and prefer my steaks either Blue Rare, Rare, Twice Seared, etc. So I ordered the Filet Oscar, Blue Rare and my steak was perfect! My wife ordered their Seared Tuna with Ginger Rice, which was excellent! You have to try their Lobster Mac and Cheese! WOWZA!!! We also ordered their Truffle French fries which were dynamite!  For dessert we had the Coconut Cream Pie and the Cheesecake. Out of this world!!!   This is a definite try for my upscale foodies.",

I'm a \"go with the flow\" kind of guy and since we were grabbing cabs I knew in an instant that a gin drink was in my near future.  There are Capital Grilles everywhere. LIKE I MEAN EVERYWHERE!  New York, DC, Denver you name it. But my friends love it. Why? Because it isn't Ruth Chris.  Is Ruth Chris a suckfest? No, not ever. But Capital Grille has a way of making each of it's locations a little more unique.  This one has the most uniqueness than ever.  Excellent attentive service. Ketchup with your steak? Sure, they won't judge. Lobster mac n cheese with chunks of lobster you can actually see (without the aid of a microscope), umm yeah and it's good.  Gin martini's? Oh Boy.  I bookmarked a local spot, but ok I walked away feeling like steak greatness was found.",

Drinks as soon as we walked in the door, wine, peach champagne cocktails and pineapple infused vodka (ranked as \"are you kidding me?!\" delicious).  Staff was everywhere to offer food or drinks, clean up a stray glass or plate, and accommodate our every request (glass of water, please).  Who doesn't love a gift bag of goodies and an invitation to come back for free lunch (again, \"are you kidding me?!\")  Haven't even started on the food yet.  Lobster rolls, tenderloin sliders, truffle fries, coconut creme pie, everything was FANTASTIC!!   The biggest shrimp I have ever enjoyed right next to the cool Yelp ice sculpture that proves YELP is the 'coolest!' (Ha!)  This was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon!

The ambiance, the service, the decor, the fine little touches that go along with a high-end restaurant were all exactly what you would expect from the CG, but unfortunately, the food just didn't live up to expectations.  I went for lunch and was looking forward to something as spectacular as the rest of the experience, and was horribly disappointed.  The clam chowder was average at best, and definitely wasn't anywhere near as good as some I've had at bar/restaurants on the pier in San Fran or Seattle.  And although I can't remember the name of the sliced steak dish with the shoestring fries on top, that's a pretty accurate description of the dish itself.  The steak itself was horrible, as it had a completely inedible piece running through the center of the entire steak. I ate around it, but seriously, this is not what I expect from a place like the CG.  It completely ruined the rest of the experience, and it's doubtful I'll ever go back for another lunch.    You never get a second chance to make a first impression.  Sorry, CG, but it wasn't a good one.",

We were greeted with smiles and extreme courtesy. Never made to feel out of place. Now let's talk about this food!! We had Beef Tenderloins With Lobster Tails, Sam's Mashed Potatoes, and sauteed spinach. Of all the steakhouses I've visit, The Capital Grille is at the top of the list. The steak and lobster were tender, delicious, and cooked to perfection. Portions were just right, we still had food to take home of which microwaved the next day with no change in taste. I'm from California and I'm overjoyed to find out we have one in driving distance. I plan to visit very soon. Thank you Capital Grille for an all around grand experience.",

    "text": "Our Anniversary Dinner  We stayed in the Biltmore area for our anniversary and decided to have dinner here. From the time we sat down, our experience was excellent. My husband had mentioned our anniversary when he made the reservation, so our table was decorated with hearts and a rose was waiting for me.  Our server was Melissa and she was friendly, experienced and attentive. She brought bread service while we had drinks and decided on our orders. For dinner, I ordered the filet and my husband ordered the bone in ribeye. Although it wasn't on the menu, he asked that his steak have a pepper crust. No problem. We shared a Caesar salad and au gratin potatoes.  The only blemish on the night was the salad. It was bland, without any garlicky or typical Caesar taste. But the steaks were large, cooked to perfection and exceedingly tender. And the potatoes were yummy, too.  We also shared a nice dessert given to us on the house. The manager also came over to wish us a happy anniversary and we had a nice conversation with him as well.  While the Capital Grille is pricey, our dinner was well worth the cost. For a special occasion, it was wonderful.",

I was there on a first date, therefore I didn't go for it and pig out. LOL! I did order a Cosmo, which was so good, I was humming after the first sip! I also had lobster/crab cakes which were full of seafood and very good.   My only unfavorable critique is that my wedge salad was over-dressed to the point where I couldn't eat it. However the wonderful waiter adjusted the check.  My date and I shared asparagus which were seasoned and prepared perfectly. The other star of the show for me were the mashed potatoes; which were the best I've ever tasted. The Cosmo had me all worked up, so I didn't have a chance to identify what's in them.  My date enjoyed his salmon, which he said was moist and flavorful.  The host staff were super friendly. Very nice restaurant. Can't wait to go back and try a steak.",

A friend and I went in and had a couple of drinks and dinner, our server Ryan David was outstanding.  We have been to quite a few different locations but this one stands out by far.  The Manager, James Jackson even greeted us to make sure everything was how we expected and we told him whatever he is doing to keep it up because the attention to detail we observed from his staff was impressive!  We watched a table being set near us and the level of perfection is remarkable!  This is probably our new favorite location!  Kudos to Mr. Jackson and Mr. David for a job well done! LT from BMW",

The basket of bread arrived with butter just right softness, chilled glasses of water and a chilled Cosmo that was very good with generous alcohol.

I had the steak sliders that were done just as ordered and came with salad and some amazing fries fries.  The service was great, our waiter David, was helpful and attentive but not obtrusive.

Of course when the food was served I was informed that the chef heard of my love of the creamed corn and made it for me! This is the kind of wow experience that will make me a fan forever.

The drinks at the bar were delicious along with the bar nuts. Most people cringe at the thought of bar nuts but these are like a brittle with a small spice to them.    We then go to our table that is decorated with real rose petals and heart confetti.  For our appetizer we order the Shellfish platter which included one whole lobster which was separated for easy eating. Also there were six oysters and six shrimp. All of which were delicious.  My husband had the Sliced Filet Mignon, and I had the Gorgonzola and Truffle Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip.  We both asked for our meat to be cooked medium rare and they both came out textbook.  Both dishes were mouth watering and absolutely spectacular.  For desert we had a special anniversary plate made up for us, and was first asked if there was anything we didn't care for to which I responded coconut.  The waiter came out with a stunning plate with a chocolate espresso type cake and a to die for cheesecake that was so light, not heavy like most cheesecakes are. Also we got the Creme Brulee, my favorite, which was absolutely heaven.   Everything on their menu looked amazing and I wanted to try all of it. I look foreword to our next visit.",

I ordered the Kona crusted Delmonico on the recommendation of one of my dinner mates, and had it cooked medium.  It was a phenomenal steak.  Cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.  I'm skipping ahead though, first I had a Brussels sprout salad.  I expected it to be some kind of warm cooked salad, but the Brussels sprouts were raw.  It was actually really good, and a bit unexpected.  With the entree we ordered sides to share including Brussels sprouts, potatoes au gratin, and asparagus.  I thought the cooked Brussels sprout side needed a bit more seasoning and was slightly under cooked.  The real star was the au gratin potatoes which were delicious.  The dessert!  Truth be told, I almost never get dessert.  However, I can often be swayed with the slightest suggestion if there is either creme brulee or coconut creme pie.  Capital Grille had the coconut pie.  It was awesome.  It's quite large, you would be safe splitting it.  The wait staff was very attentive.  Overall a great experience.  I will definitely return if I'm in the area.",

Hands down the best clam chowder soup I've ever had. Next course was the filet mignon. Perfectly cooked. We saw the lobster mac and cheese on yelp and discovered it wasn't on the lunch menu. The chef made an exception and let us order it. The steaks are reasonably priced and actually come with a side unlike some other steak houses in the valley. At this point we were stuffed and skipped on dessert. They came out with complimentary dessert which was delicious. Only took a few bites and took the rest home. Will definitely be back.",

I was going to order the Butter Poached Lobster and Tenderloin most expensive item on menu at $52, but the server gave the \"Specials\" 1st and one was \"Surf & Turf\" Tenderloin and Lobster tail. Since this was what I wanted to begin with I ordered it. What a surprise when I got the bill. $90.00 just for my plate. No questions the place is upscale, food is done just right and service is great but come on $90 for \"Surf & Turf\". I guess if I had to suggest anything if you want a QUIET dinner don't go here. Wide open room with tables and some booths. If I'm going to pay this price I'm sure I can find another location, same quality, same service, same food with more ambience for the price.",

We had a wonderful surprise with a champagne toast,  along with their chocolate torte for dessert.  To die for.  My husband had never been to a Capital Grille before.  So, when I ordered the lobster mac and cheese, he was skeptical because he is a health food nut.  But, when he was wanting to eat the leftovers cold the next day,  I knew he totally loved it!  I had the filet, medium rare, cooked to perfection.  My husband had the sirloin, also cooked to perfection.  Laura was our server, and she was fantastic.  The manager greeted us at the table and made sure we were happy with our service and our meal.  I have had this treatment at every Capital Grilled location I have been to.  You cannot go wrong at this place.  Its the perfect restaurant to celebrate a special occasion.",

I also shared some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had in my life!  I pondered dinging them a star on price, but you get what you pay for.  Know going into this place that it's an expensive steakhouse.  Disclaimer: I wasn't the one paying for the meal when I dined here.  The lighting was dim, and I could see this place being very romantic for special occasions.  If you plan to stay more than the two hour limit in the pay parking, just park in the free lot or garage behind Saks and Macy's.  Or just valet it if paying a little doesn't matter to you.",

While my visits can cost a pretty penny, I've never been disappointed.  Most recently I was at TCG for a Master Wine Tasting event, which was a great deal... and it's a promotion that is taking place at dinner time now through our crazy Summer (ending September 5th).  For $25 per person, TCG offers generous pours of up to 11 wine selections.  We sampled quite a variety of vino: sparkling, red, and white, from Napa Valley, Italy, and New Zealand.  I'm no wine connoisseur, but I enjoyed them all!   And for $40 more, ($65 total), TCG does a food pairing to go with the wine selections. On the night we were there, our courses included Lobster and Crab Cake, Pan-Fried Calamari, Cedar Planked Salmon, Lamb Chop, Sirloin, and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake.  Not the healthiest meal, but it sure was a foodie experience!  My favorites were the calamari and the flourless chocolate cake.  The rest of the group I dined with enjoyed it all as well... You cannot go wrong with escaping the heat this summer and spending an evening at The Capital Grille with their special tasting menus!",

Heck when me broncos and I wanna get our stiff drinks and rare steaks, The Capital Grille gives us a.....................thrill! Robert Sedona usually dines here twice a week. The service is A+ and the valet is right out front. Some might say the menu prices are to high, but poor people shouldn't eat here anyhow. Cesar salads are the best in town. For a fossil like me, we like them dishes that were invented in the days of the Bible. The best food came outta ancient Rome, and the Capital Grille does ancient like Sam Fox does wine bars. Try the baked and cheesy appetizers. MMMMMMMMMMMMM! If y'all get there early fer yer 5 p.m. dinner reservation like I tend to do, sit at the bar and order a Martini. Makes me feel like one of them Njew Yorkers! For class atmosphere, tip top service, innovative food, strong spirits and more wood interior than a Lumber Liquidators storefront, Capital Grille is the spot. Huzzah! Great time! -RS",

Fabulous flavor with a crisp exterior and tender inside. Sirloin with coffee crusting and sirloin with gorgonzola and cabernet reduction were both great. Roasted brussel sprouts were just right, as well. Took our server's recommendation for wine and had a really good Cabernet.  The manager Dan showed us to our table and came by during the meal to ask us how things were going. It's obvious he cares deeply about the success of his restaurant. Our server Ryan David was both knowledgeable and personable.  Check for appetizer, two sirloin entrees, three glasses of wine, and one vegetable side came to just less than $200. I added a $75 tip to show our appreciation. Next time we're in town we'll make sure to visit them again.",

The food here is freaking amazing. Service is excellent.   Extensive wine list, average beer list. No hard seltzer's (hopefully they jump on that wagon, since everyone is on a White Claw/Truly kick including me), but they make a mean pineapple martini that is made in house a la jungle juice.   I had the special last time I was there: halibut with shrimp scampi and a shit ton of butter lol...OMG it was the best halibut I've ever had. The seafood is flown in fresh everyday. Shrimp cocktail was so damn fresh, no fishy smell. Our lobster Mac and Cheese was a bit skimpy with the lobster but still good. Filet mignon-like buttah and hot pink in the middle just how I like it! Truffle fries were perfectly crisp. We had the cheesecake for dessert and the whole table agreed it was the best cheesecake we'd ever had.   I've been to CG off and on throughout the years and this location feels more casual than the Scottsdale location but in a good way. Dress and ambiance was laid back, which makes for a comfortable gourmet dining experience.   Highly recommend this place if you are celebrating a special occasion or if you're just in the mood for a fancy dinner. 4.5 Stars in the realm of fine dining.",

Entrees were mistimed with one patron waiting over 10 minutes while all others in our party of 6 had been served. Steak was finished with a coffee sauce that separated and did nothing to mask the Beef's lack of flavor.  All coffee was served at room temperature and had to be returned.  The server was professional apologetic and the high point of the evening. Kudos for making a disastrous dinner an enjoyable evening out.   At these price points I expect a better experience. I prefer this location to Scottsdale so I'll give it one more try....",

    "text": "The Capital Grill 2502 E Camelback Rd Phoenix, AZ 85016  Companion and I arrived for a dinner reservation at 5:30 and were seated immediately. We were immediately brought warm bread and lavosh along with butter lightly salted on top. Drinks were ordered. Companion ordered a Pink Squirrel, which we were surprised that the bartender knew how to make. I ordered a Beefeater martini very dry with a double olive. Both libations were well made.  Companion ordered Lobster Bisque, which came out like a deep pink pool of elegance sporting nice pieces of lobster in it. Dry Sherry was nicely poured over the top as a finishing touch. I ordered a crab meat cocktail, which was adequate but nothing to brag about.  Next came main courses. Companion ordered the Porcini rubbed Bone In Ribeye, cooked rare. It arrived perfectly cooked rare, but not blue. For myself, I ordered the Broiled Lobster, which also came out cooked to perfection. It is easy to ruin a lobster by undercooking or overcooking it, but this was carefully watched. It was served with lots of melted sweet butter, which apparently all restaurants are now doing. I added my own salt to it which brought out that buttery flavor that I sought.  Side dishes were Wild Mushrooms and Creamed Spinach. The shrooms were nicely cooked, and while not necessarily wild (the same are available in most markets) nonetheless had good flavor. The creamed spinach was adequate. It lacked finishing flavor and the requisite creaminess. Perhaps they could get the recipe from Lawry's Prime Rib for there's, which is the standard yardstick for comparison.  On to dessert. This was the one area that the meal failed totally in expectation. Companion ordered Creme Brulee, which is not a difficult dessert to create. The first thing noticed was that the dish was warm. The creme was eggy and lacked vanilla. Worse, it had never properly set, and was watery. Probably as a result, the crystallized sugar top was very thin, and had no snap or crunch, which is a signature of this dish. If this is the best the pastry chef can do, perhaps its time to look for another one. For myself, I ordered vanilla ice cream with strawberries and aged balsamic vinegar on top. The \"homemade\" ice cream had an odd flavor and while I know that an aged balsamic is costly, I had to wonder if they could spare it.  Overall service was excellent and attentive. The premises were spotless and the restrooms were properly maintained with good sanitation.  With the exception of the dessert, the meal was excellent and had the dessert been up to snuff, would have been given 5 stars.  4 Stars for excellent meal except dessert, excellent service and excellent cleanliness.",

    "text": "This was our first time at the Capital Grille. My wife and I celebrated our 20 year anniversary here and it was WONDERFUL. This is the perfect \"special occasion\" place with amazing food and classy atmosphere. I made an online reservation and put in the note that it was our anniversary. When we arrived our table was set with a \"Happy Anniversary\" card, perfectly set, a long stem red rose and small decorations. It's a bit pricey but the food quality and superior service definitely make it worth it. Here's a quick recap of our meal:  Lobster Bisque: My wife loves seafood and this was a home run. This was recommended by our waiter and was delicious. The lobster was prepared perfectly and the bisque was pleasantly flavored with some spices I can't quite identify but were excellent.   Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon: I don't really like fish outside of salmon and this was delicious. The light glaze was perfect and salmon was perfectly cooked. It sat on top of glazed almonds and green beans. I cleaned the plate.   Roasted Chicken: This was very good. The tiny potatoes included were nicely flavored. If you're looking for robust flavor then order something else. It was good but didn't have as strong of flavors as some of the other dishes. No complaints as the chicken was good just an observation.    Au Gratin Potatoes: These were nicely prepared and not over-cooked. They are pretty straight forward and a decent side dish. Cold have been more cheesy but I like them drowning. Note: All but one of the side dishes can come in half-sizes. If you're just having dinner for 2 then the half-size is plenty.   Lobster Mac & Cheese: This was a smash hit with us. The waiter said many people come in and get this side dish as an entire meal. We can see why. The cheese blend was super. My wife loved the lobster included and the bread crumb toppings. We brought the rest of this home and our teenage son loved it.   Desert: We were served a complimentary dessert to celebrate our anniversary. The chocolate espresso cake was good but very, very rich. The cheesecake was light, fluffy and the raspberry puree was a nice addition. Both of these were delicious but admittedly we couldn't eat much of the chocolate piece because of its richness.   Service: This may have been one of the best servers I've ever had. Bryan was super knowledgeable about the food, the specials, the flavors, the favorites, how things are prepared, etc. He was super pleasant, appropriately humorous and was a huge positive for our dining experience. I will ask for him again the next time.   Overall: I may have to save up for a few weeks but we'll definitely be back. What a great experience and anniversary dinner. Definitely will recommend to anyone.",

Upon our arrival, we were greeting very nicely, sat at a table that had a card and happy birthday confetti! All the staff was more than accommodating and went above and beyond!!  As for the food, it was great! I got the ribeye, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach. My friend got seared tenderloins with poached lobster tails! The meat was cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes were very tasty, though the creamed spinach could have used a little more flavor.  For desert, cheesecake and chocolate molten cake! Overall, great experience and highly recommend! Thanks Rocco for excellent service!",

The service was exceptional, the food was delicious, and they made my birthday very special. I arrived to a decorated table with a hand written happy birthday card. I thought it was very personable and unique. I received complimentary champagne and an amazing dessert (chocolate lava cake with ice-cream and the cheesecake). Our waiter Rocco was the best! He consistently checked our table, recommended items, and overall made my experience one to remember. If I had to change one thing about my experience, I would select the Brussels sprouts as a side over the spinach. The spinach was good, but I have had better and many people were ordering the Brussel sprouts which made me think they were a restaurant favorite.",

    "text": "I came here after being recommended to by a friend. The place has nice music, a fancy atmosphere, attentive staff, and fantastic food.  They have a housemade grapefruit soda, which is made with a layer of elderflower syrup, grapefruit juice, and club soda. A bit sweet for my palate, but the taste is refreshing! Their freshly squeezed mint lemonade is also delicious and less sweet than the grapefruit soda.  I came here for lunch and ordered their oscar salmon with lobster bisque. The lobster bisque has actual lobster piece in a rich broth with a creamy consistency. The waitress asked if we want some dry sherry drizzled on top to enhance the flavor and some black pepper. I opted for both and it was even more flavorful. I didn't even know that was possible!  I received excellent service here from Randee Porter (the waitresses have business cards here!). She was very knowledgeable about her drinks and food on menu, and extremely patient and attentive to us.  We got fresh bread with butter when we were seated. It's great to have soft, fluffy rolls to eat with our food, smeared with softened butter.  My entree arrived shortly after. The oscar salmon came with jumbo crab meat on top in a Bearnaise sauce and grilled asparagus beneath. The salmon was tender and moist with the drizzled sauce on top. I think that the Bearnaise was slightly too salty for my palate and the asparagus was rather charred to where there was a slightly bitter taste to it. I enjoyed the crab meat on top and thought this was an overall solid dish.  MY SO ordered the dry aged rib eye with green beans. He likes his rib eye medium rare and it was slightly overcooked. The staff offered to get him a new one cooked to perfection, but we thought it would be a waste to change out an entire new steak so we were fine with it. The green beans that it came with was perfect--there was a nice crunch from the green beans, paired with the sweetness of the tomatoes, onions, and garlic. It was so good that my SO wanted to lick the bowl that it came in haha. That was the highlight of his meal!  Overall, this place has nice music, fancy atmosphere, and great staff. I think it deserves a solid 4.5 stars.",

It's in the Biltmore and you can either get the valet parking adjacent to the restaurant, or you can opt for the lot across the street which will be validated if you eat here.  The waiter was the best.  He was charming, funny, personable, and went out on a limb to recommend his favorite dishes.  He answered all of our questions promptly and with a smile.    I cannot remember a meal I've had that was this good.  We each had the wedge salad, perfectly cut iceberg lettuce with a bit of bleu cheese, steaks, and dessert.  The meal just kept getting better and better as the courses progressed.  The kona coffee rub made the trip down to Biltmore worth and and I still salivate thinking about it.    If you are in the area and are willing to spend a few extra bucks on dinner, this is the place.",

After a long time waiting for our Stoli-Doli's, which are awesome Martini's, our waiter returned with out them not realizing we had ordered them and then he was gone quite a while again to take our orders. By then we had gone through an entire basket of delicious bread. My husband and I shared the tomato mozzarella salad which was very good and different than your usual caprese salad, great 15 year old balsamic dressing. My husband had the dry-aged NY strip, medium rare and cooked perfectly. One of our friends had the Wagu Beef burger which he totally enjoyed and our other friend had shrimp cocktail that had several huge jumbo shrimp and she also had the lobster mac-n-cheese which she said was amazing. I ordered the beef tenderloin with lobster which I was sorry I ordered, the beef tenderloin was 2 very small pieces of filet cooked a perfect medium rare and 2 very large shrimp sized lobster tails that were a little dry and tough. I also wasn't expecting it to be on top of a white sauce. It was tasty but I would have enjoyed it better with just a clarified butter on the side. My husband and I shared a side of the brussel sprouts which are absolutely delicious and for me was the best part of the meal. We ordered creme brulee which was good, topped with a little fresh fruit and was light.",

Centrally located in the heart of the city in the Biltmore, this burger joint is unlike any other.   Once you step foot into Capital Grill you already know that you are in beautiful decorated, and elegant establishment. The customer service is great starting with the greeter at the door, and the attentive waiters/waitresses staff. I constantly had my glass filled, as well as had a great breakdown of the beef (where it is from, what makes it so great, etc.) Additionally, the wines offered are smooth and vary in style but can be sampled.   The wine/burger combo is definitely a great promotion when available. Capital Grille is definitely great for a date night out, business meeting, or pretty much just for a great burger! Definitely one of the best burgers I have had to date.",

We were seated at a secluded booth with an anniversary card and heart confetti on the table.   We started with the signature calamari, always a favorite. My husband enjoyed the classic Caesar salad with shaved Parmesan and crunchy croutons while I enjoyed the spinach salad with large pieces of bacon, feta, mushrooms and purple onions. At Robbie, our waiters recommendation, I ordered the special, a 16 ounce bone in filet. I have never seen this on a menu before. WOW! It was superb. We finished the evening with a cappuccino and an anniversary dessert plate. We recommend The Capital Grille for any special occasion.  We will be back again soon.",

Turned out BEST decsion.  We were given professional & informative tastings of wines from Napa & South Africa.    Although this was a fun, different and good little event, and we really enjoyed it, it was NO where near as great an experience that we had at the CG in North Scottsdale 2 weeks earlier, ie: NITE and DAY difference.  (pours were half the size, and they were extremely hesitant, if at all, to give another taste of 1 which u may have liked....  I WOULD go back to N.

    "text": "While one of the best steaks I have ever eaten was in a cowboy bar outside of Dallas where there were more teeth on the floor than in the average patron's mouth. I have come to believe that most of us generally desire that unique union of a robust menu composed of carefully planned and executed dishes with a splash of unique drinks, a dazzling wine selection, excellent service that offer suggestions to round out a dining experience, and finally an atmosphere that lets us focus on our palette not our survival instincts. If your generally in agreement with me then the Capital Grille is right up your prospective alley and will definitely set the bar higher.   While the steaks are absolutely excellent, they take a great amount of pride and care in the preparation of everything. Starting with the appetizers, the oyster and shellfish platters were well done and exceptionally fresh especially when you consider we are in the middle of the desert. The Kona Sirlon was cooked to absolute perfection and the rub composed of coffee and other seasonings gave you all the more reason to linger over every bite. The dinner service was absolutely perfect, he remained observant and ensured we were taken care of without being obtrusive seemingly allowing us to dine from the horn of plenty.",

This fine dining restaurant definitely gets two thumbs up!  Though there was no gluten-free pasta, brown rice, or quinoa, there were other wonderful options to still satisfy my strict dietary needs.

Not a moment went by without our glasses filled or a finished plate cleared.   I had an amazing steak- of course- which I do not eat often because once you have it at a place like this, it is hard to imagine trying to duplicate. I put the creamed spinich on top and it was amazing. I also sampled the lobster mac and cheese which tempted me to lick the plate and also the lobster bisque. WOW. Seriously, everything knocked my pants off.  It seemed like all hands on deck kept the night smooth and us feeling taken care of. Outstanding service is so rare, and I must compliment the team there for being friendly- not snotty or unapproachable- and very attentive.

    "text": "Fine Dining is hard to find and Capital Grill ranks right up there. It's my favorite spot for a great steak and large selection of wines. I judge a steakhouse by trying the Rib-Eye. Capital Grill only serves \"Prime\" and yes, you do pay the price. This is not a \"cheap date\", and has become one of special occasion spots...anniversary, birthday etc.   The Rib-Eye here has the perfect marbleization and has always been cooked to perfection. Sandra K usually has the Filet, and has never been disappointed.  But I better mention the Lobster Bisque soup before detailing the steaks and sides. It is like a special sunset. Dazzling light, luminescent colors and a special moment. Not sure how's it's made...but to die for flavor. Salads are exceptional, except I usually go for the soup, but when I'm thinking healthy, I have the wedge or Caesar, or on occasion the bacon spinach. All worth mentioning.  Back to the steaks, again, I am a Rib-Eye fan but I have had The Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre with a Courvasier Cream Sauce. This steak is rubbed with crushed peppercorns and \"seared\" to lock in the juices. The cream sauce is such a delight. Don't mix the Lobster Bisque and this steak unless you want a decadent evening.   By the way, don't lke beef? Try the Double Cut Lambchops...fabulous! Seafood, I can't get myself to order seafood at a Steak House, unless I have Steak and Lobster/Crab. Then again, I get my Lobster fix with the soup or the appetizers.  Sides....This is why I like to take a group here. The sides are all \"shareable\" although there are several here that I don't want my companions to take too much. Parmesan Truffle Fries....ouch on the flavor scale (and other scales). Lobster and Mac N Cheese, again, I get my seafood on the side, this one is decadent to the power of 10 and one of my all time favorites are the AuGratin potatoes. To impress my guests, I will order a vegetable to share and it's usually the creamed spinach or asparagus. But sliding into decadence here means I throw out the rules of engagement and if I going to sin....here I am going to sin big, and that means dessert as well.  Coconut Cream Pie or Key Lime Pie at a fine dining spot contrast the other offerings of Flourless Chocolate Expresso Cake and Berries and Cream. Go for it.  I have had intimate dining here with Sandra K and most recently, hosted a luncheon for 60 persons in a private setting. Service has always been impeccable and the food is distinguished.",

We asked to be moved but were told that the other tables in the restaurant were reserved even though we had a reservation as well. Nobody came in the entire time we were there either so I personally felt like they didn't think we would spend money because we were dressed casually so they put us at a bad table even though we did not cheap out on any of our orders and left a good tip.  3 stars for judging people when you shouldn't.",

It was a business lunch, but I couldn't help but admire the wine list and imagine coming back here for dinner sometime. It would make a really great date place, especially if you splurged on the valet out front. After all, it is the Biltmore. And, let's face it, even I like getting dolled up every once in a while.   Back to lunch. I sampled the jumbo shrimp in the shrimp sauce, along with some really perfectly breaded calamari, which was the best calamari my lips have ever come across. I ordered the crab/lobster burger, which was presented as a seafood mix between a whole grain bun. Every bite was better than the last. I delightfully ate the entire thing.   Then, it was time for dessert. I chose the flour-less espresso cake. Unbelievable. It was so thick and rich, though, that I left half behind. Then again, who really needs to eat the entire piece? Granted, it was packed with so much sugar, I immediately began to droop into a mid-afternoon coma. But, I didn't care. I just had one of the best lunches of my entire life.   Sometimes I remember that lunch and I shake my head. Never mind it was for business. Never mind I didn't have any wine. Never mind I had to go back to work after wards. I still rate that lunch and this restaurant at 5 stars. Imagine how wonderful this could be if you order a glass of wine and go for a special occasion with a special someone. Wow. Talk about needing more stars for that!",

    "text": "After an unpleasant experience at the Scottsdale store, we decided to try this store this week. We were glad we did. The place seemed to be as busy as the Scottsdale store was 7 days ago, including successive groups in the meeting room. Although it was hectic, staff seemed to have everything under control. The 601 was good, of course. The wine list was different but had good choices and our waitress Shay had good suggestions. She was very attentive and bus service was constant, management pitched in and other waiters kept track when she wasn't right there. What matters to us is service: lots of places have good food but when good service is lacking, we wonder what we pay for. The Cobb salad was good: Shay recommended a different preparation and while I couldn't see the difference, I appreciated the suggestion. The steak sandwich my wife had was good. My wife had berries with cream: nothing was wrong this week. We had the kind of experience we expect from Capital Grille that we missed at the Scottsdale store last week.",

We had a table with red hearts and a nice anniversary card from Capital Grille. Our server, Ryan David, was exceptional. I know he had other tables but we felt like he was there just for us. The food was delicious. The shrimp cocktail was great and you must try the calamari. Yum! The steaks were juicy and flavorful. The lobster mac and cheese was decadent. I could eat it every day and still want more. We had a wine tasting special at our table. It was fun to see if we could guess what kind each was. The whites were easier than the reds. We had a complimentary dessert duo; cheesecake and something rich & chocolate. The cheesecake was my favorite. I love food and am not easily impressed but I was impressed with my meal. From beginning to end we thoroughly enjoyed every moment. Don Goodwin, the manager, came by our table to see if we were pleased with everything. We were. It was our first visit but it will not be our last. Please dine here at least once. You will be glad you did.",

Voor 2 hoofdgerechten en 2 glazen wijn mochten we inclusief fooi 150 dollar afrekenen. En om nou te zeggen dat je er iets bijzonders voor terug kreeg; niet echt dus. De irritant opdringerige ober wist de gerechten wel bijzonder te laten klinken, maar het was uiteindelijk niks meer dan een matige steak met gesmolten blauwe kaas en een boel gefrituurde uien er boven op. Tenzij je heel erg graag veel geld betaald in een zaak die meer aandacht heeft voor het interieur dan voor het eten, zou ik doorlopen naar Seasons 52 waar je beide krijgt.",

By the time we got our drinks, our table was ready. The service was great. We started with smoked salmon as an appetizer, which we enjoyed. The lobster bisque was delicious. It took a long time for our entrees to come out. I understand the kitchen was probably slammed because of Valentine's Day, but other tables were getting their entrees much faster than we were. One steak was over cooked (ordered medium rare plus and delivered closer to medium well) and the other was under cooked (ordered medium rare plus and delivered medium rare to rare). The only flavor the steak had was the char on the outside, and I was disappointed to learn that their steaks aren't even prime! They are choice steaks! We added a lobster tale on the side which was good but a bit over cooked. The lobster Mac and cheese was great.",

But all the sides are excellent.  As for the steak itself....they are great.  The bone-in Kona crusted is my personal favorite, however, you really cant go wrong with any of the suggestions.  The service is exactly what you would expect from this type of a restaurant.  I only give this 4 stars, as I had to wait for about 20 minutes for a table, even though I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance.  Also, the table they eventually sat us at had no one sitting at it for the 20 minutes that we waited.  If it was not for this, it would be 5 stars.  Also, a bit pricey, but it is relative to any other steak house.  Creme brulee was also very good.",

Will be a go to date night place for sure.   5 Star - Service -  As good as I've had anywhere I've been. Maybe better. Which in Arizona might make it 6 star service considering the norms here.    5 Star - Atomosphere - Beautiful old school decor. A real \"white table cloth\" kind of place. Warm and inviting, quiet and comfortable.   4 Star - Food - Better than anything I've had in Arizona but not as good as several meals I've had in Portland/NYC/San Diego etc...So can't give it 5 stars. It's good, but for the price it should be AS GOOD as anything anywhere. Therefore the overall 4 star instead of 5 rating.   Wine list - I'm not great at evaluating wine lists compared to a True wineologist (you know what i mean). I only care if they have what I like and they do. So 5 star wine for me.   Can't say enough about the service though. Really really wonderful at every level.",

My fiance and I were so impressed with the quality of the food and drink as well as the hospitality shown by the staff. We enjoyed their signature drink, the Stoli Doli, which is vodka infused with fresh pineapple and served straight up. It was excellent! We also were treated to a variety of appetizers such as shrimp cocktail and risotto balls. The shrimp were huge and so fresh and don't even get me started on how delicious the risotto balls were. The best part was there was a raffle for a $100 gift certificate and I won! So we are very much looking forward to returning for lunch or dinner and trying some more selections off the menu. This is very much a special occasion kind of place. Not the kind of place we would be able to frequent often on our budget, but definitely the kind of place we would chose to celebrate a birthday or other special occasion. We are so grateful for the hospitality the Capital Grill showed to us and our neighbors and can't wait to return!",

He treated us like long lost friends.  His long fingers and long hands expertly delivered our plates (and his fingers never touched to top of our plates...we look for that). He took our photo with the fabulous desert plate before we devoured everything on it!  Best deserts I've had in a long time (Coconut Cream Pie, Chocolate Cake and, my favorite, Cheesecake). But besides the service and desert, let me praise the beef! All four of us ordered Filet Mignon (one Filet Oscar) and all of us thought it was a prime cut of meat!  The au gratin potatoes (which I haven't eaten in years) was hot, cheesy and wonderful!  Capital Grille ranks up there with Morton's in my book for sure!

    "text": "I took my boyfriend here for his 4th of July birthday (dinner on the 3rd). Capital Grille was my second choice -- my first choice was closed for the holiday weekend. And am I ever so glad it was.  When making a reservation I dropped that it was a birthday dinner. Upon checking in, the hostess immediately wished him a happy birthday by name and took us to a table adorned with a tasteful amount of birthday confetti and a card signed by the staff. Nice!  From there on out the service, food and ambiance was outstanding. It far exceeded my expectations from all the wonderful reviews I had read previously. Our waiter, Chad, was very helpful in helping us select items as we were a little overwhelmed by all the good reviews on yelp and the things people have told us personally. Drinks - a gin and tonic for him and a Stoli Doli for me. Appetizer was calamari, which was delicious. He got the 24 ounce porterhouse, which he ate every bit of. I had the bone-in kona crusted sirloin - AMAZING. A cup of lobster bisque is mandatory. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was an interesting grown-up take on the kid friendly dish. Not as creamy as the microwavable stuff, a little on the soupy side but it was definitely working. We got a creme brulee for dessert, which I discovered upon receiving the check that they comped it for the birthday.  The service is very well worth noting. I'm not big on fluff and getting my rear kissed as a customer, and the service exceeded standard customer service with genuine sincerity without flirting with that rear-kissing fakeness. Although I suspect if you are of that type that appreciates that, they'll do that too. The type of place that folds your napkin whenever you leave the table to use the restroom, but doesn't over-sir or over-madam you. My boyfriend and I are $2 pitcher, jeans and flip flop type diners but the service was welcoming and even though we were out of our usual element, we didn't feel like it.  I even got a follow-up phone call the next day asking how our dinner was!   My facebook status update right after dinner: \"I will be thinking about this meal for weeks.\"",

From the perfectly cooked filet mignons, to the incredibly fresh shrimp cocktail, to the creamy and utterly delicious mashed potatoes with the right amount of lumpiness... it was 5* worthy.

Our server, an older gent who still had spring in his step, was kept so busy by his other tables at different corners of the restaurant, left us neglected for more than 25 minutes between service of the appetizers and checking in to see if we had finished. We had, and we'd finished our waters and sodas as well.   To the chefs at The Capital Grille... well done! To the waitstaff... sigh... just... sigh.",

Salmon that is farm raise(Atlantic). The steak that is almost tasteless. Veggies that are plain but buttery. The server was kind of racist (only asked what my white friend wants to drink, didn't ask me, and then brings me water). The only good thing about this place is the interior itself. The dinner alone was 83 dollars(split amount 3 people). If you have friends that want to get you there please steer them away because both of your stomach and wallet will leave unsatisfied.",

We were a party of 5 and choose Lobster Bisque, Calamari, Fishcakes and Wedge Salad to begin. 3 of the party had steak and it was wonderful. I had the tuna. It was cooked to perfection seared on the outside and rare inside. So tender and delicious. The selection of wines are excellent and we started with the Riesling and continued with red. It is pricey. It is an expensive night out but if watching the cents is the least of your problems then you are in for a treat. Definitely a safe bet for any food snob or connoisseur!",

I ordered the \"Cobb\" Salad & oh my goodness, it was seriously fabulous. The mustard dressing was so light and perfect. The steak was cooked to perfection, you could literally cut it with a fork.

However last night I had the opportunity to attend a Yelp event here and I love it even more.  We received a 'meat education' and it was very enlightening.  It's one thing to go and chow down on their delicious cuts of meat, but now I'm more familiar with the types of meat and the aging proces.  I know the difference between dry and wet aged meat.  How epicurean of me.    I know the difference between a porterhouse and a t bone now.  Oh my.    I also know the difference between prime and choice cuts of meat.  Check me out!  Not only did we get to learn about their meats, we got to sample.  I ve been to alot of these, but never have I been able to eat a ton of different meats at once . I\"m not made of money. Last night I got to.  I also won a $50 gift card for the above knowledge.  So yeah, I love them even more.  However I was pleased to also find out that they donate a ton of food to a local charity that feeds homeless individuals.  Working with a church that offers temporary housing for those that are transitioning from homelessneess, they provide enough food for 2 meals a day.  Wow.  I was also thrilled to learn about their $16 lunch deals.  So I can eat TWICE their for free on my gift card.  Boom, done.",

The service was spotty, my club soda was not refilled and the entrees were disappointing.  My husband and I ordered the Lamb Chops, a favorite of ours.  I ordered rare and it was raw.  My husband had medium rare and his was medium well.  We had several sides and my husband burned his hand on the potatoes.  If the dishes are too hot to pass then they should be served.  After he burned his hand the server served the other diners.  Overall a very dissapointing dinner.",

It is safe to assume that everything was an exemplary five star experience.  Was with a group, so we all ordered the signature Stoli Doli martini which was shaken so well that there was slight frost crystals floating on the top.  Great balance of Stoli and pineapple.  We all loved them!  Bread basket came out with pumpernickel and raisin, cheese onion and of course the lavash.    We all shared so the lamb medium rare excellent as well as the tuna served with 4 different sauces.  Perfect rare sear with the sauces some being spicy, one being soy and two others that unfortunately I didn't get to try do to my compatriots pounding the tune :)  Now of course one has to have the dessert.  So three were ordered-  first the flour less chocolate cake, always so phenomenal, especially if you like dark chocolate that isn't over sweetened.  The second dessert was the coconut cream pie that was remarkably good and lastly the cheesecake with berry side.  Instead of describing them in detail its sufficient to say less  than three minutes not one damn crumb remained of anything.  Service was A+ and made sure we were well taken care of.",

While the presentation was nice and the whip cream very tasty there was way more whip creme then there should have been for the size of the pie. The actual pie portion was about 5 inches round and the filling about 1 inch thick. However the whip creme was about 4 inches high. While the presentation was nice the ratio was all off and it ended up being a whip creme pie. I can appreciate that the chef wanted to make the dessert his own this was a miss in my opinion. The service was great for the most part although getting the check did take some time.",

Always have to try lobster Mac n' cheese wherever I go....this was very good too. Its good to share with a friend or two. The flourless espresso cake was also very yummy. It is dark chocolate and heavenly. Creme Brulee was classy and done right. Cocktails were also awesome. Bohemian was sweet and bubbly. Capital cosmo hit the right spot and the French 75 was also very pleasing. Thanks for the champagne, Brandon.",

I had dined there a couple of times in the past but it was just special this time.  Our server Shay was outstanding. She introduced herself and immediately I knew she was going to be great. Very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Part of what made her so great was that she shared her passion for food and cooking. Anyone can be a good server, but it takes someone like Shay with her passion to be a great server, especially in a high end restaurant.   Moving on to the food.... Shay recommended the lunch size filet with prawn scampi. Served with a choice of side, I picked the mashed potatoes.   This meal was just perfect in every way. A nice size filet and four large prawns on top. There aren't words to describe how good the scampi sauce was...garlic, butter and actually a little spicy. The mashed potatoes could not have been better, seasoned just right and made with butter and cream. I am excited just writing about it and I can't wait to go back!  Everyone in my party had the same thing and we all agreed how great this meal was.   So...Want a recommendation? Try the fillet and prawn scampi next time you are at The Capital Grill. They do it for lunch and dinner with a larger filet served for the dinner.   Enjoy!",

Main course was gorgonzola crusted NY strip.  The steak was very good, but the gorgonzola was not crusted.  It was basically a slice of cheese laid across the steak and melted.  I scrapped most of it off.  But the au gratin potatoes were superb. If you go there for a drink, the potatoes and wrapped mozzarella will fill you up and make you happy.  Dessert was coconut cream pie.  OMG!  That's all I can say!!!",

They made sure that we had refreshments while we were decorating. They served our meal efficiently and promptly. They cleared away the service items at the end of the meal so that we could enjoy the celebration cake together, which they prepared by the way. It was a memorable evening and my dad had a wonderful time. Thanks so much to the team at Capital Grill.",

The au gratin potatoes looked like they were not going to be good, but were awesome. The asparagus was burnt on the tips, which kinda ruined that portion.

When I asked my waiter (Daniel) for a 3rd drink, he replied that I would have to pay, because the dinner party was set for 2 drink max per person. This was unbelievable because many of my co workers were on their 3rd & 4th drink. No one told them to pay I repeat No one was asked to pay for there 3rd or 4th drink. Why was I they only person told to pay $100 for a glass of wine? They only dark skin women in the entire room. I spoke with the general manager (Brian Schwartztruber) to express my feeling of profiling,  who's response to me was that his waiter is incapable of racial profiling because \"Daniel is an immigrant too\". That comment alone was racist. I had asked another coworker to corroborate my story, but she was too inebriated from her multiple free drinks to give an appropriate answer. I didn't want to cause a scene by ostracize anyone else so I quickly and quietly removed myself from the party. I WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN. I'm highly disappointed that I can't comment on the food.",

In comparison to Morton's, Steak 44, and other steakhouses in the same price range, this one REALLY lacked in quality. For the same price, I know that I could get a spectacular meal elsewhere.   The only thing I really liked about here was the assorted bread basket that they give you. I ordered a medium New York with shallot butter. The meat was tough and my steak was medium well. We also ordered scalloped potatoes and brussels sprouts, which were decent and actually pretty cheap. There was nothing special about the food, and I felt that it lacked flavor (especially my steak).   As for the ambiance, it's a little like Morton's but I absolute ABHOR the ugly jackets worn by the wait staff. It seriously makes this place look so tacky and cheap. The jackets (if you've never seen them) are like tan/khaki and loose-fitting. Seriously I could not get over how unappealing these jackets were for my entire meal. Service was okay, not great like you would expect elsewhere.  All in all, nothing went awfully wrong but I was definitely NOT happy leaving this place on Valentine's Day when I expect food and service that is actually good. Instead I got below mediocre for a fat price tag.",

    "text": "Despite being a chain, The Capital Grille breaks the formula of \"tired steakhouse\", and led to one of my favorite dining experiences I've ever had, though I have a few reservations, but I'll get those in a moment.   First off, getting in was extremely easy, but it was a Monday night. Last minute anniversary idea totally worked in our favor, as we were greeted with a \"Happy anniversary!\", and led to a seemingly huge booth decorated with rose petals & cheap plastic heart pieces, which was a nice touch.   The drink selection consisted of standards like martini's and a massive wine list. We went for the basic. Dry gin martini, 3 olives. They pulled it off wonderfully, and it was shaken/poured tableside, as it should be.  We started with the calamari. They fry them up in a bready, salty batter. Almost too salty. Then, they do something awesome, and toss in chopped cherry peppers. The result is this concoction of spicy bready perfectly fried calamari. The peppers add this crazy flavor to the overall dish, which is completely unexpected and delicious. Great ratio of head vs body too. I hate it when restaurants just give me heads. I'm not afraid of tentacles!   I had the sliced filet migon with cippolini onions and wild mushrooms, finished with a 12 year balsamiq reduction. Perfect crust on the steak. The saltyness of the crust brought out the juices of the meat, when combined with the reduction, resulted in a fantastic melt-in-the mouth feel.  That being said, I wish it was a little more rare.  She had the special, which was a lamb roulade filled with an herb cream cheese and wrapped in bacon. While this proved to be a winning combination of flavors, the lamb was slightly overcooked from medium rare.   We got the lobster mac and cheese, which had huge chunks of lobster. The cheese was mascarpone, which resulted in a soupier mac, but it worked well with the lobster. We also got the french green beans with heirloom tomatoes, which while tasty, wasn't anything special.   For dessert, we were brought an espresso chocolate flourless cake, finished with raspberry sauce & fresh raspberries. Rich and delicious.  In the end, it was a fantastic meal. The Capital Grille is not the best steakhouse I've ever been to though, it is a very close second. I recommend in a heartbeat.  As a p.s: The service was top notch. I even got a phone call the next day, wanting to know how the experience was. I have never gotten that kind of attention from a restaurant before, and I doubt it will happen again.",

I can't even count the amount of times that the staff wanted to make sure that I was taken care of (even though I was clearly helping photograph the event). Every employee seemed to have woken up on the right side of their beds today.   Service aside, the food was wonderful and came out in fresh batches. I have three favorites...the tenderloin slider, the crab slider, and the coconut cream pie bites. To be absolutely redundant, the tenderloin slider was beautifully tender. It was almost like biting into butter (but not really...that's gross), and for a slider, had a generous helping of meat on it. The crab & lobster sliders were also delicious. They were salty, and buttery with a great slightly crunchy bun. It seemed like the bun was just slightly toasted so it added just a little bit of texture. Wrapping up my favorites were the dangerously tasty pie bites. I could have eaten a whole tray of them. They were definitely some of the better coconut pie creations that I've had.  Capital Grill is among the most generous of hosts for an Elite event. Thank you as always to every person involved. Also, it was great getting to see all of the Eiltes today. I had a good time chatting with a few of you, and I can't wait to see you soon!  ***Flickr Pics***  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fyelp%2Fsets%2F72157629092996001%2F&s=1efc3194d502f86d68e60a1a2129f71060e06c56422914d21680bffc48da5111\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">flickr.com/photos/yelp/s...</a>",

My better half and I enjoyed Crab Cake Sliders, Mini Tenderloin Sandwiches, JUMBO shrimp cocktail and wayyyyyyy to many little Coconut Cream pies. Those little pie babies were like heroin...and not that nasty black tar shit either, the good stuff.   It was nice to see the sweet as pie Gabi M., looking absolutely smashing for just having a baby by the way. Actually, she looked like a person that didn't just have a baby so kudos woman!!  The staff and service was outstanding. We had quite a few conversations with the staff  and Sommelier regarding the wine menu and events and they were all knowledgeable and incredibly polite without being obnoxiously formal. It appears that they have a good read on their clientele and that's a plus in my book. All class, no sass. This experience will definitely bring us back to The Capital Grille for drinks, lunch or dinner.   Had a blast  and I look forward to the next event!",

    "text": "Ok, I am totally breaking some of my general Yelp rules here...but I have to, because this place was so good. I generally don't give 5 stars on a first visit and I also don't generally give 5 stars to a chain restaurant, but this place really blew me away. The BF and I went here last night for Restaurant Week. We had actually just gotten our reservation because we had a res somewhere else but then had to be out til after the other place closed....lucky I guess. So anyway, we get there and there is complimentary valet (which I generally find annoying, but was nice last night because we were running late). We came into the restaurant and immediately felt welcome, everyone was very friendly. We were seated right away and our waitress, Sarah, came by to explain the menu. She was super friendly and helpful and really on top of things, so that was nice.   Ok, the food: After being seated, they bring out an assortment of warm breads with softened butter. And I mean a real assortment: cracker type bread, a roll that looks like an everything bagel, delicious onion bread, and a wheat bread with raisins or some kind of fruit in it....each bread was delicious (take that Atkins!). The BF ordered a Manhattan ($11.50) and said it was 'damn good' and he is a regular Manhattan drinker, so I gotta believe it. So start, I had the french onion soup (on Sarah's recommendation) and the BF had the field greens. The soup was SO good. I generally am not a huge fan of french onion soup because it has a weird texture, but this one was full of flavor and had a ton of cheese on it. I literally was peeling cheese off the side of the bowl and eating it (I know, not so cool in a fancy restaurant...but it was so tasty!). The field green salad was light, with a flavorful, but subtle vinaigrette. It had several types of tomatoes on it, which the BF loved. For mains I had the filet mignon and the BF had the kona sirloin. They came with a little share plate of mashed potatoes and green beans. The sirloin was delicious...it had this amazing sauce on it (don't know what it was, but it has some great caramelized onions in it) and was cooked perfectly. The filet was equally good, it was simple, but cooked to perfection, it was melt in your mouth and had the perfect steak texture (no fat, gristle, anything weird feeling). I will say, the filet was even better with a little of the sauce from the sirloin, but I understand why the serve it the way they do (steak purists and all....). The mashed potatoes were divine. They were some of the most creamy, buttery mashed potatoes I have had. I wanted to lick the plate. The green beans were also delicious, very well seasoned and served with onions....yum! Now on to dessert- We shared the creme brulee and the chocolate espresso cake. Both were amazing.... When I had my first bite of the chocolate cake it was like the most intense chocolate explosion in my mouth. The espresso just adds to the intensity. I will say this, this is a dessert to be shared...it truly is too chocolatey (and large) for one person....and I love chocolate. The creme brulee was equally amazing, it was creamy with just a hint of crunch, but the most impressive part (to me anyway) was it had blackberries on it that had no seeds. What?!?! Where do I get these blackberries? They were phenomenal!   At the end of the meal, Sarah went outside and had the valet bring our car around before we even left so we didn't have to wait....ummm, seriously awesome service.   So, overall, the meal was excellent. I probably ate about 3000 calories....sorry thighs....but if I got to choose a place to destroy my diet, this would be it. The restaurant week deal was amazing too because my steak alone was 41$, but the whole meal was 30$ on special. Insanity. I would definitely come back again.",

    "text": "Always a great time at these Elite events.   Would you say I am Yelp Elite cheerleader, a proponent of local to local connection, an ambassador to the savory styles of the unconventional dining?. uhhh Yes!  A lot of the time at any Elite event there is going to be certain things that are just implicit and expected. That being: raffles,  tasty food paired with great service, a great atmosphere of a business strutting its flare and Lindsey F.   All things necessary to foster a genuine hype in the yelp food community.  I can tell a great amount of effort and thought are placed into these events, but at the same time there is an essential arbitrary yet conciliatory uniqueness. This was sufficient, and served to conciliate the good will of the foody natives, with whom the congeniality of sentiment at certain points did more towards inspiring a friendly feeling than anything else that could have happened.   Basically, odds are you will find lik minded people (Julia T. and Maggie F.). It is those moments which make Yelp and all other community based companies strive. Flood the niche.  Thanks to CG and Yelp!  R\\_",

The Capital Grille staff was amazingly friendly, supper accommodating, and really just top notch. The food was so so good.   The tenderloin sliders?!  Are you kidding me,  I couldn't pass them up every time a tray came around I was snatching one up.  And they came around often.  We were fed well at this event. I think my husband had around 17 of the tiny coconut creme pies, I don't blame him.   And since I lost rock paper scissor and got stuck with DD duties for the night, I really appreciated the nonalcoholic options, the grapefruit soda was great.   But it was hard to stay away from their signature drinks they were serving up.    Great event!  Thanks Yelp!  Thanks Lindsey! And Thanks Capital Grille!",

    "text": "I've always noticed the Capital Grille when I went to Biltmore, but thanks to last month's yelp event I finally got a chance to try out some menu items and I've been back twice this month.   It's the kind of place that you want reservations for, but we made a spur of the moment decision on a Friday night and got lucky enough to find a spot to at the bar. The wine menu is extensive, as you would expect it to be for the prices/quality of food. The steak portions are large and the Kona crusted sirloin we ordered was plenty for two (the kitchen split it for us). It was perfectly medium rare. The bread basket and sides were both good, but not the main reason you'd want to come.  Yesterday we went back to try the lunch plates menu and sat in the restaurant area. The service here was spot-on and we were in and out in an hour. Both the burger and mini tenderloin were great choices.  The ricotta cheesecake was a delicious, albeit overfilling, finishing touch.  There's a slight men's-club feeling to the place and I wouldn't describe it as trendy, but I'd have no problems going back for a solid steak.",

The staff was the epitome of \"professional,\" friendly and attentive. The decor is upscale, yet inviting. Most importantly, the food  was outstanding in every way. It was one of those times where you take a few extra bites past \"full\" because the flavor is THAT good.  Highlights: check out the Calamari appetizer, the Tenderloin Sliders, the Truffle Fries, and the Stoli Doli.  If there's one drawback to Capital Grille, it's the prices. This place is expensive. Still, if you go in knowing this in advance, you won't have anything else to gripe about. Capital Grille will take good care of you. I can't wait to return.",

The staff had showered the table with little happy birthday decorations. Thought it was a nice touch. Above and beyond that, The waitstaff was extremely professional and timely. There was always someone to refill my glass of water whenever it was halfway low. The recommendations from the server were on point, and I think we only waited about 15 minutes from the point of ordering till our food arrived at our table. The glazed salmon was amazing, and although you must order sides al a carte, the portions are pretty large. The restaurant general manager came over to wish me a happy birthday, and at the end of the night the server offered to take a group picture for us. I genuinely have nothing negative to say about this dining experience! Service was amazing, food was delicious, and the restaurant inside is beautiful.",

    "text": "Went for 3rd year anniversary with my husband.  Had a 5:00 reservation.  Arrived about 10 minutes early and we were greeted by young hostesses with heavy make-up and just okay.  We were happy to sit in the beautiful bar (entire place is decorated wonderfully - music was upbeat, young and pretty loud).  Cops was on in the bar.  Our tender was fun.  Ordered martinis straight up, with GREAT blue cheese olives.  Good service at bar.  Got served some cold bread in a basket.  Nice variety.  But cold!  We sat there for over 20 minutes though.  Wished to be seated at table on time.  Table was nice.  Servers and bussers do shuffle around and don't seem happy.  Our server was fine.  We dine at Ruth's a lot so we were happy to try a bone-in rib-eye here.  We were told that we'd find the steaks at PCG better.  Didn't turn out that way and not just because of overdone.   Another bread basket but this time it was hot.  Love the pretzle bread with big salt crystals.    Interesting that we didn't even open the menu.  What the server sugggested was what my hus. decided sounded great.  I agreed.  Nice red wine.  Lobster bisque came out pretty fast.  It was tepid.  Yuck!  Flavor was nice, lobster morsles good.  Temperature - awful!  The giant crouton it came with (same kind as bread basket) made it better.  Not enough flavor.  Just seemed to be creamy for creamy's sake.  Just a bowl of heavy cream.  Heirloom tomato salad was good but the dressing was just alright.  Nice variety of tomatoes.  Was hoping for more pizazz.    Potato Au Gratin were heavily salted.  Sliced thinkly, good texture, but I like the simplicity of Ruth's potatoes better.  They were very tasty, but maybe just a little too salty.  I like to salt my own.  Neat, but not necessay to have an extra server scoop out a serving of potatoes.  No personality when doing it.    Our steaks were ordered meduim-rare.  They came out meduim.  The server asked, noticed, took out flashlight and agreed that they were both overdone.  My hus. kept his.  Hungry is his name (not really).  My new one came out pretty fast.  With my new one, came manager.  Man, was he stuffy!  He had his flashlight too and said for me to cut into it so that HE could be sure that I'd be happy with this one.  Well, it was rare, but I, too was hungry so I kept it.  I was happy to warm it up later in the broiler and then it'd be perfect.    The meat itself was great.  Not salted or peppered at all.  Not much butter.  I love Ruth's WAY better.  I like the butter, salt and sizzle.  Server comped steaks and gave us desset to go.  Overall, all our needs met.  Happy time!  Just prob. won't go back for steaks.  Ruth's and Hillstone are MUCH better.",

    "text": "I could have eaten at least million million mini crab and lobster burgers, each with a side of the unbelievably delicious spicy calamari...oh, and don't forget the truffle fries.     Those were my favorite items, but the beef tenderloin burgers, mini lobster rolls and red pepper soup weren't far behind.  I was too full to try to dessert, and it sounds like I missed out on something really special.  What I did not miss out on was the drinks.  In fact, I tried one of everything (possibly more than one of a couple).  The red wine was remarkable and the cocktails were out of this world.    I felt like I had just left the Oscar's when I got home and checked out the contents of my swag bag.  Two free lunches...what??  And two free Stoli Dolis to go with those lunches.  Hell yeah!  Don't forget about the golf tees, chocolates, mints and pen.  To top it all off, my favorite thing about elite events, I had the pleasure of meeting new Yelpers and catching up with those I already know.  Robert L. and Shaina T. and Maggie F., you guys rock!    Also...can I just say that the ice sculpture kicked ass!  A huge thanks to Lindsey and Gabi for putting together this amazing event.  Lots of love to Nader for capturing it all on film so we can remember just how good we Elites have it for years and years to come.  And last but certainly not least, hats off the the Capital Grille staff.  They wined us and dined us from the moment we set foot in their house, and treated us as honored guests until the last of us departed.  Thank you!!",

I'm getting ahead of myself... *deep breath* Let me begin...  It was Resturant Week and me and my neighbor Sharrita chose to come here for a couple of reasons: Meat and Creme Brulee. What ever homesick girl needs to feel better. :)  We entered the very clean and classy and dare i say it - swanky setting with their hostesses who ware blazers and they were very welcoming and were very glad to seat a yelper. (they asked how I heard about Resturant Week when I called for reservations) Our waiter - dang I can't remember his name! he was so attentative and had one of those table sweeper type thingies and he recommended I try the best drink of the night - the Stoli Doli. Fresh pineapple stewed with Stoli vodka for atleast a WEEK before it's dispensed for sweet drink lovers (like me) smooth, delicious and slightly sweet. I was in love.   We had standard salads, nothing to write yelp about. I had the Filet Mingon and she had this steak that was sliced in half (if I remember) it came with veggies, again nothing to really write yelp about but everything was so yummy. The steak was well rested and cooked perfectly. I was very impressed.    One slight issue: we saw creme brulee on the menu on  the resturant week's website but when we got to the resturant, it wasn't there - boo... but our ever amazing waiter worked it out for us! YAY!! Thank Goodness he did because it was insanely good.  If you want a place that is swank, seriously fancy (I'm from the rez okay - so this is crazy fancy in my world)  and has GREAT service and even better steak... this is the place for you! But you better have the cash to pay for it all! lol but if you have the money honey and a need to wine and dine then trust me sweetie Capital Grille has the time! Just call ahead for reservations!",

    "text": "Let's just start by saying that I rarely eat at chain restaurants. So the fact that I ended up at Capital Grille for Valentine's day is actually a little embarrassing. But the combination of a $100 gift card that was about to expire, a fond memory of steak tar tar and homemade potato chips at their bar, and a failure to make any other sort of reservation landed us there at about 8pm on Sunday night. I really wasn't feeling like anything fancy, so we decided to sit at the bar, nosh, and watch the Olympics.  First, cocktails. Mine: an expertly made Manhattan that was approximately the size of my head (hurray for oversized martini glasses!) My husbands: Hendricks, rocks, cucumber. Our bartender offered to go get cucumber slices from the kitchen as it was a garnish they typically had at the bar. Score 1 for Kevin the bartender.   Next, food order. This had the potential to be the low point of the evening when they informed me they no longer had the steak tar tar on the menu. Or the ketlle chips. I now wanted to cry. We settled for a caprese salad, beef carpaccio, and the lobster crab cakes. Salad came out promptly, was very tasty and nice presentation. And then...nothing. The other apps lagged for like 15 minutes and the bartender was visibly irritated at the kitchen and wait staff. Luckily I had a full drink in front of me and it was the skating pairs short program on TV so I really wasn't complaining. When the food did show up it was actually worth the wait. Nothing I would have changed about it at all.  For the dessert portion of the evening we decided to try a Colheita port, which the bartender described as a single vintage tawny port. My husband loves tawny port and they had one that was fairly reasonable but still in the Colheita category. Rounded it out with the flourless chocolate espresso cake. Sadly, we were informed they no longer carried our port selection. And then, not so sadly, they poured us a much more expensive version for the price of the other one! Oh, and the dessert itself - freaking amazing. Best chocolate torte I've had in a while.   The actual shocker of the evening was that they took the appetizers off the bill without us saying anything about it. This really wasn't necessary but I think it shows that this place really does have class and that they wanted us to know that wasn't up to their standard of service. Well played.  Oh, and, right before we left the bartender leaned over and said \"Come back on a day when it isn't a holiday and we'll get the kitchen to make you some steak tar tar.  They do it for me all the time.\" Bless you, sweet bartender man. And thank you for a lovely Valentine's day.",

As could be expected, the filet mignon is amazing and always prepared as ordered. One special note is to look for the dark brown bread containing sweet white raisins in the free bread basket. That bread is something to seek out by itself.  One incredible appetizer is the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella. Every bite leaves you wanting one more.  And take home some dessert. You will be happy you did.",

    "text": "By far one of the biggest disappointments we have been through in a long time - with a big ticket attached to it. We went here for my birthday dinner and it was one of the worse meals I've had in a long time. I ordered the Chef's special - a steak served with shrimp on top, served scampi style. This came out on a plate with gigantic grilled shrimp on top. The shrimp were actually really good. Which is sad when it's suppose to compliment the steak. The steak, which is drowning in this scampi (greasy buttery sauce) is completely bland and has no taste - like not even seasoned with salt and pepper. Appears as if the Chef thought hey, all this greasy buttery sauce will cover up the need to season this piece of meat! I would expect this from a Denny's restaurant after a night of clubbing while in college - not for a nice sit down restaurant. I think I've had better steak at Outback Steakhouse. My boyfriend had the filet on the bone. It came out looking like a barbaric slab of meat from the stone ages - again the most bland seasoning you've ever experienced with a steak! Thank God this place had A-1 steak sauce to save grace - he drowned his steak in this to give it some flavour. Pretty sad when you have to ask for steak sauce at a fine dining establishment. Typically a good steak, seasoned and cooked well would require NO additional sauces used so that you could enjoy the full flavour - well this is not the case at this restaurant since the steaks have NO flavour at all. We ordered sides of lobster mac and cheese - this was good with big chunks of lobster. The potatoes were bland and unimpressive. The 2 impressive things about this place were the calamari for starters and the free cheesecake birthday dessert. The waitress gave us each one refill of our drink (I had soda and he had ice tea). The cups were literally the size of a kids cup - towards the end, she didn't even stop to ask if we would care for a refill - we must have hit our 2 drink maximum. Overall, a truly disappointing dinner experience for a hefty price tag of over $190 - with no alcoholic beverages. To pay this price for dinner and still walk out hungry is sad. Save your money if you want mediocre steak - go to Texas Roadhouse. If you're willing to spend the big bucks and want a good steak - go to Flemings or Mortons. Wouldn't come back here again...even for a free meal.",

    "text": "We visited CG recently for my husband's birthday and had a wonderful meal, top notch service and a really great time! The center of the table was dusted with birthday confetti when we arrived which was a nice touch. We started with a chopped salad which was the low point of the meal. It wasnt bad but it wasnt good either. I found myself jealous of the cesar salad that someone else had ordered because it looked much better. However, the rest of the meal was near perfect so let me move along. I decided to order a special- a filet topped with lumb crabmeat and red pepper hollandaise. WOW. It was so tasty! It was also smaller than the regular filet which turned out to be a good thing. We shared the au gratin potatos and the lobster mac and cheese and both were phenomenal! They were both very rich, and the potatoes were especially incredible. Even the sprinkling of crust on top tasted delicious!   For dessert we shared the flourless chocolate cake and the creme brulee. I have honestly never tasted better creme brulee in my life. It was perfect! The cake was good too, and I'm not even a chocolate person. Our server took a picture of us after dinner and printed it for us, which was a very sweet thing to do. Thanks Capital Grill, just give the chopped salad a makeover.",

The atmosphere was plesant and the service was not all that bad (waiter was at our table a little too much, interrupting conversation). The salad was ok. I could have had better elsewhere....lettuce was wilted. The filet was ok. My steak was not cooked very evenly and for a five star steak house I was expecting a perfect steak. It also had very little flavor itself. The port wine reduction helped with the flavor. The side was nice a truffle mac and cheese...but again nothing to write home about. Dessert was good. Pumkin cheesecake, my husband had the apple crisp. Would I go back and pay full price. NO. This is not a place for something new or different and the quality was below par.",
