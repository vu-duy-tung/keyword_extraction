This past visit I ordered the signature short rib with roasted vegetables and farro risotto. Very deep rich flavor. It's more of a winter meal so bad timing with a 110 degree day. I think the can do a more seasonal summer menu. 4 dishes were short rib based. My friend had the short rib dip. The jus was too salty. Service was good but a little relaxed.",

Our waitress was amazing, so nice and honest about menu/drink choices. Unlimited champagne for $15 was an awesome deal and our glasses were never empty. I also had the espresso martini, which was so tasty and coffee strong so I didn't suck it down too fast! We had the beet & goat salad, Mexican breakfast bowl, chille relleno, and braised beef ravioli. All of the dishes were scrumptious, the ravioli was my favorite with the short rib filling, cheesy sauce,  pine nuts and crispy prosciutto, a very rich and delicious dish! The ambiance, service, food and drinks were all Great! I will definitely recommend this place and will be back the next time I'm visiting PHX!",

This is high quality dining.  Eight in our dinner party, and the reviews were \"phenomenal\" from everyone.  Among the standout selections we had: tomato soup (fantastic), salmon (excellent), mac and cheese dish (well done), and the favorite at the table, tried by a few folks was the beef ravioli.  We had a few of the deserts, with the apple berry item getting the most nods of appreciation.  Very good whisky selection - I had High West Campfire - oh so nice - desert in a glass. Service was stellar with a capital S.   Bravo - The Covenant!!!",

    "text": "I went to dinner at the covenant with my husband and mom last night and it was the worst experience.  The place was mostly empty but the hostess gave us two table options.  Both near a large party of adults who had a bunch of kids at a separate table.  We sat near the door and the kids where super loud.  After being at our table for about 15 min the children started running around the restaurant and being loud.  No one did anything.  It continued to get worse so we asked our server if she would do something.  She said she couldn't do anything about it so we asked to move tables.  She moved us to the other end of the restaurant.  Then the loud table paid and went outside.  Our new table was by the open windows and the party that had left allowed their children to scream at the top of their lungs right outside our table for about 15 min.  We paid $200 for this experience.  The food was good but I can't believe the restaurant would allow this to happen.  They just turned their heads and ignored it all.  We will not be returning or recommending this place.",

I ordered a fritata that only had two of the items listed on the menu, then asked for a side of wheat toast that didn't come for 10mins then asked the server to check on it which I am sure she never rang it in but she blamed it on them being busier than what they expected (really?!?on a sunday brunch?!?) The toast finnaly came after another 10mins, and she brought us a white toast and when I said I had ordered a wheat she says: \"oh I meant to tell you we don't have wheat toast\". We finish our food and ask for check which comes in another 10mins late then I put a payment which she doesn't pick up for another 10mins... So to summarize, if you have a whole day to spend at this place go for it!",

The tables I was seated at (directly to the right when you walk in) are incredibly close to each other and our waitress kept trying to fit between our table and the one next to us to take our order and check on us. This is a better alternative to shouting, but I think they could work on the layout to make it easier on staff and patrons. It was also incredibly uncomfortable to be seated at a high-top style table right next to a booth where the booth is directly facing me eating.   I got the braised beef ravioli and it was oily and not worth the price. My boyfriend got the chef's cheddar mac, which he said was subpar. If you're looking to have an \"okay\" meal for a higher-end price in a ritzy locale, this is your place. Overall, I didn't feel I got the most bang for my buck and don't plan on returning.  Ambiance - great Food - okay Service - okay Price - not worth it",

    "text": "I've only been to The Covenant twice, the food was decent enough but in this case it was the service that upset me.  I have two real pet peeves, one being when you order your food before the table sitting next to you and your food arrives much later, like after the people at the next table have finished eating.  The other is when this happens and there are other service failures the establishment does not rectify them with a sense of urgency.  My wife and I had a different server than the couple sitting right next to us.  We put our order in about 4 or five minutes before they did.  I noticed that they ordered the exact same thing as my wife.   Over a half hour later, they receive their food and are now finishing up and our food has not arrived, even after our server assured us it would arrive soon.  It finally comes, delivered by the manager or expeditor.  My wife had requested no cheese and no cream, and it has cream sauce all over.  Not the server's fault because he repeated the order back to sans cheese and cream.    So we immediately notify the manager that the order is wrong before he can get away and he takes it back to the kitchen to correct the order.  Now, when you've been waiting so long for your food and it comes out wrong, I would typically expect some sense of urgency to correct it.  So we're waiting and waiting and I'm seeing dishes coming out of the kitchen, even the same dish my wife ordered going to other tables.  I feel like in this situation, you should go to the front of the line.  All they had to do was scramble some eggs, everything else was pre-braised.  So after about another 15 to 20 minutes her order finally comes correct.  No apology, no recognition of the service failure. Granted it was during Sunday brunch, but only we seemed to have problems getting our food.    In any case, the food is not good enough to overcome these service failures especially at this price point ($$$).    Fool me once shame on you!",

    "text": "Had a group of 8 to dinner last night and had TERRIBLE service. The waitress came around all of three times, took 35 minutes to get us our drinks, never asked if we wanted another drink and was extremely unpleasant. I even heard her say, \"what to do you want\" to one of our guest at the table while ordering. We had to flag her down to get pepper on the table and frankly, her attitude made us nervous to ask for anything else. Most importantly, I had to leave the dinner early and when I asked for my check, she brought it and said that gratuity was included. Given that I was in a hurry, I didn't give it a second thought. Once home, I received a call from my friend and the manager who questioned me on what the waitress had told me. Apparently they do not even add gratuity to groups! So this server attempted to pull a fast one on our group and unfortunately did so on me. I was told that when the server and manager approached the table to address the issue, the server said, \"were you not going to tip me\"? Unbelievable!   I will say that my cocktail, The Carri and Big was tasty and my salmon meal was just ok. My friend sent her food back because it was very raw which added more uncomfortableness because our server was irritated by that request even though we asked with the upmost politeness. Sadly because the service was so terrible, you couldn't pay me to go back here.",

    "text": "Totally impressed by this new hotspot from start to finish.  I've been there on two occasions so far and definitely plan to make it part of the regular rotation.  Walking into the restaurant, the colors and decor immediately pop with originality and stand distinguished amongst the crowd of other strong Phoenix culinary destinations.  A number of high definition screens are spaced evenly over the bar area but are also big enough for the surrounding tables to appreciate.  Bathrooms get a thumbs up for cleanliness.  On to the food - it's a fantastic mix that appropriately falls under the \"New American\" designation and truly includes something for everyone.  What is so fantastic about Covenant though are their unique riffs on familiar foods.  For example, rather than a standard burger they do a chorizo blend burger that is spiced to perfection and primed to trigger some binge eating.  Additionally, while a lot of other restaurants seem to veer away from doing a hummus appetizer these days (unfortunate), Covenant not only does it but adds their own mix of unique grilled vegetables and some drizzled honey.  I have yet to try their brunch menu but again, their blend and array of dishes is more than a little eye catching.  On the cocktail front, their signature cocktails are memorable and balanced to perfection.  For tequila lovers, the Handshake Deal is a must-have.  Although I wasn't able to pry myself away from the cocktails there yet, wine lovers will be pleased to know that their selection is a tour de force.  Considering that many restaurants don't have any Zinfandels on their menu, the fact that Covenant offers four different Zins should put things in perspective.  In other words, if you love wine and have a pulse, you're in good hands.  Finally, the service here deserves a special mention.  All staff were above-average pleasant and friendly to interact with, including the second time when a trainee was involved.  During my second visit we experienced two notable mistakes (plus the kitchen ran out of a dish), however, what really won me over was how the staff handled these incidents.  In each case, staff members not only immediately acknowledged and owned the mistake but they also really went out of their way to make sure things were fixed and our party was happy.  Their efforts meant a lot to us and we really left there feeling blown away by how professional the whole operation is run in all aspects.  While I would not hesitate to call attention to any restaurant's deficits, I have yet to find a negative things I would say about The Covenant.  Highly recommended.

    "text": "The food was great as well as the drinks and coffee. My issue was with our service. I was in there Saturday around 12:30pm for brunch with my girl friend at first our waitress was doing well, it was super slow the entire time we were there. Then she would disappear for long periods of time when we needed something and ended up asking other servers. When we were ready for our check it took 30 mins for her to come over. We let her know we wanted to split everything down the middle but my friend had an extra bloody mary on hers. She said okay and came back about 15 minutes later and my check was $23 my friends was $43. We immediately knew it was done wrong (we both waitress) and were trying to find her to fix it. My friend had to get up and approach another server and point out it was wrong as well as let him know we had an appointment to get to in 5 minutes. It took another 20 mins for 3 servers around a computer to figure it out. When our waitress came over she didn't apologize or offer to take anything off the bill for having to wait an hour for our check to even be given to us and then done correctly. Not sure if I will return because of this which is disappointing because the Bloody Marys, avocado toast, mascarpone toast, and cappuccinos were great!",

    "text": "My husband and I were so excited to try this place. We don't have super hip restaurants in this area so we eagerly awaited their opening and gave them about a month to really settle in before we went. The decor is beautiful and hip. The food, unfortunately,  just didn't live up to the rest. We started with the Ahi Poke appetizer and shared one of the chopped salads. The Ahi was good...just a little lack luster for the price and the chopped salad was pretty bland. My husband had the Fire Braised Short Rib and I opted for the Braised Beef Ravioli. His dinner was pretty tasty. I think I ate more of his than my own. The ravioli was so disappointing. I've never had ravioli that I needed to cut with a knife before. It was just dried out and chewy. I ate two of them and then just gave up. I was hoping the manager would be walking around. I'm happy to give my feedback, especially for a new restaurant. That never happened and the waitress didn't seem to care that I barely touched my food. Overall it was just OK. There are many really good restaurants, especially at this price point, that just get it right. SHOOT...there are many below this price point that I would prefer to go to. At the end of the day we will try them again, in maybe 6 months or so. Hopefully they will take the feedback offered to them and make some adjustments.",

And... it was OK.   The biggest barrier was the price. Virtually every drink was over $10.00. And they were all fine, but not particularly memorable. I also ordered a fancy mocha and I just wasn't blown away by it. The bitterness of the espresso overwhelmed the other flavors.  We also split a salad of roasted veggies, field greens, and additional hangar steak. The steak was absolutely cooked to perfection (I'd come back to try out a full steak for sure), but the greens were a bit too wilted and the veggies unremarkable. It was also essentially a $20 salad! The service was also disappointingly slow, particularly as we were one of only about three tables there.   Nothing particularly wrong with The Covenant, but outside of the steak, I just didn't get a lot out of it.",

    "text": "So far this place was rockin on opening day! Evidently the neighborhood has been waiting for an establishment of this caliber; I know I have! First off, bring a few bucks cash with you. There is absolutely no parking, but instead free valet so make sure you have a couple bucks for the guy parking your car. Don't be that jerk who parks At Trader Joe's.   At first glance, gorgeous place with no attention to detail spared. Glistening chandeliers, powder blue leather stools all around the rectangular bar and at the many high top banquettes. A few booths and a nice community table complete the seating arrangements. The bar is gorgeous, conducive to socializing and complete with a stunning \"whiskey wall\" as I'd like to call it -- it's a work of art -- and at least four HD TVs, two on either side.  In a nutshell: swanky, trendy, innovative, somewhat pricey, and loud. These are not necessarily negative things in my opinion; just things to know before you go, to prepare yourself. A definite plus: kitchen open til 11pm or later, depending on the day of the week.   Unfortunately for someone like myself who lives for happy hour, Covenant disappoints a bit. Great drink offerings: a few beers for $5, two crafted cocktails at $6, and four high end wines for $7 each. However, there is only one food offering during hh (which appears to change periodically/ daily); when I went it was a bowl of marinated olives for $7. Not a deal. They definitely need some hh food!! The menu, albeit fantastic and very appetizing, is spendy, so for folks like me, hh is something that is lacking. Considering there are at least six restaurants within a mile of here which have great hh, Covenant should step it up. Perhaps they don't feel the need to... that they'll do enough revenue without it, and I get that. I'm merely speaking from a local's pov.    So far that's my only criticism, as I haven't had a meal yet.  The menu is fantastic, including the wine list. Wines btg are pretty expensive compared to other restaurants in the area, but appropriate for this type of establishment. Overall Covenant has a great vibe; I quickly learned from the folks I met at the bar that this will definitely become a new neighborhood hotspot. I look forward to going back. Again, a perk: kitchen open til 11pm.",

Beef short ribs over risotto and the short rib ravioli. The short ribs fell apart with a fork yet were extremely tough. The risotto might as well have been raw. The ravioli was pretty good but way over-priced for the portion.  Service was slow. I think their kitchen is too small to handle the volume the place is generating. And, good for them.  If you're a drinker, come here. The bartenders all over pour. Might justify the crazy prices for their drinks.  Took a pass on dessert. They did look tasty.

It was delicious and my leftovers were plenty for my lunch at work the next day.  The service was excellent and the decor was gorgeous.  I'd recommend this place for happy hour, a date night, a corporate buy-out, or really anything else.  We'll definitely be back!",

Also ordered a 89 ale ($5) good value for happy hour. Food, HH menu was somewhat limited, ordered the sea stack ($9) good taste but somewhat overpriced for a happy hour menu item as there was only a single scallop. I also ordered the Brussel sprouts with chorizo, ($9) this was ok, kind of bland tasting but a good compliment if you order the burger ($12) but that is again overpriced for a HH menu item. I've had a far better HH burger at Fleming's HH for a lower price. Overall a nice place, excellent service (Esther) but needs a new face on its HH choices to bring me back.",

We managed to make it for the last part of happy hour and I ordered the French 75. They had 2 cocktails on the menu, a few beers and some snacks. It was a really great drink! My friend and I split the ceviche appetizer, which might be the highlight of my WEEK! So fresh and light! I could eat this as an entree and be perfectly happy.  Next I ordered the beet salad. It was good but I wish there was more salad and less beets. (Yes I said it... and I love beets!) It was a bit overwhelming and I think the portion would be small if you don't also order an appetizer.  Overall--The atmosphere was great and it was pretty busy for a Tuesday night! I would definitely recommend The Covenant. I'll be back to try breakfast next!",

I don't care how beautiful you think a place is... The real experience begins with the greeting. Do you feel welcomed? That's the big deal. Me, personally, I felt totally comfortable with my waitress, so starting up from there that is not a problem, but the hostesses at the door are umwelcoming. Because of that, and the prices of their menu I won't be back. But the real dissapointment is finding the one item in the menu that you finally knew you wanted is sold out. It's not funny when the waitress tells you, \"You see that dish there? That was the last one:/\" Sounds funny, but that's exactly what happened. We wanted the meat board sampler. It looked amazing, but I guess we had to fight for the last bite. Unnecceptable! I guess I was a little bit too late, and missed it by this much! And that's too bad. It was only 6pm. There's no manager coming to your table to check on you, or follow up, and there's really nothing special about the food or service, yet you will pay like if you're in Dubai. This place for me is a no-no. You can keep your uppity hostesses and high prices. Way too many amazing places in Arizona. There's no reason why.",

While the food is expensive it's worth it! $30 for steak and potatoes, $7 for the tomato soup with mini grilled cheese. $16 for veggie and hummus platter. All are shown in pic. There was only one chicken option that was not the breast, so vegetarian was the way for me. My man on the other hand said that steak was the best he'd ever had. Our waiter was very attentive, and suggested the cheesecake over the creme brulee, which ended up being very good. I asked when coming back how much the little grilled cheeses were since they were AMAZING and they are $3 each. Paired with the tomato soup they're so good. Excited to go back!",

    "text": "So I finally tried the covenant for happy hour. This is an interesting location that at one time was a shoe store and also a vitamin store. You would never know it when you walk in today.  It's a bit of a trendy bar and restaurant. But there's a little bit more substance than just sizzle. They are very much into using local supplies from farmers and other artisan purveyors. Maybe they take it a step too far, in the fact that of the beer that they have on tap, half of them are from OHSO, which has a location in the next parking lot. I would've liked to see other wonderful local beer choices. (If I wanted OHSO's beer, I would've gone there, just saying).   It's got a wonderful open feeling in the restaurant. The kitchen is totally viewable from the bar. And you can see all of the bustling activity going on. The bar is also uniquely set up with a hundred bottles of alcohol attractively displayed. As you move toward the back of the restaurant they have a very large wine storage glass locker that goes from floor to ceiling Maybe 16 or 18 feet tall.  The crabcake is very attractively served on a bed of arugula and unlike others it is not filled with crackers. I liked the charred octopus but would not preferred that come with roasted potatoes. They have a nice charcuterie board as well as a hummus board. And a goat cheese bruschetta and I know the goat cheese comes from my friend Wendell Crow's Dairy.   I did not try any of the entrees since I was there for happy hour. That will be for another day.",

Our bill was almost $70 just for 2 of us at lunchtime! It was ridiculous, and our waiter had absolutely no personality, who also happened to be the manager!! Not to mention when we walked in the restaurant, not one person greeted us. We had to get people's attention to even be looked at. And when we left, nobody looked at us either, and nobody said goodbye to us or anything. And mind you, there was only 4 other tables of people eating at the time. We saw the way they treated the locals in there, as opposed to how they treated us. It's pretty pathetic, that because we're not upper class snoots, that we get treated differently.

Service was mediocre which I'll say bc it wasn't busy but we had to wait every time for people to check on our water, ask for a check, etc. I got the beet and goat cheese salad with shrimp. The beets were chilled which sort of robs them of flavor. The goat cheese was slathered between the beet slices and so was also chilled and basically beet flavored instead of contrasting with the beets. The shrimp were well cooked but i chewed some grit twice so was all around underwhelmed. We'd been anticipating this place for a long while so it was a big bummer. Maybe they're still just getting their legs under them, but don't know that for the prices, i would risk another meal...",

The Typical Growing Pains: The servers and managers looked completely overwhelmed.  There wasn't much food coming out and you could see there was major confusion at both the bar and kitchen regarding orders.  We had planned to eat dinner but gave up on that idea.  The 'You Probably Should Fix This':  The bar needs to step it up. Example: the party next to us wanted martinis and their vodka choice was limited to Kettle One; then they didn't have stuffed olives....they gave up and just ordered something over ice.  You can't stock a Scottsdale restaurant like an airport bar.   And drinks aren't inexpensive here either....nor is the food.  We'll go back to give them another try after they have a chance to work through their first few weeks.  If nothing else it could be a pretty place to go for happy hour.",

The name and the color of the door and signage led me to believe that I was going to be walking into a unique situation. The menu selection is basic.  Nothing notable or super creative. The theme was very little protein.  The poke app was MAYBE 2 ounces of fish with too much sauce on an oversized wonton. The tuna bahn mi had about 3 ounces of fish (thinly sliced).  The baguette was not toasted and was heavily doused in vinegar. I don't know how the 900 degree oven plays a role, I suppose I will never find out since I don't have a strong desire to return. Strange restaurant. UPDATE: Just discovered that O.H.S.O. is a sister restaurant.  Makes sense. The food at O.H.S.O is just alright, but is priced well.  The atmosphere at O.H.S.O. is chill and fun.  I would rather eat \"just alright\"  at better prices at O.H.S.O. If I was choosing between the two restaurants.",

Their mission of making their own everything from scratch and farm to table experience is also why we went back more than once.

All three times we waited almost 10 min before someone came to see if we wanted drinks. Then it took so long to get them. She put he drinks on the table and quickly ran away and we waited another 10 min before she can back to see if we wanted anything else. Ummm yes, it's Friday night at 7pm , all four of us ordered wine.. of course we \"want something else\". All three times were the same. Poor service, long waits for drinks and food and the waitress , three different ones, were miserable and definitely didn't want to be there.  My girlfriend ordered a Chardonnay and it came out almost warm and we literally got an eye roll from our waitress when we asked for a new one. There are SO many other great places in Scottsdale to enjoy your evening. GO FIND THEM!",

Service: Mediocre (at best).  Not impressed when I ask the waiter to recommend his favorite dish...and he immediately responds \"the Tomahawk Steak.\"  Uhm...you mean the $89 Tomahawk Steak?  I'm good.  Food: Nothing on the menu looked particularly interesting.  Went with the Butcher's Steak. MEH....  Pretty tough and flavorless, plopped on top of some barely-identifiable, mushy veggies.  The potatoes, again - soft and lacking in flavor.  The tomato jam/sauce was one dimensional in flavor - sweet. Come one guys...add some heat or salt to the flavor profile.  For the same price, I could have had the super-yummy Hawaiian Ribeye from Hillstone...always a great steak, great flavor, cooked exactly as requested. Yum!  This place seems to have an identity crisis.  It feels as if an attempt to replicate Houstons/Hillstone/Grassroots....but falls short.  The Yelp reviews are pretty all-over-the-place.  Seems like this might be an okay spot for Happy Hour - for dinner, I'd pass.  Cheers!  POSTSCRIPT: My dog would like to report that she found the leftover steak to be quite delicious and succulent. Four paws up!",

It was difficult to get dairy free because they make things like potatoes ahead and put butter on them, so you can't get potatoes without butter. All dressings for salad including the vinegerette Dressings are creamy meaning they also have dairy. They did hand make a lemon and olive oil vinegerette, but there are places that handle allergies a little better. Was also extremely expensive for their lunch menu.",

Happy Hour is 3-6pm and the app and drink specials will rotate.  All smiles here. Update- stopped by again for a happy hour drink which was fine, server wasn't to attentive but I think they are still trying to find their stride...but---it was very warm and humid!  We had one drink and started chatting with another couple but we couldn't stay for a 2nd drink because of the heat.  Hopefully they'll correct this. Also, no apps on happy hour yet.",

    "text": ":-(((( This was our second time here. The first time was great: food, service,etc. This time was straight weird. It started when we walked in on a Saturday morning and the place was mostly empty. We wanted to be seated in a booth by the window. The hostess told us all of those tables were reserved?? Weird because in the two hours we were there, nobody came in to sit there. We thought at that moment that maybe this was a sign and we should leave, but we foolishly ignored our gut.  We opted to sit at the bar. The bartender was very nice and took good care of us. The weird thing was, she was wearing latex gloves. So we thought, maybe she has an allergy??? We knew it could not be for sanitary reasons because she went from cutting citrus to handling menus to making drinks. All while wearing the same pair of gloves. We could not resist. We had to ask her about them. She told us she wore the gloves for sanitary reasons, and yes, we could not help but point out that this was clearly not sanitary with everything she was doing while wearing the same pair of gloves. But in her defense, she was very honest with us about it and like I said, took good care of us.  We ordered drinks and food. The food seemed to be holding in nowhere land, we learned it was because they screwed up the order. This was shocking. Not really :-) The bartender was on it though and finally was able to figure it out and get our meal to us. Sadly, the delicious food we experienced our first time there did not happen this time. It was very sub par:-(( and we were super underwhelmed.  It is such a great location! Maybe they will figure it out.  Not sure we will risk it again!",

Ordered drinks which took a while. Then ordered food which took over 40 minutes. They cut our bill in half for the wait, but still it just wasn't a pleasant experience. And our waitress had zero personality. The food was maybe a 6 out of 10. Sooo overall while the place was nice; the service and food were not spectacular, especially for the price.

I mean you GOTTA mix some play into the day, so my girls and I headed over to The Covenant for lunch/early happy hour.   First impressions: Wow! Just wow. Absolutely LOVE the decor, the wine selection, and the fact that the windows open up so you get the outside breeze. We sat at a high top along with wall with the perfect breeze from outside. Our amazing server (I think it was Katie?) came over and got our drink order (Rose all day!), and recommended some appetizers, including the hummus board. We were sold on the hummus board, and when it was brought out, it was pretty much the most gorgeous and colorful hummus board I've ever seen in my life! (See photo).   For lunch, we each ordered different items so we could share/taste a variety of items since this was our first time here. I ordered the Grilled Cheese Melt -- and need I say more? It was ooey, gooey, melty cheddar cheese with tomatoes and bacon on sourdough, served with pesto tomato soup on the side. Perfection at its best!  One of my friends ordered The Farm salad, which, let me tell you -- this salad makes you excited to eat healthy. It was so colorful and beautiful, it looked like a bowl full of colorful confetti over a bed of baby field greens... and the charred lemon vinaigrette was phenomenal. My other friend ordered the Braised Beef Ravioli, so rich with flavor, yet cooked to perfection that it literally melted in my mouth.   Since this was our first time dining here, our wonderful server brought us out an apple crisp dessert... and although we were super full, we still ate it 'cause you know dessert doesn't go to the stomach, it goes to the heart.   Overall we had a great experience at The Covenant, and I'm excited to go back and try other menu items, as well as the Coffee Bar items!",

The hostess was a bit rude, but it was a busy night. Our server though was so sweet!  So food, we ordered the prime rib dip, the chefs mac, and the roasted chicken. I think everyone's favorite was the roasted chicken, it was so flavorful! I loved the chefs mac- it included shrimp and sausage. Prime rib was also great, there were no leftovers ha. I'm going to come back during the day to try their coffee bar! It has its own separate little checkout area and menu.",

The bar tenders and servers have never rushed me out at the end of the night. They are always so pleasant and fun to chat with. They have been great accommodating large groups and small groups the same. I love showing this place off to people. The chorizo burger is delicious and has so much flavor! The charred octopus is my absolute favorite. The ceviche is also a solid choice. I've tried the tuna Banh mi and the prime rib dip also, both delicious and flavorful. He house salad is always fresh and has nice variety. The Nicoise salad is another good option with tuna. The drinks are great here also! They have quite the variety of unique cocktails. Their coffee is also worth checking out. They have a lavender syrup that is a surprisingly good addition to their mochas. Our bartender today was Sara and she was so great! She gave great advice and insight on food options. She was attentive to our needs!",

One thing to note is that there isn't as much seating as you would think, so expect a wait on busy nights with the potential for parking difficulty.  The service overall is great, with helpful, friendly staff and short wait times.  BREAKFAST Great coffee selection from the espresso bar and a well-rounded breakfast menu. I've tried the avocado toast and the breakfast burger which is surprisingly filling. I RARELY leave food left over, especially in burger form, but this one had me beat.  DINNER Great appetizer selection. I had the grilled cheese for dinner, which was delicious, but slightly underwhelming portion-wise.  All around a great place to go with an awesome vibe. Try it out for sure!",

But really, it's just insanely convenient because I live nearby. The food is decent but never great... however, the drinks are outstanding. The staff are also outstanding. I wish the food was as exceptional as the bar and the staff.  Best thing on the menu is the hummus platter appetizer. They roast the veggies and smear the hummus along a board under the vegetables. It's delicious.  Their coffee is excellent if you're a coffee drinker.  The Ambiance is very odd. They've mixed a ton of different interior design motifs which makes the place feel a little overwhelming and confusing.  It's very loud, so beware that it's hard to have a quiet conversation.  If you go, ask to be seated in Gabi's section... she's the best server.",

We went on a Tuesday night around 8:00 p.m. so there were no issues with parking. During the weekend, I'm sure valet will be necessary as we have driven past this place and noticed that it gets packed.   I didn't think the menu was all that creative but the food was still good. I went with the pan seared scallops dish, my fiance decided on the short rib dip and my future BIL went with the butcher's steak. I thought the scallops were quite tasty and the polenta cake that came with it was a nice pairing. I was also a fan of the carrots on my plate - nicely plated as you can see in my photo.   My fiance did not care for his sandwich. He wished he had ordered something else. His brother thought his plate was a decent steak but nothing spectacular.   The bartender that was taking care of us was very nice and helpful as well. She actually recommended the scallops and I'm glad she did.   Not sure if it is a place we will frequent but we will visit once in a while since it is nearby and we had a good first impression.",

Upon entering the hostess didn't even smile when they greeted me and it was really awkward. Once i was seated my server came by and wasn't very informative, he seemed like he was possibly new. You would think that their would be higher standards for such an elegant establishment. Well I did order a French 75 and had a beet salad and the fire braised short rib. I was really disappointed in the food, it lacked flavor and for the prices that shouldn't be an issue. I spent nearly 80 dollars for myself and left unhappy. Received indignant looks from the staff. Probably won't be back. Too many restaurants all over the valley that offer better food and service for that price! Heck even restaurants that are inexpensive have better food and service.",

Our server Marie was knowledgeable, personable, and efficient. Overall a very good place that I will definitely frequent.",

I asked the waitress for a recommendation as I was torn between a few options. I thought I wanted the Banh mi sandwich, but she said that the soft fish on the hard baguette was off-putting to some patrons but that she had never tried it (strange that she would say that to me). I asked her about salads and she pointed out the Nicoise salad - it is listed in red type on the menu (house speciality) and said it was 'amazing'. So I ordered it. Amazing it was not. Zero flavor.  I mean, zero. Just a bowl of mixed greens with bland veggies. It supposedly had a vinaigrette on it but I couldn't taste anything. Really disappointed in something that was supposed to be amazing.   My friends and I did share the hummus board, which was ok. But it's hummus - it's hard to mess that up. I ordered a Moscow mule too, which was just average.  The food/bev was not inexpensive either - the quality & flavor is going to have to go up if they want to stay in business.   I am not a food snob, it doesn't take a lot to make me happy but I think I'll spend my money elsewhere rather than go back.",

At least acknowledge you if it's too busy. I'm ok waiting as long as I'm acknowledged.  I'll give this another try after they work out the quirks and update my review. Hopefully there won't be as many pretentious Paradise Valley old farts there...  The octopus, risotto and beef short ribs were delicious, but it took quite a while to get our food.   I like the fact that they have valet because the parking lot is small.",

I will definitely order again! The wine menu is perfection and I love all the by the glass options. I'm excited to try more items on the menu.

The wine room has glass walls and a double wrought iron staircase that is very cool. We went inside, never seen anything like it before.   The restaurant was very busy and for a first night, everything ran smoothly! Drinks were fun (OHSO beers) and the food is incredible. For some reason I did not anticipate such great food. We shared several dishes, half chicken, butcher steak and halibut. Beet and goat cheese salad and a melon salad. I would highly recommend all of them!  They are planning to do coffee in the mornings and light brunch menu, wifi etc so that will definitely be a stop on the way to work, or great to hang out at the garage door windows in the cooler months.   If it's as busy as I think it will be, parking could be a challenge. However, the valet service will make that a non issue.   Great addition to our neighborhood!!!",

We had been wanting to check it out for a while especially because the place looks so cool from the outside as you drive by and it's always full. I'll start off by saying the service was good, our waiter was helpful and friendly even when they messed up our drink order - no big deal. The biggest problem was the food, my boyfriend ordered the chorizo chili relleno which sounded amazing and for 21 dollars it should have been, it was plated nice but the flavors were just bland and there was definitely no chorizo. Also wasn't exactly a relleno which is usually fried, this was just a stuffed pepper. I ordered the smoked salmon plate and it wasn't so great either, the pita bread it was on had a weird taste like it was old. We spent 50 bucks for a meal that neither of us were even satisfied with. Overall if the prices were better we might have given it another chance but I can't justify spending that much for food that I don't enjoy. You could walk across the parking lot and go to OHSO and get a better brunch for half the price.",

My mom and I went for brunch and I was impressed! Our server was kind and attentive, but not distracting. I was served a good-sized and  delicious vegetable frittata, a side of potato hash, and a mint honey lemonade. Everything was made to perfection.  My only complaint, and why they didn't earn 5 stars, is with the pricing. I've been known to splurge on a good meal, and with no regrets. However, it's not reasonable to charge $8 for a flavored lemonade (non-alcoholic even!) when the frittata costs $13. Instead, go with their bottomless champagne for $15. It's not as ritzy but at least you'll get your money's worth.",

However, I LOVE this spot! On my lunch breaks, I go across the street and enjoy the Short Rib Dip, and the Charred Octopus. Both are excellent. The overall decor of The Covenant is vibrant, blue, open, and overall comfortable. The blonde lady bartender is always so sweet. The younger day bartender (shorter guy, beard, maybe 20-25?) also very polite and always on top of service.  For dinner, I love their wine selection and prices. Usually a bottle of Clark & Telephone (maybe 70 dollars which is a steal) along with the Chile Relleno or Short Rib.  An excellent spot, that would absolutely KILL IT in a spot like the Quarter or near Fashion Square.",

    "text": "This weekend is the \"soft opening\" of a The Covenant, situated on the northwest corner of Tatum and Shea. The Camelback corridor from Central Avenue east, the Arcadia area and of course Old Town and North Scottsdale have seen the birth of and a recent surge in some of the finest dining in the Country and now \"The Covenant\" brings 5-Star dining to a place where Paradise Valley-Scottsdale-North Phoenix intersect.    The atmosphere is open, bright, modern and unique and suited for young and old alike.  You would guess that there are tons of kinks to work out on the first night or two of business, but what they pulled off was flawless.  We were expecting long waits to get in, long waits to order and even longer waits for the 900 degree kitchen to produce our orders, but it was all obviously well thought through and rehearsed.  The staff all look like they are old pros at the food and beverage industry; no beginners here.  The menu is wonderful because it offers about a half dozen appetizers, but they vary so much that you want to try them all.  Nothing routine here.  Our favorite was the Charcuterie Board - a large portion of Prosciutto, Schrieners sausage,  roasted Piquillo peppers, honeycomb, Sea hive cheese, Point Reyes bleu Cheese and a delicious house bread.  There are only 9 or 10 entrees but like the appetizers, the variety is so great, that the menu is anything but boring.  We had the Tomahawk Steak - a flame roasted bone-in ribeye steak that was possibly where the 900 Degree Kitchen concept works best.  It melts in your mouth and was perfectly prepared to order,  The cut is so large, the bone is probably at least a foot long. We also ordered the Half Roasted Chicken which sounds ordinary enough, but it's mouth-watering and has the most amazing seasonings I've ever had on chicken.  It comes with fingerling potatoes, roasted veggies, charred lemons and a micro salad.  We also ordered the Chef's Cheddar Mac (Mac 'n Cheese) with andouille sausage, smoked wild Mexican shrimp, and a tasty trinity pepper relish.  We ordered a couple of desserts for the table that included chocolate panna cotta and a gelato affogato which was amazing.   They offer a variety of salads and of course some amazing looking burgers and sandwiches.  They will serve brunch on the weekends and I believe they're going to be open for lunch and dinner 7 days a week.    This is a great destination whether you're in Phoenix, Scottsdale or Paradise Valley.  The prices are extremely reasonable, with the Tomahawk Steak (which honestly is enough for two people) at only $59, which is a giveaway for Tomahawk.    The official opening is this Monday (August 28, 2017) according to the sign. The staff was amazing; starting with the valet, the folks greeting us at the door, our server, all of the managers and GM and even the owner.  The bartender (didn't catch her name) was all over it and the bar, which I'm guessing seats 25 is a great place to drink and is so spacious that everyone seated at the bar were eating full dinners, yet it's bar intimate too.  Plenty of large screens at the bars with a variety of sports playing.  Five Stars for sure.",

I visited in their 1st few months,  very crowded for lunch, service was slow but the food was good so i attributed to opening jitters.  The 2nd time was around Christmas with a group of 11 clients, service was again slow but now the food was just marginal, chalked that one up to holiday crunch.  Today was the last time I will spend.$30 pp and not have at least a 4 star lunch. Let me start with our server Bree was 5 star managing a bad situation. We were a party of 6 me and 5 clients dining there on my suggestion, some returns as we work close to restaurant. Today with the restaurant empty at lunch it took 25 minutes for the 1st 5 lunches and 40 minutes for the 6th a chicken sandwich.  My food a scallop dish while needing more salt tasted good but the sides were cold.  A couple of other repeat customers made remarks that the food quality had deteriorated since their last visit.  If not for Bree one star is in order.  Always wonder about restaurants that are empty when they should be busy.",

One friend mentioned she would have like more salmon on her Salmon plate, but other than that all was delicious. The Parking was a little tight and I could see this being a problem at popular times.

    "text": "Disappointing!  My sister was in town celebrating her fellowship graduation and an amazing job offer! We took her to The Covenant to celebrate with friends.  We walked in and no one greeted us for about 5 minutes. It's not that there weren't people at the front greeting station, or that they were busy with other customers, they just didn't make eye contact with us or acknowledge us.  From there we were told our table wouldn't be ready for another 30 min after our reservation time. We went to the bar to get drinks and for about 20 minutes, no one at the bar would make eye contact with us or even say \"I will be with you in a moment\".  We got our cocktails, were seated and met our less-than-stellar server whose demeanor was both condescending and unwelcoming. He smiled and commented on how he watched us struggle to get cocktails prior to being seated.  My brother had to ask for his beer a few times because they kept forgetting to bring it. At one point, my sister asked if she could have a refill on her wine-the server became defensive toward her because he immediately assumed this was another forgotten cocktail from a previous round.   While the food itself was delightful, the service continued to decline.   We requested to-go boxes, and the server handed the boxes to us for us to plate ourselves.  The restaurant closes at 11:00pm. At 11:15pm promptly, they turned the lights on and shut off the music...a bit of an abrupt approach for a clientele who paid nearly $100 per person for, what should have been, a meal and an experience.    When I made the reservation, I indicated that we were celebrating my sister's accomplishments. I'm sad that there was no mention- I guess I was expecting a nice dessert or something in her honor.   We dine at many restaurants around the Phoenix area. I can say with confidence that we would have gotten far superior service at OHSO across the parking lot.  If you're looking for a nice dining experience, or hoping to celebrate something in style, I suggest you take your party to Hillstone or The Gladly. Both of these restaurants provide incredible service, deliver excellent food and make you feel like you're welcome.  I wanted to give one star, but the food was great, so I gave two stars.",

Happened to stop in since its nearby the hotel im staying while in the area for work.   Wine selection is really nice w some of my own personal favorites represented. They had a big room setup in one of the corners that added to the decor.   Conceptually the waiter explained the food is prepared all from the open oven. No stove burners, no deep fryer, no vent hood equipment. Most of the food looks like is done using saute and sizzle pans in the oven. Imagine they just hit the various spots from the open fire within for temp range. Really interesting in the end to think about looking into the open kitchen concept.  Like every other restaurant these days they did have a sous vide setup which probably is how most items would be started and ultimately finished off w the large monster open oven setups.   Roasted octopus appetizer and hummus board suggested by our server def was not a bad recommendation. Octopus especially had a nice char from finishing in the oven.  Braised short rib was nice n tender. This was one of their \"red\" marked popular items and didn't disappoint. Huge portions of it as well.   There was a chefs surf and turf special which sounded good but you probably need to come here famished to have a shot at finishing. Tomahawk rib eye and a variety of seafood to compliment.   Id stop in again on future trips just cause its a bit diff than cookie cutter restaurant options in the area.  Solid meal all around and good option for those traveling through.",

I will definitely return to check out their dinner menu sometime.   On to the details. We showed up on a Saturday and there were a few tables full, but it wasn't crazy busy by any means. Score! We were promptly seated and the greeted by our waiter. He was super nice and grabbed our drink orders, then returned for the rest. I was debating between a few options and he advised me to go with the Mexican breakfast bowl and I am so glad I did.   I really enjoyed the food. I had an espresso as well and it was perfect. My breakfast bowl had great flavor and had eggs, short rib, onions and peppers, cheese, avocado and some cilantro sour cream. Amazing. I will be ordering this again when I return for another brunch. They also have $15 bottomless champagne but I played it sober today, so I'll have to check that out on my return as well.   The overall decor and vibe of the place is probably the coolest part. It's modern and trendy and just a cool place to sit and hangout at, especially since it wasn't crazy today. The bathrooms were nice and clean and they had good music playing. They were a little slow on delivering our checks but we were all chatting and more tables were coming in so it's understandable. I will definitely return!",

The restaurant definitely has a classy allure with a casual ambiance.  They serve up some modern American meals with a hint of some cultural punch like the Banh Mi, Poke Bowls, and Chile Rellanos.  Their drink selections are fun and extensive so take your time.  I'm a whiskey guy and the manager was willing to offer his suggestions and boy did he hit the spot for me!  I love it spicy and he did me well.    Moving on to the food since this is a food review, we started out with some brussel sprouts and steam clams.  The brussel sprouts were slightly roasted and came along with some andouille sausage.  Our steam clams came on a sweet and savory white wine tomato sauce.  It was so good I asked for another round of flatbread to soak up the sauce!  Sweet and full of chunks of tomato; it was savory with every bite!   For my entree, I shot for the Fire Braised Short Ribs while my friend got their barramundi.  She said it was well cooked and had a nice crispy skin.  My short ribs were on fire; but not what you think.  It's not spicy by any means, but man it was tender to the point where I didn't need a knife to cut through it.  The farro risotto added a sweet creamy texture along with the vegetables which was cooked to perfection; not raw, but still had a fresh crisp crunch.     Overall, our service was phenomenal and attentive.  The ambiance is fresh and cool; definitely need to come back for just drinks and HH.  Finally, the food was popping especially to my palates!  Enjoy!",

Fresh local produce , amazing taste that you don't have to add anything and the presentation PERFECTO!. They put the heart in soul of making these dishes! Perfect for Brunch, and 15 unlimited mimosas is a steal! Come check it out for the food the drinks and of course the ambiance!! Will be back again soon! Cannot is wait to try the dinner! Cheers!!",

There were five of us and we went on a Saturday and ate off the brunch menu. Two of us had lattes and two had lemonade (the lemonade is really good). For an appetizer we had the Hummus Board. Not what we were expecting, we have all been to Mediterranean restaurants and had hummus dishes and this one had barely any hummus! (For $19!) We ordered two Mexican bowls (def not Mexican - maybe change the name to Arizona bowls?), a half roasted chicken, two chicken Romesco sandwiches and a grilled cheese melt.   We all thought the food was just OK, nothing worth bragging about - very bland. And when the check came and it was $143, I realized that for the food they are serving, their prices are too high! Three stars actually feels kind of generous. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant and I'm not planning on ever going back.",

In a world where good service is sometimes hard to come by, Esther rewrote the rules and blew us away. If you're looking to make dinner plans, look no further than The Covenant.",

I wanted a place that offered different types of meals from great quality cut steaks to hamburgers.  This place had it!   When you first walk in the place is absolutely beautiful.  Different styles of seating areas from booths, to tables to high tops and the bar.  For dinner we started off with the shrimp and crab ceviche (unfortunately no pictures of that... sorry).    For dinner we ordered: Cedar Plank Salmon, Steak and truffled mashed potatoes, and Salade Nicoise. (See Pictures)  For dessert: Waffle topped with ice cream and berries, Creme Brulee, and Berry Crostada. (See pictures)  Everything was delicious!!! Now, the ONLY reason for the 4 Stars versus 5 Stars is because the seating in our booth were very dingy and dirty. I am so picky when it comes to cleanliness.  However the service was wonderful and we definitely will be returning!",

It was well decorated and what we would consider a modern eatery.  Our server, Brett, suggested a bourbon cocktail for me and my wife had a glass of wine.  Both were amazing.  We then ordered the crab cake and the beet and goat cheese salad.  The kitchen gets kudos because when they deliver the salad, they split it in two for us and the presentation was world class and it tasted just as good as it looks.   The crab cake was delicious too but we wish it would have been a little thicker with more lump crab in it.  Overall, it was a great experience and we will definitely be back to try the entrees.  The ambiance and vibe was fun as well.  If you haven't been here yet, give it a try!",

    "text": "I usually hit The Covenant about every other week so have been several times and can confidently say this is a solid 5-star restaurant.  Not 4-Star, but the full 5.  The Covenant is owned by the same people that own O.H.S.O. Breweries, but that's really just a point of interest because I don't see any similarities in food, service or atmosphere at all.  The Covenant is more like an updated Houston's.  To find The Covenant, look for the Trader Joe's or Whole Foods at the Northwest corner of Tatum & Shea.  The Covenant  (and an O.H.S.O.) is right next door, right on the corner.  Just don't park at Trader Joe's.  They don't like that.  I've never had a problem finding a spot at the restaurant, though.  First of all, it's just plain beautiful inside, with a more casual bar section that opens up to the outside, or a couple of dining room areas that are all equally as nice to sit in.  Mostly booths, and some tables.  It just so happens it's usually half price bottle of wine day - Sunday or Monday - when I go, which is a nice happenstance indeed.  Their wine list isn't excruciatingly long, but does have a lot of really nice choices that can be a steal when half price.  For example, bottles that go for around $80 normally go for $40, and then I see that same wine at Costco for $30, which essentially is a $10 corkage.  Not bad at all.  And the wine is outstanding.  Their cocktails are even better than their wines.  Great signature cocktails made well with high quality liquor and ingredients.  The menu has a nice mix so there's something for everyone.  I recommend everything, especially the fish if they have it on special (it's not a regular menu item), and the braised beef ravioli - oh and the mac and cheese with sausage and shrimp.  And the Chopped Salad.  I did say everything...unfortunately not the steaks which haven't been as good as everything else.  They do take reservations.",

    "text": "Wanted to love it., but ended up being underwhelmed by the food AND service. Went on a Sunday afternoon at 1pm.  It was moderately busy but not slammed. Plenty of open tables.    Son had the grilled cheese and soup which was tasty.  I ordered the chicken sandwich.  It had absolutely no flavor.  The bread was good and I was starving so I ate half of it and gave the other half to my teenage son...who took just one bite.   Now, they are new and I can overlook that IF the server or anyone for that matter acted liked they gave a sh$t. I told our server what I thought of the sandwich and he did offer to get me something else....but we had already waited a lonnnng time for one coke and for our food to come, so I passed.  Either he didn't pass my comments on or management doesn't care about their customers experience...not sure which.  Along with that, waters were never refilled and by the time our server checked in after delivering food, the son was finished and I had eaten half my sandwich.   Waited another several minutes for the check. While waiting, I looked at the wine list.  YIKES!!  super steep prices!!   Not sure we will try again or just wait it out at OHSO. :o/",

We asked for the volume of the music to be lowered since it was so loud we could not hear our table mates.   We ordered the hummus appetizer which was interesting and tasty.  We asked the server about the daily fish special and although he knew what it was, he had no description of it. Was it a steak? Filet? Dense? Flakey? Sweet? Strong tasting? Preparation?  We had to ask to have the hummus cleaned from the table top since it had flowed over the edge of the serving board.  We also had to ask for the appetizer plates to be removed when we were finished with them.   A requested medium rare burger was presented very well done. When a replacement burger was brought, it was still overdone.   We repeatedly had to ask to have our water replenished and often our server was no where to be found.   When we asked for our check it took almost fifteen minutes for our server to bring it to us.   The service was very, very poor, the food fair. This restaurant needs a manager to oversee and coordinate service and food!   We will not be frequenting Covenant again.",

The service was on point and the the staff was super friendly. That being said the food was lack-luster. Hubs had the chicken romesco sandwich which sounded amazingly complex but had no wow factor taste wise. My ravioli had great potential with crispy prosciutto, toasted pine nuts and peas but the filling of short ribs was missing the punch of flavor it needed to complete the dish. With all the good points it had, the food is the most important thing and it was just ok. May give them some time to tweak the menu and try again since it had potential.",

Sad sacks here. Instead it was a swanky, mirror, crystal and Tiffany blue retro-fitted ex-shoe store with a trendy and expensive menu to match. Pretty, yes but definitely for a bar crowd who wants to be seen and prob better (and even more spend) at night.   Seared tuna banh mi sandwich had the right flavors and the beef and bleu burger was good but it was a speedy little outing more appropriate for those who want some sparkle.",

We sat in a super comfortable booth that had a huge open window so it felt like dining outside while being in the comfort of this glitzy restaurant.  We started with a bottle of wine and got a little crazy as we ordered the Poke appetizer but also the Chefs MAC and Cheese.  It is typically an entree but we decided to share for an app.  It was tasty.  Cooked perfect!    After that we decided to share 3 meals for 4 people. The very best was the ribeye. This steak melted in your mouth.  And it was perfect to share so everyone could have a taste.    We ended with coffee drinks that were just out of this world and a great dessert.   The waiter was attentive but not too much and the Manager came over to insure we were having a great experience.     A super place for a date nite or going out with friends.   Don't plan to eat and run.  You have to enjoy the adventure!   Highly recommended!!!",

My husband ordered the corn beef hash with two eggs Sunnyside up. The eggs were a bit too runny and the corn beef hash had big chunks of corn beef in it and it wasn't as good as it could've been.

The restaurant itself is breathtaking inside.  The decor is super elegant yet one is still able to feel relaxed.  My friend and I are both in the industry so when we are able to get out of our restaurant early enough (very rarely lol) we try to rush to somewhere in time to catch some decent food (not just bar food).  My friend and I have been here twice in the last several weeks and the late night service at the bar has been very good.  The bartenders and manger have been very welcoming (which is important to me because so many times this is not the case in the industry and this is what we do).  The food is also to die for!  We have had the tuna poke twice, the chopped salad, and the beet and goat cheese salad with scallops.  We were very impressed (especially considering the late ordering).  I would highly recommend this place.  I also think they mentioned 1/2 off bottles of wine on Sunday and Monday but don't quote me on that ;-) !  Thanks again!",

I've been here for happy hour before and sat at the bar and it was pretty good so thought it would be nice to try a meal at some point too. So we made a reservation for today, were seated in one of the large booths towards the back of the dining area close to the restrooms. I didn't think anything of the location of the table at the time, but towards the end of our experience realized that it can't be easy to check on the tables back there without actually walking over there. Which no matter what, the server should be keeping a good eye on the tables he or she is taking care of.   That said we took our time ordering our food. We ordered Lavender Mochas which came out first and were very delicious. It then took a while for the server to come back for our food order which finally we were like hmmm is this person ever coming back? The place was pretty busy, but not overloaded to where they couldn't handle quality service. We'd been there over an hour at this point which wasn't too bad as we were all busy chatting. Anyways we finally order. I got the chicken sandwich. Another 45+ minutes goes by where finally we're like hmmm what happened to our food? Finally it comes and one of the managers expressed a brief apology about a back up and mishap in the kitchen. Okay, no big deal since we have our food now. Well sadly the bottom bun on my sandwich was soggy so it must have been sitting for a bit of time in the kitchen area to become that soggy. Too hungry at this point to say anything or send it back, I just dealt with it.   Once we finished we didn't see our server until she swiftly comes by asking if we need any boxes. Took a while to finally get the one box we asked for, but the server disappears for a long period of time once again. Finally we had to wave down someone, anyone to get our server to close us out. What we hoped would be a casual Sunday lunch catching up with some girlfriends ended up being a bit of a let down in terms of the restaurant experience and service. I want this place to succeed, but I think there is some lack of attentiveness with some of the staff - or something, but I probably won't be going back here anytime soon. I'm not even in the neighborhood and made a trip from downtown Phoenix to try it out.   Hopefully some significant changes can be made because I'm impressed with the ratings on Yelp for this place! Hopefully something was just off and we had bad timing in coming in today. We didn't even have mimosas or cocktails either!!!",

After waiting ten minutes at the front desk with no one coming over to seat us in a half full restaurant we sat at the bar. We waited 10 minutes at the bar watching the bartender on her cell ignore us when the bar was close to empty. We saw the girl back at the hostess stand an ran over to get seated for a second try. We were seated 15 minutes with not one wait person stopping by and got up from our seats walking out with no one even noticing on staff. Not impressed!  Went over to oshso for great services",

    "text": "The Covenant is a good local foodie restaurant, in a part of town that really needed it. The food that is good, is very good and the places where they miss the mark, they really miss the mark. Let's start with the bad. When I visited the Covenant for Brunch there was no drink specials. According to their website, they have since added $15 bottomless mimosas, but unless you want to get completely smashed on a Saturday or Sunday morning, a $5 Mimosa or Bloody Mary option like Rusconi's has across the street, would be a better offering in my opinion. For food I ordered the Roasted Vegetable Frittata. The menu says that it's made with farm fresh eggs, spinach, seasonal vegetables, heirloom tomato, basil, goat cheese, and an arugula salad for $13. There was no accompaniments, no side of potatoes, toast, or even salad like the menu states. Just the frittata. The salad is a green garnish on top. This was one of the worst breakfasts I may have ever ordered. I was hungry, it wasn't very tasty, and I was disappointed that the salad was a sad garnish. I ended up ordering a side of toast and jam, making the subpar meal even more expensive. My date had the biscuits and gravy. The eggs were cooked perfectly but overall presentation looked unappetizing. He said that it was OK but nothing great. I wouldn't recommend these two dishes, but there may be other items on the brunch menu worth ordering.  Lunch at the Covenant was AMAZING! I ordered the Grilled Cheese Melt white cheddar, sugar cured bacon, heirloom tomato, sourdough, with pesto tomato soup for $12. The white cheddar cheese is so rich and flavorful, the sugar cured bacon and the heirloom tomatoes are perfect and the pesto tomato soup was delicious too. Dinner at The Covenant was also good. We ordered the Half Roasted Chicken which comes with smashed fingerlings, roasted vegetables, pan sauce for $24 and the Butcher's Steak which is pepper crusted hanger steak and comes with crisp fingerlings, roasted vegetables, cipollini onion jam for $29. Although both were good the Chicken was definitely the star of these two options. The skin was perfectly crusted and the potatoes and roasted vegetables were cooked to perfection. The Steak was good but really paled in comparison to the Chicken which was the star. We also ordered an Espresso from their extensive coffee bar. It came in this fancy cup and was very tasty! The Dessert was to die for. I highly recommend saving room for the Berry Crostata. The flakey, buttery pastry was topped with roasted apple, fresh berries, drizzled with a sweet honey sauce and topped with fresh whipped cream. One of the best deserts around hands down.

My friend ordered her cocktail 3 times, and it never came. So she was finally given a drink on the house, but then she said it tasted awful and she did not want it.  I ordered a green salad with roasted veges. They tasted like soap. I can't imagine what is going on in that kitchen! Hostess was very nice (again), and I was not charged. Another friend had a glass of wine, small cup of soup, a tiny side salad, a tiny bowl with a piece of octopus and her bill was $38. Very little food served for so much money. Someone said the scallops were good. On the positive side, the decor is lovely to look at, so just go for a glass of wine and look at the light pretty fixtures.",

Last night we had a reservation for a very early dinner with another couple. The restaurant was not crowded .I was immediately told by the young lady that my reservation for 4 was not found and then, that it had been canceled. I had made this reservation myself on the phone a week prior and showed the gal the confirmation text I had gotten the day before.... our male server had a bad attitude and seemed like the last thing he wanted to do was wait on us. He was very disinterested in answering menu questions and we had to ask him to wipe us a spill from the appetizer we ordered. I won't go on, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. At this price point, waiters should be way more happy and accommodating. I did not like my dining experience at all. A We will take our business elsewhere... no shortage of great places around here.",

I love the high ceilings and huge bar in the center of the restaurant. Unless you are a San Diego Chargers fan get used to their bright yellow and blue colors.  We ordered the chorizo chile relleno, pan seared scallops, charred octupus, braised beef ravioli and poke tuna. There was plenty of food for our small party. The relleno had some delicious crumbled feta and corn creme on the side. The scallops were cooked to perfection with a golden brown crust and moist all throughout. We loved the beef ravioli. The ravioli is stuffed with some tender beef and the creamy pesto sauce was the best.   I really enjoyed my experience here. The ambience was really nice and the service was superb. Definitely book a table way in advance as this place fills up rather quickly. If you are looking for a hip place to dine with some locally sourced ingredients this the spot.",

We had to go up and ask if we could get a server after sitting well over 10mins. We ordered the $15 bottomless mimosas and they only came over 1 time to refill our glasses. When the food arrived it was warm and quite bland not a lot of flavor for a\"Mexican bowl\". We asked for salsa and they only had bottled hot sauce which is fine but the really kicker was we asked for a cake or dessert to celebrate our friends birthday (we would pay for it)the response was Ridiculous \"we don't sing for Birthday's\" and the server walks away and immediately drops off the bill .  This place went from a great go to spot to go only for drinks and sit at bar because they still a nice ambiance.",

Perfect place for any occasion to have a girls day, date night, or host a party. Our server was a gentlemen and he was fantastic! Unfortunately I don't remember is name. This place was pretty busy but I love that they accept reservations and it's easy to make on yelp. I love the open kitchen concept where you can see all the fresh ingredients and amazing food they are putting out.  $15 for unlimited champagne during brunch, extra $2 to add a glass of OJ which lasted about 3 refills. I also got a lemonade which was fresh squeezed and the best I have ever had! So refreshing and would make a great summer cocktail. The food menu was great with a ton of options. I got the grilled cheese melt with tomato soup. It was very good and the perfect portion. The soup was pretty simple but paired well with the amazing grilled cheese filled with crisp bacon!! My friend got the roasted pulled chicken sandwich which was huge and looked incredible. She enjoyed it as well! We ended the meal with the apple berry crastada dessert which was light and had the perfect amount of sweetness.   Overall everything from atmosphere, service, and food was excellent. We had such a great time. I can't wait to come back and bring friends and bring my husband for date night. Dying to try that famous huge tomahawk steak for dinner! See you again soon!

So glad that chance finally came about!  To start, the feel of the restaurant is just cool. It's beautifully done with blue bar chairs, a giant glass wine walk-in, and modern decor. It has an open, airy feeling to it all and I immediately felt relaxed in there and ready to get some upper echelon grub on.  And the food didn't disappoint! We started with the charcuterie board which had homemade sausage, grain mustard, blue cheese, honey, roasted red peppers, prosciutto, olives, another white cheese (forgot what the waitress said!) and pita bread on it.  It was fun to mix and match all the flavors on the board and was a good start to the meal.  But the real star were the mains. We ordered the Pan Seared Scallops (comes in a citrus beurre blanc sauce that rocked), and the Fire Braised Short Rib. Oh. My. Goodness! That short rib was EVERYTHING!!! So super tender that I didn't even need to use my knife to cut into it. It comes on a farro risotto with an onion foam, and it was like a flavor bomb in my mouth. Definitely will have to come back to have that again!  One thing to note, is the place is kinda pricey. For those 3 things and 3 glasses of wine, our bill came out to $130ish before tip, which was steeper than I was expecting, but won't deter me from coming back again now that I know that's where the price point lies.  Can't wait to try some of the other fun things on the menu!",

The staff was great and noted the fact that on Mondays, bottles of wine were half off. Score.  I highly recommend the tomato soup and the ravioli.  The soup came with super crispy and buttery crustini to dip into the buttery and rich soup. Yum.  My ravioli was fantatic and they didn't pile tons of it as a serving; just the right amount.  My counterpart ordered the braised short ribs and they were amazing. Fall off the bone tender and full of flavor.  I'll definitely return to this location and check out the happy hour.",

I was here to celebrate my girlfriend's engagement.   Food:Tomahawk with creamy mash truffle potato and mixed vegetables. My girlfriend ordered it, she said it was very flavorful and  extremely juicy. It was a surf and turf with grilled shrimp which were a little dry but still had flavor.    Her fiancee ordered a sirloin steak with the same sides, boy did it look awesome.   All of the alcoholic drinks were awesome! Order the French martini....so yummy!   Our waitress was Carissa who was attentive and helpful.  Every item Carissa recommended was excellent.    Dessert: a delicious coconut, chocolate layered cake.   Make sure you bring money, the tomahawk was $89 but it feeds two people (so why did my girlfriend eat the entire thing herself) lol..   This place is a great hang out with the girls, wife or girlfriend date night, side chick date night, the girl your trying to make your girlfriend jealous with.....you know! It's the new must be seen place and with good food too!",

I made a 10:45 reservation via Yelp for four people (me, my mother-in-law, my grandmother-in-law, and my daughter).  I wasn't sure how it would work out for my 5 year old, as I didn't know if The Covenant offered a kids menu, but they did, and it worked out just fine.  This time my party was seated in Gabby's section, and she was fabulous.  My daughter did the kids pasta and fruit and the adults shared a hummus board, avocado toast, and a frittata.  It was more than enough food.    The special chocolate covered strawberries for the mothers at the end of the meal were a very nice (and delicious surprise).  Thanks so much and Happy Mother's Day to those reading this today ;)",

I was between the Poke or the crab cake or the grilled Octopus. Server said.... go with the Octopus! Done!!!  My friend ordered the goat cheese and beer salad.  Both arrived and were beautiful. Great presentation! Mine was spectacular! Was served in a tomato broth with chorizo and potatoes. And a warm pita. I could have eaten another order!  Friend said her salad was great too.

I am not a huge scallop eater, but these are probably the best I've ever had and I live near the beach in SoCal...and this was in Scottsdale...Arizona!!!! No beach close. ;-) The interior is decorated so cute and so interesting and the service was very attentive, and I really liked their drink menu and wine list too. Everything else that we ordered was good but the scallops are definitely memorable. Every time I'm back in Scottsdale I must visit here at least once. Absolutely love it!",

That was pretty awesome, especially since their prices are on the high side. I tried a couple of different cocktails, both of which were yummy. The hummus board was the highlight of our meal. Great tasting and lots of fresh veggies. For my main course, I had the grilled cheese melt, minus the bacon. The grilled cheese was nothing special, but the tomato soup with pesto that came with it was really good. For dessert, I had the Belgian liege waffle sundae. It was very dense and cold, so think they may have defrosted it just before. Again, nothing special; it looked better than it tasted. I've had liege waffles elsewhere that were much better. Overall, I liked The Covenant and would return, but I wouldn't consider it a 'go to' restaurant for me.",

Very cute interior. I loved the chandeliers and the open windows so it feels like you are outside but not technically since it was 96. Almost gave off a vintage lounge vibe..   As soon as we sat down, my husband ordered a bottle of Chardonnay and I got a glass of prosecco. A small wine selection but it was half off.. even better!   We started w the hummus board and goat cheese bruschetta. The hummus comes w roasted veggies n what made it soooo delicious was the honey!! The combination of savory n sweet! We all thought it was amazing!! The same w the bruschetta. The pistachios, dates, w goat cheese n also the orange blossom honey!! The sweet and savory combo was perfection!!! We also got the chef's cheddar Mac n cheese but without the sausage n shrimp n added chicken instead. It was very buttery n my tastebuds were very happy!!  As for my entree, I got the braised beef ravioli which was paired w a creamy pesto sauce, toasted pine nuts n crispy prosciutto. It was fantastic!! My husband got their pan seared scallops which was slightly undercooked but still very tasty.   Besides the screaming baby sitting behind me, N getting hit on the back of the head, I still enjoyed myself. And only complaint was that after our server dropped off our bill, he was never to b seen for like 15 min so my husband had to go find him...   Cute place n good food.",

While many people recommend the salads, I personally do not. The Poke was also disappointing due to the wonton chips not being fried crispy enough. Both the appetizers we ordered were meh. But the thing that made it up was the entrees! Every entree we ordered were delicious! The beef ravioli was one of my favorite things on the menu. While their appetizers did not appeal to us, the entrees won us over. I would suggest skipping the appetizers and jumping straight to the entrees!  Overall my experience was very nice here. We had a toddler with us and they were very accommodating. The waitress was very nice to my nephew and made our time here that much better. She was very attentive and made sure we were always satisfied and had what we needed.   I will be back the next time I am in town to try more of their delicious entrees!",

She makes sure that everyone is taken care of and has a great work ethic, you can tell. As simple as this is, the grilled cheese and tomato soup was actually pretty dang good.

When I grew up, there was a shoe store here with a basketball hoop in the front, and so I guess I have some sort of nostalgic connection to the geography of the place. But ultimately, taking over for a show store doesn't mean that you can make decent food, unfortunately.   It's not all bad. The place has nice decor. The staff are very nice and helpful (although I feel like we were being helped by a manager the whole night - something about the way he was dressed and running around - maybe they were short staffed). The drink selection is fine, if a bit on the pricey side.  The problem is the food. I got the cioppino on the server's recommendation, and good lord was it bland. Not for lack of things - there was all manner of dead sea life in the bowl (octopus, shrimp, fish, scallops) and some sort of ground meat (pork? Chorizo? Couldn't tell) and potatoes, but it honestly just tasted like jarred tomato sauce from a can. When you're paying $30+ for a cioppino it has to be better than that.  I really wanted to love this place; it was cute, the service was good, and the intersection just needs more classy restaurants. I overheard that they are somehow related to OHSO - they should stick to the bar food.",

Really nothing special, and there were 4 pieces while the waiter said 5. Next, I ordered the frittata. Like the avocado toast, it was very bland. Pretty tasteless, actually, that I had to douse it in Cholula and even then it barely cut it. My friend had a breakfast bowl, and said the only thing that saved it was the avocado salsa. Which is supposed to be a garnish. So all in all, the taste didn't live up to the beauty and I was very disappointed.",

I started with a vodka cocktail, the farmers market. So refreshing and citrusy but not too sweet - delish. Three of us shared the octopus appetizer which was fantastic. The octopus had a nice char with good seasoning and was wading in a tomato broth goodness that also had chorizo and fingerling potatoes. Such good flavors! We did family style sharing on entrees. Chopped salad, Mac and cheese, and tomahawk steak. The chopped has smoked salmon in it (very much like the gladly chopped but not as good IMO) and dates. A nice salad. The Mac was fantastic--cheesy but not overwhelming. It has a spicy dollop of pepper relish that you can mix in our take in small bites with your Mac. It's not visually appealing, but it tastes great. Taste it before you mix it completely with the Mac. The star of the show was the steak. Cooked to perfection and seasoned so well! Just a great steak. Served with, I think they were called potato croquettes and roasted vegetables. Oh yes. Nothing on the dessert Keanu piqued my interest so we passed.",

We were sat at a booth immediately and advised the hostess we were waiting on friends. We had water and drinks in front of us in no time. Once our friends arrived we started with an appetizer which was the hummus board. It was truly amazing and I would have been fine with just this and my glass of Moscato. Everyone at the table agreed and my wife wants to go back for it again!! I ordered the chorizo stuffed Chile relleno which was incredibly delicious. My wife ordered the melted grilled cheese with tomato, I want to call it bisque, which she said was amazing. Of our friends, one ordered a frittata which she said was delicious and it was also HUUUUUGE and her husband ordered the seared tuna sandwich which he greatly enjoyed. The Covenant is a wonderful place to enjoy some delicious food and enjoy a nice time with friends. I HIGHLY recommend it.",

Also just because you're wearing latex gloves does not mean you can touch every surface, wipe down a station and then serve food wearing the same gloves. They really need proper sanitation training here.",

The issues lay in the food and price. I went there for lunch and spent $47 on a sandwich, salad and 2 iced teas. I don't mind paying the price for top notch food but this food was not it. I had the Feta and Melon salad. Luckily I added ahi tuna or else I would have been left with just a bowl of fruit. I expected a little more salad and a little less fruit. There didn't seem to be a dressing on it all, just the spices and juice from the fruit. Honestly the avocado and  tune saved the meal for me. My mom had the Chicken Romanesco sandwich. The sandwich was actually really good ( wish I had ordered that) but she ordered a side of vegetables that had almost no seasoning on them and seemed a bit over done.   I am truly hoping that the menu improves. Its way too expensive for the mediocre food. For now I will go to O.H.S.O.",

We decided last minute to go check it out for happy hour and the first thing they first thing they asked was \"do you have a reservation?\" And there were multiple tables open and then they told me I could only sit for 1 hr since they had reservations. We finally were able to sit and the happy hour menu was very disappointing with hardly any options. This place is just too uppity for me and is NOT the \"friendly neighborhood\" place I was hoping it would be! The decor is great and very fancy just not my cup of tea.",

We were offered spots at the bar or to take seats at their \"communal tables\"...I'm usually fine with communal tables, since they're long and spaced out for parties. These were two separate 6 tops. We had another couple join the table in the middle of our meal and it was just...weird. At least join the two together to space people out? I noticed at least two other parties walk in, say they didn't have a reservation, but then get seated at a table. Huh.  Anyway, we wait way too long for our server to greet us. She apologized, but we were about to walk out. (See previous review re: Fox RC's being the only ones to do it right, which is so odd to me.) Luckily, the food was great. The hummus board is a work of art, and all the veggies were drizzled with pesto and local honey. It was such a great, beautiful version of a hummus appetizer. I opted for the half chicken, which was served with some more of the same roasted veggies and smashed, roasted fingerlings. It was all delicious, as was my husband's braised short rib over risotto. The wait between our appetizer and main course was, again, way too long.  We spent over $100 for dinner, and were just a little underwhelmed by everything but the food. Probably a pass in the future. But kudos to the kitchen.",

The chandeliers are gorgeous and the details of the decor were nice...will say we were a bit confused by the tvs playing sports, as this appeared to be a place that was attempting to give a more upscale vibe.  Smaller menu, but the food all sounded delicious!!  I was really excited about the melon and feta salad!  Our server was Drew and he was nice.  For drinks, we ordered an OHSO beer, a glass of \"complicated\" Chardonnay (which Drew said was recommended by owner, explaining she had chosen all the wines), and a lavender cappuccino.  For dinner, I had the melon and feta salad and added Mexican king prawns (delicious!!), and my friends had the short rib ravioli and the grilled cheese/tomato soup.  All the food was excellent!!  The cappuccino was delicious, but the wine was just average.  Was a little disappointed in the price points for the wine by glass.  Overall, good food, decent drinks, inconvenient location, good service.  I would go back again!",

We tried a little bit of everything 3 apps(Try the octopus), 4 specialty drinks, We all had meals and shared(Salmon, Steak, Chicken & Scallops).  The salmon was everyone's favorite.  The main course was very filling.  It wasn't ala carte.  It was a full meal which I thought was a great value.  Deserts were also really good.  The food presentation I thought was also one of the highlights.    The Decor is absolutely amazing in my opinion.  Great concept.  Fun furniture and it works with the concept well.  The service was timely and on point.  The manager came over at the end to thank us for coming in and we all spoke for a few minutes.  It was really nice.  I would definitely go back and recommend others to go as well.    Thank you for a wonderful dining experience.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I have been waiting for the restaurant to open since construction started and were VERY excited to try the restaurant out.  Here's a brief summary:  The decor is VERY on point and quite nicely done.  The menu offers a lot of choices but out waiter wasn't very knowledgeable about the different meals (I get it, it's a new restaurant so this can be forgiven).  The atmosphere is VERY loud (both people noise and music), more bar like than an intimate restaurant setting as is evident by the fact that the majority of the space seems to be the large bar in the center of the restaurant with bar seating all the way around it.  My girlfriend ordered a salad with added pulled chicken, I guessed there was probably only 3oz of chicken on the salad and it was very finely shredded.  Our server did bring an additional side of chicken for her upon our request and the Manager did come over to apologize.  I had the salad nicoise and it was good with a fair amount of Tuna.  My biggest disappointment (beyond how noisy it was) was that the wine menu is EXTREMELY overpriced with a glass of Cabernet ranging from $14 to $18.  This seems rather high compared to similar restaurants in the area.  We will give The Covenant one more try, but I don't see it becoming a regular dining spot for us.",

Funny, not a memorable first impression of the hostess, but not a bad one either.   Anyway, I was seated first and waited for friends to arrive.  The waitress, Ester, was a doll!  Knowledgeable about the menu, and very friendly.   We ordered several appetizers: Brussels Sprouts w/ Andouille sausage, sliders on pretzel buns, grilled cheese with tomato soup (more on this later) and Chorizo cheese dip with focaccia bread.   They have some great drinks with specialty liquors.  My friend and I each got the Meyer Lemon Vodka Cosmopolitan.  Very tasty!  Service was great and Ester had great timing! Now about that grilled cheese and tomato soup.  The grilled cheese was the best I've had!  The bread was buttery and crispy/crunchy and the cheese was delicious - not your typical cheddar/American you normally get.  The soup was atrocious!  I am all about fresh but this tasted liked pureed tomatoes with some basil oil splashed on top.  It didn't even taste good when you dipped your sandwich in it.  In this case I'll take Campbell's Tomato Bisque over that!  All 5 of us thought the soup was like an unseasoned marinara. I had to leave before dessert, but I heard the phyllo and berries and creme brulee were great.   I'll definitely go back, but will ask them to leave off that unpleasant tomato soup!",

    "text": "First impressions are lasting impressions. I am pretty open minded and I think I have a proven record of fair reviews. After returning on several occasions, I feel I can be honest with my review. My first visit was a month after their opening and my girlfriends wanted to surprise me with a birthday dinner. I chalked it up to the usual challenges and struggles of a grand opening. My food was greasy and service was extremely slow. I had ordered the octopus and thought the pairing of chorizo was not a good call. I took comfort in the variety of wine choices and the decor was so bright and cheerful.   Without judgment and exercising fairness, I decided to come back and test out lunch. I had my work lunch here and it was not as packed as the happy hour/dinner crowd. I figured service would be improved which it was to some degree. I went with their salad choices only to sit across my colleague and witness a bug, not tiny either, crawl out of her salad. I get the farm to table appeal but perhaps rewashing the lettuce and greens would be a good idea. The manager apologized profusely and ended up chastising the back staff which was not impressive to me. We did try the poke which was not bad, maybe a little spice would help the flavor. Needless to say, sitting at the bar improved slightly because service was a bit more attentive and quicker.   Recently, I had the pleasure of taking yet another excited patron and finally it was up to par. I am very forgiving as you can see.  The hummus board was a perfect starter and will hold you over. I love how the veggies are grilled within the hummus and the pine nut topping is a winner. The special on this particular Wednesday was half off bottles of wine with an entree so we picked The Prisoner and NY strip. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare; however, it was a bit salty. The sauteed mushrooms and green and white asparagus helped balance that, along with my choice of creme brulee dessert. I think I didn't mind it as much since the company was good and I was distracted with laughter. John was a fantastic server passionate about the food and pleasantly patient with us. I want to seriously crush on you Covenant. I wish I had a 30 second trailer so I could see what I'm getting myself into. I think there needs to be some effort for improvement before you move up from the B team. Don't give up.",

Happy hour had just ended, but we got the brussels sprouts and they were pretty good. They were supposed to have sausage on them, but it was missing, so the server took it off the bill when we mentioned it at the end.  I knew I wanted their chopped salad, so that's what I got. It was pretty tasty, loved all the flavors and ingredients mixing together. I had a few large chunks of the robust bleu cheese so every few bites it would hit me. Absolutely loved that there were dates included, such an underrated fruit that goes great on salads and pizzas. Though it is annoying when paired with bacon. On that note, the menu had a lot of dishes with some sort of pork item in it, so I avoided those. Dressing was good, can't remember what kind it was exactly. I could've had more of the salad or a side of bread to fill me up.  The design of the restaurant is fabulous, open with natural light streaming through the large windows and very much a industrial feel, but gorgeous. We were sitting in one of the booths by the kitchen which was cool. Oh and that yellow door once you exit (because I only noticed it when leaving), LOVED.    Service was okay, our server seemed distracted and preoccupied as we asked for lemons for our waters and didn't get them. We asked other questions that seemed to take a while to get answered too.  Overall, the food was good though a bit on the pricier side. The location is fine, I parked closer to Zoyo but it worked out cuz that's where we went for dessert! *plug*",

There were 5 of us so naturally we ended up ordering 5 bottles of wine with our early dinner. The food was fantastic, I ended up ordering the short ribs and they were full of flavor. The atmosphere was also really cool and put off a really nice vibe. Our waiter took great care of us and our wine glass was rarely empty! We can't wait to come back to this place!!",

Perfect opportunity when I saw on the \"Arizona Restaurant Week\" I made Opentable, Saturday 7:15 reservations for 2. Upon arrival we were greeted and seated right away. The place is large, nice trendy decor, big bar area. Our server Greg introduced himself, very friendly and attentive.  We ordered cocktails while looking of the AZ restaurant week pre-fixed menu for 2. We shared the Shrimp & Crab Ceviche along with both versions of salad, The House and Beet & Goat. Entree's ordered were the Pipian Verde Short Rib and the Ciopino and for dessert we chose the Apple Berry Crostata.  The Arcadia Cosmopolitan was delish along with the Shrimp & Crab appetizer. Believe it or not I've never had beets, so I opted for the Beet & Goat Cheese Salad because as I suspected the other salad was a bit boring, as my friend stated. Both entrees were very good. We were so full that I had ask Greg if we could have the dessert to go without the sweet cream and he was happy to pack it up for me.  I will say, I checked out prices on the menu to what we ordered, a bit pricey. I'm so glad I could try for restaurant week.  Atmosphere: very nice open and trendy, Service: very good, Food: very good",

We arrived a little before 6 and I ordered the Brussels sprouts with andouille sausage on the happy hour menu. The Brussels sprouts I received did not have any sausage. They were tasty, just not what I ordered.   For my entree, I had the chicken romesco sandwich which was actually very good! I liked the side salad it came with, especially the nutty farro and tangy dressing.   We were not too happy about the service we received. Our waitress seemed constantly annoyed and when we needed a refill or had a question about the menu, was often found texting right by the expo window amongst plates of food needing to be delivered.   It should be noted the restaurant decor is on point! Very modern, bright and open.   I may come back for their brunch offerings, and hopefully a different server.",

Everyone was pretty optimistic and pretty excited to try it after seeing pictures online. As we entered the restaurant there was an overwhelming seafood smell.... not the pleasant kind. It was also surprisingly small compared to what we'd seen online. We were seated and reassured three different times that someone would be with us in a moment. After about ten minutes we ordered drinks which seriously DRAGGED. We ordered appetizers and dinner all of which were not that great. The food wasn't awful but it just wasn't worth the price.. at all.  We left pretty disappointed and tabled this place as one we would only return to to strictly grab a drink after work.",

It made the ravioli way too salty and it was also on top of my friend's salad. I would come back but definitely ask for no prosciutto. My friend enjoyed her salad as well and the fries were very good!",

I can't remember what she had, albeit I will attach a photo of it.  She said she thoroughly enjoyed it, though.  As for myself, I had the poke bowl.  (Photo attached.)   Both dishes present well.   I must admit, when it said \"bowl,\" I expected it in a bowl.   No, indeed.   In fact, I like their version much better.    Don't need all that usual filler of rice.    The wontons were, indeed, crispy as advertising.   Just enough fish to make it feel as though I was actually eating fish.   Of course, I like edamame.   And the spices and the drizzle of the aioli sauce were great touches of flavor.  We sat at the bar.   We were told this is the sister restaurant of O.H.S.O.   I didn't know that.   The bartender was very attentive.  I will definitely return.",

Although my whiskey glass was cracked, the expo who cleared the table & retrieved the check was very accommodating towards offering another drink on the house, but since we were on our way out, he wrote up a quick gift card which is the right way to do business.  Liquor: If you're looking for a locally supporting restaurant, in regards to hard liquor & beer, this is your place. They do their very best to support local names in Arizona towards vodka's & other liquors. Yes they have name brand liquors which is my personal preference with a nice modern atmosphere. Pricing on drinks are moderate & fair. They do measure their ounces in their pours, which is good for income, but hit or miss on the return customer.  Food: appetizers were great. Everything was fresh & prepared precisely. We enjoyed crab cakes, octopus, and tuna Tartar. Personal favorite was the octopus which was prepared charred on the grilled then diced into a chilli/potato broth which had great flavor.   Atmosphere/staff: Very nice modern atmosphere & accommodating staff towards answering questions toward the menu. Hats off to the Expo who not only cleared our table, as our waiter hadn't been around for 10 or so minutes & even printed the bill for us, since we were taking off.",

I ordered the kale rustico salad with tiger prawns. The prawns were delicious but the crostini that was added to the salad was so hard, my jaw hurt biting into them.  I took them all out. The server didn't even notice or care nor did he ask how was our food. We spent about $70 for two people for lunch. I probably will not come back for the lack of service and lack of value.

The place is fascinating to behold in daylight; I can only imagine what it's like at night! Our server immediately introduced himself and took our drink orders.  I ordered the Kale Rustico while my husband ordered the Flat Iron Steak. Our proximity to the kitchen allowed us to watch our meals being made. The place wasn't packed at lunch, but the staff remained consistently busy.   I loved my salad. The lemon tahini dressing is fantastic. So many restaurants overdo dressing, but the amount was perfect and the taste was bright. I didn't add any protein, but I found the salad quite filling on its own. Everything about it was excellent.  My husband likewise enjoyed his steak and said he felt satisfyingly full afterward. His plate was sure pretty to behold with its array of roasted vegetables and sliced steak. He's not usually big on adding sauces to his steak--he just wants meat to be meat--but he tried some of the accompanying chimichurri butter and invited me to try it, too. Wow, that stuff was good. I could eat that on all kinds of things.  To finish off our visit were two incidents of great customer care, too. One of the women there--a manager, I am guessing--stopped by to ask how things were at the end. We said it'd been great. She commented that she had noticed I was rubbing my arms a lot when I first arrived so she had turned up the temperature for me. I was VERY thankful for that. I was apparently right under a vent, and I had indeed been quite cold in my first few minutes. I'm grateful for her observational skills!  Also, when we asked for the check because we needed to head out, our server had it back to us in about twenty seconds. That was much appreciated.  In all, this made for a nice date lunch out. I'll remember the Covenant for its food and its great service.",

Ended up ordering vodka and grapefruit - hard to mess that up right? In neither case did he ask if I had a label preference.  Had the chopped salad which was so-so.

We were seated a really comfy and spacious booth by a window (highly recommend the booth). Our waitress was friendly and highly informative about the menu. She was able to answer the few questions we had quickly and confidently. Our water glasses never got below half full and were checked on an appropriate amount throughout the evening.   We ordered the braised beef ravioli and short rib dip. The beef ravioli was the winner between the two dishes. We've had much better short rib dips around town, so we will likely not order this dish again.

First, they have $15 bottomless champagne brunch with your choice of juice on the side....so good! And they are constantly refilling your glass before it ever gets empty....that is impressive.   Next ambience: Very cool vibe inside and giant booths everywhere to accommodate larger parties.   Food: The Poke is literally mouth-watering awesomeness! Sofa King Good! My hubs is a steak and eggs guy (and ridiculously picky) and he loves it there. Good kid options, too. I have had the huevos rancheros, the chicken, the Mexican bowl, and today the Kale Salad with chicken. They were all good except the chicken...it was a little bland and meh. BUT THE KALE SALAD! OMG! Soooooooo delicious! It will now be my order forever.   Service is great, friendly, a teeny smidge slow but not worth losing a star. Love this place...kinda don't want to tell people so I can keep it for myself but that would be selfish.",

The chandeliers are beautiful, industrial style with high ceilings and windows. The bar is gorgeous and right in the middle.   The food never disappoints. It's an open kitchen concept. I got the braised Rib ravioli my fiance got the braised rib dip. SO MUCH FLAVOR and perfect bites! I loved it so much! We got the hummus board as appetizer it's gorgeous and taste great. My fave hummus is True Foods cuz they add a cumin flavor, but this is a close second!   The drink we ordered is called \"Date Night\" it is with Hendricks Gin, Simple Syrup and Kiwi. it's one of the best gin cocktails I've had!   Definitely recommend this place. Their fish of the day never disappoints. Perfect for date night, business lunch, and super trendy!",

The food was tasty but the service was not good, very slow, with almost zero check ins and they were not that busy.  Then my wife founded a hair in her food towards the bottom, then she dug around some more and found another much larger hair in her food.  It took a while to get the attention of the waiter who then got the manager involved.  He was very apologetic and he comped our meals which was very nice.  Then the table next to us overheard our conversation and they told us they had hair in their food too.  Thats a major bummer, the food was tasty up until that point.",

The mimosas are big here!  I had the corned beef hash (one of those dishes I'll pretty much always get if someone has it). The server warned me saying it wasn't traditional which I appreciate. I tried it, and it was so good. It was a little smaller portion than expected for the price so next time I'll just ask for some toast or something.  Anyways, I loved this place. My friend did as well. We will definitely be back soon as we go to brunch every week. I'm so happy this place opened. I can't wait to try this place for happy hour or their dinner menu!",

As I walked in a little late for my reservation, I was met with friendliness from the three hostesses standing at the front and I was seated right away. Make reservations, as it is a busy place!  The tables are close together as they attempt to fit everyone into this vibrant, loud restaurant. You can definitely hear the neighboring conversations. We started with the beet and goat cheese salad which was perfect. I found it difficult to decide on my dinner selection but our server gave great recommendations and descriptions and I ordered the short rib for dinner - and it was fabulous.  My dinner mate ordered the salmon and it was cooked perfectly.  Both meals had beautiful presentations. This is a fun lively place that has awesome service. My only complaint is the limiting dessert menu- three choices is not enough and considering Panna cotta is one - well there is just an untapped market for some delicious desserts.",

    "text": "So last night my husband and I dined at The Covenant Sunday, Oct. 29th, 2017, greeted with great decor and bold colors.We decided to take a seat at the bar since it was date night and sitting at the bar is always more fun! Our bartender wraps up his conversation with the other guest and says a quick hello and gives us two menus and glasses of water. No introduction or information on the space (We found out later that it was 2 months old so he should have been way more excited to have us in explain what the Covenant was all about.) So, we dive into reading the menu and we go over every part. ( I LOVE READING MENUS) After a few minutes, my husband and I decided to try the glass of absent-minded professor with   1/2 roasted chicken and vegetables and the Nicoise salad. The wine was average nothing special and serviced in a very cheap feeling wine glass.  We get our food in a timely manner which was great, or so I thought. Presentation for the chicken was okay but the flavor was terrible, the dark meat was a weird round thing that I have never seen before, the white meat breast was SUPER unflavored it was like they forgot to season the meat.I tried the potatoes which were average potatoes without seasoning and STEAMING hot, then I tried to take a bite of the carrots which were ICE cold, a completely uneven dish. I had to ask for something different because the chicken made me feel as if I was at Boston Market not $19 worthy. So while I waited for the short rib ( the bartender's recommendation )  I tried my husband's salad, it was flavored right but not presented in the typical Nicoise salad with the heavy portions they are supposed to have. The salad had very little tuna on the salad, but none the less average tasting salad. Finally get my new meal and right away I am already seeing uneven knife skills in their \"roasted mirepoix\" there was a very large piece of onion along with uneven cuts of carrots, and celery. I wanted to give it a shot so I dug in, and again everything was unevenly cooked with no seasonings. On one side of my plate the carrots were hard and the other side, they were overcooked and tasted like plastic.  The beef was not seasoned at all it screamed for flavor! The farro risotto was the only thing that was a tiny bit eatable but then again it needed salt and pepper.  After this being a second disappointing dish I told the bartender I couldn't stomach another poorly executed meal. He apologized and took it off the bill but I was incredibly disappointed in this restaurant. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone!! Food is terrible and service was nothing special for the prices.   After writing this and then looking at the yelp reviews and photos it looks like the Nicoise salad is not uniform and extremely uneven portions",

First, a word about the decor: fabulous...as in, I could totally live there. The windows were thrown open, which was wonderful for helping to keep the atmosphere fresh and dissipate the noise (we had a booth on the outside wall, which was perfect).   Service is friendly and welcoming, but a little slow, and our party of four really enjoyed the food. Hubby's bahn mi was fresh with crispy veg and just a touch of spice, my grilled cheese melt was yummy and grease-free (though the tomato \"soup\" was more like a marinara sauce), and our companions loved the chorizo burger. Adult bevvies are pricey, but it's a decent wine list focused on fan favorites and a few interesting choices thrown in.   Yep, we'll be back!",

We went there tonight for a celebratory dinner for my boyfriends first day at his new job. They told us it was going to be 30 min but then two bar seats opened so, yay. Tonight we ordered the melon and feta salad and the slices were like fucking steaks of melons, no easy eating! My first bite had a sticker from one of the melons in it. It wasn't  a huge deal not a finger or something but, I don't want to eat that. Smaller pieces of melons would have been nice but all and all delish. Then we ordered the braised short ribs and received the prime dip, (which looked delicious also but not what we ordered). When the right dish came is was so yummy. We ate it all and the bartender comped us a desert and a glass of wine. Good enough for me! We will be back for brunch now that they have $15 bottomless mimosas!",

Upscale but we'll priced spot for dining and drinks in Paradise Valley, great for locals and worth the drive for everyone else. All the hot-food is made in the wood-fired oven and our meal was on the money. We started with a rum cocktail and the pear cocktail and the charcuterie board. The cocktails we're well balanced and a beautiful start to the meal. The fresh home-made pit bread was great with the board and I couldn't get enough of the home-made sausage. We had the short rib entree and the tomahawk steak with the farm salad. All were delicious and you can't go wrong with the steak but the short ribs really nailed it. We finished with the afogatto and the panacotta paired with some wine and another delicious cocktail. All of this delicious food was followed by courteous and prompt service. We've already picked out our next three meals! Needless to say we highly recommend The Covenant!",

So I passed and ordered a nice Oregon Pinot Gris.  Which was a very nice bottle.  About half way  into the bottle and enjoying a nice charcuterie board.  All of a sudden Brian, the manager, stops by, apologizes for not having the wine ready and chilled and comps our bottle of Pinot Gris and says the Albarino will be chilled and delivered shortly.  Needless to say we stayed longer had more apps and are now customers.  Great first experience and impression. Food was tasty besides the board we had crab cakes and ceviche.",

Katie stood out as a server and should be given as many hours as she is willing to work.  A few thoughts on the menu:  1.  Humus board was exceptional and house made pita bread fantastic. 2.  How about Heitz Cabernet Sauvignon by the glass? 3.  Salads were delicious- especially enjoyed the beet and arugula. 4.  Short ribs were only okay- go across the street to Rusconi's if that's what you are looking for.  Might have been better if they were served hot. 5.  Tomahawk steak was kind of tough and fatty- we will be back to Capital Grille for steak. 6.  If you are serving cappuccino, don't ask if we want sugar- provide a nice sugar cube and a spoon would be good too.  All of the above is offered in the spirit of love- we had a good time and will be back, just a few opening kinks that could be addressed.",

Gorgeous wood floors, beautiful plants outside, great bar in the middle of the restaurant and I love the open concept. Server didn't know much about the menu, but given they had just opened, we didn't think much of it. I liked the look of their wine list - a lot of variety. Food was decent - I do think $17 for a sandwich is a little pricey. It's a little more upscale than I thought it was going to be (great if that's what they were going for!).

I think the owner needs to decide if she wants this place to be upscale or a sports bar as there are 6 tvs over the bar.  There is really nothing special about the food.  Everything is pretty much overpriced expect about $30 per person just for lunch.  The salad we ordered was nothing special and salads are better at sweet tomatoes or any other place.  The prime rib dip we ordered which we were told would be a foot long actually was only 6 inches and again nothing special but rather very boring.  The ladies bathroom had nice wooden doors and cool ceiling but the tile floor makes it dingy and dirty looking. The blue and silver decor inside the dining hall is real nice and different.  We wanted to like it but with a rude waiter plus boring & overpriced food is not a place for us to go back.  It was nice to try.",

My husband and I went on a Tuesday night. I tasted two wines before deciding on one. We had a bruschetta appetizer with goat cheese. It was very sweet and the goat cheese tasted like it may have been whipped with a lighter cream cheese but the waiter said it was just goat cheese. Turned out our waiter did not put our order in right away so after the appetizer we waited a bit and then he came by and said it would be another 5 minutes. I asked for some bread and was so surprised when he said, \"no.\" My husband asked for the check at that point. The waiter then went back to the kitchen, returned to our table, apologized and explained the kitchen was partially at fault and he was partially at fault so he was going to comp us the drinks and appetizer. I'd go back but maybe I'd start with their happy hour and see how things go. It's a relatively pricey restaurant.",

    "text": "Short Story - NEWLY OPENED Gorgeous Glamorous New American Style Restaurant that may be still finding their stride. On my visit one out of three dishes was delicious and technically great! Another dish was ok....and one dish wasn't ready to be on the menu yet. Our server was attentive and the manager made light conversation and was open to criticism.  Longer story -   The Covenant is located in the corner of the Whole Foods Shopping Center and has free valet parking. Inside is very glamorous with chandeliers and artsy mirrors. They have a Charlie Palmer Style Wine Tower in the room and also an open rack of whiskeys on display to wet your whistle. The kitchen is open so you can view the action or the 900 degree wood oven. There are a small amount booths but most of the seating are high top deuce banquets or at the large bar. On my visit the atmosphere was energetic, a bit loud and the air was on the humid side.  We started out by sharing a Melon Feta Salad. The salad was very generous in size. They graciously split the salad in two large bowls. We received a variety of melon, tangy feta, peppery arugula, a little creamy avocado that was dusted with Korean Red Pepper Threads. The salad was more like a fruit cup because it lacked dressing of any kind. I did speak to the manager about this dish and he agreed with me and informed me that the kitchen is coming up with a dressing for this dish that sounds delicious so maybe by tomorrow this dish could be wonderful.  For dinner I wanted to order the fish of the day but I was informed it was already sold out before dinner..............  I went with my second choice and picked the chicken dinner. I received a STUNNING CHICKEN DINNER. Super moist flavorful thigh and breast with GORGEOUS Extra Fancy vegetables they smashed creamy fingerling potatoes and crisped them up. It was a great big serving too....They did a chicken dinner really well.  My husband had what they called the Chef's Cheddar Mac. It was pretty good but my husband wished that the dish had more of the really tasty andouille sausage and he also wished the shrimp weren't over cooked.  I think things will improve rapidly since the manager has an open ear to the customers.  This is a very nice gorgeous restaurant but since it's newly opened it could be a little hit and miss for now.  Great Potential!",

But overall good place, maybe season the veggies with more than only some oil. I like some flavor. Just suggestions! I think management was great. I did speak to management I would recommend this place.",

Very good salad with a light lemon vinaigrette dressing. Nothing overly impressive...HOWEVER...we shared the Braised Beef Ravioli, stuffed with Short rib!  Outstanding!  Not overly saucy and not too heavy either!  Great basil pesto sauce and the short rib is heavenly!  Sorry no pictures...ate it with total disregard to this post!  The bartender who served is was super nice and encouraged us to do this dish.  He does have a man bun but dont hold that against him...he was great!  This is our second time here and we really like this place.  Come check it out!",

Teals and cream and lots of blinging lighting, huge bar with comfy seats and a beautiful glass wine tower with an open kitchen concept. Been eyeing it for the last month waiting for it to open and seeing the chandeliers go up sealed the deal!   The staff was super attentive and nice and most importantly the eggs benedict was in point. The portions are generous-even with my latte...it was huge and yummy.   The menu is simple but looks delicious...will totally be back for dinner for the scallops. On our way out saw some pastries that looked good too-will have to save room next time ;)",

Amir recommended my lunch  - the crabcakes on a bed of vegetables, The Farm salad  and it was way over-the-top delicious.  I eat out a lot and this place won my business and my heart . Great job The Covenant.  Ask for Amir if he's there and tell him Teri sent you.",

The decor is blue, white, gray / silver, and glass -- although the booth was raised & the shortest gal had a hard time. It was worth the giggles, though, seeing her struggle. Does that make me a bad person? :-)  Our server, Craig, was super great: courteous, all smiles, & prompt. The other guy that took our dessert menu seemed a bit brusque, but I won't let  that deter me from the 5 star-rating. The menu isn't extensive -- but it has some fantastic choices (+ an extremely extensive liquor selection. Check out the photos of the food & drinks. Yes, it was a bit pricey but since we were celebrating a birthday & an \"I quit my job after 20 years\" situation, the price wasn't even a consideration. To give you an idea, we order 2 alcoholic drinks, entrees, & desserts; an appetizer & a side. Including a 20% tip, it came to $130. It was a lot of food, too, so the entrees are going to give us a 2nd, perhaps a 3rd meal.",

The pros: the atmosphere is amazing! I loved the bright light coming in the windows and the trendy decor. The food was good too. I wouldn't say great amazing food, but good. Bloody Mary was very tasty!  Cons: our server seemed out of it- I asked if they had sparkling rose' and he said he \"didn't think so\" so I got the previously mentioned Bloody Mary instead. After seeing 3 or so glasses of what appeared to be sparkling rose' go to other tables, I looked more closely at the menu and saw that they do in fact have it. I guess I should have just checked for myself to begin with but I assumed the server would be aware of that info!  I asked for no onions on my order and it came out with onions. My friend ordered the melon and feta salad and it came out without feta (??) so she had to ask for some. My husbands avocado toast was TINY- picture 4 small crostini bread pieces with avocado spread instead of the traditional avocado toast for $12 (or $14 if you add one egg like he did.) just seemed overpriced! Service overall seemed slow as well.   I really had a different idea in my head of what this experience would be and I'm bummed it wasn't what I expected. I'd maybe come back again for happy hour to avoid the high meal prices and I'd sit at the bar to hopefully avoid any delays in service, but even then I'm not sure I'd come back, unfortunately",

The drink menu is full of local beers, there's a wine room that goes up to the ceiling, and the cocktails are varied and delicious. Now as for the food, the emphasis on local and fresh ingredients makes such a difference. You can tell the chefs put a lot of heart into the menu and you can taste the difference. I had the fresh fish of the day which was mahi-mahi and tried my girlfriends braised beef ravioli. They were both amazing. The goat cheese bruschetta appetizer was equally impressive. I figured we'd be boxing some leftovers but we couldn't help but eat every bit. Oops. It's a pricier upscale place, but it's well worth it and great for a special occasion or date night!",

Such a high price for a mediocre meal.  My friends and i were enjoying our girls brunch when someone came up to us and asked us if we could make room for other people by moving to the bar, she added we'd get free desserts as an incentive. So we moved to the bar, got handed dessert menus and ordered. There was 6 of us, we ordered 4 desserts. When it was time to pay they wanted to charge us for all the desserts. We explained that we were told they'd be on the house...mostly because we weren't planning on ordering dessert anyway! The manager came up to us flustered saying she wasn't paying for 7 desserts for us. We were confused and tried to explain the situation to her. Anyway, they still charged us for 2 out of our 4 desserts. It's bad customer service and i will not be back. Its a cute place but i don't appreciate being treated poorly by management.",

They have garage type windows that open to let the beautiful AZ fall weather come thru...its pretty amazing.  The staff is on their game and we were promptly sat and waited on...they have a very creative menu and offer different specials daily.  We ordered and when the food was brought I wasnt sure what they brought me was my order but I dove right in, when the waitress came by to check she said, thats not what you ordered.  She apologized profusely and told me to keep working on it and she would have what I ordered out shortly, well I was kind of glad about the mix up because the meal they brought out was PHENOMENAL!!!  It was halibut with seasonal veggies and roasted brussels sprouts .... I was gifted this and then packaged up my other meal for lunch the next day....SCORE!!!  The waitress did this without hesitation and I greatly appreciated the way she handled it.  It is quite the hike for us but when we find ourselves in that part of town again...you can be sure you will find us there!!!",

Friend brought me here as we were looking for more organic, natural food after a movie. We found it, that's for sure! He had the salmon and veggies, which was a good helping. He said the flavors were all just right. I had the spicy tuna banh mi with side salad. Very delicious although didn't feel too authentically Vietnamese. However they never claimed it was and I'm sure the chef put his/her own twist on it. Very friendly service from Gabby and we appreciated the whole experience. Would recommend for drinks, food, and/or good social time!",

Yum yum in my tum tum.   Overall experience - 5 Love it.  It was a nice afternoon meal with a relaxing environment.   I would highly recommend this place.  And please haters out there... Don't complaint about every little thing.  My first job was at a restaurant. People complaint about the most ridiculous and stupidest things on earth.  Get a life or cook your meal at home.

I was surprised how busy it was for a Monday night.    They seated us in the very back corner near the restroom which made me disappointed.  Thought the reservation and special occasion would have told them to reserve a nicer spot.  Didn't want to ruin the occasion so ignored it.  It took awhile for us to get waited on but she finally came and was friendly.  Not to be snobby, but her attire was unexpected \"plaid casual shirt\", just didn't fit the place.  Oh well whatever.  Service started out good but went down hill rest of our night.  They didn't notice a fork was missing and waited awhile for someone to even walk by looking our way to wave them down while food was getting cold.  Got birthday dessert with no candle and no silverware??????  Again, long wait before we can flag them down.    It's pricey, elegant but service needs some attention to.  Food was good tho!",

Bartenders that don't know how to mix the house specials, lack follow up and follow through and are basically inattentive. The bar is the focal point. You would think they would hire bartenders with basic skills. Others walked with similar complaints. We did enjoy the humus vegetable platter. That was the highlight. Done.",

Ambiance is off the charts including its Staff and wonderfully caring people like Jake (at the coffee bar).  They also have scintillating breakfast items which we found out this am.  Have now lunched here 3x's and the menu is so creative.  You will not find a roasted vegetable & hummus plate (with homemade pita bread) anywhere like The Covenant.  Executive Chef Richard is a quality freak as he surveys EVERY meal before it is delivered by their wonderful Servers. We witnessed him telling our Server that he refused to prepare the daily fresh Ahi as that day's delivery was not up to his standards.  Very refreshing to know that he equally wants to uphold the Brand while protecting the newly minted & coveted Covenant clientele.   Not to be outdone, Chris was a passionate foodie/server & outstanding gent.  Have to love how The Covenant has attracted such talent.  The love for this place just amps higher & higher. A destination appeal while earning its 5 Star stripes.....",

Although we didn't have a reservation and they were quite busy at 7:30 on a Sunday night, the personable hostess accommodated us at a 'family table' in comfy, chairs and good space between us and the other diners at the table. Our waiter was efficient, friendly and pretty well familiar with the menu. I had the outstanding 1/2 grilled chicken with root vegetables and a glass of the house Chardonnay, which was complex and delicious.  My husband had a salad with the addition of grilled scallops.  While good, he said they were unremarkable.  He also had chocolate panna cotta for desert which was very tasty and a little different.  My 'dessert' was a Divine M coffee drink which was served chilled in a small champagne goblet.   Overall, we will be back for sure and I'm certain they will be 5* soon!",

We had some happy hour apps (brussel sprouts and clams) and omg they were amazing! We each had 2 cocktails, a glass of wine, and a coffee cocktail...its date night, it's allowed! :) but a really nice craft cocktail list and wine selection. The butcher steak was lack luster but honestly everything else was so good that it didn't matter. Shout out to the manager Aji.

We had two join us for dinner, cocktails and dessert. If you like bling and great service, this is the place; however, if it's food you're wanting, go elsewhere. Had the octopus appetizer that was cooked fine, but without flavor.  We also had the scallops and \"chorizo chili relleno\". Notice the relleno is in quotes due it falling short of one.  I am undoubtedly a relleno connoisseur.  At best I would label it as a stuffed pepper loaded with potatoes and sprinkled with some chorizo.  Heavy on potatoes, light on the chorizo and lighter yet on flavor. Very disappointed with the lack of flavor and overstuffed with potatoes.  The corn sauce the chili sat in may have better been enhanced with bits of roasted corn kernels throughout. Scallops, cooked to perfection, but again lack of flavor in its sauce.  The roasted vegetables save the dish from total disaster.  Don't think you can mess up roasting veggies. Friends had a salad and sandwich, which they were less than thrilled.  I was told the salad was just that, a plain ordinary salad and the chicken sandwich had great <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fflavor.To&s=e408c8eb5daa8923038f9888d442cfce7eb751feb024ea3e71a11a705657cdc4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">flavor.To</a> prefe  Overall, great smiling service and attentive, hence 3 stars, and of course a comfortable atmosphere.

    "text": "I am sad to be giving this place a less than favorable review as I have been an OHSO regular since they opened in Arcadia; and knowing this is a sister restaraunt, I was excited to see what they had to offer!  Let me start with the positives: the location is great and the inside looks fab. We went during the day on Sunday and I imagine it looks even better at night with all the pretty light fixtures. Our bartender was friendly and our order came out fairly quick. I got the chicken sandwich with a side of the potato wedges which was tasty! Now for the not-so-positives....my boyfriend ordered the ravioli. For $19, we were expecting to be blown away. Unfortunately, it came out drizzled in olive oil and felt undone - I think some type of sauce/seasoning would have helped. The ravioli pieces themselves were half cold. The couple pieces we had that were warm tasted pretty good. We did let the bartender know about this and we're surprised to see he didn't either try to bring us a freshly cooked plate or comp that entree.  While we were there, it appeared to be during a shift change. It was odd that the manager was sitting just a couple seats over from us counting money with some of the waitstaff. I would have expected this to occur in a back office or something. Just felt a little unprofessional for a nice restaraunt.  My hope is that this place is still working out the early kinks as I think it could be a good addition to the neighborhood.",

We had a pleasant server who suggested a grapefruit vodka cocktail which was refreshing and exactly what we wanted. We had a yummy goat cheese and beet bruschetta board for an app, but after seeing our neighboring table with their hummus board I was jealous - will definitely try that interesting take on hummus next time! Dinner for us was a lovely sea bass with Brussels sprouts and a chopped salad with smoked salmon. We split the meals and enjoyed them both. We each commented how we had never had such a unique take on a chopped salad. Overall we enjoyed our entire experience and will be definitely be back!",

    "text": "Tried The Covenant today with my son. I've been in the area for years and have seen the establishment change from business to business several times. Upon driving up I was impressed with the aesthetic of the outside, but was nothing compared to when I walked in the door. I'm by no means a expert of interior design so I wouldn't even know where to begin with the style, all I know is it felt good when I walked in and felt very cool. When I stepped up to the register I was kindly greeted by a friendly gentleman named Jake. Being my first time here I asked what he recommended and he gave his suggestion. Not seeing it on the menu I gave my trust in his judgment and was not disappointed. It's some type of hot chai/mocha/almond milk concoction and MAN! is it good. My son got a hot chocolate and he seemed as satisfied as a kid can get. My curiosity doesn't always lead me to the best of places, but I can assure you I'll be back to try the other offerings that The Covenant has to offer.",

    "text": "My wife and I live in the area and were excited to see a new upscale restaurant coming to the neighborhood.  We frequent another restaurant that's near by that starts with and \"S\" and ends with an \"W\" and were really looking to forward to eating and drinking at The Covenant.  We had such high hopes of this place only to be extremely disappointed.  First of all the decor is very upscale but the noise is extremely loud, I liked that the kitchen is open for the customers to see but we didn't like the food.  We were going to order the charred octopus only to find out that they were out of it.  We ordered the poke tuna which was good and had good flavor.  For our entree my wife was going to get the short ribs but guess what, they are out of that as well so instead got the chef favorite chili relleno which was room temperature when she got it. They took it back and reheated the dish but when she got it back the sauce broke and was still not very hot.  I got the scallops which were very good.  I was also very underwhelmed by the drink selection  they have for their signature cocktails. All very girly and when we had ordered an off drink ( an old fashioned) it was horrible. My wife had ordered an gin martini wi th 3 olives and they forgot the olives in her drink.  Overall this place is very disappointing, but hopefully they will get it together I  the next couple of months.",

    "text": "Went to the Covenant for breakfast. This is a beautiful place. Great vibe. I got the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup. My wife got french toast. The staff was very friendly. I had a Bloody Mary which was yummy. We placed our order and waited, and waited, and waited. Our waitress was very nice to make sure we knew our food would be coming soon. And we waited, and waited. Finally, and we were seriously considering just leaving, our food arrives. My wifes was cold. My grilled cheese has sat long enough so it was warm, but the cheese has already gone solid again. I like my grilled cheese hot and runny. The tomato soup was still \"warm\". My wife told the manager and he quickly took it away, brought back a fresh on, not reheated, and took it off our bill. I didn't make a fuss but told our server my thoughts about the food. She explained they had been open only two weeks and were still working out the kinks. I appreciate that a new place takes time to get their rhythm, but whoever was watching the kitchen should never let cold food out regardless of how long they have been open. It is their main purpose. I gave 3 stars because they seemed to really want to do things right. And even with the food not exactly right, it was really good. If it had been hot I believe it would have been amazing. I will try Covenant again and see how they progressed, but with so many great places to eat in this town and new places opening all the time, I will try again only once before writing it off. I will post an update after I go again.",

The drink menu was meh and the food was good but not GREAT. We started with the octopus, which I enjoyed, but hubby didn't. Then we shared short rib ravioli and the chorizo burger. Both recommended by the waitress as best options on the menu. They were both good but a tad salty. I know this place is newer so perhaps they're still ironing out the kinks but we still prefer Rusconi's across the street.",

Our server, I forget her name, is one that I have had several times and she has always been great. Tonight, however, she had a table of 18 along with several other tables in addition to ours. Consequently our sever sightings were few and far between. My 2 big issues with my dinner tonight were 1) the size of the liquor pours. If you are going to charge $16+ for a drink, it should not be, insultingly, small. It is not as if I was ordering Pappy Van Winkle. Medium priced bourbon, tiny pour. Second, the Chorizo Chili Relleno was completely lacking chorizo. Bottom line it was a potato stuffed chili pepper. Now I have had this here before. It certainly was not like this (or I would have never ordered it again). By the time that our MIA server came back again, everyone, but me, had finished their meals. At this point, I was not about to get something else and have everyone hang around and watch me eat. Just a horrible dining experience. I can't say that I won't ever be back but unlike in the past I will never be the one to suggest it again.",

    "text": "Went for lunch about a week after opening--figured we would let them work out kinks--I am a former restaurant manager with several openings under my belt--I know the drill.  Decor is beautiful, but my husband felt it was too feminine--especially for a place advertising a \"wood-fired 900 degree grill\". Felt it was like a woman's bathroom.  He was expecting a little more of a masculine or at least neutral decor. I loved the decor, and love that their high tables come with a foot rest, but would appreciate more room between them--I don't want to eat with people I did not invite to my lunch.  The restaurant itself was HOT--so much so my husband was sweating at the table and it was not comfortable in there for lunch.  Server was very pleasant but did not know the menu well--by this point I would have expected her too.  Was served half a grilled cheese sandwich and small bowl of soup (menu did not say half sandwich) and while I was fine, anyone with a larger appetite would have gone away hungry. Tomato was sliced too thick and overpowered the sandwich--almost couldn't taste the cheese.  My husband said his burger was very good, fingerling potatoes were just OK.  We ordered water since the wine was a bit pricey for us at lunch.  I WANT to love this place--I really do, as I think PV needs it, so I hope the management is reading the reviews.  Needs: Better AC; more food per plate at the price point (lunch without drinks was just about $40 for 2 with tip), a few wine choices closer to the $10 per glass mark, at least at lunch, a happy hour menu, a few more things that are actually \"wood-fired\" on the grill.  We will try it again, but if things don't improve, it won't become a regular place for us and we were really hoping it would.  We live close and would like to make it a regular stop.",

You need to revise your menu with better items (pizza and ribs are good for 900 degrees) and reduce pricing on drinks and food soon or you will be going the way of the dinosaur quicker than you think. It's early enough to make these changes and win back a big portion of customers but I have a feeling your rent was so high due to the TI you did and your margins are barely clearing.",

I have been to many restaurants a lot nicer than this one and they have always accommodated for me and don't worry about the chef's presentation. I asked him to please check with the chef or I would like a manager and he came back 5 minutes later and was able to bring me cucumbers. Then my friend I was with ordered the grilled cheese and asked for no bacon he made a joke of extra bacon and when our food finally arrived it did indeed have extra bacon on it, so we had to wait while they remade it. The place has great potential but seeing the service was not welcoming made it a very unpleasant experience.",

The banquette seating was so close we felt we had to converse with the neighboring tables and whisper if we wanted to discuss anything personal.  Wait!  Couldn't whisper because the noise level was so loud we could barely hear each other with inside voices.  It was also so hot that sweat was running down our face and neck.  Maybe the sweat was what attracted the flys.  Very limited and expensive wine by the glass selection.  I had the scallops and was surprised at the generous portion (5).  They were accompanied with roasted carrots (4), brussel sprout (1/2), and 1 broccoli flowerette. The scallops were served with a light sauce which served as a little swimming pool for the polenta, which was soggy. The price wasn't bad @$29 but the quality was mediocre at best.  At 6 pm we were out the door, so one hour of just ok dining at $60. plus for one including just 1 glass of wine and tips, earned this my 2 star review.",
