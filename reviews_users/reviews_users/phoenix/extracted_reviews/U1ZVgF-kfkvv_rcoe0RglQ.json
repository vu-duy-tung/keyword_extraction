The broth they make for the pho is so delicious and flavorful, I sip it on its own when no one is looking. The beef is very tender and soft, and the noodles are perfect. I've also tried their avocado smoothie and while it could have been blended better (had a couple chunks stick in my straw) it had great flavor and was not too sweet.  My roommate and I love walking to local restaurants and this is definitely one we will be coming back to.",

For dinner my husband got a house stir-fried noodle dish that had vegetables, shrimp, beef & chicken.  I felt like Pho so I ordered #22 Noodle with rare steak flank, tenderloin, tripe & meat balls. I'll be completely honest with you regarding the pho it had the best broth I've ever had. I've tried several places around the valley that have high ratings for authentic pho and this place beat them all. We also enjoyed a Thai tea with boba it was the perfect accompaniment to complete our meal. The owners of the restaurant are very kind,  courteous and genuinely appreciated our business. Right now they have a grand opening special 10% off your bill. Go try them out today and I know you won't be disappointed.",

They will tell you over the phone that your order will be ready in 10-15 minutes you will get there and you will have to wait an additional 20-30 minutes. One time I had to wait 1 hour for my take out order! The employees just kept telling me \"5 more minutes is coming out\" I was furious and even told them to cancel it after I saw they kept serving people who came after me. At the end, they figured out they lost my order ticket! Did they give me a discount or apology ? No, I wish. Today I order take out again (you think I would of learn my lesson) I get there at the time it should of been ready. I pay and then they say that my iced tai tea is not ready and they make me wait 30 minutes for the tea!!!! Can you believe it, the service is ridiculously outrageous And unorganized. The food is good but today they have lost my business and I'll never recommend this place to anyone. I gave them several chances thinking it was a one time hiccup but noooo they just suck at service.",

    "text": "Was in town visiting from Cali and craving Pho. A local recommended this place and I went for it.  I had to come back two times. The first, I requested a table for one 30 minutes before closing and the gentleman said they rather not serve me anymore since they were closing soon.  He wasn't rude or anything but his response took me by surprise. The place wasn't busy at all.   I came back the next day since I was craving but got to-go. The trip didn't take long but when I was back the broth was cold.  There wasn't any jalapeno as I've seen in their pictures. They hadn't included the spicy sauce as well.   The broth was good which is typically what most Pho places miss, but just the lack of service is the reason for the 3 stars. I wish I wouldn't have had to take two trips just to satisfy my craving.",

    "text": "Decent food, but terrible service. We came here because the pho restaurants we normally go to in downtown were closed, but my experience at Pho Noodles did not live up to my expectations.    For starters, they did not know how to seat people (they seated a party of 2 at a 4-person table when there was a 2-person table open, so that larger parties were unable to be seated). Plus, they small restaurant with no waiting area, so people have to wait basically hovering over people while they eat. Also, as I was having dinner, there was a line of people waiting for their \"To Go\" food and almost all of the customers had to wait 25+ minutes to receive their food, constantly reminding them that they were waiting for carry out orders.   Food-wise, the BBQ pork Banh mi lacked meat and I could mainly taste bread. Their Pho Tai was good, but nothing stellar. And their boba was a little over cooked, so it didn't have that chewy consistency that boba normally has.   Overall, we had to wait a very long time to be seated and then again to order and then receive food. I wouldn't have a huge issue with this if the meal seemed worth it, but I wasn't very impressed by what we received. I don't plan to return here the next time I am craving a warm bowl of pho.",

    "text": "As a big fanatic of pho I have tried virtually all the local haunts and while some miss the mark Pho Noodles makes a decent bowl of soup!  Generally, the soup here is consistent, with a flavor profile that leans toward a heavier anise (?? Perhaps a bit heavier on the five spice?? Cannot pinpoint the exact flavor!) which is, to me, their uniqueness. I like their Thai Tea and Boba drink offerings as well. Looking forward to trying more of their menu. NOTE: I am compelled to offer some knowledge to those who claim to enjoy Pho, but appear to have no idea how it is made! I see a number of \"low star\" reviews by those who have ordered Pho to go and are confused and put off by the meat being \"raw\".  I urge you to search for an authentic Pho recipe! You will be surprised to discover virtually all of the soup is prepared with raw beef, placed in a bowl with cold noodles and the veggies.  The hot broth is then poured in the bowl heating the veggies and noodles and poaching or \"cooking\" the beef right in the bowl! (Please adjust all unfair reviews!! ;o) Thanks for listening!",

The noodles (Bon) were also thinner than I like in this soup, but were still good.  The taste was ok.  3.5 stars for the Bon Bo Hue. ________  The more I eat Ramen, the less I like Pho.  I'm just not sure why that is.  But I was pleasantly surprised to find this Vietnamese restaurant while passing through Midtown.  Conveniently located at Osborn and 7th Ave in the Safeway parking lot. It is easy to get to and there is plenty of parking in this \"Off-Central Ave\" midown location.  This restaruant opened in a hostile environment.  There are no less than 3 very good contenders for the best Pho in Phoenix within about 3-5 miles.  For me, this place has the best tasting broth and the ingredients were fresh and delicious.  The broth had the right complex depth of taste that you get from the long process it takes to make it.  Their broth is A-1!  I had a nice bowl of Pho with everything in it.  I also tried their banh xeo.  I enjoyed both dishes a lot.  The bahn xeo was a little bit greasy, but it was very tasty.   The Bahn xeo is large, I would advise planning on sharing it if you are ordering a main course.  The staff was very gracious when we had an order mix-up.  I appreciated them replacing our spring rolls with eggrolls.   Return Factor: 90%",

The nuoc mam (fish sauce with sugar, garlic, chili, and lime) was perfect and complimented the pork well. The pork and shrimp spring rolls are authentic; novice, non-Vietnamese patrons may think the spring rolls itself are kind of bland, which they're supposed to be. The pork and shrimp are usually boiled in water. That's it. The spring roll is supposed to have a subtle, yet fresh flavor. The stronger, bolder flavored peanut sauce is what brings it all together. Even the decor is what I'd find in my grandmas house. Pretty legit. Will come back.",

The sandwich was on awesome crispy and chewy bread, the tofu was cooked perfectly, and the toppings were awesome with enough sauce so that it was not dry. The soup was incredibly flavorful, I could taste all the spices, particularly star anise. The soup came with a huge takeout box filled with tons of glass noodles, lime, veggies, and a small amount of the two pho sauces. It is a ton of food. Tastes so, so good. Love that they open at 9am. I'll definitely order from here again, SOON.",

Tonight, not only were we served with Pho Noodles, we were witnesses to disorderly conduct that took place in the kitchen. This is a small restaurant, so when a disturbance occurs in the kitchen, you can hear all of its glory. An older woman was screaming at an older man in the kitchen. We also heard several thuds coming from the kitchen. A concerned customer opened the swinging door to stop the disturbance to see a man trapped against a wall being screamed at by an angry woman who appeared to be the owner. The customer who had two small children with him asked the screaming woman to stop her screaming. This angered the woman, and she began approaching the customer as if she was going to assault him. The customer threatened to call the police, and the poor server at the counter begged him not to call the police. It was the most awkward restaurant experience I have ever encountered. I'm not sure what the argument entailed between the man and the woman in the kitchen, but it was certainly not the time or place for the argument to occur in front of at least 15 seated customers.",

Tucked away in a crappy little strip center on the northeast corner of 7th Ave and Osborn, this spot has become THE vietnamese spot for all central Phoenix residents. With the underwhelming return of Rice Paper, which is not only 10x more expensive than Pho Noodles, but 10x worse (see my review) Pho Noodles uses the perfect sized noodles in their Pho, they have amazing fresh spring rolls, and is 100% legit. Not a word of english is spoken in this restaurant, which i love, it is always busy, and the prices are great. We ordered takeout the other night, 3 chicken pho, 4 spring rolls, 1 fried roll was about $35.....At rice paper it is $14 for 1 average bowl of pho....I highly recommend this spot.",

It comes broken down into separate section, and you combine it. SOOO AMAZING!!!   The PHO's are the best in the area. I spent every Sunday going around the area trying other Pho's. They had the best broth hands down!!  Go In! Won't be disappointed....   Marc",

I'm also a big fan of the broken rice with pork chop. The rice is perfectly cooked, the pork chop is generous, tender and well seasoned and the veggies are always fresh.  The bahn xeo is good, but always takes a while to make. Even if you order as an appetizer, it comes out after the pho.  One star gets knocked off for the service - it's always haphazard. I've never seen the same wait staff more than once and the service is nothing to write home about.",

Really glad I did, because Pho Noodles really hit the spot.  The staff seem nice and courteous and for a Wednesday, it was pretty packed at around 6pm.   Started off with a couple spring rolls which were delicious and not too greasy.  For my main meal I had the 22. Pho Tai Nam / Rice Noodles with Rare Steak, Well Diced Flank, Tendon, Tripe, Meatballs. Luckily there was some Sriracha and sliced jalapenos included, though I could have used more. The spicier the better.  The only thing preventing a 5 star review was the 58. Taro - Fresh Boba Slushy. The boba was still hard and it just didn't taste good. I'll stick with SNOW or Bosa for Boba drinks I guess.",

    "text": "Charming little strip mall restaurant. Young staff, attentive service.  Pho was good. The broth was pleasingly sweeter and a bit more spiced than the local competitors. Spring rolls were good.   Nothing glaring, but two, errr make that three main exceptions to (what I'd guess and have heard are relatives) the competition.  1.) no garlic chili paste (my ultimate favorite condiment). Yes they have sambal oelek. They have Sriracha. But not the dried chili flakes and chopped roasted garlic in oil. The dark, savory, spicy and sweet paste that makes my meal.  2.) compared to their local competition, the prices are higher. I won't speculate but there are numerous likely reasons for this.  3.) every time I go pho, I pleasantly have nearly half my bowl for the next day. I noticed that here, versus the traditional competition that typically after refrigeration, there is a noticeable coagulation of the broth. Which means, high quality bone broth...the basis in pho. Quite unfortunately that was not the case here which leads me to believe that more sugar and spice does not equal the pho is nice...  I'd return, but it's not my first or even second choice.",

The service is a tad lacking but it's likely due to being a new restaurant. Glad this place is in the hood. Good food.   Update:   The experience has lowered my rating. First, they continually mess up our order and then they ran a $60 charge on my CC for a $37 meal. Normally not a problem except that the experience also involved the gentleman who works there disciplining my 4 year old child. If you have children, find a more kid friendly restaurant unless you want the staff to get upset with your kid, for being a kid. This was our last visit here. Time for a new Pho place.",

The prices are very reasonable, if not a little cheaper than their local competitors and the place is bright, clean, and inviting. This little family run spot has some of the best pho broth I've had. The spices come through without being overpowering and of course all the add-ins are there for you to make it just the way you like. They have a very nice selection of other food options as well, including fried or soft noodle bowls, appetizers, and Vietnamese, Thai, and Boba drinks. Portion sizes are really BIG, so plan on taking home leftovers or sharing unless you don't mind leaving behind a lot of goodness.  The service is amazingly fast and friendly. They are attentive without hovering which is always a hard balance to strike. I highly recommend this place if you are in the neighborhood and they offer take-out if you would rather eat at home.  I will adjust stars after a few more visits but this place is on its way to a Pho'nomenal five stars if they keep this up!!",

First of all, although there are a myriad of Vietnamese options in the Phoenix area, it's refreshing to find a new restaurant that has a friendly, warm, welcoming staff as well as a nice, clean interior. A lot of the pho \"go-tos\" around the downtown area are in old, shabby buildings (sometimes with no air conditioning) and are sometimes staffed by waiters who seem impatient or unfriendly. Not here! We felt welcomed and comfortable the whole time, which makes Pho Noodles a diamond in the rough.  As for the food--wow! It's some of the best pho I've tried in the valley (and I've had a lot)! Authentic pho, with a deep, hearty, extremely flavorful broth, good portions of tender meat, and springy, tasty noodles: it was just right! All of their ingredients seem fresh and care is put into their food. I absolutely recommend, and this will be one of my regular spots to get pho now! Can't wait to try their other Vietnamese dishes, too!  (My only slight complaint is that the Vietnamese iced coffee tasted a little too sweet and syrupy, but that could just be preference!) Kudos to you, Pho Noodles!",

We have since been there together multiple times and always are happy that we went. I like their chicken banh mi sandwich a lot, it's very good. Last time I ordered the egg rolls as well, they were really good! I bounce between the beef pho and the bun bao xao, it sometimes is very difficult to choose! Their prices are very reasonable for what you get, and we are never hungry after eating here. I prefer to take out because the restaurant is rather small and is usually very busy. We usually walk in and order and then go next door to Safeway to grab our groceries that we forgot to buy at Sprouts. Our food is always ready by the time we walk back. Definitely would recommend, despite its location in a strip mall it is very authentic and a great bang for your buck!",

I got there around 10am and it was nice that they open so early.  The place had about 10 tables and it was fairly clean.  I ordered the following:  Beef, tripe and tendon pho ($7): awesome!!! the savory soup was tasty (not overpowering of star anise) with lots of meat and noodle.    Grilled porkball spring roll ($3.25): it came with two pieces filled with crispy egg roll skin, lettuce, pickled carrots, rice noodles and sliced porkball.    I will definitely keep this place bookmarked on my profile.",

Thanks to Yelp we said \"Let's just chance it and try it out for ourselves!\" and you know what, it was really good.  I love the egg rolls it was a small dish but, it was delicious...I love eating it with all the fixings it's so delicious and I love their pho. The customer service though is mehh we had to waive someone down for water service and our check. But, the food here is delicious",

The bad: Bread was cold and not toasted enough, I work off thomas and central so it should be warm still by the time I get back to the office.  Mayonnaise is a poor substitute for pate. No jalapenos in the sandwich (a staple in banh mi). Vietnamese iced coffee had creamer in it (almost blasphemy).  I will say, the pho was relatively good from what I can remember so stick to their soup based and rice dishes.  Overall, probably won't come back. Too much against and not enough for from my experience.",

They do give you really small portions of meat in the pho so the meat is all gone with a lot of noodle left.  When I ordered an extra beef meatballs (bo vien) on the side, the kitchen had forgotten to make the order and I did not get it until after I finished my pho, after I reminded them.  Also it was one beef meatball sliced into 4 pieces and they charged me $2 for it.  lol.  Talk about being overcharged here for small portions of meat.  Other than that, the quality of the meat in the pho was good.  The staff here consistently have problems getting the order right even though they are nice.  Be warned.",

Anyway, my main complaint is about this restaurant's service. It's always slow, no matter what time of day it is. The last time my family and I were there the place was mostly empty, yet it took awhile for someone to hand us a menu. After waiting for a few more minutes the waiter served us glasses of water. All of us took a sip and grimaced at the taste. There was a plasticky taste to it; either they didn't wash the cups properly or the water container. The waiter looked annoyed and incredulous when we told him we wanted another batch. Eventually, with great reluctance, he took our glasses back to the kitchen. We were all taken aback by his attitude. The waiter came back with supposedly new glasses of water, but it tasted the same. Ugh.   I decided after this incident that I'm better off going somewhere else. There are other better pho places in Phoenix, like Da Vang. The food there is always excellent, and the waiters there are quite friendly and won't give you any attitude.",

A big bowl of soup is $7! You can't even get a McDonald's meal with 7 bucks any more. Highly recommend you stopping by!!",

However the service is nice and professional-not necessary for a Pho place in my opinion. I like to be in and out quick like at Pho Thanh and Da Vang.  The portion is big which justify the price.  I do have a critique on the atmosphere and the lightning. When i was there it was sad. Maybe I was alone and it had been raining that day and I was lonely. Play some music and open the window cause I can hear all the chatter around me.  I will be back another time to give it another swing.  BTW water should comes with the menu every time. Bam bam bam.

The atmosphere is pretty usual for a small restaurant like this but it's quaint and clean. The service is out of this world. I mean every time we come they remember us, our order and always serve with a smile. Super quick. I can't say enough about this place. You have got to try it. We have tried many places but nothing has topped this place! Come and try and you'll leave with a smile and will love the service! Most everyone that comes in is a regular. You've gotta come!",

Broth was on the saltier side - indicating MSG and not enough time cooking the actual broth. It's probably the way they cater to all the customers.. this place was popping at 4pm and plenty walked in for to-go orders. We also ordered the grilled pork rice.. more like steak version, with bone and not traditional grilled pork plate I'm used to.   This place is decent but I'd explore the other pho places too.",

If your a vegetarian, seafood or meat eater you will find something here. Today I ordered the Chicken Soup and my friend ordered Teriyaki Chicken. My soup was served fast while pipping hot. Had all the vegetable fixins with it. The broth was amazingly flavored. I dipped my fork into my friends platter and let's say I am ordering that when I come back. The sauce on the Teriyaki Chicken has a hint of something to give it a nice kick.   Price point was perfect for every budget. My soup was $6.95 and my friends order was part of the lunch special for $9.95. Which included rice and steamed veggies that came with the Teriyaki Chicken.   The staff was very welcoming and friendly. Service with a big smile.",

Well, they were very friendly and accommodating. We ended up dining in, and getting appetizers and drinks, plus they offered to pack up our leftover soup to go.  Very happy this place is so close to home. Will definitely be going back for good food, service and prices!",

Compared to my favorite places in Seattle, this place is very good. They use all fresh ingredients, make their dishes without an excessive amount of oil and lastly, their customer service is fantastic.   Compared to every other pho place I've been to in Phoenix, this place kicks ass.   I would strongly recommend this place to anyone in the mood for killer pho.",

The broth isn't to powerful or to plain, it's just right. The portion of noodles is just right, I suggest trying it with egg noodles. That's my favorite. Don't plan on finding a seat right away during lunch, it gets busy. Therefore, get take out or come in a little earlier than 12pm.",

    "text": "Pho Noodles has become my latest addiction. They are quick, friendly, affordable, and scrumptious. What else does one need? I regularly get #22 or #25 because I LOVE tripe. Call me crazy, but it's a texture thing. Unlike similar Vietnamese restaurants in the area, they don't skimp on the ingredients that make pho fun to eat. They also have mean vegetarian pho options and they load in the bok choy. Plenty of parking available as well, which is just the icing on the cake. 5 stars from me!!",

    "text": "I have to preface this review by stating that I work in Downtown Phoenix, and its been a struggle to find a solid, tasty, quick, relatively close pho place over the past three years. Me and a coworker had a monstrous craving for pho, and I decided I'd ask the Yelp Gods for help finding somewhere to go.  I'm not sure how I missed this place before. I'm not sure how long they've been open. I'm not sure how my life ever felt complete without coming here once a week for some grub.  It's a relatively small spot with a few 2 and 4 person tables. The staff greets you and helps you find a seat immediately, which is surprising given how busy they are during the lunch hour. When it comes to pho, I generally know what I want (easy rare pho, which is #23 at Pho Noodles, and some thai tea) and they are always quick to ask what I want. You know whats crazy, though? They're even quicker to bring out your food, which is fantastic when you're on a one hour lunch break and have to rush back to the office for a meeting.  I suppose I should talk more about the food? The pho is ridiculously good. It's hard to explain, because its not necessarily the *best* pho I've ever had, but it's exactly what I'm looking for, at the perfect price point, and the perfect location.  When me and my pho-loving homegurl coworker leave, our bill is about $22 for two bowls and two teas. Doesn't get much better than that.",

Initially we weren't welcomed in, as soon as we took our seats they proceeded to ask, \"are you ready to order\" I ordered fried rice but it was sticky rice with fried vegetables, so it was not what I ordered. I nicely said I don't want this. The manager came to the table and was very rude to me. Then had the audacity to ask if I wanted anything from the menu. To reiterate, I kindly rejected what they served me. My friend ordered the Pho with beef. The Pho was undeniably old. It was too chewy. The portion of the pho was minimal. The bathroom was dirty. The only explanation why I'm reviewing this place with my 1star is that the table was clean and the water was always topped off.",

Reasonably priced as well, less than $10 per bowl, which is exceptional. Owner or manager is very nice and ready to answer any question you have. If we're ever in the area again, we'll definitely come back here.",

I eat Pho Tai at least once an week during the colder months, my go-to place has been Moto simply because it's close to home, I'm lazy, and I typically do take out on the way home from work.    Pho Noodles opened my eye's to what inferior Pho I have been settling for!!   This place is still not far from home, and the broth is DELICIOUS, the fixings were fresh, and damn, it just tasted soooo much better.  I was definitely settling by not wanting to venture too far west for some of the other authentic options.  Parking was convenient and the place looked clean.  No longer must I settle for subpar Pho!",

The restaurant is a bit more modern than other nearby Vietnamese restautants. They offer a good variety of Vietnamese foods, way more than just pho. Having just visited Vietnam, I wanted to try something I had eaten there and ordered the bun bo hue. It was tasty and spicy. The meat in it was not as good as it was in Vietnam, but the broth was on point. My dining companion had the pho, and it was tasty as well. Next time I visit I want to try the bun xeo, which is something they don't serve everywhere. The prices here  are higher than the older places by a few dollars per dish. I think if I were getting take out, I'd for sure get my fave Vietnamese (da vang), but if I were eating in the restaurant, I would come here.",

Now, we did receive a 10% discount but that's only a few bucks in savings (appreciative of the discount though).   The shrimp spring rolls were light and delicious. I don't like peanut sauce so I dipped them in tamari and ponzu.  The egg rolls were very good! I'm not a big egg roll because their usually greasy and heavy, but these are light and full of flavor.   My husband and I both ordered the #24 which is Pho with steak. The broth is bold and has a refreshing ginger taste. The steak is good, but was under seasoned. With the cilantro, Thai basil, scallions, chili paste and broth, the lack of flavoring in the steak is most certainly not a deal breaker.   Right now, they are offering 10% of the entire bill.   If you haven't tried this place and are looking for a yummy, inexpensive meal check this place out and support a local business.",

Although the area does not have a shortage of other Asian restaurants, people in the area usually had to go farther into the west side or to north Phoenix to get good Vietnamese food. This restaurant is cozy, very clean, and conveniently located in the commercial complex at the northeast corner of 7th Avenue and Osborn. The staff is friendly and the food is inexpensive and really good. The other reviewers have already discussed how good their pho is, so let me just mention that I love their crispy banh xeo, which is a must-try for people who want something a bit different from the usual noodle or rice dishes. And their Vietnamese rolls are really good, especially the ones with tofu and vegetables - the ingredients are really fresh and the rice-paper wrapper is tender and not rubbery, unlike in some Vietnamese eateries.",

Very common thing to do when ordering at Vietnamese restaurants in the OC (Vietnamese Culinary Mecca). So it was a pleasant surprise when I took my first bite.  Even though I'm Vietnamese, I'm not a big fan of pho. I was hoping they would have a large menu outside of Com (broken rice), Banh Mi, and noodle soups outside of Pho, like Bun Bo Hue, Bun Rieu, or Mi. No biggie because their broth was delicious and they are a new restaurant. I had talked to one of the employees about the menu expansion. They seek to do so in the future, so I'm excited.  I would definitely come back here again with my Vietnamese folks for lunch or with friends when seeking a hangover remedy.. Haha. It's nice that they are open on Tuesday's because Pho Thanh and Da Vang would be closed. For whatever reason I crave Vietnamese food when they're not open.  Thanks Pho Noodles!",

They have a new server, Armando- who is great and the food is on par to match. They have actually updated the menu, and now have pork meatball fresh rolls with the crunchy piece in the middle, and I'm loving the Saigon crepe (which isn't a new addition but tasted extra good today!! Try out this place if you like good prices and Vietnamese food   So I've been here 5+ times and would rate them 3.5 stars. The pho is good but not the best, large portions and inexpensive- as pho should be! Love the spring rolls here and you get 2 for under $3. Mainly, my husband and I come here because you get your food really fast and it is inexpensive! The egg rolls are small but cooked fresh and also inexpensive. The sandwiches are $4 and although more bread than meat, the bread is fresh baked and very tasty. My pet peeve is the service here. All the younger Vietnamese(?) staff are very friendly and attentive, but there is one taller, older non-Asian gentleman that works there, and whenever he is working you can just tell everyone else working there feels uncomfortable. He is rude to guests and has consistently got my or husbands, or other patron's order wrong and doesn't admit his wrong, apologize or adjust the bill. When he is working, I will no longer go back in there. His lack of customer service and rude attitude ruins the dtphx neighborhood pho place!!",

Expect to ask for water,  your food, to have them wipe down tables (usually with dirty rags), and for clean silverware that is not kept in dirty glassware at the tables. Once you look past all that, the food is awesome!",

    "text": "Bummer having to write this review, but we feel it's necessary. We are pho-fanatics & eat it everywhere we travel. We're by no means pho-snobs, though, and appreciate different variations. This pho was boring, there wasn't much meat, and the tendon (my favorite cut in most bowls) was rock hard & tasteless. The bean sprouts were questionably fresh. The shrimp/pork spring rolls came out & the stench of the not-too-fresh shrimp was strong enough to smell from the other side of the table. Lastly, the hot tea came out, was lukewarm, and the water they used was not clean tasting. Now, the staff was friendly, and the service was okay, so we hate to slam the place. Just wouldn't recommend this restaurant at all, and wish the Yelp reviews had swayed us to go somewhere else.",

Whenever I start to feel like I'm getting a cold, I head straight to Pho Noodles and double down on the broth. The service is great and the staff is most kind.",
