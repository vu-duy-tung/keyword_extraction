    "text": "Lovely patio on Mill avenue with a great craft beer selection and interesting food. Beers run about $6 with $1 off at happy hour and burritos are around $9. You can take any burrito item and make it a taco- interesting twist. My boyfriend got the green chili pork mac and cheese and really enjoyed it. I stuck with the appetizer bean burrito which was more than enough! Ask for the free chips and salsa with purchase of a beverage. I thought it was funny that 10 taco items are strictly sold at Wednesday taco time and not the entire time? Maybe place it on a separate menu so it's not as confusing?",

    "text": "Casa sunba is a unique location and concept.  It takes a lot of guts to have a outdoor restaurant serving lunch in Tempe in the summer.  There is also a indoor area with a concert venue however during my lunch visit it wasn't open so that will be another review. First of all the beer selection is pretty decent with several varieties on tap.  There is also a full bar.  Even though this is a outdoor only place, the abundance of misters and fans keep it pleasant out.  The food is also where the uniqueness of this place really shines.  The majority of the choices are burritos but definitely not the normal kind.  Mac and cheese, fried chicken dinner and Chinese takeout are some of the options.  I had the BBQ chicken dinner burrito as it was the special of the day and although it was good it did suffer slightly by the mac and cheese and cole slaw in the burrito taking a lot more real estate then the chicken and really overpowering it.  My son was joining me for this trip and he had the vegan steak burrito and it was excellent.  I don't know what they are using for their steak substitute but it is amazing, it tastes and feels exactly like real meat and has a delicious flavor. The service while adequate was somewhat lacking but I think this was mostly because the bar was only staffed by one bartender and she seemed to be having a hard time keeping up with a busy lunch hour.  All in all a decent place with a unique concept that I will be trying again.",

There's no bathrooms, people are over served, but the drinks aren't that expensive and there's a cool patio upstairs. It's just really really dirty and the crowd is annoying!",

I always try to give it the benefit of the doubt thinking that they have GOT to have things figured out by now, but I am always wrong. Always.   Shall I explain why? Oh ok, if you insist.   One of the first times I was there, I ordered a salad. Waited 10 min for silverware. 2 of the MAIN ingredients were not present (pomegranates and avocado) . When I asked why they said they were out of pomegranates, and didn't know why the avocado wasn't on it. So they bring me the avocado, and might I add that it was 10 minutes AFTER I finished the wimpy salad. When I get my bill, guess what I was charged for...A SIDE OF AVOCADO. I voiced my issues to my server, and then never saw him again. Then drinks took forever, when it was not even busy. I just had it. I have never been so baffled with the service at a restaurant so I asked to speak to the manager just simply to tell him how things were going so he was aware of how things were being handled. Let's just say he wasn't good with constructive confrontation.   Went there the other day and had the same lousy experience. BUT I do want to say that our server JAMILA was really nice and on top of things for our table.   Just a few side notes of things that surprised me.   1. 3 dollars for ROX.  2. Signage of deals for the day/hour are not clear.  3. The amount of ice they crush into the glass is very overwhelming. We ordered the buckets and it was all ice! I was bummed with how much of a buzz I didn't experience.",

    "text": "OMG where to even begin... This will be an interesting review to whoever interested...  Fiance and I arrive at around 8pm yesterday (Sunday). Guy who carded us was nice and friendly- said to get a table we would have to go upstairs...as the entire area downstairs was occupied by nasty, and I mean nasty girls giving lap dances to strangers most likely (seen this all before lol). So off we go upstairs. All we really wanted was a quick dinner and a drink or two.  Took a table and realized after 5-7 minutes that getting service was going to be a hassle... Idiots working here apparently. Finally we were acknowledged, ordered two burritos, the Chinese takeout and some pork with Mac n cheese burrito. The food was the only positive about this place. Got two drinks as well.  Food arrives... No silverware.. No napkins.. Ummmm we are eating burritos???? Fiance goes up and asks if she has silverware. All she says is \"Nope.\" Ummm how about you go get some?? Why this place hires apparently incompetent people is beyond me. Btw, this girl has the haircut to her shoulders with the half top knot on her head. Yeah, best interest to let this one go.. Maybe she was drunk is all we could come up with. Never got silverware.  We're about finished with dinner and a couple walks up to our table. The guy straight up asks us if we want to buy cocaine. Fiance responds with a simple, \"Not a good idea buddy, I have a DEA license.\" Guy gets scared and says don't say anything. Fiance has to walk to the bar to get the check from the worst waitress we've ever experienced, finally gets it, and we're about ready to go. Cocaine guy says, \"would you be mad if your girlfriend made out with mine?\" That was our cue to leave so that's what we did.   This place is suchhhhhhh a joke, it's almost laughable. Our waitress didn't give a sh*t, good luck with a real job if you can't even handle that one sweetheart. The place is filled with low lives. What a joke! Glad we got out of there and we WONT EVER be back. I'll make sure to tell all my friends and family as well. Disgusting",

I ordered the pulled pork burrito and it came with mac n cheese and potato salad inside. This was one of the best things I have ever eaten. My friend ordered the thanksgiving dinner burrito with stuffing cranberry sauce mashed potatoes and turkey with gravy on the side also one of the most delicious things. I am glad I got to split these because they were both so good and one burrito is plenty for one person. I loved the atmosphere and music. The waitress was nice.

    "text": "C.A.S.A. how I have tried to like you. I would say I've been there 30+ times and certainly more than that if you consider it's previous life as Chronic Taco (same owner, same problems). For the purpose of this review I will stick to the outside bar since that is where I have spent of the majority of my time.   I will start out with the one positive that the food here is fairly decent for inexpensive bar food. They have a creative twist on several entrees that make it worth the occasional stop in.   Location-wise the sun makes it difficult to enjoy this place year around and it can be down right blinding during sunset. Location isn't what really kills this place though. It is the lack of any operational savvy by the management team and disengaged owner. I certainly see Scotty there fairly often but he never seems very interested in anyone other then his friends. I often joke when I get dragged here that they will certainly mess up my drink run out of a key ingredient (like soda water) or just in general make a mistake. However, it's not even the mistakes that kill this place for me. It's the horribly rude bartenders and managers. It's so bad it's almost funny. They give me someone else's credit card back and glare at me like it's my fault ? Ok C.A.S.A. . I've tried. I hope you are successful, but I just can't come here anymore.",

I had 2 then switched to margaritas. 3rd, if I wasn't hungover and sick of drinking beer, I would of got the $9 bucket of beer, then every bucket after that is $5. I couldn't start off that way today.  Now Im not a fan of the music they play, and they play it loud, so everyone in the bar is just yelling at one another, even my wife next to me was yelling at me.

On a 100 degree day the patio was cool and comfortable. Misters and fans do a great job. Ordered the nacho app - hands down the best nachos I've had in years. Great portion. We shouldn't have finished it because it was so much, but we did cuz it was so good! Carne Asada was so flavorful that we had to follow it up with the steak and potatoes burrito. Nom nom nom.

The service was relatively slow but done with a smile.  Our drinks took awhile to arrive and they screwed up two of our orders, one minor and one major that caused that person to get their food very late.  They were apologetic but didn't offer anything in the way of discount or free dessert.  Several of us ordered the mac and cheese burrito because it sounded amazing.  Was tasty, but very filling.  The chips and salsa was tasty and while we ordered just one portion it was enough for the whole table to try some.  Salsa was tangy and had a little heat.  Most of the group enjoyed their food although some at the other of the end of the table were not as pleased but I couldn't speak to why.  Overall not a bad place to eat but not good if you are in a time crunch. Probably won't be back for awhile but I can see really wanting to have that burrito again some day.",

I'm disappointed, but proud that my friend I were raised better than to let something so disgusting go by unhandled.  For the record, I have been to CASA almost every weekend. To see people I recognize working and doing nothing about this situation has really left a bad taste in my mouth. It's a shame because out of all the places on mill CASA really has the best drinks and music, but to see their workers so immature about a situation like this WHICH WAS HAPPENING ON CASA PROPERTY is pathetic. This happened on September 18th 2017, so for whichever CASA employee in charge of monitoring this yelp page...I highly suggest you go back to that day and see who was working because they represented CASA in the most negative light.",

When the security guard had approached me and told me my friend needed to leave because he was too intoxicated, and I told him I believed we were talking about different person because my friends had not began drinking yet that night. He told me \"because of that comment you can leave too\". Honestly, they have a job to distinguish who's drunk and who's not and they can't even do that correctly. I know they were nearing closing time and I believe they were trying to get rid of people to make their job easier. I had witnessed people intoxicated myself in their premises, and they didn't bat an eye... which was not hard to see. But instead they targeted my group of friends who were searching for a good time. That's alright, we won't come again. Shitty music, shitty DJ, shitty service, and most of all: shitty ass security guards. I'll make sure to inform my family to not come here in the future.",

    "text": "I give them an A for effort, but there were several things lacking.  My first beef was their lack of vegan machaca, if the menu has items listed they should be available. The second being was the less than stellar service. Our water was only refilled long after being empty and asking, the bottomless chips and salsa had a bottom after the first cardboard dish.   My Chinese takeout burrito was, inventive but not my favorite item. The spring rolls (in the burrito) were far from fresh being crisp on the surface bush mushy inside of that.   Overall I was not impressed, maybe this is better suited as a outdoor drinking patio, that apparently permits smoking..",

    "text": "Okay, so here's a story. Basically a group of my friends and I, maybe like 6 people total, decided to go to mill for my 21st birthday. We decided to go to casa because they had a good deal on their buckets.   The moment the bouncer lets me in he told me \"next drink is water okay?\" Thinking it was a joke because it was my 21st I giggled and walked away. So we went upstairs and ordered 2 buckets for the table. Our waitress was a gem!   The moment our drinks hit the table the same bouncer showed up immediately almost out of thin air and asks me if we can't talk outside. I was extremely cooperative and went with him. Mind you at this point I've had maybe 2 drinks and was perfectly fine. He escorted me outside the gate to give me a stern talking to (it was not even 9pm) about how it was time for me to turn it. He told me that I didn't listen to him when he told me to get water and that it was for my safety. I kindly explained to him that I felt fine and thought I was acting fine. If he needed me to leave I wouldn't have fought it that is his job after all. But I feel as if he had it out for me from the start.   So he allowed me to go back upstairs at this point I just wanted to go. I was humiliated and ashamed but I had done nothing wrong.   My friend I was with decided to talk to him before we left to explain how he ruined the night. Before my friend could ask why he wanted me to leave so badly, he told her verbatim \"well she was acting like she was mentally retarded the minute she walked in here\" while he held her arm really tightly. We grabbed the head of security after this comment and tried to get some answers and feel a little better. Brent was very kind and heard us and even wished me a happy birthday.   I most likely won't be back there after this incident. I felt embarrassed and profiled for being a young woman. Every single word the bouncer said to me was said in such a rude manner.",

Only one of my friends had a small amount- no one else. We all had our own drinks. Then he tried getting aggressive and said my boyfriend popped the bottle- which he had just arrived. Nearby people even said we did not take items without consent, but we were wrongfully accused and asked to leave. Casa supports chauvinistic men who are just there to pick up women and kick them out when rejected. I haven't been to Mill Ave in over a year and I remember why now. 0 stars if possible!",

It's an outside bar/restaurant, and I'd much rather go here to drink than to sit down and eat. They have an upstairs area as well but that too is also always crowded.  First time I came here I didn't know better to order beforehand so when I got there I had to awkwardly sit at the bar and order food while everyone else was socializing and drinking because apparently no one goes there to sit down and eat. I tried both the vegan burrito and the vegan tacos and that's this place's saving grace honestly because I wouldn't come here for any other reason! Second time I came I called in to pick up my order and even THAT wasn't helpful because no one knew where the heck my food was and they kept sending me on a wild goose chase to different people/places to find it, talk about no communication!   The food itself however, OUTSTANDING! Both the \"carne asada\" burrito and taco vegan options are so delicious, it makes me not miss meat at all! It tastes just like something you would get an authentic Mexican restaurant, I couldn't even tell that it was made from plants! I will continue to come here for their vegan food for sure, but only if I call in AND if they know where my food is when I arrive!",

Now as far as their vegan choices, I'm not sure if things recently changed but the menu only showed the mock carne asada burrito and tacos, nothing else. I asked the bartender and she said that it was all they served that was vegan. So if you are looking for a variety they are not going to have a variety. The bartender was friendly and helpful with all of my questions and the order took about 20 mins for 6 carne asada burritos, 5 tacos and 2 sides of guacamole and chips $100. What took off 2 stars for me are their prices for what you get and the fact that the \"carne asada\" tasted weirdly like a sweet and spicy Mongolian beef (which sounds appetizing, but not when you are looking for something resembling closer to a California carne asada burrito). My kids ate a couple of bites but didn't finish it because of the flavor and spice involved and after I had a night full of tummy aches with them. My husband and I found the burrito to be average in size and taste but not what we expected and not worth the price.",

It has just the right amount of rowdy and laid backness for me. I kind of stumbled upon Casa and I am so very glad I did. Sweet music and the patio bar make this the most perfect hangout joint. There are lots of adult beverage options to choose from, along with 3 different ciders on tap, ALL delicious. Also get the carne asada tacos with lots of cilantro and onions. The tacos are just cheap enough for the broke college student (or traveler on a budget, either way) and so very good. The bartenders were super cool too. There's plenty of seating and it's all outdoors with big TV screens to watch the game. Go in January!! It's like 70-80 degrees every dang day out in AZ! I love it. Can't wait to go back in the not so HOT months and do some more exploring in the PHX/Tempe/Scottsdale area.",

    "text": "CASA was once one of my favorite places in all of the valley. The vibes were great and the best part was their unique burritos. Just recently they've expanded their brand and opened a taco shop done the street.   I came to the original CASA yesterday and EVERYTHING had changed. First, the waitress brought out a plastic tray with plastic forks, knives and napkins. 2.Their signature salsa is gone, and replaced with very watered down salsas with no flavor. 3..And this is worst part, their ENTIRE menu has changed. They have nothing from the original menu. Prices are higher and product is cheaper. For example, my favorite dish was the \"Big Shrimpin\" burrito previously. Now there are these taco plates and just 4 burrito options. Yesterday i got the Cabo Shrimp, which was disgusting. The rice was stale and crunchy. It was definitely old. The shrimp was way too over-seasoned as well. To me, it seems like they just bought way cheaper food in bulk, slashed the menu and now it tastes like a nasty chain restaurant.   4. When the waitress came for our plates, she dumped them in the trash right in front of us! Throughout our meal I was speaking with the waitress about the changes and she was disappointed too!   I'm telling you, I used to go to this place if not every Sunday for brunch but at least every two weeks. No lie, the burritos WERE amazing. And it was cool to order the secret item of the chips and queso. It saddens me to write this review of a place I used to love. PLEASE MANAGEMENT AT CASA BRING BACK THE OLD MENU! The old menu was what got them where they are in the first place! Unfortunately, I won't be going back for food again, maybe some drinks. But I can go to any other place on mill now for a drink, this place was just unique. Thanks for reading.",

    "text": "They have an interesting selection of burritos (i.e: thanksgiving dinner, mac n' cheese). So a group of us went out for a birthday for a happy hour meal. We ordered drinks and then our food, so far so good. Drinks came back, I had ordered a well so I knew the alcohol wouldn't be prime, but it tasted pretty bad. My fault, I should've known better. Moving on, we get our food after a decent wait, it was pleasantly hot. So after it cools we dig in, the burritos lacked flavor, general consensus from everyone at our table. So time finally comes for us to pull the trigger and demand our tabs after waiting for our server/bartender, the guy put it all on one check. Splitting the check was an extremely difficult task for him, commanding a computer to do it must've been too much for him to handle. After he messed up splitting it up a few times I questioned my total and he decided to return my question with a condescending rude response. Moral of the story: buckets of alcohol aren't a good deal, the food is bland, and the staff are the worst part. Won't be going back. I would rather use my bucket to shit in.",

The service is horrible. Both times it took almost 20 minutes to get food and the place was not busy by any means. Server didn't check in at all and we had to ask for the bill and water refills. When asked questions about what was in the food, the server had no clue.  Also - our PLASTIC utensils were dirty! It seriously looked like they re-use plastic utensils. It couldn't even be wiped off with a napkin. Both my friend and I had to dip our napkin in our water glass in order to clean the plastic utensils. Why would plastic utensils be so dirty like this - GROSS!!!  Also, during the day when there is no one on the patio and the big doors are closed, we seriously thought this place was closed. It needs to be a little more inviting on the outside.   Sorry, but I miss Chronic Taco!!",

    "text": "Found this place by accident returning from the Tempe Art Festival. What a hidden gem. We stopped by because the were not overcrowded with Festival goers and it was on our way back to our car. What a surprise!  I ordered the Chinese Takeout Burrito which consisted of crispy Sweet and Sour Chicken, fried rice and spring rolls all inside a flour (or wheat) tortilla. It was huge and wonderful tasting.  I would have loved each item individually but it was extra special in the tortilla.  Nothing was mushy or mashed together. I would order this in a heartbeat.   My hubby got the teriyaki chicken burrito and said it was fantastic.  We are definitely going to make a special trip from Gilbert to have lunch.   Be aware that this is inside a dark bar but understand there is outside seating. Definitely worth a try. The. Young chef is brilliant. Congrats.  Went there with hubby and chef friend today. Again the food was great but the music was excessively loud and we could not hear to talk.",

    "text": "Wow What a Terrible Terrible place! Please do not go here!! My boyfriend and I wanted to grab a few bites to eat so walked down mill and I liked the outiside patio feel so we decided on that.  We ordered our food and we each got a specialty cocktail, I had a mojito which was actually pretty good and my boyfriend had some sort of fruity caiprihana, nonetheless he didnt like it and was so strong it over powered the taste.  Thats really not a big deal to me but what was so horrible is what happened after we asked our waitress if we could order something else for him, a few minutes later she was walking back with what I assumed was the bar manager DJ, well the way he marched down to our table holding the drink it was beyond obvious he was looking for a fight.  He started to argue with us over the drink and asking why we didnt like it, and actually told us that these are \"$10\" cocktails that you cant just send back while throwing the cocktail menu down on the table, umm what happened to customer service??  And he acted like we were some teenagers looking for a free drink, I've lived in plenty of places where the drinks are more than $10 so the fact that he had to mention the price showed me how pathetic this place is.  After about 5 minutes of back and forth arguing, and mind you so loud that I'm sure the other patrons could hear we asked him to take off the drink and left as soon as we could.  I couldnt even finish my food.  Please stay away from this place, I cant even believe this place is still in business after the horrible customer service we've experienced!",

This place had a smallish, chill crowd with a relaxed vibe. I imagine when all the students get back, that could change. I thought the layout was nice, with a prominent bar smack in the center. Ordering drinks was easy and the bartenders were laid back. I'd definately give this place another visit.",

    "text": "Holy crap. So I ran in Pat's Run yesterday as part of a group of about 30. Coming here was planned ahead of time and we had the whole top patio reserved for us. It was fun lots of good people, the weather was perfect, we were all high on endorphins. So we're there, everyone's hungry and eager to relax, have a drink and eat some good food. I was starving, like ready to gnaw my own arm off for a bit of protein. So we discover there is one server for our party and wait patiently for our orders to be taken. Finally it comes to our turn.  I'm not sure if I some how offended our server, or pissed her off, but she did not like me. I don't know why, I was sitting there talking with friends the whole time. I wasn't loud, wasn't complaining about anything, this was in fact the first interaction I had with her. We were all dressed the same so it's not like she could say my outfit offended her,  I just don't know what her deal was. She took the orders of the three people on my right, then the person directly across from me, and then the two people on my left and started to walk off. I said \"excuse me\" twice and was not acknowledged. Someone else at in the group I was sitting with had to physically tap her on the shoulder and tell her to take my order. She did not apologize or even ask what she could get me. She stood there and stared at me. I placed my order and she walked off. A  few of us went down to the bar and ordered drinks, and then drank them and then stood there and waited...and waited...and waited. About 45 minutes after we ordered we noticed that people that ordered after us were getting their food. The food looked really good too. Big sandwiches, big burritos, and big bowls, which is what I ordered. The bowl was served in one of those Chinese take out boxes and consisted of eggs, meat (bacon, ham or chorizo), potatoes, onions and peppers and were full to the brim. So finally our server comes around and takes our drink orders. Another 15 minutes go by AND WE GOT FOOD!!! Well, everyone I was sitting with got food. I did not. I had started to notice that the portions were getting smaller and smaller. So everyone starts to eat and our drinks come out. Again, everyone but mine.  Finally my food comes out after everyone I was with had finished their meals. 75 minutes after I ordered I finally had my food.The Chinese takeout box was less than half full and was getting cold. The bacon was limp and clumped together, the food was bland and tasteless. No salt and pepper, no flavor. Even the bacon was bland. THE BACON was bland! BACON! Ugh.I ate half. Still had no drink. By this point I was grumpy, hungry and defeated. I don't get it. I don't know what the deal was but  it is safe to say that I would never come back here.",

Oh because I LOVE tequila. Just no gold tequila unless it's in a margarita that's okay.   Now if you are already feeling it from prior drinks elsewhere and are looking to eat this is a place to come when you have friends with you to sit upstairs and take it easy and knock some more drinks back.  Because during the time you wait depending on your waitress you might have to wait a bit you might not. Now when my friend and I went on Friday we weren't concerned really on how long it took between things until we wanted to pay for our tab. Apparently the waitress was down stairs serving as well. We easily could have ditched our tab in which my friend was saying we should do but since it was Friday the 13th I felt like we would get bad juju for something like that. So we had to search high and low for this waitress of ours and told another waitress we needed to leave right now and had to get our waitress then she came running. When you are working multiple tables on multiple levels I don't expect prompt service on a Friday night just a good place to come for drinks really because the Mac and cheese burrito is okay at best. Nothing spectacular just better drunk food then filibertos nonsense!",

The chicken has a little zing and the waffles are topped with bacon and ham and a whole lot of yummy.  My friend had the chorizo burrito and her 8 year old son had the breakfast sandwich and they both really liked their food as well.  The menu is not too extensive but very unique and enough of a variety to pick from.  I myself do better with less options because otherwise it takes me way too long to order.  They also had a live DJ playing and the music was great! Not too loud or crazy, just some very chill music that really added that extra touch to the ambience.

    "text": "I've got to dock this place one star. I absolutely HATE when people knock a new restaurant for bad service. It's inevitable that a brand new spot will have some growing pains while training everyone, dealing with turnover, figuring out the menu, the p.o.s., etc. So, I didn't begrudge C.A.S.A. some pretty bad service to start.  The thing is though, it hasn't improved over the last few months. I'd like to preface this by saying there are a few nice, competent, friendly servers there (they're both brunette women - try to sit in their section), but the majority of the servers are just bad. I doubt many of their servers have prior serving experience as many of them only perform one task at a time. Let me explain. We (a group of two) arrived at the same time as the table next to us. The server greeted them, took their drink order, put it in and WAITED AT THE BAR for the drinks to be made before giving them their drinks and making his way over to us. You don't have to be a career server to know that this is a massive waste of time. The restaurant was absolutely empty - dude had two tables - yet he managed to simulate the experience of dining at an overcrowded and understaffed restaurant.  In addition to the bad service, the food has gotten worse. The vegan carne asada was so ridiculously good the first time I ate at C.A.S.A., but it seems to get drier, blander, and smaller every time we come. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we'll be back too often.",

It was nice to sit right on Mill Ave.   Seeing no one else with food should have been a red flag for me. I ordered food nonetheless. I ordered Carne Assad tacos and a Moscow mule. Initially I had no intention to drink but I waited so damn long to receive a menu and have my order I felt like it didn't make sense not to. From when I got there to when I ordered I kid you not it took nearly 45 minutes. I contemplated leaving a few times but I stayed because the reviews are so decent I just had to try.   I had to ask for just meat and cilantro. They normally pre-mix everything in the tacos. I asked for corn tortilla, was served flour. I was too hungry to send it back. The damn carne asada was soooooo oily and salty. Unnecessarily salty actually. Bland rice. Bland beans. It wasn't until after I received my food that I realized that his place is known for its alcohol buckets. Not the food.   Eat here at your own risk. Might be a cool place to come hang out when it isn't too hot and want a place to go have just drinks with friends.",

A man from the bar handed her a styrofoam cup of water and the bouncer violently grabbed it from her hand and dumped the water into the street. The bouncer was an older white man with either very short hair or a shaved head. He had a few days of beard growth.  I saw the drunk girl in the bar and had been watching her. She was drunk but was not causing any problems.  She was clearly over served by the bar. I doubt they let her in that drunk. Each person that is let into the bar has to walk by a bouncer and show their ID. The bar is at fault either way as they either let her in drunk or served her too many drinks. This is a college bar. The bouncers should be responsible adults who know how to handle students. This particular bouncer did not and should not be working there.",

And if they didn't have the white girl take it off then they could get sued for not applying same rules?? They also have a rule against wearing Air Jordan's or Timberlands. It appears as if it is more of a racist establishment than anything. I have spent a lot of my money here and live down the street.

The last thing that really threw me off was that the security just let my friend in but had asked to rummage through my wallet sized purse and gave me a look like I was hiding something in it? Mind you my friend has like the biggest purse filled with stuff so like idk it made me feel not welcomed? If you're gonna check a girls purse make sure to check her friends too so you're not singling anyone out you know? Even she was like \"what the heck? Rude.\" Idk.

    "text": "Let me start by saying I've been Bartending and in the service industry for many years.  Last Sunday my good friend and I went into CASA for our day off since we just worked our butts off all week Bartending.  We go to walk into line, by this point we have probably had about 3 beers since 5 o clock and a shot.  We got to their establishment at about 10 ish.  Immediately we get told we can't go into the club because we were \"intoxicated\" which we were not heavily intoxicated like most young adults were in this establishment.  We were in T- shirts,  jeans, hats and sneakers. Still looked super cute though.  We end up taking him into letting us in.  We of course are about 5 years older than most of their crowd. We were under the assumption that they were judging us simply off of our age.  We proceed to go to the bar to order a couple drinks. Let me just tell you the two times we did order drinks the bartenders were the most rude and mean people I have ever seen Bartending before EVER.  After getting our drinks we made our way into the club area. We danced our butts off because again we were simply just having a good time. Making friends. Bought a couple people birthday shots and so forth.  Of course I am hot and want some water at this point. So I kindly ask the bartender at the bar inside or the club area for a water. This jerk chugged his water bottle in front of me, slammed it onto the counter and says, \"no but I can sell you one for $3.00\".  I was seriously so shocked I didn't know how to even react.  First of all it's against the law in Arizona to decline anyone water.  Second of all I am a bartender and probably Poor over 100 waters a night for customers at the club I work at. Mind you 75% of the time I get tipped $1.00-$5.00 for just one water. So paying for it was not the issue. The fact that he rudely chugged it in my face and demanded I had to pay really just shocked me.  I pulled the manager aside and he honestly didn't have much to say about the situation.  Not only were we singled out in the beginning of our experience. We then were treated poorly the whole time and denied a water, which again is against the law in Arizona.  I could of been having a stroke or something seriously wrong with me. Maybe I was dehydrated from the day and dancing for the past hour.  This is beyond the worst experience I have ever had at any bar ever before in my life.  I have talked to multiple police offers, whom I work with 3 times a week at my night club. I asked them if it is illegal for them to deny me water and they all confirmed In Arizona it is against the law.  Thank gosh there was nothing seriously wrong with me because this establishment would be not just worried about a bad yelp review.  My family and friends will never again go to this establishment. Seriously disappointing  And the plus side. The security guards were the most pleasant people ever. Which is really weird because they all make the less in this type of business.  Matt and Garret were the security I dealt with and honestly they were the only people who deserved to be paid well that night!!!",

One particular customer complained to the security about it and got escorted out. The huffy puffy security went on his little walkie and announced \"this dick weed is done!\" Then proceeded to communicate to other club security to black list him from other clubs.

My girlfriends and I came over for an usual Thursday night visit to casa as we thought it was going to be like any other week we come here but no.

My friends complained about their \"bucket\" drink so I had a sip of it and it was the worst beer I ever had. Came to the \"manager\" bartender inside and she pretty much told me that because we drank half of the bucket (which we didn't. They never even serve the full thing) the couldn't do anything about it. so I kindly told her that beer was not good (sandy and not carbonated enough) Jezz I even blamed on the cups being \"dirty\" just to be nice but she pretty much in short words told me she couldn't help me. Ok. Went to the other manager on the other side. Worst idea ever. He was very unprofessional. Made me wait there without knowing what was going on for a bit I even had to ask a server if he was gone trying to help me or? The severs were all nice btw and the girl didn't know. He finally comes backs Treated me like I was a stupid little girl and told me his bartenders wouldn't mess up a drink EVER. Come on! Like serving a drink on a busy night wouldn't make you make a mistake?. He honestly made me feel so little as costumer for just wanting to get things straightened up with my drink. I still even told him look I don't care about money I just want to have a good drink (my drink looked like a soup). All I wanted was for them to say sorry and maybe give me the SAME beer from a better tap but no. These people have the worst costumer service and made my night horrible. Never coming here again as so is my friends.",

When I was there I tipped very generously, though afterward one of my friends had accidentally drank too much and was not having a good time there shortly after close. I very politely and casually approached the bar and asked if I was able to get a cup of water for him. The entire staff yelled at and cursed at me. Having roughly 10 employees scream and curse at your rather than politely replying with a no is absolutely the most unprofessional thing I have ever experienced. Go to any of the other bars on Mill, as this one does not deserve to be in business with the absolutely toxic customer service.",

The bucket drinks are a great deal and refills are only $5-6 if you feel inclined. Overall it's a good atmosphere although the music selection can be odd and outdated. I'd recommend finding a seat upstairs where it's also easier to get bar service.",

I literally used to take everyone who visited me to CASA to eat this burrito with their salsa because I considered it to be an iconic food of Tempe.   Today I finally went back to CASA after a long time because I was dyyying to eat this burrito again. I got there and was super disappointed to see that the entire menu has changed. I got the new carne asada / Mac & cheese burrito. Which was just astonishingly gross and chemically tasting. I took about 3 bites and boxed it up hoping my bf's stoner roommate will some day be high enough to consume what would otherwise be a sad waste of ingredients.   Sad to say it but, RIP CASA.  Only the buckets can save you now.",

Mac n Cheese burrito and Carne Asada tacos were great, def brought some home. Not sure about some other reviews about this place, but I had a great time! Please keep it up guys. Very relaxed with great vibes btw.  Another great experience, I brought my friends dad, a POW fighter pilot and his service dog. We all had a great experience, many thanks to our server Halie(sp?) super awesome. Just one of many visits to come! Thank you guys. It meant the world to get my friends dad out of the house and him have a great time! Can't at thank u enough",

I came out with one of my cousins from another country who had a clear form of identification that stated her date of birth as well as every amount of information needed to get into the bar. Her form of identification clearly stated she was 32... Not 21 or 20, but 32. If she was close to the age of 21 I would clearly understand the situation at hand but I am a loyal customer for many years and have tried to hold back, but I have had enough. The bouncer treated us like garbage and not once even attempted to reconcile the situation. At the worst I would've understood him if he spoke in a kind manner, but he immediately took to anger and frustration as if I was trying to harm him in some way. This place needs to reconsider their employment or else this matter will continue to happen.",

It was an overall bad experience, the only thing that I can compliment the establishment on is the great heaters they have. Those bad boys kept the whole patio toasty. Service was so/so, nothing to complain about. Over priced drinks, small food portions (small price tag however), and bad customer service from the other staff besides our waitress. The bar staff and the security must not have realized we spent a good 300 dollars there as a group that night because they treated us like they wanted us gone. The place has great intentions, just not quite there yet.",

These two girls who are friends of my son, who were also of black decent, said that they had no idea who he was but they were going to make sure that he was safe and ok. After making sure that he was indeed safe, the two friends tried to renter the bar. Security had said that they were not allowed in because they were friends with the male patron that was removed. After a long discussion, they didn't let the girls back into the bar. What came next truly shocked me. As they were waiting for a ride home, a security guard turns to his coworker and said \" it smells like monkeys out here\". That is WRONG!!! I will never be back to this place.",

They do free refills on soda. And the fireball is $3.50 and you can get it as a fireball coke for the same as the fireball shot. So I'm happy cuz I like the fireball coke. I got hungry, so I decided to try one of their burritos.... They are a bit expensive... $9-$10 or so, but they are fairly big... I only ate half of mine and I was full. I got the Chinese take out which had crunchy sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, and egg roll bites in it. It is an interesting idea and may not sound very appetizing, but it is good. The only complaint I have is that it is a bit on the spicy side... I wasn't expecting spicy in sweet and sour chicken.... other than that it was great! Nice staff... however there is a $10 minimum if you're using card.",

I went in last night for dinner and was blown away with the awful service. We were not greeted. Sat ourselves upstairs (as the \"bartender\" sat behind the bar and texted) we sat without menus or being greeted for 5 min. I then had to ask for a menu, was given one menu (for two of us and no drink list). After we looked over the menu still no server in sight... We waited another five min before I had to get up walk down stairs and ask for two waters myself. Again we waited... FINALLY our server (who was nice but seemed to be totally lost) showed up. We asked for a drink list which took another five min. Still no drink list... Asked again and finally she brought it up to our table.   We ordered our food, still no drinks.. About five minuets later we finally received our beers. The food arrived shortly after which surprised me since everything else took forever.. The only problem was we were not given any utensils,  no napkins, no side plates. Had to ask the server to bring all theses things. After a few minuets she returned and I took my first bite of our carne asada tacos... They were cold, not just a little chilly, it seemed like they were sitting in a fridge prior, the meat was bland and cold and the tortillas were stale and also cold. We also ordered a grilled chicken burrito. It was terrible, once again it was cold. At this point I was just so confused and told myself they couldn't possibly mess up the tortilla chips until I tried one. The chips were drenched with salt, I'm not talking a little too much salt I'm talking about chips COVERED in salt. They were awful and inedible.   I'm so disappointed everything we ordered was just pathetic. I asked our server for our tab as soon as she was in sight and asked nicely to speak with a manager. A manager came up and I informed his of how awful the food was and also told him that the staff should be a little more aware of their surroundings. I work in this business and I know how it important it is for everyone to work together.. This includes the front and back of house including managers. I felt like the servers and bartenders were not trained correctly and the manager I spoke with totally agreed. I don't remember his name but I know he is the bar manager.   ***Note to the owners of this place. LISTEN to your bar manager he seems to know where the problems are and he seems to really care about making changes to better this place. Your staff really needs to get on the same page and work as a team. I won't be back, and if things don't change soon I recommend their bar manager leave for a place that will last. Without a strong team there's nothing.   Very disappointed I was excited to try this place.",

We had a group of 8 or 9 and found a spot that accommodated all of us.  They are also dog friendly :)  I love the patio. They were only serving their limited breakfast menu when we got there but it was great. I don't know who decided to put sweet potatoes in a breakfast burrito but their burritos and breakfast burrito bowls are pretty damn good for a small little patio bar on mill that has only been open for 2 weeks.  I'm looking forward to trying their lunch menu and of course drinks :)  I love that they are open early and I absolutely love patios in AZ this time of year.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because they brought me a burrito instead of the bowl that I ordered. The contents are the same and it still tasted really good.",

    "text": "While back in Tempe for work a couple weeks ago, one of my employees and I were looking for a place to eat dinner before I had to catch a flight to Milwaukee.  I told her that we had to walk over to where Chronic Taco used to be for a moment of silence (check out my review on Chronic Taco.)  There appeared to be a business there, but we weren't sure it was open until a young man outside told us that since we were standing there, we HAD to come in.  Wow, am I ever glad that we followed his advice!  The place looks completely different from Chronic Taco (same owners, though, I'm told) and is a totally different vibe.  Since it was a Monday night during the sweltering heat that is Arizona in July, the place wasn't busy.  The very friendly (and hot) bartender told us we could sit wherever and brought us menus.  That's when I saw it....  MAC AND CHEESE BURRITO!  AHHHHHHHHHH!  Being from Wisconsin, seeing that made me very happy.  The fact that they had a vegan version made my employee happy, since she is vegan.  We both ordered ours with carne asada (mine real, hers fake) and it was by far the most delicious thing I've had in a long time.  The salsa in a bottle was heaven- great flavor, without too much cilantro, which is good, because I'm one of those rare people that cannot stand the taste of cilantro.  The only reason that I'm going with 4 stars here, instead of 5 is that had that guy not been outside to tell me that C.A.S.A. was there and open, we probably would have gone someplace else (and missed out on the heavenly mac and cheese burrito.)  There is nothing outside to lure you in.... but don't worry, I will be telling everyone how much I love it and can't wait to go back to Arizona.... which will NEVER be in July again.",

I was a little disappointed when they restructured it to be C.A.S.A., but quickly fell in love with their unique sandwiches. Our work time crew frequently suggested this restaurant for lunch. We indulged in sandwiches such as The Fidel, and their amazing OG Burger ... until today. This is their first day of a new menu consisting mostly of burritos. Our lunch party was shocked. Our favorite selections were now gone, and in its place were several burrito choices. My choice was the #11 Chinese Buffet. A burrito with fried rice, spring rolls, and orange fried chicken. Sounds glorious right? The rice did not taste good, and there was too much of it. The orange chicken was good, but I was set off by the spring roles that remind me of the sort you find at the grocery store. The rest of my party of 6 were not impressed by their selections either. The only approval was a co-worker who selected the BBQ chicken with coleslaw and macaroni and cheese. This, is possibly the only edible thing on the menu.   Had they taken contents of the old menu, and put them in burrito form, it may have been acceptable. The Fidel in a burrito? OG Burger with fried egg in a burrito? Glorious.  Enough about the food. There were some other issues. This is the first day of their menu, so some of this MAY be somewhat excusable. Our food took a long time, with one of our party waiting over 15 minutes for his meal while the rest of the group was eating. You would think that on their first day of a new menu, they would ask their regulars for input.  C.A.S.A. is now removed from our selection of lunch-time restaurants.",

The bar itself is perfectly situated in the heart of tempe and is composed entirely of patio seats.  You would think that you really couldn't go wrong with a setup like this in sunny Tempe, AZ.   Service:  Unfortunately, the owners/managers have decided on a staff of security and bar tenders who would rather talk to each other then make sure that their guests are enjoying themselves.  Their waitress although pleasant and apologetic cannot seem to get you a drink in under 15 minutes and will likely forget an item or two off your order.  I don't know if they are woefully understaffed or they are just slowed down due to their chatty staff and the fact that their kitchen is actually located at a neighboring bar two doors down!  Drinks:  It truly is a shame their staff is terrible because their drinks can be quite good.  I love their mojito I just don't when or if I will actually get one do to their ineffective staff  Food:  Their food is a big miss.  Basically they have decided to take random cuisines and repurpose them as burritos.  Fettuccine Alfredo burrito?  Thanksgiving dinner burrito?  Chicken in broccoli maybe? I really don't know what they are thinking.  This location has so much promise I hope the management can turn it around but after visiting this place 4 or 5 times it doesn't look like it's going to happen.",

Maybe if a collage bar scene is what I was looking for, my review could be better.   That being said, we had the vegan tacos. They were ok, but not excellent. Once again, I love any place willing to give the option, and I certainly liked them more than eating meat! They were just sort of plain.   Another cool option I love in any place is the ability to do lettuce tacos instead of tortillas! The call it \"Kush\" style here.   The service was great, the outdoor seating is lovely, but don't be fooled, this is not a vegan restaurant. It's a bar, that serves tacos, with one vegan option. Kudos Casa!",

They have bomb vegan tacos aside from their other food that is just always on point and delicious. The drinks and the dancing sometimes I come out for that but it's always just the food. I went back-to-back nights and the second time when we walked up to the bar to place a simple food order on a not even busy Saturday night but the bartender was too busy to pay attention to paying customers. He was only focused on the cocktail waitresses that work there instead of the customer in front of him waiting to be serviced. To bringing in business is what I thought any business would want. After finally catching his full attention he took our order with zero customer service with the body language that clearly suggest ur bugging me with this order. I love the food and will continue to keep going back but the service needs to turn around and if you don't want to work at an establishment where that's it's main DUTY!!! THEN DONT. the customer service industry act so entitled, to be rude to the capital that walks through a business door, matters. but people need to remember and wake up if you chose to work at that job that is service base then do exactly that! if you don't like it find another job.

I've never been able to leave a decent tip at these places because the service has always been just bad. I will continue to come back for the food tho.",

Super hot waitresses with half their butt/boob showing (ladies, if your man has wandering eyes, maybe you won't love that ASSpect).  There were handsome, stern faced security guards EVERYWHERE. It made me feel safe, although a little weird that they were just stiffly watching us lol.  Long lines waiting to get in at midnight - so you know this place is popular.   Negatives - with ppl getting pretty wasted, there were quite a few spilt drinks on the floor. Long bathroom lines, (where they are also spilt drinks) and a crowded bar.",

I wore a collared shirt, nice jeans, and black Jordan's. The security guard scanned my shoe, held out his hand and said 'no'.   I was told that management does not allow anyone wearing high-tops, and sneakers into the establishment. It's immediately clear to me who this policy dis-proportionally affects. This policy may as well say 'blacks not welcome'. I was confused, and even told the security guard that this 'policy' sounded Jim Crow levels of racist. His face seemed to agree, but CASA Sunba pays his bills so we were sent away.   A dress-code guide printed outside the establishment would be nice, at least that way our party could've been spared the embarrassment of being the black people who weren't allowed to enter.   One thing I noted, was just like all the clubs on Mill that night, the CASA was blasting the latest Drake, rap and hip-hop hits. Didn't, Drake just release a new pair of Jordan? Aren't the types of shoes you're discriminating against strongly linked to the culture of music that makes your establishment worthy of its clientele?   The lesson I learned from your bar, is that Casa Sunba will utilize black culture for marketing and promotion, but is happy to deny our people entry at the door. A cursory glance of other Yelp reviews about Casa Sunba confirm this. I'm happy to take my money elsewhere. And I encourage, and will encourage, anyone and everyone else to do so as well.",

I came by on a Monday night so I can understand why it wasn't packed. It lived up to its hype but it wasn't anything super spectacular.   The bucket is any cocktail in a small bucket. It took time to finish it and I was sharing! If I downed it I'm sure that I'd be drunk in an instant. My only thing is that there are no prices for the bucket on the menu. I heard that it was $8 but when we paid it was $16? Dunno if it fluctuates depending on the day but knowing that ahead of time would be nice.",

    "text": "I typically avoid more crowded bars but decided to visit Casa last night with a friend. Casa's patio has nice misters to keep patrons cool on summer nights and an upstairs deck in addition to their main room, which was closed, but the patio seating was nice. After being overlooked by the bartender Garrett several times, my friend and I managed to order a bucket each. I did a margarita and she an AMF.   While chatting at a table, a young woman passed out TWICE. The security guards helped her up and showed concern but no ambulance was called.. she collapsed onto the concrete! I doubt a report was made for this incident but that lady most likely has a concussion after falling like that and hitting her head on concrete. Extremely concerning that they allowed her to just take an Uber home, granted that I was simply observing so don't know all of the details. Anyway, we stayed and continued chatting, feeling somewhat distraught about that situation.   Coming near closing time around 1:30am, we opted to order green tea shots and another bucket each since we felt hardly buzzed after the first. The shots tasted somewhat off and might be what caused us both to get extremely sick? We both are 22 and drink quite frequently so are not sensitive to alcohol. We both hardly remember our Uber drive home & both blacked out last night after TWO drinks and a shot. I had drank plenty of water and ate a healthy meal for dinner and my friend expressed the same. I have consumed way more alcohol than I did last night without getting sick. Despite the fact, I threw up a ridiculous amount and feel horrible today, as does my friend.   I am also great about being drunk and making it to a toilet but threw up on my clothing and floor last night?? My friend and I both feel strange about last night and are suspicious about the drinks we were served. Garrett provided less than great service and caused us both to get veryyyy fucked up and sick. This place is sketchy.",

It was like beef jerky wrapped in a dry corn husk.  The mojito was incredibly weak and had not a hint of rum.  The pastor sandwich was ok but forgettable.   The management was worst of all.  We were told by our server upon arrival that it was happy hour and beers were half off.  When we received our bill, beers were full price.  When the server was confronted he apologized and spoke with the manager; he returned to us saying there was nothing he could do and he fought for us.  The manager never stopped by the table or said a word to our table about the miscommunication.  Whoever the manager was today should be fired and ashamed for being a coward; you're an embarrassment.

    "text": "I had a great time at Casa this afternoon while the manager of Casa told me to \"eat shit and fuck off\".  We were enjoying our afternoon at Casa when the neighboring table decided it would be a prime time to light up a cigarette. I don't take kindly to inconsiderate smokers thinking they can smoke wherever they want so I told the guy to put his cigarette out. He decided that his right to poison himself was more important that anything else and jumped up and immediately got in my face.  This guy started yelling at me while I stood my ground and said to the guy that if he touched me I would love to defend myself by any means necessary and get the nearby cops involved. He got really aggravated and kept yelling at me a few inches away from my face. Eventually he realized he wasn't going to win the fight and calmed himself down. A minute later the manager came over and started yelling at our group.  I told the manager what happened: how the guy at the table next to use tried to assault me on their property. The manager didn't care to hear my side of the story and instead kicked me and my friends out of Casa because I told the guy to stop smoking.  Fortunately I can use the internet to find out what the law in Arizona is with smoking on a patio. I'll quote from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fazdhs.gov&s=d21a0949e648ec4ed11667f54c9dec5159329017bae0d7dc363d7133673ae9fb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">azdhs.gov</a>:  \"For an area to be designated as an outdoor patio where smoking is permitted, the area must meet the requirements defined in the rules A.A.C. R9-2-108. This area must be a contiguous area of the public place or place of employment and controlled by the proprietor of the public place or place of employment. This patio area must have at least one side that consists of: ...  - Have no overhead covering or an overhead covering that consists of:      a. Permeable material, or     b. A combination of open space permeable material\"  The crazy thing is Casa has an overhead covering that is a combination of open space permeable material. Great thing they are aware of Arizona laws!  I came back and asked if the owner was available to let them know about their violation of Arizona laws. Instead I was greeted by the same bouncer/\"manager\" that kicked us out earlier. I tried to tell him that Casa was breaking the law and he laughed in my face and literally told me to fuck off. Very professional. I have reported Casa to the Arizona Department of Health Services and I hope they do an investigation.   I will never return to Casa after the ridiculous treatment I received from the so called \"management\". I felt like I was talking to a toddler in the middle of a tantrum rather than a manager of a bar on Mill Ave.",

You are a professional establishment...how do you mess up something as easy as a margarita? That shit was undrinkable. It somewhat resembled a combination of milk and orange juice. When I asked the bartender to taste it, he refused and just poured another shot into it and told me to quit complaining. Pouring more tequila in it is not going to make it taste better. I'm not one to complain but it really was that bad. Both myself and my friends that I was with ended up leaving pretty much our entire drinks.

It does look inviting and I had a totally different experience when I 1st went there, but my 2nd time....I will never go back.  We came with a group for a birthday lunch and a few of us already experienced the food and ambience, so we were excited to have a birthday lunch and let everyone in on the positive experience.  Holy Moly....with the exception of our waitress the service right down to chef Joey and the management staff was HORRIBLE.  The food presentation on ONE order was not up to par and that ONE order made this whole experience unexpectedly bad.  The veggie rice bowl was ridiculous in every aspect.  When it came out it looked like crap.  When the person questioned the order....OMG, chef Joey stormed out....and copped an attitude.   How dare we.... It was so ridiculous it was almost entertaining.  He could barely contain himself when we questioned the veggie rice bowl.  I think he watched way too many Chef Gordon Ramsey shows.  Look at Sunny B's write up...then look at her pictures.  You will see what I mean.  Joey was so unprofessional, ready to fight and so unwilling to rectify the situation.  To make matters worst management came over to inquire about the situation and did nothing.  Not only did they not give any options or did not take the veggie rice bowl off the tab, it was a bad experience that 8 of us encounter and the 8 of will never come back.  Oh. Believe me we are telling our friends and co-workers avoid this place....because you don't want  to deal with Joey storming out of the kitchen!",

Maybe they didn't expect so much traffic. Maybe they were still training the staff.   Well I've been back five times since then. I have had horrible service every single time. The food is still good, but not half as good as it was the first time. The first time I went the vegan carne asada was juicy and heavily marinated. But the last couple times it's barely been marinated at all. Between the excessive amount of incompetent servers on the floor and the annoying amount of off-duty employees sucking down cocktails at the bar, there's typically around 15 servers downstairs at a time. And yet it still takes 10 minutes to order my first drink.   Many of the servers do that annoying thing where they can only handle doing one thing at a time, even if it's grabbing water for a table with full drinks while another table has been waiting ten minutes for a cocktail that's melting at the edge of the bar. For god sake, please learn to multi task and prioritize.   What's Still Good: * Patio * Cocktails * Prices * Vegan options * Food  * Friendliness  What Sucks: * Service * Food is not as good as it used to be  * Bro vibe * Epic amounts of looming employees",

Today we went and sat on the roof. We ordered at 12:15 and by 1:00 we were still waiting for our Mac and Cheese Burrito.  The server told us they had a big party while the owner then came over and told us the health inspector shut the kitchen down for a half hour.  Either way I will not be back.  Only good if you have at least 2 hours to kill for lunch",

Girls Softball playing on every screen when the NBA playoffs are on?  wtf? 2.  Mojitos took forever!  3.  Street Tacos took even longer!  damn.  But then we found out our server forgot to ring them in. nice.  4. Service was so random and they couldn't decide who was taking our table.  When we left, we still didn't know who our server was.  5.  This is listed as a \"tapas\" restaurant on Yelp but most definitely is not.  It just has a random assortment of California-type Mexican food items.   6.  They have so many staff memebers/security guards on that its overwhelming.  I understand the owner is trying to prepare for the unexpected but damn, just get competent ppl and not an army of...well....you know.    Good things:  1.  The mojitos that took forever were great! 2.  The HH prices are good enough to get me back.  3.  The location is awesome.    I really hope they get it together.",

The special that reels us in time and time again is the $2 Coronas before sunset. We always make it right before sunset so we try to get as many beers as we can before they cut us off. It's nice sitting on the balcony sippin on some beers watching the sunset over Mill Ave. You gotta get them at the bar downstairs but we've ordered on the balcony and the bartender brings it up. (we just tipped a little better). We have tried their tacos, they are alright...pretty small but they're pretty cheap so you get what you pay for. Great spot for day drinking and I'd say a great deal if you are looking for a happy hour or a place with drink specials,",

Drinks? Large, cheap, and in buckets they might let you take home- it depends on the night. I'm very comfortable going to this place and not spending a dime, so I recommend it for a free night out dancing.   Dress code? Depends on your gender and how the bouncer is feeling. To be honest, young women get away with basically anything while guys can get turned away for wearing joggers. I've been let it with workout clothes and a backpack when my guy friends have been told they need pants with belt loops and they have to leave a smaller backpack outside (on the same night). This place is super sexist but if you're a cute girl don't worry about it.   Dancing? Yes. Music isn't special but it's not bad either. The floor is small but you also get to dance on a small outcropping around the tables. Kind of dangerous, so don't mix that with too many drinks.   Space in general : this place features a strong contender for the world's longest women's bathroom line, manned by a bouncer even on Thursday nights. You won't get a table unless it's a weeknight, you're early, or it's past 1am.",

I've been told this is a place that you go to to get drinks that come in large buckets so you can get super trashed as quickly as possible. That sounds like my kinda thing so I wanted to try this place out.  One thing that really irked me was that for the buckets themselves, they didn't have the prices on the menu so you don't know how much they cost. I ended up ordering a Jack and Coke bucket that cost me $16. A friend who goes to ASU told me that they usually cost like $8-10 so I didn't know where I went wrong and had nothing else to compare it to. The bucket itself took a while to finish for two people but I still don't think it's worth $16. I can get a whole fifth of whiskey and liter of coke for $16 so that's gonna be a nope from me.",

Tonight was different. The bouncer looked me up and down, laughed, and said \"you look like you're wearing pajamas\" and that I wasn't allowed in because my shirt was too \"baggy.\" So, because I wasn't wearing a tight shirt that showed off my cleavage on a Saturday night, I wasn't allowed in the bar with all of my friends.

The new indoor part gives you the feel of going to old town without the outrageous prices! There have been a few times I have been harassed by some men in there and security was quick to help making me feel safe inside the establishment. The food is so underrated!!! The tacos are amazing, I suggest walking to OG Taco (owned by CASA) next door before if you want faster food service!",

My friend and I got there around 8 while the bartender was training a newbie.. which was frustrating but understanding. It was rough but we both got it because we work in the industry. Then the night time bartender showed up... a brunette with an attitude that reached the stars. She was rude, talking shit about the new bartender, and then on top of it was so completely inadequate and blase to guests. I told her repeatedly do not run my card.. which she then did. No eye contact. No remorse. No nothing. I expressed my annoyance and again, no emotion. She was ANNOYED AT ME. Then she gave me the peace sign as I left. Takes a lot to insult me but her entitlement was terrible.",

    "text": "Insulted, verbally abused, disrespected, and one of the worst customer service experiences we have ever had in the state of Arizona. Not only did the manager yell at one of our family members, but was trying to make something be blown way out of proportion.  One of our family members ordered carne asada fries with no spicy flakes. They came back with chicken fries with a ton of spicy flakes. Waitress said we don't have carne asada \"sorry\" and that was fine so we said can you take it back since we didn't order chicken nor spicy flakes.  Then another waitress said \"oh we do have carne asada\" so we reordered and emphasized that we didn't want spicy flakes or spicy seasoning on the carne asada. She received this order and understood \"no spicy.\" Sure enough our order came out and there was extra spicy flakes on it. We were puzzled and didn't want to disturb our server again so our family member just ate a few fries. When we told the waitress that we didn't think it should be on the tab. The male manager got involved.   He was disrespectful, talking down to us about fries that we multiple times ordered to be non spicy. Sure this is one small order mistake but got escalated real quick. The manager gunned down us with verbal abuse and making us feel like we were stupid.   Never never never never never returning to this place ever again. As a yelp elite I've come across some bad service but this one takes the cake! Adios and never again!",

But gf tells him, we just spent $27, in which he replies, we don't have a burrito for $27, so a little irritated at this point, I jump in and say no, that's TWO burritos and a beer for $27. At this point I think he was pist b/c I called him out for that stupid comment, so he throws a $10 bill at me, and tries to get me kicked out. I was super pist, but b/c my gf was there, I didn't say anything else. How does that guy manage any joint, he obviously can't even manage his attitude!",

Our server was excellent, discussing the draft and mixed drink selections with us, and taking care of our party as members trickled in. I enjoyed a couple beers and our friends had the street tacos, which they said were very good. The patio was the perfect place to people watch on a gorgeous game day.

    "text": "While street parking is available we ended up parking in one of the area underground garages.  At just $3 it's less of a headache that driving around trying to find a spot.  We walked up to find that C.A.S.A. was essentially an outdoor bar we were a bit thrown off.  No biggie but it's something worth noting.  Dining outside in Arizona can be pretty toasty.  Thankfully they have the usual misters that take the temperature down a notch.  It's also worth noting that after doing some research we found that there is an indoor 'club' area where food is also served.  We had no clue since the entrance was tucked away behind a wall. Not to mention, we went by the sign that said, \"Order food at the bar.\"  Once again, no biggie.  Unlike their online menu their menus at their location not only provide photos but are clearly marked which burritos can be made vegan.  In addition, when talking to the bartender they gave us the heads up about vegan options as well.  There was a wide variety of fare....all made into burritos.  I chose the Mac and Cheese while my husband went for the Chinese Takeout.  I will say it wasn't the best vegan mac and cheese I've ever had, but it still hit the spot and had a little bite to it.  As for my husband's burrito.  It contained fried rice, chicken, and spring rolls....yes, all inside of the burrito.  There were absolutely no complaints from him.  While I wasn't blown away by our experience we found ourselves in Tempe the following week and decided to stop again.  This time around I tried the veganized Chinese Takeout burrito.  Winner!  That vegan Chinese Takeout burrito kicked butt.  The tofu was perfectly prepared.  Not too squishy, not too tough.  And the taste was delicious. Definitely a repeater. My husband enjoyed the street tacos he ordered but he was quick to admit that he wished he had gotten the Chinese Takeout again.  When you arrive at C.A.S.A. chances are you're not going to get warm and fuzzies like you would if you entered your local bar.  That's not to say the staff isn't polite, it's just a different vibe.  Add in the heat of eating outside and attempting to shout your order to the bartender over the loud music, and  I'm sure some may not be that thrilled with the experience.  For us it's no big deal.  For the chance to get our hands on some food that comes with a different spin and has vegan options we found it worth stepping outside of our normal comfort zone.  We will definitely be returning to try the remaining concoctions that are offered.",

    "text": "Hi Everybody,  I really thought I was done with these but the story I have is waaaay to good not to be told. A couple of close friends and I went to see the Ryan Davis Standup at the Tempe Improv. I do need to state that one of my close friends that was with me) is a very good/famous professional heavyweight fighter named Cain Velasquez (this is very relevant to the story). At the end of the Stand up we all decided to go the Piano bar on Mill Ave to hang out and have a good time.  Overall the night was going great but we decided to head back to our car that was parked in the garage next to Casa Sumba. Cain's wife was one of the members in our group. At this time his wife is over 5 months pregnant.  She needed to stop for quick bathroom break, so we decided to stop there.  The plan was to go in and have drink while Cain's wife handles her business. The bouncer at the front was a bald guy with red facial hair.  As we walked up the bouncer the bounces goes right for me and checks out my clothes which I thought was very silly cause I was wearing normal size everything. He did see that I was wearing Jordan sneakers. With a smirk on his face, he let me know that \"Jordans weren't allowed in the restaurant\". I honestly thought he was joking.    Now Mill Avenue as whole has a reputation for trying to block certain demographics from entering their establishments. I have had issues when I college (nearly a decade ago) getting into places at night when I was wearing very similar clothes as other people that were allowed in. All of these places that I have issued with back then are now out of business. THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER REVIEWS THAT STATE RACE as the reason for a poor experience at CASA Sunba.  Once I could see that the bouncer was really going to deny my access, I became dumbfounded. He was literally the first bouncer I have ever seen that has turned away Cain. 99.9% bouncers know who Cain is and love it when he comes around. I could tell this bouncer was/is special. Like I said I have been denied access to places before, so I usually just laugh it off and go about my business. The problems came from my friends being more pissed than I was. The group I was traveling with was pretty diverse but I was the only black guy. I don't think they were used to getting turned away over petty BS. Well they learned that day. I am always glad to share my experiences with people of other races.    I was trying to tell my friends that are was okay and that these things always turn out for the better. Cain's wife was very unhappy but still needed to use the restroom. The bouncer had zero reason to not let her in and might I add again she was 5 months pregnant. The bouncer actually had the nerve to stop her and give her hard time about going in. He actually blocked her and held her up. Now I was nervous. I don't care if you are bouncer that does tabeo 7 days a week. You are NOT tough enough to stop Cain if he goes off. There probably weren't enough bouncers on that entire block. The bouncer was very lucky that he let her through when he did and he was the only smart thing he did was not touch her cause I knew that would be an instant problem that he couldn't handle.   The bottom line is I understand policies and people doing their job. I also identify a bouncer with ego issues and whatever else that dude had. I'm glad the situation didn't get any worse and overall my night was a blast. However neither my friends or I will ever go back to CASA Sunba. I will try to post a pick of me that night so you can see what I was wearing. It really doesn't matter because the Jordans were apparently the issue. It is 2017. How are wearing Jordan shoes an issue? If this is the restaurants policy then it obviously needs to be changed. If the bouncer took it upon himself to impose his on policies then that restaurants needs to think about restaffing. I'm sure this post will deter some people of color from going in. I'm black and Cain is Mexican and I A LOT of Latinos LOVE Cain.   If you know me then you know my background and that I'm telling 100% truth about everything. I made my profile photo the same photo of our group that night. I could easily think of ways to blow this whole thing up but I don't think the actions of few should affect the people who had no part in these events.  Thanks for reading!",

We had split transactions and we were gonna pool cash tip at the end. But the bar tender say one transaction without tip and refused to to serve us anymore drinks. Even though we tipped after finally receiving our last drink from a different bar tender. And then refused to serve anyone that was seen with is that night. She was completely rude. I get that place was crazy and I'm sure they deal with a lot of drunk rude people but we were not them.",

    "text": "The lack of customer service from this place astounds me. I came here with 3 other people to get some tacos and drinks on a Tuesday night around 8:30. The place was full but didn't seem very busy every one had empty plates on their tables at this point. We sat ourselves on a booth outside near the bar. There were about 3 or 4 servers on the floor who were taking tables. We waited about 10 minutes for menus or to be greeted and neither happened. Since the group was very patient we just kept waiting for one of the 4 servers to notice us. Not a single server greeted us even though they walked by us multiple times. I ended up going to get out own menus, when I asked one of the servers for some menus she rudely threw them at me and walked away. I brought them back to the table assuming a server would see the menus and start to offer us water or get our drinks going. We ended up waiting close to 35 minutes before I got fed up and stopped a server dead in her tracks and asked to speak to a manager. It took the manager another 20 minutes to come to our table. You would think at this point someone would have offered us water or shown any interest in serving us. The manager finally arrived apologized and sent a server over. The server ended up being the server who rudely threw menus at me. I made sure both the manager and the server knew how long we were waiting, how rude she was to us, and how long we have been waiting. He offered to discount our meals and a free round of drinks. We ordered food and literally had it dropped on our table. The topping of the tacos ended being in our laps instead of the plate. No one came to check on us throughout our meal, refilled our drinks, or cleared our plates. The rude server dropped our check off and ran away. We noticed that we were charged full price for everything. I was tired of waiting at this point. So I went directly to the manager gave him the check and had him take care of it right then and there. It was one of the worst experience I have ever had. Will not be coming back here for a while.",

It was a Sunday night so the place was dead. We sat down and ordered our drinks. We were sitting right by the bouncer. Two African American men walk up, show their Id's and were turned away because of the SHOES one guy had on. These men were dressed nicely and were being polite JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE!!! The bouncer became cocky and laughed as he turned away the two men at the gate. I have never in my life experienced such blatant racism. If this is how CASA treats human beings, they deserve to be shut down. It's sad that in 2017 this is happening. My friends and I walked right out after the two men were turned away. I will never spend a single penny at this bar.",

We ordered chips & guac to share for starters. The guac was made fresh & had a lot of flavor. For entrees my friends & I shared the Mac N Cheese burrito & chinese takeout & YES, it is as tasty as it sounds. The burritos are large & decently priced.  Service was decent & fairly fast. Great chill atmosphere if you are just looking to relax with some buddies... & also great live band!  If anything I will be back for the bomb burritos!!",

    "text": "Came to casa 2 weeks in a row on a Wednesday night with friends. Wore a pair of black cat Jordan 13's and was let in last week no mention of a dress code. This Monday came back only to order a vegan item from their menu wearing a pair of Jordan 6's and was turned away because \"jordans are against dress code\". I pointed out to the bouncer that I had been in last week wearing Jordan retros and his excuse was too specific to be believable, but trust will not be trying to get in ever again. Be careful shaggy haired bouncers wearing teeshirts with holes and 99cent flip flops will turn you away because apparently the money you have only spends well at footlocker and house of hoops. Will gladly take my $, j's and challenger to buy food and liquor from a place that doesnt use salty discretion to allow customers in on a week by week basis. This place is a joke, not a bar or restaurant if you have any doubts the atmosphere and food are definitely not worth the risk of possibly being able to spend your money here.  *Updated* Didnt even think it was due to racism but after reading further reviews it all makes sense. The last visits I made to this place were with a large group of white friends. I am actually (believe it or not) half black and half white but extremely fair skinned and wear my hair straightened almost all the time. This week when I returned the only difference was my company. Rather than being with a crowd of white friends I attempted to get in with my clearly black, but mixed half white half black boyfriend. If you're anything other than black go ahead and try this place wearing whatever you would like. What your wearing has absolutely no affect on getting in this place unless it is your skin.",

    "text": "This place is fun. The staff are friendly and welcoming - seems like a good place to work. We were there mid-day on a weekend and the crowd was mostly younger. Good beer selection and they have a 32 oz. bucket gimmick that looks like a good idea if your intention is to get drunk. AND there's a Vegan section on the menu.   Mr. H asked about sides and the waitress said the burritos are huge and a side would go to waste. The burritos are pretty big, but Mr. H needed a few bites of mine and a beer. So if you're a hungry man or have the appetite of one, you might want to order some chips with your burrito, or have two beers. Burritos are Chipotle size.  I ordered the Humanitarian burrito, which is like a salad burrito - fresh, tasty, filling, but still felt healthy-ish. Mr. H's Solo Mexicana burrito was equally tasty and filling, but a little heavier and he loved it. Great vegan variety/options. We will definitely be back and would love to take friends and family here (probably not at night on a weekend, though, because, it's Mill Ave.).  We didn't see the inside, or the roof top patio, but the street level patio is similar to a Dos Gringos without all the bright colors. They had misters on the patio that spray outward in the direction of the sidewalk at chest level, which worked because it was breezy. Smoking could definitely be a problem here because they allow it on the patio and even if someone who's smoking walks by, you can't avoid it. The patio is dog friendly, but it is not enclosed so make sure your pups don't escape and run into traffic!",

The strawberry daiquiri was not frozen but on the rocks and tasted so so however it was pretty potent as far as alcohol content as it felt like a knock out punch to both of us.    We had the pulled pork burrito with cold macaroni and cheese in it.  Neither one of us cared for it.  We also ordered the trio dip: salsa, refried beans, and guacamole.  The salsa was decent, the refried beans was some of the best I've ever had ... so yummy, unfortunately way too much was given and it's not good to eat so much refried beans even if they taste healthy and good.  The guacamole was out of this world.  So fresh tasting.  We both enjoyed this the most.  Waitress Ally was great.  Her personality and demeanor helped us enjoy our time there even more.  We will come back.  Overall I had  really great time here.  Live music ended by the time we arrived at 8:30 PM and we were left without a DJ.  Music could be better. lol.",

They were different and you might have been scared to try them but once you had them you loved them. The Chinese take out and the green chili mac and cheese ones were awesome! However, now I would not come for food. Thier menu options now are very limited. As in 4 options just need to decide if you want it in a burrito, bowl or taco. And the four items they have literally tap basics. So you want steak, chicken, pork or shrimp? Then decide taco, burrito or bowl and that's literally the menu. So you would think with limited items they would master those right? They were ok nothing bad but nothing I'd remember either which is bad if you want repeat business.   Only reason I gave any stars is because staff is always awesome and if all I wanted was to just sit and drink it would be a great place. So yea if you just want drinks, this is a good place. Food, go somewhere else.",

On this night, we were able to sit up at the bar under a heater, which was perfect. This place has a surprisingly nice cocktail menu, with many imaginative options. I had their take on a Moscow mule, the light and stormy. It was fairly tasty, but not fantastic. My friend had their take on a white Russian... and this thing was fabulous! It was a white Russian with rumchata in it and cinnamon on the top.... so good! They also have a wide variety of beers on tap. My friend was talking about one of the beers and before I could tell her to ask for a taster, she had one... now that's good service. I'd like to come back to try some of their interesting food options (mac and cheese burrito... oh ya!).",

The security guard by the bathroom wouldn't let me stand next to the bathroom waiting for my friend. He told me to go back to the club and dance. I expressed not wanting me be alone in a club and feeling safer next to the bathroom and he condescendingly told some other male to come \"kick me out\". It's not against the law to stand next to the bathroom and I have ever right to wait for my friend. The way I was treated was appalling and frankly I was thrilled you're already rated poorly on yelp. I asked for a manager and was hit in the shoulder a few times and shoved out of the patio area. What an unethical way to run a business. Your security is terrible and seem to have zero training on what to invest their negative energy into. A 23year old, 5'4 female is certainly allowed to stand at the end of the men's line- especially for stating \"I don't feel safe, I need to wait here.\" I am going to the BBB with this issue, because others have experienced similar unprofessional behavior.",

I brush off that they even make you take your sunglasses off cuz no biggies but then hey question you on everything else.

I called my friends on the outside and tried to get people's attention. When they finally unlocked the door security very rudely asked me if I even tried unlocking the door and told me there was nothing wrong with the door.  They were not even concerned that I couldn't breathe and was starting to have an anxiety attack. They then kicked me out because they said I was 'too drunk' instead of asking if I was okay.   P.S. A security guard named DJ recognized how poorly the situation was handled. So SHOUT OUT TO DJ FOR BEING NICE!",

    "text": "I went to Casa, ordered my first drink of the night and got squirted with a water gun by someone standing near the entrance of the bar. The water soaked my shirt, shorts, and some of the droplets landed in my crown and coke that I had just ordered.   I got up and walked to the front and asked the guy who squirted me nicely to please not squirt me with the water gun. Turns out after I saw his t-shirt close-up, that he was one of the security guards (Jason).   He explained that he was trying to squirt a female patron that was standing near me. I said no big deal man and please avoid squirting your gun my direction because some of the water landed in my drink and I'll have to order a new one.   I returned to the bar and found my original watered down (literally) drink gone. As I was ordering the replacement, the same security guard came up and said I had to go and tossed his water gun at me. Pretty pathetic that I disrupted his attempt to score with one of the female patrons! At any rate, this was my first and last time visiting this establishment. Typically, immature and childish behavior on this level is attributable to a poor management style.   Fortunately, I make enough money to go to LA or Las Vegas on the weekends which is where I will be going after I move to Phoenix in July and complete the purchase of my new house.  I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. Just imagine if I had been tipsy or intoxicated.. He would have probably called Tempe police and tried to have me arrested.",

The service was good - I thought that the server checked in quite often and was nice. I ordered the pineapple cider, but was slightly disappointed; it was pretty much juice and not much alcohol was evident. I didn't like the drink because it was way too sweet - I would rather buy the ciders from the grocery store than drink at CASA. The prices are on the medium-high range, as expected on Mill,   Nothing was offending about the place, but the reason I'm giving this place three stars is because the bar was just a-ok. I've been to better bars before, and this one just didn't feel special. I wouldn't avoid CASA but I wouldn't seek it either.",

The first time I came in was for one of the infamous burritoes. I was happy to know that they had a large vegan menu because of the vegan chef. I tried the Chinese Take out which was huge and consisted of fried rice, orange tofu and an egg roll. All the other vegan options sounded great so we were excited to come back. This was a few years ago, maybe 2012.  The next time we returned they were out of many things, so I had to get the chinese take out again. It was good, I just expected to try something new.  The next time we went later in the afternoon. Service wasn't great. It seemed as though they were upset we weren't drinking. I get it, but we came for the food. We always tip 20%.  We were driving home from California and wanted a burrito. We called a to go order and none of the vegan items were available. We gave up. Still around 2012.  This past week we called in a to go order at 8:45 PM. I politely asked if they were still serving food, to which they said yes. I am in a local vegan group who has been raving about their new vegan menu. Sadly, I called and they were out of everything but none other than the chinese take out. OK. I ordered it and my husbands non vegan choice. They said it would be 20 minutes.  We showed up at the 22 minute mark and the security looked at my husband and said \"yeah?\" to which my husband said we had a to go order. Not super welcoming. Long story short the food wasn't ready for another 20 minutes.   I'm sad to say that if they actually had the items they so often run out of, it might be worth the drive for us. We now live near Gold Canyon.   Overall, food is meh. Service is not good. Not coming back.",

Read the worst reviews posted here.  They may sound like horror stories but they are the average customer experience at CASA.  Stay away!",

    "text": "YUM. I eat here at least once a week because  cant get enough of the Humanitarian which is grilled veggies, hummus, and chicken.  They  usually have a neat craft beer to offer. . We usually have Brittany as our server and she rocks the house They have switched to an all burrito menu and the concepts are pretty unique.. I like the fact that you can for go the tortilla and just eat the filling. Their green chili mac and cheese is to DIE FOR. The chef  even comes  table side to ensure you've enjoyed your meal. They did make some changes but life is about change and the food is good enough to adapt.",

    "text": "Please stop by c.a.s.a. and see for your self their food is amazing, Mac n cheese burrito with carnitas is to die for, OG burger with a fried egg is the best burger I have ever had no joke, c.a.s.a. loaded fries are crazy good just picture it string fries topped with a four cheese sauce, black beans, pico de gallo, carnitas(shredded pork), bacon and a jalapeno sour cream....mmmmm. Or how about a fresh fruit mojito nice and strong with premium rum. I recommend the rasbery mojito and the orange and cucumber mojito, or how about their 3 amigos premium margarita only 4 dollars. Shots of fireball for only 3 dollars, or a shot of Don Julio blanco for only 5 bucks, you can get a beer and a shot for only seven bucks cant beat that they even have a sky bar on the upper deck where you can get many different sky fusion flavors for only 3 dollars, this is my favorite spot.",
