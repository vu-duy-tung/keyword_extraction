(Quick tip: order a kid's portion)   The breakfast sandwich could easily serve 2, if not 4!   Enjoying a cheese plate at happy hour is a great way to spend an afternoon.   Service is spotty.

The ambiance is one thay feels fancy but yet its like the comfort of your home.  The service received was exceptional, not only did the waitress knowledgable about the menu items she was able to make a recommendation so that I could try both of the items that I was debating.  Our water glasses were never empty. There was just the right amount of checking to ensure our meal was going well without being too intrusive.  The food was more than what was expected.  Having heard great reviews from friends, I was not disappointed.  I tried the pork green chili dish. And I have to say that it actually has become my new favorite, which given its comparison is a huge compliment. I also got to sample the red velvet pancakes with both regular syrup and their special blend.  Wile being delicious by themselves they were phenomenal with the special blend syrup. Adding mango to the traditional orange juice mimosa was very tasty and was a fabulous compliment to the brunch.",

When we arrived they put us at two tables. We asked to be seated at one table and were told that they \"can't accommodate large parties\". No one told us over the phone that we'd be separated when we made the reservation. We asked why we couldn't be seated at one long table when the dining room was currently empty and was told that \"all the empty tables were reserved\". This was a lie. We sat at two separate tables for two hours and many of the tables around us remained empty our entire meal. We even saw a large party of 11 people seated together (we had 14). The manager never came over to speak to us, nor to apologize. The food was cold. The hostess was short and dismissive. I was a long-time fan of this place, but you can bet that none of us will ever return and we have told everyone we know about our terrible experience. It's disappointing that an establishment like this would be so rude to local customers and flat out lie to our face. Don't go here if you have a large party or dislike liars.",

    "text": "I absolutely loved finally getting to The Herb Box, after seeing it so many times of going to ArtBridge Thursdays in the Fall.  Four of us went, for an anniversary dinner.  Looking forward to it for days, and it was well worth going.  As said by others, the ambiance is beautiful... a perfect compliment for Scottsdale weather and surroundings.    We chose early dinner service on a Saturday, happily avoiding rushes or crowds.  The background music was just right too.   In 115 degrees, we only ever consider Inside seating!  So, we were very comfortable, especially with the chairs being wide and nicely cushioned.    Our service was good... very very good when he was at our table.  A few times, he was not around, so we had to ask another server for an extra aioli for the fingerlings, for extra napkins and waited a bit for refills on the raspberry hibiscus iced tea (a really nice tea).   We do not recall the server asking if we wanted refills on the two alcohol beverages.   The water service was on top of things though.    The server was very helpful with letting us know all about the menu... very very helpful with it being our first time.  Every time he was at our table, he was so nice and helpful.  At our table, we had: Fingerling Potatoes with aioli---  Perfectly cooked... But, it was the first sign that I, personally, needed to ask the server to bring salt to the table.  (I always taste my food before adding salt... always hoping I don't need to.)    Cilantro-jalapeno edamame hummus, with grilled naan---  Very tasty!  Butternut Squash Corn Enchiladas--- Good, would like to try something else next time, the server really really pushed it.  Portobello manchego 'burger'--- Delicious  Coffee molasses glazed grilled pork chop--- Good but for about $24, it should have been more than 1 pork chop, coleslaw and two thin slices of sweet potato.  Thai BBQ Baby Back Ribs--- Delicious especially the BBQ sauce on the ribs... it went well with the green apple slaw slices... the Smoked Gouda Mac & Cheese was very very light on the cheese and thank goodness for the panko, that made it worth eating... otherwise, I kinda kept looking for some aspect of it looking cheesy...  it did have a thin cheese sauce,(and it makes sense that this restaurant  does work hard at healthier options... so no blame to them.) I added salt, so that made it better, too.  We all shared a dessert of Tres Leches cake with strawberries.  Very nice and they did make it seem like a lighter option.  A tasty ending.     All in all, very happy with going to The Herb Box... It seems picky to point out the details, but that's where the difference is between Great and WOW I CAN'T WAIT to go back.  This was a very very nice experience, wondering what it would be like to go again.   Oh, yes, it was SUPER GREAT to have such GREAT choices for our vegetarian friends.   That's a huge reason why we picked going there.",

We ordered plaintain chips and hummus for an appetizer, and then I ordered a bunless burger and the partner ordered a ribeye. A few small complaints:  1) They were out of all of the beers my boyfriend tried to order. He tried 5 different beers and they were all out. Granted, after this going on for 10 minutes, they comped his beer so that was great service.  2) I ordered a meal that was gluten-free/dairy-free, and it still came with their fried asparagus (which is a gluten bomb). They were able to give me a side salad instead, which was delicious, but if I had celiac, i wouldn't have been able to eat the burger that was touching this fried side.  Overall, our waitress made up for these things. She was amazing, so friendly, accommodating and gave us honest advice in terms of what to order on the menu. We will be sure to go back for brunch soon! We heard their brunch atmosphere and food is killer! I recommend the Herb Box!",

I ordered the cilantro-crab dip with plantain chips to start. I should've been less greedy as the menu clearly stated apps to SHARE. Nonetheless, it was delicious with lumps of crab swirled in throughout. Definitely recommend!  My main was the goat cheese? And capicola (sp) flatbread topped with crispy kale. My kale was burnt beyond recognition but I just threw it to the side a munched away. Very crunchy flatbread, which is a must, and great ingredients. WAs really tasty!

First they told us it was a 20 minute wait when there were literally 12 tables open inside ( we counted), so we decided to sit at the bar- no one greeted us for 10 minutes no menus nothing. Once sat our waitress was not knowledgeable and somewhat rude. Our food took over 25 minutes to come out and it didn't even come out together ( we are a table of five here not a huge party). No water refills, didn't even ask us if we wanted another drink. Food was mediocre at best this time- something going on in the kitchen we were told... soggy toast on the bottom of a salad and no side with the burger.... had to ask another server for the check and then he disappeared. Returned check with all cash gone and credit cards - bill was overpaid and she was not told to keep the change- when we told her said she would look into it and never came back so we left - it left her with a short tip but she didn't even deserve that. I won't be returning here sad to say... used to be one of my favs",

But the really cool part is that a lot of the side dishes from their menu are available for purchase by the pound deli-style. I have tried the roasted sweet potatoes and the balsalmic beets. Both were really amazing! And I mean that a-ma-zing! I can't believe that I can get a gourmet, healthy and filling lunch with a fresh brewed iced tea for around $10. This is really a great lunch option.   The people working the counter are very friendly and you can tell that they take pride in their work. They also offer samples of the plethora of baked goods they have available. There is also a little section of the market that has some wines, sauces, and olive oils for sale. All of that makes for fun browsing while you wait.",

My fiance and I ordered a lot of food without realizing how much food we actually order so I was great for left overs the next day.  We ordered the pear and gorgonzola flat bread, the crab dip, trout beignets, corn enchiladas, glazed salmon, and the side order of smoked gouda mac n' cheese...all for about $80. So between 2 people and multiple extra servings to take home, it was well worth it. The portions are great and not claim jumper large, the quality is great and the service was awesome as well. The to-go containers were separated and labeled so the hash that came with the salmon was in a separate container and the salad that came with the enchiladas were done in the same manner as well.  I will definitely come back to try more food, but this time we are going to try to not order as much so we have room to try and judge the desserts.",

The food is outstanding (especially the gouda macaroni and cheese!) and the servers are friendly.  The atmosphere for dinner at the location in Old Town is great.  My only complaint is that during our last meal, our server forgot about our appetizer, but was very apologetic and helpful nonetheless.  Sometimes you end up waiting a little longer than you'd want to get your food, but thats how it is at any restaurant, and once your food arrives, it is well worth it anyways.  Very impressed, and will be sure to come back soon!  Try: The open faced Kobe Burger (if available)         The Gouda Mac N Cheese!         The Ribs!          The Apple-slaw",

We then shared a small plate of Brussel Sprout \"chips\" which were also very well done--the addition of the vegan aioli was a good combination.

The menu offers a wide range of foodie friendly comfort food that will satisfy the vegetarian and omnivore alike.  There was also a good list of mixed drinks.  I would recommend the sangria over the mojito.  I had the ribs and macaroni and cheese with bread crumbs.  The bread crumbs make it fancy.  There is some great outdoor seating when the weather is accommodating.  The restaurant is on the Scottsdale waterfront.  I don't quite get the fake herbs as a center piece of each table, but the restaurant does seem to be surrounded by an herb garden.  There's a bakery down stairs that makes some of the menu items.  I'm sure we'll be back, and may even take the parents next time they are in town, if you get my drift.",

It wasn't too busy so we were promptly greeted & were seated at a table right away. Our drink orders were taken; my friend who normally gets the mango lemonade ordered it, and I'm so glad I decided to follow suite. I'll admit that throughout our meal I may or may not have had 3 glasses of it ... It was so good!  For my meal, I ordered the blackened salmon blt sandwich. I'm not sure that I've ever had bacon with salmon before (it was a little bit on the salty side) but it was pretty good. I'd consider asking them to lightly season the salmon next time (or leave the bacon off) as I preferred the taste of the red pepper aioli that was on the sandwich. The best part however, was probably the side of sweet potato chips. They were the perfect crunchy bites to accompany the sandwich.  Unfortunately, the service wasn't that great. We had to flag down our waitress a couple of times to get drink refills & get us our checks, etc. but I've heard some great brunch recommendations such as the red velvet pancakes & the french toast, so for the food I'll be back.",

Only complaint was the edamame was fried which breaks open the shell so most of the beans were missing -_- not to mention the unnecessary oil intake. They had a couple other vegan options which I'd like to try too. Somewhat expensive, $45 for the board (basically a shared appetizer) and 2 drinks.

We actually ate inside the market which I'm not sure if people do because we were not aware there was a whole other seating area but it was great. We made sure to order off the menu not the food they had on display. I ordered soba noodles with broccoli zucchini and a few other veggies (I ordered it without the hard boiled egg). My cousin ordered the avocado love I believe which was avocado toast with arugula piled on top.   When we finally tried our meals we were very disappointed that we didn't live in Phoenix the food was AMAZING! It was all very fresh, home grown ingredients and it was very obvious in the flavors. Im not a fan of avocado but I'd eat that avocado toast all day!  We needed to try more so we shared a bowl of tomato basil and artichoke soup which was also SO GOOD! We even took some sweet potato chips to go and gave them to family as a little something from Phoenix and everyone wanted more!   Be sure to stop by!! You won't regret it!!",

Even without the 10% rose-colored-glasses boost, however, this place rocks. I got a Bloody Mary (spicy and peppery, as it should be!) and the short rib tacos and oh my god. Put the short rib tacos in your face as soon as you can, and as often as you can. My boyfriend got the chilaquiles and they looked good, but I was too busy in the midst of my love affair with the short rib tacos to sample any.  We sat outside, and the ambiance was great. Old Town (I think that's where this is? #tourist) is adorable and walking around near the restaurant was interesting. It also doesn't hurt to be eating brunch outside in 80-degree weather in October.",

    "text": "Located in the charming old town of Scottsdale, this restaurant has a fun, hipster vibe with trendy decor and an adventurous menu. I made reservations and was seated outside in the courtyard. The waiter was friendly and helpful, so I anticipated a great evening.  First of all, don't be fooled by the name--the dishes are far from healthy and fresh. It took me quite some time to settle on the steak salad. Most of the dishes were smothered in sauces, and quite unappealing.  The salad came out (thankfully I ordered the sauce and dressing on the side) and I was pleasantly surprised by its appearance. All of that went downhill as soon as I took a bite. The meat tastes like it had been marinating for days. The flavor was muddled and flat. I ate the salad and half way through, felt very sick. When I went to the bathroom, I was horrified by what I found. Dirty, old fixtures and and unkept space. I usually judge the cleanliness of a restaurant by its bathrooms, so this was highly disappointing.  If they put so little effort into keeping the visible spaces clean, how are they up keeping the kitchen? My suspicions were further heightened when I spent most of the night sick from the odd meat that graced my salad. I will not be returning.",

    "text": "The Italian Festival next door was providing classic old school Italian music while we enjoyed a fresh lunch on a beautiful Spring day in Old Town Scottsdale. The open air restaurant upstairs had live music and a nice vibe.   Deciding to eat at the downstairs deli, we were pleasingly surprised with the quality of the \"deli\" food.    The Butternut squash enchilada  made with a corn tortilla, fresh corn and perhaps gouda cheese really hit the spot?  Next up was a Turkey-berry -jalepino-brie-arugula sandwich that sounds like a mouthful but was actually quite light and delicate. The Gouda mac and cheese was not good at all, in fact very dry.   We ordered a number of sides: the Szechuan Green Beens had a nice crunchy kick, and the Edamame Salad and Roasted Cauliflower were both fresh and filling.  It was a hot day so having Orange San Pellegrino was a treat. The deli is  not full service but they gladly gave us extra plates and removed our dirty dishes.",

    "text": "july 8, 2012  For my birthday brunch, I ordered four menu items to share amongst everyone, which included the red velvet pancakes (but of course!), the Herb Tomato, goat cheese, and chive omelet, the Market BLT (I've tried it before, and it was fantastic!), and a new addition to the menu, one I'd wanted to try for two years now, but I keep missing the opportunity-- the Bourbon-ginger peach brioche French toast!  I also ordered two mango mimosas for my cousin and me (Mom and aunt did not want any)...  What more can I say about the red velvet pancakes that I haven't said before? <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=25P_k0Ot6qR9aV5IYzGTVQ#25P_k0Ot6qR9aV5IYzGTVQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXY...</a>  Just order them when you go, and thank me later.  I skipped on the omelet this time <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=YO8Ft30ml8XwNW4K2Drq3Q#YO8Ft30ml8XwNW4K2Drq3Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXY...</a>, since I had only one thing on my mind, and it was the French toast... OMG! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=pC5n1Ejy5dpyvZQlY1uTBQ#pC5n1Ejy5dpyvZQlY1uTBQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXY...</a>  This is how French toast should be prepared-- crispy, yet not greasy, on the outside and tender, not fluffy, on the inside.  The ratio of custard batter to bread was spot-on.  Nothin'  soggy 'bout it.  Oh, and the bourbon-ginger peach compote that was the crux of the entree?  Superb!  Yeah, I had to ask for another pot of this.  Hey, I'll take a couple of jars home, if you got some to sell!  I seriously hope I never have to choose between the red velvet pancakes and the French toast, because I wouldn't, COULDN'T begin to contemplate.  The only disappointment during the whole meal was the Street Market BLT. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=L03fNbFT9uWaiI69ELoUFw#L03fNbFT9uWaiI69ELoUFw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXY...</a>  While the ingredients- pancetta, wild arugula, tomato, ricotta, and a fried egg (mmm... there's something about arugula and fried egg together...) tasted fantastic, the bread was over-charred, and it just almost ruined the dish.  I just peeled the bread back and ate the goodness in between.  Hmm... yeah.  'Tis best not to go there.  Mango mimosas for $5 a pop?  I see many more Sundays off from work in my future!  p.s.  Thank you Shad, and THB, for my glorious red velvet birthday cupcake! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=dk-G0E6bgC4JoZOQBPaqfQ#dk-G0E6bgC4JoZOQBPaqfQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXY...</a>  Three of us kept going back to the plate for more, and there were still leftovers... You were so right-- the cream cheese frosting was spectacular!",

Service was great except for the last time I was there my food took exceptionally longer than anyone else's which was a bit frustrating. All the mimosas are fantastic. Love the look of this place. I want to try their bakery and coffee section at some point, but the restaurant is awesome overall.",

    "text": "This Is Food And Atmosphere Heaven!  I took a friend here on Monday for his birthday lunch. He had been to the Herb Box before and when I suggested it, he had nothing but great things to say about it. This was a perfect place to take someone who had chosen to focus their diet on staying healthy. Then menu is extensive enough so that there is something for everyone.   We had not made a reservation, but were promptly seated out on the upstairs patio in the shade where we could enjoy the perfect weather. The overall feel of the place was just right from the moment we walked into the market downstairs throughout the entire meal. The atmosphere was calm, and everyone was friendly and attentive.   Within a minute of our being seated, our server arrived to take beverage orders and to ask if we had questions about the menu so far. We ordered Mango Lemonade and settled in to make our lunch selections. Our beverages came out in a matter of minutes.  It was SO HARD for each of us to pick just one menu item. I really wanted to try the Korean Fried Cauliflower, and the Grow Happy Garden Salad was seriously calling my name, perhaps with some salmon. The only way I managed to choose was by promising myself I would come back again soon to try them. Because I was starving, I settled on the Urban Market Steak Salad. My friend settled on the Serrano-Avocado Shrimp Salad and a side of Smoked Gouda Mac & Cheese. We considered ordering the Korean Fried Cauliflower as an appetizer, but I just don't have a large enough appetite to eat that much. We had barely decided on our selections when our server returned to refill our lemonade and take our orders.   We settled in to chat and enjoy the environment while we waited for our food. The weather was lovely, and it was quiet enough that we could talk comfortably.   Our food came out quickly and looked wonderful. The steak on my salad was perfectly medium rare as I had requested it, and the rest of the salad was fresh and flavorful with lots of wonderful ingredients in each bite. We both stopped talking and gave our attention entirely to our food for several minutes before relaxing back into our conversation again. Mango Lemonade refills continued to appear on a regular basis.  Our lunch experience was so relaxing and palate pleasing that we completely lost track of time as we finished our food and soaked up the atmosphere. We could have been in and out in under an hour, but we lingered for two.  I had expected to experience service issues based on many of the reviews I read before selecting the Herb Box for lunch, but our service was excellent. Perhaps lunchtime on Monday afternoons is the perfect time. I know I'll be there again next Monday. I'll be having the Grow Happy Garden Salad with salmon!",

    "text": "Almost completely unimpressed. The menu is pretty interesting but doesn't contain nearly as many vegan/vegetarian options as I thought it would. The cocktails are probably the best part about the menu. Every drink is a modern take on a classic.   My girlfriend and I had a vegan platter that game with a couple small dishes of hummus, green beans, and something else that I can't recall. All were fairly good but it was twenty bucks for two people to feel mildly full. I usually don't complain about the size of the dishes (Americans are obviously confused about portion size compared to the rest of the planet, save for Mexico) but these were just...tiny. They were served in sauce cups or something.  The service was fine, but the guys who were working when I came through were the type you'd expect to find at a local bar like Hi-Fi or RnR. Tattooed, heavily-gelled hair and talking to the girls at the bar pretty much constantly.   The decor is easily the coolest thing about the restaurant. It sits on the second floor by that bridge in old town Scottsdale, and at night it was a romantic place to have a fifty-dollar dinner that didn't fill me up.",

The salad with filet mignon that I ordered was a decent portion for lunch.  Since it was meant to be mainly a salad, I shouldn't have been disappointed that the filet was on the smaller end of the spectrum.  The tenderness was exactly as I ordered - which earned another star.    The price is on the higher end for what you get, but the quality was good.",

The meat was fall off the bone perfect and juicy. Perfect is perfect! With a good cocktail,  Pama vodka and a nice simple single malt. What more can you say! I will tell you - Chocolate desserts that are chocoholic quality. Park the car and come on in!",

I asked if they had quiche or anything that didn't have bread and he said that they were so busy yesterday and usually their product lasts a few days so they don't prep everyday so they were pretty much out of everything. The only breakfast item they had was the breakfast panini and it couldn't be modified because it was already made.  I completely understand the idea of having things pre made so that it's a quick process which is their concept here.  What I am not understanding is pre making everything and keeping it for days and if you are out on a Sunday wouldn't you prep Monday morning?  I got a breakfast panini and a bowl of soup it was ok.  Nothing to great.  The only great thing about this place is the location and the patio.  Service and food need some serious revamping.",

    "text": "I should probably disclose one little detail about how I rate my food - I don't like looking at food that has been through several handling processes. I love it when you can look at a plate or bowl and see what's on/in it. What makes up the sauce? What's in the soup? You should be able to know what you're eating!  For this reason, I really enjoy The Herb Box.   Salads, Sandwiches, Wraps, Flatbreads, variations of hummus and always a kickass soup of the day - pick anything off of the menu and you can't go wrong!  I have recently enjoyed lunch and they've changed some things around the physical space since my last visit - and created a dedicated dining room on one side and moved the market over to the kitchen's space. Great idea and what a perfect opportunity to create more seating!   Food: 5 stars Tzatziki and Pita, Zuccini, Tomato and Corn Soup garnished with Feta Cheese and my beverage was an Aranciata San Pelligrino Soda   Service: 3.5 stars (Efficient and definitely warmed up to me as the meal continued)  Atmosphere: 3.5 stars (Please place a top-weight on the slamming door)  = 4 stars",

    "text": "Adorable little lunch spot for flavorful appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and a few full entrees.      Homemade sweet potato chips were tasty but not too heavy, and we both loved my butternut squash corn enchiladas - the tomatillo verde sauce really made it stand out, and I love how the tortillas were baked until the ends were slightly crispy.  Side salad was a perfect complement with those cute little crispy tortilla strips that I can't find in grocery stores.    The falafel with pita was fairly good but was almost too small for anyone with a normal appetite (only 3 small falafel croquettes).  Although we did not have beer/wine there were a handful of choices, and I was pleased to see Hoegaarden, Anchor Steam, and a few other craft beer choices.    Restaurant is divided into two areas, one with small seating & kitchen/bar that leads to a covered hallway with outdoor seating, followed by the main dining area with numerous tables.  Decor somewhat suggested a homestyle European feel but I could be off on that.  Location is actually a good couple of tenths of a mile west of Shea inside a small shopping area just off Shea, and it's on the eastern side of this shopping area.  Parking is excellent, and this is an underappreciated feature of restaurants today.  I was hoping for breakfast like the other location, and it was disappointing to note that they're only open for lunch as well.  Portion sizes could have been larger, especially for the entree prices, or conversely the prices could have been more modest given the size of the orders.  I'm not sure what the norm is way up north of the 101 on Pima, but around Shea/Scottsdale there are a lot of delicious choices for less.    Nonetheless, I'll be back to try several other items and will probably go here as a top choice whenever I crave butternut squash/corn enchiladas.",

I have eaten in as well as to go many times and yesterday stopped by and took home the Turkey Avocado wrap, sweet potato chips and Oatmeal cookie (so large I could only have a few bites)... I couldn't help but have a cheat meal I hadn't been in awhile!  DELICIOUS!!     I normally do NOT order wraps anywhere, but they are so wonderful here!  Again I do not usually get desert but their cookies are wonderful, the oatmeal cookie really tastes like oatmeal and raisins instead of a pile of sugar.  Everything is so fresh and high quality..... Did I mention they have Diet Coke, a must in my book...... and it is free refills which isn't out of the ordinary, but the specialty is it is poured from the CAN!  The most amazing little restaurant!  I love the feeling I have when I am there!  It is a place you want to bring a book and enjoy alone or with friends.  It is small but that is the attraction.  To Go is always great at this restaurant, not like others where you do not get the same quality!  This might be because they are a catering company.  I am new to Arizona and miss having lunch with my girlfriends.  When I come here not only is the food wonderful I feel like I am a part of something.  It's Great!  P.S.  I see there is a location in DC Ranch now and looks like it is more than just a lunch place, I will have to try this but for now only have experienced the original.....  Love IT!  :)",

We sat inside in a cute little corner of the restaurant and started with tasty tropical iced tea and enjoyed amazing red pepper hummus and pita chips to start. For my meal I had some kind of a \"sunshine\" or \"sunflower\" salad that had chicken, goat cheese, sunflower seeds, dried strawberries and spinach-it was AMAZING! The actual salad came with Bacon but I took mine without. The main thing I noticed about my meal was how fresh everything was! Not to tip my own hat but I make pretty amazing salad's so its hard for me to justify spending money on one that I can make twice as good at home but honestly The Herb Box did it! Unique fresh flavors and all without me having to whip out my cutting board!   I had been wanting to try this place for so long and I am so excited to have finally taken advantage!

In fact, I consciously make efforts at work to not expose too many people to it, because I don't want the entire company discovering my secret lunch place!  Also, it's important to note that this restaurant's title in Yelp is confusing -- they started as a catering company and the food was so amazing that they opened a little takeout marketplace.  The marketplace got so popular that they bought the space next door and opened a little bistro as well--with which I have lot's of experience!  Yes, the sweet potato chips are to die for (and are often the tipping point decision between ordering a wrap or a salad).  My favorite menu item is the turkey/apple/swiss wrap (has cashews and lot's of mixed greens in it, really yum) but highly encourage trying their specials, which are always fantastic.    They offer iced green tea that is really tasty, and have a small beer/wine/drink menu as well.  The DC Ranch location is confirmed, which is awesome--I could definitely see this place expanding throughout the valley:  the fresh, healthy food they offer combined with the charming atmosphere often makes a visit to this bistro the highlight of my day.",

The filling was generous and tasty with a nice balance of flavors and textures.  The place is cute and service was very friendly.",

Went last week and was blown away by their delicious vegan and vegetarian items. We had the KALE, CORN & SWEET ONION PAKORA for our starter and I now crave this item on a daily  basis. I literally have no idea what a Pakora is but I'd eat it with a spoon. The VEGAN NOSH BOARD is also unbelievably good and more than a full meal. You will not go home hungry.  Service was great, their new location offers a large patio area. Super happy I went back!",

At which point I saw the bartender hadn't even started them. The server even skipped some of the people that we are dining with when taking the drink orders to go to another table? Who does that mid round? If you expect good service go somewhere else. That's the entire point of dining out.",

The cauliflower was not gf so I did not have it but my guys loved it. It came on a bed of quinoa which was simple but good. The kale pakoras were excellent and crispy, the Brussels sprout chips were crunchy and flavourful and the edamame was mildly flavoured but delicious. The pakoras and Brussels sprouts had an aioli type sauce with them.  Unfortunately, beyond these apps there was nothing else for me to order. I even went down to their little cafe to see if I could have anything from there but everything else that was vegetarian had dairy in it. Luckily it was still happy hour so I got another order of the pakoras and Brussel sprouts for $5 each. The problem was that all these items were deep fried and I felt nauseous after. Hubby had the ribs but couldn't eat the Mac and cheese with it. My son enjoyed his shrimp. Hubby enjoyed 2 drinks for $6 each during happy hour which ends promptly at 6pm.  For dessert we shared the only gf, vegan dessert...the pumpkin cheesecake. I was not a fan....it was dense and tasted ok, but did not satisfy my sweet tooth. The restaurant is trendy and open, with a nice patio area. The staff are nice and the washrooms are large and clean.",

We had a fork battle to see who could get the last bite off of the plate. Wow.   Then, I had the crispy chicken blt. But instead of having fried chicken, I had them grill it instead. They were really nice about doing that sub for me. The sandwich was exactly what I needed. The basil-garlic mayo was SO good. MM.. I wish I could have taken that home with me. The sandwich could have stood alone, but it came with sweet potato chips. The chips were also really good but because the sandwich was so big, I didn't really need the chips.   I would give this place a five star rating, but I felt like the service was slightly lacking. It was a bit cold outside, and instead of turning on the heater right by us for US, they dragged it across the patio for another table to use. I was bummed by this because I was cold and hungry. Thankfully, they ended the hungry part but I was still cold!",

    "text": "Vegetarian and gluten free heaven! We had lunch on a beautiful sunny Scottsdale afternoon. Beautiful restaurant inside and in the outside seating area. I had the Grow Happy salad, one of the freshest salads ever with house made honey lemon dressing and the sweet potato tacos with mango and black bean salsa, just a perfect vegetarian dish and done gluten free as well! Hubby had short rib enchiladas which he said were excellent! Only reason I'm not giving  five stars is because I was up charged $3.50 for hot water, who does that? Seriously!  Make sure you visit the bakery and market next-door! They had several gluten-free options, great  coffee and tea selections and lots of healthy eating options as well! We thoroughly enjoyed our coffee and desserts sitting outside in their lovely patio area. We will definitely be returning on our next trip to Scottsdale!",

I was concerned initially when I read bad reviews on the service. One of the best waiters I have every had. Kendal! You were wonderful! My daughter is a waitress and she can be hard to please. She was very impressed. We started with the brussel sprout chips. They were good. I have to be gluten free so my options can be limited. These were a good choice. For our main courses we had the sweet potato bowl and the smoked salmon hash. We were both pleased. I have to admit it took a long time to decide because they had so many drool worthy options to choose from. I also had the melon mule. Very refreshing! Sit outside if you can. Great people watching and umbrellas shade you. Once again Kendal was great but so was everyone else. His is the only name we got. Go! Great service and great food!",

It's right off the canal, a short walk to the mall and it has super comfy chairs. Organic coffee with refills - YES! I recommend this as your little coffee shop nook hide-away.

The trout itself was fine, the pesto didn't add much for me.  The corn gratin was disappointing, bland, and mushy.  It came out very cold in the middle so I had to send it back.    Husband had the rib entree.  They were fine, slathered with a spicy BBQ sauce.    The waiter forgot to place order for our appetizer, but was very apologetic and took it off the bill.

    "text": "Highly disappointed in the level of service from my past experience. I would not suggest going here to anyone using a stroller, wheelchair or any form of that nature. Staff members just looked at us as we tried to figure out how to get our stroller up all their stairs they have and never once said can I help you or are you looking for a table or any type of acknowledgement.  My mom went to the hostess and tried to get a table, sure enough we asked to be seated outside since we were carrying the stroller up all those stairs. The hostess said the only table available was next to the hostess stand outside which would mean carrying the stroller up a few more set of stairs... Mind you that there were five other tables outside with no one sitting at them or no reserved signs. At this point in time my dad found the ramp entrance into the back of the restaurant where an employee could have directed us but passing 5 workers from the entire time being no one said one thing to us that in that direction we have a ramp or stroller access... of course we weren't looking to sit next to the hostess stand we settled to sit inside. Thanks to the hostess who put us right by the front door with our stroller and who was pleasant to throw the menus on the table and not move a chair out of the way for us to put our stroller. No problem I guess it's my job as the customer to move my own chair at the table to the middle of the walk way and let you guys figure out where it should go. It was so bad I couldn't believe I sat there and had lunch. I was fired up with the first 3 mins of being here and how no staff member could even say one word or acknowledge us with seeing we had a stroller. Friendliness 0,  Accommodating 0, Likeliness to come back Never.",

I got the Market Street Short Rib Tacos and they were tastyyyyy. A bit messy since short rib juices was kinda leaky but it is definitely a must try! The menu here is incredibly extensive and there are so many other items to choose from! I want to try the Chicken Arugula goat cheese wrap, the Korean Cauliflower Quinoa Bowl, and Pear & Gorgonzola Flatbread. If I lived in the area, I would probably be here all the time stuffing my face until I popped. The ambiance of The Herb Box is amazing and the bathrooms are pretty awesome. Definitely a place to try out if you've never been and a place I will return to. =]  PS. If you enter from the first floor, I believe that is their mini cafe. If you want to eat at the actual restaurant you'll have to go up to the second floor!",

The herb box is a superior restaurant because of the fine nuances in the dishes which only are created by a chef who has studied flavor and texture.  Their sides can stand on their own. The desserts are lacking, but this is forgivable as I imagine the chef skipped dessert classes to focus on the main course. Overall an excellent restaurant and worthy of five stars.",

Last night with #canalconvergence going on, we wandered through the public art and then looked for a place to eat. Everything was super busy but the Herb Box had an acceptable wait time and room at the bar. The drinks menu has a great variety. My husband ordered a super hoppy IPA while I indulged in their lemon basil martini. The pours were generous. After about 30 minutes we were seated at a great table where we could hear dinner conversation. The doors were open to the outdoors and it was a great setting. My husband was really happy with the Thai ribs. I ordered the Cauliflower steak. It is a gorgeous dish. In fact, I should have posted a photo except that I am tired of people taking pictures of their food in restaurants. Trust me, it looks and tastes amazing. Roasted cauliflower on a bed of black lentils garnished with roast brussel leaves and some type of savory mustard sauce. Oh, and pickled grapes! A surprisingly wonderful addition.   We got a couple of sides - everything was very good. The last elusive star is retained because I felt like we could have been seated a lot faster. Table service was very good. We'll go back.",

I was debating between the Butternut Squash Enchiladas or the Sweet Potato Tacos. Our server recommended the Sweet Potato Tacos, so I ordered those. Sweet potatoes are my favorite vegetable, and I was glad I chose to order the tacos. They were very fresh and flavorful. Herb Box is pricey though!

Great service and the waiter (Andy?) was not only one of the most helpful waiters (in terms of being honest about his favorites on the menu) but also one of the funniest. So much so that I asked him if he thought about being a stand up comedian (which usually doesn't across as a compliment but was one). I had the advocado love which was three slightly toasted servings of advocado with some arugula and a few green jalepenos (which I wasn't aware of until I bit on one...). Only negative about that dish which was delicious is that I wish the bread was slightly more toasted so it would hold the advocado and salad better. I also ordered the smoked gouda mac and cheese. I'm familiar with gouda as it's basically a staple cheese where I grew up similar to cheddar here and it was as close to being perfect as it could be. Served with some bread crumbs and really delicious. The gf had a flatbread,corn and goat cheese which was equally as good. I'm not much for desserts for the most part and the dessert menu did look great, but the gf managed to request one, the smorees creme brulee. I'm not sure it was a complete success...edible yes but most creme brulee comes somewhat warm and the consistency was good but more like a pudding than what I was expecting. I love bread pudding but didn't try it and the serve highly recommended the crack pie which I'll have to come back for and test out. Despite the somewhat pricey menu, I'd say it was a pleasant surprise and well worth all the reviews and high marks.",

We started out with a wonderful cocktail with meyer lemons.  We had the beet salad and the roast grapes bruschetta for small plates.  A great start followed by the sublime roasted chicken with tomato/gorgonzola butter, green bean/fingerling potato salad and roasted brussels sprouts.  We finished with beetroot chocolate cake. Yumm!  Just writing it makes me want to eat it all over again.",

    "text": "So we were walking around old town during our weekend visiting Scottsdale and we stumbled upon this place as being one of the few places that was open on a Sunday morning at 9 am. Great stumble on our part! It was a gorgeous day so we sat on the outdoor patio. Our waitress was lovely and she mentioned that they had a brunch special for $24 which included bottomless mimosas and an entree each. Sounds good to me! We got our drink on and couldn't decide on what we wanted to eat because everything on the menu sounded utterly delish! We finally chose the Avocado love and the corn and goat cheese flatbread. The portions are VERY large so we really could have split one of these dishes between the two of us and been fine but I'm glad we were able to try both of them. The avocado love consists of slices of bread slathered with avocado and topped with a fried egg, arugula and yellow pepper aioli.YUM-ME. Everything was ridiculously fresh and tasty. The corn and goat cheese flatbread had tomato, red onion and bacon and was topped with arugula as well. I can never get enough of it so it was all good with me! Again a VERY large portion. We sucked down a few more mimosas and were fat and happy all day long. GREAT place! The only tiny little glitch was the prosecco or whatever the mimosas were made with was very sweet.",

Besides the cold atmosphere, the service was slow, and we were 1 one 2 tables in the restaurant, and the menu was disapointing for dinner.

I got a (smallish) grilled cheese/caramelized onion/apple sandwich, cup of potato leek soup, and side salad for $15, but more to the point, it was all great. We sat on the very nice patio and they didn't give us any attitude for being all scruffy and probably a bit smelly post-Camelback Mt. hike. Don't miss the absurdly fancy bathroom. (Warning about the patio - the table next to us was being dive-bombed by aggro birds. Apparently it has something to do with ordering Diet Coke and saccharin?) My husband said his grilled chicken sandwich was great too, and his crispy potatoes were AWESOME. VERY close to five stars overall. I guess I'm holding back on that 5th star because service was a bit slow (a lot of \"I'll be right back with that\"... and 10 minutes go by), but we were at the end of the lunch rush and luckily not in a hurry. Very pleasant meal and a highlight of our trip to AZ.",

We did get asked twice within a 2 minute period (right after we got our food) if the food was good, but one of the servers was training so it was probably just practice. I ordered the Coconut Shrimp Salad, which was wonderful except the Shrimp were way over cooked (almost burnt) and really not palatable. I would definitely give them another shot though because everything else was so good. My guy ordered a wrap and mowed through half of it there and the other half shortly after we left and had no complaints, I tried the wrap too and it was very tasty and crisp. There is an awesome little market extension to this place that is also definitely worth checking out, and save room after you eat if you do go, because like us, you will be VERY tempted to try one of the delicious treats inside! Unfortunately for us we didn't save room, so I guess we'll just have to go back again soon!",

    "text": "The folks at The Herb Box have decided to bring their own brand of goodness to Old Town Scottsdale, by opening up a new location, and we couldn't be more excited. Located at Southbridge (7134 E. Stetson Drive) The Herb Box is now open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. For those of you who have never been to their DC Ranch location, you are in for a treat. The Herb Box specializes in some of the best appetizers, sandwiches, enchiladas and flatbreads around and puts their own unique twist on these familiar favorites.  Try the Butternut Squash Corn Enchiladas with tomatillo verde fiesta salad covered in red peppers, cotija and sugared pecans, it is a personal favorite. If a sandwich is what you are in the mood for Schmooze recommends Roasted Turkey, Pear and Arugula or the Blackened Chicken Caesar Wrap. Stressful day, need a time-out, be sure to ask for the progressive wine list featuring over 40 wines by the glass to go along with your lunch.  Speaking of wine (okay so we love Happy Hour) Happy Hour is from 3 - 6 pm, Mon - Sat with $2 off appetizers, $5 glass of wine or $3 microbrews. The Happy Hour specials change daily, but your server will be delighted to give you a take-away menu so that you can plan your afternoons accordingly.  Friday is a can't miss day with $9 Sesame Seared Ahi and $6 Blackberry Mojitos.  Can it get any better then this! Yes, yes it can.... Reverse Happy Hour Fri/Sat from 10 am - 12 noon. Happy, happy dance!  The Herb Box is also your destination for breakfast (served 8 -11 am), where you can have a wonderful breakfast on the front patio with a $5 Bloody Mary or Mimosa.  Feeling adventurous, try a strawberry or blueberry Mimosa to go along with some Cinnamon Buckwheat Pancakes! O-tay! The Chilequiles with egg, corn tortilla and pulled pork are also high on our list of recommendations. Sunday Brunch is also served from 8 am - 3pm for the brunch crowd.  In keeping with the DC Ranch arrangement, The Herb Box also has a market that features the same menu as the regular restaurant as well as boxed lunches ready to grab and go if you find yourself in a hurry.",

    "text": "Oh jeez, folks, I wanted to be able to give it 5 stars but I just can't.  It wasn't a 5 star meal or experience.  I'm giving it 4 because our server was nice and the space is welcoming but it really may be closer to a 3.5.   The atmosphere reminds me of Palatte except inside and with full table service not half counter/half table.  (I was actually expecting it to be counter service but was pleasantly surprised.)  Its eclectic and warm but unlike Palatte you can't purchase the chair you are sitting in if you like it.  Its very small and cozy but that means that it fills up quickly if you are planning to dine in. The service was attentive although the entire experience was slower than we thought, especially during the lunch hour.  We were there over an hour!  For someone on a lunch break if may not be the best choice.    We started with the hummus which was just ok- its not nearly as good as the hummus at Fez.  The pita chips it was served with were the thickest and hardest pita chips I've ever eaten in my life.  I wouldn't suggest the hummus, you can get better roasted red pepper hummus at TJ's.  (Oh wait, none of the TJ's here carry it...)  My husband selected the \"Brown Sugar Jerk Pork\" which was not jerk pork at all.  It was pulled pork and the gouda was almost non-existent.  He said he thought he tasted it in a few bites, but never actually saw it. (Then bread turned really soggy and the whole thing fell apart)  My sandwich was a similar experience.  Like Megan, I ordered the Grilled Chicken and Sage Pesto.  All it really tasted like was chicken and goat cheese with the occasional taste of apple.  The pesto was not existent and the only time I realized there was bacon in the sandwich was when I crunched down on the random hard pieces of it.  For the amount of ingredients in the sandwich it was no way near as flavorful as it should have been.  I don't think I'm ready to marry this sandwich at all, but I may consider seeing it casually on the side.  Only if we can date other people though.",

That being said, it took 45 minutes for our food to come out..we were the first ones there! When the food came out my husbands was a completely wrong order. My daughter got the red velvet pancakes. When I tried to cut them for her I noticed they were very tough, and when I flipped them over they were burnt on the back. When we could flag down a waiter (5 minutes later) we had to send my husbands and my daughters food back. I got the smoked salmon hash. It was the most dissapointing brunch dish I have ever had. It was essentially dry potatoes mixed with dry smoked salmon. Salmon is my favorite food, so it was especially upsetting. My husband finally got his short rib sandwich, we he admitted was horribly dry. I couldn't even finish my food. I should have known better when it was the only restaurant with reservations open for Mother's day when all other restaurants were booked. I will not be returning.",

    "text": "I don't think words can really express my long-term love for The Herb Box.  Back when I lived in Phoenix, I probably visited The Herb Box about 3-4 times a month (and oft resisted going even more frequently).  Ambiance: It's everything you want in a cute lunch place.  You can see and be seen, hide away in a corner, or enjoy misters outside.  The place has character, the sweets are displayed for you to devour with your eyes, and it's relaxing to be there.  Appetizers: The Roasted Red Pepper Hummus is a MUST HAVE.  Served with fresh, home-made pita chips (often still warm) and a wonderful, substantive hummus with a bit of a bite, I can't get enough.  Entree: My die-hard favorite (and what I would eat as my last meal on earth) is the Grilled Chicken and Sage Pesto Sandwich (without the greens).  It's beautiful, white meat chicken on ciabatta, with a pesto spread, fresh bacon bits, sliced apple, and goat cheese.  Served with a side of fresh and crisp sweet potato chips, the contrast and deliciousness is amazing.  Simply unbeatable.  Dessert:  They have a chef who specializes and clearly rejoices in making sweets, so they always have something different to choose from.  Check out the options while you're there to decide.  Some of my favorites have been: Whoopie Pies, Almond Chocolate Chip Cookies, and Espresso Cookies.  Service:  The servers are always friendly and helpful.  Get to know them and you get even better service.  Marlee, who's been my favorite server for the last 3 years, is out of this world and super friendly.  The owner is also often there and is very sweet.  The Market:  I used to get take out from The Herb Box all the time and let me tell you: it's just as delicious at home or at the office.  Anyway, you pick it up on The Market side of the establishment, where you can also find tons of other ready-made tasties to go.  They sell their super fresh, beautifully dusted sweet potato chips there in larger bags.  It's definitely worth stopping by.  Catering:  The Herb Box actually stared as a catering company and I've had them cater several parties.  Their staff is ultra-friendly and accommodating and will remember you afterwards when you stop in the restaurant too.  They put out a beautiful spread of sandwiches, wraps, cheese spreads, and whatever else you ask for!  This place is a must visit if you live in Arizona or visit Phoenix or Scottsdale.  Do whatever it takes to get yourself there and become as obsessed as I am.  If you're wondering what their current sweet is or if anything new is going on with them, check them out on twitter: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.twitter.com%2Ftheherbbox&s=0b14b63ddcd13f2233f95cd36be7c4399654c8b74f78179f72462ad346204768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">twitter.com/theherbbox</a>",

I am sad to say that we were GREATLY disappointed.:(  The outside patio looked great, so we opted to sit outside...turned out to be a bad idea: the seats were all stained and dirty, and the music outside was extremely loud. (this was a Wed. night) I don't care to have Leeann rimes blasting in my ears while I am trying to eat! We decided to start with the falafel bites and the short rib tacos (based on our server and Phx magazines recommendations).The falafel bites were very bland and tasted like they had been sitting around--they were cold and unappetizing. The tacos didn't taste horrible, but there was no depth whatsoever to the flavor-again very boring.  So, we decided to cut our losses and asked for our check...there was no way we were going to spend any more money on ok food!! So disappointed that the Herb box didn't deliver. It's a good thing that Citizen Public House was nearby!! Citizen Public house rescued us and saved our date night!!!",

Hostesses were quite welcoming, but we found the dining room to be sterile and lacking warmth. Ordered the breakfast burrito...worst I have ever tasted. It was just a whole lot of egg in a tortilla. There were supposed to be black beans and queso, but there were about 5 beans, and a tiny sprinkle of queso on top. It desperately needed some salt and pepper...but not one salt and pepper shaker could be found in the entire dining room.....and our server had disappeared too. The salsa was horrible. Finally found the server and asked for some pico, but they didn't have any other salsas. Also ordered \"crispy\" fingerling potatoes which were not crispy at all, but reasonably tasty with a nice sauce. Server disappeared again, had to get up and go to the hostess and ask her to have our server bring the bill.  We will never go back.",

From the excellent coffee to the creative food to the delicious bakery to the cute decor, I love it all. The food is new american with an emphasis on fresh ingredients and local foodstuffs. Lunch and brunch are the main meals, and everything I have tried has been wonderful. My husband loves the rosemary steak sandwich and I love the corn and goat cheese flat bread. We both enjoy the sweet potato chips with curry and the chicken chili. And, no herb box trip is complete w/o a trip to the bakery, where the raspberry crumble bars are outstanding. The caramel apple bars are also wonderful and hit just the right tart-salty-sweet note.",

Downtown area is cute and the restaurant was easy to find on the second floor. I was starving after a long morning traveling and met a few friends at the front door. We walked in, received glances from three different servers, and yet after 7 minutes we still stood there unattended. One more time a waiter walked right past us and without an invite to sit down, we promptly walked out. What's good food without service?   Justin and Adam from the Marketplace, on the first floor, were the two star saving grace. Forget the dine-in experience and just stop in and order from the Marketplace. Service there is sure to be great and the options are just the same with some extra benefits. Perfect stop for lunch or brunch too.",

    "text": "Being unfamiliar with Scottsdale in general, I wasn't sure what to expect when staying in Old Town for work. It was with much delight that I realized my proximity to so many great restaurants.   Take the Herb Box for example: large, open patio with plentiful seating for groups or just two, Christmas lights adorning the space, and the feeling that you are not in the middle of the desert. It being a Monday night, I was able to stay here sipping a notably refreshing cucumber and basil mojito for an extensive period of time whilst relishing the atmosphere. Service was somewhat attentive but they seemed to adapt to the type of evening you were desiring be it a large group with multiple requests or a low key night out.   I tried the vegan nosh board. Yum. It includes shishito peppers, a quinoa spring roll, jalapeno edamame hummus with an edamame salad, and corn and kale pakoras. It was an innovative medley of cuisines and flavors and I truly enjoyed each part. The edamame salad was more mainstream but still spicy and with great texture from the pairing of creamy hummus and roasted corn. The spring roll filled with black quinoa and mango was an ideal vehicle for the accompanying dip, which had hints of nuttiness, perhaps peanut sauce based. The pakoras were crispy and light but all were secondary to the shishito peppers. I'm loving shishito pepper season and these were blistered to perfection with a sweet tamari glaze proving a balance of spicy and sweet. I highly recommend trying the nosh board as you have an array of tastes and spices for a decent price. Overall, a relaxing evening in Scottsdale.",

It had far fewer vegetarian/pescetarian options than I expected, but still plenty of tasty choices.  Everything is delicious, and the trendy atmosphere, friendly waitstaff and beautiful patio round out an excellent experience.    I love the Portobello Manchego burger - it's postively bursting with flavor and comes with a giant side of humus.  We've also had the sweet potato tacos (delicious! but a smallish portion size for the price and lack of meat/fish).  The mac and cheese is really lovely and gourmet, and fingerling potato salad is delicious (although, don't expect a \"salad\" - see photo).  Our vegan friend has thoroughly enjoyed the nosh board (note:the pitas at HB aren't vegan and they don't come with the nosh board, but if you're vegan, you can't order some on the side).    I haven't tried the enchiladas and the salmon dish looks fancy (but has a fancy price to match), so there are only a few things that I can order.  As a result, I can't come here very often for dinner.  Looking forward to trying brunch sometime soon.  PS The ladies restroom is worth a visit!",

My friend had been there before and was happy to be back.. Apparently she doesn't make it to this area often enough, and it was my first time.  I absolutely love the decor!  It was like a little farmhouse and very shabby chic.  We were seated in the corner at a small table, which was fine.    I am not usually in to healthy breakfast options, and that is pretty much what is offered here.  However, I made do with the steak and eggs, which were delicious.  My friend had the salmon hash and loved it.  My only criticism is that the potatoes were not my favorite.  I would prefer regular hash browns or home fries.  The bloody mary was only meh.  It really didn't have any flavor, although I ordered it spicy.  It pretty much just tasted like watered down tomato juice, and it look at least 15 minutes to get.  Our server was very nice, and seemed to be training a newbie, but they were pretty slow.  Our food came out without a long delay though, so whatever.  I would definitely go back again, since it's a really cute little place and the food was pretty delicious.  It was fairly busy the day we went, so maybe on a slower day would be best.",

We were originally going to go to Classic Cakes but they were temporarily closed for twenty minutes and we didn't want to wait around. Honestly, we regret we didn't because the dessert selection at The Herb Box just didn't look as appetizing as the lemon bars over at Classic Cakes.  We decided to get a whole bunch of stuff--Red Velvet something, Pink Champagne Cake, Blackberry Pie, and what they called \"Crack Pie.\" The guy who was working there said that it was pretty equivalent to what a \"Sugar Pie\" was down in the south. I'm an original New Yorker, so I had no idea what that meant. He mentioned Pecans so I guess there's that. My fiance also picked up a Blackberry Italian Soda.   Nothing was particularly memorable nor delicious. It seems that I'm the outlier for this place, but it looks like all the good reviews are based off the actual food here, not the desserts. The Blackberry Italian Soda was decently made, but wasn't really that satisfying. The crack pie did indeed have a pecan-y taste to it, but again, it was just really overpoweringly sweet. Crust was A-OK at best. Honestly, the champagne cake was the most disappointing. I thought champagne cakes were supposed to be super airy; am I wrong? Both the cake and icing were quite dense and again, very sweet.   Their saving grace was the guy who was working there. He was very patient with us as we ordered pretty much one of everything and got it all to-go. He was also very helpful in general.  tl;dr really just meh, at least when it comes to desserts. Blackberry Italian Soda was decent. Champagne cake was highly disappointing.",

The slaw on the side was so sour,  that I took one bite and couldn't eat any more.  They over cooked my husband's burger. My stepson's mac and cheese looked pretty good though. Our six year old daughter got a cheese quesadilla and it was still $8 and we found out the pricey kids meals didn't even come with a drink when we got the bill. $11.50 for a kids meal.

We waited 10-15 minutes for drinks- having to flag a waiter down.... but the food was really good. The \"avocado love\" was unlike what you would expect- more chunks than smears of avocado but was fresh and good. All in all for a Wednesday night that wasn't busy? I expected more from the service- hence why only 3 stars. I'd like to try the D.C. ranch location.",

Let's start with the good: the brussel sprouts on the veggie nosh platter were delicious - crunchy, flavorful and light.   At least five of us ordered the glazed salmon for our entrees, and it was incredibly disappointing. We were told that it would be cooked medium - it was incredibly well done. One of my colleagues sent it back and was given another salmon - equally well done. It was bland and, frankly, something that I could have whipped together in my home for $5 and not a lot of effort.",

    "text": "Over the course of the last year we've been here 3 times and each time I lower the rating. Today we came in for lunch and they were super busy but we only waited ~20 minutes. However when got to our table the restaurant was empty inside, literally 3 tables. But I understand it's nice out and people were waiting for the patio... but that doesn't explain why we waited to be seated in an empty restaurant. Then they stuck us in a back corner behind a huge post. Again not a big deal just odd. So we ordered and the appetizer came out but we did have silverware, then our lunch came out just a few minutes later which felt very rushed for an empty restaurant. All that is fine if the food and service are good, but that wasn't the case today. The squash enchiladas were on point but the sweet potato tacos were rushed together and didn't taste like the ingredients belonged together. But the worst part was that we were kind of ignored, which gave me ample time to really look around the restaurant and it's filthy!!!! The chairs, the walls, the ceiling, and to top it off my wine glass had lipstick on it! This is likely our last visit.  I just left from our 2nd visit here and am sad to lower this review to 4 stars but for the 2nd time the bar drinks took forever! Today we finished our appetizer before they came out and the restaurant wasn't busy. The bar staff was standing around and our server had to ask them twice to make our drinks. Then our drinks sat at the bar for more than 5 minutes while several staff looked at them and walked away. There's really no reason that staff shouldn't help out and deliver each other's drinks. But the food was off the charts good again! Today we had brunch and the pancakes and breakfast tacos were both really great!  We did our early Christmas family dinner here and it was on point. Our server was also the bartender and somehow despite being busy behind the bar he gave us great service. We started with melon mule cocktails, Brussels sprout chips, and veggie pakora! All of them we awesome! For entrees we had the trout, risotto, and butternut squash enchiladas. I had the risotto without the pancetta and could tell it was missing something but I don't eat pork. My hubs had the enchiladas and they were great! My in-laws had the trout and ate every last bite, which is unusual for them. For dessert we split the bread pudding and it was meh... Overall this place has a great atmosphere, fun list of cocktails, vegan and meat eater friendly menu. Give it a go! We'll be back for sure.",

I'd give it a 3.5, but rounded up to 4.  I like their lunch menu better than brunch, but unfortunately they don't serve the lunch menu on the weekends. My favorite thing on the menu is the sugar charred salmon. Portion is reasonable, but not huge.   I also get the avocado toast here and have a weird gripe. It seems like half the time it comes with eggs on top and half the time it doesn't. It's weird because it never says there are eggs on it, but a couple times it came out with eggs on top. It is not as good with eggs. /endrant  All in all, I like this place for lunch if you're in the area.",

My Fiancee and I were waiting on a table at the Breakfast Club for over 40 minutes (noticed that the hostess was seating people who obviously checked in after us or was on her VIP list.) Will not be going back there again after finding this place.  The Herb Box is by far one of the best hidden spots in Old Towne Scottsdale, our server (Meghan) was on point with this being our firt time here, her suggestions and attention to details for our every need was exceptionally on point.  The menu has a wide array of options and we'll have to come back again to try new things.  It's away from the hustle of the common places in Old Towne and well worth giving it a shot.  I am very impress with the service and brunch menu.  When in doubt ans you want a change from trendy (you have to know someonebtobget a seat) places set out your box abd give The Herb Box a try, trust me you won't be disappointed.  We will be returning and suggesting this place to everyone.",

    "text": "So I am writing this several days after we are here because if I had the day of there would be no room for a positive review.  I have been here 5-6 times and we have loved it each time.  Service, food, ambiance etc....  This weekend was different, had reservations table wasn't ready, not too big of a deal really.  Sat down got waited on relatively fast and frankly that's fine was with my family and enjoying the time.  The 40 min passed and I noticed people that ordered after us had their food.  Now that again sometimes isn't a big deal.   But when we asked here was the response; \"well they had reservations and their food was cold so I put their order in first.\"  (Wait what? We had reservations.  Cold food is faster so why would you enter that first?).  Another issue is it wasn't True, one of the people eating had eggs and bacon!  It took almost 10 Min for her to come by and tell us that.  At that same time she said; the manager is taking care of it.  I have no idea what that meant but it was another 10 min before we got the food.   So with that the food came out and the manager said nothing other than asked what I was drinking.  Told him and never saw the drink, totally ignored.  So now the food, kids were done they liked it.  My wife and I had the same thing, it was mediocre at best.  I would never order it again.  Ok so why did this happen?  Well I have a couple Of theories; I think they were short staffed from a waiter standpoint, I think the waiter we had doesn't know how to take responsibility and lastly EVERYTIME we have been in we didn't have kids with us! Scottsdale and kids are along and we get crap service and not great food.  Not the first time.",

    "text": "We moved here in 2000 and shortly after stumbled on The Herb Box in Aqua Caliente on Shea Boulevard in Scottsdale. Well, we loved it, and became \"regulars.\" We found the place appealing, the food was good and always consistent.   I may not have the sequence right but, at some point, they closed this location and opened the absolutely stunning location on Stetson. It truly was a destination. Had many lunches there with tennis friends and special occasion lunches with friends and family. It never disappointed. The last time we were there was about a year ago. We had taken a family member there who recently moved to Arizona and she loved it too.  On a whim, and because we hadn't been there for about a year, we decided to head into Old Town and have lunch at The Herb Box. Imagine our surprise when we found out it wasn't there anymore. Imagine our shock when we learned they had moved into the old 5th and Wine premises on 5th Ave. Well, location notwithstanding, we decided to give it a try.  What became apparent was that, despite the move, the food hadn't suffered. The Pakora was still the best dish on the menu as far as we are concerned, the white bean chicken chile soup was still to die for and our favorite wine, the Scarpetta Pinot Grigio, was on the menu. Not so fond of the pear and gorgonzola flatbread, especially the flatbread which was, well, flat. Unfortunately, the restaurant was completely lacking in any kind of ambience or atmosphere. We sat on their patio next to what appeared to be a vacant building next door that was being used for storage. To be honest, it felt more than just a bit shabby.   Sadly, this location is not one we would recommend. If we happened to be in that part of town, we would likely consider stopping in for a glass of Scarpetta and some Pakora, but, unlike their former location, it's not the sort of place we would choose to linger at.   I'm guessing the reason for the move was financial. The former location had to have been costing a small fortune. I'm further guessing they wanted to maintain a presence in Old Town, and this was a way to do it. Susan, I can imagine you saying, \"I can make this work.\" The only problem is I doubt it is working for those customers who patronized your Stetson location.   The Herb Box name has long been associated with an upmarket crowd. Your catering is fabulous. You catered a friend's wedding several years ago and it couldn't have been better. The decision to move into this space seems so out of character.  Again, I would like to emphasize that the food is of the same quality but, if I need my Herb Box \"fix\", I will get it at your DC location.  Finally, the hostess was less than welcoming.",

    "text": "I ate here for first time for free in a month I forgot, 2017, as incentive to hear a business talk about health management.  There were about 25 people in attendance, so we had several servers, who did a pretty good job.  I ordered the butternut squash and corn enchiladas.  It came with a mixed baby greens salad that did not have enough dressing on it.    Second time I ate here was at 5:30 May 22, 2018, is when a friend said Herb Box is going to move to another location where you cannot sit by the canal, and my friend wanted to experience sitting by the canal, one last time for happy hour.  I called about 2 hours earlier and made reservations for a table for 2 closest to the canal.  He got my name and said there was a large party, but they still had room for 2 people.  I don't know his name but when I arrived, my name was not on the list of reservations.  I think that guy got distracted and forgot to write our reservation down, but they still had a couple of tables for us to choose from.    My fnend who asked me to come to this, talked about how good the flatbread was.  So we ordered the corn and cheese flatbread topped with arugula for $5 HH price, to share.  When it arrived, my friend told me last time she was here ordering the same thing only 2 weeks ago, the toppings were much more generous.  She found the picture on her phone that she took, and yes, the toppings were piled much higher!  She was disappointed, so I said \"You can send it back!\"  She said \"I was thinking of that.\"  I said let's do it.  We asked a female server to get our server.  She asked if she could help us, so we told her about the skimpy flatbread, showed her the photo, and she offered to take it back and have them add more toppings.  When they brought it back, they piled it high with arugula, the cheese seemed to be the same, but we were much happier.  The flatbread overall was good, I'd give it 4 stars.  My friend also ordered  an alcoholic drink for $6.  Our server was Daniel E.  He came as soon we sat down and brought us the water we asked for.  He came many times to ask if we needed anything, while we were first eating.  But after a while it seemed like he was coming to interrupt our intense conversation every 5 minutes, asking if we needed anything!  It got downright annoying, because it always interrupted our conversation.  My friend did not like him one bit either, and said \"he doesn't seem to notice that we are engrossed in our conversation and he is interrupting us each time!\".  I got more and more resentful, and his repetitive interrupting with such short time periods between his visits, bordered on harrassment !  When me came to ask again, I very affirmatively told him \"We will come get you if we need anything\".  He said, \"I just want to give good service!\"    Well he STILL didn't get the hint.  He kept interrupting us even when we already paid our check.  I am a senior Foodie who eats out almost every day, and I cannot remember a server coming every 5 - 10 minutes to ask us if we needed anything in my entire long memory.  There comes a point where such repeated visits implies to ME that he wants us to leave, so the table could turn over more and he could make more tips.  Or since we ordered only 1 flatbread which we shared, and one drink, he wanted us to order MORE so he could get MORE tip.  There were still vacant tables beside us, so I told my friend it isn't as if there was a long line of people waiting for our table.  Our bill was only $11 plus tax.  My friend still left him a 15% tip, but my friend was not happy with his service for other reasons.    I guess being a server is hard, damnned if you don't make enough visits to a table to check on people, and damned if you make too many vists in the name of \"good service\".  But I really feel that the number of his visits in the 2 hours we were there for HH, is extreme, borderline harrassment and at the very least, \"lack of sense and respect of people's privacy\".  That is why I am giving 2 stars, not the skimpy flatbread and they forgot to write down our reservations. To ME, his profuse visits insinuated an ulterior motive than \"good service\".  Another eyebrow-raising experience in this visit, is when I called to make reservations, I asked why they had to move.  The employee said he did not know, only the owner knew.  I found it odd that the owner didn't tell the employees.  When I arrived, I asked the person who could not find my name on their reservation list, why they were moving.   He said he was not privy to that information, but maybe a manager would know.  I asked to speak to a manager.  When he came to our table, he said he didn't know either, he was \"only the manager, not the owner\".  I had already told my friend before the manager came, they probably are moving for an unpleasant reason, due to \"no one would say\".",

And after arriving, I couldn't have been happier. The restaurant, it self, is really well done.  It has a great atmosphere. Not too loud and not to quiet. It's great for 2 people or even a large group.  It's worth popping in for an app or a quick drink if you don't have time for dinner.   The atmosphere and food were both done extremely well. We will be coming back for sure. Everything on the menu is delicious.    But the highlight of the evening would have to be the service staff.  Everyone on on the floor was super attentive and helpful. Every server working was helpful in every way possible. And our server, Tanya, I believe that was her name, was the best ever!  She was friendly, outgoing, super fun and made the whole dining experience memorable. High five to the staff and to our server.",

Booked the reservation over a month ago and was told they were doing their regular menu, but was called a few weeks later to let me know it would be a buffet.  I said fine, and kept the reservation.  Little did I know this place is not conducive to a buffet.  It was not comfortable or easy to get to.  When a few people were in line, no one could get in the front door.  It was cramped into a little spot with some of the food being outside around the corner.  I would think some people wouldn't have even known there was any more food outside.   There was not a big selection and many of the items were dry and overcooked and the others were cold.  I usually like this place, but after this visit, I won't be rushing back.  We did love our waiter tho, and at least that part was pleasant.  I was surprised that it wasn't busy at all.  Many many empty tables.  I wish mine had been one of them.  :-) It gets 3 stars because we loved our waiter and it wasn't awful, just not up to par.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place.  The concept is wonderful, everything is farm fresh, organic, and/or vegetarian.  My mouth watered at the words on the menu.  But, alas, my love never came to be.  We started with the mezza platter, which is basically a board with two giant scoops of hummus and a few olives for pizazz.  They are crazy stingy with the pita bread.  They seriously give you enough hummus to feed a country, and then one slice of pita cut into four small triangles.  You are left with a gallon of hummus and nothing to eat it with.  The kicker is that they charge you 3 bucks to get another small dish of pita bread so you can continue to eat your bland hummus.  On the bright side, we found a weird plastic nozzle in the middle of our hummus, so that got comped.  (If you consider finding a weird plastic thing in your food a bright side, that is)  The Gouda mac n' cheese was OK.  The butternut squash enchiladas were... you guessed it... OK.  Neither were bad, but they weren't great either.  It didn't make much impact.    My stars are bumped up to three because the atmosphere is to die for.  We sat on the patio, surrounded by beautiful trees and herbs like rosemary and lavender wafting in the air.  We had a view of the canal and it was a beautiful day.  The lovely decor gives this place an edge, but the food itself was really just.... meh.",

    "text": "The Herb Box is a little hard to find for first timers, but worth your effort to get there.  You have to turn up a street that looks like you are going to a residential area before you get there and then it is tucked into a strip mall.  The Herb Box offers a wide range menu with a good selection of grab and go dinners/lunches in the cold case in the bar/pick up side of the restaurant.  They actually have two suites that are side by side that offer sit down and pickup.    If you are getting To Go or Pickup orders, they do a nice job of using good quality boxes that keep the food protected and warm.  They also will sell their salad dressings (vinagarette = yum) in nice glass take home bottles.   I highly recommend the Butternut Squash Enchiladas.  They are little more pricey than everything else on the menu and lack a True side, but they are very rich in flavor and have a very pleasant spicy taste that trailers the sweetness the butternut squash offers.  They are also cooked to perfection leaving the cheese nicely melted and crisping up the shell without it becoming soggy.  They offer a nice variety of salads and side options.  Another few notes, the mac n' cheese in the To Go case is a good reheat item to take home for a side or late night snack or powerful enough for a dinner.  The vinegarette  goes great with an orzo pasta and feta cheese.  The take home baked goods are very tasty.  Cozy little cafe style feel at The Herb Box and a simple menu with big flavor give this a 4 star rating!",

It took about 20 minutes to get the food, and then I was just about to cancel my order. However, the food came out and I was very impressed! I even got the food to go, which was a surprise because most places do not do this. The two dishes I was very impressed with was the Market Street Short Rib Tacos ($6.50) and sweet potato chips ($2). The Tzatziki + Hummus + Olives + PIta was OK. I'd probably pass on that the next time I come here. Overall, the place is very nice. Looks like you can come here for a birthday party or come on a date. It has a nice ambiance, which was surprising since the name of the place \"The Herb Box\" sounds like it has a casual setting. Good pick for lunch or happy hour!",

    "text": "There's a hair in my arugula. A long, straight hair. I know what you're thinking ... 'well, that's better than a short and curly hair.' Although True, I'm just not in need of the extra protein. Plenty of that provided by the grilled tenderloin sitting atop of said arugula and beside aforementioned hair.  I chose not to make a scene as the place - early afternoon on a Tuesday - was fairly full of fine female patrons. I removed the hair with surgical precision and proceeded to enjoy my lunch. And enjoy, I did.  I saw many many savory items on the menu, but I can only speak to the Arugula-Gorgonzola Steak. Tasty. Oh ... and the sweet potato chips were the truth as well. The place is kinda' unique in that it shares two different suites - a \"market\" on one side and an \"eatery\" on the other - joined by a breezeway in the middle. One could enjoy their meal, or a glass of wine outside if one so desired.   Four stars. I'm not deducting anything for the hair, but the 'Box is awfully proud of their prices and the service leaves much to be desired. I mean, the gal that occasionally tended to me was friendly ... just not necessarily well-versed in the art of prompt, accommodation of customer requests. Like the one I made for silverware and a napkin. Twice.   That said, the Herb Box was a cute little joint and I'm sure I'll be stopping in again for lunch when I find myself hocking fenestrations mid-day in north Scottsdale.   Next time I'll try a twelve-dollar sandwich. Brown Sugar Pork Ciabatta. Sans follicle, if I may.",

    "text": "A third day, a third bakery, but this time the goods actually made it back to the hotel and served as breakfast on the day of my departure...well, okay, I had to try a bite of each while they were fresh but I promise the rest made it through both refrigeration and rewarming without further consumption until the next day.  For my third and last pastry stop on this tour of the Valley I just so happened to be wandering the Scottsdale Fashion Square before lunch at Cowboy Ciao and opted to stop into The Herb Box based on the recommendation of a friend.  First approaching the upstairs restaurant, at this point thriving with Saturday brunchers, the space is admittedly gorgeous looking out on the river and after browsing the menu (note to self, red velvet pancakes and a divine sounding BLT with ricotta) I subsequently made my way down to the basement bakery, cafe, coffee shop, and wine store.  Greeted on entering by a young lady behind the counter who asked if she could get a beverage ready for me while I waited I agreed to a large iced coffee while I weighed my options; a bevy  of muffins, scones, pastries, and desserts totaling at least forty - some standard and some entirely unique but all but a few desirable.  Deciding once again to choose one for myself and to rely on my server for the second choice my options were boxed, then bagged, and paying the $13 tab with tax and tip I made my way back to the street.  Beginning first with my selection, a tossup between the Red Velvet Cake and Bread Pudding, the pudding always wins and in this case my selection of Vanilla Bean Bread Pudding with Peach and Peaches n' Cream Glaze would prove to be the best bread pudding of the trip not only in its present cool state, but even more so the following day after reheating.  Dense and packed with notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and most of all vanilla juxtaposing studs of sliced peaches this \"pudding\" was nearly cakelike in its texture and when topped with the glaze - a dense anglaise with more cinnamon and the fructose sweetness of peaches serving as top notes - it was simply outstanding.  Moving next to my server's suggestion, another dish billed as \"best thing ever,\" this is one circumstance where I can actually say that at that very moment I felt like she may have been right because as good as my Bread Pudding had been, the adult Ding Dong was all the better.  Beginning first with a dense chocolate cake made with dark Dutch processed cocoa, the base of this dessert was clearly sour cream based and all the better for it as the slight flavors melded perfectly.  Moving next to the \"cream filling\" in this case replaced with a nearly liquid white chocolate marshmallow cream the sweetness was a perfect balance to the cake while the entirety of the dessert was encased in a dense dark chocolate shell flecked with blue edible glitter.  A masterpiece both visually, texturally, and in terms of flavor I'd not hesitate to call this one of the best \"upscale\" takes on American Retail comfort food I've ever had (notwithstanding Cathal Armstrong's Foie Gras Twinkie, of course.)  Doing my best to restrain myself from eating the entirety of both before the following day while carrying the bag from store to store in order to prevent melting in the hot Arizona Sun all I know now is that my next visit to Phoenix/Scottsdale will see me with breakfast or brunch at The Herb Box and desserts from the cafe below (that may or may not make it out the door, but certainly not to the following day.)",

I knew it was going to be good - when we pulled up and saw the Herb Box vehicle, all my friends in the car started oohing and ahhing about the food we were about to eat.   The food was displayed so beautifully - it looked like a feast for kings and queens. So so pretty!  There were two different kinds of wraps, plantain chips w/ this amazing creamy crab dip, the most wonderful sundried tomato spread on crispy crostinis, and yummy mixed green salad. Everything tasted amazing. I am not a fan of sundried tomatoes, but that spread was so good - I wish I had the recipe!  If I ever need catering, I will definitely use this company!",

    "text": "I am writing this review based on my recent experiences in the new Herb Box location in DC Ranch.  I've been to the original location, too, but have been to the one on Market Street much more.  This place is so stylish and swanky that you just enjoy being there and looking around.  The menu is varied and interesting so you can go many times and have totally different culinary experiences each time.  I love this because it is right in my neighborhood and it is a much needed place to meet friends for lunch.    Fortunately there are lots of other businesses and offices nearby so you can also get some free wifi while you eat if you have your laptop with you.  A few cautions, though...  1.  While everyone who works there is friendly and upbeat, very few of the servers actually know what they're doing.  You WILL have to remind them to fill your glass, take away your dirty plate and occasionally to bring you the food you ordered.    2.  No one who works behind the market counter knows how to work the register...but they're commentary as they try to figure it out is entertaining.  3..The gift-y items in the market are adorable and disgustingly overpriced.    Even though I've been a little caustic about the things I don't like, I will say that they really have it nailed in terms of serving up a delicious meal whether you're looking for breakfast, lunch, dinner or a snack.  Their ingredients are fresh, the portions are good and the creativity of the recipes is delightful.  One last little thing, though...cilantro is spelled wrong on the lunch menu (it is correct on the dinner one, though).  Sorry, but spelling DOES count.",

It's is a very Scottsdale locale so I do somewhat worry that my eyebrows are not waxed enough or my nose straight enough to lounge in the patio by the canal. But, the drinks are good, the service is lovely, and beyond the weird shrimp toast, the food is great!",

It's a must.  On my last dinner visit, my waiter sold me on the Thai BBQ Baby Back Ribs, which come with a green apple slaw, jicama & watercress, and smoked gouda mac-n-cheese. Yum.The green apple slaw was the perfect contrast to the rich mac-n-cheese, and the ribs were ridiculously tender.   For lunch my go-to has been the Urban Market Steak Salad (grilled beef tenderloin, ancho-bourbon demi, watercress, avocado, sweet red pepper, bacon, sugared pecan, sweet dried corn, gorgonzola), but my co-worker had the Chicken-Avocado Chop Salad and said it was the best salad he'd ever had. Really. Direct quote: \"This is the best salad I've ever had.\" So, I might need to try that next time.",

    "text": "I tried Herb Box for lunch with a coworker today, and while it was a little pricey, I enjoyed the meal. The setting on the canal is beautiful, and on a perfect, 80-degree day like today, the outdoor setting was just right! Music was mellow, and if we hadn't had to come back to work, we could have killed hours drinking wine and hanging out.   I had the Sunflower Salad, which came with Cajun chicken, goat cheese, dried blueberries and strawberries, bacon and (of course) sunflower seeds! It was tossed with a light vinaigrette, and very tasty! My only complaint was that the chicken was in four large chunks, which I had a hard time cutting up because the bowls are a bit slanted, and it's hard to cut on greens. My coworker's was nicely cubed, though, so I'm guessing that's how it usually comes. Nothing that couldn't be solved with a small side plate!   The waiter was very kind, and with tip, I think the meal was about $20. (Pretty steep for a lunch salad in my opinion, and I only drank tap water.)  The verdict: Decent place for lunch, but maybe not very frequently... I'd probably be just as happy paying $15 at chop shop and getting a side of Sweet Potato Hash with that price!",

The downstair area does not have the full menu, but is designed to get a quick take out bite.  There is a nice little patio (complete with comfy chairs and misters), which is perfect for lunch when weather is good.  No matter where you dine--the food is healthy and tasty, plus moderately priced. Check out their Jasmine Green Tea for something refreshing--it is perfect sipping for a hot summer day. The dessert menu is extra tempting, but I have viciously beat back my sugar cravings and declined to give them a try.  If I ever order a dessert, I will revise this review and add my thoughts.    Parking is meh. It's old town Scottsdale, so good luck there. But if you find a spot, this place is near the canal and there is nice walking to be had after eating.",

Even if you're indoors, it seems they like to open the place up, and the sounds of shoppers and birds outside really add to the experience. The prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the food, which is excellent, and they come up with some fairly unique offerings for brunch, but also offer traditional options if you're just in the mood for eggs and bacon.  Regardless, if you're in town visiting, want to take the family out for a meal, are having a lazy day, or want to take your special lady somewhere classy and fun, this fits the bill for everything.",

Originally I was going to go for the Cubano but when I realized I could still get breakfast...I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get the salmon hash.  The hubby got the brioche peach french toast which he devoured AND THEN we also split the red velvet pancakes.    The hash was soooo good. Best thing I've had thus far in Scottsdale.  It's smoked salmon, crispy fingerling potatoes,  scallions, and fried capers (which I skipped) and topped with an egg (I got mine over easy). It also came with a red pepper aioli which set the dish off just right.  The red velvet pancakes,  mmm. I could eat those all over again. Not too heavy,  didn't taste artificial (like food coloring if that makes sense), and really just overall well prepared and was just the right amount of sweetness to compliment my hash.   Service was great,  the atmosphere was awesome,  and prices reasonable.  I really have no complaints and will probably visit again before my trip is over.  There is outdoor seating available but even indoors is light,  bright,  and open.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting.",

It may have been an off night for him, but we have had similarly slow dinner experiences here and I don't think the food justifies such a long wait.  As for the food, the edamame hummus and Korean fried cauliflower are pretty good. We also liked the short rib enchiladas, but probably would not get the trout again.  It was also odd to me that while they have vegetarian and gluten free options, salad was pretty much the only vegan AND gluten free entree type option on the dinner menu one night, which made it tough for one person in the party - just something to be aware of if you have multiple dietary restrictions.",

The Brussel Sprout \"chips\" weren't crispy, but doesn't matter - flavor was on point. The vegan aioli was a nice surprise at the bottom of the plate. (Not a surprise if you read the description on the menu, but I obviously didn't.)  I had a hard time deciding on my entree as so many of the items seemed interesting. I was torn between a salad or a bowl - went with the sweet potato baja bowl and have no regrets. The combination of textures and flavors was perfect...and I'm not even a fan of black beans.  So, that says something.  I really don't think you can go wrong with anything here.  But, I've only been here once and live 600 miles away, so it may be awhile before I find out which menu items to stay away from.  Herb Box, please open in LA!!!",

My husband had the blackened steak. The steak was very tender and flavorful. The blistered shishito peppers that came with it were great! Drinks were also great, I had the blackberry mojito and my husband got the Martinez. Both were great! To finish we shared the vegan pot de creme. If I didn't know it was vegan, I would not have been able to tell. It was very rich and delicious. The shortbread cookies that came with it were great but the rosemary was too much for us. The service was great! Our server, Sasha, was awesome! She provided many recommendations and was very friendly. The manager even stopped by to make sure everything was great...it was!",

Service was good (and some of the cocktails) which is why I gave two stars. The food was boarder line inedible. Mac and cheese sides were ice cold, ribs were tough. Baha shrimp was far too spicy for very spice tolerant people, my lentil meatballs tasted like an entire salt shaker dumped on it -- and I love salt! The butternut squash enchiladas were blah...and those used to be my favorite. It seemed as though the kitchen is taste deficient, because nothing tasted right.  The only ok part of the meal was the Korean cauliflower and the Brussels sprout chips.   I sadly won't be back...looking for a new Scottsdale staple in the area.",

I ended up having the short rib enchiladas. They were yummy. And the slaw it came with added a nice crunch. Since we had time to kill I went for dessert and got the special - a lemon chiffon pie. Nice, lemony taste and a delicious crust, but the texture was a little gelatinous. Winner for dessert at my table was the salted butterscotch creme brulee. Overall a great looking restaurant with yummy food and good service. I'd go back, but just remember to make a reservation!",

I was disappointed.  There was a grand total of ONE vegan entree on the menu, which was good but pricey and overall disappointing for a restaurant that seems to claim it has good vegan options.  At the time I dined there, there was no vegan dessert option and all of my friends got dessert while I sat and watched them.  It seems they have added a vegan option since that time, so that's some progress, I guess.  I will not consider going back there unless the vegan options are better.",

    "text": "I love the private room and I loved the food here. My only detractor was the server. We had a server named Ricardo for a work happy hour in the private room and were told by a team member at work to order a entree with a salad and have a drink on our company in order to hit a minimum and reserve the room. The server eagerly corrected our team member and let us know that we just needed to spend a minimum of $500 to have the private room. While I was a little thrown off with how he debated with my coworker about the terms of the contract that I was certain she read carefully, I still found him thoughtful and was glad he was correcting and informing us about the terms of the room. This even allowed for us to order apps! I later watched as he corrected everyone whenever there was a mistaken appetizer or meals switched between seat numbers and noticed that instead of owning the little things that were honest mix ups and didn't matter too much, he framed it in a way as if we misordered. None of this mattered at all at first. Toward the end of the meal, my coworker ordered a Manhattan (on the menu) only to be told that guests usually don't order that menu item and given a hard time. After spending over the 500 dollar minimum to book the room until 6:30 PM, the server came in several times after 6 PM, seemingly very annoyed and asking if we wanted to leave and check out the Karaoke at places nearby (also keep in mind that the restaurant appeared to be pretty slow at the time). A lot of us have been in the industry and tend to forgive easily but I felt the need to post my feedback of this service.",

I've been meaning to try this location every time I'm in Scottsdale but I kept putting it off since we would find other Dining spots more to our liking, or so we thought. The Herb Box is located in Old Town but is anything but old. It's corner location which includes a market, wrap around patio seating and live music ( music was on a Friday not sure if it's avail daily) is a modern and welcoming spot great for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner.  We chose to dine inside where the AC kept us comfortably cool. The blackberry jasmine tea was so refreshing and my new favorite! We shared the spicy Thai ribs, few appetizers, and moved on to sangria and wine. There was no rush on our part or our friendly server's ... Much appreciated.  The menu is not overwhelming, just enough options to satisfy the pickiest of eaters. Vegans, vegetarians and Carnivores alike.   The Herb Box is truly a 4 star \"better than most\" dining spots in Scottsdale and we have added this restaurant to our list of favs.",

Rico, B's husband has moved from Z Tejas to the Herb Box so I got to tag along to the \"practice night\", I'm sure there's technical term for if for those in the business but for me it meant free dinner at one of my favorite places.   First, the decor. You can't work in interior design for six years and not notice design. They've done it up in a cozy Cape Cod feel with exposed beams, wide plank floors, lots of blue and sea colors. Not so much you feel like you're in a sea food restaurant, but in a chic way. It has a little bit of a contemporary feel and the bathrooms are very cool. Check out the sinks. Go on. You need to go just for that.   B and I got there first, another friend was meeting us but was running a little late so we started with the cilantro crab dip, one of my favorites. There are nice, big chunks of crab in it and the plantain chips it comes with are thin, crisp and salty. For the main course B decided on the goat cheese chicken and enjoyed it. Our other friend got her old standby the Market Sunflower Salad and added salmon. I debated between the trout and the short ribs and ultimately decided on the short ribs but think next time I'll go with the trout. I have to say the short ribs were the second best I've had, in line right behind Chelsea's Kitchens. For dessert our waiter brought us a slice of the stout cake with espresso frosting, pure heaven, and a piece of the blackberry bread pudding. The bread pudding was more like a steamed dumpling and was lacking in flavor though the creme anglais it came with was creamy and unctuous. The espresso frosting on the cake reminded me of penuche candy.  I wasn't too excited to get a piece of cake but it really was a nice treat.  I just ate the frosting off the back I was so full by this time.   The Herb Box also has a beautiful patio with big windows opening to the bar and comfortable, intimate fireplaces. This is such a convenient location right in old town and steps away from the mall, I know it will become a regular place for me.",

The second time the board looked sloppily put together, some of the hummus was overly acidic and the hummus was less creamy (making it appear that it was prepared in haste).

When I got there, they took my name and the host said 10 minutes. I came back 15 minutes later, and the same host said another 10 minutes. I came back 10 minutes later and a hostess said I still had 2 names ahead of mine and she apologizes \"we are waiting for the servers to catch up\"  I looked inside and there were plenty of seats. I said \"why not bring people off the curb and offer them drinks at least.\" To which she replied \"sorry, just what my manager said\"  So I called Citizen Public House and they prepared a table for me on the spot. (IT WAS MONDAY) I won't be trying again. Figured I would mention it, as it could have been easily correctable: \"hey can we get you a drink at the bar while you wait\" or \"Hey my apologies, we are very understaffed, can we seat you and offer you a beverage\"",

It was about 7:30 on a Saturday but they sat us right away. Off the bat it seemed like we were in for a great night, but once seated the night took a turn.  First, we waited for at least 15 minutes for our waiter to even come over and take our drink order. It was clear he was overwhelmed because he asked to take our drink and food order at the same time. Not my favorite way to start what is suppose to be a romantic dinner. It took another 10 or 15 minutes to get the drinks we ordered and then we didn't see our sever again until half an hour after that when we got our food. It seemed like an exceptionally long wait to not be offered another drink. The my food was delicious, I had the enchiladas the large salad that came on the side was a great compliment. My husband had the ribeye, he ordered it medium rare and it came out pretty much bloody, it took the waiter about 10 minutes to come back and check in us, at that point my husband sent the steak back in to the grill. The server was really kind about this but then brought the steak back without a fork to eat it with, having learned by this point, I asked for a fork before he left our table and it still took 5 minutes to get it.  Toward the end of the night our server chatted us up about beer and pot and chochella. We were down to talk, but him steering the convo toward pot because we are from CO was slightly unprofessional.  Overall it seems like this place could be great if they polished the customer service and the attention to detail. I get that you are busy but as a customer I never want to feel your stress.",

And the bacon it came with was delish as well.  All of their other dishes sounded amazing too, so I will be back to try more soon!  The only downside was the server.  He was a bit rude but maybe it was just a rough day for him.",

    "text": "Friday March 10th 7:30-8:45pm -HORRIBLE experience!! Waited a full 25 minutes after being seated - finally got the attention of hostess who was embarrassed and got the Bartender to wait on me. He was great and very nice - HOWEVER - 25 minutes later still no appetizer. I had only ordered a Chili, With entree to follow. The Bartender was savvy enough to see my agitation about 20 minutes in and sent me a drink on the house - saying he spoke to the kitchen and my soup would be right out. After 12 more minutes I gave up and left. I spent over an hour at that table and never had a bite of food.  I spoke to the manager (Rhonda I believe ) who said they had a large party and sorry. That moment was the first I had seen her the hour I was there. This place doesn't care about hospitality. Not one waiter made eye contact as I sat there those first 25 minutes. I NEVER saw anyone in charge as far as a supervisor or manager goes. No one checking the room, the outdoor area or bar area. Just waiters walking around in a robotic deer in the headlights look - clearly short staffed. It all starts from the top!!! If management is bad, then wait staff will follow their leader. This was my last night in Phoenix and I was so looking forward to a nice dinner out. What a total disappointment. Full disclosure- I've been in Hospitality business for 35 years.",

    "text": "I have to say after seeing all these positive reviews it makes me even more disappointed that I had just an unpleasant experience.   My friends and I came here yesterday to grab a quick bite to eat and a few drinks.  We came around 3 or 4 in the afternoon so it was very quite.  It was our first time so when we walked in we were not sure if it was open seating or what so after being ignored for a few minutes we just decided to have a seat.  When we sat down again no one came to greet us or give us menus so we politely asked what appeared to be a host for some menus.  This woman was soo rude, she didn't even say one word to us all she did was glare back (how dare we bother her for a menu, the nerve!) until another employee offered to get us some menus and waters.  After that my friends and I were already feeling very unwelcomed but still took a look at the menu.  Again the same woman walked by our table looked directly at us, rolled her eyes, shook her head and then darted into some back room. (SERIOUSLY! is that a joke?!)  Now at this point I was so upset and our server also  hadn't been back to check on us after several minutes( I'm not exaggerating, there was one othe so we just got up and left all together.    I can honestly say they have lost my business forever and I will NEVER recommend this place to any of my friends or family.   Super disappointing.  What ever happened to good customer service??",

We were there celebrating my sister's 40th birthday party and twelve women were out in honor of their friend. We assumed it was normal that they let us get settled without taking drink orders, but it was quite awhile until someone came over. We ordered our drinks and got them about 15-20 minutes later (not sure how long it takes to make a diet coke, but ok). When we asked the manager where our server was to take our order, he said that we were busy \"gossiping\" and that's why our order wasn't taken. This was the manager, Paul. Gossiping? Seriously? We are a group of 40 and older women, please calm down Paul. If you'd like us to gossip, I'm sure we can gossip about our bad service from this restaurant. We arrived at 10am, got drinks by 10:45am and by 11:30 we were still waiting for food. I had to go up to the bar twice to get a refill of soda and they screwed up one order of food and completely FORGOT another person's order. It's 12 people, I used to work in a restaurant. There were hardly any other patrons and they staff was too busy giving each other massages at the hostess stand to worry about tending to their customers. We spent $20 a meal plus drinks and a $70 cake, I expect far better service. I will tell everyone I know to skip this place and head to a restaurant that is more worried about tending to it's paying customers than trying to act as if they are too cool to care.",

The bartender was trying to get us to stay but after one look at the menu we promised we would be back the next weekend!  I think I have found my new favorite brunch location.  Their Sunday Brunch special is the best in town.  An entree, a little crustini, and all the bloody marys/mimosas you can drink....great deal!!!  RED VELVET PANCAKES....Amazing!  These were the best pancakes I've had in a long time.  These cakes are topped with marscarpone creme and a side of bacon is a great breakfast combo!  A friend tried the Chilequiles.  This is the prefect combination of shredded pork, eggs, and chili....yum!  The Breakfast Steak and Eggs were another great treat.  The fingerling potatoes were a great side.    I highly recommend a Sunday stop at the Herb Box.  Its a great local place on the Waterfront and be a great place for Sunday Funday!",

I'll start with the pros: comfortable atmosphere, cute decor reminiscent of summertime in a lovely cottage near the seashore (this is MY opinion), prompt service, extensive menu of options..  I just thought the food was eh. Went here for breakfast on a rainy Saturday and ordered the simple good morning eggs. Although, from the title, I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into. However, the eggs came out cold and the cheese hardly melted on top. I could have sent it back but I hate being one of those people so I trudged though it. I was looking forward to a hearty meal but was left unsatisfied and still hungry. I don't expect to have to eat the toast to fill me up. If that were the case, I should have stayed home. One caveat, I also don't eat bacon. The coffee was nothing to write home about either.   My boyfriend ordered the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes, which he enjoyed and was more than a decent portion size.   I would return possibly for lunch or dinner and give this place another chance. The other menu options look awesome and if the taste follows suite, I will re-review. The market downstairs also looked really cute with to-go meals or quick bite on the run. I'll be back!",

The food was even mostly impressive (two out of our four meals were stellar; one was awful; the other was passable).  There are so few inventive, original restaurants with vegetarian/vegan options, so please fix your problems and thrive!  The service was absolutely lousy.  I think we got the same male waiter listed by another reviewer.  He would disappear for 15 minute blocks of time.  It took him multiple promptings to refill a wine glass (this is a huge missed revenue opportunity for both the server and restaurant).  I'm sure it was not all his fault.  The food took forever to come out and there where few people in the restaurant.  I wonder if the kitchen was struggling.  It took 20 minutes for a cheese plate!    The owner came out at one point but didn't seem to notice or care that one of us had not touched his \"medium\" burger that was raw.  She didn't ask if everything was okay or question the uneaten food.  Good restaurants notice these things and ask why.  Otherwise you can guarantee you've got a table that will not return.    I will come back and try again.  I hope these problems are resolved and I can simply enjoy what should be an exemplary restaurant.",

Our friend from the midwest loved the short rib. I love how the app's all came with a little something healthy like fresh greens and/or couscous. They don't skimp on the healthy stuff which I so appreciate. We split a couple entrees among the three of us. Both were good, again with lots of healthy accompaniments. My favorite was the salmon (sustainable!). --We always say, a restaurant is only as good as it's waitstaff and bartender, and I can't say enough good things about them. They took great care of us. Sasha and Carlos were awesome! They worked around us beautifully and were careful not to interrupt as we caught up with our out of town guest. Thank you Sasha and Carlos!

    "text": "To say that I WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO \"The Herb Box\" is an understatement. Read on for details of my ZERO STAR Review. (1 star = ZERO) This was one of my favorite places in Scottsdale. But NO LONGER! I discovered it in 2012, when a close friend recommended it. At that time the menu was eclectic, creative & delicious. Yesterday I decided, after 3 notably BAD experiences, I would GIVE THEM ONE LAST TRY before abandoning all hope.  I am to the point of wondering if the management or chef has changed from the great experiences I once knew. I have noticed the menu does not change seasonally as it used to.  There is no longer seasonal variety. Last time, I ordered the Leek Gratin, which looked interesting but proved to be so chewy & undercooked that I couldn't choke it down. It didn't help that it sat unappetizingly puddled in slimy cheese & translucent ooze. It was the farthest thing from what a gratin should have been. On that day, I also ordered the Market Salad to-go, explaining to the server that I needed a dinner (6 hours later). I mistakenly didn't check it to see that it had already been drenched in dressing (it should've been on the side) and would not be edible by the time I found it later that evening in a wilted pile of sludge). It was the lemon tart that brought me back for one last try.  I met my friend, (who has some disability due to a stroke and an aneurysm) at the entrance, & when we walked into the restaurant through the back door, where the handicapped service elevator lets out, we stood there for a few minutes with no attention, so we began to walk towards a booth. The manager quickly ran over to deflect us, saying he had to check to make sure the booth wasn't reserved. My friend can't stand for long periods of time, so she kept pointing to various booths asking if we could sit \"there?\"...what about there?...or there?\", while the manager kept trying to seat us at a regular table, (its difficult for her to sit upright in a chair without falling off). \"I'll have to check on that\" he kept saying. My clearly disabled friend needed to sit down, and said, \"We will sit here\" as she walked determined toward the original booth she had chosen, oddly in front of a window that peeked into the kitchen. Evidently there were no \"reservations\" because the manager did not evict us.  My friend began calling for the manager immediately when she noticed him a few tables over. She wanted to make sure I got a replacement for the soggy salad I had gotten stuck with last time, and she had gripes about the staff refusing to help her get to the handicapped service elevator. When the manager came over, she explained first how none of the staff would help her get to the elevator to come up to the restaurant, and then went on about my soggy salad saga. The manager said he would take care of it & we ordered our food. I ordered the Beef Short Rib Enchiladas. I had them previously so I knew what should be coming. Or so I thought.   When my food arrived, the plate looked sparse at first glance & unappealing. Something didn't seem right. The edges of the enchilada were curled up & hard, with no saucy suppleness, causing me to touch them with my finger. \"What?!!\" It was hard as a ROCK...Literally!! Not only the tortilla wrap was hard, the MEAT was PETRIFIED for 2-inches on each end!! It looked like it had been waaayyyy overcooked in a microwave...you know what I mean...when you overcook something and it gets really soft at first, and then it gets so hard that you can nail it to the floor like a 2x4?!! Yeah, THAT HARD!!  It was so hard that I was tapping on the meat & it made a KNOCKING SOUND!! It was GROSS!! When I showed the manager, I asked nicely if they use a microwave, because it had that kind of texture.   He said, \"No we don't use a microwave\" assuring me, without any kind of apology, as he took the plate away.After the manager left, I realized...I have no desire to eat. My appetite was crushed. The food looked disgusting when it arrived, and it killed any hunger I had. So I began watching for the server or manager to cancel my order. My chair faced the kitchen window and I could see the manager talking to the line cooks. Then I watched a cook walk over and place oblong shaped food items  (think \"enchilada\") with his hand directly into a metal box, not on any plate, just directly into the microwave oven, then closes the door, and presses buttons...Gee, a MICROWAVE, imagine that? So much for \"Not cooking with a microwave\" according to the manager of the Herb Box, I guess?   There is SO MUCH else to say, but I am out of room to tell you...suffice it to say, I do not recommend this establishment under any terms whatsoever!!",

The most recent visit was only for a drink and appetizers, although I've enjoyed amazing entree's in the past.  (They do offer nice Happy Hour specials during the work week.)   I ordered an appetizer of crisp Brussel Sprout leaves and their version of a Moscow Mule; \"Mellon Mule.\"  The drink was so fresh and cold; yum.  The Brussel Sprout appetizer was TO DIE FOR.  Crispy individual leaves with a light creme sauce and amazing seasoning scattered on the dish.  I was in heaven.  Love, love, love their food.......  But...the reason I'm withholding the 5th star for The Herb Box is the condition of their Ladies Restroom.  The sink needs to be replaced and the beautiful tile on the floor needs a good cleaning.  This part of the restraint smells quite musty.",

I went here the other night for dinner:  The Highlights:  * Aesthetics - I just love the look of this place.  I don't know why but it really appeals to my eye. * Assorted breads and chips that come with the tzatziki and hummus platter - Hot, fresh, fluffy, and delicious.  The hummus is just ok though.  The tzatziki is pretty good. * Duck, corn and poblano crepes - The crepe was delicate and tasty.  The filling was equally as special.  The tender pieces of duck combined with corn and poblano was an excellent combination.  I would definitely get these again. * Corn and goat cheese flatbread - Very tasty and enough to share  The Lowlights:  * Smoked gouda mac and cheese - It just wasn't thick and creamy how I like it and gouda is just weird to put in mac n' cheese.  Also, rosemary doesn't belong in food.  I don't like eating potpourri.  * Roasted chicken - Eh.  It was pretty tender and juicy but just needed more flavor. * Ice cream sandwich thing for dessert - Again this was just eh.  It was like eating ice cream in a bun.",

I wanted to ask for my money back and walk out. However the group that I was with felt very awkward doing that but they agreed.   I will never be back to this place.

The Shrinking Violet was awesome!  Pricey, but oh so yum. We split a couple of appetizers.  We were not at all disappointed by any of them. I could have stuck a straw in the broth of the Shrimp and Smoked Jalapeno Rioja Butter and just sucked it all up, really.  That good. The hype on here about the Market Street Short Rib Tacos, not a lie.  So good.   And finally the Brown Sugar Jerk Pork Sliders.  Tasty.  Really really really tasty.

The location on the Scottsdale canal is really nice and there's a large patio that takes advantage of this. The menu has so many different options and tastes that a variety of people will enjoy. There is also a take out area, that has a small markets selling some of the favorites (hummus, salads, etc) Servers are always helpful, professional and attentive.  Here are some of the menu items I have enjoyed and notes about them. I am disappointed that they took off their Falafel dinner option. It came with two dips, falafel, and a salad. They took it off the menu a little while ago!  Iced Teas- They always have a variety of flavors and they're all well balanced and delicious.  Tzatziki+Hummus+Olives+Pita- Their Red Pepper Hummus has a  nice subtle spice to it, and the white bean artichoke is out of this world awesome. It's not as creamy as most Middle Eastern hummus' I enjoy, but it is a different breed and done so well. The olives are a great variety and the pita is good.  Crisp Falafel with Tahini Yogurt Sauce and Greek Salsa- The falafel aren't heavy or overly spiced, they are very light and so perfect. I actually don't put them in the same vein as other Falafel because they are so different. Same as I wrote about for the hummus. They are some of my favorite falafel though. The Tahini has a subtle lemon flavor and it's incredible. I could eat it with a spoon. I always as for extra Greek Salsa because it's yummy as well.   Butternut Squash Corn Enchiladas- These are light but filling with incredible ingredients then blend well together (Cojita, Spiced Pecans, Tomatillo- it works)  The Grow Happy Salad- Not your everyday salad. Pepitas, Pepperoncinis. Feta. Just awesome and filling in it's own right.  I want to try Brunch soon. The Red Velvet Pancakes are calling to me.",

I'm not going to bitch because I wasn't greeted by anyone, I could care less.  We sat at the bar, and sat, and sat.  Numerous servers walked by with no type of acknowledgment or to even maybe get the bartender.     The bartender finally came and showed no interest in serving us.  After enjoying our drinks I asked to close out my tab.  That took 20 minutes.  It was only my company and myself and two other patrons at the bar.  I gave my card as soon as he brought the check.  It actually took so long that I left my friend at the bar to sign my name so I could run down and go to FnB so they didn't think I was bailing on my reservation.     Now I'm not being overly sensitive, I'm just pointing out that this was piss poor service and exactly opposite of how the hospitality business should be run.

    "text": "Me: hey my family would like to do our annual gift exchange brunch, can we make a reservation please? Herb box: New location who dis?  Ok, to start, every time I've been to the old location I would have rated it a 5 star, then a 4 star, then a 3 star, and well, after giving this place another chance, I'm going to cut my losses. I guess I've fallen out of love with this place. I'll leave it for the other reviewers. More for them!  Second, our server was great. Taylor. Studette, if you will. My mom's meal just seemed off so she was very accommodating and apologetic. She brought us drinks and everything very quickly and with a pleasant smile on her face. I felt bad for her at the end because I knew she was afraid to take my plate away. 2-4 bites taken - 1 by me and the rest by everyone who didn't believe me. The Salmon Hash. Sit down and buckle up, you're about to go on a wild tangent with me.  I was trying to think of a word to describe my food and torrid came to mind, but that would be doing it a favor. Torrid implies the food was not only dry, but hot. This was lukewarm at best. The best word I could use to describe it was sock.  It tasted like I was trying to eat, chew, and swallow a sock. Now I'm not going to go into detail about how I know this, what my wife and I do behind closed doors is our business, but everyone else agreed, so maybe they're all freaks in the sheets too. Sock. A dry sock. I was going to dip my bites into my iced tea but my iced tea pulled away from me and said \"don't you put that shit in here\". I bought a $15 single sock.   Everyone who got the pancakes finished them, so there's that.   Also they didn't have any music on. I know this sounds petty. But it really does change the ambiance. I felt like I was at Luby's Cafeteria, listening to the clanking of plates and flatware, and screeching chair sounds. I could hear the old people slowing decaying as they carefully gummed their green jello cubes, watching it jiggle as their arthritic hands shook the spoon.  I can't next time... and I won't. I'm excited to see what goes in this location next.",

    "text": "This restaurant deserves nothing less than 5 stars and everyone else who ranked this lower doesn't know what they're talking about.   We're foodies in town visiting from San Diego, originally from NYC, and my fiance picked this out for dinner and it was nothing short of fantastic. The food is delicious, the drinks strong, the service attentive (ask for Andy) and the prices a great value for the quality received.   We can't remember a menu that has so many unique and special dishes as this one. At most restaurants you have a few special dishes and a lot of standard ones. Not here. This is something else.   The Kimchi Cauliflower rocked our world right off the bat followed by the mind blowing Brussels Chips and then the draw dropping Kale and Sweet Onion Pakora. We've never had and man this stuff was awesome. An amazing mix of salty and sweet with just the right amount of crisp and crunch.   I came in with my eyes set on the Short Rib Beef Enchiladas but after hearing their vegetarian enchiladas have won best vegetarian dish in Arizona two years running I had to give it a whirl. Man was this dish delicious. The enchiladas, smothered in a homemade green sauce with a slight kick,  were delightfully crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a deliciously fresh side salad to accompany.   My fiance had the Thai Baby Back Ribs, served with a side of Mac and Cheese, and it melted in her mouth. The entire dish was packed with flavor and the ribs fell right off the bone. Couldn't have been better.   We had our dog with us and they were nice enough to sit us on the patio, which we had all to ourselves. Andy was a fantastic server who broke down each dish and gave us his recommendations, which we took.   This is a must for anyone looking for a healthy, delicious and filling meal. We loved this so much were coming back for brunch on Saturday.",

I'd say the rad-u-locity of the phenomenon pretty much felt like a unicorn parade just stomped right on through my life!   If you're looking for a quick, healthy and delicious meal, look no further. You've got options here!  From the delicious starters of Crisp Brussel Sprout Chips and Edamame to the incredible Serrano Shrimp Salad (with avocado toast hiding below the greens) I was at no loss for flavorful and tasty ways to enjoy my veggies. Seriously though, this salad was one of the best I've had in awhile just based on what I enjoy, which were the warm, succulent shrimp, sweet and tangy vinaigrette and of course, the discovery of avocado toast down below the bed of arugula.   Service was prompt and the space felt open and airy with plenty of natural light. If I were to be around this area more often, it would definitely be a go-to spot for me based on my first experience.   Veggies never tasted so good!",

Why call it avocado love when there's hardly any avocados (3 small pieces not even slices, really?). Maybe arugula love? It was good and the sweetness of the agave dressing balances with the arugula, but dunno if I'll order it again if I want avocados with my meal.

I can't even remember all the things we sampled. I know we had the vegan app sampler and it was really good. I'm not a huge kale fan, but everything else on it was jammin! The brussels sprout chips, the korean cauliflower, the edamame. So good!!! Almost made me want to be vegan. Ok, not quite, but I did enjoy it.  There were other things people ordered that we all shared. For my entree I ordered the short rib tacos. OMG! They were delicious. And so much food!!! I actually made 4 tacos from the two tacos that were served, and still couldn't eat it all. The ribs were so tender and amazingly delicious. Probably my favorite dish that I ate my whole visit to Scottsdale.  I did also sample someone's butternut squash and corn enchiladas. Again, amazing! Who knew you could make enchiladas out of butternut squash and make them taste sooo good!?!  Our server was really awesome, was able to keep up with all of our requests. I really need to come back here.",

For starters, I love the new location. Nothing against the previous location along the canal but this new spot on 5th Ave is so much better because of the outdoor patio.  Okay, let's get to the food and service. I had the breakfast tacos and my wife had the salmon hash. AMAZING on both. You just know when you get freshly prepared food and both our meals were excellent.  The $5.00 Bloody Mary's were very tasty with the right balance of mix, spice and booze and the fresh cucumber and olive garnish was delicious.  Lastly, our experience would not have been what it was without Madeline, our server. After many years of working in the hospitality business, hotels, restaurants, brew pubs, etc... I know great service when I see it and Madeline was 100% on it!  The Herb Box is now one of the few places that we will make our regular place to go for breakfast or lunch. LOVE IT!",

Toasted, almost nearly burnt - had to be careful with braces.   I sat on the patio since it was a really nice view of the canal. BAD IDEA.

While we didn't eat we both agreed the menu looked really intriguing and warranted a speedy return visit",

I wasn't super impressed with the margarita, but I'm not a big drinker so it takes a well crafted cocktail to get me pumped on a drink. Ive had the butternut squash enchiladas 4-5 times now and they blow my mind every single time. The smokiness of the pepitas with the tomatillo sauce is an amazing flavor combo. I end up scraping the plate clean every time. I've also had brunch items and theyve been just as fresh and delivious as the enchiladas. The location is perfect for walking around after your meal!",

Started off with a legit Mango Mimosa. Service was excellent, they made an exception and gave me one breakfast taco as a side to the Simple Breakfast with extra bacon. Seriously, can't turn down a chance to sample a breakfast taco.   The ambiance is perfect for Sunday brunch, we sat outside beneath big shade trees and right next to the river (or canal depending on your definition).  Bottom line: best brunch we have had in quite some time.",

    "text": "Updated.  Talk about going from hero to zero.   I came by to visit and we were a few minutes before closing time. Which means we should have been able to do business at this location because it was within normal store hours. I called the number on the door and asked to speak to a manager who seemed extremely bothered by my call and was not very pleasant to deal with. I explained I I rush from the other side of town in order to get there before they closed and someone had closed the market early. I did not expect anything for it, but I did want to make the manager aware of it. His attitude was so disturbing that I will not return and I was made to feel that this business is very inconsistent.  Feel free to read my glowing review from a previous visit. Things have obviously changed here.  Past review.   We planned on having dinner at the restaurant however due to the event happening that closed off all the entrances we found it easier to just order from the little downstairs counter.  Firstly, the blonde (sorry I didn't get her name) behind the counter was awesome. Just to show you that great customer service can make up some imperfections. She knew the menu, was happy to accommodate us on her little patio seats, recommended some awesome items for a gluten free diet and was extremely genuine and cordial.  That said, we opted for the oatmeal cream filled cookie while we waited for takeout. It was awesome and highly recommended. Our takeout consisted of the plantain appetizer and two different enchilada entrees. The beef was much better than the chicken.  There was no to go silverware, the enchilada containers leaked a bit and did not seem to seal correctly (lost a star on that).  I would come back. This time I will come earlier and just order a panini from the nice lady downstairs. :)",

We got the Thai ribs but I would have called it Korean Ribs for it was glazed with some sort of bbq sauces mixed with the Korean pepper taste.   Their cucumber Mojito is very refreshing. I highly recommend it.   Overall, I really liked the place but the food just wasn't as great as I expected. The Butternut Squash and Corn Enchilada was a wasted dish. I couldn't even taste the butternut squash and it was too dry, despite the fact that it was drenched in the sauce.   I think the problem is, the name of the food items are more tasty than the dishes themselves. I personally love True food and vegetables so I might give this place another chance but it was just A-OK.   One positive thing to note is that it really has a romantic ambience and the service is excellent. Seated outside, with the surrounding lights of downtown Scottsdale, I felt like I was in France. So, if you're looking for a good first date place, I would recommend it.",

Herb Box is good, not knock your socks off good, but definitely satisfies and I love that it is local and semi-healthy (depending on what you order).  The food itself would have been 4 stars, but I knocked down half a star for the service and half a star for the price (too expensive for what you get).  I went with a party of 3 at 4:15, so it was an awkward time but I still expect to be served well, especially since it was't so busy. There seemed to be a lot of staff walking around, but for some reason there was only one waiter serving the entire inside of the restaurant (about 4 other parties). So, we flagged down another waitress and she took our order and sent it to the kitchen, which was nice.  We ordered the mac & cheese, the korean cauliflower, the market salad, beef short rib enchiladas, and the corn and goat cheese flat bread. My sister got a green flash beer, also.  The entrees were all great! I would have preferred if my chicken was cut up and tossed into my salad instead of having huge chunks on top, but it was moist and well seasoned. I appreciate the fact that they respected my wishes for EXTREMELY light dressing on my salad--overdressed salads are disgusting.The flat bread was great, and my sister said the enchiladas were also good.  I didn't particularly care for the mac & cheese. The portion was pretty small, the noodles were a little over cooked, and it wasn't the cheesy. The cauliflower, however, was spectacular! Need to learn how to make that at home.  I love the ambiance of the herb box! The decor is very modern-anthropologie-ish and the bathrooms are gorgeous. I noticed that theres a large room in the back for parties, also. Their outdoor seating looked nice too, but it was too cold the day I went.  Overall, a great spot! I would love to come here for breakfast or brunch. I'm sure the service is usually better, but the prices are definitely a little steep.",

I'm a patient person but I finally had to let the hostess know and I guess the two of them found it funny!

I went into the small coffee shop underneath the restaurant not realizing it was 2 different parts of the same place. Since I was by myself and not necessarily looking for a long sit-down meal, the coffee shop served my purposes well.  I ordered a bowl of the white bean chicken chili and a cup of hot tea. The chili was incredible. Not too heavy and with a sauce drizzled on top that I thought at first might not be that great - gosh was I wrong! Whatever the sauce was it completely made the chili. I could have very easily had another bowl if not for the price!   The tea was an organic chai that I ended up not liking but there are several organic teas to choose from. It was also served in a very small cup though I imagine they will give you more hot water if you ask. I didn't ask as I didn't like the tea I chose - didn't complain either because  I chose it. ;-)  Overall the food is out of this world. The service was exceptional. The prices were high.

We met up with some friends from California for lunch recently at the Herb Box, It was a good experience, atmosphere/service but something has changed in the menu.  We ordered salads and enchilada dishes, but the portions seem much smaller than the old menu.  Comically light actually.  Our party left hungry.  The 'less-is-more' trrend seems to be proliferating amongst high-end restaurants, presumably encouraging customers to order more courses.  But I find it insulting to the customer.  We can always choose to eat less than what's on the plate, but undersized portions gives us little option.  This is a fatal flaw IMHO.",

Two cocktails, an appetizer, 2 salads and it was $80!!! What!! We just had the same meal the day before at 5th and wine for half the cost with better service! Back to Herb Box...great atmosphere! Liked the flavor of the appetizer Avocado Love but all the stems on the arugula were distracting & unpleasant. We both had salads. My friend had the Shrimp & Avocado salad with similar salad garnishing the appetizer which our distant & unpleasant service fore warned. But on the upside the shrimp was tasty!My Steak salad had a small very tough. The flavor was good but again like the other salad both were filled with Stems!! Arugula on hers and watercress on mine...the photo was only half of the stems I picked out trying to enjoy the salad. Our Bloody Mary's were the best part of the meal! When I mentioned politely about the stems in both salads and showed her our discarded stems she shrugged & walked off! Insult to injury the lunch was the most expensive lunch I have had and a truly disappointing one!! 5th & Wine, Olive & Ivy, Sauce or several others within walking distance cost you less than $80 without tip. I don't mind paying that much if the food & service warrant but we paid a lot for lettuce stems...and it wasn't adjusted off the bill at end/ at least one should have been complimentary",

    "text": "We have grown to like this Herb Box, but still miss the one up in DC Ranch.    Don't get me wrong, it's still there.  But when I worked up near DC Ranch, we use to go there all the time.  That location (on Thompson Peak) has a strong Take-out  business mostly because it gets easily crowded with parents with kids.  So on a mild day, the Take-out is the way to go.  Actually, their Take-out  business is called Herb Box Market and it is marketed as a \"food boutique concept that offers customers a worldly and sophisticated retail setting that features an extensive array of freshly prepared meals including the casual catering-to-go line\".  Gabi M has written a glowing Five Star review of their catering business which you can read.  This location in Old Scottsdale also has a Take-out business, but it's downstairs and out of the way and seems less crowded when we've been here for lunch.    As you walk into The Herb Box, I would readily agree with Andy M, it does feel like you're eating in a Crate & Barrel!   But, that's not a bad thing, nor is it reflected in my Four Star rating.    One time, we sat near the old style turn of the last century bicycle, with the large front wheel.   All I could think about during our meal was that 60's TV show, with Patrick McGoohan called \"The Prisoner\".  LOL  We've had most of the items on the menu, but tend to gravitate to the Smoked Turkey Ciabatta ($12.00) with gouda cheese, bacon, sweet tomato and roasted red pepper aioli mayo which was very tasty.  It comes with sweet potato chips which are delicious.  Ask your server for a side of the red pepper aioli sauce for dipping.  It's mildly spicy, but works well with the chips.  We have also tried their Blackened Chicken Caesar Salad ($13.00).  It's slightly different then the other blackened chicken we've tried, but nice.  It comes with romaine lettuce, dried cherries, cotija, tortilla strips and a chipotle-parmesan vinaigrette.  I really believe it's the dried cherries that work best with the dressing that make the salad, but I would skip the tortilla strips.  The other entree we seem to enjoy is their Turkey Apple Swiss Wrap ($13.00) it has Turkey with dried cranberries, smoked bacon, and greens.  It also comes with sweet potato chips.  Remember the aioli mayo!  The wait staff is very good at The Herb Box and they work very hard at anticipating drink refills.  We sat in John's section for our last visit and he was great!  Enjoy!",

The menu was loaded with all my favorite combinations of flavors, and the sort of creative twists that I look for at brunch spots, plus they boasted using quality/local/organic ingredients. To make it better the decor was modern, the energy seemed high, beautiful outdoor seating, and live music.  However, the food didn't live up. It seems like they scouted a bunch of cool west coast restaurants, crafted a menu using all of their ingredients, but don't really know how to capitalize? Or maybe they are just using buzz words to appeal to people who read healthy food blogs? I dunno... to be fair, maybe I miss-ordered, the sandwiches looked good, anyway...  The \"Market Sunflower Salad\", was literally a huge bowl of the most unappetizing, lifeless, romaine lettuce I have ever seen, with a skimpy handful of seeds and dried fruits--the kind that restaurants in the midwest use during the winter because they are an inexpensive non-perishable way to give their salads a bit of color. The goat cheese was near non-existent. The chicken breast actually looked pretty good... which makes sense, because for $15 you had better get something worth eating.  \"Sweet Potato Avocado Baja Bowl\" ...boasting roasted sweet potatoes, avocado, queso, fried plantains, quinoa, and a creamy jalapeno avocado dressing... a combo of some of my favorite things in a bowl? How could I resist.  Wow... was this depressing. Now to defend the infant sized portion I was given (for $13), I will concede that maybe it is meant for like dieting vegans? However, if that is the case... the waiter should inform people of that. It was literally a spoonful of each ingredient. Luckily I added a fried egg (to make it more breakfasty), either way I had to stop on the way home to get a real meal. Also... don't be fooled by the delicious wording \"rosemary coriander roasted sweet potatoes\" ... I got a dozen tiny sticks of nearly raw sweet potatoes--no flavor to speak of. Also the creamy dressing that sounded so enticing, hardly made the scene.  \"Bourbon-Ginger Peach Brioche French Toast\" ....OH MAN HOW COULD WE NOT GET IT! Especially based on the awesome yelp photos. So we order it, we get the standard 4 piece plate, only we must have gotten there when the kitchen was starting a new budget? We got 4 tiny squares of (canned????) peaches on top, and a helplessly minimal drizzle of the cream (which I can't say for certain, but highly doubt has anything to do with creme fraiche). The \"bourbon ginger\" flavors didn't have much to say... but I will say that the texture and richness of the actual toast was pretty good.  To top things off... the waitstaff seemed like they had been plucked off the streets (obviously I can only speak for a couple). Honestly not a big deal, they were all EXTREMELY nice and helpful, but just clearly had not been waiting tables for long. Which like I said, doesn't bother me normally... but at this sort of price tag, you expect the eatery to be putting a little more effort into curating their team.  Conclusion...  It seems like a spot that has created an atmosphere and menu that capitalizes on as many current trends as possible, with the end goal to make people feel like they are at some edgy eatery where the high price tag is matched with top-notch quality. The problem is that you can't just give your dishes cool names, you need to have the culinary innovativeness to bring the unique flavors/ingredients to life! And I just didn't feel that here...  If your looking for a locally-inspired/inventive/hip/edgy/modern/American-new style meal... take your hard earned cash elsewhere.  If your looking for a good sandwich and are already in the area.. check this place out.",

Clearly you didn't get any help from a PR agency on how to close a location gracefully (especially since you still have locations in this city). You should have called me, apologized for the inconvenience and then offered me a 25% discount to move my party of 14 to your Stetson location. Too bad you handled this so poorly.",

There were fake plants on the tables. I think it would have been nice if there were real herbs or something. It would be more fitting to the namesake.   The service was spot on.   Bloody Mary's were only $5. They have a great amount of spice and seasoning. Ordered the avocado love (4.5 stars). I thought it was going to be much more avocado forward but the fennel and arugula really elevated the taste. There was something sticky on top so I kind of wish it came with a wipe. The smoked salmon hash (3.5 stars) was just ok. There was a lot of kind of crispy smoked salmon that wasn't my fav. The chilaquiles (4 stars) were not exactly normal chilaquiles. It was kind of a pulled pork stew you put into the tortillas with egg. Good verde sauce!",

    "text": "So I went here for Brunch on Mother's Day with my mom and sister. We had a reservation at 9:00 am, we tried to get a reservation for 10:00 but they told us they were all booked throughout the day and 9:00 was the only time that could hold seats for us. When we got there the restaurant was mostly empty, with maybe three other tables dining with servers and employees standing around, and it stayed that way throughout the entire course of our meal. We left around 10:15ish and I think maybe two other tables showed up.  When we made the reservation they did not tell us that for Mother's Day they were doing a buffet, they didn't seem to announce this on social media either. The buffet was alright, but it was mostly if not entirely composed of regular menu items sitting out. Most food was room temperature or just straight up cold. I ended up eating the Korean cauliflower, roasted edamame, peach french toast, and veggie enchiladas, all of which are regular menu items. Each one of these dishes seemed wrong in some way. The cauliflower had virtually no sauce on it and was totally bland, despite being labelled \"Korean\" and coming with sauce, the french toast was cold, and the peaches on it came in small cuts, the enchiladas were extremely cold, and the cheese on top wasn't melted, and the way they roasted the edamame caused the shells to split open, losing edamame beans. I counted three shells that were burnt to a crisp with no edamame inside. This method also doesn't really do anything to make the edamame taste any different from traditionally steaming them.  I went to their bathroom midway through my meal and it was unkempt, and they were out of toilet paper. I had to make use of their paper toilet seat covers that seemed haphazardly thrown around the stall in individual boxes in order to get my business done. Tearing open a box, and then ripping the seat cover inside up so it was useable.   By the end of the meal the check came out, and the hostess/server told us not to bother tipping because it was included in the price which was 123 dollars for three people. Absolutely absurd given that I'm almost certain everything on that bar is a regular menu item you could pay 15 dollars or less for, but that wasn't the end. When our checks were brought back to us they added a 20% gratuity bringing the total cost of each meal to just short of $50. Total scam. The cauliflower is probably good if it's warm, but I could've gotten basically the same thing at various restaurants around town for under ten dollars, and it would've been hot, and had sauce. I am tempted to give this restaurant two stars since the food wasn't awful, but then I remember they charged me 50 dollars for a brunch buffet they didn't tell anyone about, and didn't even put toilet paper in the bathroom.",

    "text": "We were looking for some modern, imaginative Southwestern cuisine for lunch, and we found exactly that at The Herb Box.  Nearly all the menu items are creative, blending ingredients you're not likely to find elsewhere.   Five stars for imagination, for the kitchen's execution of these ideas, and for the well-organized and very attentive service (and this, 15 minutes before closing time.)  The plantain chip and dip appetizer was a nice starter, with the chips themselves as interesting as the dip.    The two entree salads that came to our table were fulfilling and full of fresh leafy, crunchy, and meaty elements in good proportion (i.e enough greens, a generous portion of protein, and just the right amount of seeds and dried fruit).  The dark pepper-based house made dressing on the shrimp salad was notable for being slightly sweet but with a strong kick.    The grilled cheese comes with sweet potato chips, the latter being about the only thing on the table that could be considered just OK.    Portions are generous. For dessert, the strawberry shortcake dessert was enough for 3 or 4 people.  The shortbread was a had a biscuit-like texture but was very moist, a rare and welcome combination.  I only wish I could go back to see what \"lemon meringue unpie\" could be.      Good for kids? I would have guessed  \"no\" except that I've never seen my five-year-old put away a whole grilled-cheese sandwich, especially one on such interesting, \"adult-oriented\" dark and grainy bread.    The ice teas were remarkably good, to the point that I felt sorry for what my Coke-drinking table mates were missing.",

Don't have to tell me twice!  I suggested The Herb Box for brunch with my gal pals the very next week.  Unfortunately, I was a little let down.  Its not that the food was bad by any means... it just wasn't anything special.  I had the Goat Cheese and Chive Omelet.  I was disappointed by the tiny sprinkling of goat cheese over the top of my largely flavorless omelet.  My gut said \"Red velvet pancakes!  Get the red velvet pancakes!\" -- clearly I should have trusted my instincts.  I will admit that I am moderately at fault here, because apparently Sunday brunch (not Saturday breakfast) is where its at.  I am still giving The Herb Box a well deserved four star rating for my good lunch experience and because I am hopeful that Sunday brunch and maybe some red velvet pancakes will make me forget all about my lackluster omelet.",

I've now tried the Grow Happy salad, the Vegan Nosh, and the Butternut Enchiladas, and all were really delicious, but the Vegan Nosh and Butternut Enchiladas are what I would call...special...above and beyond your usual lunch fare.  Vegan Nosh also has the presentation going for it with 4 different salads in 4 bowls on a wooden slab.  When I order it, people have a tendency to go \"wow, that's a lot of food\" and yeah, it is, but it's probably the same amount of food as a large salad (and twice as delicious).  This is not the cheapest place, but it is pretty, the food is pretty, and the food is delicious.  It's in my rotation for sure.",

The pita/hummus app, market sunflower salad, chilaquiles, pancakes and banana bread are our favorites. Also try one of their fresh juices, or our favorite, grab a bottle of sparkling wine/champagne with a creamer of mango puree on the side for a nice twist on mimosas. The atmosphere is relaxed yet eclectic. The flat screen tv at the bar is a plus too.  Highly suggest enjoying an afternoon beverage on the patio or at the outside part of the bar. The only criticism is that sometimes the staff appears a bit inexperienced, although always friendly. In particular, we were there today and waited for 20 minutes while a handful of tables sat empty on the patio with plenty of room for the couple reservations that were on the books. After your meal, set aside a few minutes to walk around the Market Street shops and check out the small park behind Grimaldi's.",

To be fair, we had a very large group and we landed all at once and may have overwhelmed the kitchen a bit. Hopefully that's just a hiccup.  What's to love? Well they had me at Herb Box. Several years ago I actually built a box out of redwood, filled it with soil, and grow herbs in it. So I was destined to eat here, and when we did eat I felt like they had plucked the herbs fresh from my own herb box in the backyard.  The salads were enormous and so very pretty. Because I'm an idiot I went with the heaviest non-herbiest thing on the menu - enchiladas. Don't get me wrong, they were top-notch and I scarfed them up in no time, but next time I'd go with lighter fare and really explore some fresh flavors.  Folks were ordering iced teas and lemonades left and right. Probably the perfect accompaniment to a flavorful salad or sammy.   I loved the decor. Loved how open it was. I remember a bright, airy dining room and by contrast the dark, sexy restroom. Yes, I just called the restroom sexy. Go check it out and tell me it's not sexy.  Sweet potato chips are a must-mention. They're not uber-heavy and have just enough seasoning to make you take notice.",

    "text": "Medical Marijuana is a reality in Arizona but you won't need a prescription to get a little \"Herb\" in old Town. As of January 1st 2011, The Herb Box Southbridge is open and serving up signature dishes to satisfy your munchies.  Helmed by Chef Becky Windels and business partner Susan Smederovac-Wilcox, the Southbridge location combines the catering division previously located further North with a new Market serving an extensive selection of farm fresh salads, soups, signature sandwiches and specials all prepared with fresh, local produce. (I even have it on good authority that neighborhood residents will be able to pick up staples like milk, important as there isn't a supermarket or convenience store in the immediate area).  The menu at The Herb Box Southbridge is virtually identical to that at the DC Ranch location I've written about previously, all fresh, all tasty.  Todays meal, pancetta wrapped shrimp served on a bed of mixed greens. This is one of my favorite plates on the menu.  Salty pancetta adds the perfect texture to plump shrimp and the blackberry wasabi reduction drizzled over it is just plain delicious (sweet with just the right amount of bite at the finish).  Next up, Smoked BBQ Chicken flat bread. Though the menu would lead you to believe the chicken is \"smoked,\" I would certainly disagree.  What I will say is that it's perfectly grilled, the crunchy bacon, sweet tomatoes, red onions and Gouda are a perfect compliment, but the organic greens perched atop, though tasty, just don't work for me on this item. (though it should be said, I generally don't love salad greens on anything more than sandwiches).  All in all, I'm excited that Old Town's first Herb dispensary is open for business and would definitely recommend you stopping by the market for a quick grab n go lunch or sitting upstairs in the warm and inviting dining room for a leisurely enjoyed meal.  **Disclaimer:  This visit was pre-opening at a \"mock service\" and was free of charge though this in no way influenced my opinion of the establishment.",

A friend of mine invited a group to come out for her husband's 40th B-day and it was a great experience. I look for both exceptional service and good food and this place met both criteria.  We had ordered wine for the dinner and the waiter noted they change their wine list on a regular basis. We had a bottle of the riesling, which was $35 and it was from the Mosel region in Germany, one of my favorite places, and literally, one of the best I've tried, delicious. I believe the bottle of red was a Merlot and it was also exceptional, super tasty. i also had, earlier at the bar, a glass of the Prosecco and it was perfect4 for the summer, light, sparkling, and a great way to start a meal and, because I'm a bit of a lush, I also tried a cocktail, some sort of mint julip made with rainwater vodka and cucumber juice, and loads of fresh mint. Even at $9 it was worth and the Prosecco I had on happy hour and it was only $5 - basically, the prices a re reasonable and well selected. A big shout out to Rico who was a great bartender and even laughed at my majorly lame Rico Suave joke.  Once at the table, the waiter was great. One of those people who keeps things on track and was helpful without coming to the table and asking how we liked the food every five minutes. My water glass was always full and the food was to the table in a timely manner, and the food, oh my god! I ordered the flash fried edemame with sea salt and have to say, good. Though they may want to look at the edemame with sea salt and truffle oil like they serve at the mint, it would go well here as well.  For dinner I had the vegan option, which is a number of vegetable dishes and they were all...amazing! The herb hummus came with cucumber slices and I loved the chickpea salad and the best part, the roasted beats with grapefruit, so amazingly good. I even tried some of a friends flank steak and it was quite tasty.   Oh, and they had a live blue grass band playing, which was wonderful. I ended up tipping them like $20 I liked them so much (and yes, that also meant I had a few drinks in me).  Bottom line though, one of the best dining experiences I've had in Scottsdale.  Only recommendation, expand the bar out, it feels rather small for the size of the place but I think they have the space they have so such is life. I rarely give out six starts so check this place out. I'm probably going to go back tomorrow and have brunch, which runs from 8 am to 11 am - looks like they have some great breakfast food and I can't wait to try it!",

Friday night we sat out on the patio overlooking The Scottsdale Canal (sorry, can't quite get into calling it The \"Waterfront\").   White Chicken Chili was fabulous, not too spicy and I ordered a side of toasted ciabatta bread for dipping/sopping up the wet parts. Yum.  One of their signature dishes was The Roasted Chicken--DEElish; so many grilled flavors on one plate; worth the 20 minute prep time!  Not quite a fan of the ciabatta bread used as a hamburger bun for the Kobe Burger (and the burger itself was only \"okay\") and the side for said meal was a bit of a turn-off for my husband and I agree that he should have been offered a different side with it...  Otherwise, great service, great atmosphere.  Yes, we'll be back (again).",

    "text": "Whenever we come to Phoenix, where to dine for dinner is a major decision. We are always relying on our friend Ryan to make the choice based on all the best places he has been to since our last trip out and then taking us to his favorite.    Ryan tripped us up a bit this time by providing us a list and making us choose from some that he had been to and some he has been wanting to go to.  After about an hour and a half of careful menu reviewing by the three of us we picked The Herb Box.  Had I gone down the list in 5 minutes it would not have been my first choice and I think the other two of us felt the same.  We made our final decision based on the menu seemingly being able to quench our three very different moods for chicken, steak and something different.   We arrived to an upscale looking place that really surprised us with elegant seating and our table was perfectly positioned near a welcoming fireplace.  The next best surprise, A honest server with a more exotic opinion on taste who was not afraid to add her own commentary, which I appreciate.  We started with shared plates and upon our servers suggestion we had the Korean fried cauliflower dish and the indian kale and corn pakora. I definitely left with a new found love of cauliflower and kale.    Ryan was pretty much bent on the Korean barbeque ribs from the moment we picked the restaurant and was really happy he made that choice.  Michael was talked out of the buttermilk chicken by our server based on her saying it was good but not as expressive as the more flavorful choices on the menu that highlight the chef's choices to mix unique flavors.  He ended up choosing the ribeye along with me, my choice the minute I read thru the menu.  The queso blanco and cilantro lime gave the perfectly cooked ribeye an extra special boost.  We also shared the crisp fingerling potatoes sprinkled with course salt and the skillet corn and leek gratin.  I was excited about the corn and blown away by the potatoes.  I am not a connoisseur of mac n cheese by any means but will never refuse a taste from someone else's plate to make sure that my life doesn't end without having possibly tasted \"The one redeeming recipe\" that actually validates the existence of that dish.  I tasted Ryan's and thought to myself, \"wow, I could eat a dish of that,\" it was very good.  The Herb Box was really enjoyed by all of us and we were very happy we went there.  Definitely one of the weekend highlights!",

It is cute and is in Old Town, so that's probably why the prices go up, but still. I seem to end up here for work lunches.  - Portabella burger with a side salad (an expensive side salad I might add, practically the cost of ordering the house salad but 1/3 of the size). It was fine, not mind blowing, but not terrible either. The mushroom was a little on the chewy side, and I wish they had put more of the flavorful aioli on it because the bun was very thick (and so much less flavorful). - Happy Salad as a Wrap: Definitely one of the better vegetarian entree options on the menu for a reasonable price ($9). It's a basic vegetarian salad (lettuce, tomato, cucumber) dressed and wrapped into a yummy tortilla, served with their sweet potato chips. - Cauliflower Lentil Bowl: Offensively tiny. For $13 you get 4 cauliflower florets and about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of lentils/quinoa. The flavors are extremely good (great mix of salty, savory, and sweet), but it was so tiny and not filling.   If you come and want a reasonably priced meal with meal-sized portions, it's best to stick with the sandwiches.",

The menu at Herb Box is filled with lots of options for salads, sandwiches, wraps, flatbreads (why can't we just call them pizzas?), and shared plates to start. I sampled the petite fromage - soft bread with capicola, honey cheddar and sea salt with a lovely little sweet salad. Caution: this is a very rich sandwich which is probably best eaten with a fork. Good luck picking it up!   Our party of 14-ish must have wrecked the kitchen, because our service was painfully slow. Our drinks came out quickly (try the Arnold Palmer) but orders of sweet potato chips didn't arrive for half an hour, and our meals about 10 minutes after that.

I asked if he had a happy hour menu we could look at.  He said he did not have one, and that he was real busy now but he would see if he could find one in five or ten minutes if we wanted to wait.  It did not even appear to be that busy.  We enjoyed happy hour elsewhere. We always go to the Herb Box when we are in town and have always had good food and service.  The management needs to give the host a lesson on dealing with the public.  And no I am not his \"bud\".",

You will def get a \"awww this place is cute\" from your date, certain guys and all girls. I sat outside so while I enjoyed the outdoor band, my bf enjoyed the basketball game on the many flat screens. Everything was great. Our waiter was hilarious and didn't mind we changed our opinion on how we wanted our steak down 3 times. Rare to well done to finally, at his suggestion, medium. The chairs are comfy, the food is fresh, and even the bathroom is nice. Really, there were people talking about the interior design of the bathroom while I was waiting in line. I got the stuffed chicken with goat cheese and my date got an open faced kobe. The meat not the Laker. They were both delicious. He loved the kobe. Now if only he felt the same way about the Laker version.",

I, the vegan among 4 omnivores, greatly enjoyed the indian-spiced kale + corn and onion pakora and avocado love.  Any place with a vegan dessert gets an extra star, but Yelp only allows 5.  My party enjoyed their meals as well and meals were very affordable ($105 for a party of 5 with entrees and 2 desserts, without alcohol -- another $48 for a round of drinks).  Wish I lived in town to enjoy this restaurant more often but it will be a demand of mine for all future Phoenix trips (corporate office here so hopefully frequent!).",

The entrance is hard to find, the greeter station is a huge dangerous bottleneck screaming for a patron to server pile-up, and I don't think they incorporated anything in the decor to absorb noise.  The place is so noisy our server couldn't hear us.  The live music was a nice thought, but ended up just adding to the insanity.    Too bad, because I loved my food and the service seemed very good once she heard us correctly.  I'll rush back if I hear they've redecorated.  In the meantime, there are just too many places in the neighborhood with good food, good flow and good acoustics.",

    "text": "The Herb Box is quite possibly my favorite lunch spot in Old Town.  It's definitely the first place to pop in my mind when someone asks where they/we should go to lunch.  The atmosphere is my second favorite part, next to the brown sugar pork ciabatta, which I'll get to in a minute.  The Herb Box offers a rustic/nautical feel, with white and blue wood throughout along with circular mirrors, resembling a sea-side eatery back home.  The inside is a funky combination of homey and trendy, providing a comfort that the food is going to be just as good.  It's always a toss-up to sit inside or out on the patio, no matter the time of year.  The dining room is hard to beat, but the outdoor patio is equally as great with the perfect amount of shade + misters for hot summer days.  Wherever you chose to sit, somehow find your way to the ladie's/men's room as the restrooms are probably my third favorite part of HB - never thought the bathrooms would make it into my reviews, but HB puts a touch of class on every aspect of their cafe.  Now on to the food: I have tasted a solid third of HB's menu.  Everything is good, I haven't had one thing that I was disappointed in.  As with many of my favorite restaurants, there is a reason it's a favorite because one item stands out above the rest.  The pork ciabatta does it for me.  I should start by describing how large the portion is - be prepared to take part of your lunch home unless you're super hungry.  The pulled pork is served with an interesting complement of jicama and red pepper slaw.  The flavors are so, so good.  Of course served on ciabatta, which who doesn't love ciabatta?  All of their sandwiches come with a side of their homemade sweet potato chips, which are definitely worth the carbs.  If you're feel frisky, order a side of their red pepper aioli to give your sweet potato chips a little zing.  My order isn't complete with one of their many flavors of iced teas.  I have recently become obsessed with their mango and green tea combo.  If you're making an event out of lunch or plan to stay longer, go for the cheeseboard of the moment as a starter.  My fiance and I are cheese-aholics, and their cheeseboard is delectable, accompanied with fruit, jam, honey and nuts - yum.  If you're wondering where to go on your tour of Old Town either as a tourist or a local, I hope you make a smart decision and go to the Herb Box, you will be so happy you did.",

They're amazing and you'll get tons of them. The decor is perfectly shabby chic with a traditional twist and I could seriously move in.

    "text": "This was just...  OK.  After hearing and reading so many great things about The Herb Box I was sure I would really enjoy it.  Well, no.  Not so much.  Especially disappointing because my Mom was with me during an all-too-brief visit to AZ, and I really wanted to take her somewhere great.    We arrived around 1:30, purposefully avoiding the 'lunch rush'.  I thought this would be a good thing.  What we found was a disorganized and distracted staff and a lot of uncleared tables.  Once we were seated and given menus, we were pretty much abandoned for a good 10 minutes.  At last a couple of glasses of water arrived, but the waitress disappeared again before we could place our order.  She came in and out of the dining area, seating others and even taking their orders, but didn't acknowledge us until I was ready to A) fold the menu into a paper airplane and aim it at her head and B) leave.  Helloooooooooo????  At last we were able to order.  Hooray!  Wait, don't get excited yet, she didn't enter the orders into the terminal.  Oops.  When we finally received our food it was not exactly worth waiting that long for, either.  I had the Market Sunflower Salad and my mom had the Blackened Chicken Caesar Wrap.  While good, I don't think either dish warranted the $12 price tags.  It is lettuce and chicken, people.  Really.  Yes, the location is 'cute' and 'quaint'.  Yes the ingredients are fresh.  Perhaps if we had a different waitress I would have been happier.",

I was delighted with my first visit to DC Ranch, but the drive is less and less likely to happen at $4 a guzzle. The Southbridge location did not disappoint. Our table on the patio facing the Waterfront was relaxing, beautiful, and perfect for a quiet Monday evening out. The interior was impressive and the bathrooms! A thorough review of the bathroom facilities is always an important part of my dining experience - these banos are sahweet!   Our server was one of the best I've ever had, and I come from a serving background. Very good knowledge and description of the food, perfect timing of table visits and a stellar attitude towards our preference for a snail paced meal.  The best part - those damn risotto cakes that I'm now dreaming about. We tried the pear and gorg pizza as well which was scrumptious and the market salad was so-so. I cannot wait to continue my way down the list of fresh and delicious items on the menu. Lovely, lovely place.",

Some of the vegetarian/vegan options here were so good - they were better than some of the meat items. Service was fast, the bartender (a vikings fan) was great. Fast, friendly, efficient, and made great drinks. He could sense when we were ready to leave, ready to order, without hovering. The only suggestion I could make for improvement was the hostess was a bit rude- she asked if we had a reservation and told us to wait with an ENTIRE empty restaurant (which never filled). She made us feel as though she did not want to seat us, and was not friendly about it. On the flip side, sitting at the bar ended up being a blessing as the service was faster and better than what I observed at the tables. I would recommend the corn enchiladas, and the chili cauliflower.",

    "text": "First let me address the decor. Everyone seems to love it, but I felt like I was eating inside of a Crate and Barrel store. One of the people with me said he felt like he was in a renovated Red Lobster. I do have to say the bathroom had some of the best lighting I've ever seen.  FOOD: All of us ordered the red velvet pancakes after seeing them reviewed on Chow Bella. I'm not really a pancake person, but I wanted to try it since it was something I had never had. They were truly great. Very rich, but very good. The Gran Marnier syrup was my favorite part. I had to ask for more. The bacon was tasty and crisp. I ordered a side of poached eggs. They were just a tad shy of done, too much of a runny white for my taste. And I should have ordered some toast or something to sop up the yolk with.   DRINKS: For their Sunday brunch, you can get any entree and bottomless mimosas, bloody marys, or screwdrivers for $24. The most expensive entree is $15 and the drinks stand-alone are $5, so you would need to have at least 3 drinks to make this a worthwhile \"deal\", but it is brunch. Booze it up.  SERVICE: Spotty. It wasn't really very busy and it was difficult to get the attention of the waitress. We asked for separate checks (I know, scandalous in Scottsdale) but were told that would be no problem. Then the check came as a group. No biggie.  Would definitely go back, but will get the steak and eggs next time.",

As stated by my first word in the review, the food here is really good. The menu is for sure trendy and filled with all the buzz words that 5 years ago nobody would understand. Don't matter though. Also being right near the \"waterfront\" the interior is really airy and the whole place has a nice ambiance to it.

If you have the time, I could see myself hanging out with friends and letting the conversation continue until the lunch crowd has just about cleared out.",

Great ambiance and service has always been outstanding.",

My husband says it just gives me something to look forward to when we travel, but I think it couldn't hurt to have at least two places like the Herb Box in my town!  I adore the sun-filled dining area and the delicious Arnold Palmer. You can even get it made with decaf tea, and I did!   The menu had no shortage of delicious sandwiches, flatbreads and perfect lunch items (short rib tacos anyone?), but I decided to go green with the Grow Happy Salad. However, I did add steak. The salad with steak was perfect- a big heaping pile of mixed greens, a delicious red wine vinaigrette, and toasted pepitas! I have to love a salad with nuts.   We also had a platter of baked goods for dessert, and I will say that for the most part, I thought they were a little dry, so perhaps save room for something sweet down the street.   Our party was huge, and the service was painfully slow as a result. If you head there with a large party, I recommend splitting up into smaller groups perhaps.",

Supposedly there was avocado, bacon, onions, and tomatoes but I guess they just waved those over the salads because they were virtually non-existent in the two salads for which we paid over $30. And it never ceases to amaze me how a \"professional\" cook/chef(?) can turn a perfectly good chicken breast into an inedible, dry piece of shoe leather and call it \"blackened\". Why not just call it inedible. Stay away from this overrated, over priced, unskilled, pretentious place at all costs. Unless you like throwing money away on really bad food.",

    "text": "Having gone to the now-closed location on Shea, I didn't expect to find myself at the new The Herb Box anytime soon.  My one visit was fine, but didn't leave me wanting more.  However, when Deb L hosted a recent UYE, it was the perfect opportunity for great company at the very least.  Well I'm happy to report I received even more than great company....great food, great service, and comfortable, yet beautiful surroundings were also on the plate.    I began the evening with a glass of their house-made sangria.  I could drink this light and fruity beverage all day.  In fact, I think it would make a fine substitute for my morning OJ.  I did have a hard time choosing an entree.  While I was tempted by the pear and gorgonzola flatbread, I chose the goat-cheese chicken instead.  The shoulder cut chicken was perfectly cooked, but the meat itself was perhaps a little bland, although admittedly I do prefer chicken to be well-seasoned.  The goat cheese stuffing and the fig jam, however, resulted in an overall quite tasty dish.  I loved the mushroom risotto cakes served alongside!!  The Herb Box also graciously offered our table a variety of sweet treats at the end of the meal...a slice of fig bundt cake (my favorite), a couple different cupcakes, a whoopie pie, and a passionfruit cake.  While all were enjoyed, none of these wowed me.  I do think these may have been pastries available at the market, and not their dessert menu items.     So thanks to Deb for giving me a reason to try The Herb Box.  I'm sure I will be back again!  I didn't get a chance to browse the market!",

My first visit was for brunch..I had the famous red velvet pancakes. Oh laaarwd...honey. Those pancakes are a religious experience. I don't remember what else we ordered because the pancakes were stupid-good. As if it wasn't enough, I had a couple of mimosas too. I'd say it was um....better than...most breakfasts I've had.   The second time was a laaazy lunch with a girlfriend. We each has a flatbread she Brussel sprout and pancetta on the recommendation of our server,  I had pear and gorgonzola. Let me begin by saying that pear and gorgonzola is one of my favorite flavor combinations..and brussel sprouts, decidedly not. BUT, here, the sprouts are grilled and that pancetta is that salty goodness. OHHHHHHHH-MY. That flatbreat blew my pear and gorgonzola out of the water.   We also had a couple of drinks off their drink menu, I had a cucumber water-mint number with vodka that was perfectly refreshing for a summer day in Scottsdale. My girlfriend had a raspberry mojioto (if I remember correctly) and it was pretty fabulous as well. Don't tell anyone..but we didn't stop at one.   Out server was a pro. She has us at \"go\". She was funny and attentive and patient with our endless requests for more water and limes. I can not NOT for the life of me remember her..but she was fantastic and a pro.  If you go, get those red velvet pancakes..and listen when your server makes a recommendation..they know their stuff there.",

    "text": "The food at this restaurant is simply delightful in presentation, smells and taste.   I went to this location as part of a UYE hosted by Deb L., went with my best Sara V and was looking forward to trying this place after reading the many five star accolades and reviews of this restaurant. I do not give out five stars often but if I was to base it on the atmosphere, and decoration of this restaurant, it would be five stars BUT five stars are for the food and the food is a five star delight.   Sara V and I decided to share two apps and split an entree. We ordered the Petite Grilled Fromage (capicola, seahive cheddar, salad rouge) and the Proscuitto Wrapped Shrimp (blackberry glaze + spicy soy mustard), followed by a split order of the Thai BBQ Baby Back Ribs and Green Apple Slaw with jicama & watercress + smoked gouda mac-n-cheese. The petite fromage was delicious and the salad rouge had so many flavors with the avocado, and the golden raisins. It was a party of flavors with every chew and the melted cheddar enveloped the brioche bread just right, it was heaven. And the OMG moment came from the Proscuitto Wrapped Shrimp, served on a skewer, the blackberry glaze complemented the salad served with the shrimp, and the glaze provided the sweet with tangy of the spicy soy mustard, there were so many flavors to enjoy that it was a \"as good as it gets\" moment!   Our entree was another winner with BBQ baby back ribs, the flavors derived from the the sauce was just delicious, it complemented well with the apple slaw. I think the disappointment with our entree was the smoked gouda mac-n-cheese because I hardly could taste the gouda, and panko bread crumb topping didn't help the dish or do justice, it was quite bland and out of place for a flavorful dish.   Our party was treated to a dessert sweet board of goodies courtesy of the Herb box, on this confectionary tray was a red velvet cupcake, a fig apple bundt cake, a rootbeer cupcake, a passionfruit type cake and a chocolate type pastry. The Red velvet cupcake topping was yummy but the cupcake itself was moist somewhat but not throughout, the passionfruit had a good outer shell, but my favorite sweet treat was the fig apple cake, it reminded me of strudel.   Overall, i enjoyed my UYE dinner, making new friends. And I did love the food made by Becky (the chef/owner). our appetizers and entree was delicious and I look forward to coming back for lunch/dinner and hopefully Sunday brunch.",

I sat at a table for awhile before a server greeted me, so it wasn't off to a great start. However, once we got our food, it was back to what I know and love from Herb Box. The Sunflower Salad is my favorite dish and it never disappoints. The iced green tea is also delicious, especially on a hot AZ day.  I will continue to come to Herb Box because the food is great. Hopefully, the slow service on Saturday was just a fluke and I can update my review the next time I visit, which I am sure won't be too long away.",

The host stand is in a busy area, and my mom was trying to stand out of the way, but the host came by and literally shooed my mom to get out of his way. It was incredibly rude! We tried to get passed it, sat down and ordered. The food took a long time (we all ordered salads and a veggie bowl), and when it arrived it wasn't right. My friend's salad came with no dressing, and no corn, and my sister's corn was replaced with quinoa. We searched and searched for our waiter, and were finally able to flag down a manager who explained that they were out of corn so it was just left off the salad, and brought dressing. Our waiter should have notified us that they were out of something, and you should not just replace it with another option without asking, especially as someone could have a food allergy. The waiter also flew by once to bring my sister the wrong drink. At the end of the meal the waiter finallllly stopped by once we had paid to confront us for not letting him know we had an issue with our food, and to give us advice for eating at restaurants in the future. We told him we tried to let him know, but we couldn't find him the whole time we were eating. At that point we were really upset, and spoke to the manager who apologized. Our check for 4 salads and tea was $70 and soooo not worth it, especially considering the horrible customer service. We will never be back.",

I would give the atmosphere and service five stars as well. The place has a really open feel and the patio looked very inviting. The service was unobtrusive yet attentive. My water glass never ran empty.  The place they lost me was the food. I ordered steak and eggs. The steak was delicious, albeit petite. The fingerling potatoes were fine, nothing to write home about. But the eggs were not cooked right. If you can't get my scrambled eggs right (I order them scrambled lightly) you're not going to wow me. Especially if you charge me $15 for a diminutive steak and smattering of overdone eggs. I thought all the offerings a tad pricey, which my family attributed to Scottsdale Waterfront real estate prices, but this was the first time I have ever been hungry between brunch and dinner.  Would I go there again? Possibly. I doubt I'd go for brunch. But the raves over dinner make me curious. Maybe they could wow me the second time around.",

Fine, it's my duty to back up such proclamations, isn't it.  Specifics:  First we have an *exquisite* lunch special. You won't hear me saying such things too often, as lunchtime for others is usually my breakfast time. When y'all are scarfing down soup and sandwiches, I'm on my second cup of coffee and a biscotti. But since the day I visited Herb Box it was, in fact, lunchtime, you can trust.  The special I chose (there are several) was the soup/salad/sandwich special, which varies from day to day I believe. On this day it was a potato leek soup, a grilled sandwich with gorgonzola and vegetables and a salad of fresh greens, candied pecans and gorgonzola.  My mouth dropped when it came out, for I expected a small offering of each, but received a large sandwich, a cup of soup and a generous salad.  Vegetarian options? You bet. Several. I wanted to sample things, so I opted for the triple threat plate. Otherwise, if you're looking for something on the lighter side, you cannot go wrong with one of the bountiful salads.  Speaking of healthy and light options, they have deep fried olives stuffed with bleu cheese. And amazing sweet potato chips (I'm not even a fan of sweet potatoes) Heh. Seriously, need I go on about the virtues of such things? Order a salad, splurge on an app. I do it all the time...  But I didn't do it on the day I lunched at Herb Box. Come on, I couldn't! Remember, I don't lunch very often. I tend to treat my work trips as mini vacations, so all intentions of eating light are out the window. And, and...fried olives! I don't even think Rachel Zoe is going to pass up a fried olive.  Herb Box boasts a glorious environs. You feel like you're sitting outside even when you're not. It made me forget, for a few moments, that it was January (perhaps I forgot until my plane landed in snow-ridden Kansas City). They've got the sophisticated, yet relaxed vibe going on, which I noticed is common in Scottsdale. I really love this.  So, I think Herb Box wins as one of the best lunches I've had. Ever! If all places were like this, I'd so be on my way to becoming a Lady Who Lunches instead of a lady who coffees.",

    "text": "I have a confession to make. When I found out that I'd be visiting Scottsdale for work, I secretly thought that the places where we'd be eating and drinking for the week wouldn't hold a candle to my favorite spots in other cities I've visited, like San Francisco, LA, Chicago or NYC. Well, I was wrong and I will happily eat my slice of humble pie, especially if it's from The Herb Box.   The first thing I noticed about the spot was how open and stylish the space was. I loved the old timey bicycle decorating the back wall, I loved the funky upholstery, I loved the classy bathrooms even.   My preconceived notions continued to break down as I perused the menu. For lunch, the offered row after row of amazing options, from fresh made sweet potato chips to a lunch plat du fromage to a whole array of salads and sandwiches. I went with the coconut shrimp salad and when it came out I practically dove head first into the bowl, devouring the ridiculously fresh veiggies and freshly fried shrimp. I think at one point I cried out, \"It feels like a garden is blooming in my mouth!!\" The meal was complete with a nibble of some of those famous sweet potato chips and a gulp of their mango lemonade.   Then why not five stars, you ask? Well, the service was slow. Very slow. They warned us that it might be as we had a large party, but 40 minutes for your dishes to come out just doesn't cut it, I'm sorry. When we asked about the progress our waiter said that it was due to all of our special requests, \"like asking for steak on your salad.\" This confused me, as getting steak on your salad was an option listed on the menu, so it didn't seem so special to me.   Nevertheless, our waiter was a nice guy and I didn't begrudge him too much, or the ktichen staff, especially when the chef/owner checked in on us a couple of times to see how we were doing. Unfortunately for the first time we didn't have much to tell her as we had yet to receive any food.   I think they may have felt bad because they sent out an amazing array of desserts. Everyone loved the cream cheese frosting on the red velvet cupcake but I found the cake very dry and tough. People also loved their dessert which was basically a giant Reese's peanut butter cup. We took their orange cream cupcake to our next destination as a gift and the recipient was one happy lady.   So, while in good conscience I can't give a place five stars when it takes forever for lunch, everyone else had received their food, and we were late to our next appointment because of it, but everything else was on par so I'm going to hope that it was a one-time fluke and give them the props that they deserve!",

    "text": "My girl friends and I visited Herb Box for Saturday Breakfast. Inside the decor is contemporary, bold yet comfortable. We made a reservation for 9:30am and arrived to an empty restaurant. Not that surprising since Scottsdale rarely rises for meals until closer to 11am. Considering we were one of three patrons I expected some over the top service. Not so much. The servers for the other two tables looked prompt, concerned and courteous. Our server seemed pretty stuck up and dismal. Frankly at 9:30am, I'll take my coffee without a side of pretentiousness thank you.   Regardless of our lack luster server or whoever she was, we ordered our breakfast.  I ordered the simple good morning, served with eggs, bacon, white cheddar, avocado, tomato and toast.  It was \"meh\". Not bad, not great. A good option if you are in the mood for a lighter meal without going sideways and too adventurous.   Note to Box: at least ask your table if they want salt and pepper. Never heard of a restaurant without the basic condiments.   I also ordered a cappuccino (pretty good by the way) and mimosa (for $8, go elsewhere in S-dale for the competitors who understand the value of a cheap mimosa even if its not Sunday brunch.)   Overall Herb Box was OK, no real complaints, no real dazzle.",

For shared plates we had the Avocado Love and the Cilantro-lime crab dip.  The Avocado Love comes with a mulitgrain toast under a sea of arugula and avocado. Initially the plantain chips that came with the crab dip were a bit soft, but the waiter promptly and graciously replaced with with crispier ones. The cilantro-lime crab dip itself was impressive. It is entirely pureed with an exquisite combination of flavors that were well-complimented by the plantain chips. The bf had to keep telling me \"you've already said that\" every time I gushed about how much I loved both dishes. The portions of the small plates were actually so large that we almost wanted to cancel our main entree of Baby back ribs. The ribs were so tasty though that I somehow made room for them. They come with a bowl of gouda mac and cheese, with a crumbly top just the way I like it. I wish I had room for dessert since the dessert menu seemed very interesting.  Overall, swanky ambience, with a good crowd of people without being overly loud. I loved everything we had and wanted to explore even more on the menu. Compliments to the chef for a very fresh, creative, delicious menu. This is one of the best dining experiences I've had in a while. Excellent, friendly service. Better to make a reservation if coming on a Friday/Saturday night.",

And the food: WOW, let's just say I wish The Herb Box would open up out here in Los Angeles!  I ordered the crispy falafel balls as an appetizer and the urban market salad as my entree.

I found the wine options a little limited, but they do have beer, cocktails and red and white Sangria.

The bread pudding was decadent with ice cream smothering it. The s'mores creme brulee came with chocolate creme brulee, house-made graham crackers, and dipped marshmallows. It was good but excessive. Definitely a dessert to share.  My recent trip was to try the cronuts (or doissants or whatever) that everyone has been raving about. When I arrived, the bakery case only had one butterscotch cronut left. I asked the employee behind the counter about some of the other pastries (they had a delicious looking blueberry tart) and decided I might as well get the cronut. She told me it was the last one of the day - once they run out they are gone for the day. I took it to go and enjoyed it later that night. (It tasted like a regular donut with cream filling. I don't get what the craze is!)  Overall, the Herb Box is a great place for lunch and desserts. (Either location.) This particular location has become more of a dessert spot for me. I love that they have a large patio for both the restaurant and take-away spot.",

I am gluten & dairy free and usually have very few things to choose from on a menu, or I'm offered a piece of very plain, bland chicken or fish with steamed veggies.  This was not the case at The Herb Box!!  Here is a description of what we enjoyed: crisp brussel sprout chips with a vegan yellow pepper aioli (will definitely recreate at home!!), kale, corn & sweet onion pakora with sweet, hot serrano glaze & vegan aioli, grapefruit and sugar charred salmon with snap peas, fennel, blackberries, pistachios, oranges, charred onions, black quinoa & snow pea shoots and a kobe beef burger for my husband with bacon, brie, apple-jicama-watercress slaw & sweet potato chips, $5 mimosas & bloody marys, and fantastic service to boot! And yes, it was all as good as it sounds...I was in Heaven!!    To find a restaurant that has such spectacular & innovative allergy-friendly dishes is very rare and so appreciated!!  If ever in Scottsdale again, we will definitely return!  I highly recommend The Herb Box for anyone who enjoys delicious food with an innovative twist!  *Don't let the unusualness of the pakora deter you from ordering it!  I was on the fence but took the plunge and could have eaten the whole plate myself easily!!",

My parents had already been to this restaurant so they offered some suggestions.   We started with the Brussel sprouts appetizer. They were cooked perfectly, which some charring and then covered in a light and delicious sauce. These were gone within minutes of them being delivered to our table. I ordered the sweet potato avocado bowl. It comes with quinoa, sweet potatoes, avocado, black beans and more. I added grilled shrimp for some extra protein. The meal was delicious and everything tasted super fresh. My sister ordered the crispy chicken blt, but got the chicken grilled instead of fried. This sandwich came with sweet potato chips that were very delicious. My dad ordered the blackened salmon BLT. I am not a fan of salmon, but he said the sandwich was cooked perfectly and had tons of flavor. His sandwich also came with sweet potato chips. My mom ordered the avocado shrimp salad and loved it. All fresh ingredients and the dressing really added to the flavor of the meal.   Overall this is a wonderful place to have some lunch. Great food, wonderful service and reasonable prices.

    "text": "3 stars because the food is ALWAYS amazing here and the manager tried his best to make up for the awful service. I came in 5 minutes early for my 10:45 reservation and got seated promptly, I put in my drink order and my friend who came at 10:45 put in hers almost immediately as well. This is where it goes down hill.  15 minutes later from my guest siting I still have no drink in front of me. And the table sat next to us waited close to 10 minutes before even being greeted. It wasn't until 30 minutes after being seated that we even put in our order in. We watched as the table next to us got their food RUSHED from the kitchen because they had small kids, a table for 8 come and go, and a table for 2 walk out because they waited to long for their mimosa to come out (another server brought it out 30 minutes later to them not being there, our server even cracked a joke with one table about the wait) Our appetizers came out WITH our entree nearly 50 minutes past the time we sat down, brought out by the manager who acted as our waiter the rest of the time. We finally closed out our tab at 12:25.  We both work in the industry, my friend even used to work at this location, and so we know how some things can fall through the cracks but this being the second time something has come up in the last few visits (forgetting our app and bringing it out at the end of our meal, 2 times ago) something needs to change otherwise I'm scared to see the fate of this location once season hits. Honestly, if the server, had even come over to apologized for things taking so long and updated us on the status of our food, instead of avoiding our table completely once she realized we weren't happy I probably wouldn't even be writing the review.   TL;DR The food is 5 stars, always management is great. Service needs MAJOR HELP",

The restaurant itself is nice and they have a small patio that's pleasant this time of year. I had the chicken-avocado chopped salad. The flavors were nice, but there weren't enough of them. The chicken had a bit of spice and was quite good. There was also supposed to be corn, cheese and bacon, though, and there was hardly any of that. The salad was mostly just lettuce. Overall I am just not impressed with this place and with so many other options close by I probably won't be back.",

    "text": "What a nice place to relax and enjoy some great food with great company. My long time friend came into town and recommended this place, and he is a picky eater so I assumed this place had to be good! It's perfectly located in the heart of downtown Scottsdale by all that's going on so you can run multiple errands if you need to. And what a grand entrance with the stairs, love it lol!  I have passed by this place a few times but have never noticed it, surprisingly, because it's pretty big. It was a decent amount of people in there, not too busy but not dead. The interior is very nice, it has a rustic modern look going on; decor is very important in my opinion! The ladies who served us were pleasant and super helpful! Our main server helped me decide what the best vegan dish was there. I originally wanted the vegan enchiladas but apparently they switch out their menu items once in awhile so it was no longer available. I appreciated her taking the time with me to let me know what was in the dishes she was recommending. She also gave my friend and I suggestions on the best appetizers, so glad she did because the pakora was lovely! I got the lentil cauliflower bowl, it was pretty yummy, I loved the different flavors and the crispy kale was sooo good! I just wish it didn't have a sweet sauce in it.  I wouldn't doubt for a second that I will make another trip to this restaurant. Perfect ambiance, great variety of food for any dietary preference, and great customer service is all I need to make me happy (as I'm sure it would for anyone else)!",

    "text": "Located in downtown Old Scottsdale, this restaurant is really nice. It's a great date night spot with a rustic romantic feel. We were meeting an old friend from HS and it was Valentine's Day so we made reservations. Parking was not an issue because we opted for valet parking. You could park and walk, but honestly it was not expensive to use their valet service. The Herb Box is gluten free and vegan friendly.  We sat outside at a patio table ~ which was great...except for the music. There was a speaker located at the base of a tree across from our table. In the middle of our conversation, this crazy music starts playing. But that wasn't the \"crazy\" part. While that was playing, the restaurant also had a guitarist playing outside ~ at the same time! Talk about craz-y!! It was driving us nuts! Several times I ask our waiter to put one or the other on ~ not both! It was absolutely nutty.  Now to the food...it took FOREVER to get our food! Our waiter kept apologizing profusely for the delay. Had we not enjoyed the company we would have certainly walked out. I ordered the Urban Market Steak Salad ~ It looked amazing when it (finally) came to the table. Mixed greens, arugula, grilled beef tenderloin, ancho-bourbon demi, watercress, avocado, sweet red pepper, sugared pecans, sweet dried corn, gorgonzola cheese ~ and grit. Gross! I also requested no bacon on my salad. It came with bacon. Reluctantly, I asked our waiter to please bring me another salad without the grit and bacon. When it came it was missing a few more of the ingredients ~ no avocado or demi. It still had pieces of bacon but the grit was minimal. Sigh. I also ordered the Citrus Quinoa Salad. Certainly nothing to write about this dish :( The hubster ordered the Kobe Burger. Surprise! When you order a burger for dinner it comes without the bun. Say what?  One would have thought a restaurant like The Herb Box would be prepared for a full house. It was definitely a Valentine's epic fail.",

The four of us had a conversation about how we didn't know if we were eating healthy food or not because it was super flavorful and delicious.   Lastly, we ordered all three desserts they had that day on the menu because they were all so good! the three of them ended up being better than we imagined. Great for adults, children who eat like adults and evenings out. There are not so much of a chicken nugget/fries menu... just a heads up.",

Upon walking in you see a table in the middle with a huge vase of flowers coupled with their really cool hanging lights that had really cool and different Edison bulbs in them (I love those!)   For lunch I ordered the lentil cauliflower bowl which was out of this world! They use the black lentils and rainbow quinoa and it's topped with crispy Brussel Sprout leaves and there's some roasted cauliflower in there as well. The sauce, which was some sort of Dijon aioli was amazing. This thing packed some serious flavor and I can't wait to shove it in my face again haha. It was the perfect after hike meal.",

    "text": "The Herb Box is darling!  With a fantastic location canal-side, it's both romantic and quaint. It's a wonderful spot for brunch, lunch, and a romantic dinner date.   We came with a group of 12 and were seated quickly. The waitress was super attentive and kind and very knowledgeable about the menu - how refreshing!  She recommended a few house favorites including the Butternut Squash & Corn Enchiladas.   I was sold.   Completely Gluten Free, this entree comprised of kale, arugula, avocado, edamame, corn, pickled red onion, pepitas (candied pumpkin seeds) and cheese was a complete winner. SO MUCH FLAVOR! I couldn't believe I was eating something both vegetarian AND Gluten Free. Absolutely try this dish if you're game!   The selection of ice tea was also nice - the blackberry green tea was super refreshing. She even offered us to-go cups after our meal!  I'd definitely make it a point to return to the Herb Box.   PS - Their bathroom is ultra cool!",

Our group got there right when they opened so we beat the lunch crowd.    Our server was fantastic.  She was on the ball with everything, very accommodating, and always checked up on us at the right time.   My group ordered a vegan tray as a starter.  It had brussels sprout chips, edamame, deep fried cauliflower w/ quinoa, and something with kale...I didn't try that one.    I ordered a chicken pesto sandwich.  The server said that's a good sandwich, and she was right!  The piece of chicken was pretty thick, a think layer of pesto with tomatoes, greens, and the best part goat cheese!  The goat cheese was so creamy and really made the sandwich pop!  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.",

The servers are good and know the menu well.  It can be hard to decide what to get because everything on the menu sounds good. You can taste how fresh the ingredients are and the homemade sweet potato chips are great. You can't go wrong with anything you order. The bar could use a couple more beer options, but that isn't really their focus.   We'll be going here again.",

Nice eclectic menu and a good mix of vegan, gluten free, and regular food options, all clearly marked.  I decided to share the Crispy brussels sprout chips which were amazing, and the Kale corn sweet onion pakora, which I also really liked.  It does have some slight spice to it, which was fine for me, but just FYI.  The staff were great and everyone else who ordered entrees loved what they got.  I'd come back here with more of an appetite and enjoy myself all over again.",

We started with the sweet onion, corn and kale pakoras and the gypsy cup soup of the day which was the tomato basil. Cant say I've enjoyed eating kale pakoras before, were crispy and the vegan dip that was paired with it was excellent.  For the main course we shared the butternut squash and corn enchiladas. It came with an arugula, avocado, edamame salad - it was so refreshing! The enchiladas were delicious,  it came with a roasted Fresno pepper that gave it the fiery kick.  Will definitely be back the next time in the area - the staff were all friendly and the restaurant was cutely decorated.",

The menu had a little something for everyone and I felt like you also got a great value on portion, you had plenty of food to feel good but everything was light enough so you could enjoy dessert too. All in all I think this place was fantastic. The star of the night for me was surprisingly the Brussels sprout chip appetizer , I wouldn't think to order this but they were melt-in-your-mouth delicious!! A must try for sure. Our family had a great evening with the great food and service, I would definitely return here again.",

Our waitress was awesome 5 stars for her! She was so attentive and at just the right times. Gave us enough space to enjoy our meal but also checked in when we needed anything. Started with a couple iced coffees and the chilled cilantro lime crab dip served with plantain chips. Which were incredibly delicious! So light and satisfying at the same time. We saved our remaining dip to use as spread for our sandwiches (not wasting any drop of that, that's for sure!) I had the chicken & pesto sandwich which came with bacon, goat cheese, apples and spring mix in between a big ciabatta bun! Definitely no holding back on the serving size either there was enough to take to-go. We will be back again to try more of their menu items, but this place definitely hit the spot for a quick stop before hitting the mall to shop!",

We went for the shared plates and the market short rib tacos and Shrimp in Smoked Jalapeno Rioja Butter are amazing. The latter is on the spicy side, so don't order it if you can't eat a jalapeno. It comes with dipping bread to go into the sauce and I didn't care how unhealthy it may have been. It was good.   The crab dip with fried bananas was good, and the fried green tomatillos were okay. Some were sliced a bit too thick for my liking. But that's not going to stop me. Next time I'm in Scottsdale, you can count on me visiting the Herb Box.",

Now granted it was the middle of a weekday, but the waiter was nice, attentive, and he even gave us directions to a bar we were trying to find (not for that day, but for another time).  I had an amazing cocktail.  It was basically a mojito but used tequila  instead.  Which was perfect.  It took away some of the sweetness of a mojito and gave it a bit more body.    I was there with a family member and we split Asparagus and Fennel Frites and the Butternut Squash Corn Enchiladas.  Both I thought were pretty good.   I really liked the fennel, just because it was something a little bit different.  The enchiladas had a little spice to them but not a ton.  They were very flavorful though.",

It seems like it has a lot of potential but they need to drop their prices and drop the deep fryer. It's a lot of fluff without much substance.  Started with the Asparagus and Fennel Frites - aka, beer battered and greasy hunks of vegetable served in a basket with fake newspaper.  Husband had the trout. Said it was good, and the side was a cheesey asparagus casserole. Came with spinach, which again was fried.  I had the Halibut special. Fish was amazing  with a little tapenade on top but the fingerling potatoes were essentially home fries. No veggies on this entree unless you count the olives.   Server was friendly but I should have known to ask the price on the halibut before ordering it. Atmosphere was sophisticated, but the giant flat screen detracted from what could be a really elegant dining experience.",

    "text": "I made my first visit at The Herb Box by the canal in the Old Town Scottsdale area today. I do miss the old location at Scottsale & Shea, but I can see why they would want to escape that small hidden corner and make itself more accessible and less inconspicuous to the public. The menu is still modern American, light, healthy, and full of flavor. The inside of the restaurant is very pleasant and the staff was very pleasant and welcoming. It differs from the old Scottsdale & Shea location in that it doesn't have a small grocery store area with offerings of their creations prepackaged to purchase and take home with you, but it does have an exterior seating area with more of a patio feel.   During this visit, I decided to go for something I hadn't tried before. For an appetizer, I had the asparagus and fennel frites, which was breaded asparagus with a dipping sauce. Along with the asparagus was extra breading that appeared to be deep-fried. I believe the fennel in this dish was in the dipping sauce. As a main dish, I had the butternut squash corn enchiladas. It consisted of two enchiladas about 5 or 6 inches long and maybe an 1-1/2 inches wide and high. The other three-quarters of my plate was a salad. I loved it. It was very tasty, but it was a little too light for me. It didn't occur to me prior to selecting it that the dish lacked the protein that I so need to feel satiated so I ended up having the other half of my companion's grilled chicken & sage pesto sandwich, which I've had before. My only complaint is the ciabatta bread in the sandwich wasn't toasted enough.   Anyway, the Herb Box deserves high marks for uniqueness in food and the great location. I highly recommend it!",

    "text": "Was taken to the Herb Box for a business lunch and was excited to try it since I had recently read an article on the place.   Was going for the beef short rib enchiladas until I saw the short rib tacos. Asked the waiter and he recommended the tacos so I went for it! They were the tastiest beef tacos I have ever had. The meat was plentiful and full of flavor. There was enough meat to make another taco. The two were plenty. I will not have another taco for awhile as I know I will be disappointed.   Had a few of the sweet potatoes chips and I must say they were also very tasty and not so hard like many of the others that I have had.  Will definitely be back and recommended to a friend who went and she was not disappointed either!",

Highly recommend the sweet potato tacos. It's also one of my go-to places for brunch. They're brunch is pretty popular. I recommend making reservations for brunch, but you can generally get in pretty quick for dinner. They also have a little market where you get delicious food to go.",

Seriously, the food here is something anyone should look forward to in there day. The ambiance is very nice and quaint which adds to a very intimate experience as well.  The wraps here are all works of creativity.  Using fresh and/or organic ingredients making a delightful meal.  There are many wraps to choose from and I think you can't go wrong with any of them.  As and added treat your order includes a side of sweet potato chips...and yes they are wonderful!  This place surely knows what they are doing and without a doubt has a bright future.

    "text": "I was with a group of family members and we initially planned to go to Montagu's, but they were serving only appetizers on Sunday at the time we went (2 pm).  So I found this place nearby on Yelp and we walked there.  We were provided the Sunday brunch menu which had a choice of breakfast or lunch options.  When we first looked at the menu we thought we had made a mistake coming here.  But once we got our food, everything we ended up ordering was absolutely delicious!  Things we ordered:  -Eggs, bacon and toast (my dad is a basic kind of guy)  -Kobe Burger bacon + brie + apple-jicama-watercress slaw + smashed fingerlings + crisp fired sage + smoky blue cheese (My husband ordered this on toasted wheat bread since he doesn't like ciabatta or other fluffy breads. He didn't care for the fingerling potatoes served with it because he prefers regular fries. But the burger was nice and fresh)  -Grapefruit and sugar charred salmon: snap peas + fennel + blackberries + pistachio + orange + charred onion + black quinoa + snow pea shoots  -Lentil cauliflower bowl: organic cauliflower + rainbow quinoa + organic black lentils + pickled red grapes + crispy brussels sprouts + honeycup dijon + aioli   (I know this doesn't sound great, but it was -  I added the grapefruit and sugar charred salmon with it, delicious!)  -Sangria - it was mixed with a drier red wine, with just enough sweetness (my mom and I liked it)  We were only in town for a limited time and I'm glad we decided to come here.  I didn't end up eating another meal for the rest of the day.",

The food was okay. I would say the best item was the mac & cheese. I had the turkey + manchego sandwich which was a whole lot of bread and not a lot of flavor. My counterparts who had the chicken sandwich also complained that the bread to meat ratio was not ideal. The sweet potato chips that came with the meal were a bit tasteless as well.  It is unfortunate because the space is so beautiful. The food + service leave a lot to be desired.",

We chose to sit inside, as it was a bit chilly outside. We got there are the perfect timing, as the happy hour menu was just about to start (at 3 pm). We ordered a ton of stuff off the happy hour menu, as it all sounded so good! We go the korean fried cauliflower, brussel sprout chips, avocado love (essentially avocado toast), mac and cheese, falafel, and the roasted beet and apple salad. For the entrees, we got the enchiladas and the sweet potato tacos. The korean cauliflower and brussel sprout chips were my two favorite from the apps. They were perfectly cooked, flavorful, and unique. I would definitely order these two if I were to go back. The salad was also great and refreshing! I would pass on the mac and cheese and avocado love; the mac and cheese has a smokey flavor, which I'm not a huge fan of, and the avocado love was pretty basic - can get something similar at most other places.   The sweet potato tacos were my absolute FAVORITE from everything we tried that day. I was also stuffed by the time we got them, but my mom insisted that I try a bite - I ended up finishing the entire taco. The sweet potato was so perfectly cooked, there was so much flavor in every bite, and the avocado salsa just perfectly tied the entire dish together. I have been craving these since! The enchiladas were also great! Would order both these dishes again.   The serving sizes are quite small, especially for the price - but a great deal at the happy hour prices. Would recommend going at happy hour so you can try all these delicious dishes at a deal!",

And right now I have visitors every flipping weekend it seems, so I'm always here.    I've never had dinner there, just brunch and lunch and I love both.  For apps, my go choices:  falafel bites, Avacado love, white bean chicken chili (although you can eat this as a meal).    Fav lunch options:  any of the wraps but especially the chicken arugala  or the turkey avocado.  I absolutely love the flatbreads as well.  The brussel sprout flatbread sounds weird, but it works. I mean, it has pancetta on it.  Yum. I also love the black bean chicken and goat cheese.    Recently I had a high maintenance friend in town who suddenly can't eat gluten (bandwagon person) and HB has gluten free options. So there's that as well.

The food here was fantastic, & the atmosphere was very nice.  Brussel Sprout Chips: 4.5/5, I really wasn't thrilled when I saw this on the menu and the group ordered it but I have to say these were absolutely amazing. The yellow pepper aioli was delicious and really brought a lot of extra flavor into this appetizer.  Pear & Gorgonzola Flatbread: 5/5, really nice portion size and really great flavor. This is not something I'd typically order but I have to say it was a blessing getting this dish. Highly recommend.  Blackened Shrimp Baja Bowl: 3/5, the shrimp itself was easily a 5/5 because of the tremendous flavor and seasoning used. But overall the bowl was just eh. Not a whole lot of flavor with the quinoa but everything else was pretty good. I wouldn't get it again but I would recommend the shrimp in something else.  Overall this is a good spot if you're looking for something a little more classy and low key but also want some great food.",

    "text": "Feeding a large group with dietary restrictions is not an easy task, but The Herb Box did A-OK.  We wanted something in Old Town Scottsdale with outdoor/patio dining, healthy options, and a kid-friendly menu.  And Herb Box checked all the boxes!  Our server was sweet and although she was not as attentive as we would have liked, we survived.  The kitchen seemed unusually slow to get food out (staffing issue, perhaps?) or maybe the cooks and/or chef are sloths. When the kids' grilled cheese sandwiches finally came out, we were all pleasantly surprised with how good they were.  The multigrain bread was awesome--tasty, soft, hearty-- it wasn't overly cheesy or dripping with oil, and the flavor was ON. POINT.  I should've ordered one for myself.  The grownups shared: - Korean Fried Cauliflower $13 - Delicious.  We actually ordered a second one since the first one was so good...bold and spicy flavors.   - Cilantro Lime Crab Dip $13 - BIG MISTAKE. HUGE. Tasted like fishy mayo/cream overpowered by lime juice. Pass.  - Crisp Brussels Sprouts Chips $11 - pretty tasty; I like that they weren't greasy at all (how is yhat possible?!), and they were surprisingly super crispy without being charred.   Market Street Short Rib Tacos - $15 -also pretty good; the first order was MUCH better than the second.  Overall, we thought the food was good.  Not sure if I'd come running back but their breakfast sounds good enough to give another whirl.  Love the location and the fact you can try and get a decent meal without ruining your diet!",

    "text": "I came here a few days ago and was shocked to see them advertising their soup of the day by calling it \"gypsy soup.\" I asked my server why it was named that way and it doesn't seem like there was any explanation (no ill will towards my server, who was great, and I'm sure this person didn't name the food or write the menu). That word is a slur against Romani people, who have been and currently are discriminated against across Europe. A couple links to why this is NOT an OK word to use are below (the first is written by an actual Romano person, so please listen to them if you don't listen to me). I'm hopeful that management can change this, because I enjoyed my meal and experience there (and my rating would otherwise be much higher!), but can't endorse a business that uses discriminatory language in their advertising.

    "text": "We arrived & noticed that the restaurant was half empty. We should have taken that as a sign & walked down the street to Citizen Public House. A restaurant in the heart of Old Town that is half empty at 8:30 on a Friday night means something is off, & something was definitely off. I'm not sure whether that something was our server, the kitchen or just generally bad management, but I can truthfully say that this was the worst \"service\" I've received in the little more than a year I've lived in Scottsdale, which is unfortunate because their food is good.   Our server though quite friendly, did herself a great disservice in her failure to be attentive. Had she actually come around in the nearly 40 minutes we waited for our appetizer (that required zero cooking), I would have had 2-3 glasses of wine & my bf 2-3 beers, which would have increased our bill & concomitantly, her tip. Instead, I sat staring longingly at my empty wine glass for at least 25 minutes wondering wtf. Fast forward to the end of our meal; we were only able to beg 2 drinks each off of our server, in 45 minute increments. I expect this sort of service in Europe where drinks don't bring in money for the servers or restaurant, but definitely not in Scottsdale. Regardless, our server received a good tip because we know tips are how she lives. It could have been twice that amount had we seen her during the 100 years of solitude between ordering & receiving our appetizer.   In addition to being ghosted by our server, there was zero thought put into coursing our meal so we could enjoy the appetizer we waited so long for. We expect coursing to be a bit of foreign concept in some lower end restaurants (which we did not view herb box as), but still waited between putting in our appetizer & entree orders so we would not end up with our entrees before, or minutes after our appetizer. Unfortunately, our forethought was futile. Five minutes after we received our appetizer (which as mentioned required zero cooking- mezze board: Greek olives, roasted red pepper hummus, tzatziki & pita), a gentleman who I assume was the manager, was standing in front of us looking bewildered trying to figure out how he was going to place giant entree plates on a tiny two-top that was already engulfed by our mezze board. My kind bf did him a solid and picked up the mezze board so he could set down our entree plates. However, as we (manager & I) stared at my bf with the mezze board practically in his lap, I had to ask the manager to slide over one of the two-tops that were pushed together to make a four top so my bf didn't have to eat one handed while holding our appetizer with the other.   The real kicker is that food was good. If this review was based on food alone, it would be a solid 4 stars. Our order consisted of the mezze board, rosemary buttermilk fried chicken (baby kale, grilled corn & tomato salad, green goddess + cornbread with honey sriracha butter) & thai baby back ribs (green apple-jicama slaw, smoked gouda mac). We enjoyed everything except the cornbread, which had a good flavor, but was very dry & grainy.   Overall, we are hoping this was just an off night & we would be willing to try HB again because we enjoyed our food.   Note-our server took the mezze board off our check because we mentioned the wait, which was not asked for or necessary, but thoughtful. This is the reason for the 3 stars instead of the 2 stars I would have otherwise given.",

The outdoor patio is very nice and heaters outside are nice when it's a little on the cool side.  We were there for Happy Hour and they have some nice $5 plates. We went with Thai BBQ Back ribs on HH menu, Market Street Short Rib Mini tacos (not $5), White Bean Chicken Chili, and Mezze dips (not $5). The Thai BBQ Ribs probably would have been very good on their own, but didn't quite go with the other items we ordered.  The Market Street Short Rib Mini Tacos were delicious and very flavorful. The White Bean Chicken Chili was also very good and something we would both get again. The hummus, tiziki, and olives plate was decent but nothing special. Hummus was good, Tiziki just ok and olives good.   We didn't exactly save room for dinner, but I went for the Short Rib Enchiladas anyways and my wife got the Mac & Cheese as a side.  The Short Rib Enchiladas were tasty and my wife was very happy with the Mac & Cheese.   When we told them we were gluten-free the waitress was very cautious and asked a lot of questions. I always felt well informed on what ingredients were used and what I could and couldn't eat.  Finally both desserts we ordered were gluten-free! We had a Key Lime Cheesecake that was DELICIOUS.  The other was a vegan coconut cupcake with brownie bites. All gluten-free and I didn't have any sort of reaction from the dinner.  We were happy with the dinner but think the desserts were the best part. We'll be back!",

We started with then Brussels Sprouts chips (essentially leaves of the sprouts fried and served with a nice aioli. We had the Burger (juicy and tasty, particularly if you are a fan of one thicker burger, I for one like two thinner patties.). The Short Rib Enchiladas were tasty and like all of the options pretty substantial and served with a tasty Jicama Slaw. The Thai ribs had an addictive sauce and came with really good Gouda Mac. The Pork Loin was stuffed with Kale and Goat Cheese and came with a really large serving of stuffing that was really the only miss of the night.  Despite containing  raisins and pecans, it wasn't all that tasty and was simply too much bread.   The Ruby Slipper drink was really good, not overly sweet but really Grapefruity.  Reasonable wine options went well with the meal.    I would go back, and really want to try brunch.",

My husband and I were having a much-needed date night after a few wild months of business trips, relocating out from out of state, and long long hours at the office. We had plans to see a movie in Scottsdale, so I took advantage of the recommendations for the Herb Box since it was so close to the theater. We're vegans, so finding upscale dinner choices can be more challenging.   We arrived just before 6pm, so we were able to enjoy their fantastic happy hour. I tried the lemon basil martini, which was refreshing and quite strong. My husband did the skinny margarita because he was looking to avoid sugary drinks. He seemed satisfied with it.   We had planned to split the vegan nosh board anyway, but on happy hour you can get all four items in larger portions for just a shade more. The four items were all top notch: crisp edamame pods, brussels sprout chips, kale-corn pakoras (which were more like chips), and korean cauliflower with quinoa. All of it was excellent, but the cauliflower was unreal. Next time, we will double up on the cauli! The brussels sprout chips were really good, too, and unlike something I had before. I like the kale-corn pakoras, although they were difficult to eat. I would not have identified them as pakoras without the menu. The aioli that accompanies them was quite good.  We also split a special salad on the summer menu, which is changing soon, so I'm glad we got it. It didn't seem to have dressing at first, but the server was quick to get us some extra. It was bursting with fresh veggies and lots of quinoa. It was huge, too. We split it and ended up bringing some home.  I regret not having room for dessert because there was a vegan option, which the server said will always be the case on the rotating menu. I guess this just means I have to go back!",

We went for Happy Hour and tried almost everything on the HH food menu.  The food was wonderful, we were all very please with our selections!  In particular, my favorite is the pakora.  The flatbread, Brussels sprouts and cauliflower were all top notch.  Additionally, the cocktails we ordered were AMAZING...ruby red slipper, la la lavender and honey peach smash!  I highly recommend Herb Box for breakfast, lunch, HH and dinner...it is always excellent!!",

I must appease the average, and therefore award 3 stars.  This last weekend I visited The Herb Box for the first time and truly enjoyed the food. I sampled a few different items off of the menu (stole bites from friends) and was impressed with almost everything. My personal favorite was the Brussel Sprout flatbread I had. Very unique and extremely savory. Nobody had any real complaints about the food quality/quantity/taste at our table of 12. Compliments to the chef.  I don't need to bash the service, as there are already plenty of 1-star reviews that take care of that, and I agree with most of them. Quote of the night (40 minutes after we ordered and still hadn't seen food yet)... Friend: \"Excuse me sir, can we place our order\" Waiter: \"You already have ordered\" Friend: \"Oh, that was so long ago, I forgot\"  I genuinely enjoyed the food, and am thankful I had a group of friends with me that helped occupy the time while we waited. I may be back, but I won't expect City Hall attentiveness.",

    "text": "I have always loved both locations of The Herb Box, but after two back-to-back negative customer service experiences at the Old Town location, I am going to have to reconsider.   The first instance was a Friday at lunch time. I had made a reservation (for a party of three) and I checked in at the host stand a few minutes early. I was still waiting for the other two guests so they confirmed my name and reservation and said to just let them know when I wanted to be seated. As I was standing there one of my guests arrived. The other was having trouble finding parking (old town during spring training... yikes), so I walked down to the street to see if I could help her find a spot. My dining companion asked to be seated on the reservation under my name and the host (who might have been the manager and had literally just checked me in) proceeded to ARGUE with her that there was no reservation under my name. So she asked to be seated inside with or without the reservation- mind you, the restaurant was probably only a quarter full. He said fine, but again that I didn't have a reservation. I did, he had checked me in, and why would it even matter at that point, just seat your customer in your nearly empty restaurant! She got seated, we all got inside, then the service was unmemorable and the waitress forgot our drinks.   The next day I was back again for a friend's birthday party brunch. He had called the restaurant to make a reservation for 14. Great, they don't do split checks he was told, so we all made sure to bring cash. The party arrived and we were seated at two different tables of 7, not even next to each other. He was told WHEN HE ARRIVED that they can't accommodate large groups. Completely inexcusable that he wasn't told that when he made the reservation, or that a follow up call wasn't made to clarify the seating arrangement. My friend spoke with a host that day and asked if they could rearrange a couple of the empty tables nearby to fit a few more people (again the restaurant was less than half full), and she was told no, that every single table in the restaurant was reserved. No one was seated at those tables through our entire brunch. It was ridiculous. It is one thing to not be able to accommodate large crowds, but that needs to be made completely known at the time of reservation, and also don't blatantly lie to customers about why you can't go out of your way to insure that they have a good experience. Our waiter was great and attentive, but the food has seriously gone downhill recently. I ordered the same brunch dish I always do (smoked salmon hash), and my over-medium egg was hard as a rock and the dish was not nearly as good as it has been in the past.   I don't know what had happened to this place, but it is really unfortunate. It really was the perfect brunch, lunch, or dinner spot but unless they stop this downward spiral, I won't be going back anytime soon.",

I asked the bartender to order me his favorite lunch menu item so I got the brown sugar pulled pork ciabatta. Great choice! Very great presentation, big portion, and had a very unique blend of ingredients. I like a chef that can think outside the box and bring nontraditional items together in a subtle way. Sweet potato chips were some of the best chips I've had. Great bargain and value for $12....I will be definitely be back to experiment with the rest of their menu!",

Your yogurt parfait is so delectable, that I have visions of swimming in giant pools of your yogurt, rolling around in your homemade granola, and getting drizzled with your orange-blossom honey.  Hmmm. On second thought, that seems a bit sticky.  Perhaps I'd better just return for another weekend brunch.  To be fair, the Herb Box was not our original destination.  We intended to go to another spot... and spied a never-ending line.  Who wants to wait for breakfast when they have a hungry 4-year-old in tow? Not me!  We ventured onwards, and stumbled upon the Herb Box.  No wait?!  On a Saturday morning at 10?  I was a little skeptical that there must be a reason for the slow morning, but hunger won out and we took our seats.    Our table ordered the amazing yogurt parfait, the BLT, and the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes.  Though they were out of their fresh squeezed oj (juicer malfunction?), they were thoughtful and grabbed a bottle of Naked juice from their market for us.  The BLT was something else... crispy pancetta, ricotta, fried egg, arugula, seriously delicious tomatoes, and a spicy aioli, all sandwiched between some of the freshest bread I've ever eaten.  It was just slightly toasted, and all kinds of delicious.  I love when restaurants take a generally boring sandwich and breathe new life into it.  Well done, Herb Box.    The outdoor patio is beautiful and perfect in this Spring weather, so make sure you venture over before it gets too hot out.",

    "text": "We went to the Herb Box to eat lunch over the weekend after doing some par-oozing through old town.  This has been on our list of \"must try places to dine\" after reading so many fellow Yelper reviews.  It was an awesome start with a few drinks listening some fantastic live music on the patio!  Restaurant ~ the patio is the place to eat if available, especially when they have entertainment.  It's a wrap around patio so there are different options to choose from.  The inside is very nice, somewhat of a north eastern coastal design with comfy chairs unless your stuck with one of the plain wooden chairs. (I know these plain chairs provide more balance to the decor but they are they are not comfy!)    Service ~ was very good, not exceptional but good.  They are very attentive to your drinks however they are not as attentive to your meal after it arrives.    Food ~ 5 stars for freshness!  Everything we ordered was extremely fresh from the salads to the veggies.   We order their Flat-bread with smoked BBQ chicken, bacon, Gouda cheese, organic greens, slice cherry tomato and onions.  It was very good.  The greens on top of the flat bread were tossed lightly in oil and were delish!  Everything on the flat bread was very good however it had too many cherry tomato halves, which were picked off half way through.    We also order the gilled Kobe Feta Burger with lots, and I mean lots! of arugula, grilled onion, with a little bit of red pepper aioli with a side of sweet potato chips.  After pulling off some of the arugula so I could see my succulent kobe beef patty we dug in!  This is a very tasty burger but the feta cheese and aioli were very sparse, almost non existent.  We had to ask for more aioli sauce twice.  The sweet potato chips were very delish and became very addictive to everyone at the table.  We should have ordered more...     We also ordered the smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese with bread crumbs.  This was a miss for us since it lacked the creamy cheesy goodness it should of had but rather it was all pasta with some light shavings of gouda cheese and bread crumbs.  It was very bland and we think there was more bread crumbs than cheese...   The Herb Box seems like a very nice place to dine with friends and family, especially on their patio when they have some entertainment.  We plan to come back for more sweet potato chips and to try something else on their menu.  It is A-OK.",

The location is nice as well as it is situated right next to the canal. You can people watch if you decide to sit outside and not worry about the heat because they have the misters.  I think in general, its a great way to start a weekend. Eat your lunch and then finish it off by walking to the mall or through downtown.",

Be aware that the $5 lunch plates are smallish portions, and that even the larger portions weren't big. They appear to be able to manage some allergies- I did fine with a pistachio/cashew allergy even though pistachios are on half the menu items. The waiter was happy to answer my questions about ingredients, including checking with the kitchen when he wasn't sure. They had a few GF items and a few vegan things as well. Overall this was a great place to hang out, if a bit pricey for what you get.",

    "text": "First and last.   Suspecting it may be busy as it is Superbowl week here in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area, I made a reservation for ourselves and two out of town guests (4).  To our surprise (but not really considering the service), the restaurant was practically empty.    When we arrived the hostess barely acknowledged us and she seemed to be rather unhappy to have to take care of us.   We asked to be seated next to the fireplace.    As it stood, a table of 3 had been set up there, and when we made this request, she seemed unwilling or unable to accommodate our request.  Surely it could have been arranged as no one was in the restaurant.  She ended up seating us in a dark corner (the lights overhead had not been turned on) and promptly walked away.  Not saying someone would be with us, a name of the server, etc.  Very poor  At this point I am getting the overwhelming feeling I've made a mistake in choosing this place.   Once seated, we looked over the menu, but could barely read in the dark.   We took it upon ourselves to move tables  (literally there was possibly 8-10 in the entire place so it was pretty easy to move around).    At our new table, we looked over the menu and discussed possibilities...at this point we had been there upwards of 20 minutes and no one had acknowledged us any further.    We decided to walk out....and even still no one even seemed to care that we were leaving, asking if there was a problem, NOTHING.....I was really looking forward to trying this place but now I not return.",

Zero wait at the Herb Box.  Yay!  Already off to a great start.  We grabbed a table indoors (patio was full).  I don't think the AC was on; we were all pretty sweaty in our seats.  I ordered the breakfast burrito with \"laura g's award winning salsa\" and a refreshing fruit salad.  It was good, but I've had better salsas.  Also ordered at our table were the breakfast brisket sandwich (impossibly messy but weighed in favorably with those who tried it), red velvet pancakes (good, but got soggy quickly), granola (A+) and coffees (also good).  And maybe something else I'm forgetting.  It was a successful brunch.  Perhaps a little overpriced, but you get some decent and innovative options to choose from.",

For appetizers, (half off before 6 pm, drinks too) we had short rib tacos, a martini shrimp thing, and the cilantro lime crab dip. The tacos were delicious. The short ribs were done perfectly and the salsa mix was delicious. My friends said the shrimp was great. The dip came with plantain chips which in combo with the dip was apparently, amazing.  For dinner, I had the butternut squash enchiladas. Inside were chopped up pieces of butternut squash, corn, and cotijo cheese. It was served with a big salad. Overall, it was delicious. I had to ask for extra sauce because it was so tasty in combo with each bite of enchilada. My friend also got the enchiladas but wanted meat with it so they added a layer of the short rib meat on top which was great of them and he cleaned his plate. The others got the Thai BBQ ribs and trout. Both were great. Now, I was a bit skeptical of an American place with Thai style BBQ ribs but they did a fairly good job. Were they raditional Thai ribs? No, but good nonetheless.  Sadly, we were all too full to enjoy dessert.",

We sat outside on the patio and it couldn't have been more gorgeous. Nice comfy seats with umbrellas, picturesque, with a bubbling fountain nearby and plenty of greenery.  The food was sublime for the most part. The waiter - super friendly and helpful - recommended the Avocado Love and we ordered two of those. I almost went back the next day just to get it. It was like an amazing salad bruschetta. My BF, a carnivore who makes it a point of not eating anything green, loved it. We also got the crab and cilantro dip. I loved the combination of cheesy crab and citrus and cilantro, though I would have liked the plaintain chips to be a big larger and more substantial (it was hard to pick up the dip with the flimsy scraps of chips). We also got the brisket sliders - looked awesome, the taste was solid but nothing to write home about - and the tacos (I didn't try those). The drinks were also delicious, especially the berry mojito.  If I could have come back for dinner, I would have tried their vegetarian enchiladas. Next time!",

Let's just get right into it.  *I am a server too and I STILL am sooo upset about this experience.   I came with the boyfriend to grab brunch yesterday afternoon because I heard they do amazing red velvet pancakes. We went to the hostess and they were polite, told us it would be a 15 minutes for inside and 20 for outside. We said we'd take first available.   We got seated sooner than expected outside on the patio (which is beautiful by the way; the only reason why this restaurant should even receive any stars). We had some time to look at the menu prior to getting seated so we knew what we wanted. Kristina came by about 5-10 after we had been seated, we ordered water,oj and coffee for the each of us. We also put in the order of the red velvet pancakes and and sriracha fried chicken.   Then we waited....  It took about 5-7 minutes for our drinks. No biggie, she's busy. No sugar caddy for our coffee. We wait to catch her. We don't see her. No biggie, my boyfriend just goes all the way to front of the restaurant to grab some.   Our coffees go empty but it's ok since we ordered OJ as well so we have something else to drink. Our food finally comes; served to us by a different server of course. We have no utensils. Awesome.  The guy who brought our food was so kind to bring us some.  The pancakes were good, nothing that special. Boyfriend's chicken had obviously been sitting at the window forever since his sriracha sauce was dried up on his place and his cole slaw was warm. Whatever we don't complain, it's fine. Up to this point we STILL haven't seen Kristina anywhere.   She finally appears when we're about half way through and asks how the food is, we say it's fine and she disappears again.   We're done with the food and we just want to get out of there now but of course our server is no where to be found. We see another server bussing a table and politely ask if we could get our check from our server since we had been waiting sometime now. This server was so apologetic and mentioned that everyone was quite busy and that she would find our server for us. She finally comes out with the bill; no apologies whatsoever and says \"here you go\"  We give the card right away an then she goes missing again for another 10 minutes.  I've had busy days myself but this server was just awful!!! I'm still so upset about my whole experience and how it ruined my whole afternoon. I'm pretty sure I'll never be back there and if I had Kristina as a server again I would be sure to peace out with a quickness!!!!",

I arrived at 2:35pm on a Sunday and waited ten minutes to be seated. No, not because there was a line but because the hostess was not up front. I received a menu and ordered a glass of wine. When Samatha returned with the wine I was informed, and I quote,\" You know we close in 5 minutes, right?\"   This was somewhat confusing as the brunch menu clearly stated 9am-4pm. Anyway, I quickly made a selection and off she went. My food arrived in quick fashion and was better than I ever imagined eggs, arugula and bacon could taste on toasted white bread.   Had I been asked I would have been interested in enjoying another glass of the riesling. That, or a first glass of water, but as there was no one to ask I finished my food sans beverage. After reading through a chunk of a guidebook I got tired of waiting so I ventured inside. While inside I decided to stop at the restroom. I waited a few minutes for a powder room to open up. When I came out Samantha was outside waiting with my check. Funny how that works.   Disappointing as the venue is in a wonderful location and the food is stellar.",

When her luggage then got delayed, I called to tell them we were going to be even later than planned yet again, and the lady informed me that she would most definitely hold onto the table for us no problem. We got the brussel sprout chips with vegan aioli and they were BOMB! I had a roasted cauliflower/quinoa/lentil dish that was stellar (had pickled grapes in it..yum!). The food was tasty, presented lovely, and the staff was helpful and efficient. Outside patio area was lovely. All around, another great meal at Herb Box. This is always my go to for nicer dinners, anniversary dates, etc. Highly recommend. They hit a home run with this place.",

He knew nothing about the menu and had no social skills or serving skills. He said he'd never even eaten anything on the menu... then when we got the check he stood by our table and stared at the bill waiting for his tip. Would not go back... I'm actually really confused why there are any good ratings for this restaurant. The only good things were the drinks and the ambience. If you go for brunch, look out for the middle aged socially awkward guy with black hair, HE SUCKS as a server. I worked in the service industry for a very reputable restaurant and he was the opposite of what a server is supposed to be. So disappointed.",

Sat outside, ordered some apps and waited, waited, waited, oh did I mention waited for our waitress to come back to take our lunch order? It was horrible!!!!   We waited so long for her to take our order that when we did get our food, I asked for the bill and a to-go box. Oddly enough, when we were done eating, she brought us the bill and box- again, confirming how long you must wait.  The food was good. Tasted fresh but what really ruined lunch for us was the blonde waitress we had. She needs to learn to smile and actually WORK for her tip. Felt like she was doing us a favor by bringing us our food.   I called my husband and I told him that though I enjoyed my company, I very much disliked the service.  I will not be back.",

    "text": "This is a cool restaurant that reminds me of an Amish restaurant I went to years ago.  Kind of country design, large wooden furniture.  Its nice, but slightly crowded (I don't like it when you hit the chair of the person behind you when you pull out the chair a bit to get out.  The way the furniture is designed you have to pull it out quite a ways to free a limb, even if you're petite.)    The sandwiches are made with good ingredients.  They are assembled with care and the combinations are great.  The side of sweet potato chips that come with the sandwiches are crisp and salty.  A few were soggy, but it happens.  So why the low rating?  Severely overpriced.  They don't seem to be hurting for business though so maybe priced appropriately for them?  However, unless you want to pay 13 for a sandwich, just go to Paradise Bakery (I'm not a huge fan of them either but they also make a decent sandwich for 5 dollars less).    I may go back for hh - their beer and wine selection seems good and well priced between 3-6 and half price shared plates (appetizers).",

It can get a little crowded in the bar area up front.    The decor of this place is trendy/classy.  Looks like they took a bunch of props from Anthropologie and threw them in the restaurant and somehow managed to pull of a great rustic yet elegant look.  Go see for yourself!  There was also a live act playing that night - everything from Clapton to Christmas music and while it was great, sometimes it was hard to hear/talk over the music.  Service was great as well - our waitress was able to get us out the door in an hour and a half and that was with check splitting and multiple recurring drink orders!  Now for the food... I was able to try the sliders, thai bbq ribs w/ mac n cheese, and the capicola ham flatbread.  All of it was delicious.  The meat just falls right off the bone on the ribs, and the sauce was fantastic.  Most things are in the 16 - 30 price range.    A+!",

    "text": "My BFF and I had been wanting to eat here so we decided to stop in for lunch after a dress fitting at Destiny's Bride across the way.  This place is super cute inside (even the bathrooms were impressive), the perfect atmosphere for a ladies lunch.  We were immediately seated and our drink order was taken. However, I was a little disappointed at how long it took the server to visit our table again. I made eye contact with him and managed to say \"come on man,we're ready to order\" without using any words at all. He acknowledged me and explained that he would be right over (I think he was carrying a tray of drinks for another table at the time). While he offered to share the specials (which I had been very interested in hearing about when we first sat down), my friend and I had both settled on a choice from the regular menu and were ready to get the show on the road.  I ordered the butternut squash enchiladas. The server had mentioned that it was one of the best things on the menu, but if that's the case -- bummer. My thoughts? The squash was undercooked, the tomatillo sauce was delicious but lukewarm at best (as was the filling). The mixed greens on the plate were sprinkled  with cotija cheese and dressed with some multicolored bell peppers, fresh and delicious. Maybe I should've ordered a salad instead?  BFF got the grilled chicken and sage pesto sandwich.Of course I had a bite... DELICIOUS! She was expecting the chicken to be warm; it was cold, but still a tasty sandwich. I'm pretty sure it was on ciabatta bread (love it) and was dressed with goat cheese, gala apples, and bacon. YUM! It came with sweet potato chips too and I couldn't keep myself from stealing another and another from her plate. I would definitely order this next time.   The server was always friendly, but I get the feeling that maybe he was taking care of too many tables at once. I've seen other comments on yelp addressing the service so perhaps this is an issue that needs to be addressed (ATTN: Management). I was, however, impressed that the server noticed a birthday gift sitting on our table and offered to bring a birthday treat. It was a chocolate cupcake with white frosting and a chocolate shell on top. DELICIOUS!! Reminded me of a chocolate hostess cupcake (I'm a sucker for those things).   Overall impressions? Cute. Pricey. So-so service.. Hit or miss food. I might try it again...still thinking about it.",

The salmon plate was good, but again, not worthy of the cost, or a sexier adjective than simply \"good.\" In general, I don't think The Herb Box lives up to its prices.  However, it has a few exceptions. The falafel appetizer was absolutely magnificent. Who the hell uses  \"magnificent\" to describe a fried chickpea ball? Just try it, you'll understand. They also have $6 salads that are big enough to be a light meal. The one that caught my eye had avocado and candied pecans in it...  and bacon and blue cheese dressing. I swapped out the animal products for another salad's toppings: lemon poppy seed vinaigrette and dried corn. I would order that made up salad again in a heartbeat, and more importantly, I'd pay for it.  I'm still skeptical of the price tags, but after this visit, I must admit: my interest is piqued. Herb Box, I shall return. But not for dinner. Because I'm usually kind of broke.  Lunch or brunch. Probably lunch. Yeah.

They have a lot of vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and other nutty (or nut-free) dietary choices, but that doesn't phase me. I'm a devoted carnivore, but will happily eat a vegetarian dish if it is well done. And The Herb Box does them well.

I suppose a little snootiness is sometimes to be expected in this part of town. But at least it's civil, lol.

And then use it for myself so I can be cute and trendy, too!  The food here is really fantastic. I had a gargantuan salad that could have easily fed 2 I bet. It was a great blend of flavors. And of course, Gabi convinced me to start with the sweet potato chips. Those were good, too, but nothing compares to Sputnik's sweet potato fries so far. Everything seemed worth trying though so I wish I could have gone back again and again.  Our server was super nice and extremely friendly. Overall, it was a great experience!",

    "text": "My mom and I decided we wanted to eat somewhere healthy after taking a grueling gym class...only made sense. She had heard that this place only used \"Farm Fresh\" food, so I checked Yelp. Sure enough almost everyone seemed to like the quality.   The inside is cute in my opinion- cute booths, couch chairs, bike art, a bar, and outdoor seating. The servers were super friendly and helpful, but I must admit they took forever to serve us our food. It's definitely the kind of place that you need to order drinks first to better deal with the long waiting period.   The food definitely deserved a full 5 stars (but the wait knocked my review down to 4.5).  After many Yelpers raved about the Butternut Squash and Corn Enchiladas, I decided to order that. OMG sooo good! I'm honestly going to say that it was one of the best dinner dishes I've ordered in a while. It also came with a large portion of salad that had a tasty vinaigrette on it. The green sauce on the enchilada was especially good, but there was some super spicy element I couldn't quite put my finger on. Oh well, a little burn is good once in awhile right? We also ordered the Smoked Trout Beignets with at Red Pepper Aioli, which were amazing. I wish it came with about 10 more on the plate haha. My mom wasn't very hungry and just ordered the Balsamic Tangerine Beets (which were super good), and the Chickpeas w/ Red Quinoa.   Next time I get a chance to come here, I want to indulge in their tapas style cheese menu and order some of their delicious looking cocktails...and sit outside if it's not 108 degrees? All in all, a winner in my book!",

    "text": "Thanks to Yelp reviews, my hubby and I learned about the Herb Box in advance of our visit to Scottsdale earlier this month and had lunch there one day before visiting the Desert Botanical Garden.  We both loved the Herb Box, although at first my hubby was concerned that he was the only guy except for our remarkably good and friendly server, Christopher, among a sea of \"ladies who lunch\".  We arrived early, about 11:30 and as there was only one other person in the (Shea) Herb Box we seated ourselves at a four top right by the window.  Christopher, who knew what was to follow that we did not which was a nearly full house by 12:10, could have asked us to move to a two top but he didn't.   We apologized to him later as the crowds started to arrive for taking up a table for four and said next time we'd know better.  But he was most gracious saying something like \"no worries, you probably made my job easier\".  Indicative of the friendly service he delivered throughout the meal.  We split an order of remarkably good enchiladas that were filled with butternut squash and corn and cheese (queso anejo) and served with a perfectly spicy tomatillo sauce.  Along with a side order of yummy apple, frisee slaw that included little cubes of swiss cheese, cranberries (or was it pomegranate seeds that day?) and cashew pieces, it was a delightful meal.    We didn't have a means to keep take out cool in our warm car while we went to the Garden or we would have taken out dessert for later as well as other savory dishes for dinner at the resort villa unit where we were staying.  Next time we're in Scottsdale we'll arrange it so we can enjoy several more meals from The Herb Box as there were many items on the menu and being served to the tables around us that looked great!  Note for the wheelchair accessible listing that shows on the Yelp review page, the eating space is accessible through one of the entry doors, but we're very aware of accessibility these days and  if you use a wheelchair be prepared that the bathroom is not accessible.",

But really, you can put potatoes in anything and I'll like it.  Today, I had lunch at The Herb Box, and was pleasantly surprised with their fish taco special. Seriously, I didn't expect tacos this good at a place with such varied food styles as The Herb Box.   What keeps me from giving The Herb Box that final star are the prices and service. The food is good, but just a few bucks more than what I usually want to spend. The service isn't awful, but it has that slightly snobbish Scottsdale vibe. Little things like that make me want to stay in Central Phoenix and out of downtown Scottsdale.",

We got a seat on the patio and told our waiter we were planning on \"grazing\" our way for a bit- he was super nice and came back to check on us, only when plates were empty.  First the edamame hummus; why have I never thought of this before? Ahhhmazing. Planning making this at home- garnished with corn ask raddishes, just the right amount of fresh. We also had the pesto pizza, fried cauliflower, and drinks of course. Blackberry margarita for me, house special for him- blackberrys were fresh and tasted light without being too sweet!   Everything was clearly fresh and seasoned exceptionally. The vibe of the restaurant was also awesome- definitely recommend for a boozy lunch or an afternoon with time to kill!",

We waited long for our drinks to come out in the beginning we also wanted to order a second round but by the time she came back we we're already done eating. One of us ordered a bottle of wine and that took longer than the drinks from the bar. We originally ordered 3 appetizers the other being the edamame but they we're out. Which wasn't a big deal. It took a while for the waitress to come back after our second drinks. The manager came out to apologise for the wait and that the edamame was accidentally on the bill and will be removed and it will be a little longer. We waited but only to have them still on there. She apologized and returned with the new bill. We didn't look twice and it wasn't until we we're home that we realized we were still charged. It's not even the money that's a big deal but the principle. I don't know and we were pretty patient at this place consider the service. I'd recommend but kinda hard to.",

Just basic customer service and attentive nature is lacking here. Normally I don't leave reviews online for the public to see. But I felt it was needed with this place, since we encountered the manager during the visit and that was also quite mind-blowing.   The place is incredibly cute; great location and awesome atmosphere. However, this is where the good ends. The hostess literally ignored us standing outside by the desk, while she figured out the party set up before us. It's ok if you need to take time for someone else and their needs; we get it! But don't ignore us, avoid eye contact, and not even say hi! Let us know you'll be right with us. The most laughable is then two other people (1 the manager and another server) came over to hostess stand and just checked computer screen. No greeting of any sort. While standing there, we found out that they had also ignored another woman waiting for a table too.   After finally being helped inside to our table, I believed we would walk into an incredibly busy and packed place due to the lack of service. We didn't. There were 3 other tables sat inside. We forgave the first part of our experience and were ready to have a great brunch. However, the server took about 15 min to approach us after they all figured out who would be taking our section.   We ordered the Bloody Mary bar and mimosa. Unfortunately, this was not well done either. I asked the manager who came over to the bar if there were tongs to use for the veggies, or if I should pick them up with my fingers. His response was \"Right?!\" No action was taken after, so I just made a Bloody Mary for myself.   Food was 50%. Their salmon hash is pretty good! I would recommend that. Their Avocado toast is pretty awful in my opinion. Someone might like it though.   To sum this up... very bad experience. I would never recommend or return to this place. I urge you to use your money elsewhere.",

I loved her decoration in the women's toilet so much I included a photo.   By waitress recommendation Our group ordered the Korean Cauliflower w/ quinoa  (it was interesting). Then we had the pear and Gorgonzola flatbread.  It was ok.   The Chilequiles was something I'd recommend. This was a hearty meal that if you ordered any starters you could share this cause it's filling.   I like to add a kick to my food so the busboy brought the tabasco sauce. When I did a shake, someone took out the top portion to control the flow of tabasco so my food was douced with tabasco sauce.   I actually didn't mind however, something didn't agree with my tummy so I had to use the restroom.  I have a feeling it could have been the tabasco sauce.   Anyway, my son loved the steak and eggs.   Overall I would give a Yay to try the Herb Box.",

    "text": "Cute restaurant at a great location with fresh local ingredients. The dinner menu has a good selections. It took us awhile to decide since everything look delicious. We decided on kale, corn & sweet onion pakora, Thai BBQ baby back ribs and burger. The pakora was sooooo frigging delicious. The flavor is spot on and the kale is crispy. My husband doesn't usually like kale and he almost licked the plate clean. According to our waiter, the pakora is one of the top three appetizers. The ribs are good and it comes with a side of smoked Gouda Mac & cheese...yummm! The burger was paired with green apple jicama slaw, bacon and Brie- the combination is just perfect! We were stuffed by the end of our meal and we had leftovers. However, we decided to check out the dessert menu. Our waiter recommended the crack pie which is an oatmeal cookie crust with butterscotch sauce with whipped cream on top. The crack pie was delish and we totally devoured the pie. It was surprisingly lighter than it sound and it's the perfect amount of sweetness.",

Cute place, but service was off and food was \"fine.\" We ordered the chicken sandwich, avocado toast, a salad and the squash enchiladas. The only thing that stood out to any of us were the sweet potato chips that came with the sandwich. They were great.   We actually commented that we were glad we were not working that day...lunch took almost 2 hours. Maybe just a bad day???  Ironically, we headed to the coffee shop downstairs and had a totally different experience...that was awesome. Coffee, sweets and service could not have been better.   Skip the restaurant upstairs and go for coffee and dessert at the cafe.",

We had to ask for silverware and napkins. They forgot my son's entire meal altogether. My husband's sweet potato chips were inedible- soggy and oily. My steak with my salad was ordered MR and came out MW and tough. Then after we finished, the server forgot about us after clearing one plate and came back after 15-20 minutes and another table had hunted her down for their check. There were 4 other tables  in the restaurant- no excuse for this awfulness. Horrible experience.",

I love their outdoor patio, cute lights, and the fact that there is usually a live musician right there by the canal so if you sit outside you can listen to the live music.  Every time I have been here I have had some tasty, quality drinks. I love their wine selection, a nice glass of white wine or prosecco while sitting outside truly can't be beat at this place.   Now, let me tell you about their flatbread. First off, on Happy Hour, it is a TOTAL steal. You have to try it! It is bursting with flavor and has just the amount of toppings to match texture with taste.   Now, if you have some veg-friends, they have a GREAT vegetarian nosh board. It is perfect for grabbing a few glasses of wine and munching while enjoying the beautiful location.   I recommend this for a date-night spot!",

    "text": "I've been coming to Herb Box for years, but my last dinner there was a horrible experience. I arrived a few minutes before the rest of our party of 7, checked in with the hostess but decided to wait while the rest of the party arrived. We had requested the patio, and even spoken to the restaurant during the day to confirm, since it was a nice night and we were celebrating a birthday. Another party of 7 arrived shortly after me and complained that they weren't on the patio. Once more of my party showed up, we decided to be seated and what do you know, we've been seated inside and the other party was seated outside. It was incredibly rude, but we decided to go with the flow and make the best of it.  Once seated, it was immediately evident the service would be poor. We ordered a bottle of wine that took 15-20 minutes to receive. The server poured a sip to taste and then walked away before my friend could give him the \"tastes great\" nod. When he returned a few minutes later it was as if he wasn't going to pour the rest of our table a glass of wine until we passed our glasses down to him. After we finished the first, we ordered another which took another 15 minutes before we received a single glass. We corrected the order, but then again it took far too long to receive the bottle.   Throughout the 2 1/2 hour dinner, service was slow, the restaurant was out of 3 different things we wanted, plates were not cleared, and 3 empty wine bottles sat on our table at the end of the night. When we received our check, the table was still not cleared. Inside, there were at least 5 empty tables throughout the time we were there so it's not as if it was just a busy night. For a restaurant like this one, I would expect much better service. When this was all mentioned to the manager, she was only slightly apologetic, but took off 3 appetizers.   The whole night left such a bad taste in my mouth that it's unlikely I'll return. I was chatting with my sister after the dinner, and she mentioned having a similar experience the last time she was there. Such a bummer to hear!",

Their choices for restaurants are usually spot on though I must say The HERB BOX was a huge disappointment.  Being apart of The Slow Food movement I expected more.  The only thing SLOW was the service and smiles.  In a shopping center where stores are closing down left and right a smile can go a long way.  Instead we were ignored by the hostess who finally when deciding to realize that we were waiting for a table excused herself to locate us a place to sit on the patio.    Mind you it was a Saturday and the patio was empty (sign of the times, or the food and service?).  She then returned 10 minutes later surprised to see us  still waiting for a table.  Her attitude towards us because of having young children with us was appalling.  It's a Cafe/Bistro not a 3 star Michelin restaurant that only serves dinner!  My 4 year olds manners are better than hers are.  The food was also nothing exceptional, panini shouldn't take 30 minutes when there are no other people at the restaurant except wannabe socialites sitting at the bar patio side.  I would definitely not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  What a shame!!!  The HERB BOX will probably be the next store to close down in the DC Ranch Market street shopping center.",

Anyone who has had surgery knows just HOW wonderful this is! This week, I wanted to try the hummus appetizer but it comes with pita. Eric had the kitchen cut up all kinds of beautiful veggies in place of the pita. It was soooo good. He has made other changes for me too! I now request only him.

    "text": "I ate brunch there last Sunday. I had the red velvet pancakes.  Yumm!!!  The food, the waiter, the atmosphere and even the bathroom decor was 100% what a sunny, mimosa-filled brunch day in Scottsdale should be.    It was truly difficult to choose only one meal because the menu is fabulous.  They have a mimosa deal that if you get an entre and the mimosa deal, it's about $20 or so and it's as many mimosas you can drink.  They had four flavors: original (oj), grapefruit juice, cranberry and mango.  Their mimosas are mostly champagne, which made me extra happy!  The waiter was very attentive and thoughtful despite the place being very busy.  And he, like many who work there, was easy on the eyes.  The bathroom looks like something out of Alice in Wonderland or Regina's office on Once Upon a Time, i.e., black, white and mirrors.  Very nice/ elegant, although I was confused when I thought the wall was moving (just a mirrored door) to the stall.  There was some good people watching going on that day.  I apparently didn't get the memo that it was pink day.  Lots of people wearing pink, even men in golf-style pink shirts.  A lot of the women looked over processed, but it's Scottsdale, so what do you expect?  It's fun to watch the scene.  I would highly recommend this place to others.  The only down side is that I called and made a reservation ahead of time and they had no record of it, despite a 5 minute conversation to set up the reservation.  They still accommodated my part, however.",

    "text": "Herb Box tops my list for one of my favorite locations for lunchtime or dinnertime dining, but just recently I experienced Sunday brunch here for the first time. This is definitely a reasonably priced Sunday brunch option. In fact, it's the same price as it is any other time during the week, but on Sunday, in addition to several lunch items, they also offer breakfast options such as Cinnamon pancakes, Market BLTs, breakfast flat breads, goat cheese omelets. While sitting out on the patio and enjoying the breezy late morning environment (they open at 11 on Sundays), I enjoyed the Market BLT which was a fried egg topped with pancetta, ricotta and served on brioche. I only ate about half of the bread it was served on because it was such a large portion, but the meal was pretty good. I would have liked it to come with some fruit but I'll know to ask for that next time. I noticed a dog sitting on the patio, which made me wonder if they have a dog friendly patio. I will look into this and report back because I know a certain cockapoo in my life named Harley who would have enjoyed this morning meal as well!",

It's sort of this rustic yet contemporary Cape Cod look and the bathrooms are the best in the city! The service was perfect and the food-- even better. I got the trout with fried spinach and some sort of cheesy vegetable side dish that was amazing. My boyfriend got the spare ribs with mac and cheese. It was equally as good. On and the desert! The trio is a perfect way to end the meal and everything was so good. This is the perfect date night location.",

The restaurant looks killer, totally high style and I'd be happy to eat there, too.  I saw a burger go by that I'm pretty sure winked at me and gave me a come-hither.  Next time...",

We were there through sundown and into the evening and the view is just beautiful.  Two of us commented, at the same time, that we felt like we were at Disneyland.  Our server, Madeline, was great.  She knew the menu and was very helpful in accommodating dietary needs with alternative suggestions.  Two of us had the Goat Cheese Free Range Chicken, (Note, the chicken is on the bone which I personally do not care for), one with the risotto cakes and one with quinoa.  I loved the cakes but I did overhear another table who indicated they did not like the breading.  Neither of us cared for the grilled Belgian endive that came with our dinner so that was a waste.  Our third party member ordered Pear & Gorgonzola Flatbread and added chicken.  It was a little too oily for her as she has digestive issues but she did say the flavor was great.  Will definitely be returning.",

The couple seated at the table next to us gave up and left and just as my husband started our countdown to departure (\"10, 9, 8...\") our server showed up. We had to ask numerous times for coffee refills (which the server said they were brewing - how does a restaurant keep running out of coffee??).

Read on if you want details on the pre-pre-Wedding celebration we had at our house last Thursday night.  I always knew that when the time was right, I'd have the Herb Box cater a party for me... and the time finally came.  We had about 40 people over at our house on the Thursday night before our wedding.  It was primarily our friends that flew in from out of town early and we really wanted to entertain.  So I reached out to Robert, Director of Catering, and explained what we were thinking about.    He responded in no time at all and he was extremely professional as we went back and forth a few times on pricing, menu, etc... the outcome was perfect.  We had a buffet style dinner including a chef and two buffet attendants.  Robert and Mary came over to the house a few days before to do a walk-through, and go over details.    On the day of our event, the team came early and went above and beyond, even running to the store for us to pick up lemons and limes.  I know you're dying to know what our menu was, aren't you?  Okay - I'll share!  Here you go: -Urban Market Salad with watercress, red pepper, dried corn, sugared pecans, avocado, and blue cheese vinaigrette (dressing on the side) -Citrus & Rum Free-Range Chicken with watercress, pear-gorgonzola salsa -Alaskan Salmon with maple-ginger glaze -Asparagus couscous with feta and mint -Grilled vegetable feast with farmers goat cheese and herbs -and of course my favorite, the Signature Sweet Potato Chips dusted with mild curry  We arrived at the above menu after looking through around eight pages worth of gourmet menu items that are all appealing possibilities if you choose to use the Herb Box to cater your event.  They worked within our budget and made it quite an evening to remember.  I highly recommend using The Herb Box whether you're catering a party for 12 or 100+.  Just trust me on one thing - make sure you get those sweet potato chips!",

We saw a large sign that said \"Herb Box\" up some stairs, with an inviting door, so we ventured inside.  Upon entering, we were confused because we couldn't see a check in area.  Eventually, the hostess came by, gave us a dirty look, and said tersely \"You didn't enter the right way.  This is the back way\".  We were shown to a table after she bitchily asked us how many people we wanted a table for, but I was miffed that she was so annoyed at the fact we accidentally went in through the wrong entrance.  Looking at the sign when we left, there wasn't any indication that it was the back entrance, nor were there any instructions to enter through the front.  How were we supposed to know it wasn't the right way to enter?  Maybe they should put up a sign or some indication that this isn't the correct entrance (or lock the back door), wouldn't that clarify things a bit? (Or maybe the hostess shouldn't be so bitchy to customers?  Just a thought.)  Despite being treated rudely by the hostess, our server was very friendly.  The red velvet pancakes were moist, chocolatey, and covered with a mild tasting mascarpone cheese.  The Gran Marnier sauce was delicious, and I could definitely taste the liquor in it!  I tried some of the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes, which were also very good.  The pancakes were very filling and a good portion size; I could only finish half of them because I got full halfway through my meal.  In general, despite getting the cold shoulder initially, it was an enjoyable meal.  Since there are a plethora of breakfast places around this area though, I'd like to try some other restaurants here before maybe venturing to Herb Box again.",

    "text": "A couple weeks back I drove down to AZ to visit my pledge sister from my college sorority days.  She has been on a quest to find some of the best restaurants in AZ before she moves back home at the end of the school year. The Herb Box popped onto her list after yelping and hearing other talk about it.  She didn't have to twist my arm to go here for Sunday Brunch, especially when she mentioned Red Velvet Pancakes (funny thing is I didn't even order them once I saw their yummy menu)  My other friend and I decided to share two dishes, because it isn't every day that we find ourselves in Arizona and there were just too many things to choose just one.  We decided one sweet and one savory to be well balanced!  For the sweet: Cinnamon buckwheat pancakes (9) served with wild blueberries and strawberries, smoked applewood bacon, and whipped honey butter.  I am definitely a fan!  As intrigued as I was by the Red Velvet Pancakes, I'm happy that my friend went with these pancakes instead.  They were the perfect balance of sweet and not too sweet.  Also the buckwheat made me feel like I was being a little healthier without it tasting healthier.  Now I'm not a bacon fan, (*gasp* yes not everyone loves bacon) but everyone else who does like bacon loved theirs.  For the savory: I picked the smoked salmon hash (14) that came with crisp fingerlings, pancetta bacon, scallions, fried capers, aioli, and soft egg.  I know, that I just said I didn't like bacon but I picked a dish with pancetta bacon...but I love smoked salmon so I couldn't resist.  I could definitely taste the bacon but I thought it went well with everything else so I didn't mind.  I really enjoyed this dish and if you likely hearty salty goodness in the morning or for brunch would recommend trying this out  Not only was the food great their decor was also really fun and stylish.  There was several vintage pieces with a twist that gave it a very modern feel.  Also their bathrooms had some of the most interesting sinks that I'm having a hard time describing ...I wish I took a picture.  Overall, a great find by my friend.  If I lived in Scottsdale, I would go back without a doubt.",

    "text": "I've been here several times for business lunches and find that they have reliably good food and service.  It is not unusually pricey for downtown Scottsdale with $13-$15 salads. I love the Market Sunflower with berries, goat cheese and blackened chicken and the Steak Salad with cooked-to-order meat, corn, peppers and blue cheese vinaigrette, . Both have lots of yummy ingredients and have really great flavor.  Portions are nice size and have a good serving of protein. The patio is pleasant on the \"waterfront\" (it's a canal, but in the desert we all pretend its a river), as is the dining room.",

Sat at the bar, since it was a Friday and I guess that's where people sit.  Went with Kirti for happy hour & just to chill.  Not only was the service great (I rarely had to ask for a refill), but the chef even came out to introduce herself.  The place wasn't too crowded yet, which was good, because that's another reason for all the attention.  Had to keep the worker bees busy!   First thing we tried was the ribs appetizer.  They were falling off the bone and had an amazingly sticky-spicy-sweet sauce on them.  Also had the crab dip, which came with plantain chips.  I loooooooooove plantain chips.  Love.   The pork tacos?  OMG.  O. M. G.  I took a couple home as leftovers and my mouth watered all night, thinking about those tacos. For dessert, we had \"crack pie.\"  I don't even know what was in it, but the crust was nutty, there was whipped cream, and it stuck to my teeth when I ate it.  And it was made from crack.  It HAD to be!!!!!!  The red velvet cupcake was also divine, but that crack pie...*sigh* Parking is a bitch in Old Town, but there is a garage right near The Herb Box.",

    "text": "After trying the DC Ranch location for dinner, my co-workers were ticked I hadn't invited them along. To make amends, I offered to pick up lunch from the Shea location. Anne ordered the Ahi sandwich special, blackened with a TON of seasoning... she absolutely loved it. I ordered the Smoked Turkey chiabatta that had a great smokey flavor between the turkey and the bacon, but was lacking much of the red-pepper aoli and completely missing the gouda that read on the menu. We were disappointed that the plantain chips promised with the special turned out to be sweet-potato chips, but they were tasty all the same.   Poor Sonya ordered the beef tacos that sounded wonderful, but came to fruition as 2 bite-sized soft tacos with no side. And I quote \"for 14 bucks, you'd think they could throw in a cup of beans or something!\" I had to agree, and gave her my sweet-potato chips. I think we all finished a little unsatisfied. Just as with the other location, all-in-all it's great flavors and good ingredients, but trying way too hard (and charging for it)!",

The ambiance was amazing, the waiter was very professional and friendly, and the food was amazing. I got the special $25 for unlimited mimosas (delicious), an entree, and a delicious appetizer. I got the red velvet pancakes, which I HIGHLY recommend. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I was really, really looking forward to Sunday brunch at the Herb Box, as I have heard rave reviews! I have also walked past it many times on the waterfront, and have enjoyed the live music I've heard, as well the chic look of the place. I'm a definite foodie, and the menu looked great, so I was stoked to try it!  Well, I'm not sure if the restaurant was having an \"off\" day or what, but our experience at the Herb Box today was terrible, from beginning to end. :-(  Maybe it's all part of some restaurant \"rudeness\" kitsch that I am unaware of, but I really hate to say that the service was pretty awful--the hostesses were snobby and unfriendly, and the wait staff was very inattentive. I accidentally spilled a glass of ice water on my lap as our server handed it to me, and he just left the table without a word, and without offering or bringing back any napkins. Lucky for us it was 90 degrees out and it all dried fast! :-)   And then the food. Ugh. Really disappointing, especially for the price. I ordered a strawberry lassie to drink with a Market BLT, based on Yelp recommendations.  The lassie was literally curdled and undrinkable, and the BLT had absolutely no bacon/pancetta on it. My husband ordered the Smoked Salmon Hash, which promised an impressive array of fresh ingredients and flavors, but in actuality looked and tasted like canned fish mixed with fried potato chunks. Awful, awful.  I don't like to complain about food while sitting at a table, and I never send anything back. In this case, I really wish I had been able to, but we only saw our server twice--once when he took our order and again when he brought the check. He did not deliver our food and no one ever refilled our drinks. At that point, we just wanted to get out of there, so after 90 minutes of being basically ignored by the wait staff, we left with empty stomachs, out $50.00. Total waste, will probably never return. Bummer! :-(",

    "text": "Amazing !! Amazing!! Amazing !!  -- Herb Box is becoming my new found meet for lunch / dinner spot.  Local food made fresh and delicious with savory spot -on flavors..you must try it!  It's been awhile since I have wanted to write a review for anything, but tonight my tastebuds and I want to sing to the world! Hallelujah and Rejoice!   I have always loved the far north Herb Box which is a lovely place and a great place. But now Herb Box is more centrally located in Scottsdale at the  larger Southbridge venue. This promises to be a great place to meet friends for breakfast, lunch or dinner  when anywhere near the  area.  The brand new look and feel says we have thought this out and we want you to be comfortable but feel impressed. Great spacing , lighting and seating make the place very inviting ...it just screams bring your friends over, meet me for a drink or appetizer,  stop in for breakfast after farmers market. Don't miss the girls bathroom .Regal feel with some sweet surprise...yes that is a sink...the mirror felt like I was Alice in Wonderland.... Tonight  for dinner we enjoyed the lovely cilantro and crab dip with fried plantains ,that make me smile and plot how I can steal more...shall I say it accidentally feel on the floor and demand more ? I just might.  Shh don't tell.  Mike and I split the flatbread/ pizza with pear and Gorgonzola that just excites the tongue...It is savory comfort food for sure.  We also split the Thai Ribs..Oh my Gravy !!..wow!! ..ribs with BBQ sauce that is completely thai and spicy and burn  you but   in  a good way ..loved it!  We also had the Gouda mac and cheese,  creamy , rich and make you fell like someone whipped the up just for you.. Mom had a large piece of salmon roasted in honey with guess what?  super tasty parsnips ..yup I said parsnips...I thought they were a joke food but no longer, parsnips are now on my to do list.   We finished off the meal with more mind grabbing tastes. biting into  a chocolate tart that had the right mix of sweet and decadence without feeling like you ate a spoonful of  chocolate frosting ,very cravable and a must for every diner. We also shared a sweet little Crostina with berries ...tasted great, without an over sweetness so common to many restaurants.I  must also mention the great blackberry jasmine green tea , so refreshing.   The Herb Box is full of great tastes , and if that is not enough ,...there is an adjacent market  chocked full of great tastes to go with an emphasis on local fare. ( think CROWS DAIRY and QUEEN CREEK OLIVE MILL ) They have foods to go , cheeses , dairy and great out of this world baked goods.  My plan, next time I need a bite before heading to the mall, is to grab a delicious treat , a small wedge of chees and a piece of fruit , no more mall food for me.   Yes I loved it .Yelpers keep your eyes open for the UYE soon to be announced   by me    ...You are in for a delightful treat.",

    "text": "I came in the Market Place to check out the saturday morning \"farmer's market\" and was starving so I hit up the Herb Box for a little breakfast to go. It is a really pretty restaurant and the display/takeout area was clean and organized but all I needed was food and I needed it in my stomach 20 minutes ago. I didn't even glance at the menu, just pointed at a slice of quiche in the display case and slid $5 across the counter. And yes, I may have pretended that I was going to \"go home and eat it\" thus refusing a fork and napkins, but I ate it cold, with my hands, sitting on a bench and it was just okay.   Yeah I get those aren't the greatest conditions to savor food. it was in fact, an artichoke, sun-dried tomato and goat cheese quiche and it was easily a 4\" wide slice which is huge (for food...). It just didn't really have any flavor and the crust was too thick on the bottom and too crumbly up at the top (and extra buttery).   Now I will say that alongside the quiche in the display case were some of the most outrageously gorgeous cupcakes I have ever seen in my life. A blood red velvet cupcake with thick glossy white frosting that was piled at least 3\" high. And a chocolate cupcake with what looked like creamy chocolate mousse on top. If for some reason I'm ever back in this area I will absolutely sit down and have a meal or 50 cupcakes. But probably not the quiche.",

I think it was a bit pricey, but that may be because I am used to getting stuffed, which I wasn't, for far less money.  While some may say the service was slow I would call it relaxed, nothing came quickly but there was no rush to get us out of there.  I think it is deliberate on their end to create a relaxed atmosphere, however turning tables slowly added to the high rent district they are in has a cost that has to be applied to the food.  Speaking of the food; I had the salmon hash but also tried several other dishes.  My plate was delicious but I would certainly consider the Red Velvet pancakes as they were the True definition of desert for breakfast.  And they serve a decaf which tastes like real coffee!  The True test of any review has to be whether I would return and/or recommend it to my friends.  Yes on both accounts but not often as, for me, it is priced as a special occasion place.",

When I called they sent me to the Market downstairs and the girl at the counter was SO helpful, sweet and even gave me a discount bec I work down the road. This company has by far the nicest restaurant staff I've encountered in Scottsdale. I came in COVERED in paint (I'm a painting teacher) with my apron still on and the girl at the counter was never once judgmental.  thank you Herb Box. The food never falters and your staff always surprise me with warm greeting smiles.",

We were seated and had to wait 10 more minutes before we were greeted by another server who had noticed our hangry stares. We placed orders with him and were still waiting for waters and drinks 30 minutes after our reservation time. He was nice but seemed overwhelmed.  30 Minutes later we were still waiting on food. We had a flight to catch (Which we told them when we ordered) so we were forced to cancel our orders and leave. We were still charged for the drinks. So many mistakes, so little apologies. Unacceptable.",

    "text": "This is a very hip place on the canal in Old Town, with a lovely patio for very romantic dining or just enjoying an evening with friends (as I did last night).....a little above average in price, but not terribly bad for Scottsdale, where pretty much every restaurant is above average in price.  There were four of us dining - we each had one drink or cocktail, we split the Veggie Nosh Board as an appetizer, and each had one entree - our bill before tip was $136.   I know others have complained about the service, but we had excellent service - our waiter was wonderful - attentive and made good suggestions, kept our water glasses filled, and was friendly.  Around here Thursday night is generally a busy night, but we never felt like we weren't getting top-notch service.  As for the food, that was hit-or-miss.   I highly recommend the Vegetarian Nosh Board ($19) as an appetizer for a group (it was perfect for the 4 of us) - very tasty, nice presentation, nice variety of goodies.  I would even have that all by myself as an entree.  The rest was not as good....I had the Kobe Burger, and it was about the worst I've ever had - way overcooked (I asked for medium-well but it was beyond well done), very dry, and very tough - normally one should be able to cut a burger with a fork, I had to struggle to cut mine with a knife.  And yes, the default way of serving it is bun-less but our server asked if I wanted a bun with mine - if they forget to ask, then speak up if you want one.  The apple-jicama slaw was fresh and tasty, but the fingerling potatoes, which the menu described as 'smashed' came fried instead......they weren't bad, but had I known I would have ordered something else as I try to avoid fried foods.  My boyfriend had the butternut squash enchiladas, and said they were okay - not terrible, not great, just meh.  Of the four of us, the only one who enjoyed his entree was a friend who had the short-rib enchiladas, he did say they were very good.  I would definitely try the Herb Box again, but I doubt it would become a regular go-to restaurant for us, due to the price and the inconsistency in the food.   SO for Ambiance it gets an A+, for Food it gets a B-, and for price it gets a C.",

Didn't realize they didn't open until late afternoon (it was 1pm). Any True sushi fanatic can tell you, when the heart wants sushi, it wants sushi.  But we made our \"Plan B\" option as The Herb Box. Okay, great! Still want sushi, but am excited to try this new place.  Well, as it turns out - I thought the little place on the corner was The Herb Box - it's not. That's the Herb Box Market! Not a lot of seating outside either. This was all let out in the open when I couldn't find my damn friends at the hostess station.   Thought the girl who took my order was rather aloof, but did learn she was pretty new on the job so I cut her major slack.   Ordered their Breakfast Burrito - it was good, but nothing to write home about. My GFs had buckwheat pancakes and pulled pork street tacos.   I'll go back - but this time - to the real McCoy, as their patio furniture was a bit stained and weathered.",

The most recent time we went, though, our server wasn't particularly kind, and the Steak Salad actually wasn't that good.    Their patio is dog friendly, they occasionally have live music, and there's a great view of the waterfront.  So outside of Summer, it's terrific.    I'd say this is a great choice for a date night. I would say it's better for lunch and dinner than it is for breakfast.  ENJOY!",

We decided to stop in at the Herb Box because it was a beautiful day out, it was walking distance from the office, and the food looked yummy!  Thank you Yelpers, for this place did not disappoint! We shared the cilantro crab dip - creamy, crabby goodness that had just enough acidity to get our palates going. The plantain chips were an excellent touch - the perfect vehicle for all of that crabby yumminess. I had the burger (medium) on ciabatta. It was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and had the most amazing apple coleslaw to add crunch, bite, and contrast. These came with sweet potato chips which were absolutely addicting! We also shared a side of the gouda mac and cheese - very cheesy, but surprisingly not heavy at all!  Our server was fantastic! Our waters never emptied, our soda/tea stayed full, and he always checked in at appropriate times. This was the best possible way to end our short trip :)",

A group of us were actually contemplating getting up to try a different restaurant. The waitress somehow knew what we were planning, came to us just in time to recommend some of the most delicious dishes I've tried in a long time.   Our table shared the falafel appetizers that my friend described by saying \"there is no meat but they make it taste like it is.\" ... more simplistically put...it's good falafel!   brother got the thai ribs which comes with a side of mac and cheese and apple salad. DELICIOUS. supposedly the best ribs he ever had.  i shared the serrano-avocado shrimp salad which has the perfect amount of spice and crunch. The shrimp IS fried and the salad is topping two slices of bread though. The shrimp was cooked to perfection and eating half was more than sufficient.

The bartenders were super friendly and willing to whip up any concoction that wanted.   I started with a lemon and basil martini that was absolutely DELISH. Any drink with basil wins my heart. Next, we nibbled on their Kale, Corn, and Sweet Onion Pakora. Holy heaven! This was a recommendation from their bartender because they were out of my FAVORITE cilantro-lime crab dip {...still sad about this! It is THE best!}. But the Kale appetizer had the most amazing flavors and was crisped to perfection. I would most definitely get it again!  I also have to note their amazing customer service. They were super busy the day we were in and the bartender forgot to place our appetizer order, SO he brought us a round of yummy shots (that were more like the size of drinks). Okay, twist our arms, we aren't hangry anymore. ;) They have a new fresh cocktail menu coming soon that will include exotic spices and fresh juices. You better believe that we'll be back for that! & crossing fingers they have my favorite crab dip next time!",

We wanted to detox a little post-Thanksgiving and The Herb Box did not disappoint. Located in adorable Old Town Scottsdale, while you eat the Trolley drives by and during the holiday there are pretty lights outside too. And of course it's Arizona so it's usually not that cold and you can dine outside. We were able to take advantage of happy hour so we had $5 appetizers. We tried the brussel sprouts chips and the crispy cauliflower with quinoa. Both were OMG delicious.  We also had the butternut squash enchiladas. I added the quinoa from our appetizer to mine. So, so good! Great texture and delicious taste. And then for dessert - chocolate beet cake! Yes beets in the chocolate cake, with a mousse inside and whipped cream on top. YUM to the max!  Not that this is why you should choose a restaurant BUT their restrooms are really really cute. Definitely check that out (to the ladies! don't know what the mens looks like!)",

We are gluten free and the kids menu is horrible for that even though the menu has lots of GF options.  The manager was super accommodating for our daughter's gluten allergy and made her a bacon grilled cheese on GF bread with tomato bisque which was a HUGE hit!  Props to them for being crafty and handling the situation well. Brussels sprouts chips are a MUST, even our non veggie eating kid loved them. The salmon was very good and the fig and goat cheese chicken was perfection. Maurice is a fantastic server.  Very concerned about your enjoyment.",

We came in during the awkward switch between lunch and dinner servers, so we were taken care of by a few different members of the staff, each just as friendly & helpful as the last - they didn't skip a beat. Thank you for such warm service! The new location is beautiful and I think they'll have a very successful run.   Everything we ate was amazing! Every bite! The Korean cauliflower, kale chips, and Thai bbq wings off the happy hour menu all have amazing flavor and are a serious steal for only $5 each. We also shared the butternut squash & corn enchiladas.... you guys, this dish is just so soo good. By the time we were done, my mom was trying to buy a to-go container filled with just the tomatillo enchilada sauce! These enchiladas have won best vegetarian dish in Scottsdale for the past few years in a row, and for good reason. It's also served with a side salad that I'm definitely going to try my best to recreate at home - so good.   Also! The melon mule is awesome! A little sweet due to the melon vodka but I don't like mules with a ginger bite anyways so it was perfect for me.   This is fresh food done right :) we'll be back!",

With crispy shrimp, avocado toasts, arugula, fried fennel pancetta, sweet-hot serrano glaze, lemon-honey vinaigrette...it was so flavorful and filling because of the toast. ($15). My friend had the Edamame Chop Chop Bowl and it was lovely, with roasted edamame & corn salsa, edamame hummus, radish, shredded raw beets, avocado, candied pepitas black quinoa, lemon-honey vinaigrette ($14). We didn't feel too heavy after our meals too which is great after a workout! Service was very fast and friendly. I'm definitely going to be back!",

The decor in the room is great (I loved the paint color!) and it was a nice atmosphere for a family gathering.  They have a great selection of wine, beer, and cocktails. I'm pregnant and they even had a great mango juice for me. The starters would have been a great dinner on their own. The pear and gorgonzola flatbread was my favorite.   Entrees were great. I'm a vegetarian and had the squash and corn enchiladas, which were delicious and the side salad was interesting enough to stand on its own. My very carnivorous family also loved their various entrees.  Most of all, I want to complement the incredible service. We were gathering because of a death in the family and the server could not have been more sensitive and graceful coming into a private room in the midst of sad stories and tears. That guy deserves a medal.  Also, given the huge amount of food and alcohol we ordered, the gratuity that was already in the bill, and the private room, the price was very reasonable. I expected to pay easily double what we ended up paying.  Highly recommend. Will definitely go next time I'm in Scottsdale.",

My son wanted to take me to Herb Box so it sounded alright to me.   We got there right when they opened at 9am. Lots of open parking but after 10am forget it.  We decided to eat outside. What a great idea. Right next to the River Walk with a cool breeze and shaded the whole time. Excellent. Very relaxing.   Our server came pretty quickly for our drink orders and I got the cappuccino and my son got the Mango Ice Tea. Both were really good. My Cappuccino was a little small but well worth it.    I got the Smoked Salmon hash. Oh my goodness. So good. Really nice portion of smoked salmon with grilled potatoes, eggs, bacon, capers, and green onions. You get a small side of red pepper aioli. I poured that aioli all over and boom. So good. The aioli sauce gave it a nice kick. It's a good portion and really filled me up. Loved it. I would have no problem ordering this again.   My son got the breakfast burrito. All I know is it had egg and bacon but I know there was other stuff in it too. I got a bite and it was so good. Looked good. Tasted good and my son just loved it.   The service was really good. They really didn't rush you but let you just enjoy the outdoors. They filled up our water cups and checked on us to make sure everything was ok.   I just loved it at Herb Box. Really good food. Really good service. Great ambiance. Right by the river walk with a nice breeze today. As you can tell I really enjoyed it. I will definitely be back.

My husband had to hunt him down to pay the bill after sitting there for about 30 mins. Worst experience dining out in Scottsdale. If you're vegan or vegetarian, there are LOTS of other options! Also there were chunks of something from the almond milk in our cups. Freaking gross. Should have gone to Montauk.",

The only gripe I had about the place is that they classify themselves as \"healthy\" - I wouldn't really necessarily consider deep fried kale and sugar-crusted salmon that healthy, but I definitely didn't leave with a heavy, bloated feeling even after such a large meal. I'd love to come back again with more people; the menu lends itself to sharing multiple dishes!",

In our case his name was Andy and his personality, knowledge of the menu and dry wit kept our group entertained while we enjoyed their incredible dining options. Her Box management, take note: Andy is someone you're going to want to hold on to on your staff.   Beyond the friendly back-and-forth with the server, our meal was exquisite. I mulled over a couple menu items like the fried chicken but quickly decided that the filet mignon was what I needed. I couldn't have been happier with that decision after slicing off and biting into a piece of the tender,  melt-in-your-mouth meat. The seasoning was just amazing and almost worth making another trip to AZ for. I tried my friends Thai-style ribs and found them equally delicious. The two together made a heavenly sweet and savory combo.   The entrees weren't the only impressive edibles. The mac n' cheese, with a unique, herby creaminess and the signature cocktails were also winners in my book. I'd easily bring back a large party for another fantastic dinner. Especially if Andy entertains!",

Not only was he super friendly and attentive but had a great sense of humor, made great recommendations on dishes to consider and avoid. The use of his adjectives like \"Narnia\" and other fantasy words made ordering quite fun. His name is Andy.   It's hard to find a restaurant in old town Scottsdale that has decent spirits so much to my surprise this place had old raj gin, so I ordered it on the rocks.   In terms of ordering food I was in between the fried chicken and the Thai baby back ribs. I ended up ordering the ribs because they came with mac & cheese from \"Narnia\" and were highly recommended. The ribs were fall off the bone kind of ribs, and some of the better ones I've had in recent memory. You always know a good rib when no meat sticks to the bone and these were exactly that.  I was also able to try a piece of my friends filet mignon and it was fantastic. I'm pretty sure the group had a memorable meal but mostly due in part to our server. If you find yourself in old town and are looking for a good old American style bistro this is a solid option.",

    "text": "FANTASTIC SUMMER PATIO!  I typically don't want to give up my favorite summer patio spots because here in AZ a good shaded patio is often hard to come by.  I just love this place so much I felt I was doing an injustice by not writing about it!   The patio is shaded with misters.  The food is really great quick lunch fare (they also serve breakfast but I haven't tried it yet).  What steals the show in the summer along with the patio is the lemonade that I traditionally like to mix with the blackberry jasmine tea.  I am officially addicted!   Taking a large glass out to the over-sized seating on the patio under the misters on a beautiful summer day is the best because their patio is shaded by the building.  It's not a large patio but it really is such a peaceful spot!    The food is very yummy and the big pro is most of it is exceptionally healthy.  They use fresh ingredients, and have unique salads.  The jalapeno avocado hummus is a must try.    Of course I can't help but mention what a wonderful staff they have.  I'm finding on the hot days when most people just want to go home and chill in the comfort of their AC the staff at The Herb Box is friendly, kind and welcoming.  I appreciate this as I know it is hard for businesses to make it through the rough summer months here in AZ.  Thanks guys for doing what you do!",

My husband had the short rib tacos which were also nice.    Our server was a bit odd, but overall did a nice job.  When ordering a beer we asked for suggestions and he said, \"Yeah, it's a good beer.  Convinced me to switch from bud light\"  While not a roaring endorsement for a boutique beer, it was still a good suggestion.  While there might not be lots of child-friendly food items on the menu, the restaurant is child-friendly and appropriate with plenty of room around tables for a high chair and not too quiet to bring well-behaved little ones.",

We started with a Bloody Mary (pretty good) and a specialty cocktail (can't remember which one and their online menu isn't current).  For lunch we got the Korean fried cauliflower, the mac n cheese and the pear and Gorgonzola flat-bread.   Everything was good - especially the smoked Gouda mac n cheese, which is delicious...  with a nice crisped top and tons of cheesy goodness.  My pear and Gorgonzola flat-bread was also a highlight, with a nice crisp crust.    The menu is interesting and just borders on the verge of being a little too vegan/healthy for me.  Non health nuts will find some things to eat, but your choices are a little limited.    Service was friendly and efficient.  Bathrooms are over designed (you'll get soaked attempting to use their modern concept sink - which is pretty but completely nonfunctional) and too small and dark.    I would recommend if you're visiting Old Town Scottsdale.",

I loved the interior decoration which remind me of a relaxing beach cottage.   Our server was fantastic and very passionate and knowledgeable with the menu.   The food was yummy and flavorful we ordered the following options:   Urban market steak salad which was so good. Steak was done medium just as requested served with watercress, avocado, sweet red pepper, sugared pecans, bacon, sweet dried corn and house blue cheese vinaigrette.   MY favorite: Serrano Garlic shrimp salad which was mouth watering and perfect amount of spice (not over powering) with Serrano chili, you can request the sauce to be on the side if you are afraid of spice. Shrimp were served over avocado toasts and wild arugula, crisp fennel, pancetta and lemon honey vinaigrette.   We also had the breakfast steak and eggs, Stead was done to perfection and was served with potatoes.   I will return when I am back in Scottsdale.",

Can I please have dried strawberries every day???   If I lived here or would be in the area longer, this place would definitely be a regular spot for me!",

Then he never came back to refill our drinks, uhm, it's a holiday party. Three, he brought the check before asking if we wanted desert, uhm, still a holiday party. Four, we asked for coffee, it was lukewarm, and he didn't want \"to bother\" the other server refilling the sweetener holders, so let's bring it after everyone is done with dessert?  So considerate to your fellow worker, throw us under the bus instead.  Uggh. Not such a great impression for our company dinner. Maybe we go somewhere where the $300 plus bill actually gets you service on a very slow night for them.",

To die for! I want another one right now!  The cucumber basil mojito was very tasty and refreshing.   This particular time at the restaurant stood out because of our server, Drew. He had the best personality and was so bubbly and helpful. Happy to answer any and all questions and provided great customer service. Logan was his trainee and he was just as pleasant and helpful as Drew.   The Herb Box is quickly becoming my new favorite spot :-)",

The decor is modern and comfortable (including the bathrooms), but needs some love or an update. The service is good 90% of the time.  They also have live, relaxing music.  The sangria was good (and they kindly subbed soda for sprite in the recipe).  During my last visit I ordered the Vegan Nosh Board - I think it used to be enough food for two people, but now (maybe because they made it the token gluten-free/vegan menu option) it's a small amount of food.  Asparagus and peppers cooked crispy in heavy oil, kale cooked crispy in heavy oil, hummus with artichoke heart, and a small sweet potato cake with corn and pomegranate topping. It was all good, but could have used less oil (the veggies tasted like they were fried in it). Extra star for the word \"vegan\" on the menu so that I didn't have to ask about dairy/egg.  Pricier than average, but normal for Scottsdale.  They didn't have any creative vegan dessert options. Our server said that they weren't very popular when they had them (let me guess...token gluten-free/vegan option? Yuck.).",

My concierge told me not to do it if they don't do anything for me.

The food could have been mediocre and we would have had a nice night; however, the food was far from mediocre.  Very delicious.  Started out with the beef carpaccio which was really good but just a little bit too salty.  I could not tell if the salt was added on or just due to the meat but tasted like extra salt was added for seasoning.  For dinner we had the trout (cooked perfectly) with this yummy mac and cheese as a side.  We also had the balsamic beet side.  I am a huge fan of beets and they did a great job with this side.  Definitely recommend giving The Herb Box a try if you are in the North Scottsdale area.",

    "text": "I remember this place when it was on shea and it was only open for lunch and they mostly did catering and had weird hours. I would always get the chicken arugula wrap and I could never get enough. Then it got popular and then it moved closer to me...I absolutely love their whole menu...I cannot get enough of this place.  Let's start with breakfast...OMG the red velvet pancakes...can you say DELICIOUS and FABULOUS!!! i do not even like pancakes but these are amazing and they are so decadent...You also have to try the granola trifle it is great for something on the lighter end, but it is filling. The Market Street BLT is also a favorite I love the pancetta and that the sandwich is on a brioche makes it even better! The strawberry Lassi is nice and refreshing...another fabulous option is the Chilequiles the pulled pork is so tender and flavorful...yum yum yum...also try the Goat Cheese and Chive omelet!! I promise you will not be disappointed with this place for breakfast! They have brunch which combines breakfast and lunch/dinner menu items.  Lunch/Dinner options OMG OMG OMG...starters are amazing try the sweet potato chips, the hummus, the prosciutto wrapped shrimp are a great starter...they are just amazing!! There are so many sandwiches to choose from because they are all great! I love the Grilled Chicken and Sage Pesto sandwich!!!!! I love the apple and with the pesto and goat cheese....great combo!!! The grilled petite fromage is fantastic as well...my son loves this sandwich and he is two! I love the coconut shrimp salad it is amazing!! Now the flatbreads are so fantastic you can get these for your meal or to share with the table. My favorites are all of them!!!!! I cannot just pick one! They are all phenomenal!  They all have great ingredients and how they make each one is just fantastic.  I cannot get enough!!!  Then there are the enchiladas...I do not even like butternut squash but these are great!  The pecans are awesome with it!!  The Kobe Burger and the short rib tacos are two other great entrees...The two last entrees that I love are the thai bbq ribs and the beef tenderloin!!  Now there are the sides that you could have as lunch or dinner too...there is the mac and cheese OMG talk about rich!!  The mushroom risotto cake they are great!!! I love it!!! My favortie  desserts are the chocolate cake...yum who doesnt love a great chocolate cake...but my all time favorite dessert here is the peach ice cream sandwich cookie....the caramel is amazing!!   I cannot say enough good things about this place.  I love this restaurant!  I wish I could go more often!",

I ordered my usual-- the Albacore Tuna Pita (a scoop of tuna salad over a bed of arugula/greens/tomatoes, comes with 3 grilled pita triangles), but didn't get it until 30 minutes later!  Good thing I wasn't on a lunch break, because if I was, I wouldn't have had time to eat it.  I think a 30-minute waiting time for a salad is pretty ridiculous...I can't imagine what the wait would have been if I had ordered something that needed to be cooked.  Maybe that was just a fluke that day.    Anyway, I would advise to call ahead and/or just eat inside.  Marketplace to go = 2 stars Herb Box all together= 4 stars",

A friend and I met for Sunday Brunch which was great because it allowed us the full breakfast menu as well as the lunch menu if we wanted.    Not being a big egg fan, I was hesitant at trying the Chilaquiles, but the waiter informed me that I could get just one egg if I preferred.  It was actually delicious!  The tomatillo salsa that they pair with the pork creates the right combination of flavors.  The food is a little on the pricier side but that is what you get if you want all fresh local ingredients.  I am definitely willing to pay more for quality, which is exactly what the Herb Box has.  Not to mention the beautiful patio seating which should not be missed out on if the weather is right!",

Everything is delicious and healthy. Best of all the get their meats and vegetables from local farmers and it shows in the taste. The service is always outstanding.

Wonder why food was taking so lonng.  He said they were busy.  Guests who arrived after me were already served. He said it would be right out, and he came back with it so quickly that I knew without having to taste that my short rib enchiladas had been sitting under a light too long.

    "text": "I am usually a big fan of the Herb Box (especially their gouda mac, its usually killer), however the last time we came, the food seemed lackluster and sloppily put together. The gouda mac was overcooked and severely missing seasoning, and the fried chicken was lacking the crispiness that I was craving (the take on  Mexican street corn that accompanied it was gross). Additionally, our crab dip was barren, and while we were expecting a thick, creamy dip, we received a watery soup-like bowl with the occasional chunk of crab. Perhaps this could be because it was their first day open post summer schedule, however for the price tag, the food quality was weak at best. The only thing keeping me from a 1 star review are my previous experiences at Herb Box, which have been pretty delightful.. However after this last experience, it might take me a while before I gain the courage to come back.",

I loved the free range chicken I had and the unlimited glasses of Mango Lemonade that they make there at the restaurant was also amazing! Not to mention the service was great :) Just a really great place all around and I'm glad we had our company party there!",

I also had a side of scrambled eggs which were just right. We also ordered the Market Steak Salad. The steak was unbelievably tender and everything else about the salad was delicious.  The portions were big for both of our entrees and the prices I felt were very fair for the quality of food. The service was excellent too. You should definitely make it a point when in Old Town Scottsdale to come for brunch at the Herb Box.",

She brought wine glasses, so we asked for champagne glasses, she said they were all out of them because of the Mimosa $5.00 brunch special? Um didn't we ask if they had any specials?? So We did try to talk to her about this & she said it wouldn't have made a difference as they were out of champagne? Well, we then see people served MIMOSAS. No apologies, were made to us.

I eat out for lunch almost every day of the week, either with vendors, my co-workers, or clients. Places open for lunch need to be on top of their game for the professional crowd, and the Herb Box falls short. There were times I would look around the restaurant and would not see a waiter for a good 10 minutes. If you head there for lunch, expect a minimum of 2 hours. Granted, a very delicious 2 hours, but none the less, 2 hours of unbillable time.  If you do have 2 hours to spare for lunch or you head out for dinner (I cannot speak of their dinner service), I highly recommend their burger with the brie cheese and green apple/jicama relish.

Had the smoked turkey on ciabatta, rosemary steak ciabatta, with the yummus/tzaziki/olives appetizer. WARNING do not get an appetizer unless you are hungry as a hippo!! The sandwiches and wraps come with these deelicious sweet potato chipperoos, both of which will fill you up like a cactus on a rainy day.   The tab came up to ~$35, an eency bit steep for me for lunch as I probably could have had the same quality of food/service at the Jungle (of Pita, that is), but nonetheless just as excellent and well worth another visit the next time I stop by Scott's and Dale's hood!",

The actual meal was very delicious, and the decor was amazing.  With that being said I will deduct a star for mediocre service.  I couldn't help but feel was though our waiter was in a hurry to serve, no smiles were given.  The beautiful people of scottsdale all were packed in, so its a cool place if you are looking to people watch,(my father would love it.)",

    "text": "Food was great in theory, but don't expect any dietary restrictions you have to be competently accommodated. Example: can't eat most grains, so ask for the shrimp on the salad to be grilled (rather than battered and fried), and the avocado not to be on toast. Shrimp grilled, but avocado appears mashed and spread on toast AND the server failed to mention that the fennel on the salad is also battered and fried. This silliness happened after I had already asked about tweaking two other items to be to accommodate dietary restrictions, and was told that everything is \"made fresh\" except for, apparently, those other two items.  This appears to be part-and-parcel of the service problems referred to by other reviewers; our service was also extraordinarily SLOW. One member of our party waited 10 minutes for his food after the rest had been delivered.   To top it off, I'm not really sure what the restaurant is doing having the gardener moving around whatever buckets and cloths and chemicals/pesticides he's using in the immediate vicinity of actively eating tables. It's not like the place is open for breakfast during the week, couldn't the owners have scheduled plant maintenance for a morning?",

    "text": "I'm a fan of The Herb Box. I realize I'd been there once before and really enjoyed it then as well.  Today the family came by to meet for lunch and I happened to have an email in my inbox with the new lunch menu at Shea. Talk about good timing. I'm trying to be a bit better at eating healthy and looking at the menu, there seemed to be a number of selections that would let me do that & still enjoy the food.  From looking at the menu, it was nice to see that they buy local where possible and are part of the Slow Food movement.  We started with the housemade sweet potato chips with sea salt and curry. These are ridiculously addictive. My 2  year old kept telling us \"don't eat them all\" and putting her hand over the basket. We all couldn't stop. While they might not really be, they even seemed healthy-ish (for chips anyway). I'd love to see if they had an extra curry version.  For lunch, we ordered the market sunflower salad (with chicken, bacon, goat cheese, dried berries, sunflower seeds & balsamic vinaigrette), the blackened chicken caesar salad (with crisp romaine, cotija cheese, tortilla strips and a chipotle-parmesan caesar dressing), and the kids split the brown sugar pork sandwich (with watercress-jicama slaw).  As our little ones have dairy and egg allergies, they were great about working around that and giving us suggestions. They were super nice with the kids too.  The food was excellent all the way around. I'm not by nature a big salad guy but I went that way as I'm trying to lay off the carbs a bit. I really liked both and will be eager to order either of them again.   I'm also eager to try some of the more carb-y items on the menu when I can. They had a couple of soups that sounded wonderful.   The service was great. Our server was quite knowledgeable, super personable and very engaging. He also put up with our 2 girls flirting with him non-stop.  As far as drinks, we did green tea and blackberry jasimine tea. Both were quite nice.  As I'm committed to staying on this healthy train, I think there will be many, many more visits to The Herb Box in my future. At present, I'm hard pressed to think a better healthy/tasty lunch option.",
