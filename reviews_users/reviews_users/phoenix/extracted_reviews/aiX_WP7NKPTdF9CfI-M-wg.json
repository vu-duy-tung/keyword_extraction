    "text": "I was very concerned to go here when my neighbors invited me out for dinner with my family when I saw the reviews from the last week. Ignore any bad reviews!!! We went tonight with reservations at 4 PM. We were greeted by all friendly staff members, seated immediately and the ambience was awesome! We had a very attentive server, Who was extremely knowledgeable of the menu. He was also very friendly. All expediters were very friendly and super fast too! The drinks were good, and all food was really good also. We  brought our kids and they loved the food and said it was worth the drive!! We drove from Gilbert. One of my kids got the pretzels and cheese from the adult appetizer menu, one got the chicken tenders from the kids menu, one of us got the sweet corn ravioli, and one got the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Two of us decided that we wanted to share the chopped Italian salad and the bistro steak. Steak was cooked perfectly and they even split our plates in the kitchen for us so we didn't have to do it ourselves at the table. They were very accommodating! We will be back especially when it's cooler so we can enjoy the awesome patio with corn hole, foozball, and ping pong!",

We started with some of the house made chips and onion dip (very good) and some chicken tortilla soup (also very good).  We moved on to sandwiches (turkey pastrami and pub burger)  also very good.  They g=have a good selection of beers and some house-specialty drinks that we tried.  The atmosphere was very busy and LOUD.  It is not a place to go for conversations unless you like to yell.  I would highly recommend making reservations as it was very busy.",

Our friends and I have heard about culinary dropout and have been wanting to stop by. We made a trip to the zoo and decided to stop by for some lunch. My family and I came in late so met our friends at the table. A waitress came up to us and said the area we were at was a reserved area so we had to move to the other side. Those tables all had reserved on it but another waiter said we could sit there. Someone came up and said they would send us a waiter to clean the table and take our order. We waited 10 minutes and nothing. There was a couple that came in sat next to us and someone went up to them greeted them and took a drink order. Still no one came to us. I called for someone and she said ohh I'll send someone right over. Waited another 10 minutes and nothing. We ended up leaving and was never acknowledged that we were there! When we mentioned it to the hosts (who was one of the girls that said she'd send someone to us) she smirked. I do not recommend this place!

Honestly I'd rate this whole thing five stars except for the small fact that we sat on the outer edge of the outside eating area.  The misters were on so strong that the couch-style seating was so wet that it instantly soaked my slacks and my underwear and after five minutes the back of my shirt was damp.  An hour after leaving the restaurant and getting home, my boxers were still completely wet Seriously I'm not being dramatic.  It was obnoxious.   That being said, I would return.

This was a great combination, especially since there was a wait for our table, which can be expected on a hot summer's day.  These amenities are what set it apart from other eateries in the area, similiar to college dropout at the time of its commerical release. There were the references to jewelery and the finer things in life like othet albums at the time, but with the self awareness to discuss these things in relation to society as a whole that set it apart.  You get the unexpected: College Dropout had its social commentary, but it also gave you some timeless hits that lean less in that direction.  We had to wait some time for our table, and for our patience the house manager got us a free app and round of drinks for our time once we were seated. This is the first time this has ever happened for me at a restaurant and, much like the second half of College Dropout, very refreshing and unexpected.  Guest verses: Kanye spent many years making  beats for others,  and as a result got many others to drop some verses on his album. Our experience at Culinary also included some guest appearances that made our experienxe that much better. Shoutout to Leah, our server who was one of the nicest people on earth.  Shoutout to Huss Brewing, for their Koffee Kolsch, sending me to lactose heaven.  This is my analogy, I don't care if it's a weak one, cause I'm sticking to it.",

The food is very basic American (I would love something more flavorful) but amazing considering most people come here just for the bar, and the food is an extra perk. Amazing for groups, and totally beats Scottsdale's busy and chaotic nightlife scene. This place is a must for visitors looking to relax.",

    "text": "It's interesting how different locations of the same restaurant can create a different feeling.  I love the Scottsdale location.  It's one of my favorite restaurants.  But the young college student vibe of the Tempe location was not for me.    This location is near ASU.  Good choice of music, but loud.  The inside seating was unusual, with many longer \"family style\" tables.  Interesting decor of tin siding, old wood, unusual lights, and comfy sofas in the \"outside\" seating section.  Which doesn't seem like outside as it's covered.  The restaurant is located in a huge building called The Yard.  There are three restaurants and in between are ping-pong tables and lots of cornhole boards.  One competitive foursome was intently focused on the game for the entire hour we were there.    The food is, of course, the same delicious stuff as at the other locations.  I'd drive anywhere for those pretzel bread bites with cheese fondue!  The prime rib dip sandwich is one of the best I've ever had.  Kale and strawberry salad with chicken or salmon could easily be an entree.  My son loved his Pub Burger.  Usually I'd stick around for Monkey Bread for dessert, but we were on our way to a Segway tour around the Tempe lake.  I do have to give 5 stars for the service.  Our server was friendly, answered all questions with a smile, and made our requested ingredient changes seem like no problem.",

    "text": "09/30/2018 Yelp review Culinary Dropout Tempe AZ 149 S Farmer Ave, Tempe, AZ 85281  (480) 240-1601  I have recently visited Culinary Dropout for one of my best friend's birthday. My first impression of this place is amazing set up, seems like a cozy dining kind of restaurant with the option of sitting both indoor and outdoor. The waiting line is really wrong and reservation is not an option. This threw me off a little bit. After a long time of waiting, the waiter let us sit at a table at the outdoor area while waiting. We ended up dining at that table.  We went there on a Saturday night, also Game night at ASU, that might be the reason why the restaurant was really busy and the service is slow. We waited at the table for 15 minutes till a waiter came and ask us about what we wanted to order. We ordered 2 double cheese burgers and 2 tacos with an appetizer of their soft pretzel and melted cheese. I was quite impressed with the appetizer. The pretzel was made in shape of small buns, still hot, lightly salted and served in a basket. The cheese is melted in a tiny pot on top of a (also) tiny stove with candle inside. The portion of this dish is quite big, more than enough for us, a group of 4 people. The main dish finally came out after about 30 minutes of waiting. I got the steak tacos dish with Pico De Gallo salad. To be honest, I was  very satisfied with this dish, the steak was well marinated with an interesting twist of the Pico De Gallo and the creamy . It seems like the rest of my friends also enjoyed their dish.   Even though the outdoor seating area was quite hot due to the fact there were no AC or humidifier, the lovely decorations made up for it. The decoration with string lightings in warm tone really added to its coziness. There is also an area to play ping pong at the back of the restaurant. I found that quite interesting. While waiting for the food, customers can totally go over there and have a game or two with their family or friends. The only thing is this area only available to 21(years old) and above. This is a minus from me as I could not understand why this area is not available to everyone. What make this particular area 21 and above.   The prices was average, dishes range from $14 -$22 which is not so high compared to other restaurant of the same type. With the quality of the food, I personally think the price is reasonable, however, it not the type of restaurant you can go on a daily basis (as a college student).   I didn't have a chance to ask what's our waiter's name but he seems to be really friendly. Even though the restaurant was extremely busy on that day, he still managed to get to us as soon as possible, not forgetting to wish us a good meal and a great night after we're done with our meal.   Finally, I would rate this restaurant a 4.5 over 5 stars. I wouldn't recommend going to this restaurant on a Game day or a Friday night if you don't want to wait long. But so far, I am satisfied with both the food and the service at this place.",

The entire time we were there he seemed bothered if we needed anything. The real problem was one of out of town guests ordered a second drink that she never received after asking more then once. He brought the bill having charged her for the second drink and we brought it to his attention he made it seem as if the fault was ours.

    "text": "I usually recommend this place to a lot of people whenever they are visiting and gush over the trendy atmosphere, the unique fruity cocktails and savory pretzels with fondue...  However I am so over coming here because they keep overcharging the amount I was supposed to pay, AND THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME TWICE.  Yes, the servers are all very engaging friendly and draw you in so much so, however they lack attention to detail when making the transactions for the payment...   The first time they messed up my payment  they charged me twice over the amount I was supposed to pay, and only purchased a beer. I reported it and they did admit that they charged me over which I understood since they were really busy that night and may have swiped my card for the wrong order. Eventually they did credit the amount. It was fine the first time, and I had let it go,   My recent experience three days ago went well so I thought, I ordered the dinner for 2 because of the restaurant week deal that was going on. My server Franky/Franklin was super friendly convinced me that it was a good deal since I were to get an appetizer, 2 main courses, a desert split amongst 2 people for $44. The bill came out to $70 with my friend also getting a few cocktails, so we split it and with tip my receipt is about $40.   Next day my card was charged for $66, and mind you I am a poor college student amongst many others l and was shocked on why on I was charged over the amount. I called about it to dispute it and the person on the phone lacked no empathy whatsoever, no apology, nothing sincere just said \"oh well it looks like we actually don't have your card in the system.\" She wrote down all my information said she would pass it along the manager, and that they would call me by the end of the night.   Manager called me pretty late in the night apologizing which I appreciated but still couldn't find the transaction of my card on file. I explained to her that that I understood that people make mistakes however the night was slow, there should have been no mistake on swiping the right card for the right amount...   So bottom line: Ensure that the servers know when to stop being too friendly and talkative because they can eventually get so distracted in the conversations, that they might forget which card is whose and charge you the wrong amount. AND I emphasize they have to pay attention to detail. Also try to have a sense of empathy when I am trying to explain nicely that what you guys did was wrong and admit your mistake.   So yes is the food good to die for, is this a place where you want to show off your ping pong skills to the cutie across the room, and enjoy the hipster ambience of other college kids? Yes.   But if you're a struggling person in college  who can't always afford treating yourself like me, where $20 is life or death sometimes in your bank account, beware because who knows they may try to rip you off and charge more than what you owe.",

I reminded the waiter after 15 min and it took another 15 to get it.  He also ordered the wrong meal for my boyfriend, and the others in our party waited a very long time for their drinks, too.  It was hard to order a second drink because our waiter was no where to be found.  The waiter didn't comp anything after messing up the orders.  The food was mediocre.

    "text": "Beer and games? This is a recipe for success! I loved this place so much that I came twice during my short visit to Phoenix. Culinary Dropout is a spacious beer hall that offers a ton of seating as well as delicious food. They have a wide selection of seating from large booths to single tables.   The food selection is your typical bar items but the sandwiches were absolutely amazing. For food my group went with the nachos for the shareable appetizer and I chose the French Dip for the main. I must say both were very delicious! The nachos had delicious fatty pork belly all over with a type of queso as the cheese. Each bite tasted very unhealthy but it was to good to care or stop. The highlight of the meal however was the French Dip. This is probably one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The slices of meat and cheese when dipped into the savory dip turned the sandwich into a delicious delight straight from heaven. Each bite melts in your mouth and keeps you wanting more. I crushed the sandwich in a matter of minutes.  Culinary Dropout also has an outside area where you can play games. It is a very large space with several stations set up with games.  Overall, I had a great time here. The delicious food, great service, and fun atmosphere will definitely have me coming back next time I am in town.",

My daughter's guy friend sitting next to me ordered a salad as well but added chicken. I was so hungry and couldn't wait to eat. The food came in a reasonable amount of time but when my new friend and I were handed our salads we both just looked at each other. They were so small. Just a tiny bit bigger than a side salad! I saw all of the amazing ingredients in it that it said on the menu but I thought \"Is this a joke?\" So I finished the salad in about 5 minutes as did my new found friend next to me. I said \"Ummmm that was a nice side salad, now where's my $17 dinner salad I ordered?\" And he just laughed and said \"my thoughts exactly!\" So....we both went home hungry. That was a first and that will be my last time here.",

We asked again to go inside, the said we needed a contract for that they didn't seem to want to explain any real reason why we couldn't sit inside. So our people were split up in 2 1/2 to 3 areas all apart from each other. I decided along with some others if they aren't willing to allow us to sit together, we won't give them our money. I ordered water and say, visited for an hour and left to go to another place to eat. Some stayed some left, but because they were so dating unaccommodating, just didn't feel the need to spend my money there. Bad move on your part, this crowd knows how to party. Not sure I'd go back. Looks like it could have been a fun place. I had looked forward to going there finally. Not the experience I wanted.",

Not only was he friendly and full of life, but he also took the time to appeal to our party and purpose for being there. For me its all about service and he takes the cake with his ability to take all of our orders, share his personal preferences and opinions, and be playful with our sarcastic banter!! Aside from the service, the food was so delicious- not a single complaint, the drinks were plentiful and varied, and the prices were decent! They have a free valet service so we took advantage of that, too! I'll be back and hope to have Logan as our server again... (for research if you're reading this, Logan! haha).  I had the jalapeno honey lemonade which tasted so fresh and perfectly spiced; wings; pretzel bites which I presume to be a popular fave; shrimp caesar salad; the homage chips were great and so were the mussels!",

After waiting about an hour for a table, prepare for at least a 2 hour overpriced meal. The food is artesian inspired but is more basic tasting than an Instagram selfie with no filter. I'm surprised I even got my food after waiting 45+ minutes every time I've had the displeasure of dining here. My drink (the only good thing) was constantly empty and I never received an extra side of ketchup after 3 attempts. I'm convinced Chingy receives better service than this \"chillin' at the Holiday Inn\" ... Their \"scratch kitchen\" also ran out of tortilla chips AND meatloaf... UNFORGIVABLE.   If you're a basic wanna be hipster and have a lot of extra free time to overpay for mediocre \"artisan\" food that they probably ran out of... Feel free to come on by.",

The hostess was going to sit us right away but we then asked if we can try to sit outside. She said it was first come first serve. We thought we could try it outside since the misters were on. Once we got out there and sat down for 2 mins (we didn't even have time to order a drink), we decided it was way too hot. We went back inside and the hostess told us in a very unpleasant manner that it now would be a 25-30 minute wait for a table (even though the place was empty and there were clearly various 6 top tables available). We didn't want to wait 25 - 30 mins so we decided to go back outside and literally sweat it out.  Waiter was very friendly and attentive - he was the best thing about the night.  We got our drinks and order our apps - wings without nuts since one our friends had a peanut allergy. Guess what we got? Wings with nuts sprinkled all over. They got sent back and new wings came out. We then ordered our food. One of the plates was the grill cheese sliders - we asked to have it without bacon and tomatoes. Guess what we got? Grill cheese with bacon and tomatoes. That also got sent back and the kitchen argued that the order was right. The waiter had to prove himself with the meal ticket. Meanwhile we are still sweating in the 100 degree outdoor patio and the 6 top tables inside are still empty - actually no one ever sat in them at all! When I finally complained to the Manager she apologized and took 35% off the bill. I honesty think at this point the dinner should have been comped. We should have had to pay for the drinks but the food should have been taken off the bill.  I was looking forward to experiencing this place since I heard so many good things about it and it was a huge disappointment!  I hope Sam Fox and his team can get it together because it is a great concept!",

Very warm and friendly service. Went there for lunch with a bunch of work colleagues. Great ambiance. Looked more like a dinner place to me, with the stage and stuff. Absolutely recommend it.",

Experience, atmosphere, waiting staff and hostess people speaking skills and attitude and lastly food quality.   My experience was ok, I ended up going on a Sunday and we as a reservation. However, we still had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table. My family and I had to sit right next to  another family, basically rubbing elbows.   The atmosphere was young and hipster. The common trend. It was OK again nothing spectacular to talk to the neighbors about.   The waitress was nice and knowledgeable and gave her input. I enjoyed the service. She earned her 18%!   The food quality was fresh and delightful. However, the price did not match the food. But I chocked up the price to the restaurant, not the epic quality of food.   I'm guessing if you throw a bunch of tattooed folks in a building with eccentric wall art and graffiti, you can charge 15$ for a cheese sandwich.   Ok enough of my rant. I always look for appropriate prices for quality of establishment which should equate to quality of food. I don't feel the establishment matched the price.   It was nice to try something new. However, I don't think I will go out of my way to come back, it's not to say I won't come back.",

The place is very spacious, with a great variety of seating options.  It was a little loud, but much less loud than I was expecting considering the size and number of people there.   We ordered the MAC burger, the fried brussels sprouts, and deviled eggs. The burger came out first and was so good!  Perfectly cooked and the toppings complimented it well- thousand island, white onion, lettuce, and pickle.  The portion of fries was generous, and our server was able to split the burger with no extra charge.  The sprouts had too much sauce, but were very flavorful otherwise.  I also really liked the deviled eggs, which was surprising!  They were seasoned well and had bacon, which gave them just the right amount of saltiness.  Our server kept our drinks filled and was very patient in explaining the menu.  Definitely will be back for HH!",

Everything was clean, tidy, and well-organized and the staff were incredibly attentive. My glass didn't run dry the entire night.   We had a pre-fixed three course menu set out for us, and the food was delicious. We were served cheesy bread, avocado salad, fried chicken, sweet corn pasta, and apple pie with ice cream. They are incredibly accommodating of different dietary needs, including vegan and gluten free. I presume the other regular menu offerings are also great and would love to come back here for some more bites and drinks!   What's cool about this spot is that at the back there's a cool \"barn-esque area called The Yard, with ping pong and some other games. It gets humid back there in the summer though, but it's a great time and will be even better in the winter!

    "text": "Culinary Dropout is without a doubt one of the coolest vibes in Tempe whether you're looking for a quick lunch bite during the week or a larger group outing in the evening. I love the decor, the service, the menu breadth, and the prices; but when it comes down to the food I think they fall into the 'jack of all trades master of none trap'.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  Again with this much real estate it's near impossible to trump the atmosphere at Culinary Dropout, and the responsive staff keep up with what can be some serious lunch time volumes. Our party of five was tended to wonderfully and the food came out quick once ordered even during a mobbed Friday lunch hour. Star.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  $13.00 for a medium to large sized sandwich is a bit steep in Tempe, but it wasn't unreasonable given what were some solid ingredients and a generous portion of fries. Star.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  I had sky high expectations for my Turkey Pastrami sandwich, I mean, they went so far as to star is on the menu! Maybe it was these expectations that robbed the sandwich of a home run, but I simply didn't think that this was a dish that I couldn't pretty easily replicate after a quick visit to the grocery store.  I was expecting fresh juicy house made turkey pastrami, but whether or not that was the case, it came across as just the standard Boar's Head Cracked Pepper Turkey that you can find anywhere. From there, the pretzel bun didn't impress as much as I thought it would, the the slaw was standard. A good sandwich no doubt, but not a gamechanger in my view. Single Star.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  I like Culinary Dropout, but I'm not sure I could find a dish on the broad menu that couldn't be trumped elsewhere in town. No Star.",

    "text": "I'm a bit indifferent regarding my experience. I'd like to give more stars, but because I stood at the Host station for several minutes before anyone acknowledged my existence made me rate this establishment lower. Although the food increased the rating to the 3 Star because of the superb taste, I was left feeling hungry (I'm a size 2) after due to the small portions.   This placed was packed on a Tuesday night so the wait was 30-45 minutes, but I was able to quickly find seating for 1 at the bar. There were about 5 guys working the massive bar, so no one acknowledged me for several minutes as well. Once I was greeted by a curly hair bearded gentleman he was nice and pleasant. I really wanted to try the Chicken because of all of the high reviews and it seemed hearty for my empty stomach but elected to try the Roasted Salmon instead.   The Roasted Salmon came quick and right away I noticed the the proportions were really small for a $22 plate. Nonetheless, I'm aware that Salmon is costly. It was good in taste and satisfying.   I'd like to give this place another try to improve in service and for the Chicken. A few others near my seat ordered the Chicken; it smelled and looked great plated and I felt that would've fill my stomach.   I'm leaving to go spend money at a nearby eatery because again, I was left with a semi-full stomach.  UPDATE: I had to come back to my review and update all of the Yelp'ers with my Wow experience from Culinary Dropout.   About 2 mins after leaving my initial review, I was politely approached by the GM. I had NO idea that this person was a General Manager as she was the one that helped me after I waited to be acknowledged by the hostess post. Anyway, she immediately apologized for the service I received (I'm still in shock that she even knew who I was, I do not have a picture of myself on my Yelp profile). She also mentioned my review and said she'd like an opportunity to make it right and didn't want me to leave without having an opportunity to make things right with me. She offered the Chicken entree AND another glass of Moscato since I spoke about wanting to try it, at first I declined but after a slight push from her I obliged to the offer.   Not only did I receive the Chicken entree, but another young lady followed up and mentioned how I'm a valued customer and that they really appreciated me giving them the opportunity to make things right for me. Whoa!! I was MORE than taken care of.   I travel a lot for work and this is my 4th time in Tempe in the last 6 months. From Orlando, Virginia, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Philadelphia and Texas to name a few places in the last few months I've never had this type of service!!! I do Trip Advisor reviews, Google reviews, Yelp and even BBB Reviews if it gets really serious and in my business as a Facilitator Consultant in Human Capital Management teaching about Branding is vital to the success on a business and personal level! They have truly branded their service in a newfound way for me.   I will tell everyone and anyone about my experience and incorporate this scenario into my classes when training. I feel valued. I feel special and I feel like I'm more than a customer. All three people I interacted with tonight truly made my day! Shout out to Deven (my bartender)  who told me to \"Pay my Experience\" forward and I will do just that! Thanks Culinary Dropout! I won't forget how you made me feel.    BTW: the Chicken was EVERYTHING! It was so good! I really enjoyed both plates - they were equally delicious!",

I ordered the burger and asked for it medium rare. It was at least medium well. If the restaurant is packed I can look past that, but it was about 40% full.  My wife got the biscuits and gravy with fried chicken. The fried chicken should have been classified as a chicken fried steak. It was pounded so thin I couldn't believe it. The biscuit was a reheated biscuit that was mass produced. I'm thinking it was a Pillsbury biscuit. I don't remember the gravy enough to comment.  My wife's Bloody Mary was honesty one of the worst I've ever had. They tried to make it with bacon and it just tasted very watered down.  We may be back for a drink and bags, but that would be it.",

We live in the Bay Area and have never been to a restaurant quite like this- it's HUGE. Kind of warehouse like but trendy with rustic chic touches. I wish I had taken more photos.  Not sure if it was the excitement of being away for a couple of days without our kids or what but I really dug this spot. There was live music- the singer was AMAZING and covered some great songs, I wish I had caught her name, I'm pretty sure she's going to make it BIG and soon! Culinary Dropout is the perfect date night. Now on to the food.   Since we were still full from our late afternoon lunch, my husband and I ordered two simple salads ($6) and split the Fried Chicken ($17) The fried chicken came with a honey drizzled buttermilk biscuit and mashed potatoes. Our server who was adorable by the way, was so sweet and split the meal up on 2 plates, which was thoughtful, I love that kind of thing when it comes to great service.   We ordered dessert and decided on the Monkey Bread a la mode ($10) This was made to order, it took a really long time to come out, but we hadn't  noticed since we were enjoying the music so much. Our server came out to let us know they burnt our dessert and were making another one. Again, didn't mind and continued on watching that incredible singer preform. The Monkey Bread was hot out of the oven and it was good, but I would definitely try something else next time.  Our server, without prompting, took it upon himself to take the dessert off our check which was really kind and he was super apologetic.  I inappropriately asked him how old he was in hopes of (jokingly) setting him up with my daughter, much to my husband's embarrassment- yeah, I guess I'm turning into that mom, but alas, he turned out to be too old. Lol   If there's one thing I wasn't impressed by it would have to be the cocktails or maybe I just ordered the wrong one- a Coors Light ($5) for the Mister and I ordered the Soiled Dove. ($12)  Now if you've been to the CD you know the bar is legit and tended to by a bunch of Hipsters with big beards and giant mustaches. The Soiled Dove was listed under \"Two Handed Shandies\" and described as Anejo Tequila, blackberry, dragonfruit syrup and black raven grapefruit soda. Sounded pretty fancy to me- what I got was a glass of pink concoction with some muddled blackberries, a fancy blackberry flourish and a small can of Jose Cuervo sparkling Paloma on the side. Which is basically a $2 can of cheapness. Not cool. At first, I was thinking- well maybe it was that mixed in with all the other stuff listed but no, once I refilled my glass it tasted exactly like what was in the can. I guess to be sort of fair they used 2 cans so it was a $4 drink, we paid ($12) for. I do not recommend this cocktail. Lol   Anyhow, so that was disappointing but the rest of the evening was so magical hanging out with my Main Squeeze- without kids, listening to an incredible singer and no worries that it didn't dampen our experience.   * 4 stars for the crappy cocktail rounded to 5 stars for the ambience, live music and great service.",

Being a huge foodie love to try new restaurants. We decided to go here for dinner one evening and the place was I hopping!!! It was a gorgeous night out and the weight flew by while we enjoyed some delicious cocktails. The place is huge and offers games in the back where people can hang out and enjoy their cocktails. When we got to our table the first thing we had to order was the pretzel balls and cheese dip. This is comfort food to the max! And was absolutely delicious. For dinner I decided to go with the ribs which were fall off the bone amazing! One of my friends ordered the meatloaf with the sauces on the side. And my other friend ordered one of their amazing burgers. The overall experience was fantastic we had such a fun time and it really was a great experience. The next time I'm in town I will for sure be back! If you're looking to have a really fun night with friends definitely give this place a try.",

The space is so large and even when there is a big crowd you don't feel crammed into the restaurant, bar, or patio. The back of the patio is a 21+ area with yard games. They have all the usual bar food items but they are more upscale. I like how they use linen napkins, another detail that makes this a more upscale bar. The interior is very unique and a big part of what I love about this place. The couches around the tables and dining room are so inviting.   Enough about the atmosphere... the food is delicious. My favorite item is the fried chicken, and as the menu states, it really is worth the wait! I also suggest getting the monkey bread dessert, you can totally tell it is freshly made. Yum! Good drink prices as well. I have also been here for brunch on the weekends and they serve great Bloody Marys and Mimosas.",

    "text": "Soooooo, I came here with coworkers after a long afternoon's hike through Papago Park/Hole in the Rock, and we were really looking forward to some good eats.  I will say that their service is definitely awesome. We loved our waitress! She was a total sweetheart for our table of 5. However, the food service was a bit lacking. :(  After waiting for something like 45 minutes to be seated (we had no reservations, so I highly recommend that), we finally sat down and took a gander at the menu. Note, we didn't mind the wait since we just hung out at the bar and ordered a few beers.  I ordered the Pretzels and Fondue appetizer for the table so we could share at our waitress' recommendation. Now, it IS tasty, but I didn't think it was anything amaaaazing. It's a heavy app, though, so if you're sharing for a table of, say, two people, you will be stuffed. STUFFED. lol.  The good news is that the P&F app came out swiftly like a coursing river. Unfortunately, our entrees did not come out with all the force of a great typhoon. :( In fact, it took our entrees nearly an HOUR to come out. :( Now, I understand that the kitchen was most likely backed up, but what I don't get is how 2 burgers were no longer hot but cooled down and how my salad (and my coworker's, since we ordered the same Butternut Squash & Kale salad) had missing items... namely the pecans, goat cheese, and a mere sprinkling of brussel sprouts.   So yeah, pretty sad about the salad, though our waitress was quick to run to the kitchen to get the missing items. The salad was delish besides the wait, but I felt bad for my table-mates who were digging into cool burgers. :/ That, coupled with the super long wait was no bueno.  I give this an AOK however due to our awesome waitress, the yummy salad despite everything else, awesome atmosphere and sweet bartenders. Also, they have cornhole and ping pong, which we *should have* utilized during our long wait, haha.",

Service was incredibly slow -- staff seemed overwhelmed but still found time to congregate and talk in the corners rather than serve customers.   All three plates of food came out luke warm and we had to remind the server about the third plate we were missing - I took this to mean that the kitchen staff was doing okay but the waitress forgot about us since the food was all late and the same temperature, rather than one plate being hot and the rest only warm, which would indicate a kitchen mistake.   We didn't get silverware or napkins until halfway through our meal, nor were we offered water until 2/3 people finished our meals. We sent back one plate because it was cold, then the waitress charged us twice for it which we then had to wait to be fixed.   The couple sitting across from us left before us but their dishes weren't bussed for 20 minutes and the table we sat down at had crumbs from the last party.   We frequently saw staff congregating in the corners and drinking canned beverages while talking, meanwhile there are dirty tables all over the place, food getting cold, and people waiting for checks.   This was the second time at this location, a year apart since we're from out of town. First time we thought it was just a fluke but after the second, not even the good cocktails can make up for the extremely poor service. I work in the service industry so I try not to nit-pick because I know how hard the job can be -- but this was unacceptable. Seems to be very little communication between staff about what needs to be done. Seems like they need a floor manager to help keep things running smoothly.",

    "text": "My wife and I met her cousin and his wife for lunch on Saturday, January 9, 2016.  This was a very neat place!  There was indoor seating, but we decided to sit \"outside\" in a patio area.  The area was covered overhead, but was open air.  The outside temperature was very cool and the area that we sat in was equipped with over heaters as well as fire pits.  The seating selections were tables, booths, and then some sofa type lounges surrounding the fire pits.  The restaurant had some great local brews on tap.  I ordered a Kilt Lifter from Four Peaks Brewing (Tempe, AZ) and a Dale's Pale Ale from Oskar Blues Brewery (Longmont, CO).  Both were served very chilled and went down smooth!  For lunch, I went with Butternut Squash Cannelloni.  The plate was served with mushrooms, smoked shallot, caramelized fennel, parmesan, and herb butter.  Inside the cannelloni was a butternut squash puree, and then there were chunks of very tender butternut squash served on top.  This entree was absolutely delightful!!!  There were so many flavors going on with each bite, I was in Heaven!  My wife ordered the Turkey Pastrami sandwich which she said was very good.  It must have been, because she finished the entire sandwich!  Great place, great location, great food, and great beer!  This place was a hit!",

The later was OK but unfortunately the food fell short.  I had the ribs they were served cold and clearly made with no seasoning where they expected the sauce to do all that after they were cooked.  The sauce did have good flavor but not enough to make up for the poor prep of the ribs. The sides were also nothing special.  My son had the pork belly nachos.  The pork was just regular old shredded pork and the cheese sauce was just that... a sauce.  Possibly Velveeta.  Pork belly when cooked well can be quite tasty but shredded pork is not pork belly. There is a good drink selection and fun games to play if you like that sort of thing.  Overall the food was average but not enough to recommend to others.",

    "text": "To start we called for a group of 14 and they said they did not take reservations.  OK I can live with that but when we get there and ask for a table we get an answer that there is a 2 hr wait for a table for that big a group so we say how about 2 tables of 7.  Still an 1 hour and 15 min wait.  Some of our group say \"not interested\" in waiting that long so we end up with 9 left.  We go to wait at the bar and the bar tenders are less than friendly although we are running a tab and consuming quite a bit of alcohol!  After 40 minutes we see a table of 8 cleared and set but it's not for us but only 4 people sit down.  WTF???  After another 30 minutes I get incensed as there are still only 4 people at that table and our group of 9 are still waiting!  I go to the front desk and talk to some person with a \"beret\" on (who I guess is the general manager) and let him know my frustration and he gives me some BS about reservations and they take them but they were booked a week ago blah, blah, blah...  I ask him about the table of 8 with only 4 people at it and I get  more BS about they seat people when half there group there and they are drinking... blah, blah, blah .... what about my group of 9 who where drinking at the bar and generating more revenue than the 4 people at the table.  So we finally get our table after an hour and 20 mins.  We are not exactly happy campers.  The servers were very nice though.  I asked to talk to a manager and another gentleman comes over to talk to us.  He is very nice and listens and apologizes for our inconvenience and even buys us a round of drinks.  OK a peace offering.  But he says that their food is the \"best around\" and my response is we'll have to see about that.   I ordered the Korean steak and it was good- I make this myself so it wasn't over the top  but good.  My friend ordered the same as I medium rare but his came out well done except for a single piece. Last another person in the group ordered a burger med rare and it was well done - they did bring another burger that was cooked properly.  The food was good - not extraordinary.  The front desk crew also wasn't very cordial.  Lastly their general manager was a \"Richard\"....",

Many menu items were identical and in a tragic twist of fate, less tasty than I remembered.   Our service was lackluster. The server was either overwhelmed or just not interested in her job that night.   The pretzel fondue was great. The chicken gorgonzola salad lacked both the meat and cheese it promised to deliver.

So beautiful!! Right when we walked in we were greeted with many smiles and hellos! We got sat and about 1min later our server came by she was so friendly she asked if we have ever been here before and we told her only the Scottsdale one and she smiled and said \"well I'm glad you two came to Tempe today, we are known to have a the best looking staff\" haha it was funny then told her I needed a good summer cocktail! She immediately got down next to me and asked me what flavors I like and which liquor I prefer. She recommended \"The Soild Dove\" WOW best tequila cocktail iv ever had. Then we obviously got the pretzels. I orders a salad and my boyfriend the pub burger but half way through our meals the power shut off.... most restaurants people freak out but the staff was so calm. Which made us calm! Tiffany came over to reassure us everything was fine even cracked a joke so made us not worry to much. But the power did come back on! By the end of our meal she asked us if we need some deserts we originally didn't but she sold us on the \"Smores pudding\" and that definitely hit the spot!!! I really can't wait to bring my friends here! The staff is so great! They all help each other and we noticed that! The food is amazing! And the atmosphere is fun! Five stars for Culinary Tempe!",

Then the real kicker hostess comes up and tells us we have to leave pretty much right now as they needed the table for another party.   There were like 50 to 60 empty chairs in the restaurant.

We asked for a table inside, and the dining room was pretty empty.  We were told we had to sit outside because the servers on staff had too many tables already.  Ooooh k.  So we sat outside and it was hot and humid and gross.  Our party grew to about 8 and the waiter ran our first drink orders and apps, then said he was leaving and closed us out, and another waiter would come by to serve us.  It was 6:30pm, we were ready for new drinks and dinner but no one ever came.  My bf went in and told the bar.... 15 minutes later still nothing.  So he went in again and told he hostess.  She finally came out and told a waitress who'd been standing around bored for an hour to serve us.  It's now 7:45 and everyone's done waiting so we said never mind and left.  Crappy.",

I came in the afternoon on a Saturday and didn't have any of the service issues that other reviews have mentioned, but could understand with such a huge place how on crowded nights, it could slow a bit.  Still, being surrounded by such cool ambiance, I would find it hard to find something to complain about as once you get your food and drinks, you'll love it here. Especially with fire pits and outdoor couches, it's a comfortable place for big parties and a great happy hour location. I would highly recommend checking this place out if you're in the area.",

My only complaint about my experience was that the wait staff had no identity. None of them were wearing name tags nor did they have an official uniform. But that did  not take away from good service. Was just an observation.  Now to the food. I ordered the fried chicken. It says on the menu that it is worth the wait. Well I really didnt wait that long. Out came a plate with 3 pieces or perfectly cooked chicken, accompanied by mashed potatoes, cole slaw and a very fresh biscuit. Everything was great. The batter on the chicken was crispy and flavorful. There may even be some cumin in there. And I did order some dessert to go...the bourbon black bottom pie. I cant give a review because I haven't tried it yet.  Definitely a great experience. Also, from a male perspective, between the female staff and other females dining at the place there are a lot of things to look at. Including the tv's.  I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "UPDATE: based on my original Yelp review we were invited back to try it again. This time our sever was Manu who was amazing! My overall theme in the original review was the food wasn't necessarily the freshest. This time I got the prime rib dip sandwich with mushrooms and jalapenos. The sand which was one of the best prime rib dips I've ever had.  The dip was super flavorful without being too salty. The prime rib was tender and delicious. My girl got the sweet corn ravioli with prosciutto, which was recommended by our waiter Manu and that turned out to be amazingly tender and so flavorful. I can't stress enough how gracious and attentive the staff was and how good the food was this time. I've updated my rating to reflect my new experience which is more in line with the recommendations I've previously gotten. I would definitely recommend this in the future and I will be back for that sandwich.   ------------------------------------------------  The restaurant itself is very nice. The staff was great and our server Kael was awesome. That's the good. Now the bad. We ate there on the last night of restaraunt week and decided to do their special. My girl ordered the steak tacos and I got the fried chicken. On the menu the chicken says it takes longer but is worth the wait. I'm not sure why I didn't take a pic of the chicken. I just didn't think about it. It did not take longer than her tacos and when it came out it was extra greasy and lukewarm. Additionally there were spots in the chicken where it wasn't battered at all. When I tried it besides being lukewarm it wasn't seasoned very well. The steak tacos we ordered were decent but again did not taste fresh, like maybe they had not been cooked fresh or something. The corn tortillas were brittle and dry and like the chicken lukewarm. I've had a lot of people tell me the food is great here but that wasn't our experience this time. As it is I could not recommend this place. Very trendy, kinda pricey and food wasn't great.",

The salads were fresh and dressed perfectly, not drenched, allowing you to taste the fresh and balanced toppings. Definitely try the Italian chopped for a savory blend.  The meatloaf is a comfort food made with quality ingredients and full of flavor. A little more upscale than grandma makes it but not lacking the True American spirit of meatloaf. Turkey pastrami is hard to find and they clearly get it right here both on the sandwich and the salads. The charcuterie is a must, they do not lack in quality on the meats or cheeses. Drinks are unique, well balanced and refreshing. I recommend trying one of their house cocktails topped with beer or champagne.   Service was better than average, the staff isn't overly friendly but they get the job done.",

    "text": "Update - May 9, 2017 - I just had dinner and was blown away with the place, the food, and the service.  They far exceeded my expectations and for a very busy Tuesday night during A.S.U. graduation they did a great job seating us and making sure we were pleased with everything.  I want to thank the GM and her staff.  It is good to see that Sam is letting his employees run his business like they should be run.  I will be back to any of the Fox restaurants after tonight's experience.    Like with most of the Sam Fox restaurants the place is lovely inside.  The menu is good and the food is fine.  The issue I have with this place and several other Sam Fox restaurants is the service.  My last visit to this location my experience started by getting the wrong size beer from the bartender, no big deal he was nice about it and changed it out for me.  The rest of my party arrived so I closed out with the bartender and he did not correct the bill for my drink.  It took me at least 15 minutes to get his attention, if it were busy I would have no issue with this time frame but it was not busy at all.  He was too busy talking with his other workmates.  When I got his attention he was able to correct his error and brought me the correct tab.  It took another 15 minutes for him to come over and pick up the cash I put out to cover the bill.  He was quick to bring my change back to me however he brought the incorrect change back.  After 20 minutes waiting to point out the error I decided the four dollars was not worth my time with my friends and family that were now waiting for me at a table.  Once I got to the table for dinner the rest of the evening was okay but still slow.  Also, I'm not sure if the staff is trained to show no emotion or not but my gosh at least pretend that you are happy to be there.  This what I will call attitude for lack of a better word seems to permeate several of the Fox Group restaurants.  I would love to give this place a better review but my experience was not a good one.  Maybe next time I will be able to update this review with a better experience.",

    "text": "Noisy ambiance with hard surfaces, loudish music, and cavernous spaces.decibels reading via my phone was 85, and this was on a Tuesday late Lunch.  Uninspired menu. We had difficulty choosing what we wanted to eat, not because there were many options, but because there were so few. Little that could be called healthy eating, our impression was that this was a young mans restaurant. One of us had the cannelloni, which was good. Tomato, asparagus and shallot in a butter sauce with Parmesan. Another had the kale and sweet corn salad. Mostly kale with tiny amounts of roasted cauliflower, snap peas (2), avocado, almonds, goat cheese. It was suppose to have roasted beets, but I never found them. Dressing was bland and unremarkable. Our third had the BBQ pork belly nachos. Interesting\"chips\" with a little pork belly, a nice amount of guacamole, some salty black beans, covered with a glutenous cheese sauce that weighed down everything and contributed to a general sogginess after about 5 minutes.   Servers near us were dressed in short shorts - lace or leather, contributing to a hooters- like atmosphere. Service was good, however.  Parking is challenging, a short trek across a dirt drive. About half a city block. Only one handicap spot near the door that we can see. Grateful we didn't need it.  Food was pricey for what you got - not worth it",

I also really enjoyed my cocktail, El Matador.  What was even better than the food was the service I received especially from the bartender and the manager. My experience here made my extended layover much more bearable!",

The Bbq pork belly nachos was awesome and the cole slaw that came with the fish and chips was the best I've tasted. The batter of the fish was drenched with oil and the fries were a little too over cooked. We were looking forward to the pretzel bites with the fondue cheese. That came to our table cold, once the candle lit the cheese  the pretzel became more dense from being cold. The server was attentive and the place was pretty packed for a Sunday. We will try this place again, looks like a great place to have a few drinks and snack on some appetizers.",

I have also had the burgers here before and they were very good. This trip I have the pork belly nachos and my friend had so kind of curry. We both were happy with our choices. This is not the cheapest place but if you don't mind spending a couple extra bucks the food quality, service and atmosphere are worth it",

A very pleasant surprise. If you're in Tempe I highly recommend Culinary Dropout.",

Gazing at food as it glides past in servers arms or through the windows to the kitchen - which give a full view of meal preparation with the final plating and assembly taking place closest to the observer.  The Brussels sprouts were lovely, and can be subbed as a side when ordering a sandwich or main dish. My meatloaf was tasty although I'll admit I had fish and chips and salmon salad envy after watching dining companions enjoy theirs.  Nice touch - if you order a meal to share, the wait staff brings it out on two plates.  Of interest for return visits - do it yourself starter combos with choices ranging from cheese to meat to pickled items to crusty bread.  This not a restaurant for quiet conversation. It is, however, a restaurant for flavor and aesthetics. Those who wait will be rewarded.  Free valet parking for diners in adjacent lot.",

    "text": "After arriving in Arizona earlier in the day, my dad and I were eager to try out a new restaurant. We made our way down to the Culinary Dropout after reading several great reviews about this place. Instantly, we were greeted with smiling faces by some very welcoming individuals. Because we arrived at 4, there wasn't much of a crowd, but there was still a lot of people in the restaurant. The Culinary Dropout itself, is huge, very roomy, with many tables, bar seats, and even separate rooms for parties. The vibe is very hipster and cool, with string lights hanging from the rooftop. There is the restaurant, and also the patio. The patio is covered, so it's not too hot, and even has misters to help keep the area cool. On the patio, they have a gaming area, including ping pong, a version of shuffleboard, and corn hole. My dad and I tested our skills in ping pong, where we had the time of our lives. Our waitress was calm, cool, and collected, and made my dad and I feel at home.   Now, for the food. The steak tacos were easily the greatest things I have ever placed in my mouth. The presentation was beautiful, and the tacos had an underlying sweetness to them. As much as I tried to savor them, I ate all three tacos within minutes. My dad described the seared tuna salad as phenomenal. The tuna was seared to perfection on the edges, and the middle was very rare and juicy. The portion size was great, and they did not skimp out on the tuna. To top it off, we ordered the s'mores pudding desert. It was absolutely incredible. The marshmallow on top was fluffy, and the caramel in the middle wasn't overtaking, and the chocolate pudding at the bottom was smooth. Graham crackers came along with it, and we tried our hardest to not think about how many calories this desert was. It was very rich, and could be split between 2-4 people. Overall, we had a very fun time, and will definitely come back.",

The back feels like a college bar with cornhole and ping pong games going on, and the inside feels like a gastropub with some live cover bands. Great vibes.  The unfortunate part is the wait time. Both times was over an hour!  Make a reservation!  Food:  It was average. Not bad, not amazing.  I'll Chalk it up to what we ordered. My wife had the chicken club, and she said it wasn't the best or worst she's had. I had eyes bigger than my stomachache and thought I'd love to try the M.A.C.  Obviously their play off of the Macdonald 2 all beef patties special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onion on a sesame seed bun.  And if you are going to go after a burger that is that famous, I think you have to nail it. My burger was well done and it tasted like the idea of a Big Mac but didn't blow me away. I will suggest the pierogis!  Potato and cheese. I didn't snap a pic but they were goood!  Drinks: This was our favorite part. Great beer selection! It looked like they had fun cocktails too but we didn't partake. A+ on selection of brews.   Service/overall:  The bartenders were awesome. Probably 4 of them and they all helped us equally like we were all of their customers. Great/fast service.  We will be back next spring training for round 3 and to try some different dishes. And we will make a reservation!",

My friends, nor clients, nor I, have ever gone wrong with anything we have ordered here. The drinks are always top notch and the food has always been delicious.   Whether you're here with a group or just a few friends it provides food, drinks, and an atmosphere that is sure to delight. It's like going to a bar with your friends in a high end living room with a game room right next to it. Enjoy it all and make it a common stop for you and your crew.",

Completely blown away by the interior set up and design. The actual entrance is connected to a small boutique called Madison's--super expensive clothing with simple athleisuere style. (While the clothes are cute, I don't think I can pay $58 for a tank). Anyway, follow the hallway to find a corridor that leads you to an open, transparent kitchen and a cool, upscale restaurant. Completely open concept, industrial, and artsy.   Patrons were young business professionals, older important people in suits, families brunching together, and then me...day drinking on my day off with messy hair. This is definitely not the bar or restaurant you go to for cheap drinks to find life's answers at the bottom of the bottle. It definitely has a classy feel.   Stage in the restaurant has live music with the upcoming acts listed on the giant blackboard. The Yard is connected and is the gaming area. 21 and over only in that section.  Service was good. Food was good, drink menu was awesome! Prices were decent, but on the higher side overall. Definitely recommend this place to impress a date or a fun girls night out when you're in the mood to get dolled up.",

Waited over 15 minutes just for our greet, and around 20 just for waters and our bottle of wine. The food came before the drinks. Sat there even longer waiting to cash out.   Tonight I was so excited to try it out and give it another shot but that did not work. Understandably there was a wait so my boyfriend and I went and sat at the bar to get a drink while we waited. We sat there and the bartenders walked past us and made eye contact. Every time they passed by. No \"hi, how are you?\" Or \"I'll be with you in just a moment\". Walking past us multiple times with out acknowledging us made us feel extremely unwelcome there. We decided that it was best for us to leave and go somewhere else after waiting 15 minutes.  I definitely will not return and if you plan on going expect amazing food but slow and awful service.",

    "text": "While visiting Arizona, my friends told me that we HAD to go to Culinary Dropout. Two steps into the restaurant and I understood why - this place is gorgeous!  We don't see ever see this huge of restaurants in the Bay Area due to space restrictions. Culinary Dropout was really big and airy with a variety of seating spread throughout (bar, regular tables, table tops, etc.) Didn't feel claustrophobic at all, but rather, very relaxed!  [FOOD] ~ Korean-style Brussels Sprouts: Perfection. Crispy with a delicious spicy/sweet flavor. I would eat this every damn day if I could. ~ Pretzels & Fondue: My friends ordered this and let me try one. Don't think I could ask for pretzels to be cooked any better. The cheese wasn't as amazing (tasted a smidge like \"fake\" cheese), but that still didn't stop me from drowning my entire pretzel into the sauce. ~ Mussels: Great flavor, but very sandy which was a bit of an annoyance while eating. ~ Beer in a bag: For around $2, you get a surprise can of beer that is not on the menu. Such a cute and cheeky idea, so of course I had to give it a whirl. Ended up getting a random beer that I've never seen before, and by no means was it amazing - but hey, it was a nice way to wash down my pretzels and an overall fun idea.  [SERVICE]: Our server was super friendly and definitely added to our enjoyable experience. The only minor comment I have to make is that our table ordered 2 portions of the Pretzels & Fondue. Only one came out first while the second took another 5-10 minutes. It was awkward considering these orders were not meant to be shared with the entire table, but to the specific people that ordered them. Not sure why they couldn't have just waited to bring the first one out at the same time as the second one.  All in all, I loved Culinary Dropout. From the wonderful ambiance, to the quirky menu and food - I'm sold!",

Great music pumping through the speakers, sports on the TV's, lots of college students hanging out. So very friendly waiters and staff. The Culinary Dropout is on the ASU campus.  There is a trolley stop just outside the restaurant.  Truly one of the better feel good restaurants I've had the pleasure of trying. I can only imagine at night or after a game. I'd bet this place is so alive.  Our meals were top notch as well. My potato and cheese Perogies with charred brussel sprouts in a lemon creme fresh sauce was amazing.  I can't wait to come back.",

The food is a little pricey but definitely delicious! I got the pretzels and beer cheese as my meal  (I know, kinda weird) and was pleasantly surprised. I've had soft pretzels other places that just taste like bread, but this place knows how to make them right! It came with seriously like 10 big pretzels and a side of hot cheese dip (which didn't taste at all like beer to me). We came on a Saturday night so the wait was like 45 mins but ended up only having to wait like 25 mins...which is always nice! The server was super nice and helpful. At one point I ordered a green cocktail (one with jalapeno and cilantro) which I didn't end up liking, and the server took it back and didn't charge us! I opted for a sour beer and fruity cocktail instead! Love this place.",

I called 3 days beforehand and luckily I was able to get a 6:45p appointment.   Food and Atmosphere is top notch. We ordered the pierorgies for appetizers and it was the best. Our first time having pierorgies and we love them now. They were perfectly steamed and then fried a little too give them a bit of crunch. The accoutrements were divine. I wish there were four instead of three for better sharing. For entrees, rainbow trout and the butternut squash \"ravioli.\" I appreciated the trout was pan seared and not breaded. It was a good size too. I subbed the greens beans for brussel sprouts because I was not interested in the typical green bean almondine. They did it. The pasta was good, not too sweet as butternut squash can be sometimes.   Where the service started fumbling was at the dessert course. The desserts provided are short-listed and to me not really appetizing. I had to get creative and thought about a cheese dessert course. I would think a restaurant that shines a light on its cheese and antipasti would know how to dessert up a cheese. Unfortunately no. The jam provided was sparse and after asking twice for some fruit, my date had to go to the bar and ask for a cup of strawberries. Also, no silverware was provided, and when it was it was a big dinner spoon. It was awkward.  Honorable mention for the live music and some yard games in the back. Also, the dress code was casual with a sprinkle of dressy.  Overall, my date and I were pleased with the experience. V-day, check",

Had to be 200 people here. It's huge. One area has couches around fire pits. Corn hole, ping pong, table shuffleboard. I mean how cool is that.   The food was fantastic. Kale salad, cornbread, ribs...get em. Just sayin'.  The staff was as friendly a group as I've ever seen. All of them were friendly and always there with speedy service and a smile.   They had about 12 beers on tap, great choices to. When you have Deschutes, you're ok in my book.   And the prices. Holy crap. I thought they forgot to add a few things.    You need to go here.

So since we are on the topic of pretzels,  I start by saying all of the dishes here are amazing!   Good quality food with unique takes that just ups the bar on stand comfort food.  And  yes the pretzels are as amazing as they were described to me.   The cheese sauce was tantalizing!  I just wanted more.   So we also had the nachos which came with the exact same cheese sauce and delicious pork belly.   The chips were really good also.   I feel like all items were fresh and came out fast.    The service was good,  although it took a while for the first round of beer to come out.   The food came out before the beer.  But this place was very packed.  I love the fun vibe of this place.   There was ample outdoor seating and outdoor games like ping pong.   Although it was pretty warm when I went,  it looks like you could go and have a meal outside year around due to all the heaters present.   Overall I can wait to return when I'm in this city again!",

Truth be told, I was intrigued by the name of this place, but was even more impressed by the ambience and definitely the food.    The space was huge and can be overwhelming, so we headed to the bar where full service and immediate access to cocktails await us.  To beat the heat, we immediately ordered a couple of refreshing cocktails and was completely satisfied by the pomegranate yuzu mule --- refreshing!  But what really did it for me was the \"after school special\" -  a concoction made with raspberry tea infused tequila, homemade ginger agave, lime, and modelo especial.    The menu did not disappoint either.  We started with the prosciutto deviled eggs (delish), and the completely addicting cheddar cracklins!  My entree choice may appear to be plain but I can assure you there was nothing basic about the shrimp kale caesar salad that I completely inhaled, and my cannot-be-impressed husband said that the turkey pastrami sandwich was served on the best pretzel bread he'd ever had - [mic drop]!    We loved it so much that we returned for brunch on our last day in AZ but at Phoenix location.  There are several locations in the area but you never forget your first love so it will have to be Tempe for me :)",

You instantly feel more hip and fun once you cross the threshold. It feels expensive but casual. Put together but not trying to hard.  For lunch, I had the grilled cheese sliders and fries. Once the server told me that everything was homemade, I knew a side of Ranch had to happen. Trust me...when things are homemade, you always get the Ranch. My meal was delicious. The bread was buttery but had a crunch that resulted  in crumbs all over me. The cheese was melty and delicious, and the tomato...well, it made me feel better about myself, I suppose. The fries were great and the Ranch...man, I could talk about it all day.  My server, Janelle, was super busy but attentive and offered lots of suggestions. The only bad thing about this place is that I'm not here with my friends to enjoy it! Great place. Excited to come back next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "***This Culinary Dropout has a great look (it takes up residence in a modern warehouse) and the flavors were there too; unfortunately, the food on hot courses was lukewarm to cold, which hurt the overall experience***  There is a string of Culinary Dropout restaurants throughout the Phoenix area. This gastropub features a variety of classic dishes like meatloaf, fish and chips, fried chicken, and more. The preparations are contemporary, but they are also fairly straight-up and safe. A few more globally inspired dishes like Korean style beef and ramen also appear on the menu.   I started with the soft pretzel bites with provolone cheese fondue. This was fairly good though there is a gastropub at the Wigwam serving a superior version. The preparation at Culinary Dropout is satisfying enough with a good pretzel crust on the bites and a creamy cheese fondue, but the pretzel bites were quite big (which results in a lot of bread that diminishes the impact of the salted pretzel crust) and the cheese fondue was not hot enough (in terms of temperature and not spiciness).   For my entree, I had the Korean style ribeye cap and the quality of beef was very noticeable. With ribeye cap, you get the interior of a ribeye but a more distinct exterior like hanger steak. This allows the kitchen to achieve a far superior and more crispy crust than a regular ribeye and that is exactly what happened here. The interior was juicy, tender and flavorful while the outside had a nice crispy char. The Korean marinade, thankfully, was not too spicy and thus did not overpower the natural flavor of the steak.   The garnishes were also cooked appropriately as the onions, mushrooms, zucchini, and bean sprouts were sauteed to the right texture. Unfortunately, everything on the plate was lukewarm to even slightly cold. This plate definitely sat a little too long on the pass.   Service was very friendly and the food came out at a quick pace. However, both lukewarm to cold food for both starter and entree was worrisome.   Prices were reasonable though prices for food in the Phoenix area tend to be more reasonable than other big city restaurants.   This Culinary Dropout has a great look. It is located in a big and new looking warehouse complex that houses several upscale and modern restaurants. The industrial look combined with the variety of seating and even lawn style games creates a lively and energetic atmosphere. Unfortunately, I felt the restaurant was slightly uncomfortable as the seating was a tad stiff and the room temperature was too warm (which was surprising; I thought the room would have been more drafty than warm given its warehouse location).   This Culinary Dropout near ASU has a great look and the menu serves fairly good food. However, the lukewarm and cold food worries me that guests may have a truly poor experience here from time to time. If you live in the area, this gastropub is worth trying considering the food quality and reasonable prices though I would suggest giving them a shot at a non-peak time.   This restaurant has a free parking lot. Complimentary valet is also available.",

This is honestly one of the best dining experiences I've EVER had in AZ, even after attending ASU and living in Tempe for 4 years!   To begin with, the atmosphere is unbeatable. Parking isn't the best but we lucked out with a spot!!The building is huge and one of the only \"bar\" scenes I've been to in Tempe that isn't cramped, a million degrees and smelly. Not in the slightest. It's decorated industrial chic and has bulb lights strung all over. The space is very large and well-cooled (even on an 85+ degree night) and there are I think 3 bars!? There are ping pong tables and corn hole and a few spots to sit and enjoy your appetizers and drinks. Even a live band came on (and they waited until the final 4 was over to bring them out which I highly appreciated). We waited about 40 min for a table but with the above factors it wasn't bad at all. They text you when your table is ready which I also appreciated vs having to hold on to one of those annoying buzz things. The table we were sat at was very spacious, had super comfy giant chairs and good views of the basketball on TV.   The server was totally hipster but very nice and speedy! Everything on the menu looked awesome and it was hard to choose. We had the pretzel bites as an appetizer ... They were good! I ordered the steak and potatoes for dinner - it was cooked PERFECTLY and was seriously amazing. My boyfriend ordered ribs which he loved and my two friends each got salads that looked awesome. For dessert we got the monkey bread which was perfectly shareable!   I will 100% be returning here for dinner EVERY time I'm in AZ!",

    "text": "I only went here once because I had a $75 worth of Fox Restaurant gift cards and this is the only place in Tempe... I think. Anyways, I decided to take my parents here for a nice, relaxing Saturday lunch... Not what I experienced.  We arrived and the server sat us right in front of a \"band\" playing music. It was waaaay too loud. I requested to move across the room immediately which they accommodated. I think they were ticked off though because our server checked up on us like once the entire time we were there until the last 10 minutes when we paid. No water refills...  We ordered mussels, their oft-posted pretzel appetizer, butternut squash ravioli, and steak. The steak was overlooked for a medium steak without much flavor, the pretzel rolls were too salty, even after we brushes off all the salt on the outside of the roll. That compounded with no water refill and we were barely able to eat them. The mussels were also overlooked so they were really tough and the sausage that was supposed to be in the mussels were like specks, about the size of crumbs. Highly misleading.   The one redeeming dish was the ravioli. It was slightly sweet with aromatic hints and well balanced. Nice dish.  The whole meal used up the $75 gift card but the one item I liked was the ravioli. My parents had one comment which I thought was funny. They said, \"We're glad it was free. The Red Lobster place was better.\" Hah! They know an overpriced, sadly lacking in taste meal as well as any foodie out there!  I only went there once. Maybe there normal cook was out sick. I don't know but I can't think of a reason to come back...",

We had to get lucky to get our own table in the open seating area on the patio. It was a really nice area though. Lawn games. TVs with sports. Fun \"living room\" seating areas for groups to sit on couches in a circle.   I ordered the meatloaf and it was PHENOMENAL. So tender and the mashed potatoes that came with it were so creamy and rich.   As for beer, I got a Deschutes Black. They have a decent selection of beers but not a whole lot of them are on tap, so don't be expecting a yardhouse selection.   Overall fun and tasty but loud and busy.",

The food was delicious; my mother and I shared the Caesar salad and the chicken club and it was a great portion for sharing. My sister enjoyed the sliders that had perfectly ripe tomatoes and crispy bacon with melted cheese, and my grandmother had the soup of the day.  Our server, who I just forgot his name but he wears a black top hat and has a little longer hair. He was phenomenal! Perfect mix of professionalism and personality, he was very knowledgeable on the menu. I wouldn't be surprised if he was also a manager or lead server of some sort.  Highly recommend coming in and enjoying a nice lunch here!",

They seated the 2 of us at a table nearest the host stand which I was worried might be high traffic and annoying, but it was actually a great vantage point for people watching.    Our server came by and was very friendly and informative as this was our first visit.  We ordered a starter that was a \"build-your-own\" type of snack menu.  Ours was spreadable chorizo, herbed goat cheese & grilled crostini.  Nice flavors and perfect starter portion.  Entrees were the Sweet Corn Canneloni and the Roasted Salmon.  Both were DEE-licious!!   All in all, great experience.  Can't wait to go back for more!",

The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is that there was a 45 minute to and an hour long wait to be seated and it was pretty loud.  With that being said, we weren't in a rush and enjoyed the fun and hip atmosphere! There are also yard games - corn hole, ping pong, etc. that you could play while you wait! If you don't like to wait, I would recommend making a reservation or coming early!  The food was delicious and probably one of the best meals I had while visiting Tempe! I had the Kale salad, my husband had the Turkey Rueben, and our friend had the corn ravioli! So good!  If you like great food, a fun atmosphere, and tasty drinks then this is the place for you!!!",

The 3-stars rating is due to the low customer service. There's just too many people to receive any kind of minimal, acceptable level of customer service.   The servers staff would benefit if they could spend more time with the people there supposed to be taking care of.   If you sit at the bar, pick the inside section.

Parking was decent and even though we made a reservation, I doubt the wait would not have been too bad by the time we all gathered around 12. We shared the pretzel bites and cheese, definitely will order again. Then I ordered the salmon avocado toast, for $13. I don't usually have avocado toast but I love salmon so I was excited for it, but the portion of protein was ridiculously small. I could have gone to Einstein's, ordered a nova lox and gotten more salmon served to me for less. I ordered the lipstick and earrings as a drink and it was okay, a bit more savory than I was expecting for something that has orange juice and berries. Our service was great, but having been to enough locally owned restaurants, I wouldn't say what your paying matches to the portions. Maybe stick to the apps and a drink to share rather than pay for a full meal here.",

    "text": "Snore. If you have three of the same restaurants, at least try and do something different at each one (besides ping pong). So, once you go to one Fox place, there is no incentive to visit any other. Additionally, Happy Hour has been slashed to only 3-5pm? This decision eliminates serving HH to the people who deserve it most - people who work until 5pm. It is a pretty dramatic increase in food prices when HH ends, but plenty of cheap beers still abound.They have House beer ( a can) or PBR for 3 bucks or a bagged mystery beer for 2 bucks, so it's a decent place for cheap drinks. Also, please hire a female bartender, having eight bearded males prowling the bar is a bit too much testosterone for myself.",

    "text": "First, let me say, I am so happy to have Culinary Dropout open in Tempe in the Farmer Arts District. I think it is going to be an  anchor establishment for lots of other development in this area and talk about a well run establishment, wow, one can almost hear the hum of operational efficiency in how this place is run and it is a big space and so popular! I took my work-team to lunch here today and honestly, no detail is overlooked and I have no doubt that in going here folks will have a consistently positive experience.  As for why it is only marked as A-Ok right now - well, my first time at this location and as with the other culinary dropout I find the food to be good but nothing, at least this time, sent me into foodie heaven. I got the fried chicken and while it was good, a bit sweet for me for some reason. Part of the reason may be that I had the Asian fusion style fried chicken from Welcome Chicken + Donuts the day before and it suffered a bit by comparison. Probably the big thing, the mashed potatoes come across as a bit too smooth - something like mashed new potatoes, done a bit thicker, would be a bit more in alignment with the sort of stomach grabbing mashed potatoes that complement fried chicken - same for the gravy, feels as bit too smoothed out versus say, a thicker gravy with a stronger component of black pepper.   I will say that the sweet potato cannelloni one of fellow diners had was well received and someone else had the M.A.C. burger and said it was one of her top five burgers. Accordingly, I bet most folks will find the food good enough. If one is a bit more of a foodie I would look to the antipasti menu where one can pick a variety of cured meets, cheeses (including pimento cheese - yum!) and other snacks - I saw some boards of those going out and they looked delicious.   Oh, the music was at a low (good volume) when my group sat down for lunch at 11:15 and then as things started to get packed, they cranked up the volume - I have a feeling that is meant to help keep things moving quickly or even more likely, I'm becoming a grouchy old guy but keeping music at a reasonable level so that it adds to the ambiance but does not overwhelm or overshadow the level of conversation seems important.   Key point here, a Yelp review is deeply personal and to some degree we have to throw in a level of \"it connected with me\" as a diner so that is why it is a  three star - I don't hate it but I also don't go - wow, that was an uncommonly good eating experience - I'll make sure to go back a few times and see if things change as I try more things on the menu, including some of the house cocktails - at the end of the day I'm extremely happy to have this establishment in my neighborhood.  P.S. - one thing that was amazing, the apple monkey bread with ice cream dessert -  that was amazing and worth getting again. :-)",

I was not able to make them online for the same time though, so try calling them if you are denied online.   My lunch was delicious (I had the strawberry & kale salad with chicken) and everyone I was with seemed to enjoy their food. I did not have any, but the pretzel bites appetizer was a big hit at our table as well.   The place was fairly crowded, probably because of ASU graduations, and it made our wait time to get our meals pretty long. Someone other than our server (a manager perhaps) came over to our table at one point and apologized for the long wait.   The food was really good though. So if you've got the ability to take a long lunch, I definitely recommend this place. A little pricey for an everyday lunch spot, but this was a work lunch, so it worked well for us.",

I ordered the ribs, the chicken sandwich and the burger as a group with 2 of my friends and not a single one of us liked any of the dishes, we spent over $120 worth and decided to stop by Dunkin doughnuts on the way home because we were still hungry. The ribs were extremely salty, the chicken in my sandwich was dry and tough (almost like a tire) and the burger was basically like a hockey puck. The hostesses are your typical ASU gorgeous college students and the ambience is cool too, but the wait staff have no idea what they were serving. I asked \"can you bring me something hoppy, anything IPA like?\" The server brought out a porter/stout and then when I said this isn't very hoppy or pale he came back with something which tasted like a budlight. Plenty of other places to check out instead of this.",

When we were told we had a 45 minute wait, we waited an hour for a text that never came, since they never put us on their list.  Unfortunately, while we received excellent service from our first server, our second server, Richard, was slow to take orders and get our food out. While I loved the fried chicken when I first got it, the second time when my girlfriend got the dish it was lacking its signature honey drizzle and thus, lacked some needed flavor. The restaurant was kind enough to take this off our tab since our food took a while to come out.   The pork nachos were good and the monkey bread was good as well, but nothing special. My ribs were good, not great. Ultimately, I am giving three stars because while I love the atmosphere, the restaurant seems to care more about big groups and outside of its few signature dishes, the rest of the food is only average. Considering the prices on the menu, it seems that people go for the atmosphere rather than the food.",

Tip 2: Free Valet Parking = So awesome.  Don't forget to tip.   Tip 3:  Pretzel Fondu is an absolute must get, no discussion just get it.  Check out Luice T review for more on it.   Just like the phx location this place has a great atmosphere, very casual, open and fun.   I always feel welcome and relaxed here.    There old fashions are pretty good too, as is the rest of their drink options.    Honey Chicken is True to its name, and delicious.  Also a fan of their Turkey Pastrami.

After the errands, we were strolling, looking for noms and decided to stop.  We are SO GLAD WE DID!  There were so many plates we wanted to try, we just started with apps and a meat/cheese board and went from there.    The meat was outstanding.  I have a New Yorker on my hands, who swears he can't find good \"deli\" meat and this met his standards and then some.  The cheese was also delicious and delightful!  I also had to add the deviled eggs because...deviled eggs.  Those did not disappoint either.  We shared the Soft Pretzels with Fondue and Pierogies.  I kinda wished we hadn't gotten the pretzels, simply because those are on a lot of menus around town, but they were good nonetheless.  We make pierogies at home, and these were definitely up to par too.  Both sauces for each plate were amazing.  Do you get it yet that we liked this place?!  Finally, we topped everything off with the monkey bread.  Warm, gooey, sweet monkey bread.  Served with fresh vanilla ice cream (yes, you could see the bean specs in it)!  Hot apples on the bottom, don't GET ME STARTED!  The drinks were delicious too.  I had a mule and my boo had one of their specialty drinks - I'm pretty sure it had 3 types of rum in it, but it literally just tasted like iced tea.  Mmmmhmmmm!    Finally - the service.  Our waiter was so accommodating, made awesome recommendations, and was SO attentive.  We were thoroughly impressed.  We cannot WAIT to go again and try more goodness!!",

Definitely somewhere you'll want to sit and enjoy I went on my lunch break so i ordered at the bar. Will go again.  Updating my review: I'm a very picky eater, and cheese is one of those picky things for me on food. so it's not to blame on CD it could have very well been my funny taste buds. The prices are great. The staff is great. The environment is great and I'm sure there's plentiful other dishes I can try that suits me!",

    "text": "My first impression of Culinary Dropout is how much style and creativity went into the restaurant itself.  Albeit a little hard to find at first (it's tucked away near the train tracks west of Mill Ave), this place has one of the most beautiful, laid-back interiors I've seen in awhile.  In what looks to be a warehouse that was seriously remodeled, they have enough space to fit a stage for live bands, a full alcohol bar, and a plethora of seats and tables.  Speaking of live bands, they have live bands playing on the weekends, even during lunch hours!  The music was at a perfect volume: loud enough to enjoy, but quiet enough to be able to hold a conversation at your table.  Very, very nice touch of entertainment to an already good-vibes kinda place.  My friend and I both ordered the Fried Chicken, which they are supposed to be well-known for.  Even as a Texan of 1.5 years now, I have to say, this fried chicken did NOT disappoint!  You get about three pieces of fried chicken (a drumstick, a breast, and a leg), cole slaw, a buttery biscuit, and some mashed potatoes & gravy.  All 4 were seriously on point and complemented each other perfectly.  The cole slaw in particular was quite the heavenly surprise.  Some of the white meat in my chicken leg was a little bit dry, but it was otherwise extremely and superbly well done.  Unfortunately, I did not try any of the beverages or appetizers on the menu, but it's just one of many more reasons to come back.  Four and a half stars in my book, and will probably see star #5 after my next visit.  If you're anywhere in the Phoenix Area, this place is a must visit.",

We were served house made chips and pretzel bites as appetizers, and both were excellent.  For our entrees we had the option of meatloaf, fried chicken and some type of fish. I had the fried chicken, it was 3 bone in pieces, white and dark meat. It came with a biscuit, mashed potatoes and coleslaw. It was decent. My husband had the meatloaf with green beans and mashed potatoes. The meatloaf was average, he's not into ketchup smeared on top, and then they put the green beans in the ketchup in top of the meatloaf.  For dessert they brought banana cream pie, and a s'mores pot de creme type thing. The s'mores was pretty tasty!  I'd have loved to have had a real meal here, but I'd bookmarked it before our trip and was glad to get to try it!",

You have the option of eating indoors or out.  The patio has good heaters so it's not bad on a cold day either.  Have it 4 stars just because there was a floaty in my water glass. It happens.  I ordered the sweet potatoes pasta, less the Brussels sprouts.  It was good and light, perfect for a lunch item.  My friend got a sandwich with fries.  She said hers was good to, fries were a little greasy.  All in all, it's a good go to for lunch, will definitely be back, maybe dinner next time.

I ordered the hummus plate. When it came I asked the waitress where my pita was and she said, \"oh, you want pita instead of vegetables?\" She started to take the vegetables away. I said, \"I can't have both?\" She said, \"no, you asked for vegetables.\" I said, \"So, I can't have both?\" She said, \"No, you asked for vegetables.\"  Okay, folks so look at my receipt and then look at what I received in my order. I could have ran into Fry's grocery and had better and been faster.  This should be an embarrassment to this establishment. Remember only one slice of carrot was eaten before the picture was taken. The hummus was a 2 at the most and that was because I was hungry and it was food. I never received any pita. Actually, as I eat the hummus........a 2 over rates it. I usually tip well but asked for a box and am headed to get some food now. No tip.",

The staff members are great. They really take care of the customers. I love it when a server keeps drinks topped off and can give us their opinion what to get on the menu.  There is always a lot going on in this area but there seems to be a good amount of parking right at the restaurant so you don't have to park in a parking garage.  I can see myself coming here again in the future but not very often. The price is a pretty big deterrent for what you get.",

The texture is more like rolls, more light and yeasty then pretzels should be. The shape is different as well, bigger, square shaped and less of a crust. They went from the best pretzels to below average. Please go back to the original.",

I also had the Gorgonzola Chicken Salad $13, with butter lettuce, radicchio, arugula, fennel, smoked almond, tart cherry. This salad would have been delicious had it not been for the unbalanced load of arugula in the mix which, again, made bitterness the predominant flavor.

Perhaps he could have guided us to better choices. Overall the atmosphere and energy was great. Just disappointed in the food. It showed little effort to plate or/and prepare.

    "text": "I first saw Culinary Dropout in Austin, TX, but I had missed my opportunity of trying it there. I saw that there were several locations in AZ, but both a Lyft driver and my friend, who is a local, suggested that we go to the Tempe location. Culinary Dropout is such a cool restaurant, and I so wish that there was one in the Bay Area (specifically San Jose, CA, of course)! It is the perfect place for a fun date night or a chill, lowkey hangout with all of your friends. It has indoor seating, a centralized bar, an open lounge area, a games area, and a stage. This location has valet parking.   What I thought was awesome about Culinary Dropout was how it can be the one-stop shop for your all around entertainment needs. You can go there to play games, listen to a live band, or watch sports. There were plenty of TVs all around the restaurant, and I was pleased that the Warriors game was playing right by our table. After dinner, we went to the games area and rented out pucks to play table shuffleboard. Other games I saw were Cornhole and Ping Pong. There may have been more further in the back, but I didn't venture past this area.   Great customer service on all levels. I previously had made reservations for 6:00pm through OpenTable. We were stuck in an hr of traffic to get out of the damn airport, so I must've called the restaurant 3x's to keep pushing our reservation back. Shoutout to the hostesses who did their best accommodating us. They were able to fit us in at 7pm, which ended up being perfect timing. As soon as we walked in, there was a table ready to go for us. I really appreciate when we don't have to wait longer for a table to clear up. The wait staff was awesome. Our waitress, in particular, was upbeat, friendly, and attentive. Since 2 out of the 3 of us were new to Culinary Dropout, she gave us a detailed rundown on what was good on the menu and how to order the meat and cheese board.   The cocktails were enjoyable and certainly creative. I had the Drunken Panda, and my friends ordered a Deviant Behavior and Between You and Me. The Drunken Panda was very refreshing with the cucumber sake and calamansi. As I drank the cocktail, I would top off the glass with Lucky Buddha lager. Between You and Me tasted slightly bitter and tart from the grapefruit. Deviant Behavior tasted like strawberry lemonade. I felt like I could down those back to back no problem lol.  I thought the food was excellent. There were so many items off the menu that I wanted to try, but I was able to narrow it down to the Shaved Prime Rib Dip and Fried Chicken. Luckily my bestie wanted the same things. We figured one of us would order one item, the other person order the second item, and then we share halves. Our waitress did us a favor by recommending us to split these items, which was an awesome alternative since everything was portioned evenly. The Shaved Prime Rib Dip was pretty good. i'm not sure if it was coming off the meat or the au jus, but there was something salty and peppery I liked about it. The side of fries were cooked well too. I loved the fried Chicken platter. It came with sides of mashed potatoes with gravy, coleslaw, and a biscuit with honey drizzled. The coleslaw had creamy dressing that it wasn't overly drenched in, which allowed for a nice crunch. The mashed potatoes were smooth and buttery. The biscuit was fine but a bit dry. Lastly, the fried chicken was delicious. I found that the chicken meat was moist, and I liked the sweetness of the fried batter.",

The restaurant wasn't busy at all however our waiter took a long time getting our orders in and forgot to bring a drink my friend ordered after reminding him three times. When our food finally came out, the server slammed it down on the table for two of my friends. The food was not tasty at all. The steak was too hard and the salad was very underwhelming. The only good thing about the restaurant was the live music which was phenomenal. I definitely do not recommend coming here.",

It was two honey flavored biscuits with brown gravy, fried chicken breast, topped with two over easy eggs. YUM! We also tried a Bloody Mary with bacon infused vodka. Eh, it was a bit 'too smoky' flavored for me, but the bacon IN the drink was lovely. We also tried the mimosas which were far better then the marys.",

We were seated shortly after we arrived at a table in the back of the restaurant. There was a gaming area behind us with bean bag toss and other games. I don't know if it was available for all customers or special parties but the adults back there looked like they were having a blast.   We were in town for a conference. There were 5 of us at our table but several others from the conference were dining here. The conference provided a bus to take us to the area but we weren't able to catch it on the way back because it took so long in the restaurant. The service was very slow. Do not get in a hurry when you dine here. We were here about 2 1/2 hours so we missed the bus but that wasn't a big deal. We just got an Uber to get back to our hotel.   I have a weakness for meatloaf so I ordered Ma the meatloaf which came with green beans and mashed potatoes. It was very delicious. The manager came over and offered everyone free dessert due to the slowness and mistakes with our orders but I was too full so I declined. Others in our party said the desserts were very good.   The food was worth it but their service needs a bit of work.",

They quoted the wait at 45 minutes, but mentioned that my group could go to the bar or high top tables to eat there if there was space. We ended up waiting and the time to get to a table was a little over an hour. We had the fries, which were hot and crispy. We also had the soft pretzels and provolone fondue. The provolone was delicious. I tried the green curry that included cauliflower, eggplant, snap pea, and brown rice. The brown rice was split and had a spongy mouthfeel for those who like that. The green curry had the typical green curry flavor. I also had the soup, which was a minestrone. There was no meat in it, but it was a chicken based broth. I think I would have been more satisfied with the salad. The restaurant was pretty noisy and I couldn't really hear other people talking at my table. The restaurant was initially quite hot when I arrived, but they later closed the doors and turned on the air conditioner.",

When she did bring the checks back, our waitress stated \"Oh Happy Birthday, To whoever's Birthday it is.\"  Only Gave this place 2 stars for the sake of Being Able to PROVIDE my Horrendous experience to shed LIght for My Fellow Yelpers and because the location is PRIME.  In my FAIR estimation Food & Service could've been ten times better if food was not overpriced and service actually cared about customer.",

Also had the onion dip and homemade chips. The dip needed more flavor but the chips were good and salted well.  They do have an interesting menu which is going to bring me back. The service was decent, nothing great although not bad either.  If you go, don't sit out back by the fence. You get NO breeze at all and will sweat your a#! Off. No fun!

Our salads took at least 30 minutes to come out. I would suggest they offer some type of bread or homemade chips knowing we would be waiting for so incredibly long. Also the drink service was super slow we flagged our waitress down a few times for refills. Won't be back.",

We stumbled upon Culinary Dropout, which has multiple locations in Arizona.   To warm up, my mom and I ordered bowls of Yesterday's Soup, which reminded me an Avgolemono Soup. It consisted of lemon scented broth with shredded chicken, wild rice, carrots, onions, and celery.   We shared Sherry Glazed Beet, Garden Kale Salad, and Rainbow Trout. For the beet appetizer, we felt that the flavors were great but a bit too pricey for what we received especially when we skipped the goat cheese. The Garden Kale Salad consisted of a blend of vegetables (including Brussels sprouts, sweet potato, asparagus, cauliflower, and red cabbage) tossed in a lemon tahini vinaigrette, topped with chilled smoked salmon ($), and garnished with pine nuts and parmesan. The Rainbow Trout consisted of a grilled rainbow trout cooked in beurre blanc and served with green bean, toasted almonds, and caramelized shallots. The restaurant was able to split the dishes into two portions at no additional cost. Desserts sounded tempting but we felt it was too late to consume desserts. We plan to return on our next trip to Mesa!",

We had just gotten off the plane and were looking for something tasty and decided to give Culinary Dropout a try. When you get there you instantly fall in love with the atmosphere and design. There's areas for chilling, music, games, groups. You could come here for so many occasions. The staff is attentive and helpful, not only with food/drinks but comfort.   It was difficult to decide because everything on the menu sounds amazing and has a unique twist. I ordered the steak salad and it was sooo good. It was super fresh and tasty. My parents had the Italian grinder which looked amazing and their plates were basically licked clean so I'm pretty sure they'd give it 5 stars. My brothers burger looked amazing too. Fries were great long with the pickle (I can attest for those since I stole them).   I highly suggest this place for date night or going out with friends. But overall just highly suggest. If they ever open one in Dallas I'll be the first customer... if I'm not the owner. Seriously in love.",

The service was friendly, the atmosphere was comfortable and the food was amazing!  I recommend the Antipasta salad.

I am a vegetarian and they dont have anything on the main course menu for us veggies which is why I ordered a nachos without meat as an appetizer. When I ordered hummus as the main course, the waitress felt bad and quickly ran to the kitchen to talk to the chef if he could hook me up something veg and came back with a couple of options. We finally settled on a veggie wrap and I jokingly said that you should add this to the menu so that I remember it the next time. The next day when I was heating my left over wrap, I was surprised to see the recipe on the box. Truly nice place and nice people.

I highly recommend this place(our waiter was not very great and they switched out mid shift which was a little confusing) But overall the experience with the food which was incredible, we got the prezel bites with provolone fondue and it was scrumptious.

My girlfriend and I had the pork belly and shrimp ramen. This was my first ramen dish and it was incredible. The pork belly gave the dish a wonderful smoky flavor and the  cilantro and bean sprouts added a real freshness and nice texture. I would recommend this dish to everyone. For dessert we sampled several dishes. They were all delicious, but the real standout was the caramel custard topped with caramel popcorn. I could get addicted to this stuff. I will never come here and not order this. I don't remember the name but I call it caramel crack!",

This was our first time there and I was amazed at how loud it was inside at 4:30 in the afternoon.  When our waitress finally arrived, I asked for lots of water.  It's damned hot out in the summer!  I explained to her that I would like LOTS of water.   Fast forward to the food... it was average.  We had the pretzel bites for an appetizer. Not horrible, but not spectacular.  He ordered the fried chicken, and I had the fish and chips.  His complaint was the chicken was over cooked and too crispy for him.  I thought it was cooked fine, but really lacked flavor.  The fish though, that was pretty tasty.  It was a lot of food.  Too bad I spent most of my meal with an empty glass that should have had water in it.  LOTS of water. I had to ask the hostess for a refill as well as the food runner.  My waitress was very visible on the floor, but could not seem to be bothered by checking in on such a lowly two-top.  Will we go back? Probably not.  This place did not rank on my list of \"must have again\". And thanks for the migraine due to dehydration... That makes the visit even better!",

    "text": "I am an extremely huge advocate for how amazing culinary dropout is. However, this location needs to take a few pointers from the other two locations. I didn't even get a chance to sit down in this restaurant before being treated like trash by their hostesses. The four airhead hostesses that you had working tonight need to learn their job before being sent out into the world of restaurant hostessing.   I've been a hostess. Your job is just that. To host and to be the first and last impression that your guests  have of your establishment. It's not hard to at least pretend to care about your customers.  Now that I've had my rant, let me tell you about my 2 minute experience that left a sour taste in my mouth about this particular culinary dropout location.   Upon walking into the establishment the hostesses just stared and didn't even greet us with a simple, \"hello\". My boyfriend had to stand there for several moments before they acknowledged him. He told them how many it would be (it was going to be 4) and the hostesses, upon him asking how long the wait would be, responded \"I literally don't even know right now.\" And we just looked at them. Then they go further on to say, \"all of the tables we have for the rest of the night are going to reservations, but you can sit on the patio at an open high top.\" She also told us that one had just freed up and that we could have it. So, without even offering to show us the way, sends us out to look for the open table that supposedly exists. We go out there, no open high top. We walk back to the hostess stand and say to the girl that there are no open tables. She just replies, \"oh, sorry. You can sit at one of the couches on the patio.. But it's not full menu.\"  Oh. Thank you. I didn't come here to eat dinner. (Sarcasm).  When we tell them that we have no where to sit because we want to eat dinner, they again, blankly stare at us and respond with a less than sincere \"sorry.\"  My boyfriend is not patient and tells them we are leaving because they are refusing to even offer to help us find a table. Again, less than sincere, \"sorry\" as we walked out.   I understand that it is New Year's Eve and that you have a lot of people to accommodate, but your hostesses, instead of standing there at the host stand, clumped together, should be out doing everything they can to try and accommodate ALL of the guests who want to dine in your restaurant. (That includes bussing tables, walking the floor to find open tables, or find almost finished tables). I've been a hostess and a waitress and these girls did not know anything about customer service in the food industry. And even if you can't seat me tonight, at least try and act sympathetic and show me that you're doing everything in your power to treat your customers well. Otherwise you're going to continue to lose customers to Postino right down the road.  Again, I love culinary dropout as you can probably tell by my previous reviews of the other two locations, but this one needs some work. The other two locations have customer service down to a science.",

I either love a restaurant or hate it and usually it's for a very Seinfeld-esque reason. The name is wrong. The font on the menu is pedestrian. The website is horrible. *none of which apply to CDO, btw.    I'm kind of mad that CDO took over for the Sail Inn so for sentimental reasons alone; I don't like CDO. However, I was blown away by customer service and attentiveness of the servers that were assigned to my group for our work event. We were well taken care of and the tokens to use for drinks were way better than ticket methods. Having ping pong, corn hole and stage nearby make for the most fun atmosphere.  Food is typical bar food and nothing I MUST HAVE and need to go back for. Restaurant week is coming up and I don't feel like I'm missing anything if I don't visit Culinary Dropout.   For atmosphere, drinks and food; this is a great spot. I could also see myself coming here on a date or suggest it as a \"first date\" spot.",

The atmosphere at Culinary Dropout  is really trendy, relaxing, and cool.    My friends and I were famished, so we opted to order some the pretzels with provolone fondue and it excellent.  I couldnt get enough of the pretzels, and if I hadn't had an entree coming, I probably would have polished off the whole order by myself.  As an entree I ordered the chicken club sandwich which came with a chicken breast, ham and bacon.  It was quite good.  My lunch companion had the fried chciken, and mac & cheese and it equally delicious.  The service was perfect-our server was friendly and there at the right time every time.  We will definitely come back again.",

It's essentially just another sports bar with a clever name and relentless PR suggesting they are the new holy grail of comfort food. No way! For what I paid for a skimpy roast beef (They call it prime rib!) au jus sandwich, I could have had THREE at any diner or even Jersey Mike's subs! It tasted fine, but there is absolutely nothing special or creative about the food here. I'm sure millennials get off on the huge cavernous dining room with the dramatic high ceiling, and the spooky trek through the dark hallway to get to the dining room, but so what?! All the publicity that drew me to this place only to feel cheated reminded me of when I finally made the trek to \"Matt's Big Breakfast,\" another classic Phoenix ripoff sold to the public with hipster puffery.",

    "text": "So my first visit to the Phx location a few years back wasn't so great. But I thought I'd give this location another shot considering Fox restaurants usually have favorable reviews. So I was trying to book a party of 14 on a Saturday evening and called around all over the valley. I was denied several times (Thirsty Lion was incredibly rude on top of it. Uggg.) until I called Culinary Dropout. The hostess on the phone was great to work with and they were very accommodating with my party's size. Thankfully majority of my party arrived on time (we were here on 3/25/17). The food was great! We really enjoyed the soft pretzels and cheese and the pork belly nachos were amazing. Nobody in my party complained about their food and the prices were what we expected. So I'm dropping a star because of our server Megan. She did take our order and got our food delivered to us with no issues. The problem was she wanted nothing to do with us. We tried to make her laugh and we thanked her many times over. But never once did she make us feel welcome. Not one smile and super uptight. Everyone at our table kept saying \"what's her deal?\". It was a real downer to have her as our server other than getting our order right (btw ... I was a food server for many years back in the day and no stranger to customer service). But we did have a blast in the patio area playing cornhole. You just need to drop your ID off at the host stand for the bags. So thank you Culinary Dropout for taking us in, for the yummy food and for making it a fun night to celebrate. Please do me a favor and reevaluate your server staff.",

Also ordered a Phoenix Shandy(?) which was recommended by our waitress.  It was a nice, light, refreshing drink.  We played some corn hole, and ping pong which was fun.  I was a little worried going into the bar since it's near (actually on) the ASU campus that we would be the \"old people\" but it was a great mix of young and old.  The staff was very friendly, and outgoing.  Would strongly recommend that anyone in the Phoenix area make this place a priority.  Wish we had more time to spend there, great way to kill a bunch of hours.",

I ended up ordering the Kale Caesar Fried Shrimp Salad and it was delicious! The server recommended getting the shrimp sauteed instead and it was a great decision. I couldn't stop eating it. Others in my group ate burgers, and they were huge and looked so good. The servings are generous and the drinks are good and generous too!",

    "text": "Absolutely horrendous service. We tried to make reservations for a party of 12 two days in advance and they refused. We tried to call ahead to get on a wait list the night of and they refused. So we ended up waiting for over two hours for a table, several people in our party left to eat elsewhere and meet up with us after they were done and they still came back before we had gotten our food. 90% of the people at our table that did order food received it cold.  I ordered a straight whiskey which it took thirty minutes to receive, even though everyone else in the party that ordered mixed drinks received them in a few minutes. It is also impossible to identify who the servers and cocktail waitresses are as they carry purses and wear regular clothes so it took us twenty minutes to flag down a waitress while waiting in the bar area because she didn't come and take orders from our table and we had no idea who worked there.  Poorly run, and the food isn't worth it.",

I had the tortilla chicken something or other. The fried chicken is pretty fing good. The biscuit? Phenomenal biscuit. And I can make a mean biscuit. Let's see.. Oh I had the corn chowder cannelloni. That was amazing. I didn't get to try any drinks but seeing that there was some hipster guys behind the bar with righteous beards that made me feel less of a man I think they are probably pretty amazing. (The beards too). Anyway if you are in town eat here. You probably will not be disappointed unless you are a terrible human. Sorry for the lack of punctuation.

We were able to play different games and watch football on the TV all while participating in different drink specials.

The service we received was the BEST service we have had in a very long time. The waiters all came and help our table, it didn't feel like \"oh that's your waiters problem.\"  Our son had dropped a fork and two people came and help us before my husband got out of his seat. Now about that food, DELICIOUS!  The menu is simple which I like and everything is quality and great:) the portions are big some enough to share. After the best service, great food, we thought we were in for an expensive ticket. NOPE! Very fair priced and even made it that we would come back again and again! Thank you for such a great experience for our family!",

The menu doesn't have a ton of vegetarian options but the few they have (pasta, salad) or that you can make vegetarian (burgers without the meat) are good.  I especially like the corn and mushroom cannelloni, which is an awesome vegetarian entree. The flavors are complex and satisfying, and the dish is filling on it's own without an appetizer or salad. The salads are decent sized, but I find I usually need something extra to make it a meal (some cheese and crostini from the tapas menu, a side of fries).",

The pretzel rolls w fondue appetizer was AMAZING. loved them so much it was hard to want to save room for my meal. One of those could serve about 6 ppl probably.   Also had the prime rib friend dip which was fantastic. My wife's pub burger was decent.   But the restroom facilities are amazing. Solid core doors on all stalls, wonderfully designed color/tile scheme, and a huge trough sink that's very roomy. Also the only partition between the men's and women's sink portions of the restrooms are the mirror so you can actually see through to the women's restroom. Kind of a cool detail!",

At 5p on a Saturday night we were told we would need to wait 90+minutes for a table.  We chose to sit at the high-top tables which are first come first serve.  Although our server was very friendly, the service was terrible.  It took a long time to order, and then the wait for food (and we only ordered appetizers and something off the kids menu)!  We got out in time for our show, but only because I asked for the check and to-go containers the moment our food arrived.  $30 for appetizers for one adult and one kid is a little steep.  I'll stick to the happy hour menu at the Tucson location.",

    "text": "Ohhhhh my gosh. We said we wanted a food adventure, and we definitely got one at Culinary Dropout.  During our visit to Phoenix, a friend took us to Culinary Dropout, and I was immediately entranced by its hipster vibe. Inspirational quotes at the entrance, open space seating, brick walls, and super chill workers. There's also a huge bar area in the middle, a separate banquet-like room for private events, and a stage. We were also starving -- we had flown in early that morning and didn't have a proper lunch -- so, in our hungered craze, were a bit over-ambitious in ordering.  We also did not expect portions to be effing. huge. HUGE.  We started with the soft pretzels and provolone fondue. The pretzel buns are so deliciously soft and warm, and the fondue is the perfect match for it. I swear, I probably could have eaten the entire order and been perfectly happy. But we stopped ourselves from devouring all of the buns so that we could save room for our entrees. (Fun tip: the pretzel buns are actually still pretty good the next day! Just pop them into the microwave for a few seconds. So don't feel guilty about packing up a box to-go.)  The boyfriend and I split the fried chicken and 36-hour pork ribs. They were nice enough to split the order onto separate plates so we didn't have to deal with cutting everything up and trading plates. But dang. When they brought the plates out, each half order was more than enough to fill what we thought would have been a normal-sized order. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and the ribs were tender and fall-off-the-bone good. Needless to say, we were so stuffed and couldn't finish everything. We managed to happily roll ourselves out and fall into a deep food coma. Soooo gooood.",

Not sure if he didn't hear the order or if different drinks come from different bars. Rah member of the party got their drink at a different time. Ordered 2 apps. The first one came out but the second never did. We thought it was going to be a pattern like our drinks, but soon after the first app dinners started to arrive. We received 3 of the 4 and waited a few minutes for the fourth. In the mean time, the salad that was ordered was missing the chicken. 10 minutes later a small, cut up chicken breast was delivered. Server seemed to begin ignoring our table. Food wasn't bad, but didn't live up to the hype as seen on local news shows. Very average. We ordered fish n chips, a few sandwiches and the Kale Salad with chicken. Great bar atmosphere with corn-hole and fire pits. We may return to hang out, but won't return to eat. Cooks shouldn't have dropped out of culinary school. To top it off, valet service moved their station during dinner and we wandered the parking lot looking for the workers. A True comedy or errors.",

Although the chicken breasts wasn't too dry, the thigh is always the juiciest so I only ate that part. My boyfriend's rib was amazing, it was wayyy good and the fries too. I didn't try his soup but he said it was really good. Overall,  I really like this place. I'd love to visit again and try more of their dishes. The atmosphere is comfy and outside they have heaters to keep you warm. The place is very beautiful, I think their food overall is amazing. My other 2 friends order looked like they really enjoyed it since it was all gone. It was the steak something and salman salad.

The restaurant was very clean and the long both seats were comfortable.  My shaved brisket dip sandwich was excellent, and the fries were amazing. I didn't have any alcoholic beverages so I cannot speak to their quality.   The hummus appetizer was pretty good, the pita has a very nice light spongy texture but the hummus itself needed a bit more salt.  My wife wasn't as impressed as I was, she didn't like the corn in the salad she had, and thought her pasta was mostly raw and had a weird texture to it.  I'd recommend this place based on the really good food ans service I had and if you're into live music, they have it on Wednesday's, Fridays and Saturdays.",

Food was great. They need to train their bartender on drinks. Ordered a Sex on the Beach and got Vodka with Soda Water. Another bartender tasted it and replaced it with a way better version. Would definitely return!",

The concept of this restaurant is awesome and has the best service (probably the main reason I gave it 4 stars). The location is a prime location if you want to eat here and walk around old town later. Basically, go here if you want to be served by cool people but not really get the bang for your buck. It's definitely a cute date restaurant - great Moscow Mules!",

My time spent at the Temp location did not live up to this. First, we asked the host to be sat near a heater outside, and he took us to the farthest coldest table that was very dark. We then decided to sit in the open seating next to the bar. We sat down and waited 20 minutes without anyone coming to serve us. I went to the bar to ask for a server and it took another 15 minutes to get water. By this time we had been there for 45 minutes. We finally ordered drinks which were not the drinks we ordered. Had asked for draft beers and got bottled. We ordered food, both of my friends food was good but my tomato soup was cold. It was also my friends birthday and they brought out his cake when he wasn't there and it was very uncomfortable and awkward. I feel so bad that we got such bad service on his birthday, I am so sad this location did not live up to my expectations because the staff was so inattentive, I really felt like I was bothering the restaurant staff by being there.",

The rave is the pretzel bites based on everyone's reviews but I think they are sleeping on the Thai chicken wings and house chips with onion dip. They were AMAZING and we had no left overs :) The fries with a side of ranch will never steer you wrong! I can't speak to the drinks because we got the paper bag specials...which was hilarious and questionable all at the same time.",

Just make sure you mix it a bit so it completely liquifies.  For lunch, I ordered the pub burger with bbq sauce bacon and fontina. It was a great burger! Exactly what I was looking for post marathon! I'm not sure I breathed while eating. I also chose the salad as my side, and I was actually impressed! Not being a fan of ranch, it was light enough to not be overwhelming.  Many in my party chose the shaved prime rib w au jus. They raved and I mean raved. If this is down your alley -- go for it!!!

I said \"Maybe a little later,\" and was planning to order some in about 5 minutes but she never came back... We didn't see any waitresses or waiters anywhere near us till a totally different waitress dropped off our food. She was a lot nicer than the first one but she ran off pretty quick before I could even order the alcohol I was planning on getting in the first place. No body refilled drinks, nobody even asked how we were doing, we were completely ignored. We had to literally flag her down to get the receipt. It wasn't even busy, there were maybe 7 or 8 tables with people. Its REALLY frustrating when your waitress ignores you. Also, minor side note, but the dress is really bad? This restaurant is pretty obviously not for kids because waitresses had more in common with a Hooters than an actual high class restaurant.",

    "text": "I met with Sam Fox many years ago in Tucson.  I built a website for his restaurant WildFlower Grill when I used to work for the Arizona Daily Star.  Now his empire has vastly grown and includes Culinary Dropout.  With my first time being here, we met up with some friends here for lunch. My wife and I usually split entrees when we go out.  When we are on vacation, we don't really like to take \"home\" leftovers (i.e. back to the hotel).  We split the Shaved Prime Rib Dip sammich and it was honestly one of the best I have ever had.  The bread was soft, instead of hard and crunchy like most other places I've tried.  My friend had the Green Chile Stew.  The server really talked it up so he was expecting it to be amazing, but it was just good (which isn't bad).  My one gripe with these new, trendy restaurants is the choice is seating.  The metal chairs are painful to sit on...no padding whatsoever.  This is a big deal and factors in my decision to ever come back.  They do have couch-style seating which is much better.  Some of the couches surround fire-pits which is really nice to have when it's chilly.  A note on parking:  we parked in the \"front\" of what we thought was the restaurant.  It turns out the restaurant is in the far back of the building.  Park on the side where there is another entrance to CD.    Also, this place goes by another name:  The Yard at Farmer's District.  I believe it's the outdoorsy area where you can play shuffle board, cornhole and other games.  There's also a bar behind the play area.  It even has it's own Yelp page, which curiously enough - also points to Culinary Dropout.  Overall, we had a good experience.  The beers were cold, service was prompt and the food delicious.  Just remember to bring  a seat pad with you if you decide to visit ;-)",

I enjoy the food though so it did make me come back after having a few different bad experiences with the service. The food is always tasty with a lot of flavors and interesting menu.  The bartenders are so slow, heard the couple next to us saying that they were chatting with each other over taking orders for the last 3-5 minutes. Ordered a Whiskey/Coke and it took over 10 minutes to get it to me. The bartender was rather passive aggressive taking everyone's order. I never let one time dictate my overall opinion of an establishment but this has been over the course of 5 times going here. The food is not worth having to deal with this service so I would choose other places where the customers are appreciated more.",

    "text": "With a few hours before our flight and hungry bellies, the boyfriend and I set off to find a unique place nearby to have dinner. I had overheard a conversation about Culinary Dropout with some fellow Yelpers and since it's a popular \"chain\" locally I knew we had to try.   So glad we did!  The design was fabulous - a mix of industrial and farmhouse chic to give the space a super hip feeling. Complete with an array of game zones that included ping pong and cornhole.   We opted for the charcuterie board as a starter. It was made fun by the unique way to order, very similar to sushi! Although I admit, I became a little overexcited and started jotting down way too many options. The BF reeled me back in and eliminated a few. Good thing too!  Between our cocktails (amazingBloody Mary btw) and Wings (damn that plate of wings is huge!) we were almost ready to Call it quits! But quitters we are not.   For entrees we ordered the fried chicken and meatloaf - as suggested by our fab waitress. She did not lead us astray as both plates were fantastically delicious. Meatloaf was incredibly similar to my mother's. Coated in thick ketchuppy-tomato sauce its a perfect example of \"traditional\" meatloaf! PS - if you put BBQ sauce on your meatloaf you're absolutely despicable (love you!)  Fried chicken was up there on my faves. No where near Thomas Keller status but above and beyond your typical.   If CD were to expand I to Bakersfield I just know they'd find success. Their blend of unique, creative and fun makes them a powerhouse restaurant.   With that said - please come to Bakersfield!",

The good news is they have ping pong tables, foosball, a photo booth, TVs, a bar, and live music - all to entertain you while you wait. The band that was playing was amazing, it's too bad I didn't catch their name.   As for the food - if you're feelin' like have something fishy, I'd go with the salmon over the trout.",

I've tried several sandwiches/burgers and they've been ok - nothing spectacular but nothing bad either.  Service is hit or miss.  Sometimes you'll get a really great server who's really attentive, other times if they're busy you'll be waiting a bit. On our visit last week, our waitress was wearing a dress so short it was borderline inappropriate.  I would never allow anyone on my staff to wear it to work.  The atmosphere here is 5 stars - great decor, great outdoor seating area with games to entertain yourself with.  I send people to this restaurant frequently and always tell them to get the pretzel fondue - it really is a stellar item and is consistently awesome every time.  Parking here is a problem but they usually have valet.",

Foodie without being prententious, and seems to have a little sense of humour. Live music was good and not at an overpowering volume. I am here in Tempe on business and came in strictly off Yelp reviews, and can't see how I won't come back again while I am in town. Service was on point.  Lots of nice choices on the beer menu.

We had 4 parents outside on duty at a time watching our group and \"the monopoly man\" AKA Jorge, kept telling us we needed to have a parent at each area. We were sitting at a table with our appetizers and cocktails right where our kids were playing cornhole and we had a group of 4-12 year olds not 20 feet away that we were playing ping pong. There was no where to sit and have a cocktail or appetizer near the ping pong tables or foozball table. If the sign said something about parent supervision I wouldn't be writing this but the fact that we were supervising and being criticized, chastised in a very condescending way by someone who is not a mother was very discouraging. Every other employee in the place was friendly, polite, happy to be there and provided excellent service. Just say no to Jorge (\"the Monopoly man\"). Do not pass go, do not collect $200. I will never book a large group there again.",

The hostess would not even make eye contact with me when I was trying to setup a seat. We waited and finally got in but they forgot the high chair. We got the high chair and put in our drink order which took 20 minutes to get back. Then we ordered food and that came in another 20 minutes and so we ordered another drink and it took another 30 minutes. We did not leave the place until close to 4 pm. Our waitress was not concerned about our wait but it was very disappointing to wait forever. The food was okay but the fries were totally burnt. Not sure if I will be back to this location again.",

Another friend ordered a salad and had to ask THREE (3) for some balsamic vinegar (the first time was WHILE ordering; the second time was when the food arrived; the third time was 15 minutes after the food arrived), which came 10-15 minutes later.

I like Sam Fox concept restaurants, but for the fun live music and pretty interior you end up paying a little more than you probably should. The server was very kind, and the band did an amazing job of sounding like Jimi Hendrix. The burger was thick and tasty, and the beer samples are appreciated. The liquor, like the food, is slightly higher in price than you'd pay at similar restaurants.   The Culinary Dropout is a neat place, and I'm sure I'll return at some point, but competitive prices are not of their concern.",

The staff was super friendly, better than what I've experienced in Tempe or Scottsdale. I will always recommend heading to downtown Gilbert to hit these restaurants, even though we live closer to Tempe. Staff was super friendly, food came out quickly, easy parking and easy to get a table. My daughter and I ordered the vanilla apple bread pudding French toast, it was delicious. My mother ordered the salmon from the brunch menu, and loved it. Other members of my party ordered breakfast sandwiches and we're very happy with what they had. Again, we were a part of a party of about 15 people and never once did the staff seem stressed or troubled. They kept our drinks filled, and took great care of us. What a great way to show friends and family from out of town our local hotspots!!",

I was really impressed by this attention to detail. I was also equally impressed by Ryan P., the bartender. He was also extremely helpful, professional, and had great energy.

Because of my sons special needs he eats slower than most people but every time we come it's like the server brings the check before we can finish our meal. Tonight was an extreme case. The girl who took over our original server was rude and pushy. She never asked us if we needed anything just brought the check before my family was even done. There are no other people waiting to sit here so why push out the guest you have who determine your tip. I appreciate the restaurant but would love a little more time to relax",

The steak came out and I thought it was chicken because it was so done. I tasted it, but the waiter never came back, there were also brussel sprouts on the plate. At the end of the meal, I passed the steak off to my friend and he told the waiter why I did not eat it. The manager refused to take it off the tab and never even visited our table.The waiter told me it was because he checked on me and I said it was fine. I and everyone around me disagreed with him  and told him that I did not touch my food and waited for him to come back. He acted surprised and thought he had. I told him it was fine, but I would not be back and I was disappointed because I had heard so many positive reviews.  I did not tip him well since my understanding was the reason the manager would not remove the food from my bill was because he had said I told him it was fine. I told him I would be posting this on yelp. If you go to Tempe, pick a place who values their customers.",

    "text": "A $550 dining experience that turned into thousands of dollars.   We had reservations for a party of 13 on May 11th to celebrate my daughter's graduation. We were seated at a table very close to the door nearest the valet parking. Our waiter was great and the service (drink and food arrival) was a tad on the slow side so there were a few times that different members of our party went outside to take pictures, grab presents from their vehicles and smoke. During this time, the doors were wide open with other customers going in and out while security was also standing at the door.  I myself went outside numerous times during our two and a half hours at the restaurant and each time was given a \"once over\" by security. I thought nothing of it at first and chalked it up to people watching on security's part.  We all finished our meals and some of our party ordered deserts and some ordered celebratory shots. Soon after, our waiter informed us we were cut off. When asked why or by who, he stated he had no idea why because it didn't come from him or the bartender but came from security. Alrighty. Squared up our bills and went to leave. Everyone started heading towards the parking lot while being followed by two security guards. We had two designated drivers whose vehicles were already full so my son called an Uber and while waiting for their ride, everyone waited with them by his car while he grabbed a few personal items. When the Uber showed up, they got in and everyone else walked to their vehicles (including back to the valet area). While pulling out, the Uber vehicle was flipped off by one of the security guards who were now both standing at the doors facing the larger parking lot. No one thought much of that at the time other than a \"WTF\". Until the next morning.  My son's car was vandalized beyond belief. A smashed drivers side window, dents and footprints from them kicking the car, keyed everywhere and even damn puncture holes in the body. A mint condition 1993 Nissan 300 ZX. Which, by the way, is a very rare historic vehicle.  It was brought to the GM's attention and she came out and took pictures of the vehicle. When asked about security cameras, she stated that they were only on the door by valet. She went and looked at the cameras and stated that her managers personally walked security out to their vehicles at 1:45 am and that it was on camera. Managers walk security out to their cars?? Shouldn't it be the other way around? We asked to see the tape as we should have been on it as well being followed by security and she offered to send it but never did.  She offered to speak with her night staff that came in later in the day and call back. As you can imagine, no one knew or saw anything. When she asked if there was anything she could do, short of paying to have the vehicle fixed, what exactly was she offering? So, we asked for a refund of the amount spent at the restaurant to offset the thousands in repairs and she seemed surprised we even suggested it. She said it was the first she was hearing about any bad service. That's not the point. We didn't complain about the restaurant itself but the destruction of our property and since SHE ASKED what she could do, we took her up on it. No dice. She then pointed out that \"this happens all the time\" as if we aren't the only unfortunate customers.  We then got a call from Erica, the Regional Operations Manager who not only offered the refund knowing how expensive the repairs would be but also was way more interested than Alyssa, the GM looking into what happened. She also informed us that security has zero say when a customer is cut off. It's strictly up to managers and bartenders. Neither of which came to our table, and even served my daughter another drink immediately after being cut off. She also seemed very surprised to hear that this is a common occurrence and it was not to her knowledge.  Hopefully security gets their shit together and this is looked into and it never happens to anyone else. Cameras definitely need to be placed outside the doors facing the larger lot.",

I was ready to brace myself for some salads as usual when I have to go for luch with others who eat normal foods. But then I was so content with the taste, how they mixed and paired the ingredients. It is not an asian dish nor american style but definitely a creative dish full of flavor as well as the the level of cooking vegetable was just right that can preserve the natural sweetness and crunchiness of the vegetables. My other parties also seemed to like their steak salads.",

    "text": "I dig Culinary Dropout. From the decor, to the food offerings, to the casual, trendy vibe. To the music selections, to the ping pong tables outside and the misters that help during hot Phoenix summers.  What separates Culinary Dropout for me from the other places in Tempe is the way the restaurant carries itself in attitude. No one is trying to upsell you stuff that you don't want, and it's just a chill place to be. No obscene drunks, and no stupid bar fights you might see nearby on Mill Ave.  Word of warning to prospective customers; this place is LOUD. When coming here, make sure you're okay with this, they sometimes have live music here which makes it even louder and can make conversation difficult especially if you're on a date.   Some favorite menu items of mine: \"Ma, the Meatloaf!\" - Classic meatloaf with mashed potatoes and green beans. The green beans are not the crappy kind from the can. Meatloaf is packed full of flavor yet makes you feel just the right amount of full.  \"Korean Style Ribeye Cap\" - This dish has hints of Asian Korean flavoring; it is a consort of ribeye steak and assorted veggies. Really good, would get it again.  \"Bistro Steak\" - See how I've only been ordering red meats here? The bistro steak paired with the fries is really good, whatever they use to flavor the steak is out of this world, some combination of a strong herb and a cream base.  As far as drinks go, I haven't had a bad drink here, but word to the wise, when I get moscow mules here, it's not served in a copper mug. Still, not a bad drink.  Would and have returned.  No need to talk about service; it is good.",

Service was good had to flag her down a couple of times to get refills. But she was extended over a few tables. The crowd was loud and young. I have no problem with that.  But don't go look for this to be a quite place. We have a nice time.  If I ever go back I will call first to see what they have available.",

There's an area out back that is covered but feels like it's outside and games behind it (corn hole, ping pong, shuffleboard). Lots of TVs for game day - Cocktails: unique offerings. For bubbly they had more than mimosas. I had one that had fig vodka and elderflowers and another with gun and strawberry. - French dip: my hub really liked it. 4 stars - Breakfast sandwich: as big as a burger with egg, bacon, and avocado on a bun. 4 stars - Breakfast potatoes: little uneven squares of potato goodness cooked just right so they are tender inside and crispy outside. Bonus for the large sprinkles of salt to top it all off. 5 stars  - Grilled cheese sliders: cute pair of squares of the sandwich.  - Milk for kids: huge pint sized one in a plastic cup with a lid. Usually my lil guy guzzles down the tiny cup they give him and needs a refill.  Midlights: - Breakfast burrito: not bad but bit boring with an omelette like egg and couldn't taste the chile apparently in it. 3 stars  - No coloring menu for kids: don't expect this everywhere but would be fitting here since I saw a bunch of kids there.  Lowlights: - Didn't have room to try the desserts which sounded yummy.  Enjoyed our brunch here and would come back for another meal.",

    "text": "3 1/2 stars, and I'm just not excited enough about what I ate for my main course to move this up to 4 stars.  Fun, open atmosphere, friendly and helpful service, decent food.  After walking in through a seemingly endless hallway (with an admittedly nice view into the kitchen), I arrived in the main area of Culinary Dropout. I immediately liked the setting, from the openness of all of it to the modern tables. I don't think the smaller tables with the pub-style seating looked very comfortable, so I'm glad I didn't sit there. I was with a large group, and despite that, the service was always quick and attentive.  We had a few appetizers to start. The BBQ pork belly nachos were delicious--guacamole, black beans, some tender and saucy chicken, and a few other toppings were all on there. The soft pretzels and provolone fondue were pretty tasty as well.  I ordered the shrimp and pork belly ramen. I had reservations about ordering the ramen, but I had been craving ramen for a while, and this was the opportunity I had to have some. The waiter convinced me it was delicious, so I went with it. When it came out, I was sure that he had been right. Everything in the bowl looked great! The pork belly looked awesome, the cilantro, mushrooms, and sprouts were nice and fresh, the shrimp looked tasty, and the soft-boiled egg was delightfully tempting. I was hoping for a slightly larger bowl, but it looked great.  Once I started eating, though, I just wasn't impressed. Don't get me wrong, the ramen wasn't bad. It just wasn't all that great. The pork belly was cooked nicely, and the soft-boiled egg was perfect--nice and runny inside. But it was all rather bland. There wasn't much flavor to any of it. It was pretty \"meh\" to me.  Now the reason I added half a star and was tempted to add a full star came at the end of the meal. The bourbon black bottom pie. It's ridiculous. The chocolate ganache is fantastic, and the graham cracker crust adds a lovely texture. But what really did it was the salted caramel sauce that is on the side. Oh, man, this is good pie!  If it was all about the pie, this could be 5 stars. But my disappointment with the blandness of the ramen required a lower rating. Maybe a subsequent visit will convince me to bring up the rating.",

The total for both the drinks was $20 after the tip. My card was charged $25 for whatever reason. Called to have it fixed to no avail. $5 is definitely not a big deal at all, but my only concern returning here going forward is getting overcharged again.

My biggest gripe was that they brought my entree with my soup so I asked to have it come out later after I ate my soup. The girl who was the runner tonight couldn't even find me when she brought out my soup. I needed people around me to call her back to give me my soup. Oh and they never brought me my entree.

Two different managers even approached us during our meal to introduce themselves and make sure we were happy with everything. I learned a lesson in all of this, to speak up if I'm not happy with the quality of a meal right away, instead of going home and writing a negative review. I should have said something the first time around, instead of worrying about being labeled a complainer. Negative reviews should only be written if you bring issues up, and no attempt us made to resolve the isssue/ problem.",

    "text": "I've been a few times to this location, 3 to be exact. All were okay except this last one. I went on a Friday night (it is beyond busy on weekend nights by the way) and I sat outside with a group of about 8 at one of the fire pits. When we were to order, the waitress took each of our cards to start a tab. I've never been anywhere before where they do this, but it's not something I'm comfortable with to say the least. After about 2 hours of hanging out and conversing, we all paid our tabs and left. I woke this morning to get breakfast with my mom and noticed I didn't have my card. I immediately called the location and they took my information down and told me they would call when they had a manager in. An hour and a half passed and I still had no call, so I went in. Once I reached the hostess stand, they grabbed me a manager immediately. Why wasn't I called when she arrived like they said? I explained the predicament and she checked all 3 places they would put it, found nothing, then called the waitress. The waitress claimed she gave it to another one of the girls in my party. When I called all of my friends, none of them had it. The manager also brought up the fact that I hadn't asked for my card back that night. I'm sorry, but what other restaurant do you go to where you have to ask for your debit card back from the waitress? I had clearly forgotten she had it since it had been nearly 2 hours after she had taken it. Opening tabs is not something I'm used to, I hadn't noticed. Her remark angered me, obviously. So now I've gone through the process of cancelling my card, requesting a new one, and a painful truth pulling experience all for the price of a mediocre pretzel fondu.",

We had a group of 12 (with a reservation) and were seated fairly swiftly upon arrival.  But from then on it was all downhill.  Must have had at least 7 different waitstaff working our table and each meal that arrived needed to be sorted out.  Wasn't as much of a challenge as you might expect because the meals came at 3 different intervals.  As for drinks that was worse.  The first round only took 15-20 minuts, a second round ordered by a few took the same and one of our party never did receive his.  The food was creative and tasty, will grant them that.  While they may be \"Culinary droput's\" they seem to be able to know how to make a $ as the place was packed.",

After an hour and a half I decided to go ask the hostesses what was going on and they told me \"there's only a couple more tables ahead of you\". After another half hour of waiting I went up and asked again and they gave me the same answer. What bothered me is that they didn't even seem to care or sympathize that I had been waiting for nearly 2 hours or try to reassure me that I would be called soon (even though we had already watched several tables get seated before us). I'm very disappointed in the service we had experienced and will not be returning, at least to this location.",

We told the server that we would appreciate light on the simple syrup because we don't care for sweet cocktails.  We want to taste the whiskey.  They were still too sweet.  Asked again and brought us manhattans instead old fashioned's.  Tried to tell us that they were the correct drink. He was maybe young 20's and barely knew what each drink was made with.  Trust me we were given the wrong drinks.  The trout was disgusting and excessively salty.  Told the server and figured he would get a manger or take it off the bill.  Guess what, neither happened.  He asked if we wanted a box for it and we repeated its gross and salty.  Brought us the bill and we said fuck it.  We had plans and tickets so we left.  Disappointing experience.

We were all also waiting for our entree.  We all order the fried chicken dish. The chicken was very juicy especially the breast. The flavor wise was good, not the best fried chicken I ever had. The Biscuit was honey glazed and was a good side to have. I wasn't a big fan of the coleslaw and mash potatoes were average.   Super fun place to chill with friends.

It was just really a cool place and really a great atmosphere just to hang out with friends and let loose.   Our group got the soft pretzels with provolone fondue, Korean Brussel sprouts, and crusty bread. All were good. The crusty bread also went well with the provolone fondue that came with the soft pretzels. Maybe they can add that as an option for the crusty bread.   My main entree was their Korean style ribeye cap, it was ok, I would not order it again. It seems like a stir fry, I was not sure what it was going for.   Overall, great place to hang out, not too loud, we were able to have a conversation without any trouble despite that there where seems about 200 plus people that night.   If you are in the area, definitely check this place out. Make sure to make a reservation.  Our server Nicole was also awesome. She is one cool chick!",

The open area was spacious-- plenty of room between tables and a huge game area with Cornhole, shuffleboard, and ping pong.  The menu offers options for everyone without being overwhelming. The vegetarians at our table were so satisfied with the corn ravioli and pierogi dishes. I ordered the turkey pastrami sandwich with fries. The sandwich is served on a pretzel roll, and it did not disappoint! The turkey was savory and balanced well with the sauces and cheese. The fries are perfectly cooked!   After enjoying our meals, we played ping pong and shuffleboard. You can check out game supplies with the host.   They also have BEAUTIFUL banquet rooms-- I would totally have a wedding reception or party here.  I'd love to come back next time I visit AZ!",

The turkey pastrami on that buttered roll is amazing!! Lots of turkey piled between a delicious pretzel roll. The antipasti from the happy hour menu build your own or go with the chefs special for a nice surprise.. cheese, almonds, cheese sticks, peppers.. the pork belly nachos are huge and big enough to share .. the meatloaf sandwich is more like a sloppy joe consistency, great flavor, good meat to bread ratio   Sangria, Mules.. cocktails are delicious and refreshing .. Staff is super friendly and energetic, ask for recommendations if you're unsure, they are great at steering you in the right direction",

I found AZ to be one the hottest places I've ever visited and my weekend trip ended at the spacious and breezy oasis of Culinary Dropout. Having spent 1 or 2 or 3 nights too many indulging in bachelor party activities, CD was the perfect spot to wash away the sluggish Sunday and prep for the flight home.  I downed a few (?) of the highly recommended Bloody Marys from our wonderful waitress, trying 1 bacon flavored 'mary, and x-amount of traditional 'marys. The seasoning was spot on and spicy, and it contained the scientifically precise amount of WuusterShiiire sauce (PHL accent), providing the highly desired consistency of a perfect 'mary.  My vegetable visit continued with one quick kale salad before departure, topped with a wonderful combination of sweet potatoes, asparagus, pine nuts, and optional chicken. Great way to convince yourself you ate healthy all weekend!  The back area was also a great place to hang out and cool off with table tennis and cornhole under the mist machines, though I opted to sit out ALL games due to the aforementioned soreness-inducing \"exercising\" from the preceding days.   Awesome place! If I ever find myself in AZ again, I'd be sure to stop by.",

The place itself is really hip and has all sorts of eating areas (couches, high tops, tables). I had the hardest time picking what drink to pick since they all sound so good, but I opted for a refreshing Pomegranate Mule and I was not disappointed. As for food, I knew I had to try the pretzels and fondue after I had seen multiple orders brought out. It's literally boujee pretzels and cheese, you can't go wrong!! I chose the garden kale salad with salmon for my main meal, and it was just what I was looking for after I had stuffed my face with pretzel bites.

I felt that the bartender was friendly and engaging and was able to recommend me some great beers. The food was great too, and I was very happy overall.

The \"Double Blind,\" a random beer and a random airplane mini chosen at random, we didn't get that, but fun concept! My friend got the Sangria, which was an amazing happy hour drink. Check it out if you're a tequila fan! The rest of us got beers or cider. The food was all delicious! We ordered: -Handcut Fries -Pork Belly Nachos -Pretzel & Fondue -Today's Chopped Salad -Korean Shrimp & Chicken on a stick  Everything was amazing and so much more than your typical happy hour food! This was way more than enough to feed four adults and two kiddos who snacked after their kids meals!

    "text": "I typically enjoy my outings, although normally that's w/ a large group & copious amounts of alcohol.   Unfortunately recently I went in a small intimate group of three; we ordered drink(s) at the bar while we waited for our table; when we were sat we had more drink(s),  an appetizer, and three meals.  So my check was a fair amount of money and I feel like I always tip well.   Now I feel like my orders are all fairly basic and straight forward:  Drink: Titos, splash of soda and squeezed limes.   Appetizer: Pretzels  Dinner: Butternut squash ravioli and added chicken.  Now I'm reasonable,  I know you squeeze a ton of fresh limes for your various drinks & margaritas.  BUT bartender if my Vodka drink looks greenish & pulpy...you might want to taste it before sending to a customer because it was so tart that anyone would have recognized that it was undrinkable. Even after requesting less lime, my 2nd drink wasn't any less tart than the first...unfortunately.  My 3rd drink was slightly better but not much.   Now dinner again simple order, it's a staple on your menu. We are sitting at our table nibbling,  chatting when all of a sudden 2 very nice food runners walked up and said, \"chicken breast\"? And presented an individual piece of grilled chicken on a plate.  We all looked at one another,  thought about it and we responded,  \"No\" and continued on w/ our nibbling & chatting.   When our dinner arrived 10 minutes later   (which is fine we were enjoying each other's company). I realized that my pasta didn't have the chicken mixed in and/or sliced and placed on top.  I mentioned it immediately while also realizing that the chicken you delivered to me 10 minutes earlier must have been meant for my pasta...but does that make sense?  First in my opinion to bring the chicken out first separate from the dish itself is odd. Regardless, if that is your standard practice,  why so far in advance  of the rest of our meals?    I didn't complain,  just requested for the chicken. At this point,  I am starving and begin to eat what I at least have in front of me. Now this is my go to dish if I'm not feeling anything else on the menu because I typically will enjoy it. Unfortunately this time the ravioli was not fully cooked (firm/chewy),  the center was just warm, and missing chicken. I will say my chicken was delivered fairly quickly! But I believe it's because they brought me the same piece they originally delivered 15 minutes earlier. Normally I wouldn't think or say that... the only reason I do is because unfortunately for me I didn't taste it just dumped it into my bowl and mixed it around. My first bite of chicken was cold, as was all of the chicken which then quickly cooled my entire meal.   It's unfortunate because I live fairly close and like having places that I can walk to.  But if I spend well over $100 for a full dining experience w/ my family, I  expect good food, drinks and service.  I'm giving you a total of 2 stars. 1 star because my company enjoyed their fish & chips and beverages. 1 star for, I believe our poor waitress's name was Amanda,  because there wasn't much she could do with the cards she was dealt. She was sweet, and fairly attentive.  Tip: Amanda for future, if a customer requests for their 2nd drink to have less lime due to it being too tart and the drink you deliver still looks greenish vs. Vodka-ish its probably to tart. But when you ask and your customer confirms that it is.  Don't get soda water to dilute it...go get a new one and make sure the next one is right.   Although disappointing because we went to make up for a belated bday dinner for my sons 21st. This still won't be the last time I go but I hope the next time is a better experience than this most recent time.  I am sorry for leaving a rough review and I hope the next time I can update my review to speak about nothing more than how much I enjoyed my experience. Hopefully this review will do nothing more than help.",

My first impression was the place is quiet happening with all youngsters, yard  was full with ping pong and other games. The music was loud and we and the waitress had to literally shout at each other for orders.   We settled for some drinks, the cocktails tasted good but seemed a little over priced. I have removed all the stars because of the food. The food was ok, not that great and was very overpriced. we ordered thai chicken wings for appetizers and it was decent. I ordered salmon in entree which costed $22 and tasted below average. Their dessert chocolate  with marshmellow topping was good.   I was happy with the place and atmosphere but not the food. Its a good place only if u planning for drinks, i would have been ready to pay more for the food if had tasted good.",

She was kind, honest, and it was nice to see that she really values genuine customer feedback and cares about continuously training her employees.   Came back with a different group of friends, none of which have been here before. We all had a good time! It was right after a work day on an early Tuesday evening. I had the grilled chicken club with bacon and a side of fries and it was delicious! The group also had the BBQ pork nachos and cheese fondue with pretzels as appetizers and those were to die for. The service this time was superb. Even though it was pretty busy for a Tuesday night, he checked in with us frequently.  This was a completely different experience compared to the first one, and I'm so happy I gave CD another chance. I know every place has room for improvement, and I think they are in good hands with Haley proactively seeking ways to do so.",

    "text": "Is it me or have most \"hip\" restaurants gotten louder and are the dinner tables getting smaller (just like parking spots)? If all of this is True then I need to start looking for restaurants that cater to robust (healthier) people like my wife and I.   Now back to the food review - in town for a conference and not feeling hotel/resort food so I looked up the best restaurants in Tempe/Phoenix. Several showed up but not really craving anything in particular we/I decided to pick the one that offered the most variety of food, this ending up at Culinary Dropouts. Yes, you're reading that correctly. I wasn't sure how to take the name but the location was interesting and the conversion of the old building was quite creative. The time wait was over an hour but we had committed to this place and so we decided to wait around. After running out of things to look at and an over stare through the kitchen window our number came up. The beer selection was a bit weak, mainly hipster hops and blends but the one I ordered was decent.  We wanted to make an honest assessment of the food so we pretty much ordered everything on the menu. Pretzels with cheese fondue, cheese Perogies, fried chicken, the pub burger and the 36 hr pork ribs. The pretzels were spot on but the fondue was a bit weak, it was too light on the cheesiness, maybe a Sharp Cheddar would have worked better. The Perogies were a bit hard and the flava was flat. The fried chicken was juicy but the flavors were a bit bland. The 36 hr pork ribs came to the table as cold as the weather. I wouldn't have eaten these even if they were cooked for 365 days. The flavor of the sauce was good but I couldn't believe they would serve Cold ribs, unless that's the way they eat them in Phoenix. The star of the evening was the Pub burger, it was juicy and had lots of flavor and personality. All in all this place was okay. Would I go back? Probably not I would just Dropout. My advice: lower the music, this isn't a club it's a food joint. Don't serve cold ribs!",

Both cocktails were good.  I prefer the Manhattan served on the rocks.  I had the Korean rib cab, and it was amazing.  It has a bit of a spicy kick to it, but nothing overwhelming.  My colleague ordered the fried chicken and it looked amazing.  Be aware the fried chicken comes with three portions of chicken: leg thigh and breast.  It was a lot of food, but the kind that was amazingly delicious.",

The Brussels sprouts were delicious, the pretzel buns and cheese dip was so good we took some back to the hotel! The waitress was very down to earth and helpful. Sorry I forgot your name!  but she was great and attentive. I ordered a blueberry beer and I highly recommend trying it! Overall my lunch, brunch or whatever was amazing.

I didn't finish the biscuit. It looked very appeasing, but the taste didn't meet the standard. I also ordered the pink margarita, but was advised that they'd run out of the pink flavor; only to see other patrons get the same drink, with the flavor they allegedly ran out of .  I was excited about going, because I heard/read raving reviews about yesterday's soup, but they only had tomato bisque.. I'll pass. The ambiance was amazing, hence my higher rating.  They have areas for private dining, which I thought was really nice as well. Would I go again.? No, but it was a nice experience while on vacation.",

Both were delicious, with a good ratio between topping/dip and carb (we actually had leftover cheese!). I ordered the ribs, which came with fries and coleslaw. The meat came off the bone easily, but the ribs could've been a little meatier. Didn't really bother me though, because I still had half the rack leftover for lunch the next day! The coleslaw was eh, but the fries were nice and crispy. My s/o got the steak, which he liked, except he found the horseradish slightly overpowering.   Service: Phenomenal. Our waiter checked in on us a lot (without being intrusive) and had great attention to detail.   Decor: I get that it's supposed to be trendy and all, but I didn't really like the interior design. Its modern and chic, but impersonal. I've driven by the downtown location, and based on outside appearances, that location would be better if you're looking for some ambience and warmth.   Parking: There were a lot of parking spots, which is awesome, but this place is clearly hella busy, and so it took us a couple circles to find a spot. I saw when I was walking in that they have a complimentary valet service, which would probably be worth preparing for, if you are meeting people there. (Finding parking made me late to meet my friends by about 10 minutes)   All in all a great experience. Would do again, but probably at a different location.",

But seriously, I came here while on the Whole30 diet and went through the menu tediously before hand to see that I could eat something at this restaurant before coming. I ordered the steak and potatoes and NO WHERE on the menu does it mention cheese. No where. Additionally, when I asked the guy at the bar to please provide me with new potatoes because I am dairy free, he brought me back HALF of the potatoes that were on my plate in the first place. Really, HALF?! Maybe I'll come back when I don't have eating restrictions, but if you have any, don't come here.",

    "text": "Possibly my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix/Tempe area.  Yelpers, Culinary Dropout is the food adventure you've been waiting for.  The portions here are massive, and so is the venue. I think they may have converted an old warehouse at one point into this culinary haven. They have a MASSIVE indoor space with dozens of tables, and a huge bar. But it gets better...that space is DOUBLED with their outdoor space that has a roof, fans with misters, and so much more seats everywhere!   But enough about this gorgeous space, let's talk about the food. This is delicious, flavorful new American cuisine with a southern flair and massive portions.   If you're here with at least three other friends, I would recommend at least the pretzel buns with fondue. It's delicious but they're massive buns and fill you up pretty quickly. (You've been warned!)  I split the 36-hour rib and an order of the fried chicken with my girlfriend. Our waitress was kind enough to make each a half order and put them on multiple plates for us. Definitely didn't expect that, but it's always nice when it happens!  Let's talk about the ribs. They were amazing. Juicy, succulent -- they just fell from the bones. Packed with flavor from the seasoning and rub they use. I still dream about the ribs sometimes.  The fried chicken was pretty delicious as well, but it definitely didn't compare to the ribs.  If you're here with just one other person, I would suggest an appetizer (like the pretzel buns) and then just share the ribs. Maybe get a couple of drinks too, but that's all you need.  Seriously, I need to come back and try their entire menu.  It definitely also looks like they have space/rooms that could be used as rentals for big groups. Would definitely recommend this location to anyone.",

Only difference is that there is a slightly more limited beer selection, but the full menu is still available. The place is huge and has really unique seating options, including banquet tables and large square seating arrangements around a fire pit. The game area is great and the visibility into the kitchen is really cool too. I ordered the grilled salmon with veggies. I'm trying to be mindful of what I eat so I ordered something on the healthier side. It didn't matter though- everything was delicious and didn't compromise on flavor, regardless of the fact that there are obviously more decadent items on the menu (36 your ribs????). A must try for Phoenix.",

However, went last night to this location and was feeling like a steak. Ordered it and got maybe 2oz of steak covered in a Tom of French fries. The steak tasted good but for $25 bucks the portion was ridiculous and basically just $25 for French fries. I've had other things at the other location where the portions were normal but really disappointed this time. My date ordered the rainbow trout and it ended up having several small bones left in it, I understand sometimes smaller parts of the bone in the skin, but overall not a great experience for us this time. Extremely disappointed!  UPDATE: After getting contacted by the management (Alyssa the GM and Haley the AGM) my date and I went back and had the best customer service and the food was on point! Very pleased with the customer service and food was incredible. Must have caught the chef on an off moment or something the first time but very very glad I went back. Special kudos to the management for being so welcoming and excellent communication.",

The Gorgonzola salad was delicious but skimped majorly on Gorgonzola and I think smoked almonds are gross.  The Marcona almonds were standard. The monkey bread was good just not as buttery as in the Midwest.",

So, we grabbed 2 stools at a dirty high top near the bar. Mind you, more than half the restaurant was empty. I had read rave reviews about their pretzel bites. When I looked around, I saw empty tables that had baskets full of pretzel bites including the high top we occupied. I took that as bad sign #2. When the server finally showed up to greet us, he offered to clean our table in 'just a minute' that turned out to be 10. As soon as he brought the menus, we ordered the Brussel sprouts. They came to the table before he did, again. After tasting them, we decided to cut our losses and leave. Anyone can deep fry a Brussel sprout and douse Crystal hot sauce on them. Come on! Not only are they culinary dropouts, they must hire Management/service dropouts, as well.",

    "text": "Okay Culinary Dropout round 2.  We hit the one at The Yard a couple weeks ago and last week for lunch I brought my kids here.  Yep, I'm one of the few people who think it's important to train our next generation in appreciating food, atmosphere and service.  And how to behave in restaurants.  And to let you know my kids are both double digits. So it was lunch, on a Wednesday.  Things were pretty slow, as I was hoping I really don't want to be hanging out in a bar with my kids.  BUT the food was so good the last time I had to come back.   Service was not as amazing as it was at the yard, I feel that Jeff was a gem in the culinary world.  It was good, Ashlinn didn't warm up to us until half way through our meal. She was surprised by my children food selection and their conduct.  Our meal!  Yes the most important part of the review...  My son ordered the chicken club sandwich.  He devoured every bit and said it was even better than our favorite place back in Wilmington, Nc.  My daughter has now deemed their muscles the best EVER.  I concur now that I've had them twice, in 2 locations... and the bread. YUM! They finally sold me a loaf as it was mid week (YAY! and it turned into THE best french toast I've EVER made, topped with strawberries and my amazing 'little bit of heaven' vanilla sauce. I had the Shrimp Caesar again... there is something either the breading on the shrimp or the dressing it like crack... YUM.  Culinary Dropout has quickly become my favorite place to grab some grub.  It's amazing food and atmosphere, I love how every thing is so casual.  If I were 20 years younger I do anything to work here.  I now need to check out the Scottsdale location.  Thank you Culinary Dropout!!!!",

The homemade ranch was tasty and went well with the fries. My friend got the muscles and liked them and my wife wasn't all that happy with her salad.

Beer selection was pretty good as well, and wait staff was very helpful in finding us beers that we would enjoy. Portion sizes were good.  Our server definitely seemed like he was trying a little too hard to be friendly. Service was slow--our waiter took a long time to materialize after we sat down, and the food took forever to come out. Yet our waiter would linger for excessive periods of time and make weird, desperate jokes when he did decide to grace our table with his presence. I am probably being overly critical, but I found it a little odd.  I know that the cheese dip and pretzel bites are absolutely to die for--I had them at the Scottsdale location once, but resisted chasing the dragon on this visit. I recommend getting that if you want an appetizer.  Atmosphere is pretty good. The decor is lovely--I love the tables and chairs especially. But even as an design student in my early 20's I thought the whole vibe of the place was a bit too hipster-y for my tastes. Good place for mustache and beard spotting, though.",

Hostess refused to let us sit inside which was unusual because they don't usually take Patio reservations. There were several open tables inside when we arrived, while we were there and when we left. It was 108 that day and incredibly hot on the patio. I don't understand why we couldn't sit indoors when there was availability. Shame on you guys, you've lost my business. Dinner was miserably hot and unpleasant.",

Our appetizer was average at best and the entree was no better.  As for the seating, we had a fire pit and played cornhole while we waited for our food. It was a lot of fun!  Too bad the food was a disappointment...",

She was cheerful and professional and patiently answered all of our questions.  I ordered the crispy shrimp Caesar salad.  Delicious.  Now we have a new restaurant to add to our repertoire.

Happy hour doesn't include the specialty drinks, just house liquors, so I usually end up with sangria. It's got a great cool atmosphere, I've had good service, and the apps are awesome. My favorite is the chips and onion dip, that onion dip tastes so fresh! The actual full meals here aren't worth the price. Salad, fish and chips, and meatloaf are some of the full meals I've had and I've never been impressed.",

So I decided to come back again today and bring a friend for a lunch date and had another great time. Our waiters have always been so personal, friendly, and attentive. :) definitely must try the \"deviant behavior\" drink it's so good and lasts a while because you refill as you drink with the side of shock top. appetizers: the pretzel fondue is enough to share for like 3-4 people they give you so much pretzel bread but it's literally so warm and the perfect starter. Prosciutto deviled eggs are delicious too. (I do wish you could taste a lil more of the prosciutto though). I've also tried the pierogis which were phenomenal! The seared ahi tuna salad was excellent, my friend and I split it and it was enough to fill us up with all the appetizers prior. Previous visits I've tried the black muscles, Korean style rib-eye, and 36 hour pork ribs. All excellent choices! This visit we tried the banana cream pie and it was honestly one of the best I've ever had! Always a great place to go to :)",

Couldn't ask for more. They were warm, but not too chatty. Kept my drink full, asked about what I was looking for and made good suggestions.  I started with a appetizer set that included capicola, cheese and something call \"cheddar pork cracklings\" which are basically like those puffy pork rinds you can get in a bag. All the apps were fine, but not amazing. For main dish, I went with the fried chicken entree. The chicken, biscuit and gravy were all excellent. I subbed my mashed potatoes for french fries with gravy (I'm from Canada, what can I say). Also excellent.  The only thing that fell a bit short was that the half breast portion of the fried chicken was dry-ish. The chicken included thigh, leg and half chicken breast. The other pieces were very good, and breast meat can sometimes be a bit dry so I wasn't  too worried. The staff was gracious and quickly offered to redo the chicken, but I relented as it was needing room for desert. For desert, I had the apple monkey bread, which was a phenomenal apple bread pudding a la mode. Great stuff.  Over all, the place is a great vibe with live music, even in the weekend afternoon. The food is very good, and the staff is absolutely awesome. I'll return to try their sandwiches which I've heard are great.",

The chicken soup was a meal in itself with lots of chicken and veggies. The hummus was the very best I have ever had. I should have asked what the seasonings were. So good. The French dip was also very good with a different au jus dip. My chicken sandwich had a different avocado paste that was great.  The bread was vegan and had drizzle on it that was terrific.",

There is a live band playing (some really good mix of songs through out the ages ranging from country to RnB to rock.  Their beer list is pretty decent with the exception of they don't carry a few simple ones that people might go to (ex: budweiser, corona, dos equis).  Though the selection of beer and drinks they had was delicious.  I had a wild blueberry beer and a drink called Drunken Panda.  They were both very fruity yet had a beer tang to them.   Next we got food.  The 'appetizer' plate was mix of cheese meat slices bread and veggies that we picked and was a good mix of sweet and savory with a balsamic sauce.  Then I had the fried chicken with mashed potato and coleslaw and a honey biscuit.  The flavors were pretty good and the chicken was crispy (just how I like it).  My husband had the meatloaf ( which I chose both meals)  and it was also pretty good with a side of mashed potatoes.  I would definitely come back to this place again to try some more off the menu and some drinks for a good time.    The service was decent but they were busy being a Friday night and all.  We had made a reservation with no problems and was seated right away.  They have the kitchen open late (til midnight) which I think is a bonus and they stay open til 1am on Friday nights.     Can't wait to try this place again.",

Fun atmosphere. Tasty looking options on the menu.  I had the Deviant Behavior along with the Tuna Salad and my son went with an Apple Shandy and the Trout.  Both entrees were delicious and beverages refreshing. We shared the custard for dessert and maybe cuz I noshed on Carmel corn at the DBG just before coming could contribute to my lack of enthusiasm for this dessert. Like this place but don't feel like I fit in on a Saturday night.",

It just doesn't have much of an inviting ambiance like the one in Scottsdale does. But we kind of got over that once we were seated.    So my boyfriend and I started with the house-made potato chips and french onion dip. These were SO good and I'd definitely recommend ordering them while you wait for your meal.  We ordered the Thai chicken wings... So, we're both from the South and we're kind of wing/bbq snobs so maybe we're being picky. But these just were not good. They were pretty slimy and a little bloody as if they weren't cleaned well enough or cooked long enough. However, our waiter was VERY nice and accommodating when we asked if we could order something else instead. We got the fish & chips which came out pronto. They weren't bad, maybe a 3/5.  Overall our waiters and the staff we encountered were very nice and helpful. This place was not horrible by any means, but I don't think we'll be returning.",

Since we were sitting on the patio where it was cool at night, the warmth of the chilli hit the spot.

My pretzels were burnt twice (who burns pretzels is this even possible?) I also ordered the famous fried chicken one was too burnt..one was under cooked... one was just right. Besides my awesome waiter and my perfect drink my experience has cause doubts of the longevity of the chain in the typical five yr life span in the Valley. What was once great not so much and I hope this was a one time only incident with a under experienced cook. I will try one more time before I cut them off completely...but foodies beware quality is at risk.    To be fair my previous experiences have been 4 stars and they have a great patio area (backyard atmosphere) where you can play adult games with your friends and frenemies!",

I like \"the yard's\" vibe a lot. The restaurant itself is open, clean, and \"hip\" for lack of a better term. The outdoor area was awesome. I didn't quite expect the ping pong tables nor the games of cornhole going on and it seemed to definitely liven up the mood. Maybe it's because I'm in my late twenties, but it seemed like a good mixture of customers ranging from college students to older folks who wanted to eat some brunch. I came here with my girlfriend as well as her dad today, and needless to say we enjoyed ourselves a lot. I find the menu to be just enough to make most guests fairly happy. If I had one qualm here it would be that the music was too loud. I initially thought it was because I was in the outdoor area, but it was the same as I walked through the inside to leave once finishing. We were almost yelling at each other across the table and we had to lean in to chat, but it wasn't a deal breaker.  Onto the F and B... I really enjoy the cocktails there. I'm typically a beer guy, but I definitely always resort to at least one glassed drink whenever I'm here. The matador is a must have, and the old fashioned is what I expect an old fashioned to be. No frills. For food we started with the black mussels (you can definitely taste the beer) and the shrimp caesar salad. For our entrees we got the 36 hour pork ribs, fish and chips, as well as the fried chicken. The ribs were what you think 36 hours of prep would be like. They fell cleanly off the bone and had just the right amount of sweetness. The fish in the fish and chips had a light crispy batter and the tartar sauce was great. My only complaint came from the fried chicken dish. It wasn't the fried chicken (the chicken is bomb and worth the wait as stated in the menu). The sides didn't live up to the chicken's standards. The biscuits had a great crust but ultimately were too dry. I know some people would argue that biscuits always dry your mouth out, but I found myself chugging water just to get onto the next bite. Onto the mashed potatoes. I never had their potatoes here, but simply put it was too salty. It may have just been today so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. However, just like the loud music definitely not a deal breaker. I won't go into service too deeply, but let's just say my water cup level never fell below half (they were very attentive), and the prices aren't too bad.  Overall I would recommend Culinary Dropout to most people, and I do.",

    "text": "Great concept, great ambience, good food, very poor service. We made an online reservation for a small birthday dinner for two for 7:15, but were surprised to learn they had no tables upon arrival. We ended up waiting until 7:42. What's the point of a restaurant accepting reservations but then forcing you to wait along with all the walk-ins in an un-air conditioned lobby with the doors wide open? And for a party of two, no less. Upon being seated by the hostess, a gentleman came over to introduce himself and explain that he wasn't our waiter, but another one would be along shortly. Ok. Strange. New waiter takes our appetizer and drink order, then disappears for 20 minutes. Half our appetizers come out fairly quickly (by a different server), but our drinks are no where to be found. Finally get second appetizer, but again not from our original waiter. Wonder again where our drinks are. Finally flag down our waiter and he says he'll check on the drinks. It's now 8:15. 33 mins after being seated, and an hour after our initial reservation and we still haven't been served drinks. Ridiculous. Waiter returns and apologizes for not putting in our drink order. Awesome. We're now done with our appetizers and finally get drinks, except my beer is wrong size, and wife's cocktail doesn't have a straw which makes it nearly impossible to drink. But whatever. Don't wanna nitpick. We let it go figuring it'd take another 20 minutes to fix. Later we ordered entrees and another round of drinks at same time and they were much faster. Food was good. Second round of drinks were strong, so that's a plus. Band playing was a touch too loud, and made it difficult to converse, although they did take breaks. All in all I wasn't terribly impressed with the experience. Their server/waiter system seemed far too chaotic to be efficient during peak hours. They seemed understaffed for a Saturday night. We'd go again, but next time I'd sit at bar to ensure we get drink service.",

Why can't they make it 8pm like other establishments around town?  I will continue to come here, but not with people under 21 if we're going to stay past 6pm. It's not fair to them.",

    "text": "Went last night. I can't say enough about the experience. Our waiter was beyond exceptional and the food reminded me of some of my favorite Portland spots. I'm always looking for that quality.   The pierogies were so similar to a taste of home, my great grandmother taught me to make them and these guys were so similar I could have cried. But of course they took a more developed approach and I can't say it was disappointing. The Brussels chips were crispy and the touch of bitterness married so well with the touch of sour from the creme fraiche and the sweetness of the potatoes. Clearly working out that umami touching on all notes in one dish. I would recommend it to anyone with and open mind to developed flavors and a love of the old world dish.  Matthew had the shaved prime rib sandwich as suggested with onions and mushrooms by our waiter which came with fries.  I don't think I've ever seen him eat so quickly. The cheese was melted to perfection and the meat was rich and each bite was like butter. Along with the fries Matthew requested a side of ranch which was thick and rich with herb flavors. I could speak volumes on this condiment alone.  But what struck us more were the employees. Particularly our waiter, I feel so upset that I did not memorize his name, he is a gem in a world of dying customer service. (Longer brown hair, in a low bun, approximately 6'1\" if not a bit taller, and last night(3/8/17)wearing dark jeans and a red plaid flannel) the food was impeccable but his service is what will bring us back. We had our one year old son with us, who is getting over a cold and was being a moderate terror. Our waiter was so patient with Laige and understanding of his disheveled looking parents. He was there when we needed him without being a bother and he engaged in conversation with me that let me relax and feel not so awful for not having my child under complete control.  We have been living in the Phoenix/Tempe area since September and this was the first dining experience that left us feeling humbled and more than content. And we sincerely cannot say thank you enough for the service and food we received.  Of course Laige's favorite part as well as what set me back as a mother was walking out and stopping at the window to the kitchen to show Laige all the people working steady and hard on the line that provided us the food just to wave and show appreciation and I kid you not. Everyone in that kitchen took a moment and looked up and either smiled or waived at my son. This place is doing it right, putting community back into food. We loved every bit of this experience. Thank you all so much, front and back of the house alike!",

A runner brought our order so we couldn't even order food cuz our server hadn't touched our table. Finally got our food order in and it seriously took another 28 mins to get to the table...  I was done with my beer and since my server wasn't around I had to go up to the bar to buy a separate beer. Oh And i didn't get a side because the server told me not to get the side salad cuz it \"was fucking disgusting\" so I got the tacos by themselves and omg were they bad, dry cold meat I just couldn't eat them. Our server apologized for all the wait and told us that some of the things would be compt and send us out a dessert on the house. Which I was like oh okay, I was already planning on ordering a dessert for my friend's bday. Supposedly the mg was gonna come out and talk to us, which never happened and to make it worst I got charged for everything including the \"free\" dessert they send us! I was looking for my server to say something and I couldn't find him. Being as frustrated  as i was I just paid and left. First & last time I experience culinary dropout!

    "text": "This restaurant is overpriced for the quality and quantity of food you receive. The service and hospitality was very good and our server was friendly and professional so I have no qualms there but I was severely unimpressed with the quality of food from a Fox Concept restaurant.   First the appetizer I purchased was their potato and cheddar pierogis. $10.00 app and you get three small pierogis in a butter sauce with some fried brussel sprouts and cauliflower in a butter sauce. First the pierogis were not all the way cooked through (iced potato's). The veggies weren't bad, but for the price I thought I was paying for Fox quality and got something an 18 yr old working a chili's whipped up after 10:00 PM.   Other people at my table you had been here before claimed that the pretzels with beer cheese was the best thing on the menu? Are you kidding me when your a Fox Concept and the most memorable bite was some pretzels and beer cheese? You know there were issues.   Finally, my entree was Costco green chili's sold in a glass jar at any local Costco with some braised pork and a rubberized egg on it. I paid 16 something for it and all I could taste was salt and cilantro. There was no balance in the dish whatsoever.   I must plead to the owners of this Fox Concept that I do not want my money back, but I would like to see quality in my next visit. But until then I would eat at your own risk.",

We shared the fried chicken and it wS delicious and juicy.  The only bad thing about coming here is the parking. You either have limited parking or have to pay for valet.

Everything about this place says \"FUN party!\" It was a nice precursor for her and helped her (I think) to choose a slightly more academically minded community! Most likely NOT Arizona State. Thank you Culinary Dropout! In addition...this place is awesome! We loved the food! Of course we started with the famous pretzel pieces with the cheese dip...and it's as good as everyone says. Of course it's filling so we settled on salads as entree's and she had the shrimp Ceasar salad and I had the Italian chopped salad...both incredible. The place itself is amazing...with a huge outdoor \"party room\" filled with sofas and games and a really unusual vibe that would guarantee a fun group night. I love this place....and I hope I come back here. IF my daughters team has a road trip!",

The live band was so loud everyone just sat there for the entire time and stared at each other.  Occasionally trying to read each other's lips.   Food was delayed.    But as always, it was awesome.  Meatloaf was especially good.   As was the fried chicken.   But the band was a miss.   They pretty much cleared everyone out.  It was hard rock that was as loud as any concert I've been to.   My ears are still ringing the next day.   We will return but only if they nix the band.",

I love the concept of this place-big, open space, high ceiling, warehouse with cool lighting and hipster servers left and right providing excellent service.   If the ambience wasn't cool enough, just sit down and order something on the menu. My coworker got the meatloaf and he was swimming in it. I ordered the Steak and Potatoes and was drowning in it. Definitely going back with my hubby to try all of their yummy cocktails and other dishes for sure. Probably this weekend! lol  This place would be a great place to rent for company events or even weddings and parties! If the chef was a culinary dropout, thank goodness he dropped out to create The Culinary Dropout.",

Menu offered a plethora of new American cuisine. I indulged in the Black Mussels steamed in Stella Artois. This paired well with an IPA. Service could have been a little quicker, but besides that.. No complaints from me. Being close to ASU, I would have expected more raucous students. It was a very balanced crowd though. Young professionals, married couples with children, and students all mingled and enjoyed the good food. I highly recommend Culinary Dropout to anyone looking for a laid back night out on the town!",

The drink prices are reasonable and the mixed cocktails are delicious. You can't taste the alcohol in the Deviant Behavior and it seriously tastes like a strawberry lemonade. The Gin & Tonic is also decently good here but I guess you can't really messed up on that.   Really wished I was able to try the food here. Heard the fish & chips are to die for. I might have to come back to Arizona to just try the food here...maybe just maybe.",

    "text": "So....ordered some food to pick up today for lunch. Ordered the Pub Burger, a Gorgonzola Chicken Salad and the Caramel Corn to split with a co-worker. Food was great. My issue is with....value. Here are my thoughts when looking at our lunch items individually.   Pub Burger: It is a simple, well constructed burger with a great flavor profile. Thick cut bacon, havarti cheese and barbeque sauce. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium. It was on a pretzel roll which really complimented it well.  At $12 including fries...a solid A for me.   Gorgonzola Chicken Salad:  Chicken, Gorgonzola, butter lettuce, radicchio, arugula, fennel, smoked almond, and tart cherries. So here's the deal....the salad was delicious. But....if Gorgonzola is the first word in the name of the salad, I expect to see more than three dime sized pieces of Gorgonzola in it. Didn't see any smoked almonds either. And at $13 for a salad...I think that I should.  Value? No more than a C.  Maybe ordering a salad to go isn't such a great idea.  House Popped Caramel Corn: I LOVE caramel corn! But, at $4 for two cups I expect more. More corn. Taking the time to cover the corn with caramel more evenly. And how about making some effort to remove the unpopped kernels before you put the caramel on? We had 6 or more unpopped kernels in our two cup order. That is just lazy. Value? D-  So I will definitely try this place again....but I will order a burger and lower my expectations.",

They also had a duo of live performers when we were there, singing some pretty old pop love songs. I came by on a Wednesday and found it not too packed, although this place is huge and even has a number of reservable dining rooms.   For food, we ordered the nachos and I got the bistro steak (wanted the 36-hour pork chops but sadly they were out of it by 9pm). The bistro steak was tender and juicy, and the sauce it came with was a fabulous complement. Nachos were fully loaded and definitely a great app for sharing. Service here was nice albeit at times, a bit slow. All in all, a fun place to grab food and hang out.",

Between us we ordered a Mac burger, kale salad, grill cheese and a cheeseburger. I got the Mac Burger, which was interesting.   I thought it would have some sort of baked Mac n cheese on it, since the menu was vague. It was called the Mac Burger cuz it was similar to a Big Mac: three layers of bun, thousand island dressing, you know the rest.   Although it was a large, colorful and tasty burger, it was nearly impossible to eat. Picture your classic Big Mac, but about five inches in diameter, with lots of sloppy secret sauce. It kinda went everywhere. I switched to fork and knife but still couldn't get it right.   My family was happy with their meals, so it could've been worse. I'll try CD again but with a different menu choice.",

Entrees are about the price of what you would spend at Applebee's, but better quality. Good portion sizes. We did not have a platter of cheeses, but I would love to try that next time! I went with my family and there was not a leftover in sight. We did get the pierogis as an appetizer (we are Polish) and they were delicious. I had the salmon with rice and cauliflower. It was amazing. Randomly, we did smell smoke as if it was coming from inside the restaurant (we were near the door, but it was far enough away that it didn't seem like it was from outside), but that was not he restaurant's fault and we told our waitress who said she'd keep a lookout and we didn't have a problem after that. The lights turned off a little early, but it wasn't a big deal. Some of the waiters/hostess' clothing was tattered with holes (jeans ripped) or they were wearing crop tops showing their skin in the mid section, and many of the men in the kitchen had longer hair not all covered by a net (one had a hat on) and one female did not have her long hair in a net either, so that kind of made me nervous, but I think the style of many who work there is pretty hipster-y, so that may be the vibe they're going for, and as long as it doesn't get in the food, that's fine and is all I worry about as well as safety. Lots of interesting mustaches around was what my mom noticed and she took some pictures secretly. Hilarious.",

I think it might be the same sangria they serve at all Fox Restaurants, so I pretty much always get it! Not to mention the fact that the staff here is always so friendly and awesome in every way!  If you've never been, the pretzels and cheese fondue dip are a definite must order! Looking for an appetizer on the lighter side? The hummus + pita is really great too! As I'm writing this review, I can't help but to reminisce on all the times I've been in to Culinary recently. Whether it be drinks after work with a friend, a corporate work party, or simply a casual Monday night - Culinary is great on all occasions, which is what I love most about it. Dress it up or dress it down, there's no right or wrong here. This aspect shines through in what you order as well. A few of my other favorites: their Thai Chile chicken wings (which is not something I would usually go for) as well as their sweet corn ravioli! Order some appetizers or split a couple dishes among friends! My biggest advice is to explore the menu and branch out! Enjoy!",

My husband and I ended up here when we were unable to go to a different restaurant on Mill. We aren't usually ones to try new places, but I am SO glad that we did. I had an amazing time in a fantastic place with some of the best food I have ever had. This is just feet from my work, which I am not sure if that is good or bad- I might become a regular there. Thank you guys for an amazing experience and great food. Only suggestion I have is regarding the cheese they use, it is a little bland. Otherwise I can't wait to go back!",

Either our server had to many tables or just couldn't keep up with the amount she had. While she was super nice and did her best it was like she was a bit overwhelmed.  The other downside was one of the sandwiches we order was supposed to not have Dijon on it and it came with it,   There is a good side:  while I may really like mustard my daughter does not, we told her and she immediately she took care of it and she took the sandwich off of the bill and made it right.   The cocktails are fantastic the old fashioned was nice just a bit too much water from the shaker, however it still was tasty I would order another.  I dug the environment it was super low key and a great place to hang out!",

I had a Turkey Pastrami Sandwhich and my wife and the pork belly nachos. Everything is made from scratch. The tortilla chips on the were crunchy and hell and even survived the queso and meat bath that was bestowed upon it! Will definately be back before we head back to Dallas. Oh and the San Tan Moon Juice IPA is a local beer that is smooth and not as happy as most IPAs.",

We just came here for post-dinner drinks and fun so I can't say anything about the food. Drinks were a little pricey (i.e. a Stella is $7). But they have a a cool $2 brown bag special where you get a random beer in a brown bag. I had wine, but Ryan got one and I think he ended up getting an Amstel Light.  There are 4 ping pong tables and 4 cornhole game setups spread out nicely in the venue. We played both games until closing.  Will definitely be back!",

Smiling.if it is his credit card he won't be smiling. I will never return this place. Why is it so hard to find good restaurant in Arizona. And still they are opening w high rating. Did we loose the feelings of being a customer?why does it seem like bartender is the owner of the restaurant not customer? We asked why you asked credit card he said it depends on person to person. Does that mean he doesn't trust us? We will run away with bill. Sorry but if that is how you feel, why should I drive 15 miles together there. I make over 100000 a year I don't need to treat me like that no more this restaurant . Please train your people how to treat your customer. Any busy restaurant or bars if staff is well trained, know you request a credit card and every time customer orders you update the bill and place both credit card and bill in the glass in front of the customer. You said you have a high volume of customers, how do you keep track of which credit card to use if you just place bunch of credit cards on the cash register? This is the first place actually required to keep the credit card on the cash register. So as a customer, how do I know I am being charged right if you are dealing w so many customers w so many bills.",

The Fried chicken dinner in the menu warns you that you have to be patient for the chicken. The waitress said it would take 14 minutes but it arrived sooner. It arrived and looked good but the batter was waaay too thick and heavy. It was glazed with honey and the meat was tender and juicy. The chicken was hot. I had to get some siratcha to add flavor and the skin was way too crunchy. I recommend less flour. The mashed potatoes and gravy were excellent. I don't like cole slaw and didn't attempt to like it. My ginger and Jameson was amazing as always! My friend got the nachos and he couldn't finish it because it was so much! There were a lot of FLIES in the place and the air conditioning wasn't effective enough. I overall had a great experience though. The chicken at lo Lo's is better though",

We ordered three appetizers: Thai chili wings, hummus, and house potato chips. The wings were amazing! Saucy and a little crispy above a bed of cabbage. The hummus was tasty as well except there wasn't enough pita for the amount of hummus given and the $9 price tag is a little steep. The house potato chips were good as well, I loved the onion dip. I ordered a drink - the jalapeno lemonade something in which I was pleasantly surprised! It was refreshing with a little kick of spice.  As for the service, no complaints. Our server was attentive without being overbearing.   I'd love to check this place out when the live music is happening! Definitely will be back. :)",

    "text": "After driving for 6.5 hours from El Paso, we had agreed that dinner had to be somewhere that we had not tried before. So, after a quick search, we settled for The Culinary Dropout off of South Farmer. The decision to dine there ranked right up there with taking the correct fork in the road, choosing to stop at the stop sign and then spotting the police officer who was parked and was monitoring the intersection, and turning in the lost wallet and then being met by the wallet's owner with a firm handshake and a sizable cash reward.  The service: amazing. Young, fashionable, and totally courteous were the hostesses. They found us a nice table and threw in an extra chair without any eyeball rolls or drama. The food: da bomb. The Korean Ribeye was a no-wonder-it-might-not-be-available kind of entree. Soft, flavorful, and blended well with the accompanying vegetables. Strawberry and Kale salad: loved it. Fresh, bright, and tasty. The Monkey Bread for dessert: freshly crafted, served warm and ready, and blow-away dee-lish-us. The waiter: truly a classy gentleman. Sayuj  (pronounced Sah-yooj) was a no pressure advisor that guided us through our choices. His recommendations were spot-on and we enjoyed our food immensely.  I could go on and choose not to. Regardless, we loved the place, we were treated well, and I am 100% confident that you will enjoy the place as much as we did.",

I always love their array of cheese and snacks to start off with, it is hard to choose between the Pretzels and the Meats and Cheeses!  I had the Italian Chopped salad and had the rest for lunch today.  Though, they really made the lettuce more of an afterthought and was less salad than I wanted.  My boyfriend had the Shrimp and Pork Belly Ramen, and said the pork belly was nothing to write home about, but good.    The space itself is very beautiful, but we were sat in a half booth that backed up to the cornhole games, and personally, I would not want to sit there again.  Randomly having some guy yell in my ear is not what I want.  I felt that was different from the Yard in Phoenix because the dining and the games are a little further apart.  All in all though, I look forward to my next visit!",

She was wonderful. Took care of our every need. Made suggestions to us that were spot on. The pretzel bites and cheese fondue was wonderful and practically a meal by itself. Heard the fried chicken was great and the reviews were not wrong. Entree of friend chicken came with mashed potatoes and gravy, Cole slaw and a biscuit. So much food! I will have leftovers for tomorrow. It was wonderful and reasonably priced for the quantity. They had live music which just added to the enjoyment of the evening. Will certainly come back.

The roasted salmon is tough to pass up. Other things on the menu are Shrimp and pork belly ramen, Meatloaf, fried chicken, a bistro steak with gorgonzola that is *really* good, sweet potato cannelloni and more.   Do yourself a favor and save room for the \"Bourbon Black Bottom Pie\" for dessert. You'll thank me, I promise.   They have a full bar and a bunch of specialty drinks, too. For local brews, they serve up hops from Four Peaks, San Tan, Huss Brewing and more.   The place is cool, for sure. Good for small and large groups. Private meeting space available, as well.  Valet parking is available.  A great addition to Downtown Tempe.",

I've been several times and enjoyed the Korean style ribeye, and the butternut squash ravioli-I think they call it something else...cannoloni? The desserts are really, really sweet and if you don't enjoy sugar and caramel, maybe skip dessert. I am usually a big fan of dessert after a meal, but the options here always seem to be overly sweet and not very complex. This is a place I usually leave happy and not full of regret that I paid for a meal I could've cooked better myself at home-which happens too often in Tempe restaurants.",

I am not a jealous guy haha but you need to read your guests to know if they are comfortable with that. We ordered and I asked that my French fries be substituted by a salad, he said sure but I still got French fries and no salad. My ribs were dried and not really what I thought. I have heard about this place a lot and then came to try and was not very impressed mostly with the service.  Jonathan your unbuttoned shirt is not appealing. This is feedback for management.

We had an issue because construction was taking place outside so the restaurant GM asked them if they could take a break for a couple hours until we finished.    The construction team obliged and we bought them lunch.     We were completely floored by the initiative and cooperation from both sides.    Setting up the event was a breeze with Lindsay.   Kelly and Marv from the wait staff were also amazing.   We'll be back!   Thank you!!!",

We were probably sweaty, smelly, and underdressed but everyone we encountered was super friendly and welcoming. We decided to share the make-your-own antipasto plate and ended up making SEVERAL selections, none of which disappointed. Highlights include the strawberry, pistachio, and Brie, the grilled asparagus, and the crusty with olive oil and vinegar. Everything was fantastic though. We highly recommend!",

    "text": "I was visiting my friend in Tempe, AZ, and she had to work for the day, so I took a stroll to lunch by myself. This was only 6 or 7 blocks from her townhouse, so it was a perfect walk, and it was something we had not yet tried together.   Since I was alone, I decided to sit at the bar. There were about 10 other people at the bar, and the bartender was understandably busy. However, when someone who sat down after me was greeted before me, I got a little frustrated. I stared down the bartender, and we made eye contact. He came over and apologized for the wait and brought me a glass of sauvignon blanc and the menus.   They have a small plate menu that you can check the quantity of each item you want or write in what you want if it is not on there (entrees). It reminded me of a sushi restaurant. I asked him whether he liked the Kale and butternut squash salad or the Chicken gorgonzola salad better, and he recommended the Chicken gorgonzola salad, so I got that and the roasted brussel sprout small plate.   The brussel sprouts were cold, but so cold I assume they are meant to be served that way. They were drizzled with balsamic vinegar, and they were delicious. The chicken gorgonzola salad was also very good. All of the unique flavors combined together very well.   I loved the atmosphere. This place is huge! It would be interesting to see what it is like at night. I would definitely come back here if I was in the area.",

I recently went on a double date here-this place is perfect for any date occasion or meeting up with friends. The outside area is so entertaining we love all the games.   I strongly suggest trying the pretzel bites. Beware it comes with a basket full. I'm talking like 15 of them and they are not small. The cheese it comes with is white and they warm it with a candle. So yummy!!   After we all shared the pretzel bites and crusty bread (also yummy) we were basically full so my bf and I decided to split the Club sand which. We both liked it and they brought it to us on two separate plates cut perfectly in half with separate fries. Very accommodating!    Great food! Great fun!",

    "text": "I decided to give Culinary Dropout another chance and damn, I'm happy I did. I decided to go solo as I just wanted to eat not participate in a social gathering. I started out with the pretzel rolls and cheese fondue and those were perfect as they always are. I really love those things because there are always plenty to take with and enjoy at home the next day. As my second appetiser, I ordered a variety of things off of the checklist that is left on the table. It's a paper that reminds me of ordering sushi as far as checking off what you want and how many. Anyway, I ordered quite a few things and this is what they were (I did take a picture as well). Olives, brussel sprouts, capicolla (2 types) grilled asparagus, cheese that was so soft I could spread it with a fork on the bread, and the toasted bread slices that had their own variety of items on them as well. This I cannot forget. There was what I believe to be white raisins in a sweet \"sauce\" that was UNBELIEVABLE!!  It was just a tiny portion supposed to be more of a flavor accent and it was so good I could've eaten a small bowl of it. Just absolutely delicious!!! For the main item I had the Korean style ribeye cap. I ordered it medium rare and it was actually cooked exactly as requested. I don't know why but most restaurants can't seem to get medium rare cooked as requested but this was melt in your mouth, perfect! It was sweet with just a tiny tiny bit of spice to it. The combination was actually perfect as I don't like too much spice especially on beef. It came on an iron skillet with bean sprouts and zucchini and was thickly sliced. This ribeye was about perfect! For dessert I had the monkey bread. This was baked to order so there was a bit of a wait but the wait was worth every second. I'm sure most of you are familiar with this dessert but this was different in a good way. The reason I say that is because it's baked in its own tray and actually has chunks of fresh apple baked with it that are still crisp, crunchy, and sweet. The vanilla ice cream that comes with it in its own cup is delicious as well and is perfect to cool down each bite you take because as I said, this dessert comes fresh from the oven. I finished this off as well and enjoyed every single bite. I forgot to mention that my beverage of choice in addition to water was a new beer featured from Rogue Brewery called something 8. I'm sorry but the name escapes me right now. This beer had an 8.8% alcohol content and was smooth as butter. I say that because there are beers or ales out there with a similar alcohol  content but are harsh and actually unenjoyable to drink. This was the total opposite and was very very easy to drink. Great choice, Culinary Dropout!! I took some pictures this time of most of the items I mentioned and as you can tell, this dinner was a much better experience than the last time. My last trip just happened to be one of those nights where things just didn't click. This night they did and everything meaning the service, food, wait times, and just how everything worked out I guess you could say was spot on. I really had no complaints. I just went in with an open mind and let things work out as they would work out and I was happy. This is definitely a \"different\" restaurant in a good way and I think when you go in just have that open mind and you'll be happy as well. My servers name was Lisa and she did an excellent job as well. She was informative, attentive, and very nice. She had a great personality and sense of humor and was a pleasure to work with. Culinary Dropout, you have renewed my opinion about your establishment and again, I'm very happy I gave you another shot. My dinner and experience was awesome and I for sure recommend you to anyone out there!",

The Tempe location is quite large and we almost went in a wrong entrance (it looked like perhaps this was the entrance for private events?).   We had a reservation and were seated immediately, even though the restaurant was hopping on a Friday night.   I had one of the \"copperless\" moscow mules. It's disappointing not to have the mug, but the drink was mixed to perfection and garnished with a piece of candied ginger (yum!).  We started with the roasted brussel sprouts. They were delicious, but they are served cold (which was fine, but they should call that out because we were confused!). We also had the truffled potato chips, which were great. Both of these are fairly small portions, but enough for some light bites before the entree.  We then split the fried chicken and the turkey pastrami. Our server even arranged to have the dishes split for us (wow!) so we didn't have to manage that.   The fried chicken was alright, but I didn't bother to finish my half. The sides were great though. Honestly, I found the turkey pastrami on the pretzel roll to be the better entree.  We finished with the salted caramel custard, which was topped with caramel corn. Loved that!  Our server was awesome--friendly, gave his honest opinion on the dishes and helped us pick some great items. I'd definitely visit again!",

It was so inviting, the staff is always very nice and attentive no matter how busy they may be. Let me tell you, this place gets busy. Try to make a reservation if you can, or be prepared to wait awhile on busy nights.  Some of my favorite items on their menu are the meatloaf and fried chicken. I know, delicious meatloaf, what? It is SO good, you will not be disappointed. Secondly, the fried chicken has a honey glazed taste to it, which literally is making my stomach growl as I'm typing this. My all time favorite though- is the pretzels and fondue appetizer. This is my friend's and I's guilty pleasure, and after a hard week of studying, this is what I look forward to!",

It's great to see someone taking ownership and in such a timely manner. Just a simple, genuine apology has changed my opinion from never wanting to return to being open of a second chance here.  Unfortunately, while this apology does not make up for the embarrassing evening we had, it certainly changes my view on a restaurant earning one or less stars. Maybe this place is worth giving a second chance to, it's clear they care about the customer's experience; I just wish the management we spoke to at the restaurant was as considerate.",

I sipped it slowly, and wished I could have had a ton more. But I would have missed my appointments later that day.   I had a chicken sandwich without the bun, wrapped in lettuce, with a side of home made chips. I loved the chips and the sandwich. It was all solid food, nothing earth shattering but solid good food. I was extremely happy with my meal.    My girlfriend had a crispy shrimp salad and she gobbled up everything. She really enjoyed it. We both were very happy and will return.

He did even explain too how the menu works depending on what your were looking for like hearty or light and gave us some more recommendations. We went our own way but all the food was so good. And the monkey bread! I will always say get that as a dessert if you have room because it's perfect. They make it fresh for you so it's always hot and perfect with the ice cream.

Its basically beer roulette (I peeked, sue me) and I took the better out of the bunch and gave my three amigos the others.

Then, they sent another server over to remind us again 15 minutes later. Knowing very well they wouldn't kick us out of our seats, and we weren't done hanging out, we took our time and stayed. Around 7:30 a hostess came back to tell us that the party who reserved our table had arrived and we needed to leave. SO RUDE. If you have that many large reservations that calls for way better planning. Not being blatantly rude to your guests. Won't go back for a long time.

So be prepared! The seating within the restaurant is comfortable and eclectic. The crowd is diverse as well !   Service : Interesting to say the least ! She kept walking off in the middle of us ordering.   I  really could care less about service as long as you are bringing me my food.    Food : Pretzel and cheese fondue pretty damn good. The pork belly ramen was pretty bland. Then again I like my ramen spicy!   Pricing : Slightly more expensive than most of the restaurants in downtown Tempe. But the atmosphere makes up for the expensiveness in my mind. Also It's one of the nicest places in the area other than La Bocca and House of tricks.  Keep in mind this location is still pretty new , so they are still working out the kinks. Be kind :) and check it out !",

It's quite pricey for what it is, probably going to run you about $20-25 for a lunch and drink and we went for happy hour and it was about $85, nothing happy about that. HOWEVER, it has a great ambiance to it (industrial decor) and it's definitely a younger crowd - college age. They have cornhole and some other games in the yard. It is an outside eatery so it will be too hot to be there during summer months. I'd highly recommend the pretzel and cheese appetizer, delish! Other than that, not worth the money. It is very much a bar so do everyone a favor and don't bring your kids....that is, if they're even allowed.",

I wasn't that hungry so I ordered the Chili Thai Chicken Wing appetizer as my entree.  It was quite delicious with a nice balance of heat and sweet.  I was missing just a bit of garlic but that's it.  The slaw that accompanied the wings was also tasty.  My husband ordered the Bistro steak with potatoes and said it was outstanding.  The potatoes were cooked perfectly.  My daughter gave two thumbs up to the Fish & Chips.  Our dinner was topped off with Monkey Bread and Caramel Popcorn (two separate dishes).  Excellent all around.  Oh, and the live music was excellent too.  I would recommend and return to Culinary Dropout.",

So we stood there and watched the open tables and had a bunch of people seated before us.  Lo and behold, after waiting 15 minutes, we were seated at one of those open tables.  WHAT???  Insulting.  They never called us - apparently I was supposed to know they were going to text me; phone is in my purse and it is noisy in there so I didn't hear a thing. Finally seated and the waiter was great, but the typical wait way too long for the check and the payment processing.    The food was mediocre.  Appetizers over $10 and food over $20.  I had the nachos and they were okay - I wouldn't order them again.  Friend had the meatloaf and said it was good.  Two other friends had burgers and they were just ordinary - and very salty.   I have no idea why everyone loves this place.  The place is in Tempe, so the college crowd probably loves it.",

    "text": "I was privileged enough to be at Culinary Dropout's soft opening this past weekend. Sam Fox has done it again!!! What a great restaurant! The ambiance is very cool and casual. It caters to a 30's something crowd which is just what downtown Tempe needed.   The decor includes hanging lights, cozy couches with fire pits and murals of Johnny Cash and Freddie Mercury. There is ample space for large crowds or something a little more intimate, if you prefer.   Now for the food! My friends and I started with the pretzels and fondue. Sooo delicious!! Not quite ready for entrees, we ordered the cheese plate next. I highly recommended the goat cheese. It's perfect!  Entrees were finally decided. I chose the meatloaf. Most people wouldn't dare order something that \"only Mama can make\". I'm here to tell you this meatloaf will make you slap your Mama! It's that good! Savory and flavorful and a generous portion. The green beans were on point too. The mashed potatoes seemed to be the instant kind. Easy to overlook with that meatloaf begging to be devoured!  As for the cocktails, they left a little to be desired. I ordered a Moscow Mule. For $10 a drink, I expected a little more punch. Nonetheless, it was a great drink.  Finally, the service. Every person on the staff is friendly and courteous. They are all more than willing to tend to your needs. The only problem is, they blend in with the patrons. There is no uniform or name tag worn. You have to look for someone carrying dishes or drinks to know who they are.   Overall, this is a much needed addition for the City of Tempe. I highly recommend supporting this restaurant. You won't be disappointed!",

Very similar to Arrogant Butcher, especially when it comes to the delicious pretzel bun on the turkey pastrami, but those are not comparrisons to shy away from. The deviled eggs with prosciutto tasted fresh and the M.A.C. burger was simple, yet savory.",

They were surprised at the decor and lack of an employee dress code compared to the Scottsdale location. I loved the hipster-y vibe and outdoor games! Perhaps no employee dress code because they've recently opened? We weren't sure. Some of the outfits we saw servers wearing we'd hardly call appropriate for a nice restaurant like Culinary Dropout.  My family had reservations, so there was no wait once I arrived. We were seated in the main area with cool wooden tables. The metal chairs were cool but not comfy - my cousin and I were sad we didn't get the comfy-looking floral-patterned chairs.  Service could have been better - our girl was hit or miss with us - I saw her pay more attention to her other tables. It kind of was one of those nights where we saw her when we needed to order drinks/food, and then once they were delivered.  The food was amazing! Pretzel roll balls and the cheese sauce were great, ordered per my aunt and uncle. Everyone enjoyed their food, but the portion sizing seemed a bit off, comparing pricing/portion for my Ramen bowl to my mom's entree.  Overall cool place but some kinks should be worked out.",

    "text": "Got the fried chicken dinner, about $20 after tax and tip.  The gravy was VERY salty, as was the crust of the chicken.  I could handle it but I can imagine many could not.  The chicken was very juicy, though the two dark meat pieces were the best.  The crust was a little too oily and soggy on the bottom, and thinner than I prefer.  The mashed potatoes were very whipped and smooth, and I would've preferred more lumps.  They did not have any misters on over the outside seating which made it quite uncomfortable outside.  I also found the music too loud, which made conversation very difficult.  This Yard location does have much better parking than the Phoenix one, but you are forced to walk across a vast swath of roped off valet only spots to self-park.",

The fried chicken was probably the best or next to the best I've ever had, all time. It was amazing. Everyone else I was with loved their food. I also thought the grilled cheese sliders were great. They didn't try to over-fancify them. Just good, traditional grilled cheese.   It is a bit overpriced for what it is, but oh well. The menu didn't note that it was grass-fed or organic or anything, so I am not sure what kind of chicken it is to be so pricey.   It is a great atmosphere and delicious. I will definitely go back. Maybe next time 5 stars. I think they are still getting ramped up - I asked for a box and they threw away my food. They did make a completely full new meal for me and the waiter was super nice about it. The valet also took a pretty long time.",

As a first time patron at the Culinary Dropout, I have to say, I will not be returning not because of the food (by the way, the food was OUTSTANDING) but because of the our waitress. On a Friday night, one could expect to have a delay in being seated, having orders taken...but to wait 45 minutes for your drink to arrive after already waiting 15 minutes for your waitress to acknowledge our table, is ridiculous! On top of waiting, a lady in our group asked for her drink three times, in which the waitress walked away twice while the request was being made....I mean who does that? Oh and by the way, never ONCE was I offered a refill on my Diet Coke during the 2+ hours of being there.   Now on to the food, as stated above, the food is outstanding, however, due to our waitress not bringing our food out in a timely manner, my steak was cold. By this time, I had enough of the service issues and just wanted OUT.   The check arrives, and lone behold, it's wrong...waitress fixes the check, and proceeds to cash us out...our total bill for two is a little over $60, I hand the waitress a $100, and should have received $41.36 back in change....guess what, the waitress returns $41 and no change. So needless to say, your waitress should be thankful she kept the $.36 in change because that's $.35 more than what she was going to get from me.   I honestly hope the Culinary Dropout reviews this and either contacts me for more information  before this waitress is allowed to ruin what could be an amazing experience for others.",

Love the setting, music is fitting of the scene and I didn't feel like I had to talk over it while everyone working seems genuinely interested in making sure we were satisfied. What really stood out to me though was our server Nathan. He was on top of everything, very knowledgeable and personable while not overbearing. We were celebrating an occasion and weren't intent on mentioning it but it came up in conversation with him and he immediately recognized it and made sure we got everything to make the night special. I asked how long he had been there and was really surprised to hear he was new because I'd have guessed he'd been around awhile. If management sees this, seriously hold onto him because he was one of the best servers I've met throughout the valley and I would come back solely to have him as a server. Great style, good conversation, awesome recommendations. 10/10 for Nathan. Food was great but that's not all that makes an experience perfect. Thanks man.",

I like watching the food prep windows that let you see the kitchen action. They have a fun bar and lots of seating. Even in the AZ summer the outdoors seating area is pretty comfy with the Niagara Falls of spray misters going. Tip: reserve a spot on Open Table as this is a busy place.

Lots of ping pong tables and cornhole to keep the competitive juices flowing while the drinks from the outside bar keep coming. Ample seating inside and out. Drinks and food were delicious. I had the fried chicken and it was cooked to perfection! We came for my daughters 18th birthday and the staff couldn't be nicer. Btw, when washing your hands in the bathroom have a look between the sink and the mirrors.",

Brings back so many good memories of soft pretzels I had growing up and cheese that I wish I had growing up haha . They had cut up portions of different sandwiches and the turkey pastrami on a pretzel roll was fantastic. They also had a platter with most of their snacks/meats/cheeses. Altogether a very tasty charcuterie board. Thanks Culinary dropout for another delicious meal",

The food is more expensive though so if you are willing to pay for a trendy night out, then this is it. I had the pork belly nachos and it was super filling! It was HUGE! And the pork belly and chips and all of the ingredients tasted really good. It was about $13 which was one of the cheaper items on the menu if you don't count the small starters.  Oh yeah, two hour waits. Hmmm... well there is free parking in downtown Tempe which is rare!",

    "text": "I first visited Culinary Dropout one year ago on the suggestion of a friend, who told me that the establishment was founded and cooked for by actual culinary school dropouts (sounds like legend, but it's a fun story). On that first visit, I did not hesitate to order the storied pretzel appetizer and fried chicken entree. There was no doubt after dinner that I would be returning as often as possible.   Culinary Dropout boast a vibrant menu with some delectable options for light antipasti, to shareable appetizers, to exceptionally portioned entrees. Their beer and cocktail options are also more than satisfactory. It is True that to get the most out of your visit, you should expect a bill over $40, but I do believe you get what you pay for, and Culinary Dropout -- in my opinion -- abundantly deserves their daily patronage.   A moment of criticism (and I am glad somebody else mentioned this): the pretzel appetizer is too big, and there should be a regularly available, smaller option. Granted, it's an amazing way to start your visit, and I would usually never complain about a *big* portion size. However, I think it's more than reasonable to visit Culinary Dropout and expect to enjoy an appetizer here and there, and perhaps an entree to share. The pretzels will, I assure you, fill you to the brim before your entrees arrive. I had one kindly waitress once bring my girlfriend and I the \"happy hour\" portion, despite it not being happy hour. That was the best service we had received yet, and I am disappointed that other servers have not adopted the same style (we have since been advised to just get the full amount). It's a good move, Culinary Dropout, to offer a smaller portion size. Do consider it.   A side note that perhaps should have been brought up to our server at the time (but we had a plane to catch right after): during our last dinner experience, we received one of our favorite dishes -- the pirogi appetizer -- but it was stone cold in the center! We did not recall it being cold, let alone *that* cold, the last few times we had ordered it. Once again, however, we were in a hurry, so we did not bother bringing it up. Neither of us died either, so I suppose there was no harm in the matter. If it happens again, though, we will definitely bring it up.   Nevertheless, I do think very highly of Culinary Dropout, and I am looking forward to my next visit. There is still much on the menu I have yet to explore. To those of you who have yet to swing by, I strongly recommend the buffalo wings, meatloaf, fried chicken, and ravioli dishes. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Sadly, this place is really overhyped. It's definitely \"cool\" and I could see why it'd be fun to drink here. It's a really big space and you can rent out the rooms for events or parties. They definitely have a very laidback atmosphere and let their servers wear whatever they want. It's all very interesting and nontraditional.  I was pretty let down by the service, however. They seemed to forget about us when we checked in for a table, saying that they were just cleaning out the tables and it would just be a moment. But the hostesses seemed to have gotten really distracted because their friend arrived or something? After a while, we got up to remind them about us (lol) and then they immediately seated us... I noticed a lot of tables were cleaned by then too..  Next strike was when they forgot our appetizer. They told us it would be out in a moment, then suddenly our entrees were served. We followed up twice before the brussell sprouts finally arrived - and by then we had already finished most of our entrees. We were told that the reason for the delay was because they didn't know if they had any brussell sprouts left. Which didn't make sense to me, honestly, because why would our server say they'd be out in a second shortly after placing the order? I think they just forgot or gave it to another table lol.  Lastly, the food is overpriced and nothing to write home about. I honestly think that because the ambiance is so \"hip\" and cool, people think that the food here is better than it really is...  I'm pretty disappointed.",

All three visits have been phenomenal! The menu isn't huge but offers a ton of variety. They also have a great happy hour! My husband and I are obsessed with the pretzel bites (more like pretzel balls). They are hands down the best I've ever had. I also highly recommend the bbq pork nachos. They don't skimp on the toppings and the queso mixed with the bbq is next level.  On our last visit, I ordered the spicy vegan curry per our waitresses suggestion, and WOW. It was seriously incredible. It wouldn't have been my first choice, but now it might be my go-to meal! It was hearty and full of flavor. I was also lucky enough to receive a birthday dessert! It was the apple cinnamon monkey bread with vanilla bean ice cream. It came out hot and sizzling. The ice cream did taste a little freezer burned, but it wasn't too bad once mixed with the hot cinnamon bread.  I can't recommend this place enough! I would eat here every day if I could!",

It definitely helped especially having kids in our group! Overall good service a little on the slower side but it was Memorial Day so I'm sure it was much busier than a normal Monday afternoon.. All of the food was so good, and no one got anything they didn't like! We had 7 entrees and 3 appetizers so we definitely got a good feel for the menu! As far as pretzel bites go theirs are very good and I love that they give a candle under the cheese fondu because at other places I've noticed it can get colder quickly! I will definitely be coming back, it seems like a great place for a Friday night to get dinner and hang out!",

    "text": "Met friends here for dinner last night. We were seated, told it was still happy hour, given the happy hour menu as well as the regular menu. By the time our absentee waitress showed up it was to late to order drinks from the happy hour menu so we went with the regular. Love the pretzel bite appetizers. The rest of the food, meat loaf, fried chicken and fish and chips were just average. The restaurant itself is to dark and gloomy, we were seated directly in front of the kitchen so it was to noisy to have a conversation and the banquet we were seated at needs to be replaced as it is worn out. Why do restaurant owners think that their guest want to hear all the noise from the kitchen? I go out to eat with friends to visit with them, something you can't do here with out yelling across the table.",

We had the fried Brussel sprouts, prosciutto and cheese, potato chips with onion dip as appetizers. Then we had fish and chips and Thai wings. EVERYTHING here is RIDICULOUSLY good. Not to mention the drinks are perfectly made. We had the After School Special and a few others I can't remember. For dessert, Jack surprised us with a delicious monkey bread style dessert! Being from California, I get a lot of out of state visitors and I can't wait to bring them all in for a laid back night full of tasty drinks and great food.",

Overall very unimpressed with the restaurant and the attention we received and would not recommend for sit down food service.

Fire pits, an eclectic mishmash of chairs, great lighting, shuffleboard, ping pong -- a cool vibe. Great for happy hour or to watch a game as there are a ton of TVs. The crowd is more on the young side and feels kind of Scottsdale like. It gets very very very crowded, so if you want to get a table get there early. The food is eh. Not bad, but not great. But also not overly priced so I guess it balances itself out. They also have love music on weekends which is a plus!",

    "text": "So we went on a Friday night and their valet service sucked! Awful.  The hostess uses text messaging to tell you if your table is ready which is an excellent option, and one more places should use.  There was about an hour wait for a table so we went back to the bar in the cube, and service was slow until a guy named Matt came and took our order and was easily the high point of the nite.   If you see a happy bartender with a bushy beard, and he is taking care of you, you will know you are in good hands.  We didn't get service from a server, but our busboy went out of his way to keep our water filled and empty glasses and coors lites off the table, which in some places is a forgotten art but not here.  Our bartender Matt recommended the turkey sammich which was great, the Thai wings and nachos were also good.   In conclusion, I walked in with a real shitty opinion of the place because of their valet service, and left knowing Matt the best employee in the building, and California the busboy and they made up for everything and then some.",

James came over and apologized and said he would make sure the food came fast. I was in the service industry for 5 years he could have at least offered an appetizer or small discount.

Had brussel sprouts for an appetizer which I never thought I would and they were, in fact, delicious. Had their kale salad and topped it with salmon steak which was Perfection. Their fried chicken is good, it looks like it's over cooked, but it's not, it was really juicy but it's kind of sticky. Mashed potatoes and gravy were okay, but kind of surprised their coleslaw was a little plain given that everything else was so flavorful.  Did learn a lesson - if you order drinks, wait till they arrive before you order your food. We ordered cocktails and they did not show up until we were 2/3 done with our dinner, not the time I usually enjoy a cocktail. Cocktails were delicious, but still the flow of service wasn't really in place. However, our waitress was nice and accommodating and the manager came over, they comped a piece of their yummy banana cream pie. So definitely going back just now know wait for drinks, then food.",

And while, yes it was very loud it was a fun and vibrant atmosphere.  The service was fantastic.  I've found some \"hipster\" places to also have what I refer to as \"rude hipster too cool for school service.\"  However this was not the case with Culinary Dropout.  Our service was fantastic.  Our server offered great suggestions and checked on us frequently.  We ordered: deviled eggs, balsamic beets and the grilled bread.  The eggs and beets were both fantastic.  The bread had amazing flavor but was too crunchy and tore up my mouth.  My husband had the fried chicken, and although it's not as fabulous as fried chicken in Atlanta, it was delicious.  He loved the honey drizzle and the huge buttery biscuit.  The portion size was just right for a big, filling dinner.  I ordered the Korean steak and it was prepared perfectly and had an explosion of sweet and spicy flavor.  It was fantastic.  I'm so glad I ordered the bread because it definitely needed a carb to soak up the sauce and balance out the sweet heat.    We will be back, with friends soon!  I better brush up on my ping pong skills too",

The Kale salad contained perfectly mixed hints of sweetness with sprints of tart and bitter emanating from the kale and goat cheese.  While the dressing was light and slightly lemony.  As far as the meatloaf goes -way above the standard but not exceptional -exceptional, tangy, sufficient portioned, tomato and vinegar-based red sauce on top but the meat itself was just slightly above average for the caliber of the restaurant.  I ordered the Brussels sprouts.  I lived in Germany for two years, and have eaten brussels sprouts throughout Europe and America. Most restaurants have no idea how to make brussels sprouts the favorite spot on the dinner plate.  Let me just say this much, the culinary dropout is where you go to taste brussels sprouts if you want to like them. I also had the pork ribs which were also delectable.",

The second time I went in with a group of friends on a Saturday night. It was pretty busy and we didn't see a hostess so naturally we sat our selves. After waiting a while without service, I had to go to the bartender to get a server for us. Aside from that little hiccup, everything was great and service was good.

We asked security if we could get a manager to the table and no one ever showed up for about an hour and a half until after we had ate already and my girlfriend complained and talked to head of security, then one of the three managers offered us free food after we paid. The security guard also stated they have been open 7 months and don't want to ruin their reputation. I have never heard of any rules against anyone with a mental disorder being in a restaurant.",

But it's the atmosphere I really like. There is SPACE everywhere. High loft ceilings, used brick walls, open bars with acres of room in between tables, lots of very attractive wait-staff and 80\" flat screen TVs to watch if you're eating by yourself. This place has huge tables for large groups, small intimate settings with fire pits, and even a game toss area in back. It's the kind of hip place you feel comfortable going to if you're by yourself, young or old, or with a large group of friends. Great experience and does not feel like any other restaurant you've been to... !",

While eating our dinner my husband let me know the burger was really rare but being that he has worked in the restaurant business for a long time we did not complain. After dinner we all decided to play bags (cornhole) we got up from our dinner where we left our stuff just to have someone bus our table and give it away. Again, we did not complain and our server that night was super cool and continued to serve us over by the game. Half way through a game my husband says he feels sick from the food and goes to the bathroom. While waiting for him some people walk over to our bags game and the guy very rudely tells us we can't hold the board. We explain to him that my husband was in the bathroom and we will be playing shortly he then says \"I don't really care you can't hold the board\" I probably got snippy back and replied my husband is going to the bathroom just walk away when his girlfriend steps in and says \"you need to calm down\" the man causing a scene then let's me know he's the assistant general manager and he can do whatever he wants. He tells my party and I this multiple times before walking away. Strike three..... We will not be returning and will take our business elsewhere. Bad food bad communication and bad management.",

I can still taste it, it was to die for! It comes with pretzel bites, but any bread will do. If you are ever there, please do yourself a favor and order the provolone fondue!

The evening started out with my reservation of 12 turning into a party of 22, while most servers would flip out or become agitated Michael just maintained composure. Seriously this guy has mastered the art of multitasking!   The food was fresh, delicious and super hot when it came to our table. There were so many people I felt like I got to try everything on the menu. I sampled the wings, salad and a bite of the burger, all of which were amazing. But let's be honest the pub burger with bacon and bbq sauce was where the money was at.   It's not a question of if I'll go back to this place, it's a matter of when.

Culinary Dropout is located in a huge building with indoor and outdoor seating.  You can make reservations, but who would have thought on a Tuesday night at 7pm there would still be a 30 minute wait to be seated.  The resturant was alive with lots of activity. Loud music tonight and a really good mix of young and old enjoying their meals.  I already posted the menu.  How can you not want to try a place called Culinary Dropout? We got seated quicker than 30 minutes and Wyatt our waiter was right there  getting our drink orders and explaining the menu. We were sitting at a round wooden table with really comfortable chairs. The atmosphere is very fun, but loud. What do you expect from a packed restaurant.  I could hear my husband so the noise level didn't interfere with our conversation.  Dinner OMG, we started with the pretzels and cheese. About 20 soft round pieces of pretzel which just about melted in your mouth.  I got the meatloaf which was the best meatloaf I have had in the Phoenix area.  My husband had a late lunch and he had the grinder. We really enjoyed ourselves.  They do have live music and other events.  I definitely want to go back with a whole group of friends. Good food, great services (thanks Wyatt) good times.",

Anyway, I LOVE the atmosphere here wherever you sit. Indoors is a little fancier, and you'll wait for a seat while outside is first come first serve. The few times I have been, there has been live music inside, which is a nice touch. As a tip, the tables towards the middle are of the outside patio are cooler than those on the outside. There are corn hole boards, ping pong tables, couches, and comfortable seating outside where it truly feels like a backyard party.   Food: Overall, the menu is a little lackluster for me. There are few options, and the portions are small for the price, but it is still tasty. The food is good, but the dessert is better. This is where their menu truly shines. I promise you, you won't regret ANY of those three lovely desserts.  Drinks: Ok, so a glass of their cheapest wine is the price of a bottle of wine, so I would avoid ordering wine unless you want to show off. Their mixed drink menu is where you should focus your attention. They have a variety of \"mules\" that you should get. All of them. In one sitting. Then call a lyft because no drinking and driving, friends.  Anyway, this is definitely a fun, interactive bar that can accommodate many different types of personalities.",

    "text": "This has been a regular place for lunch for a number of friends for several years now. We were there yesterday for lunch and were blasted by the volume of the music, both in the main area and in the open area where we were seated. We found ourselves actually yelling to have a conversation. And in case you thought it was just us, the 20 somethings seated next to us were equally frustrated.   We asked our server if she could see if the music could be toned down just a bit. She said she agreed, that she couldn't even hear her customers order. She came back, apologized and informed us that the manager said it couldn't be turned down!     So Culinary Dropout, you've lost us as customers. It is a shame, the food is good and the service has always been great, but I am not about to drive 12 miles to have lunch in a place where the management could care less about the comfort of their guests.",

    "text": "I like the business of the place and the sass of the staff, but the food is over priced for the item. Fried chicken should not cost $22 a plate. I am totes down to drop that on a steak, but not on chicken that I can probably make better at home. I didn't have the chicken, I had the pub burger which was the normal cost of a burger and fry at a restaurant.   My thought is that they should have smaller options at a lower cost. The obesity problem in America is from places like this that over charge, so the person gorges themselves to get \"their money's worth\". Where are the tapas? With a name like Culinary Dropout I expected smaller dishes.  Final note, I also hate how their valet is on the side of the railroad track instead of on Ash as it used to be. Do you guy have any idea the dangers your poorly located entrance causes because people do not signal???? 3 times this week idiots have slammed on their breaks as I cross the track the bust a U turn to get into the valet.   As a local resident of the area, I am sick of nearly getting into an accident when I am within 1000FT of my residence.",

Very hipster feel to the restaurant and they have live music. At night it's beautifully lit outside and not at all hot, even during the hottest time of the year. This restaurant is huge!  3. Customer service was on par! Especially for someone like me who is on crutches :(. They helped me out by opening doors and clearing a walk for me. AND did I mention how gorgeous every work is? Lol. For such a big restaurant they were well staffed. Our waitress did an excellent job.  4. as for food, I had the Mac burger. It was amazing!!! It's like a McDonald's Big Mac but taste a million times better! I loved it.  5. This restaurant is unique. If you are a tourist, this is a must go to place.   All in all, this restaurant had everything, a great crowd, a great decor and atmosphere, amazing customer service, and the food was exceptional.  Oh AND it's right downtown Tempe but has free parking for their guest!!",

    "text": "Writing this review is making me want to go eat there again. right now. I've been meaning to try Culinary Dropout since it opened in 2014 since it's always been only a mile away. I FINALLY got to try it and I'm so glad I went.   My favorite thing about CD is the interior. From the outside, it looks like a shed with empty spaces, which is honestly what I was expecting. I was blown away the minute I walked in because I was surprised with a long low-lit hallway (I know it sounds sketchy) which led into the great dining area. The light fixtures hanging from the top were so so nice, and the red couches, and the curtains, and the game area, the high ceiling, the bar...I could go on and on. The music was great, some songs I had never heard of before and some that I have. The games area and the patio were closed off for a private event so we didn't get to see it.   The next best thing is the food. My friend and I were a little worried about what we would eat because I was always told by peers that CD is expensive. However, it was apparently Happy Hour when we got there. We ordered the Grilled Cheese Sliders, BBQ Pork Belly Nachos, Thai Chile Chicken Wings, and Fresh Hand-cut Fries--listed in the order I liked them the best. The sliders were the absolute best!  The perfect amount of crisp and softness and the cheese oh my gosh. The nachos plate was HUGE and the pork was cooked to perfection with amazing flavor. My mouth is currently watering. The wings were tangy but not overly, with a little spice. The meat was soft and the pieces were big. I did have one problem though-on two of my pieces the meat inside was a under cooked--it was really really pink/almost red (hence the lack of one star). The fresh were soft and just right with the salt. The sliders, nachos, and fries were from the happy hour menu which I definitely encourage taking advantage of.    We went around 3 pm on a Tuesday and it was relatively quiet and not full. It is a little on the pricier side compared to other restaurants on campus, but rightfully so because of the type of place it is. It looked like they would be able to accommodate numerous groups due to the large space. Our server, Ash, was fantastic! All the other servers and the hostess were really friendly and helpful. I look forward to coming back here again when I'm starving as I had a lot of leftovers because of the size of the dishes!   TLDR; Fabulous place for yourself, groups, dates, casual/business lunches/dinners etc. Yummy food in great quantities. Happy Hour. Amazing servers. Pretty lights.",

    "text": "The atmosphere is incredible, the customer service is amazing, and the food is fantastic.  I came here with my girlfriend for Labor Day, and from the moment we walked into the store we were impressed.  As starters, we ordered the Prosciutto Di San Daniele as a Meat Antipasti, and combined it with the Garlic & Herb Goat Cheese, which was a wonderful combination.   She ordered the Italian Grinder, and I ordered the Fried Chicken. Both were great, especially the Italian Grinder. I actually enjoyed her meal more than I did mine, although both were very tasty.  After all this food, I decided to order the Grilled Cheese Sliders (apparently my eyes were bigger than my stomach) and I couldn't eat them. Half of the reason was because I was pretty full, and the other half was they just didn't taste that good. My expectations were soooo much greater than what actually came to the table. They make them sound and look way better than they actually are. Three tiny little grilled cheeses with a quarter of a slice of bacon in them, which apparently are supposed to have tomato as well, according to all the other reviews I've read on here, but mine didn't come with any; alongside an ungodly amount of French Fries, which I can't really complain about, because their fries are amazing.  Overall, I am very pleased with this restaurant. The food (for the most part) tastes great, and the atmosphere is really cool. Plus, they have $3 Sangrias for happy hour! Unfortunately however, $10 for that unimpressive Grilled Cheese Slider plate is gonna cost you guys a star. I will definitely be back though for that Italian Grinder.",

    "text": "Even on a Friday night at 8:30, we were seated within 5 minutes (we booked a reservation online for 9 PM). Our server, Martin, was wonderful. He remembered details of our order, was friendly and attentive when he needed to be. Very cool atmosphere, although I left with half my hearing and half my voice from the extreme noise. Not to sound like a 90-year-old telling them to tone down that racket, but the music was so loud and we were seated at an awkward 2-top in between other tables. Thus between the large party next to us on either side within inches and the music a few feet away, all we could do is stare awkwardly at each other and text from across the table to communicate. Now, that's a hot date!   The music was good and started just after 9 PM on a Friday(picture of stage). I wish they had placed the stage in the patio/party area and built a designated little dance floor because we would have jammed out for a bit since we couldn't talk or function with the noise otherwise.   I ordered a classic mule drink (which was not as sweet as usual elsewhere) and my husband got the brown bag special(a random, surprise can of beer). This was a cool, cheap concept and you get to try a beer you otherwise would not have picked. He liked it a lot!   Due to the soft pretzel hype and our unhealthy love of fake cheese, we got the pretzel app. Wanted to love it but were disappointed. The cheese wasn't melted or warm and had no flavor. The pretzels were much bigger than anticipated (more like small roll size) and were a good consistency. Unfortunately, they didn't have any flavor. Quick dip in butter or salt would have added a little something.   For entrees, we had fish and chips and the pub burger. The burger was juicy and flavorful with an awesome smokey taste to the meat. The fish was pretty good with a bit of a spice, but the slaw was probably the best part of the dish. Both meals came with cold, seasoning-free, limp fries that had clearly been sitting for awhile and a tiny tin bowl with a squirt of ketchup. I would recommend a different side.   We were bummed that all of the bags and ping pong areas were taken. Assuming these are open more frequently at off peak times of day. As an FYI, we were carded twice for entry. Not sure if this is only for weekends or other times as well. Food runners seemed very disorganized. We were asked three times if an item they were holding was something we ordered. They asked all the tables around us.   Overall, we are glad we tried this place but are not itching to go back...at least not on a weekend when it is so loud and busy.  We were not impressed enough with the food for the price.",

The food came out quickly, we had a pretzel appetizer - delicious!  My kale salad was out of this world (it is hard to get excited about a salad, but this one makes me want to go back for more.  Everyone at the table enjoyed their entrees.  I did not have any brews, but I heard good feedback.  The prices seem to be very much in line.  Plenty of parking available.  Will be back for more, for sure!",

My three star review is the average experience we've had so far at Culinary Dropout.    The facility is fantastic.  They have some of the hippest bathrooms I've ever seen.  I want that grey geometric tile in my bathroom at home.  The sangria, especially the red, goes down way too easy, so we make sure we come by for happy hour.  I love the spicy thai wings and the peanut slaw they sit on top of.  It's a great place to watch a game or just hang out with friends and talk.  The Happy Hour is one of the best in Tempe.  On our most recent visit, we were ignored for 30 minutes while our server seemed to be stolen from the area by a huge table on the patio outside.  No one else came to check on us or ask us if we'd like to order food.  We eventually flagged a random server down to get our check.  That experience left a bad taste in our mouths that I hope will never be repeated.",

Every time I've been here they have amazing music. Def not top 40 in such a good way.   The waitress I had was super aware of us and always was bringing refills right when we needed them. The kids played ping pong and had a good time.   The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 was because of the table around the fire pit. Super relaxed outdoor feel. It's really cozy when you're hanging out and talking. But when your food comes I feel like Mia Khalifia having to bend over to eat my food. Mildly uncomfortable. It didn't  sabotage my experience. It just wasn't a 5 star experience.   Good food and great vibes.  Will recommend to everyone!",

Gotta get the soft pretzels and cheese...plus my favorite mule, the dropout classic. It comes with candied ginger and is just really tasty. I love the aesthetic of the restaurant and the games outside (when it's cool). Awesome concept.",

The atmosphere was pretty good. The food was pretty good as well, I got the fried chicken. The sides were fantastic, the appetizer of pretzel bites was great as well.   The only real disappointment with the food was I wasn't a huge fan of the fried chicken. It seemed almost sweet. But it was cook perfectly, just cause my palette didn't agree doesn't mean it's wrong.   The big let down here was the service. We were in on a slow night, in a pretty slow section but service seemed disoriented almost. We sat down, got a menu, and our server walked away. After that she came back and asked if we wanted any appetizers, and we ordered and she walked away again for the second time without taking our drink orders. I had to ask for drinks when she came back with the appetizers. After the appetizers, she took our orders and we didn't see her again until entree's came out, and again I had to request another drink without being asked.  I've worked in the service industry a number of years and it just was over all very underwhelming. THe service lacked attentiveness on a seemingly slow night.",

The food looks pretty on your plate but the flavor and quality doesn't come close to the price.   The place is large and was extremely crowded on a Thursday night so they're doing something right but anyone that says they go there for the food probably dropped out of culinary school themselves.",

I absolutely LOVE the decor, ambiance, vibes, and music in this place. Definitely a place with heart and soul. I dig it.  Service: We arrived late (sorry!) and were still seated rather promptly. Staff and service and great. Shoutout to our awesome server who's from Napa, CA. The dude was wearing a green t-shirt...but so was everyone else on St. Pattys Day :P He was top-notch. I'd give 5 stars for service. He was friendly and really attentive. Drinks refills were appreciated.    APPETIZERS:    - Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue: giant soft pretzel bites that have the perfect amount of sea salt and flavor perfect for dipping into your cheese fondue pot. A bajillion times YAAAAAS! Super filling you'll feel fat & happy. - Hot Wings: Culinary Dropout, you shouldn't include \"Hot\" in the title if you can't bring the heat. We both know they can be hotter! They're good, just not hot.  DRINKS: Y'all don't mess around here! Definitely worth a shot.  ENTREES: I was bummed to find out you ran out of grilled steak tacos :'( - Meatloaf served with mashed potatoes and green beans: good stuff, especially if you are a meatloaf lover - Tuna and chicken salads are both VERY GENEROUS portion sizes. Honestly not sure I necessary liked the taste and flavors of them, but there's a lot to eat if you do (-1/2 star) - Steak: nicely cooked, fabulous plating and presentation. Too bad it was served cold (-1/2 star)  DESSERT:  - Monkey Bread: Sooooo good! I wish I had left more room in my belly to enjoy and finish all of it by myself!",

I'm giving this place 4 stars is because the food just didn't quite hit it for me.  I had the steak tacos, my bf got the meatloaf, and the cheddar and potatoes pierogies! The only thing that was really good was the cheddar and potatoes pierogies and that's it. The steak was really dry and they give you a big bowl of beans for only 3 small tacos.  The meatloaf was really dense and dry as well, and the mashed potatoes tasted like they were instant mashed potatoes.  Overall, the food wasn't worth the price but the atmosphere is worth the visit!!",

Absolutely ridiculous.  In my opinion, unless you're meeting a group for drinks, people did look like they were having fun, go somewhere, anywhere else.  Just way overpriced for what you get.  Updated:  I received a very nice reply from Ez of Culinary Dropout.  I'm sure the ingredients are fresh, the tacos were delicious, just way overpriced.  And there was no message left for me as stated.  Thank you.  Updated second time:  I received a most courteous response from Ez of Culinary Dropout once again.  This type of response indicates, to me, a big commitment to the business and I would like to give this restaurant another try.  Again, the place is so nice and it was clear others were enjoying themselves, as we were.  Thank you again to Ez and Culinary Dropout.",

The lights were so cool, and I loved the rustic wooden feel of the place.  One friend ordered the grilled steak tacos (which came with a small side of beans), another got the butternut squash ravioli (super rich), and I got the pesto shrimp orecchiette. Everything was SO. GOOD. Decent number of shrimps, and the pesto was delicious. The portions are average, but the quality of the food was A+.  I also got the $11 Between You and Me (vodka, grapefruit, cranberry, & lemon) - a little pricey but it was delicious. Our waitress mentioned how each cocktail has one ingredient that is made in-house, ex. infused simple syrup. Their beer selection was pretty decent (drafts and cans).  We were seated one table away from the live band when they started at 7pm so it was harder to chat, but they were great. Check their website for dates/times of live music! The outdoor lounge area looked so relaxing after the sunset so will def have to come again to check that out. Also, it's a short walk to Tempe Beach Park, and I'd highly recommend a quick stroll after your meal/drinks at CD.",

I ordered the pesto shrimp and it had so much shrimp and the pasta was perfect and the pesto was above and beyond. My friend ordered the crispy shrimp caesar salad and that was fried perfectly and paired so well with the caesar. We also ordered a few drinks and we had some help with deciding and he was great! To top it all off, we got an order of their monkey bread and it was something I would order again and again. The bread was ooey gooey in a cast iron skillet with apple chunks. On the side you get this perfect scoop of french vanilla ice cream. Overall I'm so happy we got to try this place!",

Not a stranger to this location or their other valley-wide location, I have always enjoyed myself at Culinary Dropout. This isn't even the first Culinary Dropout review I've written! As such, I won't give you a play-by-play on all the dishes I've consumed but here are some highlights:  You can't go wrong with the Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue. If you're getting an entree with fries, keep the cheese and use it to dip it in. \"Ma... The Meatloaf!?!\" is also a good classic dish. Who can say no to a Wedding Crashers reference anyways? The Fried Chicken is also pretty darn tasty. All they need to make the fried chicken better is to offer some spicy honey on the side. *kisses fingertips* As for the cocktails, they're all pretty darn good in their own ways but depending on who makes it, it can be either weak as a guy getting his first prostate exam or stiff like an opossum faking death. There never seems to be an in between.  Anyways, a good note for this location is that they have a back bar area for 21+ called, \"The Coop.\" If you hear your host or hostess mentioning that they want to seat you here, run! We were seated in The Coop on a warm 101F Saturday evening and no amount of swamp/evaporative cooler and ceiling fans could keep us cool. Although this place is GORGEOUS once the sun goes down.  So yeah, get your butt over here and become Culinary Dropout alumnus too! Happy Hour is from 3PM-6PM, Monday-Friday.  ;)",

So we took a shot and ordered new items, my wife got the shrimp pasta, and I got the Italian grinder. She enjoyed her pasta but it was nothing special. I was the one who was not satisfied. I have attached a picture to help illustrate how underwhelming this sandwich was (and it was $12!). It was mostly bread and veggies, with one slice of cheese and a couple of slices of meat. Our server Daniela was awesome and took care of all of our needs. If we return it will be solely for drinks, apps, and ambience.",

We got the pretzel bites and cheese fondue and pork belly nachos as apps. Honestly, I thought the pretzel bites were better than the nachos!   For my entree I got the sweet corn ravioli. Initially was disappointed as I thought the ravioli would be stuffed with the corn rather than accompanied by it. Then I tasted it. Oh my gosh. Delicious. Unbelievable honestly. A friend got the Korean rib eye cap which was perfectly cooked. Another friend said the ribs were amazing too.   We finished it off with the rocky road brownie bar - it came with salted caramel ice cream. Even after all the other great food I couldn't stop eating it. I'll only be in Phoenix for two weeks but I may have to come back again, it was that good. Highly recommend.",

My account team had a reservation on an early Thursday evening and by the time we left this joint was packed and hopping.  First off, this space is beautiful. Large, open, airy, simple, but yet cozy. There's a large games area to the right and private dining rooms to the far left. In the center, is a massive bar with surrounding seating. I had a few Sangrias(on their Happy Hour special), which were excellent and recommended. I ordered the Seared Tuna Salad and had a few dips of the Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue. All of these dishes I would order again in a heartbeat.   Our waitress was wonderful. Charming, personable and quick to act. Parking, from what I understand, is challenging later in the evening.",

Only one word comes to mind when I think of my experience here: happy.   I was so very happy.  I love a comfortable, friendly, and unique dining experience and this place has it all.  It offers a fresh take on all aspects of the atmosphere. For example, I love how stylishly and uniquely the servers are dressed. And there're all so accommodating and interesting to talk to. Loved my server (who I hope went to her prom like I told her to the next day).   I showed up earlier than my friend to get some work done and they gave me a lovely spot despite knowing it would be awhile before ordering dinner. Then they were even more gracious about my friend being super late. I stayed there several hours and felt welcome every minute of it.  And the cheese... and the pretzel bites, and the nachos, and the cocktails... oh my.  Anyone who's local knows this is a great spot, but if you're visiting, trust that this is a must-attend.",

My daughter had the ribs and raved about them and my husband had the fried chicken. Everything was great. They offered a free dessert for the birthday girl, nice touch. It was amazing. I had a sangria cider, it was also delicious. Very niche and unique place, definitely give them a try.",

Since it is hot out, I prefer sitting inside, however there are water stations outside so that you don't die of thirst. The management and the staff are very friendly and helpful. They all just looked happy to be there and although it was busy, they worked together to get through it. Good sign of a good working environment.   For my appetizer, I looked on yelp for some recommendations. For my meal, I definitely recommend sharing the Fried Chicken with someone. That plate can easily be shared with how much food is piled on it. It is very good and helps cut the cost!   Just a tip, don't park in the most south of the lot before 6pm! The signs are small but it is permit restricted until 6pm and you can acquire a pretty hefty ticket.",

We had a group of three so we decided to share everything.   Wheewww- the nachos were to die for!! Love love love them. The soft pretzels and beer cheese were also amazing. We also had the Korean Brussels sprouts. Very good as well.   If I'm ever back in Tempe, will definitely be coming back.",

We ordered some appetizers. I love their fried chicken. It is very saucy, consistency is good and tastes great. I didn't need ranch to dip into my chicken because the chicken itself is perfect. I ordered fish and chips on the menu and a French fries for my kid. Nothing special about the fish and chips. It tasted okay. Same as everybody's fish and chips I've had. Their serving is pretty huge. Their side French fries was a whole bowl. Customer service is fast. Their waitress were friendly and efficient.   Overall, everything is good. I would recommend this place if you would like to chill with friends and enjoy a drink and some appetizers.",

I think their salads are the best thing in the menu and I am never disappointed when I order one. I also think the best appetizer is the pretzel bread cheese fondue. I've been here multiple times but my most recent trip, I ordered the steak salad. The cost is 19 dollars but inclusive of a bed of lettuce, corn, tomatoes, avocados, onions, and croutons. It is topped with a tasty steak in which you can choose how you want it cooked.  The decor and setup is cute and conducive for big parties. There are also games you can okay. Whether you come here for HH, dinner or brunch on the weekends, you won't be disappointed here.   Lastly, the Tempe location has private rooms so this would be great for events!",

The Pork Belly Nachos (more please), the Parmesan Brussel sprouts (yes!), some charcuterie (cheese & meats oh my!). My main entree was the ramen. Very good!! The service was excellent. I had my 9 month old with me, and the servers were very attentive and friendly with her and brought our her food right away. Even though I live closer to the Scottsdale location, I can't wait to return to this one very soon. The only thing that need improving is the parking situation, but in time I am sure it will be less confusing.",

Both were excellent and the portions are more than generous.   This place is huge, spacious and has cool bar and game areas, lots of outdoor seating.  There are also plenty of tvs to watch for sports fans.",

The only down side is that it is on the pricey side and as good as the food is, I'm not sure it's worth the amount we spent. Will probably go back for drinks and apps!",

The manager spoke to us directly and addressed the last time we were here and told us that tonight was on him. Our appetizers, main course, and drinks were all out very quickly and were delicious. Our server Payne was great and very friendly. The pork ribs were unbelievable. They were cooked to perfection, the barbecue sauce was delicious, and the meat was so tender it was literally falling off the bone. After dinner they recommended the Monkey Bread for dessert. This is a cinnamon apple bread with ice cream and it was to die for. All in all, this experience was great and because of tonight we will be coming back soon. They took care of us and showed that the customers are their number one priority.",

When we asked he said that the smoked salmon was $5 not the roasted but he didn't bother to tell me that when I ordered.  He also pushed a dessert, the bourbon pie that was very lame.

When you first pull up it can be a little intimidating because there aren't any empty spots to park in, but luckily they have complementary valet and those guys are really nice and do a great job taking care of your car. I went in to get a table (very spacious -- loved that) and they told me it would be an hour wait and at first I was hesitant on staying and I'm glad I did because I was seated within 10-15 minutes of my arrival. If you decide you want to wait outside (as I did) they will text your phone when your table is ready. I had the cheese sliders and fries and they are soooo good! I also played it safe with the cocktails and ordered vodka and cranberry juice which was made to perfection. Everything went well with the exception of our waitress shorting me $10 on my change, but I quickly forgave her for the mistake (I hope it was a mistake). A lot of the people there (you college aged) were casual and some were really dressed up (a little older working class) and I felt so underdressed because I had scrubs on (came straight from work). I was able to get sliders, fries, and two cocktails for only $20 during happy hour... Not too bad! I highly recommend this place for a girls night or a group outing.",

The custom drinks were all excellent although the bartenders at the front (main) bar were at times inattentive and aloof. If you want to get away from the crowd go to the back bar (The Coop) - better service and calmer atmosphere. For Antipasti - the meat and cheese tray was delicious (make sure you choose the small batch beef jerky as one of your options). Soup & Share - the pretzels and provolone fondue are a MUST and one order is enough to serve three people. The pork belly nachos are also solid but could definitely use more pork belly. Entrees - the 36 hour pork ribs were good but nothing to write home about. The Korean Style Ribeye Cap is solid with a nice char on the outside and great flavor profile overall. The star was definitely the fried chicken. Crispy and flavorful breading on the outside, tender and moist chicken on the inside (it comes with three pieces). Overall this concept works and provides a very enjoyable drinking and dining experience.",

My turkey pastrami sand on a pretzel roll was equally fantastic...so we're definitely looking to go back, soon!",

So it was hard to find them.    Also  the hamburger we had tasted like a big mac from McDonalds  I guess it was called the mac Burger maybe it was suppose to taste like that.    The pretzels were awesome though.  They came out in pretzels balls  best ever.    Hope they work on the service at the tables.  The bartenders were great!

Even though we didnt order any dessert, they gave us a small thing of monkeybread with ice cream as a birthday treat.. supposedly the person in our group who made the reservation mentioned it.

We,ordered drinks and our meal at the same time cause of the wait.  As we sat we weren't comfortable with the atmosphere, first a train went by blowing the horn every, 10 seconds, which is understandable, but than the music, this was now a club that served food.  We were than disturbed with another other that wasn't ours.  We understand once but twice...  our food came and my burger was good but my wifes meat loaf was buried under ketchup.

The drinks are also very good and creative; you won't see these drinks anywhere else!  There's a few things I dislike about this place. They are ALWAYS crazy busy so if you don't want to wait 50 minutes for a table you should come during \"off hours.\" The music is very loud and I have to yell at my server to place an order, its also hard to have a conversation with anyone. Finally, every time I have come here, it takes a surprisingly long time for any of the hosts at the host stand to acknowledge me. There are 2 hosts there and they will always be talking amongst themselves or staring off pretending to be doing something. Meanwhile, a line of people forms at the stand. I don't know why but it usually takes 5-10 minutes for the host to say hi or \"we will be right with you\" to me, and that bothers me. All in all, I return for the food but I'm not a fan of the atmosphere.",

Made our reservation for Sunday at 5:00 and when we arrived it was pretty full. We were seated right away and our server was great ,very accommodating.  It has a good feel and I think the Ping Pong table and other entertainment look like lots of fun. So we order our food and it comes out in a timely matter but this is where Culinary Dropout missed the mark, the food was lackluster and just so so.  My younger daughter had the fish and chips, my other daughter had the kale salad with salmon and I had the steak tacos, now out of all these (and I tasted everything) you would expect something to be exceptional but the only thing that I would say was really good was the steak taco meat.  It came out to almost 80.00 for the three of us and I left a good tip, but I will definitely not be returning here for the food.  We really wanted to like it but it just wasn't that good.",

    "text": "My sister hosted a baby shower for me at Culinary Dropout (my suggestion based on great feedback from some coworkers) and we were treated so well!  We had a large-ish group of 10 people plus cupcakes and gifts.  I have to honestly say, I have never been treated better at a restaurant with such a large party.  The group ordered everything from the nachos to the grilled cheese sliders to hamburgers.  We also ordered the pretzels and fondue and they brought out an extra order since our meals were taking longer than expected to come out.  The food was absolutely delicious!  I can't wait to come back when not pregnant to enjoy some cocktails with my husband.  The manager guy (I think he was the manager) came over and said some kind words, spoke with my mother in law about the live band that was playing, and made sure I was satisfied before we left.  I cannot speak highly enough of this little hipster haven!",

It's really got something for everyone and I have to assume that it's regularly packed with patrons. If I had a backyard, I'd totally build this bar there.   Our food was decent -- I had a good salad and nibbles off the appetizers but nothing that stands out to me as gastronomical bliss. It's got a solid selection and range though and our servers were pretty prompt. I get where they're going with the fire pits but I think the execution leaves something to be desired.   First, glass near fire seems problematic. Also, the fire pits are like really on fire. So you can't reach across the area to share and it becomes this odd game of pass the plate. Our water glasses were hot to the touch and you can imagine what that meant for anyone with a wine or a cocktail. Their menus are paper... and as it turns out, paper can catch on fire. Ours did not but I see the potential for serious hazard. Not sure how you remedy this architectural snafu but maybe turning the blazing pits down would be a good first start.   It's legit though -- I'd come here for some beers and pretzel bites, a round of cornhole and some flaming fun.",

I really enjoyed our antipasti choice: jamon iberico (for the salty goodness), garlic & herb goat cheese (soft and creamy...probably the best goat cheese I've ever had!), roasted beets & balsamic (perfectly tart and juicy to cut the saltiness of our protein and richness of the cheese), and the truffle potato chips (which was \"ok\" but added some crunch to complete our appetizing mix). As an extra (free) compliment, they surprised us with some sweet candied grapes which worked well with our small charcuterie board. We didn't have any alcohol, but I felt a bit buzzed after completing our meal, probably from all the tyramine, haha! I personally wouldn't eat here on a daily basis, but would recommend as a fun trendy place to hang out with friends on a special occasion.",

I called a week and half in advance and they told me they couldn't reserve the spot that I wanted for my party but I could come at 5 and wait around until 7 so I could save the spot. I declined. I had my boyfriend call back the next day to see if we could reserve a table or tables in the patio area for 12 people. They said yes they could do that. Today the manager called my boyfriend back and told him that they couldn't reserve a table for a large party after 6pm (party at 7). They told him if we wanted a table at 7 we would have to come as 'walk-ins' and take a table that was available (if there was any available for that many people)  Overall I felt very discouraged and unwelcome. What Resturant doesn't take reservations for large parties? Wouldn't a Resturant want to have large guaranteed party to come in to spend money at their place?  I highly doubt I will go back anytime soon which sucks because that place is pretty cool but their policies and staff are not!",

Very easy to find and there a big parking lot and also valet parking available if you don't want to walk through the parking lot.  This place is huge.  Good thing we made a reservation as there were several graduation parties going on so this place was hopping.  I honestly don't remember what we had, but it must have been good, because after flight issues, we decided to come back again the next night for dinner again.  Happy to see they use HF Coors (Arizona made plates and dishes)! and have lots of good options for meals and drinks.  The Fried chicken was great as well as their Kale salad. We had the Pretzel fondue and it was excellent and a very large portion, that a small table of 3 could not come close to finishing, probably since we were not drinking a lot.   There was live music on Thursday evening.  Would recommend this place.",

    "text": "This is definitely somewhere that requires a return visit!   We were quite a large group and were seated out in The Yard - a large covered patio space filled with cosy couches, tons of super hot fire pits, and games. Sadly I didn't get to try the games this time around but hopefully I will next time - I feel like that could have been a highlight!  We sat at a fire pit with a large L-shaped couch on one side, and several adorably mismatched chairs surrounding the other two sides. The fire pit was HOT, seriously hot! Open flame and booze seems like a risky combination to me, but who doesn't love a good backyard fire pit??   It was a little tricky eating our meals off the side of the fire pit, and there was more than one occasion that had me concerned I was going to a. set something on fire, or b. have a melted beer glass from the sheer heat of the flames!  My beer was quite tasty - a good local brew. We shared some tasty devilled eggs, some ok potato chips (a little greasy and under-flavoured for me), and some well done hummus (you can't go wrong with hummus!). For my main I had the grilled cheese sliders; I'm not sure what I was expecting but the flavour wasn't quite there. The three little sandwiches were super cute and filled with well melted cheese slices, bacon and tomato - great for when you're looking for good throwback food to your childhood!  I'm looking forward to my next trip here - I think it has huge potential and I had fun, I just think I could have a lot more fun next time! :)",

    "text": "Culinary Dropout is setup with 3 unique and very cool themes. The first part reminds me of a swanky apartment. There are plenty of tables and would be my pick if you were going out for dinner to enjoy the \"gastro\" part of this gastropub.   The second section is The Yard - a covered patio with plenty of patio couches, fire pits and backyard games. This is where I spent all my time so I'll tell you a bit more about it below!**  I believe the third part is called The Shed, or the Garage or something like that. It's a smaller, very rustic, barn-like building at the far end of The Yard and looks like it could be a whiskey bar or something to that extent. It was closed at the time so I didn't get a chance to check it out.  **I over heard a guy and a girl talking about how much they like corn hole. I looked at them like a cow looks at an oncoming train. You could hear my eyelids blinking in confusion through the silence until another, more savvy Canadian at our table filled in the gaps for me...  \"It's that bean bag game, Dale.\" Suddenly it all makes sense!  The Yard is awesome. It's like a gentrified version of cousin Cletus' famous family BBQ - Fried chicken, pretzels, fire pits and games galore, including (you guessed it) Corn Hole! Maybe I'm taking this a little far. The Yard is by no means redneck. It's relaxed and quite lovely - you could hang out here after work, bring the the kids, go on a date, or yell belligerently about your college football team late at night. I have no doubt that this place must draw quite the party crowd on weekend nights, but you don't need to be that crowd in order to have a good time here.  The food is and upscale version of American comfort classics. Even though I was pretty fooded-out by the time I arrived, I still suckered myself into the fried chicken and I regret nothing. So dang delicious and served with a sweet sauce and a slice of corn bread.",

This place feels as if they transported one of the restaurants there into Tempe.   Well the atmosphere is one thing but the food is among the best dining experiences I've had in a long time.  I had a dish called Korean Cap. It was perfecto.  Perfectly made steak marinated in a Korean sweet spicy sauce. It's hard to describe all of the tastes involved on this dish. You have to experience it for yourself.    We then had a bourbon infused dessert, it was delicious but I bet that if you had the whole pie you would certainly get a DUI.  It's Rich. But it's really good.   Overall it was a great experience. I will certainly be coming back. Service was also great and Victoria was on point with her recommendations.",

They had a live band which was actually really good.   I had the Lumberjack Heff....delicious. My solo mission was to get the ribeye cap, but they were sold out (sad emoji). I didn't have a backup plan but I settled starting with the wings. They were nice and crispy but for me a little too salty. For my dinner went for the meatloaf....I thought it was a little underwhelming. It was filling but I wouldn't say great.  The overall area and solid beer choices I'll be back to give it another shot...but only for a ribeye cap. Ribeye cap or bust!",

The wait staff was very attentive and the menu selection is a great mix of bar food and some others. Didn't get a chance to try any of the meat or cheese plates but will definitely have to next time. We had the Korean style Brussel Sprouts, deviled eggs, chips, honey fried chicken and the ribeye cap. I expected honey on the side for the fried chicken but it was still good and the cap was fantastic. The entrance is not on the street side but on the railroad side and a little confusing so just watch out!",

I'm taking a star off due to my French dip. It looked nowhere as good as the pics I saw on yelp. Meat was dry, barely any cheese....and now they don't serve it with horseradish cream, you have to ask for it. That was the only thing that saved it. For $17, I was really disappointed but Chips and French onion dip were good. I'd give it another shot, maybe it was just a fluke....everyone else seemed to enjoy their food.",

It was for our daughter and it was the turkey sandwich. They were suppose to leave the off the Dijon mustard as well knew my kid wouldn't like it. Her fries were cold too. The services took a while so when the server walked by and we flagged her down to tell her we just didn't want it. They did take it off the bill which we really appreciated. The drinks were all good and the green chili stew was good. However, the egg over top had sat for too long and was no longer runny. Also, we had to ask for 2 of the 7 meals. Our server did the best to make up for it. The Italian salad was really good. I just must be old because it was hard to hear each other and see out on the patio. Again I really wanted to like it and since the food that came warm and correctly was really good. I would still recommend it.",

Unfortunately though I didn't come here to enjoy the staff, I came here for the food which was a little below average. I ordered the pastrami burger. The burger was not that good and I didn't even finish it. It also comes with their house made chips which are actually pretty good, the only problem is that there isn't enough, so if you order a burger get fries because you get way more. I didn't have a bad experience, but I didn't have a great one either. I would try it again though. It is also a fair price.",

Then the waitress shows up, we literally JUST sat down-super rad promptness, but maybe give guests a moment to look at the menu? Then I ordered a drink, after she returned, she asked to see my ID (I left my purse at home). So we found a copy of my Drivers License in our email from recently sending to a realtor. Mind you; I'm 39 years old, with an 18 year old daughter. She asked her manager and he said that he couldn't accept seeing the license and couldn't serve me a drink. I get rules, I do, but I'm obviously over 21.. So! We left. If I'm being honest, I wasn't that impressed with the menu anyways and the \"anti pasta\" menu is cool, but the pricing is a bit much AND I never mind paying for good food.   Needless to say; we won't return. I'm bitter about the carding situation and I sincerely feel the customer service is lacking in experience. This is a disappointment, since we're new to the area and we live and work close to this location.",

For reference, I took my dad here, who is a French-trained professional chef and never has much to say about the restaurants I take him, and he was all about it. Huge kudos to Culinary Dropout for delivering.   The grounds are gigantic, as this location has a Yard attached to it. The nice thing is that this place is always busy but never really feels crowded. Take a seat at one of their expensive-looking couches, chairs, and tables.   From the several times I've eaten here, I've had the fried chicken, ribs, the antipasti plate, gorg chicken salad, Italian chopped salad, and the pastrami. I have never been disappointed or felt like I should've ordered something else. Though I have to say that I am a huge fan of their salads.   Really no need to talk up the bar at all because it has everything that a craft beer lover like myself is into.",

Starting with the positives: -very cool atmosphere for kids and adults with ping pong, shuffleboard and cornhole to play while waiting for your table.  -the best mule I've ever had with homemade ginger agave rather than ginger beer as the base -our server was sweet and kind BUT... Negatives: -our server was clearly stretched too thin. We sat with our food but without silverware for so long my husbands food got really cold and had to be remade. -interestingly he is the only one who ended up with horrible food poisoning later that night. Feels like that means something... -while we sat for at least 10 minutes without silverware we asked 2 different people for it and the first rolled her eyes, said she'd bring some and literally never did!  -some of the food was good but some was so mediocre. My fried chicken was okay but lots of the skin was so over cooked it was inedible it was nearly black in color, dry biscuit with no butter offered and the meatloaf was just ok. Kids fries came out cold.  -and finally, the toilet on the left side of the back bar area I think called the Coop was so disgusting it has clearly not been cleaned in months. It was worse than what my 16 years old's bathroom looks like after I refuse to clean it for months. A nasty film all over the bowl and the bottom base was covered with a nasty combo of pee and dust. I do not know how such a seemingly nice restaurant could allow its bathrooms to be so filthy. It makes me wonder about the cleanliness of the rest of the place and makes me wonder if there is any connection to my husbands awful food poisoning and the cleanliness. All in all, a pretty big disappointment of a visit there which is sad bc there was GREAT potential for it to be an outstanding experience.",

This place might get better the more you visit... which I plan to do again!  My husband and I arrived and were greeted by a friendly hostess who gave us a sitting promptly. They were busy but can accommodate customers inside and out.  The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. I didn't hear any servers apologizing to nearby tables for mistakes and people genuinely appeared to be enjoying their time.  We didn't make it up to the bar or outside. I would like to do so on the next visit though. I'm not sure if the outside games are first come first serve or reserve but we are interested in returning to find out.  Now for the food! I had the BEST honey fried chicken and delicious coleslaw. My husband ordered tacos and they were also scrumptious. We both liked our meals so much that we decided to share half and half. We went here more than a week ago and he's still recommending to others to go try the fried chicken. He says, \"It was the best fried chicken I have ever had!\"  We started our meal with hummus and ended it with a baked apple desert. Everything we had was delicious and every drink was yummy. Our server, Manu, was very attentive and made sure we had whatever we needed. He managed to keep all his tables happy. He really did his best to keep us happy but balanced it well with allowing us privacy.  This visit has us wanting to return for more! As long as they keep that chicken filled with honey, I will definitely return for more.",

The mash potatoes that came with it was great with gravy. The green beans had a slight crisp and were perfect. Hubby said chick was moist but flavoring a little off.

When our party of 11 got here we were told right away we needed to have made a reservation and could only be seated in the outdoor area, which in my opinion is a cute little area if all your going to do is drink which we weren't. We sat outside In hopes we could all get seated together at a real table. 10 minutes into our wait the male host/manager maybe, headed over and led us to 4 small tables apart from each other and seated us. The group of us took the initiative to put our tables together which quite honestly is something they should have done. The waitress Taylor was somewhat rude and seemed bothered by the large group and although the previous waiter had said he would give us separate bills she said she couldn't because it was too much work.  Things to try if you do go here our the wings and artichoke dip the ribs weren't specular but the ambiance was great, just make sure you call first or you could be in for a long wait.",

I had to make myself stop to make sure I could actually eat dinner. I got the grilled chicken sandwich and my wife got the prime rib dip. The food was pretty good, I wouldn't say it was anything to write home about. I did find myself telling my wife several times that it was almost a very hipster place.

The service started out fine, but by the end of the night the bartenders and servers were more concerned with closing down then helping us out even though it was only 9:30 or so.  We had to 25 minutes in between getting our drinks until some random guy walked past and we grabbed his attention to order food. He wasn't our original bartender/server. The pretzels and fondue are the best thing there hands down. Everything else we had was just all right. When our food came the food runners didn't ask if we needed anything else. We had to wander around to other tables to get silverware because we couldn't get any servers attention. I've been there one other time and the antipasto platter is tasty also. The drinks were anything special.   Overall   Atmosphere/location- 5 stars   Food- 3 stars   Drinks- 2 stars   Service- 0 stars",

    "text": "A happy day was soured by a condescending manager, Jason Brown, at the Culinary Dropout. Our event at the Culinary Dropout was coordinated with Alexia Haley, the Event Manager, to celebrate my son's High School graduation.  My initial interest was to have it as a dinner function but was told that the yard area (ping pong, bag toss, etc.) will be for those 21 and older after 6 pm.  So we decided to have the event at 1 pm.  We booked two locations - two lounge seating areas for the high school graduates and a table of 14 in the restaurant for adults.  Shortly after the guests arrived, my son told me that they were not allowed in the ping pong area unless they were accompanied by someone at least 21 years old. I was surprised at his comment but thought the person didn't know that they were 18 year olds and also to relay that the event manager was fine with the 18 year olds and ping pong as long as we were out of the place by 6pm. As soon as I got to the gaming area I was met by an angry man who started yelling at me that the kids can't be in the area unless they were accompanied by a 21-year-old and that he will lose his liquor license.  I proceeded to explain to him that this event had been arranged through Alexia and I was never told to have a 21-year-old present at the ping pong table.  He started yelling \"that he had told Alexia to inform me of the 21-year-old escort rule. And that my teens had to leave if a 21-year-old wasn't present by the table right now.\"  To not disrupt the kids' game, I stayed at the gaming area for a bit but was concerned with the arriving guests. A parent, Anthony, who was watching his younger kids, volunteered to watch my 18 year olds for 5 minutes so I can return to my table to sort out the problem.  I didn't want to create a commotion as I had approximately 30 teenagers arriving and adults at the main dining area. As a courtesy, I informed Jason Brown that I needed five minutes and that the gentlemen (Anthony) standing by the gaming tables will be watching my teens so I can sort out this escort problem.  He spat out \"He cannot watch your kids - Anthony doesn't belong to your party.\"  I replied, \"You told me an adult or a 21-year-old needs to be present and right now he is helping me so I can return to my table to sort out this problem.\"  He shouted \"you are not taking 5 minutes, if you are not back in 2 minutes, your kids will not be playing\".  I later found out he was the District Manager of Culinary Dropout. I am appalled at his condescending conversation towards me. Not only did he not try to help rectify a situation that was a communication problem from his event management staff, but he spoke like a bully. I felt belittled and humiliated. My only conclusion is either he had a bad day or he dislikes Asians. In the service industry, service is key regardless of who you serve.  As a manager, he should try to not make matters worse or intimidate.  He had two other staff standing alongside him guarding the gaming area and as the restaurant wasn't full, he could have helped me if he wanted to. After I sorted my guests and created a rotating shift at the ping pong table, one of my friends asked to speak to the manager. Much to my surprise, Jason Brown showed up.  I don't know what the nature of their discussion was but at the end, he gifted two of the wines we ordered - a gesture we very much appreciated.  All the staff at Culinary Dropout were courteous and Alexia Haley was a joy to work with. All the guests were happy at the end of the day but Jason's conversation with me at the gaming area makes me want to speak up for all the minorities that gets picked on based on a preconceived notion of a particular minority feature...  this is especially important for managers or District Managers. Tempe is a diverse college city with lots of Internationals and I hope everyone gets the respect they deserve as a citizen of the world no matter their race, religion, gender or sexual orientation. Would have been 4 stars if not for the intimidating encounter with Jason Brown.  I frequent this place and have recommended it to many friends.  So sad.",

In any case, we ended up having a few more people, for which they gladly accommodated us, and still had a great time. Food is always good, and I'm a sucker for the pretzel bites w/cheese dip!

I definitely recommend the soft pretzel and provolone fondue to start. I got the two soft words cocktail and  fried chicken upon the waitress's recommendation. The drink was fruity as expected and the fried chicken was good, but did not live up to the hype the waitress gave. The monkey bread is really delicious and a perfect way to end the meal.   The yard is pretty loud and hard to have a conversation there, so I recommend a table inside if you are planning to chat.   Overall it is a good place to go on the weekend to have some food and drinks and hang out in the yard. The food was pretty good, but pretty pricey for what you get, especially the drinks. The bill adds up quickly here, so beware.",

Son has nut(s)/sesame seed  allergy so opted burger on pretzel bun. It came out with a few sesame seeds on it so just cut up the meat and tossed the bun.  Compared to the Phoenix location (full of families)this one needs work! If you have food allergies beware as I don't think staff is trained to handle (and should be).  Update 12/28-I was contacted by the general manager about our experience which is truly appreciated.  They want us to come back, and enjoy the experience (as I did at the Phoenix location), while feeling assured of food allergies awareness there.  We will give it another try and update after.",

The thai chicken wings were spicy and full of flavor.  The Kale and corn salad, a heaping side of greens and goodies.  Perfect dinner salad.  We also ordered the Ramen.  The broth was savory with the perfectly cooked runny egg split open.  Noodles cooked nicely as well but the lack luster zucchini was pretty boring.  Still a great dish though but I wish I would've chose the fried chicken.  The atmosphere-  Large space with tall ceilings and a large patio.  Frat house-Bro bar mixed with upscale Hampton-ish hipsters with a side of beautiful people.   Strange.",

I get it, it's late at night and it's seat yourself, but just would have liked a little more attentiveness from the staff. We had to ask for menus, and sat at our table for some time before our server came over.  Didn't eat much of the food, but the menu seemed like your typical bar food selection with a few twist. I ordered the monkey bread dessert, that was it. I would definitely say stop by here if you're in the AZ area. A different take on night life.

As far as price goes, this place is not amongst the cheapest, but I would say it's worth the money.

So why are restaurant hamburgers so difficult to deliver in an eatable state? Look ate the fried chicken plate. Pick up a piece of chicken and enjoy. As well as mashed potatoes and gravy. Simple. Will this restaurant ever surprise anyone who eats a hamburger with that same simplicity? I truly doubt they will ever try. Nothing special about a hamburger here in fact typical of any chain. I'll keep looking.",

The iced tea was also quite good.",

They have corn hole and ping pong tables to play with your party before or after your meal. As well as live music- which is both a pro and a con for me. Pro: he sings acoustic covers and is actually good at it. Con: the music is always way too loud.   Recommend: pretzels and fondue, bbq pork belly nachos, fried chicken.   Tip: it's been a year since I've gone, but if it still holds True- happy hour all day long for Sunday football.",

I've eaten here a couple of times and I've tried something different each time hoping I'd get the food experience I was hoping for, however I just haven't had it yet. I want to love this place more than I do but what can you do. It does tend to take wait staff a little longer than I'd like to get you refills or check on you, not sure why this is even when it's not overly busy. I wonder if it's just because it's a more laid back environment. It's a great place to get drinks and hangout, don't expect too much more.",

We went during lunch and after college graduations so it was kind of busy. Nevertheless, service was great, friendly staff who were very attentive, and a great atmosphere. They have a stage in the corner for live music. I'd definitely go back and see what that's like.   We had pork belly nachos and a pub burger. Homemade chips and pulled pork were great. All the cheese settled on the bottom chips and we all know what cheese is like once it's cold...no bueno! The burger was good. I asked for medium well and it came out a little under cooked for my liking. They made me a new one! They surely have my vote.",

Great place to enjoy yourself and watch the game. The food is so hit or miss. The chicken wings are to die for. Do NOT get the pretzels and fondue, whoever says to get them is an idiot. First off the pretzels are kind of firm, like scones. Then the cheese isnt even melted, its kind of similar to velveeta cheese. So thats trash so dont get that. The salads look bomb, i highly recommened this place",

There are many areas for friends to gather and just catch up. It's a perfect location for larger parties too! The staff is abundant and we were extremely lucky to have Joel as our waiter extraordinaire! He guided us through the eclectic menu and we were not disappointed with our choices of BBQ Pork belly nachos, chicken Gorgonzola salad, kale salad and chopped salad! The nachos are a must and ample portion to share! When it was time to go Joel packages up my husbands leftover chopped salad and we noticed he wrote on container what was inside and the date. My husband was really impressed with such a simple detail that I'm the past would save us from headache of looking through your leftover containers to find \"your\" food. We complimented him on this detail and he said he does it because its important to know what's in container and when it was made! We'll definitely be back to Culinary Dropout and hope we can get Joel as our waiter!",

    "text": "This is new since our last time in Tempe and we liked it enough the first time to come back (yes we ordered different food!) again within two days. The venue itself is large with a big indoor space as well as an outdoor space. It's Tempe and it's August...we chose to sit inside. Happy hour prices for both drinks and food are good and they have a dollar beer-in-a-bag. We liked our food a bit better the first day when we selected soft preztels with a cheese fondue dip. Those were delicious, but rich, and we couldn't quite finish between the two of us, though we did take the leftover pretzels home. Out other split was a kale salad that had corn and all kinds of other good stuff in it and that was completed with a light and flavorful dressing. On the second trip we had a pimento cheese appetizer and potato chips. Both were good; we needed bread for the cheese, but were able to get by with the potato chips. One person in our party got a chicken sandwich. It was good, but there were a couple of bones or pieces of fat/cartilage in the chicken that were a bit unsavory (our guest was polite and didn't explain). We ordered the grilled cheese sliders the second day. They are rich and good and just a bit too much for how I've been eating lately. Rather than ordering a plate for myself, I'd be more inclined to split an order and a salad.... All in all, the food is good, the ambiance is great, the service is above average for sure, and the portion sizes are generous for the price. Came back twice in a couple of days...I'm sure I'll return again in the future.....",

There is a lot of parking and there is even complimentary valet... We went on a Tuesday evening and were able to get a table upon walking in... The hostess was extremely nice and friendly... She asked us if we had been to the/a Culinary Dropout and we said they we had been to the one in Scottsdale... Our server Chris was very attentive and great with recommendations... The Fried Chicken was really good and it didn't take as long as I thought it would... It also came with mashed potatoes and a veggie that I can't remember, but it was super filling and yummy... I had a moscow mule and although the pricing was a little steep for a small \"clear\" glass, it was made to perfection... I agree with other people and I think that $10 for a pretty small, \"not copper\" glass is a bit much, so hopefully something changes there, but I did enjoy the drink and can't wait to try the other mixes. As full as I was at the end of my meal, I wanted to try one of the desserts (they all sound amazing) and so we went with the Bourbon Black Bottom Pie. The pie was super good and completed the entire meal, I had to roll out of the joint... On our way out, we walked through the \"play area\" where there is cornhole and ping pong... I like the couch areas with the little fire places, great for \"cold\" nights... I can't wait for the summer to roll around because you know that area will be crazy busy, but crazy fun... Oh and there is an outside-ish bar on the North side which has Happy Hour, all the time...",

Everyone I know raves about how they could drink the cheese because it is just that delicious.  Other items on the menu that I would recommend are the pub burger and the sweet corn cannelloni. The one thing I would not recommend is the ramen - it was pretty bland, didn't have shrimp as advertised, and when I asked for Sriracha to jazz it up, I never received any. That was probably more of a miss on my server's part though.  There is tons of space for activities, so it is GREAT for large groups. But heads up: if you go to the back area near where the games are you can only order from a limited food menu.",

Also tried the pretzel fondue. I've never had such a delicious bowl of soft, warm, pretzely goodness. And then add melted cheese. Heaven.  Some interesting signature drinks. Extensive beer menu with several AZ brews.  Live music on Fridays and Saturdays, although not sure how that works with the game on?

Out server was nice, but he was way too \"attentive\", this was our first time there and while having a server explain the menu is what most people prefer, my friend and I just want to be given time to read it ourselves. He kept stopping by which made it harder to concentrate and it became somewhat annoying. Maybe he was new or we were his last table and he wanted to get our order in quickly. Once we ordered he pretty much left us alone and we enjoyed our time there.  We shared the grilled cheese sliders and the seared tuna salad. The sliders look more impressive than they taste and we only ate one each. The salad was something else! It is probably one of the most delicious salads I have ever had. Just typing this makes me want to drive down there and have one for dinner. Definitely give this place a try!",

There were 4 adults in our party and we were celebrating our adult daughters' birthday. First of all, the restaurant is hard to find - many one way streets and construction. When you enter you go down a long hall to the actual restaurant. The restaurant itself is similar to a large convention hall with poor acoustics. It was very, very loud - making it difficult, at times impossible, to have a normal conversation. Our server was really lacking in just about every trait a server should have, including the 4 rings in her exposed belly button - not very appetizing. From the moment we arrived we felt very rushed by her. Our meals were pretty good. I had the sweet corn cannelloni, which was an unusual dish and very sweet, my husband had the Italian Grinder - something he always orders at CD, our son had the fried chicken which he said was very good and our daughter had the grilled cheese sliders, which she thought were OK. We had ordered a bowl of the \"daily house made chips\", which were stale. Despite our opening gifts, cards, etc., the server never acknowledged our celebration.   Quite frankly, I am sorry we chose this restaurant for our daughter's birthday. It was a disappointing evening. I expect more from a Fox Concepts restaurant.",

Unfortunately, this was the first visit for 3 of my family members and it may mean they never return to a Culinary Dropout.  It took 15 minutes for drink refills (water included in that).  We had their famous pretzel and cheese appetizer.  That was delicious.  My brother had a burger and found that it was good.  My sister in law had the chicken salad and said it was way overdressed.  My mother had the nachos app and disliked the thick greasy chips.  I had the ramen soup and it was so salty I could't eat the broth and barely any of the soup.  gross!  Given that it took 15 min for drink refills I couldn't choke down the soup.    They never came by to check on the food so none of it was sent back, we never saw the manager but at the beginning when he came to change a chair out telling us we couldn't use that one even though the hostess had put it there.  Needless to say, we will not be returning to this location.",

When a group of 11 of us went there last week, we were not impressed. The service was terrible.  It took 25 minutes for the waiter to come around and take our orders. After taking our order, the food took about 40 minutes to come out. Unfortunately, they forgot to place one of our orders. It took another 40 minutes for our friend to get his food.  As for the food, it was terrible, at least for me it was. I had the beer batter fish and chips and I felt like I was eating  cardboard. It was flavorless and tasted like it was fried in old, overused oil. However, my husband had a burger and he loved, but seriously, can you really go wrong with a burger?   This place is just not amusing.",

He made sure everything was perfect from the beginning of our meal until the end. We also had spectacular service from our energetic server Alex. We stayed to play ping pong and all of the other games offered. We had so much fun we even stayed to watch the band that played great music that night. We had such an awesome night!

My Pub Burger with fries, complimented was a side of freshly chopped jalapenos was delicious! And to finish our dining pleasure, we wrapped it up with fresh-baked Monkey Bread for dessert. Double tasty! Also, our ASU server, Shawn, was very friendly, attentive and engaging, adding to the experience. Love it! The Culinary Dropout building was originally a retail lighting store for over fifty years and the current application of subdued lighting reflects that history, as well as creating a relaxing, casual environment. Visit... you won't be disappointed!",

But when the food is this good, you can't stop yourself!!  The house potato chips with onion dip....OMG, get in my belly! So flavorful and crispy! Then, let's have a little chat about the soft pretzels and provolone fondue...I may or may not have eaten almost an entire basket by myself!!  Ok, and then here's my major confession: I am a veggie-saur, but pregnancy cravings have me devouring a juicy burger from time to time and this my friends was one of those times. The pub burger was incredible! Juicy and bursting with flavor! I could only fit half of it in my stomach after the little incident with the house chips and pretzel bites.  The service was amazing and the decor is gorgeous! They will even give you a tour of the restaurant at any time during your meal. What a great place to hang with friends, co-workers or your special someone.   The house potato chips, did I mention those yet?? Get them!!",

It's gotta be tough to carve out a niche amongst the tough restaurant competition in Tempe, but CD has done it, and done it well.  They have a good menu of sandwiches and Entrees available, including burgers, cold cuts, hot sandwiches, and vegetarian options. You can find down-home staples right next to globally-inspired experiments, and it's all delicious.   One of their staples is the meatloaf, which is great. Thick, crusty,  Its Tomato topped with a thick slab of griddled meatloaf, beans, and  sauce. It's a mouthful, and it's great. Not for the faint of heart .  Service from the minute I walked in were on it , from Chris who sat me to Victoria my waitress who was very professional and atentive going as the extra step and bringing me a great cup of coffee  .

The service did not live up to it. Staff dressed in casual jeans, whatever shirt they wanted and converse in all colors. I'm not necessarily opposed to it, but it made it impossible to determine who was staff. Waiter sat at our table to ask about drinks, food, etc. - awkward. The meeting spaces looked nice. The weather was nice enough to sit outside with space heaters and misters that spray everywhere. That seemed like a design flaw. Huge wrap around couches which were actually plastic.",

It is in a building called the Yard in the Farmers Art District. (If you have never been to the Tempe downtown Mill Ave area about a block away it should be on your bucket list.)  We had a server named Alex who was exemplary.  A server can make or break your experience at a restaurant.  If you have a good one with great food, like we did, you'll tell a friend.  If you have a bad experience you'll tell ten friends.  Since he could tell that it was our first visit, he took time to go through the menu and give tips.  Also, when we placed our orders he asked if certain ingredients would be ok.  Two thumbs up.  When our wines were served, the person serving asked if we wanted to sample them first.  Another two thumbs up.  I wish that I had a dollar for places where the wine was terrible yet there was no such sample first procedure.  We had the garlic hummus & pita bread. (excellent)  The grilled chicken club was good but was heavy with the smoked ham and bacon.  Good, but I'd not order it again.    Although we did not see live entertainment, they do offer it on several nights during the week.  With concrete floors you can tell it will be loud so be aware.  There was a sign for tailgate events prior to ASU football games.  It would probably be great but you might want to get a bike cab for the few blocks to the stadium.  Based on our experience we'll definitely return and try different dishes.",

Service was attentive, also a good thing considering how slow it was (sometimes servers slack off when it's slow).  It was pretty empty so got the pick of seats, asked for shade outside, but the hostess tried to sit us in 1/2 sun. She was nice enough after asking again to move us to full shade.  Egg white fritatta was good! It was served with Kale but that was kind of tough; doesn't look like they massaged it well enough to soften it up.  Family had eggs & bacon, and biscuits & gravy. Expect french-style bread- quite crusty so unless your mouth is used to it, it can hurt your upper palate. However, it was toasted on the grill and buttered nicely.  Biscuits & Gravy was good, but oddly had American cheese on it. I was put off, but my brother liked it.  Irish coffee wasn't really. Not sure if this was the SAT AM bartender, or not. It was just Jameson and coffee, no cream, no sugar.",

I can't remember her name but she was a blond with shoulder length hair and a good head on her shoulders. I will edit when I figure out her name. The food was enjoyed by all. Recommend the starter nachos and the pretzels. The meatloaf looked delicious and the burgers were a big hit. Ravioli was good but not enough to fill you up. Tuna tartare was a disappointment and got sent back. I was also a little put back by the fact when I sent it back it was politely pointed out that not everyone like raw tuna. I love raw tuna...  this was very salty and in the light appeared to be half cooked. Wish they would have just put raw filets on my plate and it would have been a 5 star review. Ambiance is loud but still very capable of having conversations with your table. It is fun and upbeat with some very creative drink ideas.",

I've been to the different locations over the years and loved the food and everything was great.     This time was a lot different the food wasn't bad the drinks were good no complaints there. I know it's a different world and people dress differently,  but I couldn't believe how they dressed at the Tempe location. It honestly made me feel uncomfortable I pretty much just kept my head down. Our waitress had a white tank top on with no bra headlights showing like crazy.   If I was single or not with my two girls I probably wouldn't have cared.   You could see everything she might as well have just had no shirt on at all. Every girl working there was dressed very similar. Even though I like the food and the drinks and the building is great I will never go back.    I'm just not sure how this company is OK with the waitresses wearing no bras under tight tank tops and white tank tops. One of the waitresses skirts was so short that she would pull it down every few seconds. Using speak to text so I apologize about the grammar. But if you're a family man this is not the place for you if you're a single guy and love staring at beautiful girls with no clothes on then this is definitely your place.   After saying this  it probably is actually a really good idea to do this in Tempe right next to the college.  So I get it but Dam this was crazy .",

We shared two different meals to get a feel for them, vegan curry is alright, has a beautiful taste but probably wouldn't order again because there are other things. The nachos were absolutely to die for! So filling, and so so much so be aware of the portion sizes. We couldn't even finish all of our food. Staff is also very friendly and considerate!  Be aware that there are two entrances and one of them has a pretty far way to walk (for those with difficulties) so be sure to park on CD's main entrance near the kitchen.",

The indoor seating has nice open tables and bar you can sit at their full bar with spirits, cocktails and numerous beers on tap with TVs galore. Outdoors it's a cool, laid back atmosphere and is literally cool with water misters and covering from the sun. There are lots of games for adults such as pool, shuffle board, horseshoes, corn hole and foos ball! The kids ate their chicken tenders, my man and I ate the cheese burger, so good!! I had a couple of their cocktails, especially their copperless mule, so good!! If you are in Tempe you n Ed to eat at Culinary Dropout!",

The following are the reasons for one star:  1) HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! we got a party of 7 on a Thursday evening. When we got there, the hostess wasn't specific and pointed at a table. We sat down, the manager asked us to move because we didn't make a reservation. We moved to the skinny tables for 7 of us next to the bar and shared it with another unknown customer. The table we originally sat down was vacant all evening. They also had 2 more without no one there. Why you pretend your restaurant is busy when it's not??? Mind blowing.  2) my chicken sandwich was awful. The meat is dry and tasteless. My salad had no dressing, I had to ask for it.  3) Overpriced, overpriced and overpriced!!!  4) our server has NO personally. He did not seem to want to be there nor to serve us. No smile. He handed us the flatware with bare hands on my fork. He served other people, cleaned and touched money...who knows what his dirty hands had touched, then handed down the flatware.   5) the music was so loud that we screamed over one another.  6) the place is hot as hell.  I will never return to this place. Not my cup of tea!",

For lunch had the tasty turkey pastrami on a pretzel roll with swiss and coleslaw. Touted by some as a signature dish, not quite sure why it was called turkey  \"pastrami.\" The sandwich came with french fries. Those were unremarkable, no crunch to it.    I think we had a good sampling  of the more popular appetizers. Overall it was more than an ok experience, different food choices were good. Left in a food coma...I don't think that was heat stress.

I had just moved to Arizona so I had a temporary paper license and my old license with a little hole in it (that's what they do at the DMV). When I presented my old  license, the security guard was very stern and would not accept it and told me to come back with the paper version of it which I left in my car a mile away. (Even tho I'm way past 21). I get it, it's a college town, there are liability issues, but the guy was so unfriendly, I left on the first occasion, not wanting to do a 2 mile trek to return.  I came back for lunch to give it another shot for football Sunday. My friend and I ordered a cheese fondue which I found to be rather mediocre. The cheese resting in a mini cauldron sits on top of a little candle. The cheese hardened within minutes. However, the salads are decent as well as the monkey bread. There are also a multitude of TVs so you can catch whatever team you're rooting for. Great spot to watch sports.   The outside leads to The Yard so you can play all sorts of games like corn hole, ping pong, take pics at the photo booth, or just hang out.",

    "text": "Giving Culinary Dropout in Tempe 1 star for various reasons. We had reserved a table for 13 for a graduation dinner and were seated at the first table inside the door (no problem so far). Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, but it didn't take long for things to go downhill. For different reasons, a few of us got up and walked outside throughout our 2 1/2 hours at the restaurant (picture taking, etc.). For unknown reasons, security had an issue with that AND with us. The people in our group ranged in age from 20 to 65, and I only mention that because more than half of our group was over the age of 40, and NONE of us were being loud, obnoxious,or drunk. First of all, the service was extremely slow, hence the 2 1/2 hours, and several of our appetizers and entrees contained toast or bread, which was so burnt you couldn't chew it or even cut it with a knife. Right before we left, the waiter came over and said that we were \"cut off\". Thinking it had to be a joke, we asked both the waiter and bartender what we had done wrong and they both said that they didn't make that call, it was security. We then left in 4 separate groups, the last 2 standing beside their car waiting for a Lyft since they had a couple of drinks. At that time, they were in plain sight of security and as they were driving off, were flipped off by one of the security guys. Early the next morning when they went to get their car, they discovered it had thousands of dollars worth of damages from vandalism (it's a classic vehicle and several parts are irreplaceable) and the car had to be towed. We are about 99% sure it was security, but interestingly enough, there are no cameras on that side of the building. Will never go back there and the whole graduation experience was ruined for us. They actually deserve zero stars.",

Noise level was good for friends and laugh, not suitable for a first date. There are lots of fun entertainment games as well you can play before or after your meal.

    "text": "Had the pleasure of coming to this venue for a company anniversary party over the weekend. We were in a private room and was set away from the crowds of the Halloween weekend. I remember peeking through when this was a blank space, but it was set up nicely for the company function. The night started off with a little happy hour. It was great that there was a private bar within this space and there were 2 bartenders taking care of the party. There was probably 150-175 attendees and the bartenders were on top of their game. Throughout the night, I didn't have to wait long to refresh my drink. When we sat down at our tables, there was a short speech about how far the company has come. I sat at one of the very last tables and although they had speakers set up throughout the floor, it was hard to hear. I'm not sure if it was the speakers or the space of the room? Anyways, our dinner was set up buffet style. There was one long table set up with all the food options and we were able to get through from both sides. My dinner plate consisted of the chopped salad (so yummy that I went up for an extra plate after I finished my dinner), kale salad, 36 hour pork ribs (pretty tender), fried chicken (crispy with a little sweetness), mashed potatoes & gravy (salty), green beans and pumpkin cheesecake (I don't like cheesecake much but I ate the whole piece). For a buffet, I thought dinner was pretty good. Food was plentiful and even after everyone went through the line, the food items were re-filled. We finished the night outside in the private courtyard and played a game of cornhole. This was a nice venue for a smaller, intimate group with great amenities!",

Their Soft Pretzel with Provolone Fondue was absolutely AMAZING!!!!  I have a hard time just eating one.    I absolutely love their House Smoked Salmon and their Beer Battered Fish & Chips were wonderful!  Hubby had their Meatloaf.  Of course, I had to try it out too.

The pretzel bites tasted like egg nuggets and the cheese fondue was bland. The hummus was decent but we didn't finish any of it. The wings we ordered tasted like the sauce came out of a pre-made bag and were beyond sweet.  We have years of experience in the restaurant industry and this was a waste of our money. The atmosphere is nice for ADULTS to hang out and play yard games with a drink in a cozy space. I do not recommend this as a family friendly spot. I give them 2 stars for that and that only.",

Apparently, there was another party from my company as well.  We were seated, drinks and appetizers were order AND on the table. It the middle of our conversation, we were informed by the manager, Alyssa Pope, that there was a mix-up in the reservation and we needed to move! Coming from a family that has been in the restaurant business for over 40 years, a lifetime in customer service and possessing plain old common sense and courtesy...this is not what you do! You apologize to your unseated party for YOUR error, seat and accommodate them immediately. I am wondering what Alyssa expected us to do with our drinks and appetizers as we stood there dumbfounded shuffling about, while they cleared our table, commenting under their breath, to replace us with the unseated party. I must mention that my group was made up of entirely black colleagues and the party we were unseated for was white. This was my second time visiting and I remember thinking then, that I would not be back.  It wasn't the most warm and welcoming environment and the food was mediocre at best. We decided to give them another chance as it was close to work. Never again!",

Well that chance proved for a third and final time that I won't be visiting here much.  First time I went there I had a waiter who ignored my table almost the entire night. I had the turkey pastrami sandwich (which is normally a big hit) and found the flavors to be all wrong. I couldn't eat any of it.   Second time around my table ordered the antipasti meat and cheese board, which was delicious. The heirloom tomatoes were my favorite. I had the bourbon pie to end the night and that was also a big hit with me. But again, the service was awful and we were ignored most of the evening.  Upon my recent trip there, the restaurant took out everything I loved. The bourbon pie, the heirloom tomatoes, this certain kind of amazing cheese...they've all been taken off the menu. Those were the only reasons I came back. Now they're gone.   Oh well, I had already sat down. Might as well try the new menu item, cheddar and potato pierogies, right? Wrong. For $10, you only get 3 tiny pierogies. Are you kidding me?? It's also under the \"shareable\" items. How in the world do you split three tiny dumplings with any kind of group? It's ridiculous and a ripoff.   It was such a disappointment and now there's no reason for me to return to this place in the future.",

Then had to wait 40 min for food to come out! Our waitress totally forgot about us! She never can back to refill drinks and we had to flag down another server to get refills.  The food was ok. I got the hummus appetizer and it was good. Just not very much for 12 $$ price.  My husband got the broccoli cheddar cannelloni. The cannelloni itself was very good! But it came with 3 big pieces of broccoli on top that were burnt to a crisp! They literally were disintegrating. We asked waiter if that's how they were supposed to be and he said they were supposed to be \"charred\". They were in no way edible. Our friends got the same dish and there's was exactally the same.  After this experience we will most likely not be going back! At least not to this location. Nothing is worse than bad service and burnt food!",

It would seem that they knew right away that we were knew to the place and the owner came out to introduce herself and the point of the restaurant.   We decided to get happy hour appetizers because we didn't realize how expensive this place can get and we had already eaten before we came to this restaurant. I got the nachos and my friend got the cheese fondue with pretzel and greatly under estimated the amount that would come out.  The nachos were really good, the pork brisket was tender and full of flavor and the cheese wasn't overpowering and gag-worthy. I'm not a fan of cheese but the nachos were really and I would definitely come back just for the nachos.   The only reason why I am giving this 4 stars, is because the cheese fondue was pretty plain for the price it was selling for. The pretzel was good for being made from scratch but I wasn't impressed as I was with my nachos. But I could be biased because I'm not a fan of pretzel and cheese anyway..   Overall we paid about 13-14 dollars for both plates and there was so much leftovers to bring home    I would most definitely come back here to try their drinks and other food. Everything sounded so good. If it wasn't the fact that I am a lightweight and it was during the daytime I most likely would have tried their drinks no doubt.",

    "text": "My wife and I happen to be in Tempe and without kids. Since the Cosmos aligned, thought we would try a place that doesn't have a slide or play place attached to it.. Culinary Dropout sort of hard to find yet well worth the hunt!   After walking down a long, cement hallway, it opens up to an airy, hipster yet welcoming main area.  We were quickly seated and quickly attended to.  The food consisted of a variety of burgers etc with some culinary twists. We shared the roast beef dip and also had the pretzel bites to go. Fantastic meal and the bites w/the cheese sauce are dangerously good. Good craft beer selection of local favorites along with some non-local goodies.  The server did give me the wrong beer yet I did not complain...it's beer! All in all, great place to dine and if the Cosmos aligns again (or we get a sitter), we will head to Culinary Dropout!!",

The antipasti is a la carte, so you decide what's on that delicious cheese plate.  The only critique is that it is a very open space, so it's relatively loud in there. Perfect for a socialite like myself, but I probably won't take my dad there.",

I had Jameson on the rocks and it was over $11 which sucked, but the place was so cool it made the prices worth it. I started out with the pretzels and cheese. OMG. Forgive my basic white girl terminology but that stuff is freaking amazing. I mean, last meal on Earth would definitely include those pretzels. I think they were $13, but it comes with plenty of pretzels and plenty of sauce and if you're looking for a foodgasm you get that too. I mean, I would be cool just eating that for dinner. But I was chillin watching sports so I ended up staying a while and god hungry again. Went for the Korean BBQ flavored ribeye. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT FOODGASM. I swear to god that was the best piece of steak I've had in my life. So much flavor. Perfectly prepared. Paired with the most delicious vegetables. I've eaten at a lot of bougie (sp?) places with ridiculously priced menus and gotten Kobe beef or filet mignon. I'd pick this piece of steak over any of that any day. Best $26 I've spent on food in a very long time. Ball out and get it. YOLO.",

    "text": "It just goes to show that you don't need a formal culinary education to cook beautifully. Culinary Dropout hits all the right notes with its delicious food. Take great ingredients, interesting compositions, and beautiful presentation and you have CDO.   The place can be quite boisterous as it gets later on in the day. Sit at the bar if you're dining alone and have a few beers or some wine. There's local Arizona beer as well as canned beers in paper bags.   Don't miss the charcuterie. It's only $5 for a healthy one-ounce serving of any of these meats. It's sliced paper thin, almost transparent, leaving the flavor no space to hide. Prosciutto is classic. A supplement of $8 is what it'll cost you for the Jamon Iberico, a truly special kind of meat that comes from special, acorn-fed Spanish black Iberian hogs that will leave you hungry for more. Rarely do I see it offered at restaurants but when I do, I always order it. You should too, as their slicing technique is perfect and the meat is perfectly salty and flavorful.  I also ordered the special (very limited) Korean style ribeye-cap. Ribeye cap is the fattier end piece of ribeye that is normally discarded after grilling or broiling a whole ribeye steak, but the kitchen does wonders with it, recognizing with a keen eye that we should not treat it as a second-class cut of meat. Instead, they marinate it in soy, ginger, garlic, spicy Korean paste (gochujang), and other aromatics, grill it until nicely charred on the outside and medium rare on the inside, and serve it dressed with sliced zucchini, bean sprouts, beech mushrooms, onions, cilantro, raw garlic, and more of the soy dressing. The raw garlic is amazing, providing a zip and delivering a respectful nod towards authentic Korean BBQ.  \"Yesterday's soup\" also caught my eye -- the name on the menu is meant to do that. The name will definitely solicit questions; maybe they should change it. But I enjoyed a bowl of chicken noodle, rich with flavor, as if my grandmother had been simmering a pot of chicken bones for hours. My only complaint is that the white meat in the soup was dry and flavorless. In the future, maybe the kitchen will learn that tender chicken meat in soup is welcome (either dark meat or white meat that's just perfectly cooked).  In any case, the service is wonderful, the space is lively and noisy, and the food is amazing. I'm looking forward to visiting again and seeing what a culinary dropout can do.",

The wait staff was attentive and demonstrated a real team effort.  We started with a Tempe craft beer and crusty bread.  I opted for their signature fried chicken (I waited for it as the menu stated) but was disappointed :-( which was the only reason for 4 out of 5.  The outside was far to crispy to bite into and had to be peeled away to salvage the chicken.  Pretty over cooked I guess.  The wife had the meat loaf which was more than awesome.  The mashed potatoes were very creamy and tasty.    The menu is short but with a wide variety of selections.    Atmosphere was a younger generation, so it felt good to me celebrating my 65th birthday.  Lots of activity in the game area, fun family style digs.  Convenient with plenty of lot parking (valet available) and street parking if you're early.  We'll drive the 40 minutes again just to experience the fun.",

The first time was almost a year ago and we had a similar experience but not so important that I felt the need to say anything.  After all it get's great reviews and mine may not really make a difference.  The similarities in the two visits were that it took a long time to get our food.  Today it was almost an hour. We started to ask the waiters assistant at about 40 mins how much longer it would be. Then the waiter came over and apologized as the kitchen was backed up.  Later, the manager came over to apologize but made no attempt to make any amends.  Then we got the food which was delivered cool to lukewarm in temperature (which made some feel it had been waiting awhile before it was delivered)  Again, talked to the waiter who then I assume made some appeal to the manager on our behalf, but I don't know for sure.  He did offer us a complementary desert but we declined. I don't anticipate going back again.  Plenty of really great restaurants with great food and atmosphere who have a better handle on customer service.  I really want to like this place more. I hope your experience is not ours.",

So keeping this in mind, last time I decided to *splurge* and  ordered TWO prairie breeze cheddars (which totals to $8 for JUST CHEESE). Lol what came in my to-go box was literally two TINY broken up pieces of cheese that did not even amount to how much someone gets for ONE order of cheese. I'm very disappointed that I was fine with paying extra for another cheese, but you guys still jipped me. I might as well have gotten only one Cheese, I wonder what you would have put in there if I did. One tiny little crumb of cheese for $4 perhaps? Not ordering from your location ever again.",

I only had a couple, but could have indulged with more :) You could easily make a meal out of just the appetizers!  I also ordered a burger. It was tasty, but nothing too special. I wish I had gotten more apps, as those were incredible!  It's kind of pricey. Still, a good place with a fun atmosphere!",

I loved all the tactile elements, but the food and drinks also delivered at high marks.    Great drink selection for all, and a nice menu of unique takes on standard food retail staples.  Get a reservation if you can, but have a drink and enjoy the atmosphere if you have to wait.  The place is huge but very popular right now.    Highly recommended.",

We stopped in for an early dinner, had the rainbow trout and the steak and potatoes. The fish was bland, usually covered in a caramelized sauce, almonds and really tasty, I was actually craving it, that's why we went. It was cooked well, just lacking the caramelized sauce, which unfortunately made the dish a little bland. I was really looking forward to it too :( Now on the other hand, the steak and potatoes were delicious! Cooked really well, seasoned deliciously and made my taste buds dance! I think next time Ill have a plate of that myself or try something else on the menu. A little pricey for hit and miss food.",

    "text": "Well, the name is apt, that's for damn sure. I can clearly see how and why he/she/they dropped out.  The \"culinary\" isn't all that bad, albeit over-seasoned. But, it's like a sports bar that met a country farm wedding in a barn.  The service is just not good. I sat, invisible, at the bar for a good 10 minutes at 6 (not busy). Then, when I finally got someone's attention to order a couple of bites, I was asked to \"check the box\".  Really?!?!  I hate that (and the stupid waste of paper). If you don't have sense enough to remember 2 items (or be able to send them to the kitchen for production on anything other than a grocery list), give it up!  I made a couple of scratches on the sheet and was pleasantly surprised by the taste.  I'm still confused why the \"bites\" would all arrive on one dinner plate ... Poorly arranged (as opposed to separate small tapas-style plates). And that cheese chunk (with no bread) was laying right there along with all the rest: ODD. Plus, the Brussels sprouts were as cold as a stone. I don't get that either. The thyme with beets and balsamic was a treat (can't wait to try that at home).  But, one beet bite was overlooked and the next was raw. Too bad.   Service never got any better, unfortunately ... Received the wrong items  after scratching them on my grocery list and had to practically strangle one of those bartenders for another cocktail (actually a glass of wine). Too bad.    Finally, stop asking for my damn name. I was asked 7 times in an hour and 15 mins by at least 4 different people. If you can't serve 10 people at the bar on a Wed night with five people back behind the bar, then yes ... Please: DROP OUT and GIVE IT UP!",

The service is usually pretty superior too.   I came for lunch the other day and I think we were the first to arrive. The chopped salad that I ordered was delicious, it had salami, provolone, turkey pastrami, ham, pickled vegetables and large couscous. It was so big I couldn't finish it.   The only drawbacks are the prices which are a tad steep, and that they don't have any wine specials during happy hour. Either way I know I will be back, this is a great addition to Tempe and I am sure the college kids will have a blast playing games if they can afford the beer.",

    "text": "Every now and again there's a restaurant I'll visit which feels like they deserve way more than 5 stars, this is one of them let me explain why. First off I chose this place for it's vibe, food and great reviews which I'd seen on Yelp. A lot of people mentioned Happy hour so we definitely wanted to check that out. I was under the impression HH was til 6pm but once we arrived I learned we only had 3 min left because it is actually from 2-5pm. Well, our greeter told us she'd send our server right over and he did arrive quickly so we placed our order for a few things that caught our eye right away: grilled cheese sliders, pretzel and cheese fondue and chips with onion dip, a beer and a glass of sangria. Later we also added their wings which were absolutely fantastic btw. We get our drinks and my GF loves her beer that our server mentioned she might like based on her tastes & I loved my sangria! We are just engaged in conversation enjoying this beautiful place, the light is so great, we loved all the games they have on the outside part and all the couches, just everything about it is awesome. We asked the hostess when she passed by about the availability for some of the rooms where they hold events and she gave us a ton of information and feedback as well as cards on whom to contact regarding holding an event there. It's so awesome when an employee can share more information about a place they work in even if it has nothing to do with their exact job description. I don't remember her name but thought, wow, she genuinely seems very happy to work here and after looking around we realized pretty much everyone seemed genuinely happy to be there. Our server was great as well, super attentive and helpful with any questions we had at any point. Our food was ridiculous. Let me explain, it's a small-ish menu but these are THE BEST PRETZELS & cheese ever! Just get them already and say hello to carbs, it's so worth it! The cheese sauce was something else too, it consistently stayed warm and creamy over fire (the way it's brought out to your table), a great touch! Chips and dip was fantastic and the grilled cheese sliders were good but I kinda wished they had tomato as well. You might be thinking we ordered too many things with cheese and sauce, well I don't eat meat so other than a salad I didn't have a lot of options. I will still come back, granted if you're a vegan or vegetarian you may have a hard time finding something but the drinks, service, vibe are worth it. We are definitely coming back with friends and family and will reach out for more info on hosting an event there. What a beautiful place. Can't wait to go back and listen to some live music next time.",

    "text": "I came here last week and had a bad experience, but Haley (one of the managers) reached out to me and brought me back in. I was so happy that she did. The experience I had must have been a one-off because it felt like night and day. I brought my husband with me and we arrived a little early for our reservation, but they were happy to accomodate us. We are big sports fans and the seating arrangement is great so that everyone can see the TVs with multiple games on no matter where you sit.   I recommend the pretzels and cheese as your appetizer, just don't fill up on those before you get a chance to have something from the antipasti menu. Our main course consisted of the fried chicken and the steak. Both were amazing! I'm usually the type to just order appetizers and not entrees, but I wouldn't recommend that here, because the entrees are so well crafted.   Joel was our server and he was great! He made the best recommendations and he knew what he was talking about. When you asked him for a suggestion he wouldn't just make a suggestion, he would give you details about why he thought things would pair well and he gave a preview of what to expect.  A lot of managers and business owners have gotten tired if the phrase \"the customer is always right\" and I have gotten several defensive and rude comments back when I give anything less than a 4 star rating on yelp. However, Culinary Dropout appears to truly value their customer's experience and is invested in ensuring that not just their food,  but their brand is top quality.",

Seating is personal, comfortable and very nice.  The staff is awesome and never did I have to ask fo a refill or anything. My server knew the menu really well and was able to help us choose what we wanted to eat.   Appetizer: the pretzels and cheese was AMAZING! Great portion for sharing win 3-4 people   Dinner: honey fried chicken meal. I wasn't too impressed with this dish. Honestly they honey in the seasoning was a little strange for me and I love eating honey with my chicken strips but not so much blended in with he seasoning. The dish itself was filling and had three sides which included a biscuit, mashed potatoes and coleslaw ( I think  ) I cant really remember the last option.   I would recommend this place to anyone.",

    "text": "If you're young, beautiful and hip this is the place to be on a weekend. Yet if you're like us, a little less young and hip you can still blend in. You can make a reservation on Open Table, which I would suggest because the secret is out about this place and it got progressively busier throughout the night.   The ambiance inside is fun, relaxed, with a dining room area and then a lounge area outside where people were lounging on sofas and playing games. It was really quite unique. In the dining area there is also a stage where there is a difference band that plays live music nightly.   We started with the pretzels and fondue app as well as the BBQ pork nachos. The pretzels were served hot, soft on the inside and the provolone fondue dip was creamy and delicious without being overwhelming. The nachos were layered with guacamole, sour cream and thick chunks of sweet BBQ pork.   For my entree I settled on the Fried chicken served with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy, a biscuit, and coleslaw. The mashed potatoes left something to be desired, reminded me of an elementary school lunch. The coleslaw was delicious, light and carefully seasoned. The chicken had a great crispy coating with tender juicy meat. The biscuit was large and a little heavier than I like my biscuits.  My husband got the French dip with added jalapenos at the suggestion of our waiter. The meat was tender and juicy. The bread was a little soggy for my preference even before the dip. Overall a solid sandwich.   We had a great experience and lingered for an extra hour or so. Our waiter never once made us feel rushed and he refilled our drinks regularly without us even having to ask. Overall very happy with the service and experience. Definitely put this on your list of Saturday night dinner spots if you're looking for a good time.",

We came for the dinner table. We started with Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue, which needs to be eaten there every time. My wife had the Chili, which was not spicy but had a deep smokey flavor and bright tomato flavor. For dinner I had the BBQ Pork Belly Nachos, which was big enough for two or three. Overall great service. The food took a while but it was packed. Contrary to other reviews we remarked that it was well staffed and we were able to have our servers attention when needed.",

Great atmosphere, this would be a great venue for a team building event as well. I had the wings and what great flavor, I also had the kale salad with smoked salmon.

    "text": "Came here after work for dinner with some friends.  I've been meaning to check out this place for quite some time because of all of it's raving reviews.  First and foremost, parking.  There's tons of parking space which is great! However, this place is seriously popular, especially after work around 5PM. Despite the relatively large parking space, almost all of the spots were taken -- my roommate and I got lucky and pulled in as someone was pulling out. I will note that there is complimentary valet though (bring cash, just in cash! Don't forget to tip!)  Now onto the interior. Gorgeous, gorgeous place. From the floors, to the walls, to the women's bathroom, to the relaxed (or absence of?)dress code for the staff... this place is so trendy and hip! I'm especially fond of the lights (they dim then around 6pm!). I'd definitely love to get a little dressed up and go here to grab some drinks with my friends. This is the perfect place for that.  The staff? The staff was great! Super accommodating and responsive. Constantly checking in on how our group was doing. Loved it.  Now for the appetizers. We had two appetizers: the pretzel and provolone fondue as well as the pork rib nachos. Both were fantastic and very easy to share. So much flavor and cheese! I love cheese. I'd love to try all of the other apps (I'm thinking the wings next time!)  As for the entrees, I ordered the Italian grinder with a cheap house salad on the side. The salad was awesome! It's presentation definitely did not match up with its name. Now, the Italian grinder looked quite delicious (I asked for lots of jalapenos in it!) but man.. it just wasn't good. I was pretty full from the apps so this may have contributed to it, but geez, I really couldn't bring myself to finish the sandwich. So I asked for a to-go box and decided to save it for tomorrow's lunch.  When I got home, I had a HORRIBLE stomach ache (I'll spare you the details). I told all my friends thinking that maybe the appetizers were the cause. Everyone else was fine, except for me. Perhaps I had something else to eat earlier on in the day that upset my stomach? So I gave the sandwich another shot.  NOPE NOPE NOPE. Eating the remainder of my sandwich ended up with the same results. I learned my lesson. I am never, ever going near the Italian grinder again.   I didn't have the most positive first experience here... I will definitely go back to this place for some drinks and apps and MAYBE some of the other entrees but in all honesty, none of them really caught my eye -- which is how I ended up with the sandwich.  At the end of the day, this is the perfect place for some apps and drinks, but I don't think I'd ever come here for dinner. But who knows? Maybe next time I'll change my mind and work up the courage to give some of the other entrees a shot. Maybe I'll check out the location in Scottsdale or Phoenix. Until then, my stomach and I will definitely be avoiding the dining area at this location for the foreseeable future. If I ever go back, you can find me at the bar.",

It is a college hangout with ASU a stones throw away so you have a mix crowd but mostly with college kids. They have a nice outdoor area with couches and pool and bags. The food was good, service could be better and the prices vary depending on what you're there for but I guess average.   While it is cool, I felt very old and out of place even being in my early 30s with my family.",

    "text": "I am a huge fan of Fox Concepts Restaurants, but not this one.  Not much ambience for me with the industrial look, but others seem to like it so maybe it is personal taste.  Went there for the second time today - this time  for happy hour.  No wine on the happy hour menu and the food offerings were deeply discounted, but sparse.  I had the meatloaf sandwich and finally found the meatloaf after peeling off the huge layer of bread on top.  As a Tempe resident, I am very excited to have this new Fox restaurant and hope it does well, but it is off the beaten path and pricey and will have to compete with other new places like Postino, which offers pitchers of craft beer for $5 and wine for $5/glass until 5 pm plus delicious food and wonderful ambience in the beautifully refurbished  old Annex Building on the ASU campus.  The service was great.  I sat at the bar and the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Good luck, Culinary Drop Out.  We want you to succeed.",

We enjoyed our food so we will be back for sure. This time though I might have to bring my own hot sauce since their only options are tobacco cholula and sriracha, & you just Can't have fried chicken and Not have Louisiana hot sauce!! So that was disappointing but the chicken was still delicious. The batter is slightly sweet & im not a big fan of sweet entrees but this was subtle and the chicken was tender & juicy so I have to say that I liked it more than LoLo's. Which I'm sure is a big statement for some people. Lol my biscuit Was (I capitalize because I ate that $hit up!) fluffy, buttery, & sweet.  4 year old daughter ate everything up which is rare so we are happy that money wasn't wasted! Shell type of noodles, a pretty good serving size & Parmesan was easy to eat.  Hubby says his plate was amazingly tasty. Period. He was satisfied so overall we had a great experience.  Service was good. He (Conner) had quite a few tables so I just had to make sure not to forget anything when he did come around.",

It is an extremely casual atmosphere with great decor.  There are various activities like cornhole and ping ping to play.    The food menu is a great.  There is a wide variety to suit all levels of adventure.  The fried chicken is a great choice.    The drink menu is plentiful and they have very creative twists on old classics.",

First off, all of the bags boards were occupied so we decided to attempt shuffle board...well there was only one set of weights and they were apparently \"checked\" out to someone and there WEREN'T even playing so we were a little pissed that they didn't have an extra set ... we will talk bout extra sets in a minute. Then we asked about playing beer pong at an open table they said they don't do that there so we went and got paddles to play actual ping pong. It was hard as hell because you could barely see the ball whizzing at you with the dim lighting...fail. Last, once we finally saw an empty/ not used board for bags, I went and checked one set of bags out. I even had all of our bags set up and ready to play  when my friend got back from getting us more drinks...and they had checked another set of bags out to someone right after me and they tried to play 'teams' with the four of us...that made us pretty aggravated because WHY in the HELL would you check out more bags than you have boards to play on. Makes NO Sense.   Overall, I used to recommend this place to people asking about something fun to do in Tempe but I don't think I can do that anymore.",

We were seated immediately and our server was quick to get drinks and an appetizer started. The $5 pretzels and fondue appetizer was delicious, probably the best I've ever had.  Then I got the fried chicken and it was great as well. Overall it was a great experience and the restaurant atmosphere was great. I will definitely be back again.",

The atmosphere is big and loud with live music in the evenings.  The food had exceptional moments and even those dishes that missed exceptional where just off the edge.   The menu is creative if a bit limited and exceptionally fresh. Build your own Antipasti is a nice way to start and if you get there early order the Korean rib cap which is a favorite but runs out early.  Come to have fun, enjoy the loud atmosphere, people watch, corn hole and have a very good food and beverage along the way.",

That night was freezing and the outside heaters kept us warm... I just wish they had a bigger area to eat out food because our table had a bonfire type thing in the middle and my fave felt like it was melting when I was eating my food lol.  I got the chicken sandwich and it was sooooo good! I was very happy with it... And my friend got the ravioli... She let me try some of it and I wanna go back and order some for myself! The PaB buger was delicious too!

Our server was highly attentive the whole night. We never had an empty glass or plate for long. We had the bbq pork nachos and pretzel roll fondue. The fondue was great, who doesn't love melted cheese? And the pretzel rolls were surprisingly not dry and delicious. The nachos used real cheese but were already cold by the time they arrived to our table.  I ordered the ribs and they were decent. The meat was cooked well, not fall off the bone but very tender, but the sauce was a little overpowering.   Overall a good experience for a trendy night out.",

    "text": "Every time I tell someone I ate at Culinary Dropout, they give me the same blank stare. If you could see the puzzled look on their face, you'd know they are trying to resolve this oxymoron.  Last week, I met a business colleague for lunch at the Tempe location. My previous visits here were around happy hour and dinner. Lunch time is busier than I expected, so I'm glad we arrived early. It was a gorgeous day sandwiched between the recent rain storms, so we were happy to sit on the patio.  Speaking of sandwiches, I selected an excellent salad! I'm a big fan of seared Ahi Tuna. Who knew how good it could be on a simple chopped salad? And it's even better when paired with cashews, avocado, and sesame seeds with an Asian dressing. The portion of the salad and the Tuna were both very generous. This was a New Year's resolution kind of meal, but I'd be happy to enjoy a salad like this all year long.  The vibe at mid-day is unusual. Having seen this restaurant/bar/lounge/game room in full swing in the evening, lunch feels like the calm before the storm. To be more specific, this storm has a unique atmosphere, excellent service, a laid back attitude, great food and drinks, and lots of fun activities on the patio.  Culinary Dropout is a just a hop, skip and an illegal U-turn off of Mill Ave. Stop standing there with that look on your face and check this place out!",

We waited about 40mjn for a table which is fine.. but they had originally stated it would be about 15min and only seated us in a rush when we were about to walk out the door because we both had to be up at 4am the next morning! We were happy with our food but the whole experience just wasn't up to par with how expensive the food was. Maybe it's worth it if you are going here to drink the night away.",

We always get the pretzel bites to start - it comes with a yummy cheese fondue.   Great service, good food.  Just be prepared for a wait during busy times!",

The cheese isn't too sharp or harsh, great complement to the pretzels. The pretzels are almost like rolls, tender and satisfying.   Drink: Deviant Behavior. Fruity and not syrupy sweet, can't taste the alcohol at all, I could easily drink this too fast. They give you the rest of the can of beer... which is great but I wish they would refill the strawberry and lemon too.   I got the prime rib dip sandwich and wasn't thrilled. Good roll, tender meat, but not exciting. Just meat, bread and cheese, good basic sandwich. My sister in law got the fried chicken, I wish I got that. It was crispy and juicy and the honey was a good touch.   Great place for groups but very loud, you'll have to shout to hear each other.",

Someone from my office pre-planned our entire menu, which was a bummer at first since I wanted to order a bunch of stuff, but they ended up picking a bunch of good stuff so it worked out.   Food:  Pretzel Bread & Cheese Dip - BEST. EVER. I basically filled up on these... Thai Chili Chicken Wings - Best chicken wings I've had tbh House Potatoes & Onion Dip - Needed waaaaaay more dip Turkey Pastrami Sliders - More pretzel bread win but kinda dry. Grilled Cheese Sandwiches - Just okay. Nothing extraordinary. Roasted Garlic Hummus - Also just okay. I got sick of bread at this point.  Drinks:  After School Special - 7/5 - Cocktail AND Beer? Yes.  Velvet Death 5/5 - Gin everything always please. Room Service - 100/5 - I think I ordered 4 of these. So good...  Place had awesome energy and entertainment. I wish we had these or anything even remotely like these in California! Great vibes, foods and drinks. I hope to go back before my trip is over and try out more stuff on the menu.",

    "text": "I went here with my hubby for a date night. He went here twice before he took me for work meetings. He wanted to take me because he knew I would appreciate their food and vibe.   I was pretty excited about the space. It is super urban and it kind of reminds me of restaurants I would see in Washington DC. So it did remind me of home so I was pretty happy about that. (My hubby knows me so well.) The space itself literally reminds me of an upscale warehouse. It's urban and funky. The vibe is very positive. They have live music on the weekends. So the atmosphere is even more funky just because of that alone.   As far as the food, it's pretty good.   I have to do a side note for those who follow my review and know that I love Korean food. You may wonder why I did not try their kimchi dishes.... I did not try their kimchi options because I grew up on Korean food. So if their Kimchi was not up to standard I would have been instantly disappointed in the place so I opted to go for a no kimchi dish. (Side note: I'm confused why they would do Korean fusion in a place like this... but then again I'm pretty picky about my Korean food... sorry for complaining)   So to avoid instant disappointment from my love of kimchi I opted for their ribs instead. It was pretty good. It was fall of the bone soft and the sauce was layered with flavor.   I also recommend their roasted beet appetizer.   I will digress again... I also saw the cutest party space near their restrooms. This would be the perfect spot for a rehearsal dinner!!",

    "text": "It is with a heavy heart that I write this review today.  As a chef in the industry, I've always respected the work that Fox Restaurants Concepts have done. Over the years I have frequented most of the restaurants in the valley and have enjoyed the food, service and environment.  There have been several times over the years where if something wasn't right it was always corrected without any issues...great service.  Let's back track to 4 weeks ago, when I ordered the vegan curry.  Good stuff there.  Always delicious.  However, this time when it was placed in front of me, the sweet potato was burnt.  Not just on one side, but on both.  I gave it straight back to my server and told her I wasn't eating that.  She informed me that it was \"always cooked that way\".  That's funny because I've had that dish at least a dozen time and never once has it come out burnt.  I don't know about anyone else, but I don't enjoy food that's been rendered to ash.  She did remedy the problem, but towards the end of my dining experience I discover the end of the eggplant with the stem on it.  It's never a good experience having to spit out your food in front of guests you invited with a great recommendation. When I pointed out the stem to the server she never said a word about it.  No apology or anything.  However, she did give me the \" you're a bitch\" look. Thanks for that by the way.  Always lovely in front of guests.    Now, let's move on to two weeks ago.  My family showed up on a Saturday afternoon wanting to enjoy our time together.  By the time we were seated we all decided that the noise level was unbearable and we left.    Now, let's focus on today.  Friday at 11:00 am, my husband and I wanted to enjoy a day together, so we show up at The Yard.  After being seated, the noise level wasn't too bad, because there was hardly anyone there.  The music was louder than normal, but I could still hear my husband and have a conversation with him.  As more and more patrons show up, the noise level became unbearable.  Because the music was so loud, everyone had to talk louder to hear each other. Half way through our lunch I asked our server if the music was normally that loud and she said she'd see if they could turn it down. Of course the level of music wasn't changed, because she could hear just fine and of course didn't see an issue with it.  I have to tell you, I've never been so frustrated with a restaurant experience as I have had today.  Looking around 90% of your clientele are 40 and up, with many in suits having business meetings.  The loud party bar environment you are creating for a weekday lunch experience is outrageous.  I understand the hip culture you are trying to create.  Believe me, I do, but you are alienating your 40 and up clientele, with the party atmosphere.  When we first started patronizing your restaurant, the music was loud enough to enjoy, yet you could also enjoy your conversation.   I think I've had enough frustration with your environment and will leave you all to do what you do, but it's not like my dollar will hurt your business.",

The Tempe location adds a completely different vibe but has the same delicious food and bar drinks. With a large outdoor area filled with bar games, tons of TVs, rooms for having meetings/parties and an indoor/outdoor bar set up its perfect for anyone looking to have a great night out! I don't have a specific favorite item on the menu but every bar snack we ordered was fabulous. Try the fried chicken or the prime rib dip, the pretzel bites, snack boards, heck just order one of everything on the menu. The atmosphere in my opinion is perfect for what I look for in a restaurant. Catering to my need for sports, well made drinks/food and great service Culinary Dropout wherever the location, is my favorite place to go in the Phoenix area.",

We didn't have to wait long for seats at the bar and for the table section beside the bar (tall marble-topped tables with stools) to open up. We were perfectly happy to order drinks and appetizers while we waited, but to our delight, we were able to order from the entire menu.   The food!!! We started with the pork belly nachos and these honestly might have been my favorite. Amazing flavor. Our table also ordered the pierogis, which were delicious, and the soft pretzels with cheese sauce, which were lethal & addictive. I ordered the steak salad and loved it. Everyone in my party of 6 gave the food rave reviews.   The service!!! Our waiter was not only attentive and on top of things, but he was so friendly and sweet. We had several other waitresses who would stop by to collect empty plates and check in on our drink refills regularly, and they were just as friendly and sweet. It was such a fun, relaxed, and friendly atmosphere. I would absolutely return if I am ever in the Tempe area again. The only thing I would do differently is perhaps make a reservation to sit at one of their tables or plush-looking booths.",

I will say the servers dress casual a lot of trendy outfits and need to say no bras. The server got the pork nachos and my friend got the pretzel with provolone fondue. We shared and it was so yummy. At first I was sad cuz the cheese for the nachos was scarce but the server brought me a big bowl and it made me so happy. Honestly I left completely full and did not spend as much money as the items must have been on happy hour. Overall I ended up very satisfied and full and who doesn't like saving money",

    "text": "Happy New Year! Well, it's official - January has flown by and I'm not even sure where time is going!! I hope everyone had a great celebration to ring in the New Year. My husband and I dined at Culinary Dropout on NYE to take advantage of their amazing three course meal.  We went straight into \"treat-yo-self\" mode when we got there and started off with Korean Style Brussels Sprouts and the Bacon & Parmesan Grissini from their Antipasti menu. My husband found the Brussels Sprouts to be his favorite item the entire night; I was on board with the Grissini which were basically really long breadsticks (not sure how to describe them)!  For our main meal, I went with the Smoked Salmon Toast / Fried Chicken / Apple Crisp. My husband went with Sweet Potato Pierogis / Fried Chicken / S'mores dessert.  It was kind of difficult to pick which of the starters we liked more, both were good in different ways! I actually preferred the Pierogis because the dish was a little bit of sweet & salty but the Smoked Salmon Toast had a good flavor also. Now, my husband and I typically don't get the same entree when we go to a restaurant so we can share but if there's one place to do it, it would be at Culinary Dropout - their fried chicken is always super crunchy and tasty. No regrets on this choice! Both desserts were good but if I had to pick again, I'd go with the S'mores; it was very rich & decadent but amazing. I'm typically not a huge chocolate person but I really enjoyed this dessert!  Overall, a great meal. We did go early in the evening with a reservation so we were seated immediately. They have a nice bar area plus games if you're waiting for your table and have some time. I'll go ahead and keep my rating at 4 stars after multiple visits!",

Wide ranging menu, with lots of options, including Gluten Free. Offered are amped-up pub-type appetizers, salads, sandwiches and entrees!  Atmosphere: Soulful surroundings. Large area for a variety of activities.-Yard Games and Live Music for the whole family too!   In our party of 5 we had : shaved prime rib dip, pub burger, roasted salmon, butternut squash cannelloni & the Korean style ribeye caps.  Presentation on all meals was exquisite...   I do have to say- I was a little bummed, they no longer have the Raviolis. Our server suggested the cannelloni & that it was very similar. Agreed and it's just as delicious. The Ribeye Caps ( prepared medium) was extraordinary... Highly suggest one of these two dishes.   The GM checked in on us many times throughout our visit. Friendly, engaging & professional.   Ended the evening with a deconstructed apple pie & a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Yum!  Stellar service, staff & experience.",

Great music, and a fun assortment of drinks (pink Cadillac margaritas and pomegranate mules were good but the green jalapeno margarita was not). The pretzel bites you dip in warm cheese are a must! We also tried the nachos which were good. For dinner, several of us had the steak tacos which were good but super spicy for this spice lightweight. We were far too full for dessert but enjoyed a few fun rounds of ping pong and cornhole to wrap up the evening. Our server was very friendly, offered good advice, and was attentive to our needs. Overall a great, casual night of relaxation.",

    "text": "My family and I came here for my 22nd birthday, and HONESTLY the food was WAY better than I thought it would be. Our bill was over 200$, for 8 people. Which in my eyes is PRICEY, but well worth it. Our waiter reminded us of TV character, and he kinda disappeared for a bit, as well as forgot some of our sides which we had to ask twice for, no big deal. Our food took awhile to come out, and didn't come all at once for the group so we had to wait a bit. Granted is was busy, but still kinda sucked. You would think that such a big place with super hip vibes would have AC inside but alas is does not, doesn't even have fans inside. I recommend trying the sweet corn ravioli or the fried chicken, super bomb. If you have room for dessert I'd recommend the s'more dessert. So good, even though it's obvious it's premade and already starting to separate as you eat it - it's amazing still. I'd recommend coming as a date night rather than a group just because of the price. Overall, amazing experience, pricey bill, and no AC. You would also think with how big their hype is, that their menu would be bigger. There's only one vegan option (a spicy curry), and a few things to choose from. Their menu is based off of a cheese and meat plate which takes up most of the menu, although they do have a wide variety of alcohol. Service could be better.   Update: we made a reservation for 5:30pm, my husband and bestfriend and I got there a little after 5, and we got seated around 5:15p which was nice. But as we got seated, the hostess asked us to be finished by 745pm because they had a reservation for this table at 8pm - which REALLY bothered me. My family and I are here to celebrate, and if we take a little bit we take a little bit, we're paying a HUGE bill to begin with - I feel it was a tad unprofessional to ask us to be finished by a certain time.",

My wife ordered the Pretzel and Fondue as an appetizer and it was huge!  And it was deliciousness!  As a dinner course she ordered a Spicy Curry which I tried and we both liked it.  Her dessert course was a Banana Cream Pie which was ridiculously good.  I ordered Hot Wings for an appetizer and it was quite good.  Dinner course I had their house specialty Fried Chicken, I would do it again.  I also ordered the Banana Cream Pie and it to me was the highlight.  Not downplaying the other food that I ordered but it was amazing!    So my wife and I enjoyed our visit and we liked the band playing, although it was loud, it was hard to carry a conversation.    Our friends didn't enjoy themselves at all.  I'm not sure why we had such different experiences.  So I am giving them 4 stars because it wasn't just about us.",

It'd be phenomenal as beer cheese given the environs.   We had the chitterlings which the naive young woman serving us pronounced \"chit-ter-LINGS\". it's not her fault. That's how it's spelled. But these chitlins' were tasty.   He had the turkey pastrami. It had good flavor and a healthy portion.   I had the fried chicken. It's crispy, yes. Even bordering on burned. But it's bland! I wish they'd have served some hot sauce. The mashed potatoes felt too smooth like instant. The biscuit would have been better if warm.   Overall I expected much more since I ordered nearly all house favorites.   I would not go back. There are other options to explore before a return trip.",

It's inside what looks like a large brick wear-house with some event space and retail shops in the front. Once you get in the restaurant it's very open with a large two sided bar in the center that splits the area in half. I would advise making a reservation as it was totally booked when we arrived at 545pm on a Wednesday. We ended up sitting at the bar which worked out well as we were able to watch some of the basketball games. I had the Ahi Tuna for an appetizer and a steak salad for my main course. The Ahi tuna was different but good and my steak was cooked perfectly. If your in the  Phoenix/Tempe area I would definitely recommend checking this place out.",

Mostly professionals and dating couples. We went with another group to celebrate. Service was fast and flawless. Our waiter had a great grasp of the menu. The meatloaf was very tender and I was worried about the ketchup sauce being regular and bland but the flavor was very savory and had some kick to it. The fried chicken is very good and fried to perfection. You can tell they take pride in their fried chicken because the chicken tenders we ordered for the kids were juicy and not overcooked. My mother in law had the fish and chips and she kept raving about how fresh the Cole slaw tasted. There is live music, which can be a bit much if you don't like loud music. But being the blues fan that I am it was a great addition to the meal. We did not have to flag the waiter down at all her was on top of everything for our visit! Great ambience and we will be back!

    "text": "Where do I begin? I'll start with saying, the night could've been one of the best nights but quickly turned to the worst. All thanks to the bearded, wannabe hippie, JERK of a bartender named Brandon and the unprofessional, rude \"manager\" of the night, Bryan Carter.   Let me back up, the food was amazing. Probably the best food I've had. Service though...absolutely terrible. We had a freak ping pong accident where a guy in our party cut his head open. The bartender couldn't have been more rude and unprofessional about it. He complained about helping him get a rag, having to clean up a little blood (literally four drops), and gave us nothing but a bad attitude the entire time we were at the bar.   Moving onto the joke of a manager. After the ping pong incident, we were harassed by a fellow customer. After explaining the situation to the \"manager\", he rolled his eyes and told us there was nothing he could do. Well, there's a lot you could do but you're too lazy to do it.   I'll end my rant now. But just know, I will never be back. No one from our party will be back. Which is quite unfortunate. Because it is a very delicious restaurant but not worth the harassment and disrespect.",

    "text": "Fox Restaurants is part of my portfolio of good eats, however Culinary Dropout in Tempe is not 1 of them. First off; the make up air system for the exhaust grease hoods is waaayyy off, when you enter the building you experience the \"wiff\" of a back alley Japanese teppanyaki grease fryer-smoke sensation, I had to drop off my clothes at the dry cleaners the next morning to rid this odor. If your not familiar with make up air its the air that is pumped in from the roof to provide the exhaust grease hood to make up for the air its exhausting, sometimes too close to an HVAC unit on the roof it gets pumped in for the patrons to breathe and smell. Second; the layout feels like a junior high school cafeteria with tables lined up in parallel, with all the \"cool kids\" having fun tossing bags of beans back and forth in the adjoining Yard. Third; our server was pleasant, speedy, but lacked a smile, maybe had a bad day who knows? Fourth; we ordered the \"36 hour pork ribs\", mistake, they were cold, apx. room temperature or just below, I felt like a cave man chewing the hard to separate meat off the bone, after which we asked where the restrooms were so we could wash our hands from all of the bbq sauce, our server pointed the way down a dreary hallway, why don't they provide a wet nap at minimum, for the $25 plate they should provide a hot towel!   Culinary Dropout is a great matching name for the restaurant, I think every one staffed there may just be Drop Outs...",

While I am no longer in college, I didn't feel like this was a location that only served collegiate customers, there appeared to be all age groups enjoying the company of everyone.  We sat in the back, pass the bags and ping pong tables and it was a great atmosphere for talking to your group or meeting new people. While the menu is limited here, or it could have been the time (we arrived around 8 p.m.) the food was delicious. I had the Thai wings and several of my peers ordered the cheese and pretzels. The beer selection is pretty decent, for this time of year a lot of the micro brews have holiday selections, I recommend the Sleepy Dog.  Despite the large crowd, the waitress was amazing and attended to our requests with a smile on our face (did I mention we were a large crowd??) I wish I had her name to give her a shout out! But all of the waiters seemed to be really on point. I am hoping this place becomes a regular for my friends, I couldn't be more happy with my experience.",

My date ordered a side salad that came out right away. Then my salad eventually came out & it tasted good.  He ordered a chicken sandwich that must have taken over 30 minutes or longer so we never ate dinner at the same time. Very weird. The GM came to our table since he realized it took so long. Told us dinner was on the house. Then the quirky waiter came back and charged us for my tea that I never got the sweetener for & the salad. I don't plan to return after this first experience.

The pros were definitely the large space (great for events!), easy convenient free parking, tasty drinks, and nice outdoor concept area with games and couches. The cons were the heat and humidity that made sitting in the outdoor area uncomfortable (everyone was soaked in sweat), overpriced food and drinks, and surly staff. My co worker had a dog and was rudely informed by 6 different staff members that dogs weren't allowed. I get it, but you can be a little nicer about it. Not necessary for 6 people to give her a hard time. She ended up leaving immediately because she couldn't stay with the dog. The drinks were very expensive- $10 to $12 for their underwhelming and small cocktails. Tasty but expensive. I had some sangria and it was $8 a glass and delicious but weak. Also very small especially considering how much ice was in the cup. The service was surly and there was a lot of pressure to keep ordering more and more. It was clear that they do not want you to hang out on the couches unless you are quickly and consistently spending lots of money. Again I get it but you can make it a little less known. I would definitely come back but I would manage your expectations with this place. Know what you're getting into. This is not your friendly neighborhood bar.",

We went here for a team meeting and all the food was indeed a culinary delight.   They were thoughtful and accommodating for our one gluten free coworker.  They run out of the Korean steak, but when we called ahead they made sure our table had 6 scrumptious perfectly cooked steaks.  I've been to several culinary dropouts, but this location is my favorite due to the structure and entire feel of the complex.",

The aesthetic of the place was really cool and laid back. But the food was overpriced and not tasty at all. We shared the pork belly nachos which seemed like velveta cheese melted on chips with barely any toppings other than that. My brother got the fish and chips which came with flimsy fries and I got the tacos which was 17$ for 3 tiny tacos that in my opinion weren't that good. If you want a casual place to drink go for it but as far as food goes don't waste your money.",

If you sit near the walls you get no phone service which isn't a huge deal. Food and service great but the time cut offs for happy hour and brunch not so great.",

It had the consistency of whipped cream, but definitely tasted like a good mild Brie. We substituted salad for fries as the ribs' side order, and without asking they plated the ribs split for us, including splitting the salad and excellent Cole slaw. We were going to skip dessert, but our great server made it too easy to fall for the Monkey Bread. Yummy! We could have spent hours here, but our layover was too short.",

Thankfully there were televisions scattered about so we could watch the early game while grabbing a late lunch.  We started with the Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue. This was a nice way to start the meal. You get quite a lot so it is a great appetizer to share for a large table. The pretzels are good, but its the provolone fondue that makes this really good. It was creamy and tasty.  For my meal I ordered the Turkey Pastrami. It comes on a pretzel roll and is topped with swiss and coleslaw. It was a hearty and tasty sandwich. It certainly will fill you up. The different flavors and textures come together nicely. I am a big fan of slaw on sandwiches so it was good out of the gate for me.  We did not take advantage of it but there is a large area for games like cornhole and shuffleboard. It certainly would make for a fun night with friends over drinks.",

Every time the service is on point and we are well taken care of.  The food is always delicious and we leave happy and feeling good.  We have had private events here in their dining rooms which was an awesome experience.  They served a preset menu with everything being shared. It was fantastic. Most recently we dined in the regular area but in a large group, also with a preset menu to order from.  We have a lot of Keto folks currently and even though we had a menu, they accommodated a number of special requests like pros, including substituting fresh veggies in to dip in the cheese sauce.  There was literally not one complaint in the group.   They keep the drinks flowing. And while a couple were mixed up, they fixed immediately.  The best part is that after dinner you can play some table tennis or corn hole.  Our group loves to be competitive so this is a great way to end the evening.will definitely keep coming back here for sure.",

While we were waiting, we loved watching the kitchen prep through the large windows.  We were seated promptly at 7:00pm.    This place is pretty loud (the outside is noisier than the inside), but we got a seat in an area that wasn't too bad (opposite side from the hostess desk).    Our server was nice and highly efficient.    We ordered the fried chicken dinner and the steak salad so we could split the two.  The salad was very good with the best blue cheese dressing that I've ever tasted.  The fried chicken came with 3 pieces: breast, thigh and leg.  We typically prefer dark meat, but the chicken breast was the tenderest we've ever had.  The chicken had good crunch and was nicely seasoned.  The mashed potatoes were good with an onion gravy.  The Cole slaw was very nice, on the sweet side.  My husband didn't care for the biscuit, but I liked it.  It seemed like a cross between a corn bread and a biscuit.    The food came out in about 15-20 minutes.  Not bad.    They have free valet parking so it will only cost you a tip.  The guys were super nice.  Other than the noise level, this is a very good spot for dinner.",

    "text": "3/16/2019 Yelp Review Culinary Dropout Tempe, AZ The Yard at Farmer Arts District 149 S Farmer (480) 240-1601        Since coming to Arizona for college, Culinary Dropout has been my favorite restaurant by far for several reasons. Whether I am with my boyfriend, my family, or a large group of friends and family for a birthday dinner, Culinary Dropout is a go-to restaurant for any occasion. I have only positive things to say about Culinary Dropout as it has significantly exceeded my expectations in a restaurant.         To start, my roommate and I had a joint birthday dinner on March 19th at Culinary Dropout. We invited a group of about ten friends, and both of our parents came since they were in town for the weekend. Culinary Dropout is located inside the Yard at Farmer Arts District, and we were seated in the outside patio area of the restaurant. The outdoor area of the restaurant is very spacious, and guests are able to claim the couches and chairs for their parties without a reservation. My dad and grandpa went to the restaurant earlier in the evening in order to claim a couch in the outdoor area to accommodate our large party. The ambiance of Culinary Dropout is unlike any other restaurant. For instance, guests are able to play cornhole, foosball, ping-pong, and shuffleboard in the outdoor area as well while they wait for their food or their table. Further, the restaurant atmosphere is hip, lively, and loud. The inside area of the restaurant looks very similar to a gastropub and even has a small stage that cover bands perform live at on weekends. The outdoor area of the restaurant feels like a college bar on Mill, including two bars, large couches, several large TV's playing sports games, and an area for guests to play games. Unfortunately, the downside of choosing to eat at Culinary Dropout is that the restaurant always has significantly long wait times, so a reservation for any party size is a must.         At the birthday dinner, our group ordered the Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue as an appetizer, and it is one of the best items on Culinary Dropout's menu. When the appetizer was served, the soft pretzels were warm, and the provolone fondue was perfectly melted. This appetizer always gets eaten in a very short amount of time because it is very delicious and not too heavy. The menu is not very extensive, but it offers a wide variety of foods and drinks. Most importantly, Culinary Dropout offers options on their menu for people with dietary restrictions and allergies. Whenever I eat at this restaurant, I try to order something different every time because their food is phenomenal. At the birthday dinner last Saturday, several of the girls and I ordered the Beer Battered Fish & Chips which is one of Culinary Dropout's most popular dishes. This was the first time I ordered fish and chips from Culinary Dropout and it was probably the best fish and chips dish that I have ever eaten. The beer battered fish was perfectly cooked, and the fries were very delicious, crispy, and lightly salted.         The pricing of the food and drinks on the menu are considered to be overpriced for some; but in my opinion, the pricing is very fair because the food is exceptional compared to other restaurants. The fish and chips dish that I ordered at the birthday dinner was $16.50 which I believe is a fair price point because the dish was relatively large and I was able to take a lot of it home for leftovers.         The service at Culinary Dropout is incredible. The waiter that served us was very patient with us and was very friendly. The waiter suggested several dishes and appetizers for us to consider ordering. I was really appreciative that our waiter did not hover over us because our group was not in any rush to leave and we were enjoying our time there. Our appetizer and entrees were both served to us faster than expected even though we had a large party. Our waiter also brought out two monkey bread desserts for both my roommate and me with candles on them so that our group could sing Happy Birthday to us which was super sweet. I am always impressed by the friendliness of the waiters at Culinary Dropout, and I believe this restaurant has great service.         Overall, I gave Culinary Dropout five stars out of five because of the fun atmosphere, phenomenal food and drinks, fair price points, and excellent service. I recommend Culinary Dropout to anyone who is looking for a fun restaurant with great food in the Tempe area! Just be sure to make a reservation in advance to avoid long wait times. [775 words]",

    "text": "After being disappointed with the typical Friday evening 90 minute waits we made a reservation. After the reservation hostess found then lost then found my reservation we got right in! Expected more in beer selection but oh well. Loved the Matador drink! Server was great, pleasant and accommodating. One problem we ordered appetizers and dinner at the same time. Entrees were delivered super fast but no apps. :-( They took the entrees away per my request as I didn't want to now wait for the apps and eat the apps while the entrees got cold. Apps were nice and the entrees were yummy. Even went for the monkey bread dessert. Loved the food but should have ordered less but we like to 'try out the menu' when we get to a place first time. Manager was very accommodating with the badly timed service delivery.  Most of the crowd are from the University but we enjoyed and was happy we got to enjoy the food!",

Egg Sandwich- I LOATHE those who fail to melt the damn cheese on an egg sandwich. Seriously, it made the experience go downhill fast. The eggs lacked flavor and became cold and soggy because of the cold, unmelted cheese slice. Also, too much bun vs. eggs. Needs another egg.   Salmon Avocado Toast- the best I've had in the Phoenix area  Pretzels and Fondue- not worth the hype. Perhaps a more course salt or add hatch green chile to the cheese?",

The location is HUGE, lots of meeting space and lots of seating.  Side note: when I walked in a guy was looking for his credit cards he lost the night before, he said he had \"too much fun\" there the night before...lol. I hope he found them.  Anyhow...you can make a reservation here and probably should. It does get busy. I had the salmon - amazing. My client had the meatlof - loved it. We shared the pretzel bites with cheese. OH EHM GEE. I wish I lived in Arizona so I could eat those more often. Those plus apple cider beer would just be heaven.  Ok maybe it's good I don't live in Arizona so I can't eat those all the time. Probably not good for the gut...  In any case, this place is a gem. Definitely check it out. It will suit all food preferences and your foodie friends too.",

The first visit was 5 stars all the way, but the second visit things were not quite as good, so I'll go with 4 stars.  The pretzel starter was awesome on our first visit! So much so that we went back just for these, but on the second visit they came out luke-warm and they didn't light the fire under the dipping sauce so that was cold too. On the first visit, they were nice and warm and awesome.  Food wise I liked the pub burger quite a bit, but the second sandwich I got was not as good. Salads were a bit hit and miss too.  They have many good beers on tap here, so that is a plus.  It is a big place with a large indoor area and also an outdoor area with games like foosball and other things to do. It was really hot when we were visiting so everyone was inside. One the second visit it was busier so we got seated in a separate room inside on a communal table. This room was fine and it was nice that they had some overflow space Vs having to wait.  They do have a nice big parking lot that was free to park at also.",

The large lights, the stage for a mic night, a grassy area for games, and chandeliers and large beautiful lights hanging from the ceiling. The bathrooms have really nice sinks and bathroom doors (strange i know but you gotta go there and see for yourself lOL)  Ok I was kinda salty that they dont give you straws when serving you water.... o.o i spilled everywhere like a little kid lol (mayb its just me but i like straws ok).   The servers wear casual clothes which has its down and up sides to it. It gives the restaurant a more casual and laid back feel but at the same time I dont know who's a worker and who's a customer because everyones dressed in their own clothes...  I ordered the 36-Hour Pork Ribs and the House Smoked Salmon. The Pork ribs were 25$ which is a bit pricey for how a majority of the ribs is ribs and barely any meat.. but i mean its ribs but still. lol. it came with fries and it was way too salty ):  The House smoked salmon waS boOoOoMBBBB. Bread, egg, salmon, sour cream, tomato altogether was just kjsalkjsdfhlkjsd so good. I enjoyed this dish very much. no regrets.   I would definitely come back to try the other items on the menu!",

First, the atmosphere is really neat. I absolutely loved the covered patio and think it would be an awesome place for a large group. They also had some games to play and the vibe was really good.   The service was excellent. The waiter was friendly and our interactions felt genuine and not forced. He was attentive, but not overbearing. Exactly what you want in a waiter.  Now the food...this is the other half of the equation. We tried the prickly pear cider, which was sooo good and left me feeling pretty buzzed after half of a glass. I miiight be outing myself as a bit of a lightweight by saying that, but it definitely has some alcohol to it. We also tried the pretzel fondue and the nachos, both of which were absolutely awesome. We also ordered the shrimp kale caesar salad and the french dip, and both were delicious. I will definitely be back here, probably with a big group, and will eat my heart out again. I cant wait for the one in downtown Gilbert to open up as well!",

I got the fish and chips and while I understand that it is fried, it was literally sitting in the biggest puddle of oil on my plate. I'm not sure why this fish and chips in particular was so greasy, I had to go to the bar and ask for paper napkins to soak to all up. The drinks were average, I didn't bother ordering a second round. For the price of 2 cocktails, 2 entrees that consisted of fried food, and one appetizer that is basically bread and cheese, I was not impressed. With tip I ended up spending almost $90... probably not coming back. I could get better quality for the price elsewhere. Bumped up from 2 stars to 3 only because we had a little leftovers to take home which I always factor in to the price.",

Everything we tried was delicious  Gorgonzola chicken salad - nice balanced salad with a lot of flavor and creaminess from Gorgonzola  Butternut squash cannoli - perfection!  I love pasta with butternut squash and this did not disappoint.  Monkey bread - if you like desserts with a texture contrast and temperature contrast, this was delicious.  Parts of the dessert were crispy from the oven and paired well with the ice cream. +cocktails and drinks - all the cocktails had an interesting twist and were interesting.  I ordered the Room Service and was super happy!  The alcohol is well masked by the strawberry and I could have drank a few of them easily.  -valet staff - so we came around 8p on a Monday and maybe valet service already ended for the night but there are signs everywhere that state valet parking only.  We pulled up to valet and the guys there were all busy talking and ignored us for a few minutes.  Finally one of them said park it yourself.  Thanks guys.",

And the day I went to this place and told the hostess that I have a reservation, and she told me that they have another group come later so we only have two hours. I didn't say anything to her back, but they didn't tell me that we only have two hours when I made a reservation. So I know I shouldn't care about that. I don't remember how long we were there, and they didn't kick us out. Our server was great. My husband complained that our Crunchy Shrimp Caesar Salad had blue cheese crumbs are in it. And he took it off from our check, and he told my husband that he just wants us to have a great experience tonight. We told them that we have 5 kids in our party when I made a reservation, but they didn't give us kid's menu until we asked our server to bring it. I love their pretzel ball,  beef stew was not exciting, Fish & Chips was okay.  And their kid's menu size is big, kind of shocked lol Very noisy, hard to find a parking spot. Fun place to hanging with friends.",

The indoor area is really nice and almost has a \"formal\" feel to it. The outside area is a bit more casual and fun. There are plenty of places to sit and it's great for groups! My only complaint is that the service can be a bit slow, but it's not bad enough to make me give them any less than 5 stars.  They also have live music sometimes, which is phenomenal (not enough places have live music). They also offer valet parking which is nice considering that the parking lot is on the other end of the building.  Overall, this place is great!",

And there was a live band, but the music was not so loud you could still hold a conversation. I really felt relaxed in the place. We had a 15 minute wait for our table, so we decided to sit at the bar seating and get some drinks in the meantime. We ended up just ordering food at the bar and stayed where we were. I honestly prefer bar seating anyway. Service was great. I ordered the Salmon and had captain and soda water for a drink. It was amazing! I don't know how I never knew about this place before.",

    "text": "Didn't know what to expect coming here but we wanted to check out the place everyone had been telling us about. Made reservations then get there and told wait would be about 15 minutes (I hate when that happens, why make reservations then) We decided we'd just sit outside so that we could be seated right away. We get seated and ordered our food when we order drinks. While waiting for our food, I saw three times where food was brought out to the wrong table and I'm thinking how is that happening. After 42 minutes, our food finally arrived (we only ordered the kids mac n cheese, fish and chips and the roasted salmon). My husband's salmon was not cooked completely. After flagging down 1 of our 2 servers, she told us \"yeah, it's normally medium. Let me get that fixed\" and took my husband's plate. The second server had come by the table a few times, only to chat with my 2.5 year old (yeah, odd). So after we sent the salmon back, she comes by again to talk to my son, never asking how things are or even noticing my husband didn't have his food. I interrupted her conversation with my little guy to let her know things were ok but my husband wasn't happy with his salmon. She goes \"oh, well they normally only cook it medium rare\". So I ask well why did the other lady say it's medium? This chick just smiled at me and then started back talking to my son. The chef ends up bringing the salmon back out and apologized and it was to my husband's liking. While we were eating, another guy comes over to us with someone else's order asking if it was ours....i just shook my head and laughed. The service was ok. The place nice and trendy, reminded me of some east coast places i loved. Probably should've sat inside, outside was sooo noisy (but, i wasn't ok waiting when I'd already made reservations) This place is probably somewhere I'd come with girlfriends for happy hour or to have drinks and appetizers before going out but not family dinner again. The first server seemed busy and the second server..... This place is huge and I feel like with it being that big, the kitchen should be able to accommodate large crowds. There's no reason our food should have taken so long (and neither server came by with updates about the wait or to let us know it would be out soon) and I'm still trying to figure out why they kept taking food to wrong tables. We only came here because we wanted to check it out before the one in Gilbert opens.",

Other than the staff not having any resemblance of being employed there I think the place rocks. Good food but not cheap. The scenery makes up for the food prices.

If you want to play a game you forfeit the table you just waited 30 minutes for. It makes no sense that there is no reservation system in place to save your table while you play a game to wait for your food. Isn't that the entire concept of this business?",

Unfortunately the place was a super zoo for some reason... on a Tuesday night and we didn't get seated for another 20 minutes. The manager and the staff were super apologetic because of the wait. We love CD and have been to the Scottsdale and downtown locations.  I must say the service and attention to detail in light of the messed up reservation was well above my expectations. This location is truly the best of the local, in my opinion. Thank you Clancy for taking care of us. Kudos!",

The EATS: I had the black mussels (captured in photos) with spicy sausage. The plate portion was great but each individual mussels were small (not the fault of the restaurant, just want to be as descriptive as possible for the next guest). I felt the mussels where on the bland side.  DRANK DRANK: I really had fun with this experience. The Bartender gent was patient with my indecisiveness. He put me on to the Bee's Knees cocktail (also captured in photos). It was refreshing and crisp. He explained in detail was the recipe called for and it was a perfect suggestion. Just hoped he crafted the drink in front of me just to give that extra gusto (everyone loves presentation)!",

I was with a party of 6 and we ordered cocktails and asked for water. The drinks came within a reasonable amount of time, but it took 45 minutes (and several \"I'll be back with those waters\" from our server) to get any water at our table. You know the feeling when you try to desperately ask your server for something because you can tell you won't see them again for a while? That was our experience.  I ordered the Korean rib eye steak which was very tasty, but I don't think the portion on my plate was even a full 8oz of beef. Also, it was already cut? Part of the joy of ordering a steak is cutting it! Basically, it was served like fajitas... Not what I was expecting, I guess.  Maybe we were the unlucky table with the 1 not-so-good server, but it leaves an impression you know? Like bringing us our bills with not a SINGLE pen! Hello?! To top it all off, valet brought back my truck and there were blotches of some mysterious white substance on my windshield, my passenger window, and all over the bed. So bizarre!  I'm not a negative person, and it pains me to leave a negative review for a local AZ chain, but I feel let down.",

    "text": "Culinary Dropout used to be my favorite go-to destination in Tempe. I'm not saying the food is that great, it was more because of the personable and accommodating bar staff, great ambience, diversity of clientele, and live music on Friday and Saturday nights. However, on a recent visit, my husband and I experienced a rather unusual and disturbing encounter with Jason the General Manager that I won't soon forget. Call it corporate political-correctness run amok, but the way Jason tried to represent his other patrons at the expense of alienating two of his best was inexcusable. Jason was not rude, but let's just say he was a bit...snarky? smug? condescending? Jason came up to us from behind the bar and interrupted our conversation to explain that we were this night, or in the past, a bit too brash. I don't remember his exact words, but this was the gist. This is a bar, after all, and I thought it was typical for people to have loud and lively debates, but I digress. As I challenged him because he clearly did not have his facts straight, he refused to be specific, only saying that \"other people\" concurred. Humbly, I admit that my husband and I can get a little heated in our conversations, WITH EACH OTHER, and if Jason could have identified what either of us said that was rude or offensive, perhaps I would understand. During this berating session, I just looked at him completely bewildered because we had been there less than 30 minutes. Whatever his goal, Jason handled the situation very poorly. Would it not have been better for us to talk directly to the people we offended, if indeed we offended them?  Incidentally, since it's opening, we were in the habit of spending over $300 a week at this Fox restaurant alone. We have chosen to spend that money elsewhere.",

And just to add a little insult, we also received an email from Opentable stating that they had been notified by the restaurant that we were a no-show...  We had arrived just about 5 mins ahead of time. So not sure what that was all about....  So overall quite the disappointment  Update  5/7/2018  I received a quick response from the owners with an explanation. It`s good to see they really care. It seems like most of the reviews are very positive; so I hope our next visit will be as good as everyone else's.  The OpenTable issue must have been a mistake, and that was corrected.

Based on the reviews, there was no doubt that we had to make time to try this place out.   The restaurant is located at this huge industrial looking building. It has such a cool vibe!! Pretty sure I'd come here often if I lived nearby. Very large bar that spans across a wide space. Lots of seating. There is even a ton more outside, but we didn't even notice that until we left.   We compared the menu prices to Bay Area (CA) prices so I'm not sure that it's a fair comparison. But we were happy because a place like this would be so much more at home. We felt like we got a good value for the price  (though it was not inexpensive).   The food was amazing. I loved everything I had. There was a tiny miss on one thing but I can't even rememeber what it was. I just know that the flavors alone were good but they didnt make a good combination. Yet every other dish was wonderful.   I hope I can come back again and try more food while spending more time enjoying the establishment!",

    "text": "Only fun friends allowed! This is where you go if you want to share creative dishes for brunch or late night shenanigans, have drinks, play games, or just watch sports.   Culinary Dropout is at the forefront of the next wave of American restaurants, that cross between summer backyard bbq, drinking games with your friends, mixed in with a sports bar and maybe even a live band on some nights. Kinda hard to describe it, other than to say they have it all!  There's indoor seating and covered outdoor seating. There's a mural of Amy Winehouse, Freddie Mercury and Johnny Cash done up in Mr. Brainwash style. Ping pong tables, corn hole, foosball, shuffleboard.   Drinks:  Hijinx & Rye ($11 - Bulleit Rye, Blackberry, Jaime Torres Valencia Orange, Allspice Spritz) - Good if you like your rye with some berry fruitness. A good balance of sweet and fruity but not too too sweet and fruity.   Grub:  House Potato Chips w/ Onion Dip ($6) - Loved the housemade potato chips, they were the perfect thickness for dipping, lightly salted. The onion dip was a little on the creamier side. It would have been perfect if it had a little more onion kick.   Cap'n Crunch Crusted French Toast (Cereal Milk Custard, Fresh Blackberry) - Tasted great but it had the potential to be so much more. They ground up the Cap'n Crunch to powder form and then dip and coat the bread in it. It tasted like Cap'n Crunch but I think it could have been more bangin' if they sprinkled some Cap'n Crunch pieces on the top or if they imbedded some in the side of the bread before throwing it on the grill. If they didn't tell you it was Cap'n Crunch, you would not have been able to tell by just looking at it. It's dusted with powdered sugar and you get a few blackberries and syrup.   Fried Chicken ($16 - Honey Drizzle Buttermilk Biscuit, Coleslaw, Mashed Potatoes and Gravy) - Wow! The fried chicken here is all that!!! Well seasoned, light, flaky crust with juicy chicken on the inside. Cooked perfectly! They give you three large pieces (breast, drumstick, thigh) and I could barely finish it all. The biscuit was good also, the honey drizzle is more subtle than in your face sweet, but a nice touch vs. your standard biscuit. Coleslaw was alright, mashed potatoes were alright. Get this dish either for yourself or to share!  What do I need to try next time? The Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue and the Grilled Cheese Sliders.   They also have burgers, salads, mussels, oysters, charcuterie, cheese, ribs, fish & chips, monkey bread, sweet caramel custard and breakfast on the weekends along with other items.   I went to the Tempe location so that crowd skews a little younger being nearby ASU. The location is huge.  I really enjoyed the vibe here. If you're looking for food and fun at moderate prices, you'll need to check out one of their locations!",

A long hallway and looking down it seemed like the walk of shame hallway.  You get past that hallway and this place opens up!!!  its huge with many corn hole games, tennis tables, and a whole lot of seating.  This place is a bar with only appetizer food.  Do not expect to get a steak dinner or even a juicy cheeseburger.  Come here to really chill and hang out with beer, wine, or cocktails.  For me I go straight for the cocktails.  i think I ended up drinking 6 classic mules.  But no one was counting.  I played a round of corn hole and lost but who cares!  I had a drink in my hand!  Great spot.  Only reason I give this visit a 4 instead of a 5 is because I ordered my second mule and didnt get it until 15 min later and 3 reminders.  How'd I remember that?  I'm sure I'll be back.",

    "text": "First things first, I don't think I've ever been this impressed. From the second I walked into Culinary Dropout until the second I left, I was absolutely amazed. The atmosphere is so welcoming and cozy. The speed of service is excellent! Though I can't remember our server's name, I know this place only hires the best because that's what I had. Every employee that I came across while I was there seemed to definitely enjoy their job and they are really good at what they do. Not often can you find people in the service industry who absolutely love their job and do it so well.  I drank a few Papago Orange Blossom beers, but was ready to order right away. Our server gave me and my friend a few great suggestions. I, however, went with the Shaved Prime Rib Dip. Wow, it melted in my mouth. The au jus was so perfect, not too salty, and the meat in the sandwich was cooked past perfection (is that possible?)! I've always been a fan of beef sandwiches with au jus on the side, but never in my life have I tasted one so satisfying. I was genuinely amazed. I was feeling something on the healthier side of the food pyramid to go with my Prime Rib Dip, so I got a house salad with it. The lettuce was so fresh, and crisp, I seriously devoured the salad in seconds. The dressing on the salad was amazing as well, I might add! I like that the salad had cheese in it, as well as cucumbers, restaurants these days usually don't put the best ingredients in their house salads. For a price of $17, with an appetite like mine, this meal was a steal.  I can't remember what my best friend ordered, but let's just say we both left this place full, and more than satisfied. I know she also had a house salad, and we were amazed that we were seriously talking about this salad like it was prepared just for us. We probably talk about going back to Culinary Dropout three times a week, but we haven't been able to make it back yet.  Ever since the day we got to try this place we've been longing to go back. We are just a couple of college students with not a lot of money, so eating here regularly just isn't going to happen.  I can't wait for the day where I have money to blow, an appetite to satisfy and another great friend to show this amazing restaurant to. I was a little worried when we decided to try it, as I was convinced no place could live up to all the talk about how good it is. Many of my friends had told me how good this place is, but I had to try it myself. Culinary Dropout highly exceeded my expectations and like I mentioned before, I cannot wait to go back! Thank you for the awesome food, the best service, and a lovely atmosphere.",

She claimed it was all about restoring blood circulation but Tommy called it a deal breaker and dumped her then proceeded to cry for days.   Like good bros We banded together and lifted him out of the pit of despair with buckets of kilt lifter, cheesy pretzels and about 30 rounds of bags.  Ergo, This place is good when drunk or entertaining, the menu is mediocre but slightly above par for drunk food. Not many healthy options but I guess they dropped out of culinary school for a reason. Fun bar atmosphere for the bros.  Also there's hella hotties up in here but they all just trying to score free drinks and bounce or they're inexorably torn between the two roided douchebags with tribal tattoos that she came with. They're mostly leading dudes on while super interested in some loser kid that works at taco bell.",

    "text": "9/27/18 Yelp Review Culinary Dropout Tempe, AZ 149 S Farmer Ave, Tempe AZ 85281 1 (480) 240-1601  Since I first started attending ASU, my family and I have loved going to Culinary Dropout in Tempe. The food is incredible, the atmosphere and the ambiance is nothing like any place I have ever been to before, and the service is top of the line. The food is extremely delicious and priced very well for what you get. Big portions here are key; they do not want you leaving their establishment hungry. I have had many things on the menu, one of those things being the soft pretzel bites with provolone fondue. For only $12, you can get one of the best appetizers in Tempe. The turkey pastrami at a mere $13 is also extremely tasty. My favorite item on the menu has to be the fried chicken. I get it almost every time I go for a very reasonable price of $17. The crispy fried chicken is finished with a honey drizzle and served with coleslaw and your choice of mash potatoes or fries. I highly recommend the burgers as well, all priced well under $15 a piece. Although this place has many different reasons for people to visit, their food stands as the focal point of this establishment and is the main reason it is always so busy at Culinary Dropout.  Their atmosphere and ambiance is unlike any other restaurant I have been too. The place is huge, over 30,000 square feet and they utilize every inch of the property. They have a very large dining area that has live music Wednesday to Sunday, and their bar is also massive with an indoor and outdoor bar top. Outside, they have an area called the Yard, which is where you can take your drinks and go outside and enjoy fun games like corn hole, ping-pong, and even foosball. Culinary also has countless TV's inside and outside, as well as at the bar, so you can go anywhere throughout the entire restaurant and still being able to watch any game that is on at the time. Besides the restaurant, they also have multiple event rooms that are rented out by customers for corporate events, weddings, birthday parties, and much more. Sky is the limit for Culinary Dropout. They continuously crank out quality food and provide an excellent atmosphere for their customers, which is why everybody seems to keep coming back. The service at Culinary Dropout is pretty fast, but having a large restaurant and an upscale menu can lead to time constraints. The times I have been there we have had no problem getting a table or getting our food. They offer open seating throughout the week at bar top tables and outdoor lounge tables in case the wait gets a little bit too long. That is the one problem I think they have. The place is so popular and does so much business that sometimes the wait for a table can be a bit long. This is not their fault, but the fault of their popularity and the demand for their services. Overall, this place is everything you can ever want in a restaurant. Great food, quality atmosphere, and diligent service.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed in how downhill Culinary Dropout has gone.  The service staff is extremely chaotic and inconsistent.  We got our food and had to wait 10 minutes for them to bring any utensils.  We had someone in our party with a food allergy that was shared with the staff and her order could have put her in the hospital if she hasn't noticed the allergy they had still included in her order.  And to end the night off they incorrectly charged the bill to include a dish that was their mistake.  Would not recommend this place unless you like to be constantly disappointed in a meal and possibly be put in the hospital for an allergic reaction.",

    "text": "Only visited for lunch with business associates but we had a lovely meal both times.    The pretzels and provolone fondue appetizer are a MUST order.  The portion is huge, so definitely need to share.  It was so good, we ordered it again the next time we visited!    On our first visit, I had fried chicken and one of my companions had the trout.  The chicken was hot and tasty and the buttermilk biscuit was delicious, but the mashed potatoes were just OK.  My friend loved the trout so much she ordered it at our second outing!  I had the prime rib dip and fries on the second visit.  No fat on the beef and roll was nice, fries were good.  I enjoyed the sandwich, but the chicken was better.  Atmosphere is a bit loud at lunch but not unreasonable.  Seems to get crowded - we had a reservation our first visit (and had about a 5-10 min wait for noon on a Friday) and no reservation on the second visit (no wait, but it was a Wednesday).  I would guess it gets pretty loud evenings.  We ate in the main dining area, not the Yard.  Will visit again!",

The food was ok, nothing to really jump per the moon for and the price was not consistent with the taste... I had the fried chicken, it was cool, like I said nothing over the top in my opinion. Service was really spot on, the waiter came around often with suggestions about beer, cocktails and food. Nice open layout with the yard to play cornhole and a ton of TV's to catch games. I would come back, probably for college football.",

Then there are nice sofas around the room to sit and chat!  Now for the food! We started with an app. Had the pierogies. Awesome! I had the fried chicken, mashed potatoes and coleslaw. Chicken was very moist. You get three pieces and can choose white and/or dark meat. Hubby had the meatloaf, mashed potatoes and green beans. Yummy! Wish I lived near hear to explore menu.

    "text": "I don't care if these guys are culinary dropouts or not, they still know what they're doing!  Food: A pretty short menu but they have a little bit of everything. To start we had the Soft pretzels with provolone fondue. I'm not exaggerating when I say they have the BEST pretzels and cheese I've ever had since I've moved to AZ. We've tried Thirsty Lion's and AZ brewing Co. to name a couple but Culinary Dropouts wins. Not being biased in any way. It was just all around the best. SO ORDER THEM.  We also got the Roasted salmon and Rainbow Trout. I was shocked that this land-locked Arizonian restaurant had such great fish dishes. Very moist, flaky, no residual fishy taste. Flavors danced in my mouth. I want to say their fish is fresh not frozen bc of the texture, but can't be 100% sure.  For my beverage, the waiter suggested the Velvet Death, an absinthe drink, and it was yum.  Finished off with Apple Monkey bread and ice cream for dessert and it was heaven.   Prices: Appropriate but not out of this world   Atmosphere: Phenomenal. Culinary Dropout successfully pulls off the romantic or even family dining experience inside while also providing a social, drinking game area outside without it even being tacky. Creative lighting plays such a huge factor in interior decorating and ambiance and this place does it right. Just feels...idk...good. The indoor live music that night was enjoyable. The outdoor drinking patio/social games area is fantastic for groups and is a wonderful way to meet new people.   Service: Good.   You won't be disappointed.",

Then the food... We got the pretzel and fondue appetizer. My god. There's no words for it because it left me speechless. To die for!!! Then all of us ordered the fired chicken.. Again. Speechless. This restaurant is one of a kind, awesome for parties, and really good prices for the quality of food that is served. Maddison definitely deserves a raise, promotion, or definite recognition. I would say everyone needs to try this revolutionary restaurant. Congrats Culinary Dropout.. 10/10.   -Satisfied California Visitor",

I've gotten my appetizers after my entrees multiple times, the servers I've had are poorly versed in their menu and bar capabilities (not to mention often highly unusual and hard to notice since they're encouraged to dress like they would outside of work), and had overall unpleasant experiences. It's painfully obvious that they value aesthetics much more than service; there's no way I can get behind a restaurant like that.   I'm not a Fox restaurant hater - I've worked at one, been to many, enjoyed myself most of the time... But the way they treat their employees and their guests (at this location in particular) leaves a lot to be desired. This doesn't include the fact that Fox cheaply and lamely copies dishes over from other menus, making it almost impossible to have a unique and new experience by visiting other restaurants within the concept group. Culinary Dropout in Tempe has given me no reason to return.",

At the end of our meal, our waiter said he took my meal off the bill but it was very obviously still on the tab. I'm not sure why someone would say that and then not actually put in the effort to take it off the bill? He was probably one of the worst servers I've ever had.

Soft Pretzels with Fondue tastes reasonable good, though a little too plain. Fried chicken is pretty good, juicy and tasty, though still not something that can be rated as outstanding. I understand it's a place more for atmosphere, so definitely not a bad choice in Tempe, but the food is not worth the waiting time anyway.  It would be better if you want to have a party and play here of course.",

We got the pretzels for an appetizer and they were soft and fluffy little pillows that I absolutely adored. And I might have drank the cheese sauce it was so good. I got the kale salad and every bite was delicious. My husband also really liked his Italian sandwich, although it wouldn't have been my first choice. They were out of the beer I wanted, so I ordered another; and it was fine. Just a little annoying when they run out of their special beers on tap. But still, I had a great time.",

    "text": "Absolutely great! It is a bit loud but I did not mind personally. It is expected with so many people. I got the Perogies and my boyfriend got ribs, while we shared pretzel bites with fondue. We have leftovers for sure! The pretzel bites are several bites and quite large in all honesty, could be a meal because it is bread and cheese. The ribs were delicious. Very wet and love. The perogies were very good along with the califlower and brusselnsprouts that came. It was a small meal though. More of a appetizer than the bites. I was okay with it however. The lights, decorations and management were great. Everyone is very friendly and dressed stylishly. There are not only tables but couches to sit on instead on booths or tables. I am only 19 however the 21+ area looked very fun with ping pong and the game where you toss bags into holes (sorry I forgot the name.) reason for 5 stars is that I just never give them..... whoops",

I met a woman here for our first date and although it was very crowded (Wednesday) and we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, once we were seated, the other tables, the crowd, and even the live music on stage were not at all frustrating distractions; my date and I were able to talk and get to know one another in peace and comfort.   Management was very prompt and attentive when my glass of water accidentally shattered as our waitress was attempting to refill it. They even comped us dessert (Monkey Bread), which was delicious.",
