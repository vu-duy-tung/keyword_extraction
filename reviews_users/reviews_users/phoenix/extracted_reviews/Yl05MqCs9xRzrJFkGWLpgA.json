We got the mimosa flights, so good! And started out with the breakfast bruschetta (get It). Our server Lona is outstanding! So sweet and helpful. Everything about this place is great and will forsure be back!",

I had the lump crab sweet potato hash which was SO freakin delicious! Thinking about it right now is making my mouth water!!! My husband had pork Benedict and I ate half of that too! Yum!

Our favorite breakfast restaurant had a one-hour wait time on the Saturday morning of Memorial Weekend so we decided try The Hash instead. What a mistake!  They had a DJ who played really loud music. Annoyingly loud club music...and this is a breakfast restaurant. What's disconnect! So we asked to be seated outside where it was quieter. That's how the experience started. Bad omen! We ordered a frittata and a waffle. Both of which were very blend and completely lack taste. The service was lackluster.   On a good note, the food was served really warm and the tea was fantastic. But, with dozen of breakfast location choices around the area, it's not going to be enough to bring me back.",

However, the service left much to be desired. After waiting less than 10 minutes for a table we waited 15 minutes for a server to arrive. Another 10 minutes to get menus and waters, and another 10 before we were asked if we would like to order. Our waitress kept forgetting we were in her section and acted as if we were an inconvenience. Definitely will not be returning.",

She also said if you're trying to go on a weekend it's reservations only . The bloody bar was very good with plenty of quality  ingredients to choose from .  I ordered the breakfast burrito which was phenomenal and my fiance had  their pancakes with berries. She's a fan of sugar free syrup, but she had one taste of their homemade syrup and loved it. If you have children bringing them on a weekday would be easy , I probably wouldn't try it on a weekend though. All in all it's a very good place to eat and would definitely return.",

The wait was 45 minutes so we walked around the shopping center for a while.  The environment inside is LOUD. If we'd known how bad it would be, we probably wouldn't have gone. I've been at concerts that hurt my ears less, but the place was packed so we figured it would be good. When we were seated on the patio, we were placed next to some very loud and increasingly drunk individuals, which was a bit irritating. The wait staff seemed totally flustered-- several different people attended to us throughout the visit.  While the food was pretty good (and so were the drinks), the fact that we waited almost an hour for the food was ridiculous. We were \"placated\" by a random woman bringing over cannoli on the house, while apologizing for the wait. I think they did this for a lot of people. Ironically, our food arrived just as she left. We were also given drinks on the house as well.  Our server was okay, a little over the top with a Pauly D personality. I would have preferred if he'd just apologized sincerely for the wait instead of bringing out food and drinks we really didn't need.  Definitely won't go back. Too expensive, too loud, and too much of a wait.",

It's customizable with their house infused flavored vodkas, regular, medium, or hot tomato juice, and all the different add-ons (read: bacon, slim jims, stuffed olives, and ohemgee fried raviolis). The wait for a table is long, definitely not the 25 minutes we were promised, but their bloody mary definitely made it a little more tolerable.  To be honest, the wait, insane crowd, and mediocre service largely attributed to this average rating. People were cutting lines left and right, be it trying to get your name in to get a table, or getting yourself a bloody mary, customers often were oblivious or deliberately ignoring the lines the rest of us had formed and the wait staff did nothing to provide service to the people who had been patiently waiting in line. That in itself was my first disappointment.  At the table, I'll cut my waiter some slack since the restaurant was basically at the point of chaos. We got the huevos rancheros hash, which was delish, but the apple pie pancakes were just okay. It was a stack of four plain pancakes with apple pie fillings and crumbs on the top. However, the bottom three pancakes were pretty dry and I found my little cup of syrup empty in no time at all. I do really appreciate that our waiter noticed this and offered to bring more syrup, though unfortunately, I was basically done at this point.  All in all, decent experience but I'm in no hurry to stop by for a weekend brunch since the crowd is just off-putting.",

It was a cold and windy day in scottsdale and we waited 30-40 min for an outside table for just two people on a Saturday for brunch around 11ish. There's a live DJ inside. If you were hoping to talk to people inside, the music is pretty loud, so that probably won't happen. However, the bloody mary bar has the most toppings i've ever seen. The food was ok not fantastic but for how busy they were I was pretty surprised with how quickly it all came out. I think you definitely go here for the experience and people watching. Seems to be really popular for bachelorette parties as well.",

Was in Scottsdale for a tournament this past weekend and after playing and reffing kickball in the rain for 9 hours straight, let's just say my friends and I went hard Saturday night. We were pretty much dying for food Sunday morning. We didn't get out to this place til around 12 and we had to wait an hour before we could get seated.   There's indoor and outdoor seating, along with small tables and a huge bar. Right at the entrance, there's a Bloody Mary station where you can make your own Bloody Mary. The line for that was longggg.   It has a decent sized menu with SO MANY AMAZING THINGS to choose from. Everything sounded delicious, I really couldn't decide, but I went with the Lump Crab & Sweet Potato Hash. It was reallyyy good, but I thought it was going to be like corned beef hash with the lump crab and sweet potato on top. I was sortaaaa disappointed, but it was really good nonetheless.   Service was good for the most part. Our server was nice, but I could tell he was busy and we sort of just asked for all the things we needed at once because we weren't sure when we'd see him next. Prices are decent -- $12-16 but you get a HUGE amount. I definitely want to come back to try more things, but maybe come in earlier so we don't have to wait as long. Definitely worth checking out.",

    "text": "My husband and I enjoyed a pre-hike brunch at this spot during our recent vacation to Scottsdale. The decor is trendy and the music is moderately-loud but we didn't feel overwhelmingly so (though if you're looking for a quiet, intimate brunch experience, this may not be the place for you). Our waiter was friendly, attentive and visited often. The menu was expansive and included all the brunch classics. Although our waiter advised us the avocado toast was enough to feed both of us, we were indecisive and ultimately ended up ordering both the \"HK style\" avocado toast and the salmon eggs benedict. The Benedict was delicious, from the warm biscuit on the bottom to the light, fresh, and perfectly cooked salmon. Between the two of us, my husband and I easily polished this off. The Avocado Toast, which you can see by other user-submitted photos is nothing like normal avocado toast. It's huge, with fresh brioche that is delicious but slightly too thick, in our opinion. The bread is warm and soft, not toasted to give the satisfying crunch of a typical avocado toast, and while the pork and chili topping was delicious, the avocado was a bit lost beneath it. This may just be a matter of personal preference, since many other reviewers seemed to like it. It's definitely a meal for two people, so take that into account before you order. All the other food coming out of the kitchen looked great as well, as did the build your own Bloody Mary bar, and the place was busy with several parties waiting for tables around 10am on a weekday.  Overall, delicious food and great atmosphere. If we're back in town, we will return.",

My boyfriend and I both got a signature hash, the ham and carnitas and both were great. We also shared the breakfast bruschetta which was delicious. Would definitely come back!!",

The restaurant is one big room, very open and loud. There's not a lot of decor but the atmosphere is bright and lively.   I started with a Bloody Mary from the Bloody Mary bar. You get to choose your salt rim, vodka and mix flavors, in addition to like FORTY skewer options!   To eat I had the Oreo pancakes. The stack was massive and had good taste, but I thought they were a little dry and cakey.   Overall it was a really cool place but for such a crowded and expensive place I wasn't too impressed.",

We ordered the Benedict fries and they were good, but not that impressive. My friend ordered the shrimp salad, and I had the mesquite salmon salad. Yooooo I had no idea I was getting smoked salmon. There's a big difference. My salmon was jiggly squishy and while full of smoke flavor, was seriously disturbing. Her plate had like 6 shrimp on it. My salad had big slimy chunks of oranges with tomatoes and crumbly goat cheese (I think). Someone is high down there because those really all together just don't go! I did go to a breakfast/brunch spot and ordered a salad, so I digress...",

    "text": "(Lyrics - Weezer - Hash Pipe)  I can't help my hunger, I'll go out of my mind This kitchens got it going cause I like their breakfast I can't love my singing if I can't get a drink Down some Bloody Mary's at a bar that I make  Ohhh, come on and make me Ohhh, come on and make me Whoa...! Come on and make me Whoa...! You've got some olives Whoa...! I want some peppers Whoa...! You've got some big pours Right at the Hash Kitchen  A former seafood restaurant The Hash Kitchen is now a head on Breakfast/Brunch restaurant with some fun flares!  I came here after a hike; my friend had her pup so we requested to be sat outside on the patio.  Needless to say, they were happy to oblige....yah!  As we walked pass the restaurant the place was hoping; I'm not sure if it was because of the PHX Open, but there were a lot of patrons along with a live DJ.  One thing noticeable about this place is the round Bloody Mary Table -- it's a MIY Bloody Mary bar!    To start I ordered the French Press coffee with the Smoked Sliced Brisket & Corn Beef Hash.  Of course I had to do the Bloody Mary bar!  I selected the Siracha Bloody Mary with Vodka; stuffing it with celery, baby corn, carrots, peppercini peppers, jalapenos, olives, bacon, and beef jerky.  I couldn't stuff it anymore at some point cause I would have!  Needless to say, it was fun and yum at the same time.  Moreover, I got the entire canister of the French Press coffee!  My hash came with green peppers and a poached egg on top.  I thought it was pretty basic, but still good.  I wanted some texture hoping the hash would be somewhat crunchy.    In the end, I gave this place my best because the ambiance was popping and the service was impeccable!  The place catered to my friends pup and our server kept coming out to serve him water too!  We were constantly asked if we need more of this or that and our waters kept full!  We had one main server, but managers and bussers came to our attention without a hitch.  Definitely my new favorite spot for breakfast! - Enjoy!",

One hostess had a skirt on that I'm sure was made for a Barbie. Food was good but I wasn't like \"WOW\". Did I step into a restaurant or night club? Music was way to loud to enjoy a conversation without yelling at 10am, let alone hear the waitress! All I could hear were people at tables near me shouting because of the loud music. I sat and watched as a manager would only cater to large groups and not address tables of 4 or less. My waitress was nice but I could hardly hear her speak. She took our order, came by to see if all was well and then to hand over the check. I could've used another cup of coffee but I guess not. Overall.... meh! Idk if I'd make that drive again for an overpriced meal and a headache.",

The Bloody Mary bar was way beyond my expectations and kept the flow moving: it was kinda like watching kids in a candy store, all the adults were having a great time! It was a nice, refreshing atmosphere. Music playing in the background, but not so loud that you could barely have a conversation. The manager even greeted us, asking about our experience and wished us well. It was overall a great experience and I look forward to coming back here time and time again.",

She kept checking in on us and making sure that we were ok while we waited and some of us sat at the bar until a bigger table was ready. The red grapefruit mimosas were SO good!

The pancakes were super fluffy and with the apple and pie crush paired with ice cream was soooooo freaking good.  The crab roll was superb.

The Benedict was very good, but could have used a little something more to top it (aside from the usual). The crispy potatoes/hash were also good. The roll was tasty and it was served as 2 rolls - perfect for sharing. The fries were perfectly crisp yet tender and nicely salted.   On another occasion tried the pancake flight- yum!! A variety of sweet treats, also great to share with a dining companion.   The indoor dining is a bit loud for my taste (trying a bit too hard in my opinion with a DJ and all), however we always enjoy our time on the patio.",

Not too bad for brunch on a Saturday.   My coffee glass had lipstick on it and a water glass had a smeared berry on it. The water wasn't great tasting either..but who goes to brunch to drink water lol   I got the mimosa flight. The flavors of the day were pineapple, blueberry, strawberry and orange. Blueberry and pineapple are my absolute favorites!   Food- We tried several things. Chilaquiles  with an over medium egg. Delicious! Only thing is the green chili sauce was a little cold. Other than that it was a good dish. Carne Assad's Tostada. That was hella bomb!! Very flavorful.   Must Try: If you love coconut and French toast, try this...Coconut Almond Encrusted French Toast! It was my ABSOLUTE favorite!! Thick french toast with coconut in every bite, topped with fresh bananas. Super Yummy!!",

My most recent visit, I ordered the Herb Fried Chicken.  It was exactly what I wanted! The chicken was great, the potatoes were good, and I opted for a fried egg instead of poached, which was the perfect topper.   When visiting Hash Kitchen on a weekend, expect to wait a decent amount of time before getting a table.  I don't want to be \"that guy\" who complains about the music being to loud, but its pretty loud and hard to have a conversation with the people at your own table..",

Spinning pretty good beats too.   That being said, the food was bland and warm and the drinks were overpriced.   Pros? Bloody mary bar is huge Cool environment  Good music  Cons? I didn't realize the end of the Bloody Mary bar has the hot stuff in tubs (like meat balls!) so I missed that! Had our server been more helpful when I told him I wasn't super hungry, I'd totally have just done what half the people in the place were doing and had a couple Bloody Mary's piled high with food! Had the server not come by a couple times quickly asking our order, I'd also have observed that was the go to on my own! The food was super super super super... super... bland. Like, no flavor. The biscuits and gravy tasted like hot dogs with milk. The huevos was basically hard tortillas with stale onions and canned black beans....",

    "text": "True let down. I was excited to brunch at Hash with my friends on a Sunday and it was the worst decision possible.  The service and the food was subpar.  The only good thing about our brunch was the music. There is a Bloody Mary bar located directly across the entrance which may be the worst location. It truly congests the area making minimal room space around when its busy.  The counter where you put your name in was unorganized and they said they didn't take reservations... but it seemed like some people were allowed 'reservations'... To not help the situation, we waited much longer than they had anticipated for us - almost double.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich with fries and the one thing I was looking forward to (since we were waiting for close to 2 hrs) came out COLD! This sandwich has a lot going on, maybe too much for a breakfast meal. Made with bacon & onion jam, piled high smoked ham, avocado, 2 fried eggs, pepper jack cheese on brioche texas toast.  I really tried to enjoy but I just couldn't.",

There was a small snafu with the order in the French toast didn't arrive for quite a while and they graciously comped for us. I would go back there every day if I could.

She was very nice and went back to ask the kitchen to make me a full order with just the bacon and Brie, which was very nice. Then they brought it out and it was just some sad bacon on bread without Brie... this was probably a one off experience. I won't come back but I won't deter others. Just clarify your order... a few times.  Hi Joe",

The menu is EXTENSIVE and there is a bit of everything for everyone, which I really appreciated.   We got the cannoli donuts, herb fried chicken hash, and smoked salmon eggs benedict. The cannoli donuts came out warm and so tasty!! Seriously the best way to start out our breakfast. The chicken hash came came in a large serving size with a side of biscuit and man... I DEVOURED it. The fried chicken was cooked well and the poached eggs were done perfectly! The smoked salmon's poached eggs were perfect and the hollandaise sauce completed the dish.  Around 10 am, a live DJ came and played some tunes. There is also a bloody mary bar which seems to be a staple here. Our server was attentive and our overall experience was wonderful! I'd definitely come back here again.",

While sitting and looking over the menu I saw the one thing that drives me crazy. A dirty cloth is being used to \"clean\" tables. Omg. Please stop this. It's disgusting. The floors were dirty and had liquid stains all over. The bathroom was nice except no paper towels. Service was ok. A bit slow for a place that seemed not busy. The food was ok.

The service was friendly but the feel of the place was corporate or chain. That didn't stop people from packing into it and waiting in line to get in, but this place isn't worth all that.

There was a bit of a wait, but it wasn't bad. Maybe 10 minutes. We ordered the Bloody Mary bar right away. It was fun to add all the extra goodies in there. There were lots of pickled vegetables, bacon, olives, and even meatballs and fried ravioli. The actual drink was very good too.  Then we ordered the Hash Monkey for a starter. It was soooo yummy. Buttery and gooyey and sweet and warm.   We were sort of full-ish due to all the extras in our Bloody Marys, so we decided to share an entree. We asked our server for some recommendations and he said he always orders the Carnitas Hash. It was one of the items we were eyeing so we decided to get that. Oh my goodness. It was delicious! The carnitas were so tender and flavorful, the green chili sauce was amazing! I love a good green chili sauce and Hash does it right! The avocados, the cojita, I mean, it was perfect.   We then decided we had to have a mimosa too and we each chose a different one. They were equally divine. If I'm ever back in Scottsdale, this place is on the list to go back to.",

They have all kinds of mimosas- and you can get a tasting flight to try them all. If you're not wanting to inbibe, their coffee is fantastic. I suggest getting the French press coffee.  It was a tough choice but I went with the herb fried chicken skillet. The chicken isn't overly breaded but is thin and crispy. It's served with fried leeks- like onion straws. This is served on top of potato hash and drizzled with a hint maple syrup. Usually it's topped with poached eggs. I got my eggs on the side, eggs in general are not my favorite. But if you like eggs, the salty sweet combo isn't heavy but is crispy and delicious.",

Great ambience- bigger size than a lot of other local brunch spots that can get stuffy and overcrowded at busy rush times. The Bloody Mary bar has so many options for toppings, a bit intimidating for a first timer but the staff was very friendly and helpful. It turns out I'm an excellent Bloody Mary designer :) the food was delicious- we had the smoked salmon Benedict, Mexican chorizo omelet, biscuits and gravy and the breakfast burrito at our table- everything was very tasty! The biscuits were sweet, buttery and flakey. I can't wait to go back and try the lump crab Benedict next! Its also nice that they have TVs with the games on so the boys don't rush us home :)",

It apparently used to be Cuttlefish, but the inside was very modern with white marble and the staff was very friendly.  My lady and I sat at the bar and was pleased to see there was a DJ there (keep in mind this was at 11am in the morning).  The DJ created a very nice atmosphere and again I was just surprised there was no insane wait for brunch like I feel like all of Scottsdale always is.  The bartender was very friendly and was outgoing and struck up a conversation with us throughout the whole meal.  I got the Chicken & Waffles which were fantastic.  They were topped with fried leeks.  My girlfriend got the chicken hash which was absolutely fantastic.  I think first off the think you'll notice is that they use boneless chicken which makes for the perfect chicken-to-waffle ratio.  Also they make in-house biscuits which are  delicious!  Selfishly I hope they don't get TOO big b/c I don't want to have to wait for great food, but I guess it's hard to keep a lid on something this great!  Definitely wanting to try again!  Cheers!",

Free mimosas while you wait is awesome.  We decided to grab bar seats after 45 minutes but a prissy bartender told us she was holding them for someone else.  Hmmmm.  So it's not open seating at the bar I guess.  I mentioned this to the owner, an incredibly hard working, entrepreneur woman and she sat us immediately at a table.  Kudos to mom for her prompt recognition of her employees error.  Good times and good food.  No thanks to a bartender who thinks she controls the bar seats.  You just cost Hash a 5 star review.",

There were 7 empty tables on the patio during our 25 minute wait, and we said we WANTED an outside table.  She claimed they were for reservations, but in the 25 minutes, no one ever came and she ended up seating us at the empty table we stared at the whole time.  Then the waitress was completely unfriendly once she heard us say we did not want a breakfast cocktail.  She literally just walked away, said nothing and came back with water.  We asked questions about the menu and she shrugged and gave one word answers.  When we did a build your own option she was annoyed with the brief debate over which ingredients.  The food did come fast and the biscuits are delicious.  The food was good, but the poor service convinced me there are enough other breakfast spots to go with good service!",

    "text": "Maybe everyone that wrote a five star review had a great experience, or maybe they just buy into the pretentious Scottsdale BS that this place has down to a science. I get that they took a high-end restaurant and turned it into a brunch spot but honestly the decor prices DJ the whole scene was totally over-the-top and they seem much more concerned about appearances then actual quality of service and food.  What's right: - Great Diverse Menu  - Great Drinks - Awesome Bloody Mary Bar - Clean  What's wrong: - Overpriced- we each had one drink and an entree and the bill was $90 for 4 people. For BREAKFAST - Awful staff - the manager is a total ass. I saw him yell at staff in a completely derogatory and condescending manner multiple times. He did literally nothing except try to look important when clearly his staff needs coaching on service. And the hostess had on booty jorts and a 2.99 tank top from forever 21. Not knocking that outfit in general but it seems kind of tacky considering the image they're trying to portray. Plus the gross manager was all brushing up on her. - No specials - not everyplace has to have unlimited mimosas but some sort of deal would be nice, like 2 for ten or something  - THE FREAKIN HASH! - i'm going to go out on a limb here but if you're going to put the word hash into the name of your business your hash should probably be pretty decent right? I ordered a hash with fresh lump crab on it and was pretty excited to try it. Unfortunately the sweet potatoes in the hash were completely undercooked and disgusting. So I sent back the hash and it came back out with cooked yet flavorless potatoes but now there is no egg on it. So by the time I got my food everyone was done eating and finally I got my complete meal about 40 minutes after I ordered. My sister ordered another hash with regular potatoes and was equally unimpressed. You just need to do something special if you're going to base your menu around something.  And the cardinal sin of all breakfast places as well as number one indicator a breakfast place will go out of business..... Drumroll please... They did not keep our coffee cups full. Each of us had coffee and it was only refilled one time and that was after sitting empty for at least 10 minutes. The server brought the check and never asked if we wanted more but we did so we asked for more which turned out to be a good idea because we waited about another 15 minutes for our credit card to be run.   I give points for the menus creativity but the execution is bad and the service worse. I give this place 2 stars and 6 months!",

The poached eggs were too well done, the cornbread hash was dry and too sweet.

We were just looking to have a casual brunch and the food and service totally made up for the ambiance. I can't turn down a good bloody mary bar, so I started with that and my husband had the Prosecco smash. The bloody mary bar is one of the best, there's a ton of options starting with different flavored vodkas from cilantro lime to bacon, flavored salt, pickled veggies galore, fried ravioli and even oysters! Since a bloody mary is pretty much a meal in a glass I chose the quinoa and couscous salad which was a perfect accompaniment. My husband went the other route and ordered the breakfast lasagna which was to die for! Our server was fantastic and very attentive, the bloody mary bar was amazing, and the food was delicious, all factors that make up for the super loud DJ. I would definitely return!",

I ordered the smoked sliced brisket cornbread hash, with green chile. It was delicious! We also tried the chicken and waffles. The the texture and flavor of the chicken was perfect. For dessert we had sugar and cinnamon covered doughnuts (foreplay doughnuts) Sooo good  Didn't try the Bloody Mary's this time but the bar was legit and everyone who had one in hand seemed to be enjoying it.   Customer service was AWESOME! Everyone from the greeter to our server  was so genuine and welcoming.  I am definitely a fan of Hash Kitchen and will be coming back.",

    "text": "WOW!  I've been wanting to check this place out, as many friends have given glowing recommendations about it.  Today was the day.  First I should say that we hit The Hash Kitchen around 10:00 a.m. on a Wednesday.  There was no wait, yet the restaurant was bustling with patrons, servers and other staff.  What struck me from the beginning was the wide open space.  Tables nicely spaced, set with cutlery and nice cotton napkins.  Great acoustics, too.  A conversation can be had and heard.  Our waiter, Gino, stepped in prompty, exuding his friendly mannerisms and immediately made us feel like a member of the family.  It was obvious that he would accomidate any request or change of established order.  It came across as if it was his life's mission to make sure we had everything we needed.  A rarity in today's ever impersonal society.  Our order came very quickly.  It was hot and appealing to the eye. I had the Lump Crab Eggs Benedict and it was seasoned perfectly.  I had not experienced crab with hollandaise sauce before...it may be in my dreams from now on.  Mom had classic Eggs Benedict, with special requests.  There was not the blink of an eye as it was served.  She ate well and seemed to enjoy each bite.  She was a little miffed that I didn't order her a Bloody Mary instead of the hot tea that is her normal morning beverage.  A mistake I won't make again.  When ordering, I was offered fresh O.J., a mimosa or a bloody mary.  This surprised me, as they are normally brunch type drinks. How wonderful to be able to have a brunch kind-of-meal 7 days a week.  This place rivals some of the best in the Valley for ambiance, cleanliness, generous portions, truly personal service and prices that will not break the bank.  It's a winner!  Many thank to the hostess, Aimee, for her smile, sense of humor and the menu to take home.  We will most definately be back/",

Hash Kitchen has a super diverse menu that I haven't seen before with menu items like Banana Split French Toast (delicious!) and Fruity Pebble Pancakes. The fresh coffee is really good too. Lona was our server and she took super good care of us and made sure our experience was outstanding. So glad to have a new place for brunch!",

Plus, this one is near our home and the reviews said that they are dog friendly so there are a lot of reasons for us to frequent it.   Admittedly, we got there in the last hour before they were closing. The hostess was terrific and friendly and we opted to sit at the bar. The menu has a lot of great options. My husband ordered a beer which apparently they didn't have on tap. They told him that he could go over next door and get one (they must also own that space) but since we were seated, he didn't really want to walk to the other bar to retrieve his beer.   The food was okay. It was good but there were cleaning up around us like crazy. My water glass never got refilled. I get it - they wanted to go home but if they want it that bad, they should change their hours.   They do have a nice space and a good looking bloody mary bar. We may give it another try some time in the future.",

My daughter had the watermelon lemonade and it was not only delicious, but possibly the prettiest drink I have ever seen.  She also ordered the \"child's waffles with bacon \"-I kid you not, it would've been enough for all four of us, there's no difference in portion size for kids.  My husband had one of the hash dishes, ate half of it, my son had two eggs and waffles, and I had the scrambled eggs with sundries tomatoes, goat cheese and basil-yummy. I only ate the eggs, never got to the potatoes or biscuit.  Except the wait, great dining experience, but a place you would only do once or twice.",

They brought out the incorrect dish for my friend but immediately resolved it by being remorseful , offering to remake it, and brought out some additional items to make up for it! We appreciated that!!!   The lovely lady that is hosting is absolutely a hoot! She was so friendly and funny and kept checking on us!! She was great and shared many stories and photos! I'll go back just to chat with her!   The staff came and sang me happy birthday and brought a delicious fresh donut for me as a birthday treat!!   The drinks were great! And the Bloody Mary bar is a sight to see!! The place was packed and that's always a great sign!! So excited for our return trip to The Hash!! Best breakfast experience in AZ by far!   Thank you The Hash!!!",

Of the 10 tables being served while we were in there, all 10 had issue with their food, the lengthy wait or the lack of service from the staff. What a complete and total disappointment.",

We were greeted with smiles and hellos instantly.  We choose to sit inside out of the heat.  Then the ladies orderd flights of flavored mirmosas and we orderd bloody mary's.  They had an entire buffet table of condiments to choose from to add to your bloody.  Im not even going to attempt to describe the 60+ things you could add to your bloody.  What I will say is what an amazing concept.   For our food I had the Huevos Rancheros with carna asada hash.  My wife had the bannana split french toast with fresh fruit and whipped cream.  Oh my word was this an out of body experience.   The resturant is clean, the employees are friendly, the food is to die for, the handcrafted drinks and homemade vodkas make the bar an exciting...... What more could you ask for!  This place needs to be a stop for any family if traveling through Scottsdale area.  You and the kids will not be dissapointed I can guarantee. Words of wisdom.....  the owner is from Ohio and a big sports fan, so dont talk bad about Lebron James or any of Ohio's sports teams.  Lol",

I have been here 3 times, twice for the chicken and waffles (which really are amazing!) and most recently for the chicken verde. The latter was a bit of a disappointment- soggy chips and way too much verde sauce...I should've known to stick with what I knew. My boyfriend has gotten a few of the hash entrees and none were anything to write home about. Atmosphere is...confusing. Don't get me wrong I am all for trendy and upbeat, but IMO it's kinda weird to have a DJ blasting in the middle of breakfast. In south Scottsdale/old town they get away with it being that it's a BAR scene, but that's not at all the vibe up here. Service was okay, they were swamped every time I went so slow service was expected- just don't expect to be in/out!",

Their mimosas are pretty good however. The food here was average and I expected better. Tried their huevos hash which was blah and I didn't finish it as well as their lump crab benedict. The crab was excellent, but the portion was tiny. The rest of the benedict was very dry because they use dry biscuits for the base of the benedict. Their pancakes were just average, IHop is better honestly for pancakes. The second time I came here during the middle of brunch it turned into a club and they were blaring Spice Girls and other jams, which hey I love the Spice Girls, but you could barely have a conversation because it was so loud.",

More items that you could possibly add to one glass but lots of variety in both the rim salt, infused vodkas and toppings!  We started with these yummy fresh baked little donut holes that were on a bed of Nutella AND served with a syringe full of Nutella to inject into each of the donut holes...OMG!  We ended up splitting one of the THK Hashes and which was more than enough to share.  Great place, great service, great people and great food!  Definitely going back to try more!",

As a newcomer to the area, I wandered in just to see what it was about.... the staff was exceptional in greeting me, encouraging me to try it ~ guaranteeing I would like it better than Panera.  They convinced me, they did not pressure me.  It was everything they claimed and more.  Healthy, fresh, warm, made to order with out complaint for any substitutions, aimed to please and then some. I have told others to check it out. When I wanted to go again this weekend, the line was out the door!  Service, atmosphere, fresh & healthy choices, value - priced eating out is what i look for. Family owned is even better... and they meet all of this.  #Iwillbebacksoon!",

To give an example, their corned beef hash was made of cubes of brisket.  You can't cut adequately cooked corned beef into perfect cubes because the meat will be too soft.  The only reason they can do this is because the brisket was under cooked leaving the connective tissue in the meat intact and the corned beef still rubbery.  If they didn't know how to prepare it properly, they were better off just using the stuff that comes in a can.",

We were greeted right away and treated to a cozy table where we marveled at the menu options. We were pleased to hear that another location was opening soon in Chandler. Our server Natalie was quick and efficient and made sure we had what we needed. My friend thought her biscuits and gravy was divine, but the sausage was a bit spicy and intimidating so she asked to \"trade up\" for some more of that delicious gravy. Natalie made sure to bring a generous helping of gravy right away and we were truly happy! My smoked salmon benedict and side of potatoes were really good too! Only gave four stars because I would have liked to hear more about the advertised \"Arizona's Largest Bloody Mary bar\" & when I ordered, and I wasn't given the top shelf option either. Overall the experience was pleasant and we will definitely be trying the Chandler location as soon as it opens.",

Waited 22 minutes for our drink order to be taken. 1 bartender was working two bars and outdoor tables. Got drinks about 10 minutes later. Still no table. Decided to order food at bar. Picture attached of the most horrific pastrami sandwich ever. Fatty un edible bacon they said was pastrami covered In about a 2 inch layer of Mayo. Nothing at all as they have advertised on Instagram (top pic) Bread was a half frozen Texas toast. $59 for two bloody Marys and the worst meal and service ever.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try hash kitchen for quite some time now after having read all of the fantastic yelp reviews. Today I finally got my chance, and I was not disappointed. Absolutely everything was fantastic. The drinks, the food, the DJ, the hostess, the server... you name it, hash kitchen outdid themselves and I am so full I can hardly move. But I can't wait to have my leftovers!!  This place was packed even at 11 on a Sunday and I had to wait about a half an hour to be seated in the restaurant at a regular table. There was no lack of entertainment or drinks while I waited though. there isn't a huge waiting area and probably not the best place for kids, IMHO, although there was one party that had 2 children there but left shortly after we were seated around 11:30. No other children were there that I saw that day.  Since it was both my friend and I's first time there, we asked our server about a few items on the menu. He recommended some great choices and was careful to tell us which items were overly large.  He also told us that we could order half-orders of both the pancakes and the French toast, which we both did. Even the half-orders of these were huge. We both ordered Mimosa flights and I ordered one of the signature cereal drinks as well. The Bloody Mary bar looked amazing too, but just wasn't in the mood for it that day. Drink service was a tiny bit slow, it took awhile to receive our first round of mimosas, and one of the Mimosa's was Kiwi instead of Strawberry like it said on the board, but the kiwi was fantastic! Worth every bit of the wait. Alex, our server, was super fun and spot-on with his recommendations.  The breakfast lasagna; out of this world. Never had anything like it and can't wait to have it the next time I go.  I wish they did a sampler flight of the breakfast cereal drinks (hint, hint!!) because the Fruity Pebbles was amaze-balls. But would love still to try the other two (I think Cocoa Puffs and Cinnamon Toast Crunch). Next time!!",

The Host was a stuck up brat.  Their attitude is very much \"we don't have to be nice,  we are busy and don't need your business.\"  Eventually,  you will regret that snotty @ss attitude.   We were going to stay and requested to sit outside because weather was nice and we wanted to be able to HEAR each other because we LIKE each other and enjoy chit chatting without losing our voices.  I get the loud music during happy hour on a Friday night but this just made the restaurant look like it was trying too hard to be something cutting edge.  LAME. Anywho, we left before getting seated.  The patio looked crazy jammed with no breathing room.  We went to SOL Mexican Cocina for their brunch and it was amazing!!!!",

I've been here on multiple occasions -- in fact it's where I take all my friends/family that visit from out of town to -- the food has yet to disappoint. They even change the menu up seasonally to give us other yummy options.  3. The Bloody Mary bar is too legit to quit. One time (picture not included) I had the yummiest hush puppies ever!!   Overall great food - great service!!! You can't go wrong here!!!

And trust me, i know bloody Mary's. Years of experience speaking here...  Their Bloody Mary bar has such variety and the items were absolutely stop notch. I loved the bacon, The beef jerky, the oyster on the half shell... I can go on and on. I assume their sister restaurant is next door, Hoggs and Hopps. Cuz the smoked meats and the bacon were absolutely delicious.   They had a DJ during brunch on Sunday, who wrapped up around 1pm.  We got the nutella donuts, I got the herb chicken hash and hubs got the pulled pork waffles. I am sad to say, while good, the meals itself was not very flavorful.   The service was great except out waitress seemed to forget a lot of our requests and was a bit lack luster. But she was very sweet.  Next time I will just have two bloody Mary's and be a very happy bruncher :) I highly recommend you try this!",

There were a lot of people waiting outside (we came around 10:20am on a Sunday) yet our wait was about 30 minutes for an inside table. They had someone blasting music yet it wasn't loud to where you couldn't have a conversation with the people at your table. There was a mix of age groups there as well as families with kids. Our waiter was amazing and incredibly friendly. I ordered the $16 mimosa flight where they choose the flavors to bring you. That day it was passion fruit, raspberry, cherry and mango. I let the waiter know I was allergic to mango and he kindly swapped it out for an orange mimosa. I ordered the Fruity Pebble pancakes and 2 pancakes were more than enough for me (full stack is 4). My friend got a huevo ranchero hash and it was pretty big. He said he enjoyed it yet wouldn't order it again because he wants to try one of the burritos. They have a Bloody Mary bar where people were coming and going to make their drinks and add things like bacon to it. I checked in on Yelp and received a discount. I'd definitely go to this place again when I come back to Phoenix!",

Once again we had a first rate experience at Hash Kitchen.  We usually go during the week, but we broke our rule and tried on a Saturday morning.  The restaurant was very busy, but we were once again greeted by the incomparable Bonnie who took time to greet us as she always does even though the dining areas inside and out were jammed with happy diners.  We noticed that everyone was greeted and welcomed with warmth and friendliness.  Our server, Gino, was very friendly and cooperative-even making a change in my order to satisfy my craving. The menu has some new items, in particular the Benedict Fries.  They are fabulous.  New to me were the delicious meatballs and fried ravioli offered at the Build Your Own Bloody Mary Bar.  They take your custom drink to the next level. We also want to recognize the lovely Tiana who has served us on a number of occasions and is always attentive and competent. Looking forward to bringing out of town guests to experience a fun and delicious Scottsdale dining experience unlike any other at Hash Kitchen.",

My meal was just ok, overall I found the food lacked overall flavor, and the fried chicken eggs Benedict had super dry biscuits and the fried leeks on top were over kill. Nothing a little water couldn't fix. Next time I am in Scottsdale would love to stop by for a bloody, but would probably skip breakfast. Enjoyed the overall atmosphere mainly since I was on the far side of the restaurant away from the DJ's loud speaker. Service was good.",

Saying it very loudly so everyone else waiting would hear. It was so rude and uncomfortable! Why didnt he just tell us that on the phone when we first called that it was first come first serve? We would have waited. Upon sitting down the entire meal took 2 hours!!! It took forever to get our food and only half of it came. The food was so-so and over expensive mimosas. The water smells like fish..... go ahead smell the water before you sip. You'll understand what I mean. Absolutely disgusting place, I have no idea why it has such high reviews.",

We arrived early, which was a smart move, because the literal party had not yet started.  We were sat at a booth near the Bloody Mary Bar and immediately received a waiter.  He couldn't have been nicer, and provided to go coffee after asking if he could.  We also noticed the actual bar on the other side of the restaurant, with a DJ playing music.  When you reach a certain age, you have to party on Sunday morning, and I am at that age.  I mentioned the Bloody Mary Bar.  If you stumbled on one of the various print and internet publications claiming Hash to have among the best bloodys in town you need to know that is 100% True.  The $12 Bar is a step up from the basic $9 bloody into a world of limitless access.  Celery, carrots, pickles, cheese, slim Jim's, bacon, meatballs, pickled everything, olives of all variety all at your disposal. Load these snacks on top of the infused vodka bloody for a top notch drink.  While that may be a meal in itself, we also ate.  And there was much rejoicing.  My wife had the fried chicken Benedict which was a whole fried breast of chicken and 2 muffins.  I think she liked it, but adored the Bloody Mary.  I went with the s'mores French toast and I was served 2 pieces of bread that made up a half loaf.  Best breakfast I've had in a long time.  No complaints, except for the expanding stomach.  You can't go wrong here.  Just come early.",

I was initially really excited to try this place as I come from Texas and we don't have a place like this there. I ordered the Herb Fried Chicken and Waffles with Hash potatoes and they are definitely not what I expected. The potatoes were extremely bland and very unappetizing, and I didn't eat very many because of that. The chicken for the chicken and waffles were really bland as well and overall, unappetizing. I am one to eat all of my food but I couldn't eat all of it because I just didn't enjoy it. The 3 stars come from the waitstaff and the overall set-up of the restaurant , but I definitely will not come back if I come visit Arizona again",

My fried chicken was hard, cold and quite frankly tasted old. It was a fried chicken strip on top of the hash. The hash was fried potatoes on the bottom and lacked flavor and seasonings. The poached egg was the favorite part of the dish. My friends poutine looked delicious and he enjoyed his meal. I don't know if I'd come back again I mean who messes up fried chicken? My meal was dry, lacked flavor and was meh.",

There is going to be a long wait on weekends and they don't take reservations but seating at the bar is first come first serve if you have a small party.   Mimosas come by the flight and they are known to have the biggest Bloody Mary bar.   This is the first place I have ever seen a bacon board as an appetizer and it was amazing!   When I have gone here on the weekends there is usually a DJ and I've seen 2-3 bachelorette parties... great food and great vibes!",

SERVICE-the hostess was super friendly and our server was amazing! I forgot to get her name but I wish I knew! She was very attentive!  CARNITA HASH- it was delicious! It had a lot of flavor! They forgot to put avocados in mine so I informed them and they fixed it right away! The pulled pork was tender and the potatoes went well with the pulled pork. The biscuit that came on the side was bomb. It had sugar on the surface of the biscuit which made it sweet and savory. It wasnt too heavy which I thought was awesome.  This place had a DJ on weekends and the DJ that was there was pretty damn awesome! Its definitely a young crowd so if you dont like loud music, then this place isnt for you. I would definitely be back when Im in town!",

The Bloody Mary bar is phenomenal and the Mimosa flight will leave you craving for more. Whether you're looking for a meal that's sweet or savory,  #hash has you covered. Some of my favorites are the avocado toast, cannoli pancakes and banana split brioche.  If you are brave enough,  get the adult Capri Sun #drinkresponsibly. The manager Gino understands the True meaning of customer service.  We were welcomed by the owner and Gino. They made us feel welcomed. Lastly, our waitress Asha was absolutely fantastic.  Attentive, helpful and accommodating.  She had the best personality and provided top notch customer service.  Thank you for making my breakfast experience great! See you soon.",

Now, we expected it (and got some drinks to tide us over, so that wasn't awful, but I expected so much more once we got sat.  Our server, while nice, seemed to consistently forget that she had our table. Took about 10 minutes for her initial visit and kept forgetting to bring things we asked for. Our food took forever to come out and was not all correct. Lastly, there was apparently an issue with the computer system at the bar, which causes them to go into full lock down mode for some reason..as though they couldn't figure out an analog way to keep track of orders. So, not only did we not ever get our drinks, but our server had completely forgotten that we even ordered any!  I truly hope this was a fluke and that they just had a bad day and were seating more people than they could handle, but it definitely left a bad taste in my mouth for this location and makes me not want to come back.",

    "text": "This place is the bomb-shiz-nizzle-snap-diggity. No but seriously, if you are reading this you should already be getting into you car. Here is a list of 5 tips:   1. No reservstions. Dont be a premadona, you will wait 30 minutes for a table. Use it as your oppurtunity to start with the mimosa flight for your wait.   2. If you come after 10 am on sat and sund the DJ spins fire .. like old school hip hop Onyx Slam, TLC Waterfalls, En Vogue Free Your Mind fire. If this is your chosen adventure add 15 min to your wait time (see 1 above).    3. Christina corn cakes benedict: a sweet and hearty mixture of love wrapped in a corn husk.   3. The pimp goblet mimosa....so how else would you refer to AN ENTIRE bottle of champagne, fresh squeezed OJ, 2 huge neon straws, a pin wheel, garnished with chili dusted cotton candy?   4. If you like benedicts.....aside from the Christina corn cakes, the Pretzel Benedict is like Thanksgiving at the movie theater assuming you love crunchy onion strings on your green bean casserole and a soft pretzel with cheese at the movie theater.    5. The serial shooter flight, for the stoner in you that has graduated to becoming an alcoholic.",

We were headed to a different one. I had the Veggie frittata w/ goat cheese.  Yum!  And so much that I shared some with my husband and have enough left for my breakfast tomorrow. Hubby went for the traditional corned beef hash and said it was great-he finished the proteins (corned beef and two eggs) and took his potatoes home for breakfast as well. Our waitress was fun, knowledgeable and helpful. Loved the coffee cups!  Perfect size for this coffee fanatic!",

We started with the bruschetta board which was fine. Then husband preceded to order the avocado toast and I ordered the breakfast burrito. The food came out quickly, much more quickly than I expected, and we quickly figured out why. The bacon on my husband's avocado toast was completely uncooked, it was white! None of the fat had been rendered down. We asked our server to take it back, and the manager came out and had the audacity to ask us if we wanted the bacon WELL DONE. No madame we would like the bacon cooked!  I then had two bites of my breakfast burrito but it also had raw bacon in it so I let it go.   A second manager came out to see us and I feel bad as he seemed genuinely unhappy with the way things were going, but at that point our breakfast was a lost cause.  We asked for our check. We hoped they would at least not charge us for the avocado toast which thankfully they did not BUT after all that they then charged us $37 dollars for the terrible experience! We weren't the only one with problems either, the table next to us waited 15 minutes for someone to come see them. It was a disaster! Shame, we won't be going back.",

We started with the build your own bloody mary bar and the mimosa flight. Both were absolutely tasty! The mimosa flight flavors are pre-selected but in the bloody mary you can get as crazy as you want. There are over 40 toppings and its all self-serve. We went on a weekday but we were told on the weekend the toppings include meatballs and sliders! We also ordered the breakfast starter\"bruschetta\" which has 3 different toppings but by far the best one was the marscapone and strawberries.we also ordered the fried chicken hash and the carnitas hash. Both were unbelievably good and you get a huge amount of food, easily enough for 2 people for one hash! Definitely will be back the next time we are in Scottsdale!",

We decided to leave the hotel for breakfast at around 9:30am. We checked in and were given a pager, which went off in about 20 minutes (not bad for weekend breakfast spots).  The positives: great location, hip vibe with a DJ, Bloody Mary bar with dozens of fixings, great coffee, cool decor and a really nice bar area with flat panels. Negatives: mediocre service, average food and very high prices. We shared a bacon sampler (undercooked bacon dripping with grease). My wife had a dry and flavorless frittata, while I had the Chilaquiles (I've had better both in the US & Mexico). The coffee and Bloody Mary were delicious.  I recommend this place for the drinks and fun atmosphere. For breakfast, you can do better elsewhere in Scottsdale.",

I could smell the flavor that came along with it and It smelled very tasty.  I ordered the lemon and ricotta pancakes because I love absolutely lemon. The pancakes came out and they were huge and there were four on the plate ! It came with butter, syrup and mascarpone on the side. The pancakes were absolutely delicious . It was everything I expected of the pancakes to be . I don't like overly sweet things so thEse pancakes were perfect . I highly recommend them .   Alec greeted us at the door and we asked for a table outside and he made sure he found a spot on the patio even though it  was pretty full on the patios. Alec was very attentive and had a great attitude! Come in and ask for Alec !   We did not take advantage of the Bloody Mary bar but it definitely looks like a great bar if you are looking for a boozy brunch ! There are fantastic summer specials going on right now for mimosas and bloody Mary's !",

They have a pretty big Bloody Mary bar that you can take advantage of while you wait.  The best part about this place is the $6 mimosas! They have several flavors to choose from. I got the blueberry first, and then the black cherry. Both were awesome! My food was also delicious! I got the prosciutto eggs Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was amazing and the ciabatta bread tasted fresh.  Overall I had a great experience and would go back! Just be prepared to wait awhile if you go on the weekend :)",

The search feature indicated they offered a dog friendly patio, I called to confirm and they did. They mentioned they do not take reservations for under 10 people but the space is good sized and they have three different patios as well. We were seated immediately and greeted by a friendly waitress. She was able to offer some suggestions on our orders and we decided to go with the Carnitas hash (one of the best sellers according to her), the berry waffle, and the chicken and waffle. My husband enjoyed his carnitas, I tried the meat and it was delicious. He mentioned that there were a lot of different flavors that were used in the dish, which almost made it indistinguishable. He mentioned that a hot sauce or more salsa could have enhanced the dish. My mom devoured her berry waffle and highly recommended them. My dad and I both enjoyed the chicken and waffles, you get a little surprise of bacon in the dish. There were a lot of shoe string style onion rings, which were good but perhaps could be fewer. The chicken was white meat, had a good glaze on it and the waffle was delicious. The average meal is around $14 but the portions were pretty decent. If you are looking for something more upscale for brunch, I would recommend Hash Kitchen for sure!",

They have a Bloody Mary bar that's build your own but we usually get the regular order. Everything we have tried from the pancakes to all the hash combos have been amazing! The food never disappoints. Weekends are slammed, come early!",

I kid you not, they have over 40 options for you to build a bloody mary, that's 40225345056 different combinations possible, based on Vodka preferences, bloody mary mixes, toppings!   They have a super diverse menu that there is something for everyone, I love the corned beef hash, and the lump crab and sweet potato hash... I recommend staying away from the Herb Fried chicken, it sounds good in concept, execution hasn't been stellar the couple times I have ordered it.. The breading just isn't crispy.   Word to the wise, they do have a have a DJ on the weekends that can get kind of well LOUD! Def worth a visit!",

Busy is not my choice, but despite, it was an organized chaos. Customers and employees seemed happy and patient.   We started with the build-your-own bloody mary bar.  It was entertaining to say the least.   The food was good. I ordered a mexican scrambler. The French toast (ordered by one of the other people that I was with) little looked amazing.  Honestly, I'd have to revisit and try some other things on the menu before I decide to put this place on my \"go to\" list of favorite places...or not.   Overall, good food, very lively atmosphere and clean environment. It was the highlight of my visit.",

The coolest part is the huge build your own Bloody Mary bar. I do not like bloody Marys, but I thought the variety of things they had to add to it was so neat. It was pretty busy on a Saturday morning, but the three of us were seated pretty quickly. The menu has quite a few options, and luckily for me some great vegetarian stuff! I got a build your own scramble, you get to pick three things (cheeses, meats, veggies). I ordered my scramble with broccolini, spinach, and avocado. My mom also got a build your own scramble, and my grandma went all out and got the cannoli pancakes. We were oogling at other peoples dishes as they were being brought out. Everything looked amazing! Especially those donut things, making a return visit for that. My scramble was delicious, I loved it. The fresh biscuit it came with was good too, and I'm usually not a huge fan of biscuits. The hash potatoes were yummy but I prefer mine a tad more crispy. I don't like cannolis so I did not like my grandmas pancakes, but she loved them! My mom liked her scramble too, although the artichokes turned her scramble brown which worried us at first sight haha. Service was good too! We were all pleased.",

Was very excited to bring friends of mine that just moved to Scottsdale & arriving at 11:15a they said about a 40 min wait...over an hour later they said maybe 15 min so we lucked out & got seats at the bar. Fast-forward 30 min later (once seated at the bar) & ordered, I then get my 'ticket' to go & get in line at the BYO Bloody Mary bar. Trying to be nice but also expressing my frustration, the Bloody Mary Maven proceeded to have serious attitude with me! So literally in the subsequent 15 min it took me to get my Bloody Mary (45 min total at this point) I get back to my bar seat to find my breakfast has gotten cold. I asked that they send it back, take it off the tab, which they did & were super nice about, but really...why would we ever come back here??? If you know you're that busy on the weekend for Brunch, wouldn't you at least hire more staff &/or at least try to serve the people sitting right in front of you at the bar?

I've had the Bloody Mary, berry mimosa, fried chicken hash and the carne asada hash.  I'd recommend them all! Next time I go I'm planning on trying the lump crab and sweet potato hash. The place is pretty unique and has a great vibe.   The only issue I've ever had is being seated. The first time it was an hour wait but for 20 minutes+ the table next to us was open and it seemed like no one else was waiting. The manager ended up seating us there and profusely apologized that we hadn't been sat sooner. He even gave us a drink on the house for the wait which was pretty nice since we had said anything. All in all still a great place and worth your time and money. You'll enjoy it!",

Great reviews, 4.5 stars and the food looked great, so we checked it out.  They do not take reservations, but we got there around 1 PM and we only had a 20 minute wait...and that was because we needed a table for 5.    The wait was not a big deal because everyone got the BYOBM bar.  My goodness, you could just have that for the meal and with all of the toppings available, you could get full off of that.  No hassle trying to close a tab quick, they just add it to your table bill.    The food was outstanding, just check out my pics...yum yum.  The regular coffee was very good and for the price, I am not even sure I would ever get the French press for $6.50.    The restaurant has a trendy LA feel to it.  They even had a DJ playing music (he quit playing music at 1).  The staff was super friendly and welcoming.    The only reason for the loss of a star...the waitress.  She was not horrible by any means, and was at least pleasant, but she forgot several drinks, never refilled my coffee, was scarce, and took a long time to bring anything to us or check on us.  I think half the reason I was still in a great mood is because everything else was so good.  I would recommend for a great Sat/Sun brunch experience.",

Although it's usually crowded, service was outstanding, waits for a table and for our food were minimal on a prime time Saturday morning and the servers were friendly, helpful, patient and efficient. Management has it figured out here! I can't wait for my next breakfast at Hash Kitchen.",

They have a couple of areas outside with a few tables.  The patios seem to be dog friendly, so we might come back with our neighbors dog when we are dog sitting.  I had the Cristina's tamale cakes, it had a corn tamale base and pulled pork with 2 perfectly poached eggs.  My husband had the Mexican Scrambler.  Service was prompt and efficient.  Can't wait to go back and try french toast or the waffles.  I came back the following week and had the lemon ricotta pancakes, they were delicious but incredibly large portion.  Comes with cream cheese frosting, butter and maple reduction sides. Could barely eat half of the three pancakes portion.  I also had the mimosa flight, so awesome. Joe had the carnitas hash, super yummy.  I guess this is our new favorite breakfast place.",

OUCH I need to work out an extra day to burn this off!!!  And of course, got the herb chicken and waffles since I blew the diet plan anyways.  The waffles was good, but I did not taste the vanilla.  The chicken was ok, I did not taste enough flavors.  It was covered by the fried onions on top.    Overall, it was a great time, great service, and good food!",

Our waiter was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice and fun. They have a DJ keeping it lively and fun. In the middle they have a Bloody Mary bar, will have to try it next time. You build your own with whatever you wanna put in it!  Some people had meatballs sticking out of their drinks!  I had the lump crab eggs Benedict and it was delicious. I didn't realize it comes on a biscuit do next time I'll order it with an English muffin. The biscuit was good but crumbled and difficult to eat with the eggs. The cannoli donuts were delicious and vanilla latte was good as well. They have a woman by the name of Bonnie, customer relations. She approached us to ensure everything was ok and that we didn't need anything. Very nice   We will definitely be back to try more items on their menu.",

    "text": "Overall a good experience. When you walk in the decor is the perfect balance of subtle yet eye catching decor (such as the disco ball by the entrance). They have a very large assortment of Bloody Mary options (BYO) type setup; I didn't get to experience it but will do so soon! The corned beef hash was great and very well seasoned and perfectly hot. Our server was very attentive and had a great sense of humor which made the experience all the more enjoyable. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 was the Benedict, while it was good; it had 2 big issues. I was missing a yolk (I somehow only got one yolk instead of the normal 2) and the biscuits they were served on were very different. One biscuit was unusually crunchy and the other was so soggy it was literally stuck to the plate. I will still come back again but I might stay away from the Benedict as I was disappointed by the lack of quality control on it.",

Came back on my bday for brunch with the girls and was super disappointed in the changed recipe of the cereal cocktails. They don't taste anything like \"cereal milk\" anymore and they are unbearably thick. Really hoping the recipe will be changed back to how it used to be.",

The wait time was less than they said it would be. Our waitress was friendly and attentive.   I had the carnitas hash and cannoli cream pancakes. Hash was good but I wish the potatoes were roasted more. Maybe throw the potatoes under a broiler for 5 mins so it caramelizes the edges before adding the carnitas and eggs. The carnitas were tender and flavorful. I liked the corn tortillas on the side to make little tacos. The cannoli cream pancakes were a little dense and the cream was more of a frosting than a traditional cannoli cream but overall it was tasty for what it was.   The highlight of Hash kitchen for me was the experience. Gino came to visit our table and was a very gracious host. He introduced himself, let us know about his other restaurants, and told us to let him know if we needed anything. He made us feel very welcomed! Experience goes a long way and warrants the 5 star rating. The food was good but I will return because of the service and atmosphere.",

    "text": "I came here with my amazing girlfriend on a road trip to the land of cacti. We had some time to kill and this time t'was I that was getting hangry. She crunched the numbers and alas found this gem. Let's get one thing straight. 10/10 simply for the fact there is a disco ball upon entrance. DISCO. BALL. Just shining disco funk from wall to wall. Luckily for my spectacular girlfriend, there was no wait when we walked in so she didn't have to put up with my bad attitude for much longer. Coffee and water was what laid the foundation. They give you an entire pot  which was quite convenient.   She searched their delicious menu for about a year before she decided on the chilaquiles, I chose the herb chicken and waffles, and we split a side of hash browns.    At the last second before our excellent server left, I ordered the mimosa fight which was itself--excellent!  As my girlfriend posted this flight to her gram, I ate all the fruit.   She was not happy but, as I was hangry, I did not see the consequences or honestly care about them at the moment.   The food arrived--her chilaquiles were decent (honestly a bit soggy in my opinion) but the herb chicken and waffle was AMAZING!   Literally the fried leeks on top of the chicken and waffles is too good to pass up--I don't know if they have a side dish of that but I would bathe in their fried leeks.   10/10 would definitely repeat if in the area.   Only downsides were the soggy chilaquiles, the not super funky beat pusher dj, and the bride-to-be who per my girlfriend was puking in the bathroom.   Hey, sometimes you gotta let loose--I mean, we all gotta leek every once in a while right?",

I brought my 2 kids (5 and 9) and my grandmother- I would describe them all as a little high maintenance in restaurants. Drinks- hot chocolate for the kids, mimosas for the adults (strawberry and pineapple). All yummy and extra points for the server that put the hot chocolates in big coffee cups only filled 1/2 way to avoid spills. My 5 yo still managed to break a mimosa glass, however, but the staff took it in stride lol. Drinks were good. Food- kids shared s'mores French toast, side of bacon and side of fruit. The lovely staff split the plates in the kitchen so we didn't have to do it at the table which was super appreciated. The French toast was really decadent. The kids loved it and there was so much left over. I had the lemon ricotta pancakes. OMG they were sooo amazing. I almost never eat sweet breakfasts and I'm so glad I got these. They were huge- easily 3 meals for me. Grandma got oatmeal. Boring. She said it was ok- a little thicker than she prefers but who really goes to a foodie brunch place for oatmeal? She said she's dieting, whatever lol. We all had a great time and I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town.",

They serve it with crispy fried onions on top with black beans, and potatoes. I was thankful for the salt at the table to give my food some taste. The server offered some salsa which I said yes to. When she brought it out I was disappointed it was just Cholula hot sauce. Not what I was expecting at all.   The atmosphere was almost like I was at the club vibe. Normally I wouldn't mind, but at 9am on a Sunday morning not really feeling it. We met up with family before they headed home to Wa. and we couldn't even talk without yelling across the table.   The French toast was dry, the pancakes were crumbly and dry. Honestly the best thing I had was the filtered water they served when I first walked in.   First time in I will probably give them another try when the one closer to home in Arcadia opens .",

Awesome staff, super friendly.  For sure try the avocado toast, topped off with pork. It's DELICIOUS!!!! You think you've had avocado toast, nope, not until you try Hash Kitchen's avocado toast!!!  Breakfast burritos are also really solid too.  Great place for people of all ages!",

We went as a bachelorette party and had a blast making our own Bloody Mary's, trying their unique and fun drinks, and enjoying their delicious entres. Our waitress Lona was EXTREMELY sweet, kind, and helpful. She got us our food and drinks on time, was very accommodating to our wishes and made sure we had a great experience. I would highly recommend this place to a group or even as a date spot. The food staff and drinks were out of this world. If you do check this place out, as for Lona!",

By the time we sat down I was confused about my food choice and drink choice. EVERYTHING looked soooo good.  I was with a friend so we decided to share. Thank goodness because it was hard to make a final order. In the end, we went with one of their Hash and their French Toast. We were not disappointed.   The food was instant. I swear we order our food and had it within 5 minutes. I was amazed because the place is pretty busy.   Great food and service so I am definitely a huge fan.",

Hash kitchen has such a great atmosphere, friendly workers, awesome music, delicious eats, and most of all - a bloody mary bar! Build the craziest biggest bloody mary your heart desires! I have been to Hash the three last past Sundays and have fulfilled my sweet tooth!   The first time I went to Hash I ordered the smores pancakes. They are delicious and the serving portion is huge. A little on the dry side, but nothing a little syrup can fix.   The second time I ordered the banana split brioche french toast and it was the most delicious thing I have ever eaten! My favorite item on the menu. Nice moist toast with warm salted carmel drizzle, carmelized bananas, stawberries, mascarpone in an icecream cone, and nutella. This was heaven! Order this if you have a big sweet tooth like me!  Highly, highly recommend!   This past sunday ordered the cannoli donuts and they are very dry. I thought theyd be nice and moist and melt in your mouth. Disappointed in this item. Basically, it just taste like bread with a tiny bit of mascarpone. I thought these donuts were filled with the mascarpone, but it wasn't just on top. To balance it out I think more mascarpone would do the trick, but I wasnt a fan of them. This however, would not stop me from going back. I'll just stick to the banana split French toast!",

    "text": "I am in LOVE with Hash Kitchen. So much so, that after enjoying breakfast there Sunday, we skipped the complimentary breakfast at our hotel, and came here again on Monday.  The menu is extensive. I had the hardest time deciding what to get. Every time I thought I knew what I wanted, someone else's order would pass by our table. Everything looked so good.   While their egg dishes are good (I tried one of their hashes,) there pancakes and french toast are phenomenal. Their pancakes are huge and fluffy. Cannoli pancakes come with an adorable little cannoli on top. The cannoli cream in between the pancakes is creamy. It ever so slightly melts into the pancakes. Just enough to sweeten the cakes, but not so much that it gets lost. My absolute favorite was the s'mores french toast. It is dessert posing as breakfast. Super sweet, but in a good way. I did not realize s'mores needed french toast and syrup until I tried these. The slices of bread are thick, and hold up well to the toppings. Thick slices also help dissipate some of the sweetness.   I wish the children's menu was as imaginative as the adult menu is. That being said, the portions of the items on the children's menu are large. Quality is just as good as the adult menu. My daughter ended up ordering the banana split french toast (both days.) She love the ice cream cone on top.    I am in agreement with those who say the DJ is too loud. The volume does make it hard to carry on a conversation.   I guess it is a good thing I live nowhere near Hash Kitchen. I don't know if my waistline or pocket book would survive.",

    "text": "Usually, I would give this place a 4 or 5 but several things fell short.  FOOD They have a few unique items, such as the build your own bloody mary. I live for novel foodie things like that, but body marys aren't my thing. The flight of mimosas was quite pretty though. Food was decent but I the bitterness I felt from the 2-hour wait made it difficult to appreciate the texture and sweetness of the french toast. It was pricier than Snooze, but I wouldn't say it was better. I saw a couple of items on Yelp that I didn't find on their menu.  SERVICE I was told the wait would be 45 minutes. Which was reasonable, since it was a Saturday at 11 AM. Trying to not badger the host, around 1.5 hours later, my brother followed up to ask about our place in line. After flipping through a few pages, we were told we were \"second in line.\" Having observed literally everyone come after us being seated, and realizing that their alert device was likely manual rather than automated, we were pretty sure that they mistakenly marked us off the list and forgot.   It was about another 25 minutes for our order to be taken and food to be brought out. Something I found strange was that the waitress apologized for the wait of the food preparation after she saw that I had taken photos of and with the food. However, the amount of time it took for the food to be ready was reasonable, but the wait to be called in was not.   I guess what I'm trying to say it that I would have appreciated a real apology and perhaps a small compensation, especially because the extra 1 hour we waited resulted in pushing back errands and having to cancel plans for that afternoon (we were visiting the area).   Overall, our waitress was nice but Snooze would have been a more welcoming and less disappointing choice. I thought it would be nice to try something different, but I think it's safe to say that it was not worth the wait -- 2-hours for an average 10-minute meal. What's the point of chatting when you're starving and can't hear the person next to you anyway.   Also, I recommend an electronic waitlist for customers to view their place in line through Yelp or another platform. It would allow for people to hang out at a nearby store or grab a drink elsewhere rather than have a huge group of people loitering in the parking area and next to people trying to enjoy their meal. I honestly don't know how people would do it in the middle of summer.     ATMOSPHERE  It's definitely the go-to spot for \"bride tribes\" or bachelorette brunches. I loveee that they allow dogs in the outside seating area. The decoration and cliche phrases on the wall make for a nice background for photos.  As someone in my 20's I thought the live DJ was nice and appreciated the smooth transition between songs. However, I wholeheartedly agree that the music is incredibly loud and that it is not possible to hold a conversation with the person next to you, not the mention, placing an order without repeating yourself. I get putting on a fun and trendy vibe, but the purpose of brunch is usually a catch-up or conversational type of meal, and it's not possible when music is blasting as it would at a night club.  To add on to the rant, the waitress brought back one ketchup instead of two. We weren't sure if they were having people share but I assume she couldn't hear everyone because of the music. I also felt there wasn't sufficient syrup to drown my french toast, and asking for more was an option but I was over it.   PARKING Located at a shopping center, there seemed to be sufficient space. Since they do not have a waitlist via a phone application, the seats outside become filled quickly, so some people will stand in the parking area. Music is super loud, making it difficult for people loitering to notice that someone in their car is trying to back out or pull in.  OVERALL It's a cute place, especially if you want photo ops for a bachelorette party. Water had a strong tap or Arrowhead taste. Brunch food is average, though certain drinks like the bloody mary and flight of mimosas looked fun. They allow dogs in the outdoor seating area. Music is unnecessarily loud. Quality of service is average. Ohh and don't forget to check-in on Yelp for 5% off your order.",

Seriously so incredibly tasty and exactly how I dream of breakfast. The Carnitas Hash is also worth a mention because the flavors are a heavenly combination. For those who love an EPIC Bloody Mary Bar, the Hash Kitchen has one of the best in the Valley. Love Chef Joey and his wife Christina who pour their heart and soul into the dream restaurant. Best Brunch: Check Great for Out of Town Guests: Check",

Bloody Mary bar is the best but don't overdo it with all the fixings or you are not going to be able to eat your breakfast. I have enjoyed many items on the menu but For me, Lump Crab Hash is the best. Amazing crab meat. The real shit. Great service also. And if you have room still at the end, go for one of the craft starters ... or get started with one (but share it!!).",

As well as an over medium egg & a side of bacon. Egg & bacon were both cooked to perfection. I got the brisket over corn bread hash with 2 poached eggs which may make me fly into Phoenix on a Sunday morning just to get it all again. The servers were incredible as well. They were there when we needed them and were pleasant when we held them up with questions and overall thank yous. They also gave us great suggestions on our way out for other things to do while here! 10/10!",

After waiting an hour to be seated, we were then seated outside where, I believe, they forgot about us. The manager came out to ask if we needed anything, which at this point, our water glasses and coffee mugs were empty. As we're our tummys! When we first got to the restaurant, We waited in line to get Bloody Mary's, then we were told they were running out of supplies and they could make a half one. What??!! Ok, so no Bloody's. Fine. Moving on, we ordered our food. 45 minutes later, out comes the food. Mine was cold as was my mothers. Sorry, I know they were busy, but that's just not acceptable. There are too many great breakfast spots in Scottsdale to return here. Never again.",

I truly tried to be objective but the Eggs Benedict with Crab was bland, covering equally bland and dry biscuits. The waffles lean heavily on syrup for flavor.  It's telling when we observed a very nice hostess walking from table to table asking patrons if they needed more syrup and sauces instead of asking how they were enjoying their meals.   Fun for a one time visit but we won't be regulars.",

    "text": "Don't get me wrong by my 2 star review. The food is good, the DIY Bloody Mary bar is awesome it all comes down to service. I have visited here twice. Once during the hustle of a Saturday morning where it is extremely busy. Our poor waiter must have been extremely stretched because we saw him three times. Once to take our order, second time to deliver our drinks (food was delivered by someone else) and the third time to give us our check (after we had to look for him to pay). There was no check in to say \"How does everything taste, do you need anything?\" nothing to that matter. The restaurant was full despite the 20 minute wait which is not bad. The table next to us had like 14 people in their party which our waiter was helping with among the other tables around us. So needless to say we didn't get much help in regards of getting a refill and extra condiments. Again, super busy but I totally get it just kind of a let down. Maybe schedule more people/waiters for the weekend which I would think would be obvious. They had a DJ that morning which was really cool to see at a restaurant.  The second time we visited was a Wednesday morning. No DJ during the week. but better service for sure. It wasn't extremely busy but it was busy for a Wednesday morning. We sat down right away there were waiters coming by regularly to fill our water, and our plates were cleared quickly once done. Our waitress was super nice and attentive. The burger and fries were tastey.   Moral of the review: I would visit again but I'll think twice before visiting again on a weekend. I would recommend the same to others who would like attentive service and a quiet atmosphere.",

They also have mimosa flights and a Bloody Mary bar. What more could you ask for? My favorite thing to order is definitely the chilaquiles and me being Mexican I can say these are the best chilaquiles I've ever had because they're so authentic. Love love LOVE HASH KITCHEN!!",

Very impressed by that, and he immediately acknowledged the mess up, and offered to have the meal recooked or something else brought out or a discount. As we had already ordered more food than we could eat I asked for the discount. Instead of a discount though, he comped my entire meal. I was blown away.   Most importantly, the waffle was the best waffle I have ever eaten.",

    "text": "Did breakfast just become a reason the reason for me to pull out my old club hopping clothes?! I think it just might have! Call me a bad Yelper but instead of reading a few reviews for The Hash House I just saw the pictures of the great looking food and decided I needed to try everything asap!! Little did I know I was walking in to The Breakfast CLUB. For real!! The DJ Spinning, the mimosa flights flowing, and that Bloody Marry Bar... dude... that thing is no joke!!   It has been some time since I have gone to breakfast/brunch, so I was a real dumb dumb thinking I was going to take me and my friends out to a nice brunch on a Sunday afternoon with no wait. Who do I think I am!? Thank god for the good tunes the DJ was spinning (Yea that's right, apparently on Sunday's they get real lit with DJ playing all your favorite jams.) The massive Bloody Marry Bar, where I had a bacon infused vodka, with all kinds of goodies, including a giant meatball. Which I have to say was the best dang meatball I have ever had. (I don't have much experience with meatball's so give me a bit of a break.) And of course with the help of some great company the hour flew by pretty fast.   Our table of 6 was sat in the cute dinning area and promptly greeted by our server. We had already had drinks, but we knew we wanted to start off with those Cannoli Donuts. They were snatched up and devoured right away. I got a full order (Protip: you can do 1/2 order of most of their entree's. These are pretty large plates. 1/2 order is like a normal amount of food haha.) or the Carrot Cake Pancakes. I was actually a little disappointed in these. They were delicious but they just did not taste much like a Carrot anything. And I was missing my cream cheese frosting. If it were there, I had no idea. The pancakes were still perfect though. Fluffy, buttery, with the maple reduction, topped with those crispy Sweet Potatoes, it was still a great dish. My husband had the Lump Crab Benedict. I got to try a few bites. Very good, tons of crab, lots of flavor. And I also got a few bites of the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Unlike the Carrot Cake, I was definitely able to get the Lemon flavor of these babies. I washed everything down with a great cup of coffee.   The only problem we had was our bill. We sat about 20-25 minutes at the end of our meal. We had things that we had asked to get boxes for, we had asked for 3 checks and then I think he forgot about us. Really I think he just thought we had already cashed out. It happens. I'm not mad. But it did damper the experience a bit. But besides that we really had a great time and wonderful meals. Next time I'm dusting my club clothes off and going to make a day out of this fun breakfast place. Cant wait to come back.",

Mexicana Scrambler. We ordered and our food came out in a nice amount of time. My husband said it was the best breakfast he's ever had. We went to brunch with our 8 mo old daughter, and the staff talked with her too. We enjoyed ourselves. We will try to go back before we leave. (We're currently on vacation from Manhattan, KS).",

Their menu is eclectic but I've never had a dish I didn't enjoy and I've tried something new each time. Went with my girlfriend once and she got the breakfast lasagna which was actually so good! The breakfast bruschetta is my favorite morning appetizer. The carrot cake pancakes are SO good. And the fried chicken and waffles with leeks is outstanding. With some hesitance, I had one of the crab dishes once too which was actually wonderful and I would definitely get again. I almost forgot the most important thing ab this place- the Bloody Mary bar! Too many selections and toppings it's hard to make decisions. Very fun to go in a group for brunch just for the bloody Mary's alone! All in all I hope this place keeps up the good work and we will definitely keep coming back.",

    "text": "The food was just okay, but not worth the price and the service wasn't great either. When we were seated we had to wait almost 10 minutes just to get water. We tried to order the mimosa flight with 4 different flavors, which the menu lists 6 flavors to choose from; however, we were told on the weekends that it's a set choosing of only 3 flavors. The flavors change on the weekends and one of the flavors that was included on this particular Saturday wasn't even listed on the menu. I suppose if you like mimosas and options, go here during the week. We ended up changing the drink order because of the lack of options to the prosecco smash, but didn't get our drink until we were more than half way done with our food. (despite having inquired with the server a couple times) When our food was delivered we were never asked if we needed any condiments, etc. since there weren't any on the table and the food was fairly bland. We tried to track down the server, who was friendly, but nowhere to be found, to ask for hot sauce and some butter for the biscuits. We finally got him after 5 minutes , but then had to wait another 5 just for him to bring the condiments. You're probably wondering why I rated this place a three star after all this, but the people watching and entertainment that happens here is probably the best and helps you to look past the quality of food and service.  If you just want an entertaining breakfast, go here, but if you're looking for really great food and service, I wouldn't recommend it.",

The husband and I made the 30 min drive out to the restaurant to find... they're closed! Bummer. Not sure if this was an error on Hash Kitchen's side or the New Times, but it was pretty sad. Anyway, I still wanted to try them out, so a few days later we made the trek out there again. The restaurant still looks like the old Cuttlefish restaurant, including the oyster bar, which is a bit strange. The service was good, but one of the women there, maybe the owner or manager wasn't being terribly nice to her employees within earshot of customers. Anyway, we had coffee, which was good and the waiter kept it full, so we appreciated that. For food, I tried a benedict and the husband had biscuits and gravy. The b&g was bland and nothing special. The benedict had perfectly cooked eggs, but lacked in flavor.... overall we weren't super impressed. Maybe the secret is to order one of their more complicated dishes (something with fried chicken possibly) and that would be good, but generally you also expect a restaurant to have good foundations. I probably wouldn't make the drive out there to return.",

I visited their make your own Bloody Mary bar,which is second to none, and created the most gluttonous Bloody Mary ever. My wife ordered her new go to breakfast dish which she tries every place we go now. Their twist on chicken and waffles is Herb Crusted Chicken and Waffles topped with fried leeks and she was in food heaven. My son's chocolate chip pancakes were a perfect mix of sweet and light with a delicious maple reduction syrup. I had the Ranchero Hash which was perfectly crispy tortilla chips on a bed of black beans, potato hash, and carne asada topped with an on point over easy egg. Our dessert, which we would have never ordered for breakfast, was a sweet and savory house made cannoli donut. The best part of all was when the owner came out and introduced herself and chatted with us for several minutes. We felt extremely well-taken care of and can't wait to go back.",

We came to celebrate a birthday and were told the day before that they didn't accept reservations less than 10 people (we were a party of five). We decided to get there right when they opened so we wouldn't have to wait. The manager asked if we wanted to sit outside and when we asked to have a table inside, he acted like it was a big deal (which makes no sense because it was empty and there were plenty of tables that were clearly not reserved). Apparently they were understaffed by 3 people and their ticket machine was down so our ticket was lost or never got printed, we are still trying to figure that out. It took over an hour to get our food, which came before our appetizer and everything was just awful. The food tasted sour, undercooked, and messy. It was embarrassing. It took over 20 minutes to get condiments and everyone looked so unhappy there. While the server tried her best, and genuinely felt awful about our experience - I am most shocked that the three managers knew what was going on and purposefully avoided our table. 10/10 would not recommend. They also expected us to pay the whole bill when everyone ate less than a forth of our food because it was so awful. We left and went to another restaurant for breakfast. If management continues the way they handled our situation, this place will not be there long. I understand why 3 people didn't show up today if they had to work for those three morons who don't know how to manage a business.",

    "text": "This place seems overrated. We typically do brunch at places that take reservations so we don't have to wait, but decided to give it a shot since there's so many amazing reviews and the menu looked delicious. We waited 45 minutes - super busy on a Sunday morning - good sign, right? Ordered the breakfast lasagna which is highlighted on the menu as a specialty. When it came out (which took a while, the server even mentioned the food was probably taking a minute because the lasagna needs a while to cook), noodles were still semi hard - not al dente just not cooked - and it was barely even warm. Our server (she was super nice, no complaints there) asked if I wanted to try something else and I ordered the fried chicken salad sandwich. While I waited for my food I my husband and I split was waffle which was good, but his corned beef hash was rough - the potatoes looked like they were microwaved - not a single bit of crispy. Our friend's side potatoes were the same. Pretty disappointing for a place pretty much named after crispy potatoes lol. Everyone I was with had finished their food and I was still waiting for mine. My sandwich came out overloaded with sprouts and lacking mayo or any sort of sauce so it was dry. Also pretty flavorless which was also disappointing since it was fried chicken. My fries, undercooked like everyone else's potatoes. The manager apologized for the wait for my meal replacement and said he was taking care of it - which was nice that it was acknowledged but I had already waited that long I wouldn't have known the difference if they'd just taken the time to make my food properly. I feel like they may have too many items on their menu for their own good - they're too busy. Not sure if we'll try it again mostly because it felt like a waste of time. I did appreciate how the staff handled things but I know they can't necessarily control the quality of the food that comes out.",

    "text": "Bye bye Cuttlefish, hello The Hash!  We had a group of 15 for a Sunday birthday brunch. I have called 2 weeks ahead to reserve a table.  They don't normally accept reservations but only for big groups. I arrived early to drop off the cake and was told my reservation wasn't there.  I was a little stunned, but they were really accommodating to fit our party.   I sure missed those motorcycle bike seats at the oyster bar when it was Cuttlefish. They took them out and replaced with a DIY Bloody Mary bar.  At $7, you get to customize however you like it.  I guess the V8 juice wasn't bad either for the non-drinkers.  Who doesn't like Slim Jims? The Slim Jims added the special kick in the drink plus made a great snack while waiting for our entrees.   Herb Chicken and Waffles were popular among our table. I tried something different and went with the Herb Chicken Egg Benedict. My herb chicken was amazingly good. JL had the same chicken but hers wasn't that great. They must have made a different batch. We probably ordered all their herb chickens for that day.  As for the Egg Benedict, nothing too special. The hollandaise sauce might need a little work. It was really bland.    For the coffee fans, must try the French Press. One of the better quality coffee blends a brunch place. It was so rich and smooth. I think I probably drank 1/2 of the pot. So good!    The staff provided exceptional level of service. They kept our water and coffee filled at all times. When it was time for the cake, I believe it was the owner that went around the table and handed us with a new plate. He even brought and lighted the many candles on the cake.    Another scrumptious brunch place big enough space to have a large group. They even have a live DJ by the bar area. I believe it ends at 1PM. I don't know if this location was cursed or what, but hopefully, this place can hold on and stick around a little longer.",

They also have mimosa flights which allow you to try some different flavors.  The menu is super unique and offers a wide variety of different options.  I fell in love with the fried chicken eggs benny.  The chicken has a great blend of spices, it's not overpowered by hollandaise, and to top it off - fried leeks, surprisingly delicious.  My only reason for not giving it five stars is that sometimes the service can be hit and miss at the bar and it's a little on the pricey side.  There can definitely be a wait to get in here but it's worth it.",

    "text": "Probably the funnest brunch experience I've had. We went on a Sunday morning around 11 and had about an hour wait. But during that wait you can order drinks at the bar and build your own bloody Mary's ! You just pay for the cup and fill your cup with whatever toppings you want and munch on that while waiting. It makes the wait seem to go by a lot quicker.  Gotta admit, the service is where one star gets knocked off. They are very busy and they seemed a bit understaffed. When we looked inside there were quite a few empty tables so they couldn't turn them around quickly.  But the food and drink were solid. Their hash is the way to go. My group of friends and I ordered 5 different ones. And they were all unique and tasty in their own ways. Also, their mimosas flights are 16 dollars for 4 glasses which I think is a great deal. Would love to come back if I'm in the area again !",

    "text": "This was a great choice for Arizona Breakfast Weekend! My brother and I came on a Sunday morning when they opened and basically had the cute place to ourselves. Our waitress Jen was great and attentive as we ordered from their ABW menu. I started with an iced tea (comes in an adorable glass jar with a handle) and we both got their cannoli donut, a sweet start to the day. For my entree, I chose the shrimp \"Oscar\" hash which has crispy potatoes, roasted prawns, asparagus, and a bernaise sauce. It was a huge dish! Felt like I barely made a dent in it but was happy to take it home for the family to try. It was yummy too. My brother got their banana brioche French toast and the sampling I had from it was really good.  At $15/person, this was a fantastic way to check out a new (to me) restaurant and their selections. I'd like to come back and peruse their entire menu.  Side note: when we were leaving, I really noticed their sign outside the entrance. It does not match the architecture of the building and think it could use an upgrade!",

Meatballs, fried raviolis, slim jims, flavored vodka, bacon, olives, peppers... you name it. It was easily a meal in itself.   If you're not a Bloody Mary person (then what's wrong with you!?) they have a great mimosa selection! We got the flight with original, raspberry, mango and kiwi. If you don't need four full size drinks at 9am go with the mango.   Now that we were good and tipsy we got to eat breakfast. I had the monkey bread which was incredible. But I actually ate more of my friends plate of the breakfast cannelloni. Sounds weird, I know but trust me it was incredible. Ugh, I'm drooling just thinking about it.   Can't wait to go back for round two and try everything else! LOVE this place!",

I was looking forward to enjoying a nice French press with my breakfast, but they were out (ugh!!!) of it so we had to settle for their regular coffee which was okay but then we weren't even given spoons to stir our cream, had to use our butter knives, I hate that! Then, we get our food, nothing special, I tried the tamale cakes Benedict and my husband had the salmon charcuterie board, both were plain, really small portions, and left us wanting something more. The bloody Marys are such a gimmick too, I mean sure, they have an awesome bar of goodies to pack your bloody with, but the actual flavor of the Bloody Mary is not good, so you're paying for the gimmick basically. I tried a mimosa, I seriously think they forgot the champagne!  So overall, super pricey for what you get and so not worth it! I'll stick with Snooze, OHSO, Matt's, Wildflower, and Elly's for brunch!",

The menu had tons of options and everything looked so good we couldn't stop staring at what other tables had. They have a Bloody Mary bar that was huge although we got a coffee and iced tea. The avocado toast looked soooo good but just too much (you could for sure share it) so I got the build your own scramble with avocado,  bacon and cheese, it came with a biscuit and also potatoes. The portions are just so large (too large in my opinion as you're eating so much and way too full or you're wasting some of your food). They don't offer half orders on a lot of things so although I wanted to try the avocado toast I could not eat that much food and it doesn't make for good leftovers. My scramble was basic and good, I loved the biscuit option. My boyfriend got the lump crab bene he also enjoyed that it came on a biscuit but he is a bigger fan of crab cakes. It was nice to have but probably wouldn't order again. Also got the half order of French toast that was coconut crusted (we wanted to try pumpkin one but they couldn't do a half order). We were so full but managed to squeeze some bites in. For the two breakfasts, coffee, tea, and one slice of French toast I believe it was $48 before tip. So it's a little pricey, but again large portions and probably normal price point for the area.  1. Large portions, bring a group so you guys can share/try more things. 2. Please offer more plates to have halves as some people cannot eat that much!",

First of all, Lona, provided us with top level service! She was so happy and helpful and very friendly! They have a great Bloody Mary bar with tons of vegetables & other stuff including flavor fused vodka! Two of us ordered the carnitas hash & eggs and both of them said it was incredible. (See photos) My buddy ordered just hash & eggs and he said it was perfectly cooked and very filling. Finally, I ordered the huevos rancheros hash. The presentation was amazing (again see photos)  I've never had rancheros quite like this. It was stacked 6\" high with crispy fries onion rings with an unbelievable green sauce! Fantastic!  The prices were amazing, the service was great, and the consensus of everyone in my group was that we would ALL definitely return!!",

Things happen, but there were only two of us.  Good - Food was good. I wasn't that hungry by the time it came because the wait was so long we went to panera next door for a snack. (We were hungry, ok?) Also, I put a meatball in my Bloody Mary, which really filled me up.  Great - Bloody Mary Bar. I literally thought Bloody Mary Bars only existed in my dreams. Then I went up North Scottsdale road and found Hash and my dreams came literally True.   Overall, good experience and good food. Definitely going back when I'm less hungry in order to accommodate the long wait time. Worth it.",

    "text": "I want to start off my review by saying Hash messed up my order. I know you're thinking but you gave them 5 stars. Yes I did because of their EXCELLENT customer service. The manager fixed my order so quickly and offered to provide me other menu items while I waited.   Now from the beginning. I'm here on business and my husband and I haven't been lucky with the restaurants in Scottsdale. I went to Hash because it was fairly close to my hotel and the food looked delicious. Our wait was between 45min and one hour which I expected because it's Mother's Day.   We were seated an hour later outside and it was great. We started with the mimosa flight and OMG yes, yes, yes they were AWESOME SAUCE!!! I asked the waiter for non pork recommendations and she provided a few. I ordered the chicken and waffles and my husband had the steak and eggs.   Our meals arrived and the presentation was great. I dive right into my food and notice some little pieces of meat in my waffle. I have my husband look and yep it's bacon in the waffle mix! Well I tell the waiter and she had the kitchen prepare another meal. No big deal. Well the replacement arrived with a new waffle but the same chicken. I sent it back again because I can't have the chicken because it was on top of the bacon waffle. By now the manager walked by and obviously could see my disappointment. I explained to him I don't eat pork due to religion and before I could finish he said ma'am you don't have to explain I'm going to remake your entire meal. At first I declined and he said no I'm going to get it right.   This is why I will be visiting Hash again. The way he handled the situation is how a customer wants to be treated. Also, my meal was complimentary. I completely devoured the chicken and waffles. It was really good.   Plus, they passed out chocolate covered strawberries to all the moms. Although I'm not a mom they gave me one and the gentleman stated well you have a mom. This small gesture meant a lot since 5/13/18 was my mother's 2nd year being gone after loosing her battle to cancer. Thank you Hash!",

With a place like hash kitchen we were thinking they'd have pretty outstanding hash browns but was sadly disappointed. Hubby ordered the smoked salmon egg Benedict and I got the bacon and egg burger. The hollandaise on my husbands eggs were terrible and my burger for some odd reason didn't have an egg! We were seated outside on the patio and quite neglected but famished. Already had to flag the waitress down multiple times just for silverware and napkins, by the time she came back I already finished my burger. Could've been worse but we won't be back.",

She is not good at her job.  Maybe it was her first day or she is just not cut out to be in service.    A table inside also complained about her lack of care and checking on them.

Was told the wait was 1hr 45 min, but we happened to find a spot at the bar within 30 minutes. (Thank goodness bc 1hr 45min is WAY TOO LONG to wait regardless of the place. The person I was with insisted we wait it out...)  ANYWAY. I was basic and ordered pancakes so I can't say much about the food haha. They were buttery, extremely fluffy and big. Good pancakes. Didn't see the hype about the food but then again I ordered pancakes LOL. Cool atmosphere. Variety of different attire. Women mainly dressed cute with jeans and heels or something of that nature.

I did ask for a side of hollandaise as I found the hash dry without it but that could also have been because we ordered the eggs scrambled and not runny or sunny side up. There was a live dj and the decor was very fresh and modern. We will definitely be back next time we are in Arizona.",

We had the biscuits and gravy which was served with Italian sausage that didn't have much flavor at all. The gravy was not very inspiring either.  We also had the boring Benedict that was served with their hash browns which were actually home fries with a spice in it I think Rosemary that was not to my taste. The hollandaise sauce i am pretty sure was from a can. The server was friendly, the food came up very quickly, the bill was $32 which is about average for a breakfast place of this nature. Probably we won't be back.  but it was obvious very many people thought it was a wonderful place because the line was out the door.",

    "text": "Had lunch at Hash Kitchen at Gainey Ranch this past Fri, July 5.  Upon entering the restaurant we noticed how loud the music was.  So loud, that I had to shout to the hostess that we were a party of 3.  She asked if we wanted to sit inside....NO WAY....IT WAS SO LOUD THAT YOU COULD NOT HAVE A CONVERSATION.  Others in line for the hostess complained about the loud music as well.  We were seated outside....the DJ  music was still so loud through the outdoor speakers that normal conversation was not possible..  When our lovely waitress Danielle asked us what we wanted to drink, we had to ask her to repeat it.  We asked her if the music could be lowered a bit so that we could hear one another.  She apologized that she could not do anything about it.  We then asked for a manager.  She came to our table right away.  We politely said the music was so loud and asked if she could please lower it .  She said she had no control of it, that this is how the absentee multiple owners want it.  Why do these owners have a manager that is not allowed to deal with issues to try to make their customers happy?  Then what is her purpose?  The manager said she would pass our comments on to the owners.  Moments later, we learned that the couple that was seated at our table prior to our arrival walked out because the music was so loud.  We opted to shout at one another, just as other seated guests had to do.  Two friends ordered from the breakfast menu and loved their food.  I opted for the Toasted Cous Cous and Kale salad with grilled chicken.  When my entree was presented, I noticed that there was no cous cous.  Danielle graciously apologized, and took it back to the kitchen,  I also asked if I could please have some olives.  She returned quickly with my corrected salad, however, the kitchen added the olives from the bar.....they were stuffed with large cloves of raw garlic!!!!  When I cut the sliced chicken breast meat it was rubbery as if it were not cooked through.  I bit into the chicken and the texture was not right.  My friend also tried it, and she split it out.  I did not eat the salad as I was very concerned that it was not safe.    Hopefully management will respond to the comment that was passed on to them.  I understand that this is a concept restaurant, but is the concept supposed to be that the loud music disrupts your dining  experience?",

We loaded up at the bloody Mary bar, split the giant Lights Out Mimosa (it comes with a pinwheel and cotton candy!) and shared the Bacon sampler, gluten free pancakes, and eggs Benedict. Everything was delicious! The bloody mary mason jar was a bit smaller than I expected but still very good and I like how you can choose different flavors of vodka and spice, in addition to all of the other fun ingredients. I would expect a wait after 10am. We arrived at 9:30 on a Sunday and didn't wait more than about 15min. I also recommended to my cousin visiting on a girls trip and her friends had a blast.",

It just gets really busy on saturdays and sundays so I would advise you to go at 915a-930a for no wait. For holidays I usually like to call ahead and make a reservation. Dino Hinojosa greeted me and thanked me for coming in (after I checked in and got the 5% off). He mentioned that the gainey ranch Hash Kitchen no longer takes reservations. He said it doesn't look inviting to people who are visiting. The food and services are great but the one on Frank Lloyd Wright takes reservations and is bigger. If they allow people to make reservations ahead of time just like all other restaurants, I think I would give this place 5 stars. Dino was helpful and alert! Will be back.",

A little searching on Yelp! uncovered The Hash Kitchen, and we are pleased to report that the rave reviews are 100% accurate.  From start to finish the staff couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating, we were seated immediately on the outdoor patio, all questions were answered in a helpful way, and we never waited more than a few minutes for anything we needed.  Now on to the star of the show - the food.  Wifey absolutely loved her french toast as well as the perfectly crisp side order of bacon she went for.  I was indecisive with a few breakfast offerings, that is until our waitress recommended the huevos rancheros hash - i'm extremely glad that I took her advice.  This was by far one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  The combination of veggies, perfectly cooked steak, eggs & crispy onions was phenomenal, something I'll often wish I had available back in New York.  Overall this is a do not miss spot in the Scottsdale area.",

I had the breakfast sandwich with bacon. It came out cold and was just meh. It was definitely not worth the 1 hour+ wait. If you are looking for a breakfast with that long of a wait I would suggest going somewhere else. Also, seemed like it was more of a drinking spot with the bloody mary bar setup in the center of the restaurant.",

If you're looking to get the party RE-STARTED, then YES, this is your place!  I loved the super cute hostesses, the DJ bouncing and spinning and the overall, upbeat vibe of the clientele.  The people who come here know what they're getting themselves into. There's a HUGE DIY Bloody Mary bar with ravioli, cured meats, cheeses and MEATBALLS! Even though the place was packed, the server (Max) still greeted us quickly and made us feel like we were the only people he was taking care of.   We started with the Cannoli donuts, and they were so hot, fresh and delicious, I had a hard time saving one to take home for my kiddo! I had to save a little room for a blueberry mimosa and some herb fried chicken eggs benedict!   My husband had the Carnitas Hash.  FORGET WHAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT BREAKFAST IN THE VALLEY.  The Carnitas Hash here is ALL you need...EVER. We will be back again and again.  This is a GREAT place for a birthday party or other group.  I can't wait to have an excuse to bring in a big crew and get the party STARTED!",

Dj spinning on Saturday to wake you up and get you groovin' and a superb Bloody Mary bar with all the Fixins' ... But wait! There's more they also serve bottomless mimosas in many different Flavors made with fresh fruits and if you're not in the drinking mood you can order up a carafe of French pressed coffee ( they serve Lavazza )  Linda, the manager, is a doll and is known as \" mama Linda \" loved meeting her.  I give Hash Kitchen a perfect 5 stars for being the best next day remedy to a night out in DTScottsdale. Sunglasses on!",

I've been coming here 1-2 times a month, and today was the first time I left feeling underwhelmed.  We were quoted 20-25 minutes for a table.  After 50 minutes I asked if they had lost our table, I was assured that they hadn't and it would be a few more minutes.  I got the feeling that the host was so overwhelmed with the chaos that he couldn't manage the situation.  We were seated after 1 hour and 10 minutes. It was another 15 before our server visited the table. We saw multiple couples who were sat after us have their orders taken, and food delivered before we were able to order.  When we received the food we were both underwhelmed with what we were given.  My side of bacon consisted of two raw pieces and one burned black; my friends scramble was watery and flat.  The bloody mary bar is a nice touch, and the server there always remembers what we order.  She is a rock star, and a benefit to the restaurant. Bonnie is also a wonderful ball of energy!  I'm not sure if something has changed here, or we just caught them on a very bad day but I likely won't be back to find out.",

So much so we couldn't decide what to eat and totally over ordered; pretzel Benedict with bacon. Yes. It exists and it's amazing. Ricotta lemon pancakes. Italian hash and don't forget; grab the cannoli (donut)! So good. Literally didn't have a thing that wasn't excellent. We left so full but wanting to eat more. Also, our server, Lona, was just as much part of the great experience. I asked for Stevia for my coffee and because they don't carry it she brings packets from home, in case anyone asks, to keep her customers happy. That's above/beyond level customer service. The only bad thing I can say is, I wish we lived here as I'd visit every weekend. LOL  This place is a must try. You won't be disappointed. Trust me.",

It's a bit far from where I live but by the quality of the food I will definitely be visiting again. First off the mimosas were amazing. The first one was like $8 or $9 but the four I had after  that were only a penny so it was a really good deal. Now for the food what can I say? It was exquisite. I had egg and shrimp hash with a biscuit. It was all amazing. The biscuit wasn't too dry like at some other places and the shrimp tasted phenomenal. Lastly service was amazing outlet waters were always filled up when they were almost empty and we never waited too long for anything. Great place and will definitely be back",

Although we didn't try it, they have an extensive, impressive Bloody Mary bar. Husband tried the house sangria and said it was the perfect blend of sweet and strong.   In terms of food, so many delicious looking options. If you like seafood try their lump crab frittata or lump crab sweet potato hash -- both were excellent. We also split a 1/2 order of apple pie pancakes and they were delicious. A 1/2 order comes with two large pancakes and is plenty, especially if you just want a taste of sweet along with your full savory meal.   If you're looking for a fun brunch environment this is your spot. Do expect a wait during the busy brunch hours.",

The DJ was right behind us and the place was NOISY!  Ok, if you're looking for lively, then it might be your cup of tea.  We ordered a bloody mary and the BM bar had tons of options for add-in's but the basic drink was meh.    Service was good and the food was prompt.  It was average fare which probably suits most.  Actually the biscuit with a salty top was maybe my favorite item on the plate.  Certainly large enough portions to fuel most people.  Suffice it to say, as long as you are looking for what they have to offer, you might like it more than me, but I'm off to search for more ambiance, less noise and a little better taste.",

All of my coworkers raved about it, friends loved it and needless to say I was excited. Once seated, our waiter came around for drink orders. Me and my friend both got the bloody mary bar (my favorite whenever I brunch). After receiving a ticket to go get our drinks, we then had to wait inline at the bar to receive our vodka and mixer. That wait alone, was 15 minutes. Keep in mind, this is on top of having waited for a table and then the server to return with our tickets. Any other restaurant I have been to returns with the vodka and mix and you are then able to go and garnish as you please... not here. The selection at the bloody mary bar was great except half of the items were already gone. We were there at maybe 11am so it wasn't late in the day at all. The bloody mary itself, was delicious, but our table having to wait on us to order meals didn't make much sense. I ordered the prosciutto eggs benedict - meh. I would never order it again. No flavor and the bread was hard as a rock. No one seemed overly impressed with their food - my husband got a hash skillet (Italian maybe?) and he said it was just OK. For the price, and the wait time, there are plenty of better brunch spots.",

I'm hoping I caught them on an off day and all the new restaurants opening are not diminishing the product. My son got a Bloody Mary per my recommendation. He came back with it virtually empty. They  had not refilled it so there was no bacon and many other items. Our meals were served without the biscuits. Our waiter told us they were making fresh ones, they'd be out in 5 minutes. 30 + minutes later we left without having them. The food, previously amazing, was only adequate. I don't want to write this place off so I will be optimistic that this was an aberration.",

We tried the lemon ricotta pancakes which were great especially because they weren't too sweet and the whipped mascarpone was pretty much all you needed; and we tried the huevos rancheros hash which was absolutely amazing! We also got a side of the sweet potato hash which I was a little wary of but it ended up being my favorite! Definitely a great place to eat",

    "text": "Let me premise this by saying the food was delicious. However the service was not very good for it only being tuesday afternoon, only 6 or so tables with customers and having a few waitresses. I tend to be very patient and understanding of what a waitress goes thru. However, our waitress, Katy, did not even take our order we flagged down another waitress after waiting a good 15 min for her to acknowledge us. I normally would not complain about the amount of times a waitress comes but I sat there and watched her go to her other tables 2-3 times and actually converse with them. Meanwhile she had only come to our table once. I finally got up to get the manager to let him know our table was completely ignored and before I could finish my sentence he turned around walked away from me and got our waitress. She came back to the table with our check and did not ask if we needed anything. My mom had to ask her not to go just yet and if  she could  bring us to go boxes. Although the manager was polite he did not ask what he could do to remedy the situation or what we needed. We visited the other Hash Kitchen and on a busy Sunday morning and we received better service than this location. First time in my life I did not leave a tip. Like I said I have a great deal of patience and understanding for what waitresses do but we were flat out ignored compared to her other tables. That combined with the  rude behavior from the manager, I will not be visiting this location again.",

As a North Scottsdale resident and someone who is really familiar with brunch after living in Southern California, it's really refreshing to have The Hash Kitchen nearby with a creative menu including endless delicious options with a social atmosphere. As a twenty something professional, The Hash Kitchen is a great restaurant for business meetings but is also the ideal space to gather with friends for a weekend brunch gathering with the DJ and morning cocktail options.  I highly recommend the Lump Crab and Sweet Potato Hash for a savory dish and the Encrusted Coconut and Almond French Toast for a sweet option. The service is top notch and our server was always on top of our orders and coffee refills/beverages.  If you're a foodie or a brunch enthusiast, this is the place to be!",

Since it's a weekday and they haven't had their grand opening yet, we were among the few patrons this morning, but everything was fantastic! The service was delightful, just the right level of attentive without  being intrusive, and the food... The food was perfect. I had the Nutella and banana French toast, when it came out I thought they had brought me plain French toast, but tucked away between those layers of bread was delicious chocolatey goodness. The hubs had a brisket hash brown skillet, he loved that there was cornbread in the dish as well as on the side. The French press coffee was a nice touch, and another day (read: not a workday) we'll be coming back for mimosas.",

CJ brought us complimentary biscuits and meatballs!  Very nice touch!!! CJ and Linda the manager came over to apologize, and to tell us our meal was being comped. What could have been an unpleasant dining experience was turned in a GREAT one!! Linda then brought us a complimentary fruit tray!  Class Act!!!

Mimosas are spot on and great variety of fresh and seasonal juices. Menus rotate every few months which may be discouraging since the Paella Hash was on POINT. Hubby had a consistent menu choice of the carnitas hash. Perfect brunching spot for FANTASTIC food, trendy atmosphere, and speedy service.

I live in Reno and visit the Phoenix area 3-4 times a year and I try to go to the Hash kitchen on every visit. However, our service was TERRIBLE this past Sunday. We waited an hour (to be expected with a party of 7) but then waited another 15 minutes (not an exaggeration) just to order DRINKS!! NOT okay! Come on, if we already waited to get to the table, take our drink order within 5 minutes! The kitchen wasn't behind because after we finally placed the food order, it came within 10 minutes. I will be back, but our waitress wasn't even apologetic. Sorry, not sorry you got a 5% tip.",

The place has a nice range of brunch items. You can have something sweet or savory depending on your mood. I tried the pretzel benedict which was a great twist an eggs benedict  that replaced the English muffin with a pretzel. This is something I would get again and again. Also since it was the weekend, the place had a live DJ. We thought this was awesome and definitely kept an upbeat vibe in the restaurant.",

Great atmosphere and everyone was attentive and sweet Boonie visited our table a couple times. LOVE HER! DJ was playing great music and it was packed in there.   The food arrived shortly. We ordered Cannoli Donuts, two of the other girls ordered Carnitas Hash, one of the other girls ordered the Herb Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict, and  I ordered the Huevos Ranchero Hash. All was delicious and well prepared! I asked for a togo cold brew and they gave me a cup with ice and a jar with a mixed mama's vanilla cold brew in jar ready to go! They're awesome. I'll definitely come back again whenever I come visit Scottsdale again.",

    "text": "Although I enjoy a good breakfast, our quest to find new brunch spots has gradually subsided in recent years. This is largely due to the fact that my girlfriend and I have already went through grueling trial and error experiments in an attempt to firmly establish a set of reliable favorites. And after all, who wants to spend a late Sunday morning experimenting at unfamiliar breakfast places that risk being colossal failures?  But dammit, I keep insisting: Try new places! Don't be like my parents and keep dining at the same five restaurants in constant rotation over the course of two decades. And for this reason, I decided that it was time that we start searching again.   In many ways, I kind of already knew what to prepare myself for while going into The Hash Kitchen (THK). It's one of those entrepreneur \"concept\" restaurants - and one that caters more to the current trends of the modern brunch/bar hybrid - complete with the required thumpy music and flowing mimosa flights.   Joking aside, I really didn't expect much. I've been to places like this before and always end up disappointed in comparison to some of our favorite spots in terms of food quality. Boozing before noon doesn't interest me, so my judgment lies strictly on the food taste.  But in all honesty, we ended up both being impressed with the offerings at THK after a couple of visits. Although there are a handful of menu items that are served at most modern breakfast joints, including the mandatory dessert-like French toast variations, there's also many dishes that are quite unique.  I'm a big fan of their Huevos Rancheros Hash, which includes the potatoes themselves, black beans, cotija, a few tortillas, over medium eggs, avocado, carne asada, and red chili sauce. Their Carnitas Hash is also worth mentioning. My girlfriend also experimented with their breakfast lasagna, but insists that their hash plates are the safer choice.  On a side note, we obtained a half-order of coconut and almond encrusted French toast. We both really liked it, although my gut tells me the Nutella and banana variation would have probably won me over completely. Unfortunately, it's off the menu and when I attempted to order it on a return visit, they claim it doesn't exist anymore - despite having all of the ingredients.   Coffee was good (Lavazaa), while OJ was also some of the best you can find.  Service can vary. During our second visit, our food took forever - to the point where I wish the server would have just admitted that they forgot to put the order in. On a positive, they're all very friendly.  The bottom line is, don't go in here expecting to find a traditional breakfast joint. And in some ways, that's a good thing - as I think as long as you approach this place with an open mind, you'll easily find something here that you can appreciate.  Recommended!",

I am not normally a \"needy\" guest, but I felt like I had to be to get attention here. The only memorable part of the experience was an older woman (the owner?) dancing around to a live DJ. Very cool she's enjoying herself, but I could've used a better product and service while she danced around like a teenager at Panama City Beach spring break.

    "text": "My husband and I came in for brunch on Friday, June 9th. The server near the host counter ignored us even though he made eye contact a couple of times. After waiting and being helped  by Gino we were seated and waited an inordinate amount of time for service. During our wait we watched several other groups of diners experience the same issue. In fact, a family of 4 deserted their table after another group was served before them, even though they had been waiting much longer.  The saving grace of our experience was Gino. He was fantastic, pleasant, and literally ran circles around the other servers on shift. The male Manager seemed oblivious to the lackluster performance of the other servers, particularly a tallish, thin man in early 30s with black hair. There was another female Manager on site that was having to manager the male Manager to stay on top of water refills, etc.  In conclusion, the food was good and the property clean but our focus was unfortunately drawn to the disorganized and lackluster staff - other than Gino. I highly recommend Hash Kitchen ownership take a look at the crew on duty on the morning of Friday, June 9th and get rid of your slacking staff and praise Gino. I would venture to guess that he will burn out sooner rather than later in that environment and he was the best part of the experience!",

I arrived about 10 minutes before she did, so I put my name on the Wait List and tucked myself in the corner of the foyer as it was pretty busy.  The DJ was on the bar side and it was L O U D. So loud, it made me wince, to be honest. Because DJ was so loud, the patrons had to talk loudly to hear themselves so it was just sort of stressful. I was adamant about NOT sitting to the right (bar side).  I dunno... I guess this (DJ Pauly-dude spinning vinyl) feels more natural at a restaurant in the bowels of Old Town, not North Scottsdale. Someplace like R&R, or Geisha-A-Go-Go...? You know??  The hostess/other lady (maybe owner?) kept asking me if my party of 2 wld like to sit at the bar (multiple times). I kept repeating to them I didn't want to because it's too loud and I wanted to visit w/my friend. Very annoying.  My friend and I did get seated to the left side of the restaurant and it was much quieter.   Our server (didn't catch name) was great! I ordered one of his recommendations (Pork Carnitas Hash Skillet w/2 corn tortillas) and was glad, as it was pretty tasty. Pork was nicely seasoned and moist! Came in a small cast-iron skillet pan which was a nice touch. Couldn't help but notice a good amount of grease pooled at the bottom of skillet pan that made my throat close, but it was still good.",

    "text": "This is by far my most favorite brunch spot in Scottsdale! Yesterday was my second time dining there and I wasn't disappointed!   After having a booze filled weekend in Old Town celebrating my friends 30th birthday, we decided we wanted to end the weekend with a fun, mimosa filled brunch. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by the amazing hostess Bonnie and she remembered seeing my husband and I at the restaurant a month ago. It was a really nice feeling for her to remember us and we had only been there once before!  Brunch was FANTASTIC. I had the Mexican scramble and a couple of others got the skillets. We definitely didn't need any doggy bags because everyone cleaned their plates :)  My husband enjoyed the delicious bloody mary bar and everyone at our table took full advantage of the bottomless mimosa deal!  To show you how amazing the service is at Hash Kitchen, they kept the restaurant open until almost 4:00 (it closes at 3:00), because our group was celebrating a birthday and we were all having such an amazing time drinking champagne and just enjoying ourselves.   Thank you Hash Kitchen for the amazing food, atmosphere, drinks and service. You will absolutely see my friends and I again very soon. My husband and I are very excited for the North Scottsdale location that is opening soon!",

My Wife made reservations well in advance and when we arrived we had to wait. We waited 30+ minutes. Big fucking deal. Put your snappy chat, instagram and twitter down and spend some time....you know, talking and hugging it out with your Family. The Restaurant brought out Mimosa's to the hungry and thirsty. I thought they handled themselves well considering the mob and the special day! All that aside, yelp is not about your rude waitress, the slow cook time. We want to know about the food. Every Chef, cook, hostess and waiter/waitress is bound to have a bad day. Please stop bitching about that stuff. Get down to the food. We had a large group and here is a list of everything I actually tasted.  Lemon Ricotta Pancakes - Awesome. Buttery, Lemony, Crisp and Soft edges with moist middle. Almost my favorite ever. Served with a delicious Lemon ricotta topping.  Canolli Donut - Excellent. I would expect canolli creme to be fantastic coming from a Tomasso.   Carne Asada Hash Skillet - Perfectly marinated flat iron with two perfectly poached eggs. Very flavorful on a bed of hash brown cubes potatoes, they could have been crispier and green chilis.  Oreo Pancakes - Delicious in their own right, did not taste much like an OREO. That being said, they were still cream worthy. ya, know...OREO cream worthy.  Carrot Cake Pancakes - Damn good. Like if Upper crust bakery from the long ago Timothy's decided to make pancakes. The crispy fried carrots on top was spot on, different and texturally tasty.  Lamb Hash - Bomb. Period. If you love lamb don't miss this. Juicy seasoned lamb with poached eggs and browns. Good Shit!!  Smoked salmon Benedict. Really, should I go on. Excellent!!  Lastly.... Fruity Pebble Yogurt Breakfast Popcicles. Holy Shit Fred. What a fun and tasty way to start a breakfast. Not filling and full of flavor. I never thought it would work but those pops blew me away. Like a palleta pop thats creamy, a bit tangy from the yogurt and sweet and crispy. Yah, it's good.  That's it. I did not taste one thing that was meh. All food exceeded my expectations. The owner was out and he was very accomodating considering how busy he was. He was funny, relaxed and a small part of why my Family will be back. Can't wait. Fortunate they are right down the road from my house. My waiter. who my Wife said was a manager...I don't know how...was really good. He actually came back and thanked me for my tip. I think he was stunned, I was hoping that if I made him happy, since he made me and my Family happy, that mood would transcend to other diners waiting in the mad house.   Cheers",

Seems like the staff doesn't enjoy they're job either. Definitely don't see myself coming back far better Bloody Mary bars that aren't an entire joke or rip off in Scottsdale. I wasn't going to write a review until when i asked the bartender if she could give us split checks since my meal was more expensive. She basically told us to do the math ourselves until another bartender helped us out. Sorry but When you ring orders in don't you separate seats? Can't believe we spent that amount and still had such awful service. It would have been nice to at least get a smile from someone",

The french toast was alright and I've definitely had better but I guess I shouldn't expect too much since I ordered the plain ones. The hash was pretty good but had a little bit too much corn bread and not enough brisket in our opinion. The service was fast and I would definitely come back to try those chicken and waffles!",

Close your eyes and picture the scene as you walk into and be introduced by the fabulous owner (I don't know her name) but she has pictures with the likes of phelps and Kurt Warner on the wall so yah she's the real deal. The smell of smores and Oreo pancakes intoxicates your nostrils. The friendly patron behind the most complete build your own Bloody Mary bar gives you a wave and a nod as to say \"hello old friend glad to see you again.\" As I'm writing this review Bonnie places her hand upon my shoulder and thanks me for coming.. Bonnie is the owner i now know her name and will be back soon.",

My mom had made a reservation days before we went (they said they don't take them, but they made an exception for her).  When we got there, they had the reservation down for the wrong day.  It was a busy Saturday morning, but they did their best to seat us right away.  We did not realize their was a DJ there on a Saturday morning.  It was VERY loud and we couldn't hear ourselves talk.  It was also very warm and very crowded in the area where we were sitting.    The food was ok.  I didn't love what I ordered, but some of the others that were in our group had some tasty meals.    Definitely not a place to go if you want to have a conversation with others.  Would be better to try it when it's nice out and enjoy their patio area.  Not the best experience for my 40th birthday brunch.",

On Friday the place was less busy and we didn't have to wait. We went out Friday night and being a bit hungover, I was looking for some brunch to cure my headache. When we arrived Saturday we had to wait 10mins which was no big deal. Inside there was a group of college girls enjoying brunch and doing tequila shots - it was quite entertaining. There were multiple birthdays and the ambiance was good. The DJs music was pretty loud and being hungover, it was over stimulating. Had I not been hungover this would have been fine.  Food 5/5 - the menu here is extravagant and it was difficult to choose what to eat (that's why we came back multiple times). Honestly you can go wrong with anything on the menu. If you are up to drink, they have quite the drink selection and custom bloody Mary's and mimosas. I'd definitely be back to do this with a group of friends if I come back.   This place is definitely worth a stop if you are in the area. I'd recommend it to friend and other people visiting for an energetic brunch experience.",

That was a great relief because we were starving!   Our server was prompt and brought us waters out immediately. The menu was thorough and had all the information we needed.   We ordered the chicken and waffles and herb chicken hash. My gf loved the chickens and waffles. She tore it up lol. Said it met her expectations.   As for the hash I got the serving was great. Definitely felt me up. I do wish there was more flavor to the dish. It felt like it was missing some taste to it. I did substitute the poached egg for scrambled. Which probably led to it being dry. It needed some uuoomphh. So I added some syrup and it was good.   Will definitely come back next time we're back in Phoenix.",

Smaller outdoor seating and a smaller dining area but still very consistent for HK. DJ here is probably the loudest of them all. Just remember that this is just a Scottsdale thing and you just get used to it.   I tried something new on their menu. The Carne Asada Torta. Which was really good. The Carne Asada was thick and to the point little hard to bit it off but had thick piece of tomato and cheese. The sauce is what really makes this sandwich. Has a nice kick and really brings out to taste. Very good. Comes with a small bucket of fries. Fries were very crisp which I like and very good. Overall, a very good meal.   My son and wife got one of their usual. The Carne Asada Hash. Standard good as usual. No complaints here.   The service was very good. Our server greeted us right away and got us our drinks. Refilled both water and coffee. She also kept an eye on us asked how everything was.   So overall very good. Consistent ambience for Hash. Loud DJ and everyone having a good time during their meal. Really good food cause I love their Hash dishes and starting to really like their sandwiches too. Really good service too.   So of course I enjoyed this place. Been here multiple times with consistent food, service, and ambiance. I'll be back. Enjoy we always do.",

I came here on a Monday morning and it was still fairly busy; it seemed like they were understaffed or the service was just a bit slow. So I'm hoping they have a lot more workers on a weekend when it is actually very busy. If you are a bloody mary lover, this is also a spot for you!   I sat at the bar, and the bartender was pretty busy with having to serve the whole bar and some other tables around it seemed, so it took her probably at least 10 minutes to get to me. At least I wasn't in a hurry. I ordered a pineapple mimosa, and the fried chicken benedict.  So. Damn. Good.  This is not a place to come and have a healthy meal, but it is one to come and have a delicious one. The friend chicken benedict was probably the best meal I had during my 3 days in Scottsdale, even though I was in a bit of a food coma afterwards. Luckily my hotel was walking distance so I could walk it off a bit.  Highly recommend here for a great brunch - you have to try it!!",

We took a day trip to Phoenix so of course we had to have great food. I found this place online that offered music, food and fun! They didn't disappoint.   We opted to sit at the bar. Great choice. Service was excellent! Every bartender we encounter was GREAT! They recommended yummy options better drinks and served amazing customer service. They laughed talked and danced with us while still keeping the other customers happy!   Food was tasty we each had an idea of what we wanted to eat but wanted to try a sweet dish as well so we shared the Banana split brioche. Yes give me more! My huveous ranchos was perfect. Just enough spice, crunch, savory goodness...   So about this Bloody Mary bar! Man I am a fan and Bloody Mary aren't even my thing. So many options and to me the key to a great BM is the tomato juice. They nailed it. I was even a big fan of the mimosa flight. The pineapple was delish and my fav... orange and pineapple were fresh squeezed and it definitely makes a difference.   If I lived in Phoenix this would be my spot. Keep up the food work.   Oooh and the DJ was great.",

I decided to do brunch on a Saturday (day before Mother's Day) around 11 so as you could imagine the wait was long but reasonable.

I wasn't able to order what I wanted so I opted for the chicken and waffle along with mexicana scramble with a side of pancakes and turkey bacon.   The chicken and waffle didn't disappoint as it was flavorful although a little dry, I was satisfied with the dish. The turkey bacon however was undercooked and due to the place being busy I wasn't going to inconvenience the waiter to have it cooked crispier. The mexicana was also flavorful and satisfying but the pancakes were nothing out of the ordinary.   I also ordered the strawberry pina colada with the cotton candy on top and that was the highlight of my brunch! Super cool concept as well as a drink that was strong yet enjoyable! It's deff worth the price!   Overall this place is great just be prepared to wait. I more than likely will be back to try a few other menu items!",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Hash Kitchen when I walked in. It certainly has a fun vibe (and was packed for a weekday morning around 9:30/10). However, I soon became less and less happy with our decision to come here for breakfast.   We waited quite awhile for anyone to come fill our water- or even acknowledge us. For me, this is often indicative of future service. In this case, that proved spot on. Our waiter took a while to take our drinks -- and then wouldn't let us do our food order at the same time (we weren't sure when he would be back). I got a hot green tea and my sister a hot coffee. The tea was unbelievably weak. The hot water didn't turn any color at all until I added honey. Turns out, I was pretty much just drinking honey water the whole time (kind of gross).  Our appetizer came out - the biscuit board - in okay time. However, the six biscuits were dense like a rock and about as flavorful as one too.   Our entrees came out shortly thereafter -- I got the carne asade breakfast burrito and my sister got the chicken and waffles. Both pictured below. My sister liked her meal, although I did not. The burrito was HUGE -- way too big for a reasonable meal and I hate wasting food. To top it off, the burrito was entirely tasteless. The avocado added some flavor but not enough to enjoy the burrito. My sister also couldn't finish her chicken and waffles and found it to be way too much.  Overall, this restaurant feels more flash than substance, and I wouldn't waste time or money here.",

    "text": "I've wanted to come here for a long time. The reviews are awesome and it's close to my neighborhood.  When you walk in you're greeted by a large build your own Bloody Mary bar. Really cool if you like bloody Mary's.  They didn't seem too busy in the late morning but after 10 minutes of sitting down people were piling in. Definitely to be expected from a popular high rated place.  The amount of people seemed a lot for the servers because there seemed to be 3 or 4 employees floating around but only 1 taking orders and handling the checks. But the service was good. Our server was helping everyone and did a good job. She even took off the poutine fries because they took way longer to come out than everything else and we ordered it as an appetizer.  Which brings me to the food. I didn't realize they serve the biggest portions in the world!! I'm a guy and I eat a lot of food and I'd be more apt to complain about not leaving someplace full. This might be the only place where I'd say they could tone down the portion sizes a little bit. The food is impressive to look at. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good enough to where I'd want to comeback unless I wanted to see someone struggle to finish a plate of food. The avocado toast is on a very large impressive looking brioche. Super, super thick. Too thick to be honest. I like a quality bread that's got some texture from being toasted. Also that's warm and fresh with a little bit of chewiness to it. But also a bread that is a transportation for the amazing mashed avocado, and other great tasty ingredients. On this avocado toast it was more like a decorative hat because the brioche is a monster. I apologize for not having a pic. I also had the lasagna brunch. It sounded so good and wanted to try it as I've never had it before. It was ok. It lacked flavor in my opinion.  I think if it was my style to drink alcohol during breakfast this place would be really cool. But too much heavy food to enjoy breakfast for me.",

It took 15 minutes for us to even get our drink orders taken. Then another 10 to receive them. When our company goes out in groups we tip well. We could not justify gratuity based on the service of our server Lona. When we finished our meal we waited 30 minutes and then had to ask another person for our check. Lona's attitude and demeanor was not reflective of this establishments reputation. We will not return or recommend this location.",

We had breakfast here around 9am in order to beat the rush, this place really gets busy later in the mornings. We were seated right away which was nice but our server was terrible. She didn't pay any attention to us and we didn't get our order in until 30 mins after sitting down. She brought us coffee 10 minutes after we asked for it and I'm not joking, she filled our cups up enough for about 2-3 sips of coffee! I laughed out loud because I couldn't believe it.   Our food was good and the order was correct so that was good but then it took another 20 mins to get the check and at that point we were just upset with the whole experience.   The food and drinks are good but service was really disappointing today!",

Chilaquiles crispy not soggy, Avocado Toast enough for 2, Chicken and Waffles was surprisingly very juicy and, the Scramble was fluffy with well seasoned potatoes.They served our mimosas right away (tad on the warm side) but refreshing.

The Huevo Rancheros Hash was a large portion, that was served on a hot skillet. It was filled with cilantro carne asada meat, two eggs of your choice, I picked poached, fried onions, and a biscuit. Lots of flavors going on it one dish!  The brunch bruschetta came with six pieces. One with chocolate and banana, strawberry and cream, lastly a bacon with some sort of sweet sauce.   The prices were fair. $15 for the hash and $8 for the bruschetta.   Our wait on a Saturday afternoon was about 15 minutes. We sat outside in the nice weather. Oh the weekends they have a Dj and big speakers! So we didn't want to be in the loud restaurant. And there was a huge party of 20 as well.  Our server was attentive and polite, can't miss him!

It's a cools place and our server was from Rhode Island I believe and he was cool, but swapped with a table of more than 30 which made him never stop running around!  I had the Huevos Rancheros Hash or something close to that name... It was good, nice portion size and good presentation.   I also had the Breakfast Brushetta which is definitely just a snack! Probably not worth the $8 for it since it's pretty small but the presentation is good and would make a good addition to coffee with friends....  I met the general manager who seemed friendly while we were there. I am guessing the older lady with the super fun upbeat personality is the store manger. Everyone was friendly and I can see why this place is buzzing.   We even had carolers singing Holiday Rap Songs to us on the patio which was unexpected but amusing.

I know in my twenties that would have worked out fine for me. However, I have not been to a rave in 20 years. By the looks of it, a lot of the other customers probably don't choose Sasha or Paul Oakenfold  for their favorite either.

First time at Hash Kitchen and certain to be a long relationship. First impressions create the tone of image and mood. Miss Aimee our hostess, definitely made a positive one. Miss Aimee greets everyone as \"friends\" and although it was our genesis( it was Sunday, had to inject somewhere) her warmth was most welcoming.  The restaurant is large providing a bar area ;) and several seating areas including an outside sojourn. The day was pleasant and we elected to sit outdoors.   Our waiter Evan could not have been nicer and patient. Explaining the menu (there's lots to choose from) and making recommendations. We began with a bottle of Chandon bubbly. Excited to try a few different dishes, ordered the Herb Chicken and Waffles, Real Men eat Quiche, and Carnitas Hash. Having no \"Real Men\" around, I auditioned and got the part after 8 tries. Every Dish was different and worthy of praise; tasting delightfully delicious! Pictures truly tell a story, and I'm hoping to have captured their tasty essence. Please see Pic's.  Combining our experience from beginning to end, makes this a reoccurring must. Plenty of parking without any problem!",

I've visited this location and the one up north at Frank Lloyd Wright. I definitely prefer this location. I enjoy the upbeat atmosphere and it felt like a big breakfast party. The had a great DJ playing some major throwbacks and it made waiting for a table more enjoyable. They offer a large bar area where you may sit or stand to wait by the DJ booth which is as entertaining as it gets at a breakfast joint. If you prefer a more chilled out environment- maybe try the location up north, they seem less busy; this one is a definite upbeat spot and a great way to start a fun weekend.   Food was fantastic- definitely order the donut appetizer and the bacon board (I attached a photo) soooo good!   Will be back soon(:",

Got the Carnitas Hash with tender juicy carnitas (albeit not crispy), 2 over easy eggs, Chile verde, avocado, and piled high with fried onions - put it all together and you have the perfect bite...that I literally couldn't stop eating even though I was BEYOND full bc it was so  damn  good",

I got here around 11 in the morning and it wasn't too busy at all. I decided to sit at the bar and was greeted by the friendly bartender. I saw the Crab Eggs Benedict on one of the Yelp photos but they no longer had that item on the menu. I chose to go with the Blackened Shrimp Eggs Benedict.   I really don't eat eggs benedict too much but I thought the hollandaise was pretty good! The blackened shrimp was good and the asparagus went well with the dish. The only change I would make would be to ask for the potatoes to be crispy. I don't like soggy potatoes.   The restaurant looks pretty trendy and seems like a good brunch spot. I would definitely come back to try the other dishes.",

The bloody bar is obviously great and we did partake however these were the real MVPs: 1) the cannoli doughnuts were delicious with just the right amount of buttery sweetness and a flaky crust. 2) The blackened shrimp and grits were definitely one of the best I've had.

    "text": "Talk about brunch spots. Hask Kitchen is a place to add to your list.  The ambiance for this place is kind of \"vibey\"; think bright colors, plastic chairs and loud music. Lets just say it's young, hip and casual, with a side of turnt. The menu is vast & each breakfast selection has its unique twist on presentation & taste.   The wait can be long on weekends. Luckily we had a reservation and got a table right away.Once seated, we were handed menus and the server took our drink order. Our server was on point checking up on our table without interrupting conversations and refilling waters without us having to ask. He was also quite informative to questions and made good recommendations. The food and drinks came out within reasonable time and looked great.  As soon as we began to dig in to our food, we were interrupted by the puking of one of our table neighbors. While I'd like to say this came as a shock, it didn't. While we were hanging out waiting on our food, we noticed the girl who ended up puking was passed out on the table. Both their server and a manager approached the table as this was taking place, and did absolutely nothing about it. Let me preface this by saying she had consumed the 25oz MEGA BOBA MIMOSA and a partial mimosa flight. The manager conversed with the rest of the table, as if this girl was not drunk and passed out, and walked away. Within moments she awoke and proceeded to throw up then stumble to the bathroom. Just like that breakfast was over and we were ready for our checks, which ended up being comped. While this gesture was greatly appreciated, the situation could have been better handled.  Outside of the incident, the service went smoothly and our drinks along with our few bites of food were delightful. My only suggestion in the future would be the restaurant escort people who fall asleep at tables out, to mitigate the potential aftermath!",

The old oyster bar from Cuttlefish with the scooter seats are transformed into a Bloody Mary Bar.  Had the Build Your Own Scramble with Chorizo, Italian Sausage and Mushrooms which was excellent. It came with a small container of hash browns and a home made biscuit.  Everything was excellent,  the chorizo was just right not to hot but with enough kick to give it flavor.  The mushrooms were plentiful and the Italian Sausage was very good. The Hash Browns were good and the home made biscuit was fresh and soft.  The disk jockey playing the music was different in a breakfast / lunch place. Was good to liven up the place but at times was difficult to hear the other person talk.  The service  was excellent as our waiter Ryan made sure everything was right and for having a party of 14 he handled every need without an issue.   Was also a nice touch that the owner came by to talk with us.  Will be back to try the lunch menu and especially the burgers that looked very good on the menu",

    "text": "Very popular brunch spot in Scottsdale. Went on a busy Sunday morning there was a large number of people waiting inside as well as outside the restaurant to be seated. But there was lemonade available, drinks, and a cute Bloody Mary station for those waiting. The host advised me it would be a 35 minute wait and we had made the drive to Hash anyways, so I figured we would wait. After only waiting maybe 10 minutes to our surprise our table was ready! We had a very friendly and urgent waitress, I ordered a delicious French Press coffee and tried their cinnamon roll pancakes that were probably the best pancakes I've ever had! Sadly, the only reason keeping this from a 5 star experience was the music. It was way too loud to visit with my company and honestly enjoy a nice brunch. If the music was lowered or we visited when there wasnt a DJ would be 5 stars.",

With 40 different ways to top your drink (not to mention many flavored vodka options) you will be delirious with joy!  At only $10.00 per Bloody Mary (or $7.00 for a Virgin Mary) this is the bargain of the century! I selected homemade cucumber pickles, green beans, olives (too many olive choices to list!) pickled carrots and cucumber flavored vodka.   If you are not a fan of Bloody Mary's, don't despair, the creative menu is a dream for breakfast lovers! I can't rave enough about the fabulous menu. So many unique offerings.   I'm embarrassed to say I ordered a kale salad, (I was trying to be \"good\") which was a total wasted opportunity to try something indulgently delicious. However, next time I'm definitely getting the coconut french toast and perhaps even the leg of lamb hash! My friend ordered the pork hash and I tasted it and it was delish.   In closing, I have one suggestion: RUN over and treat yourself to a fabulous meal. You won't be sorry!",

We had the paella hash and flat-iron steak hash.  Both were delicious, generous portions.  I give this place my recommendation and was happy to hear they're opening a 3rd location in Chandler - closer to home.",

When we pulled up, there were quite a few people waiting for a table and it was packed which we thought was a good sign.  We went in to check in and get our name on the waiting list but we noticed there were some seats available at the bar.  Lucky us, we didn't have to wait!  The server at the bar quickly approached us and brought out some water.  The menu was amazing and I ordered the Paella hash and my wife ordered the poached eggs with green Chile pork and sweet corn cakes.  Both dishes were incredible.  The portions were generous and we couldn't finish our plates.  We prefer more food versus less especially when it is absolutely delicious.  If you haven't been here yet, you need to go!  The Bloody Mary bar looked awesome too.  Will be trying that next time too.  Lastly, they had a DJ keeping it lively with good tunes.  Yes, a DJ spinning during breakfast.  The vibe was very cool and alive.  Well done Hash Kitchen!",

As a foodie and a brunch fanatic I looked up some nearby places and found Hash Kitchen not only was close but had awesome reviews. So I tried my luck and of course the place was packed, good thing I was traveling solo as there was at least a 35 minute wait for a table and time is precious. I was able to snag a seat at the bar which I find the service at the bar is better and this one sure didn't disappoint. The server/bartender was knowledgeable and on point when it came to my meal and drinks. They also had a DJ which was playing great pop and hip hop hits so the vibe was definitely there. I always do bottomless but since that wasn't an option here I went for the Mimosa Flight. Awesome choice as the juices for the day were Orange, Cherry, Passion Fruit, and Blueberry.. YUM. I also had their Carnitas Hash which was delicious. I am a carnivore so I would've liked more pork in my hash but man the fried onions they topped it was were unforgettable. Needless to say I would definitely come back :)",

We had a couple of the hashes -- corned beef, and brisket with corn bread.  Both consisted of an inconvenient skillet with simple hash potatoes on the bottom.  This was topped with the meat, followed by our eggs.  There was little flavor in the potatoes (except grease), and our scrambled eggs were very overcooked and dry.  Worst were the meats.  These are not chopped into the hash but rather served on top of the potatoes.  The corned beef had a strange flavor that I find hard to describe.  The brisket was very thickly cut, extremely dry, and virtually tasteless (no smoke flavor at all).  On the good side, the biscuit and jam were good.",

Only downside is the service is a little slow at times, but not to the point where it would keep me from coming back.   I've had the salmon benedict, the stuffed french toast, a build your own omelet with crab, and the ranchero hash. Nothing bad to say about any of the dishes. Portions on most things are on the large side, so come hungry or prepared to take leftovers home. Or just roll your stuffed self out of the building.",

There's usually only a 10-15min wait on a Sat but there's no reason to make it uncomfortable to eat your breakfast. If your table has a white drape over it, it's one of the cheap folding ones that they bought so they can seat more people. The legs of the chair stops you from pushing in your chair and if you're wearing a dress, you'll have to sit with your legs to the side. I couldn't back up my chair either since I was already backed up into the wall. Other people at my table was backed up to the people next to us. Food is good but service (slow) and accommodation really lacks here. Everyone that sits on the outside was getting hit by other customers and workers as they walk by.",

Yes yes!    The carnitas hash was amazing. Perfect home made corn tortillas, fresh zesty sauce and perfectly cooked potatoes.  We also shared the lemon ricotta pancakes.  Sweet lemony flavor with just enough tartness and the ricotta made them fluffy and creamy inside. I can't think of anything they could do better.    The staff was nice, knowledgeable and helpful.

I wouldn't mind it if we could get our name on the list before we left the house, but I called ahead and they don't allow that.  So, we had to stand outside most of that time because there is not room inside or at the bar.  Really cool Bloody Mary bar, if you are into that.   Lots of things you can add like sausage sticks, meatballs, ravioli, eggs, olives, etc.  If you prefer mimosas, they have a mimosa flight.  Good size mimosas (4 of them) for $16.  Not a bad deal since they are $6 each if bought individually.  I ordered the guava, which was very good.  For food, I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were delicious, probably best pancakes I've ever had.  I would probably order those again if I come back (that is if the wait is ever less than hour or they start taking reservations).",

Cons: -The the food taste was, ok at best. We had 8 people, and 1 person said it was great, 1 said it was good, 1 said it was bad, 5 said it was OK. -Wait time longer than normal breakfast places. -Slightly high price for breakfast  We also waited 1 hour 10 minutes when they said it would be 25-30 min wait. This was on Sunday July 31 around 11 ish.  A couple things we ordered weren't as described in the menu, but not a huge deal.   I had the steak eggs Benedict, the steak was good, flavor of the rest was ok, and the eggs were not runny, yolk was hard.   So overall, this place has great potential!!  But for the price and wait and expectation, not there yet. One day when it gets better we'll return.",

    "text": "The legendary Bloody Mary is reason enough to go to The Hash Kitchen (THK), but it turns out that they serve up some awesome breakfast dishes too.  They also have a wall of fame with all the athletes and celebrities who ate here as well.  I rarely get Bloody Mary's, so I opted for the THK Bloody Mary instead of building my own.  The drink itself was spicy yet refreshing, and had a smoky flavor from bacon-infused vodka.  I enjoyed all the edible condiments: celery, bacon, pepperoni, pickles, and zucchini.  Perfect appetizers.  The sweet potato hash with lump crab meat came with two soft poached eggs and hollandaise sauce was outstanding.  My wife found it a bit rich but I like pairing egg with real crab meat.   Chicken and Waffles was another excellent dish, especially with fried leeks on top.  Waffles had bacon bits inside.  Chicken was breast only but had crispy breading and soft, juicy interior.  It rivals our previous favorite chicken and waffle at San Francisco's Bluestem Brasserie.  Solid 5 stars.  Hash Kitchen makes breakfast great again.  Perfect meal to fuel up for a day of hiking!",

The service was very fast and the menu options were simple. We got the carnitas hash, boring benedict, and classic French toast. The Benedict came with small cubes of potatoes. There's also a bit of cooked onions, tomatoes, and rosemary minced in which adds to a naturally sweet and herbal taste. The Benedict comes in two and is a decent serving. It stays True to its tradition - soft English muffins, Canadian bacon, and delicious poached eggs. There's the perfect amount of hollandaise spread throughout. It's enough to deliver a good Benedict experience. The carnitas hash is a very generous serving size for 1. It came with pulled pork, potatoes, bits of corn, avocados, sour cream, and two eggs. The dish also comes with two tortillas on the side. This was a good meal but for brunch, the carnitas hash was a bit heavy for my preference. The French toast came with powdered sugar, creamy soft butter for spread, and amazing reduced maple syrup. In general, the food wasn't bad and fairly average. The portions were spot on with some potential leftovers for later. For the price - the food experience, flavor, and texture was okay.",

The first thing we noticed is the restaurant is extra noisy and very loud. Not even to mention the loud music. The second thing we noticed is once they seat you, they forget about you for at least 10 minutes as you watch at least 10 employees walk around doing everything except service customers. The menu is eclectic with many interesting choices. I believe they have put too much emphasis on trying to have an edgy-cool restaurant/bar and should work on improving the food. We were a party of four, we each had some different, none of it was worth going back for. Especially when my Son ordered one of the Benedict's and there was a  large egg shell in his meal. No clue how one leaves egg shells in poached eggs. Also the poached eggs were cooked solid. This restaurant is more like a bar that serves breakfast. Loud, so-so food and very slow service.",

The Manager Damian (I believe that's what his name was) even came up to us to make sure we were doing good, when my Man mentioned it was our first time here he gave him his card and said next time we come in to let him know.

Most places are usually very busy in the mornings so it was no surprise that there was a 40 minute wait on a Sunday at The Hash Kitchen. It was almost exactly 40 minutes later that my friend and I got a table. We were seated in a little booth and our server came by to get our order shortly after.  I got a Mango Mimosa & the Herb Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict and my friend got the Herb Fried Chicken Hash. They were essentially the same dish put together in a different way, but the flavors were absolutely on point! I really enjoyed how crispy the fried chicken was and how well it went with the fried leeks and hollandaise sauce. The surprise was the maple reduction which enhanced/complimented all the other flavors really well!  I would definitely suggest going early or being prepared to wait for a table. If you have to wait, the good news is that they have a pretty impressive looking build your own Bloody Mary bar as well as a few different mimosa flavors to pick from ... more than I have seen at other restaurants. The food though, in my opinion, is definite worth the wait!",

Hash Kitchen was confusing, yet wonderful. It's clear that this place has the brunch game down PAT.  (+) REASONABLY-PRICED, AESTHETICALLY-PLEASING DRINKS At $16, the Mimosa Flight is pretty freaking worth it considering you get 4 full-sized mimosas to try. My friends were fans of the grapefruit mimosa!  (++) THE CARNITAS HASH HUUUUGE TASTY portion that I could not manage to finish despite my greatest efforts! The way the hash mixed with the carnitas and sweet corn, topped with an egg and some avocado....SO. UNREAL. I would come back for this dish alone.   Why not 5 stars? I wasn't crazy about the Lump Crab & Sweet Potato Hash - the portion was smaller than the other hashes and not NEARLY as flavorful as the Carnitas. The service was very attentive, but a bit slow. The time from arriving to actually paying the bill for my group of 6 girls was about 2.5-3 hours....so don't come on a time crunch!  Overall, I would TOTALLY come back, I could seriously eat that Carnitas Hash everyday!!",

We were in Scottsdale celebrating and had flown in from all over the country and wanted to catch up over brunch.   When we arrived for our 10:30 reservation, the hostess told us rudely and flippantly that there was no reservation. After much back and forth, they continued to say the mistake was on my end. I had been planning this trip for weeks and since brunch was going to be a big event during the weekend, I am absolutely certain that I had made a reservation for 10 at that location.   The staff was extremely rude, unhelpful and dismissive. They did absolutely nothing to try to remedy the situation- they didn't even offer to put our name on the wait list. The reservation \"system\" was a paper list and since I had called weeks in advance, it must have been an error on their end. Our group ended up stranded in a strip mall with no where to take our large party for a fun meal together.  Update: The owner did reach out to try to determine what went wrong and make the situation better. Unfortunately, there isn't much to be done after the fact but the follow up is much appreciated!",

In this case, Hash Kitchen made every effort to make me a fan and they succeeded.   I was invited back by the owner and I brought along my hubby and in laws. I ordered the cannoli donuts and lump crab hash. Hubby ordered the huevos ranchero hash. My mother in law took advantage of the build your own Bloody Mary and she loved it!! Father in law ordered the American scrambler. The result? We chowed down and enjoyed every bite! The in laws were raving about the taste of the food and the concept. It was by far a different experience than my first.   At the end of our meal, the owner gave us complimentary cannoli donuts even though I already ordered some. It didn't matter because my family slurped it up like it was soup. The only negative thing I can say is that when we placed our order, it took awhile to get our food (20+ minutes), but after we were done eating - my mother in law said, \"the food was worth the wait!\"   They all give Hash Kitchen five stars and so I will too!",

As the pictures are shown this is what I received and paid $16 for. This place was extremely loud looks like their main thing is there bloody Mary bar if that's what you're into looks like a pretty good place. The staff was friendly and was embarrassed of what they serve me for the value which is absolutely not the staffs fault, staff did a good job.

We were super excited to try out their unique menu and ordered two plates each. However, once we got the actual plates the food was not too flavorful and pretty bland. So disappointed because the place is fun to be around. Maybe we were there in a bad timing, because all of the reviews say otherwise.",

Our waiter, jesus, was helpful with recommendations and attentive even though the restaurant was super busy. The general manager, Linda, was very warm and professional. We enjoyed our quick conversation and really felt she cared about our experience.  We never felt rushed and nobody seemed to mind that we split our breakfast entree.....which brings me to the food. Oh my gosh, the coconut almond French toast was amazing!!!  Everything around us looked delicious too and I can't wait to come back to try the bloody Mary bar!!! Wow!",

The MYO Bloody Mary bar isn't cheap at $11, but you can choose from about six house-infused vodkas, and three mixes, and then there's a garnish bar of literally 30 items from olives and limes, to cactus and pickled eggs, to bacon and smoked cheese. The only thing missing is the de rigueur beer chaser, which our server was surprised to hear is a thing in WI.  Oh, and the food menu is great, too. Overwhelming, with too many good choices, but that's an okay problem to have. Service has always been attentive, genuine and friendly. Don't go on a Sunday if you don't have the patience to wait for quite a while. Weekdays are much quieter. Great spot, though. We'll be back!",

You can top it with all sorts of goodies and they have their own infused vodkas to give your drink that extra kick! Jalapeno lime was my choice and it was amazing and spicy.   Once you're done there, enjoy them while you get your food. The chicken and waffles are delicious. The waffle is perfect. Crispy and fluffy and flavorful. Be aware that they are topped with a lot of fried leeks (which I loved) but my BF could've gone with a little less. Which is totally ok cause then I got to eat what he didn't want. I ended up adding the leeks to my Mexican scramble because my scramble was just alright. Just imagine eggs with a mix of whatever you decided to order. I felt like it needed a little something more but next time, I'd do the crab scramble or the benedicts instead. The potatoes have great flavor and I'm torn between the flavor and then not being traditional fried breakfast potatoes. The biscuit was good but almost needed some extra butter or something. Not as moist and flaky as that perfect biscuit.   Overall, we loved it there and would definitely go back. We plan to go back in March during spring training!",

Try the Salmon Benedict, one of the Hash Skillets or the Waffles! You really can't go wrong, everything I've tried is amazing and they have the best biscuits I've ever had!

    "text": "I so wanted to like this place because it's close to my house but I unfortunately don't think I will be back. Maybe the big draw of this place is the bloody mary bar, but I went for the food and was pretty disappointed. I woke up craving a biscuit, punched biscuit into Yelp and thought I would try something new and check out this place. I ordered the eggs benedict which consists of a biscuit, hollandaise, ham, and poached eggs of course. It comes with a side of hash. The hollandaise was good and the egg was cooked perfectly, unfortunately, that was not enough to earn a good review. The hash had no crisp or crunch, it was all soft potatoes, and it came with bell peppers, which is not indicated on the menu anywhere. I have a bell pepper allergy, so automatically, I could not eat more than a few bites of my hash. I'm not going to dock points for that, because to be fair, I could have asked. However, I don't really know anywhere else where bell pepper is a standard hash ingredient. If you call yourself \"The Hash Kitchen\", you should have an out of this world hash with texture and bold flavor. Then, the biscuit was sweet and dense. I had been expecting something fluffy and savory, but it was really more like a scone which was kind of strange with all of the lovely savory flavors of the benedict. To be honest, I felt like McDonald's does a better biscuit, and that's a little sad. The service was excellent and the location was adorable, but I can't justify spending the money on really sub-par food. I shouldn't be left wishing I had gone to a fast food joint instead. It's a new place, so hopefully some changes will be made. I think they could really benefit from changing their flavor profiles up a bit, many of the menu items were basically the same thing with just one small difference. Also on Saturday and Sunday they have a DJ starting at 10 AM. Maybe they didn't realize they were in a residential area, not the Old Town bar scene?  I think the restaurant just missed the mark all around, which is too bad, that complex would really benefit from a delicious breakfast spot.",

    "text": "Wow!  We were treated so rudely by the hostess that we will never return. It was a Sunday and 2 hostesses were working.  It was the woman with the gray hair and black and white striped top.  We came in and were not greeted nicely, but told that there was a wait unless we wanted to sit at the bar.  We were happy to wait, standing patiently and quietly, looking over the menu.  After about 15 minutes the hostess approached us and said it would be another 15 minutes at least, and was not very nice about it.  There was a table set and unoccupied since we arrived, and several others waiting to be bussed.  There are lots of places to eat in Scottsdale, and if the first person you encounter in the restaurant acts like she doesn't care if you eat there or not, my feet (and recommendations to others) will patronize other establishments.",

Hot with a wonderful light and citrus flavor. I love Butterfields (biggest reason is the speed of the food) but they matched it here but with more of an upscale flair. Leo (my server) was great. You're missing out if you don't try this place. Prices are more than reasonable.",

    "text": "I was really wanting this place to be fantastic...but it wasn't. To start, we had to wait at least 30 minutes to be seated because they don't usually have seating for 6 people. Apparently they only cater to parties of 4 or less. Once seated it took another ten minutes for a waitress to come over and take drink orders. Then another 15 minutes to come over for our breakfast order. Then at least another 35 minutes to get our food. The restaurant was only 1/2 full. Once our food arrived, water glasses were not regularly filled, no one asked if we wanted another overpriced mimosa, or a coffee refill. After asking what happened to our food, a manager buzzed by asking if everything was okay, but not in a way that seemed to indicate he actually cared what our answer might be. The food was okay. Highlights were the chicken and waffle, and the yogurt parfait. The almond and coconut covered Frenzy ch toast was tasty but came with some nasty bananas. The Belgian waffles were pretuty heavy. The corn beef hash was not worth going back for. The sides of hash browns not that thrilling, either. So, they did a nice job renovating the place but it will not be there that long with such uneven service and fairly mediocre food. The Bloody Mary bar looked pretty great, but I don't think a restaraunt can really depend on that to keep the customers coming back.",

    "text": "With such great reviews, I was excited to try this place but left utterly dissatisfied.   We were seated on what seemed to be a slow day and had to wait a few minutes before we were even attended to with just water. When asked if we wanted something else to drink we said fresh squeezed orange juice, which they happened to be out of. Unsure of when the server would get back to our table and to avoid waiting any longer, we decided to order right then. We ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and the Huevos Rancheros THK Hash.   The Lemon Ricotta Pancakes came out smelling of lemon and sweetness. With that scent wafting towards our noses, we got really excited to eat. However, while it smelt so good the lemon flavour seemed more for show than for taste, as it was nonexistent whilst eating the pancakes. I love a good ricotta hotcake and this just tasted like a regular, below average pancake lacking serious flavour and very inconsistent - the first pancake was overcooked and dried whereas the second was chewy. Also, the maple syrup was not warmed it had been cooked because when you pulled it up it formed fine toffee strings, like spiderwebs which indicates it had been cooked.   The Huevos Rancheros THK Hash had the ever so slightest kick on some, not every, bite and was lacking in True Mexican flavour. The black beans seemed to be dried out and tasted of cardboard and there was an overabundance of red sauce poured over the meal.   Based on my experience, I would be reluctant to recommend.",

    "text": "I rarely write reviews of businesses - especially negative ones but today my husband and I had one of the most horrific experiences we have ever had and I am compelled to share this with anyone (especially the owner if he bothers to read reviews about his business or cares how his customers are treated!) who is considering dining at the Hash Kitchen.  I feel so strongly about the rude, embarrassing treatment we received from the General manager Linda and the owner, that I will be re-sharing this post on every social media outlet that I can to warn people about this restaurant!!!  In fact, this is probably the worst review of any restaurant I have EVER written!  I am 62 years old and my husband is 66.  We both travel extensively for business and in over 30 years of eating in hundreds of restaurants around the country, have NEVER been treated so rudely!  Please note this was not our first visit to this restaurant.  In fact, we live just a few blocks away and strongly believe in supporting our local businesses including this one!.  We are always very polite customers and typically grossly over tip and are not considered cheap or rude people.  This was probably our 15th visit to this restaurant and we have also referred other people to it!  The owner of the Hash Kitchen originally had another concept in this space named Cuttle Fish.  For reasons unknown, the Cuttle Fish concept never seemed to take hold and after a brief shutdown, re-opened as the Hash Kitchen.  They share the same kitchen with a little restaurant space owned by the same person, which was a hamburger restaurant and also has been re-opened as the Hogs & Hops BBQ.  So, here's how the story goes:  It is Sunday at 1:00.  The Hash Kitchen is busy but not on a wait list.  My husband and I decide to sit at the bar as we have often done.  We are given waters right away by the girl behind the bar (who we were later told is the bar back and her only job is to wash glasses) then we wait for 10 minutes before we finally get one of the bartenders to come over and take our drink order.  Ok, so this place has never been known for 5 star service but both bartenders have waited on us in the past and are are very polite and sweet girls.  When they bring us our drinks, we order our food.  Sounds ok so far right?  20 minutes later my waffle and bacon and my husbands scrambled eggs and sausage finally show up - again pretty slow - but we're not complaining!  Now this is where it gets interesting.  The young couple sitting next to us had ordered a side of pancakes but the food runner brought out a huge stack (full order) The couple said they didn't order a full stack and perhaps it was someone else's order.  The food runner says to them \"so , you don't want them?\" And they politely respond that they only wanted a side order.  The bartender comes back a few minutes later with the same stack of pancakes and apologizes for the confusion and tells them they will only be charged for a side order.    Now this is where the fun starts:  The couple strikes up a conversation with us - telling us that they live just a few blocks away and have been to the Hash Kitchen once before but the last time they were there, the service was extremely slow.  They said it didn't bother them because they knew it would probably be that way again but that the food was good so there they were.  My husband and I agreed with their statement and said that the servers probably should be better trained and that seemed to be a fundamental problem with most of the Restaurants that have been in that location  Linda, the GM came up behind me and asked if everything was ok.  I told her everything was fine and that's when she started harassing me saying \"Then why was I talking so negatively about their restaurant and the owner?  And to stop talking  about them to their customers!\"  I said I hadn't said anything about the owner other than he was the son of Thomaso and had owned other restaurants.   I told her my only complaint was the slow service but that our bartender had been very nice to us once we had her attention.  She called me a liar and said the staff heard me bad mouthing the restaurant and the owner and I was ruining the \"Morale\" of her people!!   Then she started in on my husband with her hands on the back of his chair, leaning over his shoulder.  He told her to please take a step back and take her hands off his chair.  Her response was 'It's not your chair.  It's our chair and we are going to tell you to leave\"!!! So we finished our meal, paid our bill and started to leave but as we were walking out the door, the owner who had been waiting for us, accosted us as we were leaving, accusing us of \"Talking smack\" about him, trash talking, and screamed at us all the way to our car!  My advice to anyone reading this is DON\"T GO THERE!!!  You can get a much better breakfast / brunch at the Twisted grove, the Vig, Butters or the Village Tavern where you will be treated with respect!",

When you first walk in, you were instantly treated to get the best bloody Mary bar in all of Arizona and a DJ spinning music to liven up in your experience. Bonnie not only greets you at the front, but makes you feel like one of the family. She is awesome, so friendly, and checks on you to make sure your meal experience is top notch. I had the herb chicken hash, my wife had the herb chicken and waffles, and the kids had a \"healthy\" stack of buttermilk pancakes to get through. The food was delicious, the portion sizes were well above average and the customer service was extremely good considering a busy Sunday morning. But best of all was the bloody Mary bar!!! Pretty much anything you could desire to be added to a bloody Mary including their own bacon infused vodka and bacon salt on the rim! What?!?! We just loved the atmosphere and will definitely be back again! The only thing keeping from giving 5 stars, just to be fair, was that some of our food came out cold. Probably due to how busy it was, but still. Friendly staff, great music and an excellent food make a great combination. And Bonnie dancing with my 1-yr old daughter to cap off the meal was priceless! See you guys next time.",

I had the smoked salmon eggs Benedict which came in two biscuits . The salmon was actually salmon chunks not the raw traditional smoked salmon and it was grilled fresh. Definitely recommend trying this place out !",

Everything from bacon to cheese and pickled everything. They custom blend to what ever you want. They even have salmon vodka. I did not go that route. We had a slightly spicy one. So good!'",

Are diners unable to socialize so they need loud music to avoid the need to talk to each other?  This is the worst example but several other restaurants also play loud music. We avoid those places.  I tried the huevos ranchero hash: it was ok but seemed more a skillet than hash. One of our guests had a scramble which was wise: it was the only dish small enough for one person to finish.  My wife and our other guest had Croque madame and said it was great. Each got through half of their portion. They should have split a plate. The lemonade was great and the coffee ok.  The server was friendly and attentive.  Food was slow to arrive.",

Oysters, cheese sticks) but still had enough to turn a drink into a small meal. We still ordered breakfast and were not disappointed. The food is good and our waiter Alec was the best. He is what took this restaurant from a four to a five star. The cons would be how loud the music was playing inside. It's loud enough that conversation can be difficult.",

The food is great, the drinks are amazing and Bonnie who was either the owner or hostess (either one she is great at her job) and Tyler the waiter made my visit worth while! I will definitely be going back until I try everything on the menu because it all sounded so good. I got the carnitas hash which was cooked to perfection!!!!",

The house bacon infused vodka is a must try...and the mimosas are fantastic.  I always get the berry one.  And they don't have a ton of juice, which is how I like them.   The food - we haven't had a bad dish here...and have been multiple times.  The Americano is my go-to for breakfast, but the lunch menu is also good.  My wife had the burger and would order it again.  Portions are substantial.    Outside the the great food and drinks - the people is what makes Hash Kitchen.  Bonnie is always there to greet you with a smile - her spunky personality is certainly contagious and a staple for the place. We have never had poor service...everyone is pleasant, efficient, and always smiling. When we have company in town - this is ALWAYS on our list for brunch.  It will not disappoint!",

I was sad not to be able to take advantage of the Bloody Mary bar, but having over indulged in alcohol the night before, I just didn't feel like I could do the experience justice.  I did order the chicken fried chicken Benedict with the hollandaise on the side. I later requested a side of the sausage gravy instead and that felt and tasted a little more like my southern roots.  Very large portions and very good.  Come hungry!   The staff were all friendly and the owner a True entertainer and ultimate hostess!!",

I can see how this place would be crazy on the weekend but great durning the week not packed but at least 10 other tables. Didn't have to wait long for anything. The pretty blonde hostess in the black and white dress was super sweet( I didn't get her name).Colton our server was helpful with what he liked cause everything sounded so good it was hard to pick(not a bad problem to have).Can't wait to come back and try the Bloody Mary bar. Big plus they have a dog friendly patio... (my dogs are to crazy and way to big to bring but little or just one dog might be okay not a huge space). Five stars after I try the drinks maybe.",

Just the food alone is good enough to secure a solid spot in my heart, not to mention the adorable decor/ambiance, fabulous service, fun drinks, and OF COURSE that Bloody Mary bar. How can you fit so many good things into one place?? Mimosa flights with fun seasonal fruits... check. Creative and delicious cocktails... check (at a brunch place! Yes!). Meatballs and ravioli and pickled eggs and whatever else my heart desires on a fully customized Bloody Mary made fresh for me... check. The menu has something for everyone, whether you're looking to carb up with a decadent French toast creation or go easy with a veggie frittata. Love! Servers are always happy to answer questions or explain the processes without being too pushy or too distant. Wait times can get nutty on the weekends but what else could you expect from a place this rad?",

I declined, never dreaming I would get ignored for another half hour lol)...with my seat and purse in view the whole time WAITING TO WAVE at a server...that never showed...Now...I'm back  in my seat  (literally yelping as i wait)and have been for a good 20 minutes working through my bloody Mary and fixins....STILL no server or order taken...Others around me have come in and gotten food...I'm disappointed....they're not even as busy as last time (earlier in the morning then)...but regardless no-one has even ASKED if my order has been taken :(...Once I'm done with this Delicious drink (bacon vodka yum) I've paid for, guess I'll go find a place to actually EAT ...",

The food will need to be better than orgasmic to make up for the idiots running the wait list.  So the manager got us a table and then paged us that it was ready!  Really!???!!?  After just telling me the pager must be broken?  And I was 5 feet outside the front door. You should have walked outside and gotten us.  So we were seated and given a complimentary bruschetta for the wait fiasco. But no plates to eat from. Seriously. Are these people actually in the restaurant biz? Max out waiter was good. But I puke disappear for long periods. Drinks took an exceptionally long time to arrive. And my extra spicy Bloody Mary was not spicy at all. Food came out super fast... and....  well. Had to be sent back. Came out a second time missing key ingredients, but I had given up by then.  Frankly the food was tasteless. I've had a better tasting has from IHOP.

As for food, their creative dishes were fantastic. However, the breakfast classics fell a little short for me. I love eggs and my veggie omelet was very bland. The Chicken and Waffles was magnificent though! The crispy onion strings on top of the waffle were amazing! I'll take a bowl of just those. The hash brown side was also yummy! It's the perfect salty side to soak up all their great cocktails!",

By the end of our meal my grandmother ended up dancing on the dance floor. There's a warm atmosphere. I had the lamb hash. The banana coconut french toast was amazing and I normally don't even like coconut. Very fluffy and hot. The lamb hash was tender and hot. I didn't get Any cheese or dairy on my hash but I will say the lamb and potatoes could use more seasoning but it was a pretty healthy option . My sister has the chicken and waffles she said they were the best she ever had. I would def come here again it's a fun place to hang out . The mimosa bar was pretty neat and the DJ made the vibe positive and fun. If you haven't been I would suggest making a pit stop here.",

The service reminds me of gals from the south - very friendly and actually look happy to be there regardless if they are or not. I went with the smores French toast and it was seriously heaven! Like if I died and went to heaven I would imagine this was at the breakfast buffet (because heaven rewards you with breakfast buffets and in heaven you don't gain weight). We also got a side of fruit and it came out on a platter and displayed nicely, very impressed. My man got the eggs Benedict and he of course gobbled it all up. Definitely swing by if you can, no regrats  (spelling intentially wrong)",

The main thing that caught my eye was their bloody Mary bar. So I knew I had to go for sure. we got there around 9 AM on Friday morning and it was already very crowded but we did not have to wait the service was great the food was delicious. I had the chorizo scrambler it was very good my boyfriend had the Carnitas hash he loved it. And finally the bloody Mary!! you go to the bar they make your drink then you add all the toppings you want in it. I put celery, carrots, olives, bacon. Yes bacon! And a hard-boiled egg sounds weird but it was so good I definitely recommend this place!!!",

Being from the UK I am familiar with bloody Mary's and this bar is phenomenal. It's a first class act. The lady in charge recognised me from previous visits and made me feel like a regular. Good service good food. Well worth the lines and wait on occasions. Came back in today and our waitress Katie was an absolute gem. She made the perfect Bloody Mary and was so accommodating towards my parents and their wishes! I had the pork Hash again and it's my favourite pork dish worldwide. So glad they keep the standard again and again.",

It's well behind OBH and Butterfield's but it is a half step up above IHOP, although my kids still prefer IHOP  A pet peeve with Hash Kitchen is that they cannot judge a wait, or, if you call in, they flat out lie. Last time I went in, I called and asked the wait. They said no wait for a party of 4. I arrived 10 minutes later, there was a 35 min wait :(  That is irritating, especially for bleh food",

The red chili was awesome and the plate didn't become an unappetizing pile of mush thanks to a crispy tortilla in the middle and the fried onions on top.  The meat that was supposed to be carne asada though left very much to be desired.  It looked and unfortunately tasted kind of like the steak they use at taco bell but sliced thinner..   My friend got the biscuits and gravy which was not very interesting.  You get like 3 lump biscuits in a pool of gravy.  Honestly, I've had better at a hospital cafeteria.  The service was pretty good.  Everyone was nice and asked how everything was.  It started getting old towards the end of the meal, maybe add in a few other lines they can say or just skip the question every other time...?  They were pretty good about refilling water and coffee, etc though so can't complain too much.   The bloody mary bar looked awesome!  We're definitely going to have to go back  one day to try lunch and the bloody mary bar.",

The dining area was very welcoming, the place was nicely decorated and the hostess was such a sweet lady. Loved her purple shoes!   My girl friend and I waited not to long for water and drinks. The Bloody Mary is a must have. Next time I'm going to be brave and attempt making a creation of my own. Amazingly they had a Bloody Mary bar aside from the full bar in the other room!   I ordered the Huevos Rancheros Hash and the red haired young gal took our order. I forgot her name. We had to 32min, yes we timed it before she took our order, the placed was not busy. We use an app that times out service and based on the wait it determines our tip! She did not score high at all :( It looked so yummy but on the first bite the meat in it was cold and had a weird taste then the sauce itself was so bland. I never send food back but this was not worth trying to swallow :( I was so sad as I LOVE Huevos Rancheros. The server did noticed and kindly suggested the pancakes so I ordered the carrot cake. Now that dish was pure heaven!!!!   Would I go back? Yes. I would try s different HASH but if that fails, I will just stick to the sweets and bloody Mary's!  I gave 4stars due to the servers acknowledgement and bringing me something yummy instead, the sweet lady up front and the kick ass blood's. Oh yeah and I have her more tip then the app suggested for her recommendation of the yummy carrot cakes.The good out weighed the bad... Please HASH KITCHEN, retrain servers on timing. Timing is of essence. Thank you ;)",

    "text": "Let's be honest, i think this is my FIRST one star review ever. I have always looked at the 1 stars at a restaurant with great reviews and now I've learned my lesson. Every review matters.  My husband and I came on Valentine's Day and were pretty excited based on the pics and fellow Yelp reviews...we will not be back.   The wait was expected 30-40 minutes in our opinion was actually really really good considering the day and the area.   We were seated at the bar as the hostess asked if it was ok, which we were fine with, give a table to a family or someone under 21. No biggie.  My husband opted for the 'build your own' Bloody Mary bar and i opted for the house/bartender makes it for me Bloody Mary, it would have to be just as good if not better than his, right? WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Ok so the hubs makes his own drink and I literally wait 20 minutes for mine. Not kidding. Then finally when she brings me my drink she then takes our order....which doesn't come out for nearly 45 minutes. No apologies, no eye contact, no how's your drink, you haven't touched but I see you sipping off of your man's.  Ok so what was wrong with it? You know when the mix isn't stirred/shaken and the good stuff is all at the bottom? Yeah, I didn't get the good stuff or the garnishes.   Kudos to the blond bartender working the other side of the bar who checked on her waiting patrons and offered to comp a drink if they would like another while they waited. I wish you were our waitress because service is half of a review.   Our food was mediocre. I had the chicken and waffles which had absolutely no flavor...the hubs had the Boring Bennie and the biscuit instead of the English muffin was actually genius.  All in all the wait For food and poor service is what this review comes down too.   **DO NOT SIT AT THE BAR**",

We arrived on a Monday morning at 11:30 and were told it would be a half hour wait despite the fact that there were numerous empty tables and not many people ahead of us. We opted to sit at the bar since we were a little pressed for time. The bartender was visibly frazzled and said they were very short staffed. I was brought watery iced tea with no straw and no sweetener and the bartender disappeared. We finally ordered and had a long wait for food which didn't look anything like the yelp pictures and was not even warm. We were told sorry for the wait but the frittata takes a long time which would explain why it was burnt and my hollandaise was dried up. Definitely an off day for this establishment!",

    "text": "Went for Saturday brunch, and was stoked the second I walked in: live DJ, hip decor, friendly staff, and a massive DIY bloody mary bar.   Then I saw the menu... and my mind was blown. A huge selection of classic breakfast favorites with innovative flavor twists and creative combinations.   My group ordered and before we knew it our table was covered in deliciously beautiful works of culinary creations.  Heaven.  Then we started eating... and it was good... don't get me wrong, but the ambiance and the flare set the bar so high that when I realized the flavors were lacking... I nearly cried.   That's the only issue... the flavors lack. Not bad. But just weak.  The Chicken and Waffles: covered in fried leeks and came with a \"bacon waffle\"... sounds awesome right? Looks awesome too. But two bites in we had to order more maple syrup to coax a little life out of it.  (Also the chicken itself was pitiful in size, but looking at other reviews it looks like we just had an off batch)  The Berries Pancakes, \"stuffed with local fresh berries\", was a regular stack of pancakes... with a spoonful of berries on top, and maybe 2 blue berries in each cake.  The Lump Crab and Sweet Potato Hash: which we were told by the waiter was one of the most popular items, was a basic hash, topped with a few peices of crab meat and two perfectly (I'll give them that) poached eggs, with a depressingly weak drizzle of aioli... good, but nothing to write home about.  The Scrambles: as good as most, the unique combo of ingredients failed to create a unique experience though. Also... the bowl of non-crispy potatoes served with them? Maybe it's the new style... but I personally would vote for a few more notches of crispy.  Anyway... i try hard to rate places on what they are, and not my own experience. For this place, I feel like they are trying to be a hip and modern eatery that pushes the boundaries of breakfast dogmas with unique flavors and creativity... that is what I experiecned, saw, and felt... but not at all what I tasted.",

It took us maybe 20 minutes to get a table which is above average for places this popular. The service was good and the food was good as well. We tried many different things and the fries appetizer with egg on top was great. There is a semi typical Scottsdale crowd here so if that's not your thing maybe this isn't the spot for you. The portions are large and pretty much everyone at our table took food home with them. I had the corned beef hash plate and it was very good. Everything was clean and the Bloody Mary bar was insanely cool. I would recommend hash kitchen to my friends and will be back once again when I'm in the area. They did good with this place.",

I tried the crab benedict, it was okay, but I thought the combination of flavors and texture didn't work for me. My friends got the chicken and waffles and the fried chicken benedict, both were really yummy!!! We also tried the cannoli donuts, those were freaking awesome! I would love to go back and try more of their food!",

    "text": "Yeah. I was so excited to try this place. I love hash.. And didn't even realize the amazing pancake options. We were greeted by friendly staff and were welcomed in the entrance with a very impressive bloody mary bar... Too bad I don't like bloody marys. Oh well. Seated. Ordered. Both of us tried hashes. I was torn between pancakes and hash, but I felt I should go with the restaurants name sake should be the item to try first. It only makes sense... But oh those pancakes... Ugh. And then it was down hill. The restaurant was pretty quiet so it wasn't like our server was overwhelmed. Literally watched the employee gossip unfold as I stared at my empty coffee cup. I dramatically drained my last tiny drop to kinda say hey.... This is a breakfast place and coffee should be free flowing.... But no. The coffee was on lock down. Hmm. Not happy. This girl wants hot coffee and without getting plenty of refill options the points drop. Then food comes out. It looks good, sounds fancy for hash, and looks like plenty to eat. Oh wait.. The biscuits that come with the meal are still cooking. Oh OK. Sounds good. Doesn't matter anyway.. I have no coffee. So it takes half a meal to get hot sauce. The biscuits were forgotten and the moment she remembered she had just picked up the coffee pot and I thought my dreams were coming True... Then she put it down to go get biscuits. Basically my hash was lacking the flavors the menu described. I finally was able to get more coffee at the last bite of my meal. I didn't eat meat if my potatoes because they were bland. And the biscuits... No butter. No jelly or jam. They had a sweet light coating on them... But it wasn't enough to make me want to eat the. I was pretty disappointed. However I will probably go back one more time to try for better service and the pancakes... Because they do sound good. Hopefully round two will have some kinks worked out.",

The bigger thing is once you finish the make an overt effort to get you to leave.. very embarrassing for the employees and the manager who show up at your tase trying to take even more stuff off to get you to leave.

I came here with a friend but we had to split the entree because we were so full from the Bloody Mary bar (the jalapeno poppers are bomb at the bar are bomb). Overall, this place has delicious food. I'd definitely come back to try other brunch items on the menu. The biggest downside to this place is probably the noise. This place was popppin with a DJ and very loud people. This wouldn't normally bother me but I could hardly hear my friend sitting across em so if they toned down the music just a bit, it'd probably help. The service is a bit slow but expected because this place is so popular. The servers were also really friendly so we didn't mind the slow service as much. Also, we were told the wait time would be 2 hours by but it was only 20 min so that was awesome! Other than that, the overall environment/look of this place is pretty awesome.",

I tasted all he kids plates and pancakes and thought it was ok nothing that great and honestly pretty forgettable. Even the coffee tasted strong and bitter. Food took forever and service was lousy barely checked on us. I was gonna ask for the cojita cheese myself to put on my chilaquiles but no one bothered to check on us or ask if we needed anything. They removed it from our bill and the bitter coffee too and our bill came to $70 for 5 people. Music was a bit loud felt like a nightclub scene. It's great for a young college, single crowd not so much families with kids.",

Their cocktails were even more impressive as they had an impressive offering of various mimosas and their Bloody Mary bar was gigantic! The passion fruit mimosa was by far my favorite although the grapefruit was a close second. There was a great bacon app that we started with and had a bunch of thick pieces of bacon seasoned a few different ways. I ordered the money cristo sandwich and it was by far one of the tastiest things I've ever had! The park ales were huge as well. Another one of us ordered those and they filled up the plate with a stack of 4 pancakes! The atmosphere was awesome and put off a great vibe. I've heard there is also a DJ over the weekend so we'll just have to keep coming back to take in the full experience. Hopefully they open up many more!",

We were told that it'd be about a 25-30 minute wait but they actually got us in within 15 minutes. The place was packed, lots of people and the DJ was loud but in a fun way. We ordered the Paella Hash and the Breakfast Cannelloni. Both had good flavor but i'd probably pass on the paella hash. Although tasty, it wasn't what we were expecting. The Breakfast Cannelloni was superb though. Good place to try, I'd probably be back again once I try other brunch spots.",

The waitress said we don't have any gluten free menus, they \"were never printed.\" Since it's called HASH kitchen, I figured I'd try one of their hash skillets. It comes in an individual cast iron skillet with potatoes on the bottom and an egg on top. It started out very good, however all the potatoes that were touching the cast iron tasted just like hot fish! Yuck! I suspect they use the same skillet for something with fish or crab in it. That strong fishy flavor ruined the dish. They should reserve skillets just for those orders. The cannoli donuts also were friend in oil not reserved for a sweet donut. You could taste savory flavored foods that were fried in the same oil on the outside of the donuts. Tasted like fried onions. My coffee cup had old lipstick from other patrons on the outside. I really wanted this place to be good. The photos of their food look so enticing! Too bad. I hope they change some cooking procedures in the future because it could be good.",

    "text": "First time at The Hash Kitchen.  We love trying different breakfast places on the weekends but they are limited on who allows dogs.  My wife had been searching and found this place and she knows I love my hash.  We took our dog to the dog park on Sunday morning at Chaparral Park and then went over to the Hash Kitchen at Gainey Ranch.  We arrived around 9am with a few people waiting and requested a table on the patio.  Our wait was very short and we were seated.  Our waiter was out quick to greet us with water and to find out what other beverages we wanted.  I guess they are popular for a Bloody Mary Bar but we aren't drinkers so we went with a very bold house coffee. When he returned with our coffee he answered questions that we had regarding the various items on the menu placed our order.    A wonderful lady by the name of Bonnie stopped by our table to see how we were doing and to check if we needed any thing.  After Bonnie realized it was our first time here she shared some of the other wonderful items that are favorites of the regulars.  She sent out a complimentary order of biscuits and jam which was wonderful with our coffee while we waited for our food.  I ordered the Leg of Lamb Hash and my wife had the Carnitas Hash.  Wow!  So much flavor in both dishes and plenty of food for us to share with each other.  My Leg of Lamb was so tender and rich over the potatoes and was topped with 2 poached eggs & fried leeks.  The Carnitas was mild in spice but full of flavor which is totally fine with wifey.  Shes not a fan of spicy hot and was hesitant at first to get this but our waiter explained that the Green Chili Sauce Crema was tomatillos based and just a small amount of chili's is added.  We really enjoyed both and decided we will be making plenty of future visits here to try many of the other options on the menu.  Bonnie stopped by again to see how everything was and I have to say that all of the staff is very friendly and accommodating.  Only one complaint; talk to Waste Management company to schedule a different time of the week to empty the dumpsters.  A distraction from what was a wonderful morning on the patio enjoying a great meal - see you soon!",

We shared the breakfast cereal cocktail flight, and I also had a White Russian. My wife and I shared the veggie frittata and some pancakes. Perfect balance of sweet and savory. Staff was super friendly. The bartender thought she made my drink too strong and came over to offer to remake it. Our waiter was great and made sure the water and coffee was fresh. Great brunch environment and I'd highly recommend.",

We had a group of 4 and came in around 2pm for Sunday brunch - luckily there was no wait for an outdoor table. We ordered the mimosa flight, which I strongly recommend; it came with 4 generous portions of pineapple, blueberry, strawberry and orange mimosas.   We ordered the lemon ricotta pancake as a starter which was light, not too sweet and delicious! We also ordered the hash huevos rancheros with the huevos on the side and without the meat. Also ordered the impossible burger with a side of fries. The presentation for both were promising! However, the hash huevos rancheros tasted bland and was overpowered by the number of potatoes in the meal. Really wish they had added a more flavorful sauce/salsa/guacamole to make this more tasteful  especially considering that hash is their main product.   The impossible burger, on the other hand, was delicious! Overall, I enjoyed the mimosa bar and the lemon ricotta pancakes but was not thrilled by the hash.",

    "text": "Tasty breakfast fare at Hash Kitchen.  In town for a few days, and up very early on East coast time, stopped in at Hash Kitchen. There were only a few tables taken, and we were promptly seated outside.  This location is free-standing in outdoor mall. Outside seating is along the side and the back of the building, so you can sit in full sun or in the shade.  Our server, Matthew, did great work. He explained the menu, food delivered as ordered and kept our coffee and iced tea full, plus offered a couple of iced teas to go. Thank you!  Seems like if you go to Hash Kitchen, you have to try.... The hash!  Mine was served in a cast iron skillet atop home fries and topped with a pair of sunny-side up eggs. The hash was good, if unimaginative - diner style with diced corned beef and potatoes, seared to a crisp crust on the griddle.  Eggs perfect with plenty of yolk for dipping. Home fries were crispy, but needed some peppers, onions and spices to pump them up.  This was good, but for $14 at a place called Hash Kitchen I was expecting something  more creative.   The chicken tinga was excellent.  A fluffy moist fritatta is covered with shredded chicken simmered in tomatoes, chipotle chilis in adobo, and sliced onions.  This was garnished with a big slice of avocado, cotija cheese, sour cream and cilantro.  With a dash of Tabasco, this is a mouthwatering combination.  Food here is good. The tab was $40 with coffee so too expensive for everyday breakfast.  Other things to try on the menu.... I'd go back.",

Besides the fantastic doughnuts I have ordered salmon eggs benedict but they tasted weird.. instead of a traditional English muffin they were served on a very hard sweet kinda scone.. I could not eat that.. our server was kind enough to take it back.. we also ordered the mimosas.. tasting ok but the fruits they were decorated with have seen some better days.. the strawberry looked dehydrated.. and none of it was fresh  Place was packed and I think i have seen only one server.. it was a mission impossible to provide a decent service.. even though our waitress was very sweet and nice we waited for our food almost an hour..  in overall it wasn't a bad experience but I don't think I will be going back anytime soon",

I tried the Mimosa flight and impressed the blueberries actually bobbed!  The orange and pineapple were fair and the strawberry was tasty.   Hubby loved his biscuits and gravy and I enjoyed the fried chicken Benedict.  They infuse all of their vodka which is the bomb. Hubby was not a fan of the bacon infused and didn't love the Bloody Mary, but the original hit the spot.   Will try the other locations and give the Bloody Mary bar a shot next time!",

We came early on a Sunday morning (at 8 AM) and it was the perfect time because it wasn't too packed yet! It was pretty full though, so I would suggest coming earlier than later. I assume they get a pretty crazy wait as the morning goes on.  Of course, we had to partake in their famous Bloody Mary bar. You go up to the special bar, pick a vodka (I got jalapeno), pick a salt rim, pick a mix type, and then fill 'er on up with all the goods! They have LOADS of pickled veggies (my mouth is watering just typing this), cheeses, meats, peppers, you name it - they've got it. It was SO yummy! If you're a Bloody Mary fanatic like me, this will literally make all of your dreams come True.  For my entree, I got their pretzel benedict which was lathered in beer cheese hollandaise. Um, WHAT?! So. Dang. Good. Yeah, it was probably my week's worth of calories but oh so worth it!  This is such a fun spot to come with a group or if you're REAL hungry for a hearty breakfast. Our server was also quick and super friendly. The food came out fast and hot! I can't wait to come back again and am super excited for their Arcadia location to open.",

The layout inside is bright and open which we enjoyed; the bar was beautiful and the table settings gave it a subtle elegant feel. We got a flight of mimosas - lime, strawberry, kiwi, and orange. I loved the strawberry and enjoyed the other three as well. I believe the juice used in each was fresh which was a nice touch. To eat I got the hash with tons of crispy friend onions over chicken breast. The chicken and onions were tasty! There was quite a bit of oil though, but it wasn't to heavy. It is definitely enough food for two meals which I liked. My sister got the frittata with Italian sausage and found it bland. For the price I think I'd consider other places for brunch but I enjoyed my meal.",

The variety of drinks from mimosa flights to adult Capri suns to mini disco balls to cereal shots certainly keeps things entertaining. All the drinks were pretty reasonably priced as well.  As for the food, I think the portions were spectacular. I got a hash brown stack eggs Benedict and was very satisfied by the amount of potatoes I ate in the span of two hours. You'll definitely have enough to take home for leftovers as well. All in all, 9/10! The only complaint was the misters weren't quite facing the right direction and as a result, sitting outside in the Arizona summer was a bit painful.",

The Bloody Marys were wonderful. My friend also ordered some cereal milk shooters, which were good as well. The food was as good as you expect for a good brunch place.

    "text": "Now I completely get why Hash Kitchen has over 2k 4.5 star reviews! It's rare that you find a brunch spot that has a quality food, hip and trendy flares and impeccable customer service.  The Build Your Own Bloody Mary Bar was of course a huge influence in my choice to visit Hash Kitchen. It was even better than I imagined. Hash kitchen infuses their own vodka with flavors and you get to choose what flavor you would like along with the rim flavor and level of spiciness (mild, Med, hot). The menu is a mix of creative apps and entrees. I had trouble deciding what to order so I turned to Yelp reviews. I landed on the Cannoli Donuts and Cristina's Tamale Cakes. Since I don't eat red meat the server suggested replacing the pork with avocado. It was absolutely delicious! I would definitely order that dish again.  The table next to mine ordered the breakfast shooters. They looked like so much fun and were very decorative. If I get the chance to go back I will order them! Caution: If you are looking for a laid-back quiet family breakfast, Hash Kitchen is not for you. They play hip club like music at a higher level and encourage a young fun crowd. The cost for my entire meal plus the Build Your Own Bloody Mary it was only 40 bucks, extremely affordable!!",

We order the poutine corned beef hash and split because we planned on a \"dessert\" French toast.  Service was awesome. Danielle was our server she was very accommodating and we did not feel rushed at all. The bartender from the Bloody Mary bar stopped by and asked us how we liked our drink. She was also great , Dee. Very friendly very clean. Just ordered our dessert holy Toledo.. so so good. I'll be back. The only thing I wish is we had one in R.I..",

There was about a 30 minute wait but we walked up to the bar and ordered bloody Mary's. They have tons of Bloody Mary options (Classic $10, Bloody Mary bar where you choose your toppings $13, and various flavored ones that come in a bag and are named after blood types). They also have flavored mimosas and a mimosa flight that seemed really popular. They have tons of food options (mainly brunch but also lunch options). We ordered the avocado toast and it was HUGE. It looks like it's made for a giant. It was covered in delicious braised pork and bacon jam with a green chili hollandaise on the side-highly recommend! The portions are definitely big enough to split and the bloody Mary's are practically a meal in itself. Our server, Matthew, was great! We probably won't come here regularly because it's loud and the meals and drinks are heavy but we'll definitely bring friends and family here, especially when visiting from out of town! I highly recommend you check this place out!",

    "text": "A couple of weekends ago we finally tried The Hash Kitchen . I had had this place on my bookmarks for awhile as I love the owners/ management who also happen to operate The Sicilian Butcher , ( a favorite!, in PV); Tomaso's, ( another favorite ) and Tomaso's When In Rome. I'm posting because some of it we loved .. and some of it .. we didn't. You should be the judge! Maybe we are just old!  The vibe was a bit like a day club.. BUT.. with breakfast !  As there was a DJ booth and a bar in the center; complete with spinning silver disco balls .. IT.WAS.LOUD. It made us wonder what age group The Hash Kitchen is attempting to lure in. My husband and I don't consider ourselves completely 'old' .. But GOOD grief ! I want to eat brunch with maybe less EDM at the loudest volume you could find on a weekend morning. You almost had to shout the order to the waitress. We didn't find it busy on this particular weekend day.. and that in itself, was odd for this area. We were served water with lemon right away; a mimosa ; and coffees..  the waitress was attentive UP until we ordered the food. Our starter , a Salmon Charcuterie Board , ( really good , btw !) and main , ( Huevos Rancheros Skillet , which was tasteless) , came out together. We wanted the charcuterie board as a starter ... as it's called? Again, having found the Huevos Rancheros Skillet , ( we shared this ), tasteless and it had these awful crispy , greasy fried onions on top; the poached eggs we ordered over easy to top the skillet  , were done, NOT over easy. We were brain storming to pep' up the taste and could not get our waitress back to our table for anything. It's a little bit of a pet peeve when food is delivered by a runner and the waitress doesn't come back in a few moments to check to see if it's actually to your satisfaction. Well.. this was the case , and they were not busy and seemingly had all these waiters hovering around. We asked for sour cream and salsa , when she finally came back .. probably 15 minutes later. Then another 8-10 minutes later she came back to tell us she had NO actual salsa but came with a bottle of Cholula sauce and no sour cream either. The waitress said they had 'crema' and we said that would work... BUT, again, she didn't return with the crema. We asked for the bill.. and when she asked if all was okay.. well , I said .. no. But, in the fashion of some millennials .. she didn't seem to care. She said with a half smile , 'Oh.' Hands us the bill and we left , unimpressed. . Our waters had gone dry. My mimosa was great ... but also .. now empty.. with no care or concern from the waitress. So unlike the other restaurants in this group that owns The Hash Kitchen .. this left anything but a great taste in our mouths. Return factor? meh. Too loud on the music  ; Too few on the care decibels.",

If you're in that position this place was more like a 3 as you can mostly only have the scrambles and frittatas. The kitchen/manager were a little uncomfortable when they found out I was Celiac. Otherwise most of the food looks amazing and probably is around 4.5 stars.  We came here for brunch and got the bacon board. That was very good but without actual gluten-free bread to put it on was just a lot of bacon. My wife loved it with the mini bagels they brought out.  My wife also got a Bloody Mary which looked amazing.  I ordered the Sicilian Frittata & my wife ordered Mexicana Scramble. I really enjoyed the frittata and my wife said the scramble was like most everywheelse, solid, not bad. I would mainly be cautious with their gluten-free designations if you're allergy or intolerance is sensitive as most share a fryer or are cross-contaminated in some way. They did the frittata in a clean pan which was very nice!  We will definitely come back with friends!",

We looked at online reviews and stumbled upon Hash Kitchen. We are pretty picky about our food units and restaurants and wanted something unique, good vibe and great service. HK certainly lived up to that. We sat outside side and the service was great. They were serving their Holiday menu and it was great. You definitely need to try the Cannoli donut. We shared it with our entire table! I had French toast with caramelized bananas. We didn't visit the Bloody Mary bar, but it looked amazing. We opted for mimosas instead. The music wasn't loud and allowed us to enjoy our conversation. The shopping center was also very nice; clean and modern. If I lived in Scottsdale, I'd eat breakfast here all the time. We will definitely be back the next time we are in the Valley of the Sun.",

I noticed she was touching base with other tables as well. & i think that's so important & shows that the manager cares ! I've been to plenty of restaurants where you never see a manager & its nice to see one that's involved! It's also such a cute place & great environment for a brunch spot !

I vowed never to go back, but my wife has been with her friends who think it is great on 3 more occasions, and each time she has come home saying it was a terrible breakfast.  So I cannot understand the attraction to this place.  If you want a great breakfast, and we've been to them all, try the Breakfast Joynt or Cafe Paris both in Scottsdale. The Breakfast Joynt has the best bacon, eggs benedict, and swedish pancakes in town. Cafe Paris, near Costco, has the most incredible French crepes I have ever had!!",

We arrived and immediately were greeted by super friendly staff. The restaurant has lots of space including indoor and outdoor seating options.   We opted to order the order the mimosa flight. So awesome! And such a great deal if you are a fan of mimosas. Just perfect and the presentation makes it even better. The hash options seem endless.

The waiters/waitresses are awesome, nice and they are always in good spirits.   I always come on the weekend. There is a Dj here who definitely makes the atmosphere worth while!!   Go.

Bonnie's effervescent personality is such a great entertainment, as she is so sweet and bubbly. She is human champagne!!

I would come back just to hang out with her if for no other reason. Their bloody Mary bar is out of this world and the best $10 I have ever spent. I mean it is a meal in itself, and the fact that they let you go back to top off your toppings is awesome. If you like spicy, definitely get the jalapeno infused vodka with the hot sauce. OMG delicious! My actual meal was not all the great to me. I ordered the lump crab and sweet potato hash and unfortunately it had no flavor. The hash could definitely been cooked a little longer because parts of the sweet potato chunks were still raw. The lump meat was bland and the portion was ok for the $14 I spent on the meal. I just wish it had more flavor. The biscuit however was pretty tasty. Not sure why my meal was so lackluster, but because of the the service, the company I was with, the bloody Mary bar, and that fabulous hostess will definitely earn a repeat trip.",

We had the the hash, eggs bennie, biscuits and gravy and bacon. The bacon was amazing! The brisket hash was good, not great (needed seasoning badly), my wife said the eggs bennie was not that good. She said the hollandaise sauce lacked flavor and seasoning and was quite bland. I would say that this is an issue other yelpers have noticed but it doesn't seem that the chef is reading these reviews. I did speak with the server about the issue directly so hopefully it will finally get address. This place could be amazing, but right now they are just 3/5. Service was 5/5.

However, the staff was either over attentive, or extremely under attentive. We waited about 10+ minutes to place our drink order after sitting down, we then waited a long time for our drinks, then the food came and almost every staff member came to our table asking how the food was (4 different people). Then we had no service for 20 mins when we needed refills on our drinks. The servers need some lessons on how to monitor a tables needs. They clearly didn't know when was a good or bad time to check in. For the prices and atmosphere of this place, the service needs to step it up.",

The deejay playing great music made you wake up.   There was a large assortment of menu items that I didn't know where to begin. We started with the little doughnuts. We ordered both the Canolli and the Nutella.  You don't need to try both. The Nutella is all you need to try.   For breakfast I tried the waffle with fried chix and thought it was just ok. My husband had the lump crab cake Benedict and enjoyed it. Overall, our table enjoyed their meal and was stuffed.   A Yay for you to come and experience this fun place!",

They also have a massive Bloody Mary bar that has everything thing you could think of along with tasty Mimosa flights. The decor and atmosphere is very lively and modern.

We have a toddler who we take with us every weekend to brunch and this place so far takes the cake on a wait so it's a good thing she's a trooper. It was also a bit loud. I personally love live music so I wasn't a fan of the dj. It's a bit of a brunch after a night out place which is great if you dont have kids. Hoping the new location by our house is a bit more family friendly cause we do love the food and people. I was a big fan of their biscuits. This place does have good things going on but try to get there before the late brunch crowd.",

I had a few hard shell pieces that made its way into the crab meat, but it wasn't a big deal.  I wasn't a big fan of their hollandaise sauce so I'm glad I had it on the sauce.  Overall, it was good but I found the biscuit to be quite heavy for the pairing.  The poached eggs however were great.  Their breakfast menu is very extensive (I had a hard time deciding between sweet or savory!) and portions are generous.  Their decor is very nice (open, clean, modern) and staff are upbeat and friendly.  The owner comes around and chats with the patrons which I always welcome because it adds a personable touch.  This place seems to be a local favorite.  I hope to get another chance to go again and try their other items.",

I had a build your own scrabbler and my friend had a chicken enchilada type dish.  Both of us barely ate any of the food because it was bland and had ingredients that did not mesh well together at all.  The waiter took back our plates and didn't even ask us if anything was wrong even though most of the food was left on the plate.  The portion sizes for most of their dishes is small.  And finally we got the check and were shocked,  it was $40 for the two of us.  They charged $5.25 for a large orange juice that was barely 8oz and my scrambler was $12 for hardly any food.

    "text": "When I saw the Hash Kitchen on the Arizona Breakfast Weekend list, I decided it was time to finally make my first visit.  The Hash Kitchen is co-owned by chef Joey Maggiore and his wife Cristina Maggiore of Maggiore Culinary Concepts (who also own Tomaso's Italian Restaurant and Tommy V's Osteria Pizzeria). They seek to \"reimagine breakfast classics with creative remixes\". This location is located in the beautiful Gainey Ranch area. The atmosphere was very inviting right when we first walked in as several people welcomed us before we were sat (we didn't wait long either). Their popular build-your-own Bloody Mary bar (claimed to be Arizona's largest) with their many garnishes and bacon-infused vodka is the first thing you see as you walk in. The bacon on a stick was calling to me as I passed by it. To start off, each of us in our party ordered a specialty coffee drink. The breakfast week menu consisted of an entree, a classic mimosa and a cannoli donut. The donut was a nice little treat to pair with my coffee and comes fried to order. I ordered the Carnitas Hash - a cast-iron skillet filled with potatoes, roasted corn, tender pork carnitas, avocados, two eggs and a heap of crispy onions (and a couple of corn tortillas). It had a nice hint of spiciness and was just as good as it sounds. The portion sizes here are pretty generous and I had plenty to take home to eat later. Overall this was a pleasant experience and I hope next time to partake in the Bloody Mary Bar. I'm excited to check out their Chandler area location (down the street from me) when it opens.",

Only negative is the mimosa had more juice than sparkling wine/champagne. The day we went they had a live DJ with loud music. It would have been nice to have different type of music.",

We waited forever and they either gave us a broken buzzer or skipped our turn even though we were waiting right by the front door. When we said something they sat us at the worst table right at the entrance then never came back to take our drink order. The 2nd time was this past Monday, the restaurant was completely unoccupied except for one older couple. We asked to turn the music down and they refused. It was still 7am and the absolute lack of customers made the empty room even louder with the echoing of the blaring music. You're not that cool! Turn the music up when people actually show up or something so it isn't amplified in your empty cave of a restaurant. There are way too many places to get a wonderful breakfast around Scottsdale/Phoenix/Tempe to have to settle for poor service. It's sad to see when a business starts thinking that it's so great that it stops caring about everyone. Next!",

We were all starving so we were looking to order asap. But for some reason, we sat for 15 min w out anyone coming over or even pouring us water. So that was a little disappointment especially since the restaurant was not packed at all. Eventually our server came over and we started ordering. I got the Bloody Mary since you can make your own n my other two friends raved about this new brunch spot so I was very looking forward to it! I love the Bloody Mary bar! You can add so many different things!! I added beef jerked, jalepenos, jalepeno olives, pickes, salami, celery u name it!! My friend and I both ordered the huevos ranchero hash while my husband ordered the corned beef hash. And my girlfriend and her kids ordered the flat iron steak hash and the Oreo pancakes. Oh and I got a side of bacon! I enjoyed my huevos ranchero hash but I was expecting my hash potatoes to be more like hash browns, thinly chopped and crispy. But they were more like bite size potato pieces and they weren't that crispy. I took a bite of everyone elses' dishes and they were all very good. Next time for me, I don't think I would order the hash dish again. Too many potatoes for my taste. But overall everything was good. And I finished it off a strawberry mimosa!! Yum!!",

The eggs are tiny and were gone in a couple bites.  Maybe the other food was better, just don't get the skillet!   The server didn't even ask how I liked my food. I really hated it. He didn't even ask when I ordered a second entree....but he did try to rush us out while we were still eating lol. No I don't need a box if I'm still using the fork to put food in my mouth.   On the upside though - the place is really cute. The bloody mary bar looks super cool and has a ton of topping, but the toppings all taste like perfume. Only the celery and olives were good lol The mimosas are super cute and worth it. The cereal shooters looked delicious. Basically, go to drink or order basic food like waffles or pancakes.",

I don't remember her name but she had a short hairstyle and is from Michigan!   I got the mimosa flight (which two of the four weren't that good) and the steak burrito!

I mean, for the amount of people descending on this place on a Sunday morning@11am in the middle of a hot and humid July day, you would think the food would be outstanding. Their menu, while pretty big, is basically all the same. Potatoes with eggs, potatoes with beef, potatoes with veggies...and it wasn't all that delish, but not horrible either. I'm just saying, it's not worth the wait.  The restaurant is trendy, I guess...lots of pretty people and very loud music with a live DJ. As loud as it was, there were people there from age 2 to 90.   So, the main reason we went, was the you guessed it,  Bloody Mary bar! So disappointing! First off, the Bloody Mary just didn't taste right. It had a strange grainy consistency. The bar was a great idea, but the food and veggies were hard to get on the sticks. The tongs were too small and flimsy to grab things like the olives and pickles.  It Just made for a  big old \"bloody\" mess. If the food and veggies had been tastier and fresher, maybe it would have been a better experience.  Service, music and vibe were really great. So were the prices, but the food and Bloody Mary's didn't excite me. Off to find another place for Sunday brunch.",

If you are inside it is very hard to hear the person next to you. But I think it adds to the vibe. So I get it. Just something to consider.  2. When we arrived they said it would be a 40 min wait. So we stood outside (next to the door). After about 35 mins and seeing people who came after us get seated, I decided to ask where we were in line. The girl said, \"we buzzed you a few times\". I said that's weird buzzer didn't go off. She rolled her eyes and had it go off. Of course it worked. Another girl next to her said don't go far this time. They did seat us pretty quickly after it. BUT I did t appreciate the eye rolls or the attitude. Also... pretty sure it happen to at least two other groups while we were waiting...",

The website indicated bacon as a main ingredient topper but it was not an option when we got there, however, upon request it was available...had we not asked one would've never known.   For breakfast we had the carnitas which is apparently the top favorite of restaurnnteers and the corned beef hash. The flavor was spot on but we were left feeling...where's the beef! We dug into the excessive amount of potatoes only to find more potatoes, the amount of meat with each dish missed the mark.   I'll be back only after I check out other Bloody Mary bars in Scottsdale, may not be for a while but I'll be back. The vibe was positive and the DJ was spinning some great mixes. Be warned...wait time can be up to 45 minutes and for good reason!",

The over the top bloody mary bar, the flights of mimosas or cereal shot flights are outstanding.  The food was great also, with one caveat.  I ordered a pancake on the side -and it came out raw (full of batter) in the middle still.  The waitress apologized and brought a new one, but not much else was said about it.  That said, the second pancake was great and light and fluffy as they should be.   I would have rated 5 stars, but knocked one off for the undercooked pancake (c'mon now, it's a pancake it's not rocket science to tell when it's done).  Still, it was a great place and I enjoyed myself enough that I'll definitely be back.  I'll just make sure to double check everything has been fully cooked. :)",

The food however left much to be desired. Their crispy potatoes were the highlight, fresh and flavorful. I also purchased the lump crab Benedict along with biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were very dry and old tasting and the lump crab Benedict/biscuits were not even fully covered with sauce.   My advice to the chefs: don't be so conservative with the sauce on the egg benedict. At the very least assure the biscuits are covered with sauce.   I would have given 4 stars as the location, atmosphere, staff and crispy potatoes were all very good, however, when the aforementioned meal cost $25 plus tip I would have been more satisfied going to a handful of other breakfast establishments.  Update:  My wife and I came back after the encouragement of the owner, Joey. The food was over-the-top good and fresh. The portions were bountiful and as previously mentioned, the atmosphere, staff and location are hard to beat. 5 stars! We look forward to coming back again in the future!",

I felt a bit out of their age range - we came for brunch with a baby and wanted to have a conversation, but the DJ was blasting music way too loud inside. So we had to sit on the patio (thanks for misters, made experience tolerable), but still the tables were too close together and hard to be comfortable with a stroller. So the ambience of the place was hard to embrace, hut if I were a college student, I would be thrilled!   Now, the drinks... we went for Bloody Mary bar with all 45 toppings - that's an experience, who cares about the Mary when you get to put an egg and a meatball on top?  This is the experience to come back for!!! also ordered mimosas, but those were underwhelming - barely bubbly and flavor just wants there.   Food is good, but not excellent that I would want to be back to have it. Salmon bennies were good, but the poached egg was a bit over cooked for my taste, but the biscuit and hollandaise we're great. Everyone else was happy with their build your own scramble, salmon frittata and some another frittata with chicken.   Overall - I'll be back only to share the Bloody Mary bar with some guests visiting Phoenix, otherwise some other brunch place",

It took 10 minutes for service to come to the table, and the food took a little while longer than normal to come out.  Also, the music was so loud it was hard to hear or hold a conversation across the table.  We keep coming back for the food, but the service hasn't changed!",

With that being said, we were happy to find Hash Kitchen. The reviews were good and I saw they had a mimosa flight .   Even though it was crowded, we were promptly seated. This place is lively. A DJ, TVs playing, lots of people both inside and outside, people making the craftiest Bloody Mary's at the huge Bloody Mary bar. I mean, they were putting everything from celery to mini cheeseburgers to ravioli on their Bloody Marys.   I ordered the huevos rancheros. They were delicious. The tortilla chips were fresh. The chicken was well seasoned. My friend got a cheeseburger and the other 2 in our party split the hash and a fruit board. They give you A LOT of fruit. They did not lie when they said board. The fruit was good too. Nice and sweet. Everyone liked their food. They messed up my friend's cheeseburger sour had to be remade. Outside of that, the food was good all around.   Their portions are HUGE. We looked at the tables around us and the French toast were like half a loaf of bread. Lbvs. It looked delicious though.   I love their coffee mugs and I wanted to buy one but they were sold out. So I asked my waitress if they ship them...they don't . I love a nice big coffee mug and theirs was a cute matte black. I'm determined to get one of them now. Lol.   The only downside to Hash Kitchen was the loud music. Don't get me wrong, I loved the DJ. She was playing some good music. However, it was sooooo loud that you couldn't hold a conversation. I could barely talk to the person next to me and I didn't bother to talk to the person across the table. We had a hard time speaking to our waitress too.   If you want a fun brunch with some good food, go to Hash Kitchen.",

    "text": "I reviewed Hash Kitchen 3 years ago, and decided to do another review/update. This is definitely the breakfast place you should go to when you have family/friends in town. It has a definite wow factor to it. The only reason I am taking it down to four stars is because living in the area for a while I prefer going to more standard traditional breakfast places. Hash has a really funny twist to its menu which helps the wow factor. I really prefer just a good old standard eggs bacon and pancakes from a place like butters. I frequent hash kitchen primarily when we have people in town so they can see the bloody Mary bar, have a mimosa flight, DJ playing on weekends, etc... I ordered the carnitas this time. The flavors were tasty, but it needed another egg in it. Kids ordered s'mores pancakes. They look pretty decadent, and of course the kids liked them.",

My favorite dish was probably the Mexican-style omelette and the fried chicken hash. I had a few bites of the lemon ricotta pancakes and that was tasty too, but it's a huge portion so it felt very heavy. Come hungry!

We made it to the restaurant at around 9am and only had to wait ~15 minutes to get a table for 3. For how packed it was, we were shocked by how quickly we were able to get seated, AND how fast we were served our food... It was almost unsettling how quickly our food came.   Overwhelmed by all of the options, we opted out of the build your own Bloody Mary bar, and just ordered basic B.M's and an order of the cereal shooters to share. I still can't decide if I loved them or hated them... but am so glad I got them - I'd highly recommend. We thought the Cinnamon Toast Crunch flavor was a bust, but all decided we could've had 5 more (each) of the Captain Crunch flavor... but likely would've walked away with a stomach ache and been destined for an awful sugary hangover in a few hours.   The food was good but not spectacular. Our biggest complaint was that it was TOO much food. I ordered a breakfast burrito that was the size of my arm. By the time I was finished eating, I wasn't even able to make a dent. No one at our table came close to finishing our plates. Staying in a hotel with no fridge, it felt like a total waste.",

The frittata wasn't traditional in presentation but the chicken tinga on top was flavorful. The hash browns were lacking seasoning. My daughter didn't enjoy the chicken and waffles. The chicken was lacking seasoning and flavor. She said the waffle was just ok. This restaurant has a cute setup and decor but left a few things to be desired.

It was really good!  Our waiter was very attentive, always filling our coffee and water.  My husband had something with chorizo, I tasted the chorizo and it was very good.

The only fruit he offered was melon, of which we couldn't have. Moments later we saw several bowls of berries going by. We had to wait and wait just to get coffee, we finally asked another server for some. Aprielle then became our server - I believe she was also doing double duty as bartender to the Bloody Mary bar, yet still managed to take care of us. She was very pleasant and tried to fix what Evo messed up. When our food arrived it came with the potatoes that we were very clear about not wanting on our plates. I flagged down Evo and told him and also asked about all of the berries we saw going by, he told us that those were for children only! WHAT? Are you kidding me? Later we asked Aprielle about this, she said no and offered to bring us some. We declined as we were finished eating and a bit upset about the lack of knowledge and customer service provided by the manager. We may not return, especially if we see Evo on duty.",

    "text": "Turn your head the other way if you want a relaxing and quiet Saturday brunch. If you feel like extending your Friday night girls/boys night out, then this is your place.   We immediately got a table soon as we walked-in. The vibe was so alive. If you just got out of bed, walking-in to the restaurant would definitely wake you up to the tenth level. They have a DJ on a Saturday brunch. An actual club DJ!!! (I started to look for the dance floor when I walked-in).  The service was really nice. My glass of water was always full. Food was served fast and hot. Our server also gave good recommendations (a sign that he knows the menu). The restaurant was also very clean. Tables were set and cleaned as soon as the customer leaves the table.   The dishes that we had were just OK. I did not get a chance to try their famous Bloody Mary bar (which looked awesome by the way). I'm not a Bloody Mary fan but I guess it's something I'll consider trying the next time. Back to what we had, the food that we ordered had good points and some room for improvement. I had the Breakfast Lasagna and my wife ordered the Herb Fried Chicken and Waffles. The Herb Fried chicken was a little dry for my taste. A little over-cooked but had some good flavors. The herb wasn't very prominent but you know it's there. The waffles were nice. Soft and tasty on the inside and a bit crunchy on the outside. I would have wanted a little more bacon mixed in to the waffle but it wasn't a deal breaker. I still enjoyed it and the fried leeks on top complimented the dish very well. The breakfast lasagna was a bit of a let down for me. Maybe I would have loved it if it had a little more sausage and a little less potato. The potato and the lasagna pasta just had very little texture and flavor differences that it tasted very one dimensional. The bacon was crunchy but the dish needed more protein. The egg that was placed on top of the dish helped add flavor. The creaminess of the yolk gave some good points but I couldn't get past the potatoes. There was just too much. To be fair, the breakfast lasagna is new to their menu. That's what the server told us. Hopefully, improvements are on its way.  A great place with an OK food selection. I would definitely come back. Maybe I'll try the Bloody Mary bar the next time. Maybe I'll order one of the popular options. Maybe they deserve a 5, but for now just a 3.5 (4 at the most).

We asked our server to split our check (before he even brought it out to us) and he told us that it would be a problem... we went in for the $3 mimosa special, and when our server brought our check out he had our mimosas listed as $6, when I asked the server about it he told us that we had to ask for the deal?? Even though it was not advertised anywhere that we needed to ask for the deal..  Took 20 minutes to get our bill after we asked for it. The hottest went to serve us and started to ask the manager a question and he said \"no you do it\".   They need to work on their customer service. Wouldn't go back and pay $20 a meal for service like that.. bummer, really wanted this place to be great!",

Next time I'll try the Bloody Mary bar, I was in awe with the one my friend built but I was too full from my meal.  Note: there was a 40 minute wait, it may have been a little shorter.

Today I went in for a bloody Mary which was the most horrible tasting bloody Mary mix I ever had. I had the French toast which took forever & was extremely soggy.

The donuts were overcooked and were more like biscuits with the smallest amount of poorly made cannoli filling on top.  The corn beef hash Benedict was terrible. The corn beef was an out-of-the can (think Hormel) lump that was reminiscent of dog food. The hollandaise sauce and eggs were somehow devoid of taste. Finally, the potato pancake base was ok but could have been mistaken for a McDonalds 'hashborwn'.  Service was slow and barely came by the table (even though there was really anyone else around - definitely not peak time). Only positive thing was the server's attitude and helpfulness removing the cost of the donuts when we have honest feedback.",

I had the breakfast lasagna - which was very different and quite good. My daughter had the corned beef fried rice - which was good and again very different for a breakfast menu.  The inside didn't have much character or ambience but the service was good and food was tasty.",

Eventually we went in to see how much longer it would be (we were waiting 30+ minutes) and they had skipped over our name. We finally got sat. Waited a while for our food. Waited at least 30 minutes for our server Jesus to take our bill; it was kind of frustrating as there were just 2 in our party. It took over 2 1/2 hours to get in and out. Otherwise, good food but not worth the wait in my opinion.",

We had no problem this time with the french press and the coffee was excellent; fresh, smooth with no bitterness.  The food once again was very good. The service is tops, the staff really go out of their way to make sure you are happy and that meant a lot to us. The only downside is the noise level. It is a bit to much; between the morning hubbub and the DJ it makes for a bit too much noise. We started with the Cannoli Donuts; they are just delicious, warm, moist with that wonderful cannoli cream and chocolate chips. I had the Americano Scrambler which was delicious and creamy, my mother had the Hash Frittata which she really enjoyed it but it was a little bland for my taste. Both these entrees came with hash browns that are very good, seasoned perfectly and a biscuit which are light and flaky; I could have eaten more than one! My husband had the plain waffle and he commented on how the outside was crispy and nice and moist inside. Everything came out hot like you want with lots of soft butter. Our next visit will probably be when it cools down and we can sit outside on the patio where it is quieter.",

Great Bloody Mary bar and very innovative cocktails.  Service was fantastic and one of the owners, Bonnie clearly has a real love for what she is doing.  She greeted us when we came in, is pitching in with everything from moving tables around to bringing food out.  She made us feel so welcome and her love of what she's doing spills over to the staff who also seem to love their job. Highly recommend this place.  We will be back very soon!  P.S. Bonnie we loved your sparkly red dress.  You looked fabulous",

He recommended the Lump Crab and Sweet Potato Hash for my friend and the Coconut French Toast for me (I got it without bananas). Our food came out soo fast (maybe 10 minutes or even under) and was hot and fresh. The recommendations were on point. Chris was so nice and attentive. We're under age but the bloody mary bar looked really cool! It definitely picked up a little by the time we left and there was a wait but its so worth it.

    "text": "What a shame...The worst customer service I've had a long time. My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday for brunch, we are foodies who like to try a new spot every Sunday and since this place was highly rated we were excited to try it. We have worked in the industry a long time. First thing we noticed was that their was no one to greet us at the door, no big deal since we like to sit at the bar. We took a seat at the bar top which was not busy and it took 6 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. While we waited for someone to come over we noticed the bar top was dirty with glasses everywhere and empty plates. A bartender with short brown hair pushed menus in front of us without introducing herself. We ordered quickly and i decided to try the bloody mary bar, I was very impressed great selection of options the bartender at that bar was attentive and friendly. (looking back now I wished she had been our bartender) My boyfriend tried the mimosa flight but the bartender just said ok and disappeared without allowing him to pick the four he wanted. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and said, \"Well she probably just poured the four best ones for you.\" We got our food and it looked amazing and tasted so fresh. BUT....the bartender never came back for the first bites check up. I would hope that whoever reads this would know how important that is as we both would have loved to have some hot sauce, salt & pepper. The bloody Mary was spicy and I asked for a Sprite, I had to ask four times within our 35 minute visit. Another bartender was doing dishes behind the bar and I called over to her polietly for a sprite please, she didn't hear me so I waited politely . The woman next to us at the end of the bar laughed and said she was happy that the service aspect didn't just happen to her. We asked her how long she had been there and she said she had been there for a good while but that the bartenders never checked on her after she got her first drink and food. We looked to the left and another couple had empty drinks in front of them for a good while. My boyfriend wanted to try the bloody mary bar. I had to yell to the girl, \"Excuse me, sorry can we get one more ticket for the bloody mary bar, and a sprite please?\" She said yes and ran off to tell the other bartender. The other bartender says, \"Another bloody mary?\" I said, \"Yes, he wants to try the bloody mary bar, AND a sprite please.\" She brings back a bloody mary, and drops it off without a word. However we wanted another hash bloody Mary for the different vodka options we thought were interesting, I called to her again, at this point it was a little frustrating trying to get someone but no one hearing you, \"Excuse me he wanted to do the bloody mary bar, and I need a sprite please\" She said ok there was a miscommunication. We get to go back up and try different options on the bloody Mary bar set up. At this point we just wanted to leave after we tried the different bloody Mary. We finally received the bill however we saw that the miscommunication from the bloody Mary was not handled because the bloody Mary we didn't ask for was on the bill still. She finally dropped off the Sprite as we were explaining the bloody Mary issue. She fixed the issue and re-dropped the bill; There it sat untouched in front of us for a while. The couple next to us gets up to leave and mentioned the same frustration with service.  My boyfriend and I like to tip well because we work in the industry. My boyfriend as mad as he was still tipped 20%, and turned to me and said we are never coming here again. We walked out disappointed.",

She has such a charming personality and is such an asset to this place. She kept checking on us, to make sure that everything was perfect. We also, had an excellent server named Angelica. As jammed, as it was, she gave us great service. We each enjoyed, what we got, from pancakes, to eggs benedict, to frittatas. We all can't wait to go back there.",

For the price, there were plenty of options to dress up your beverage. Well done.  Staff was friendly and pleasant and we had good service.  The food was ok. The lump crab hash was mushy and bland. Great presentation in cast iron skillet but poached eggs over cooked. The lump crab eggs Benedict suffered from the same over cooked poached eggs and dry biscuit.",

Keep in mind, the was all prior to the actual reservation time and within about 7 minutes of being there. As soon as the other ladies showed up, they seemed a bit more relaxed about their income from the table but there was one woman who came by and snatched up two of the glasses in a huff because 2 people cancelled at the last minute.Nothing anyone at the table warranted that. The server was nice, the brunch was great and the dj was entertaining. Having been here once prior I knew what to expect. No one in our party tried the Bloody Mary bar, it seemed pretty popular.

I gave this place another try and ordered their donuts, chicken and waffles, Popsicle and lump crab Benedict.  The donuts were delicious and not too sweet! It had cannoli cream in the center with bite siZe chocolate chips and some orange zest mixed into it. The donuts weren't oily and were very soft with the outer part being a tad bit crispy! Each order comes with three donuts!   I ordered the chicken and waffles again and this time they made it correctly. The fried leeks on top of the chicken were lightly fried and had a sweet taste to it! It was amazing! Perfect combination with the chicken and waffles.   The lump crab Benedict had real crab on it and the homemade biscuits were absolutely delicious. The biscuits were soft and fluffy and the eggs were poached  just right.   Last but not least I ate their Popsicles for dessert. The Greek yogurt was light and didn't have that bitter taste to it. There were bananas, fruity pebbles and I believe strawberries in these Popsicle. Each order comes with two!   Everything was absolutely delicious! I was very satisfied with the service and also the food. I will definitely come back :) thanks again Joey.",

    "text": "First and foremost the service was great and I highly appreciate a good waiter or waitress. We came here with a party of 8 and they were very accommodating to that. We all were in awe of their lavish menu and everything on Yelp looked so good. I personally ended up going with the build your own Bloody Mary to start. Now I'm going to be very critical on this because I personally, make the best bloody Mary's (no joke you'll have to try). So the build your own Bloody Mary was being held to very high standards. I went with cucumber vodka (so good), their standard mix that is made in house and from their I did everything on my own. I got pickled okra, pickled celery which was spicy, I also got pickles, bacon, olives, lines and lemons. I added pickle juice and olive juice to it as well. Ahhhhh so good.  Now as for breakfast, my brother in law and I split a chorizo burrito (so good) and the chicken and waffles. I'm from SoCal and chorizo burritos are my jam. But this burrito was SOOO GOOD! I was really happy about that. The chicken and waffles blew my mind though. The chicken was seasoned really well and the waffle had bits of bacon in it. Yes I said it, bacon!!!! What impressed me the most was the waffle. It was fluffy and soft through out and most of the time you get a Belgian waffle like that it gets hard and crunchy on the outside. But not these!   Amazing time at Hash!!!!",

I called the morning of to make reservations for 20 for 5 hours later. My error, wholly and completely. I accept that. Luckily, I reached Linda. She was incredibly accomodating despite my lack of planning. She was transparent in setting expectations that another party had reservations 30 minutes after ours and they are still obligated to meet those prior reservations. I completely understood, but again, great business practice.   Once we arrived, Linda greeted me with hugs and birthday wishes. There was a mishap with my drink and before I could say anything, my server sweetly swooped it up and Linda promptly brought a fresh one, again with apology (and some birthday appetizers). Not needed - but definitely apreciated.  The food was phenomenal. Thankfully, our group was okay with sharing each other's plates bc there was not one thing ordered that wasn't excellent.   Thank you to Linda, our server (my apologies for not grabbing your name) and the staff who all made my 30th brunch memorable. You offered me the Southern Hospitality I'm used to and rarely find in AZ. We won't hesitate to come back (with better planning on our end).",

We recently came to Hash Kitchen for brunch and I'm glad we did. I enjoyed Christina's Tamale Cakes - eggs benny with sweet corn cakes, green chili pork, poached eggs, and green chili hollandaise. Ask for crispy onions on top! The flavors were perfect, but the tamale cakes were very crumbly. I didn't like the \"hash\" potatoes on the side - considering these are the restaurant's namesake, I expected them to be some amazing potatoes, but they were a little flavorless. I wanted to get a pancake instead of the potatoes but they wouldn't let me. Luckily, my boyfriend was generous enough to share some of his crispy + perfect french fries.   Next time I'd like to try the Bloody Mary bar, but it's pricey at $12/each.",

    "text": "I kinda feel like the Arizona Restaurant Association is spying on me.  They always seem to come up with promotions that are a virtual lock to lure me into one of their member's restaurants.  The bi-annual Arizona Restaurant Week is of course a fantastic way to try out some of AZ's more high end restaurants at a reasonable discount.  And now for the second year, they unveil their Arizona Breakfast Weekend.  Last year this promotion got me in the door of Original Breakfast House, a simple place with extraordinary food and way over-the-top friendly staff.  This year, I decided to use the discount promotion to try Hash Kitchen for the first time.  Saturday at opening, let's eat.  Hash's Scottsdale Rd & Doubletree Ranch location (southeast corner) was the closest of Hash's locations to my apartment so I came here.  Its on the far south side of the plaza (almost a block directly south of Pomo).  The restaurant is pretty sizable and can probably accommodate somewhere between 100-150 people at full capacity.  Maggiore Culinary Concepts (proprietors of several AZ & CA restaurant concepts including Tomaso's) is the brainchild of this restaurant.  When a True blood Italian like Joey Maggiore is running the show, it should come as no surprise that many of the signature menu items have an Italian tilt.  With items like cannoli pancakes, brunch bruschetta, and breakfast lasagna, its clear what kind of family runs the operation.  But the overall menu is pretty robust in other areas as well with items like croque madame, chilaquiles, brioche french toast, custom frittatas, and even chicken & waffles.  For AZ Breakfast Weekend, I stuck to the promotional offer for my first visit.  For $15 you get a house mimosa, a cannoli donut, and your choice of one of 5 main dishes.  Since this is the \"Hash\" kitchen after all, I decided on something with a Mexican flare.  The Carnitas Hash.  Pulled pork braised in Mexican Coke, hash potatoes, cotija cheese, roasted corn, avocado, green chili, cilantro, crema, and fried onions.  Also comes with a couple of warm corn tortillas on the side.  Including tax and tip the total cost for breakfast came to $20.  How'd the food measure up?  First the Mimosa.  A respectable, simple and classic drink.  Admittedly I'm more into some of the newer innovative takes on mimosas, but Hash's classic mimosa gets the job done.  Next, the cannoli donut.  Basically what you have here is a cinnamon flavored donut with cannoli filled in the middle and the donut hole on top and covered in powdered sugar.  I've never had something like this before and boy what a shame that is.  That cannoli filling was a ridiculously good accompaniment and I made sure I didn't leave any cinnamon or cannoli behind on this dish.  Definitely worth the indulgence.  Lastly, the hash.  And this thing was a monster!  There had to be close to a pound and a half of food in that skillet.  TONS of that pulled pork and a generous helping of eggs (I got mine scrambled).  Get a fork full of pork, avocado, eggs, and potatoes in one bite and I was on cloud nine.  A rich, hearty, hugely flavorful breakfast dish that eats like dinner.  For most people this dish would be sharable for two.  I made a couple of breakfast tacos out of it with the corn tortillas, but honestly the dish stands up proudly on its own.  I've heard the Bloody Mary Bar is a pretty big draw here, but I was honestly too full to give it a second thought (or a first for that matter).  Had I been here on a normal day, the total for the food and drink I ordered, plus tax and tip would've been closer to $35 (though Hash does offer 5% off your total with a Yelp Check In).  That said I probably wouldn't have docked any points even at that price.  The food quality was superb, the portions were more than generous and the staff (particularly at the bar where I sat) were excellent.  Just as with Original Breakfast House last year, I got a great deal thanks to the discount promotion.  So what did we learn today, kids?  Answer:  Don't EVER skip out on Arizona Breakfast Weekend.",

The food did look good though, but I wonder where the cooks placed their hands back where the crowd can't see.",

Big plates, they could be shared. The Salmon sandwich was amazing, carnitas hash was delicious!",

Quite loud, so don't expect a quaint quiet breakfast where you can hold a conversation. Was ok... don't think we'll be returning.",

They had a huge island bar right when you step in. To the right, a full bar and some high tables. To the left, regular dining tables. The decor was like a family restaurant with amazing comfortable seats plus a pinch of modern fun. This is just the first impression ! 1030 AM and these Arizonians are getting their drink on! They even had a freaking live DJ!    The staff was extremely attentive and friendly. There was an older lady walking around chatting with everyone. She was probably the owner.   The food was freaking delicious. I ordered a hash herb chicken and the wifey ordered carnitas hash. Delicious! They serve the food inside a mini cast iron pan. I couldn't finish it because the darn thing was stuffed of mini block potatoes.    They need one of these in the Bay!   Side note, don't come here if you're looking for a calm, quiet date night with the significant other. You'll be screaming at each other asking simple questions like \"how was your day?\"",

The service was really bad but they explained that people were filling in because it was an off day. We never went back but I had really wanted to give it another shot since everyone said how great the food was. We decided to go to the Gainey location today. The experience was really bad. We have kids so loud places are ideal but the music was so loud that I felt like I was in a club (no exaggeration). My husband asked if they could turn it down but they said that it was the atmosphere and that the music was below the legal limit. Time went on but we truly couldn't talk because it was so loud and others around us also didn't enjoy it so another man we were with went to see if there was anything that they could do. They said that corporate said, that is how it needs to stay and that was it. My ears are truly ringing. It was the most unpleasant breakfast and the food nor the price are worth what we just sat through. I would say that the only reason to go here is if you want a club experience while eating ok food and staff with a very blah personality. I am actually still in shock that this would be the \"atmosphere\" of any dining place. Some advice to people in the hearing loss industry...this is the perfect place to go to pass out your business cards!",

Lona will never steer you wrong- she took great care of our pup and of course us as well! Food was on point, but Lona was the best! We will be back to hang with her again.... We recommend asking for her by name, but she's only there M-F!",

It was perfection! The graham crackers and dusted on top on a marshmallow puff drizzled in Nutella and accompanied by butter and maple syrup. We had to get one hash fish, after all we came to Hash kitchen. We got the huevos hash! It was just the right balance of savory and sweet we needed with our two plates! I can't end my review without advising you to get a blood Mary at your BYOBM bar! They have a variety of options for your Bloody Mary with 40 toppings you can add to customize your own bloody! We are stuffed and happy and can't wait to visit again!",

The food, the flavors, the fun ambience, I wish they stayed open for dinner!   Apparently the secret is out though -- weekends, expect to wait. Expect to wait, and then have mediocre service. Our server took about 15 minutes to get to us, and then when we asked for the check, it took another 20 minutes and there were two items that we didn't order.   I've been there during the week though, and the service during less crowded times is on point and friendly and quick and accurate.  My only suggestion here would be to hire one or two more servers for the weekend hussle and bussle.  Otherwise, this place is absolutley amazing and I'm so glad its right around the corner from me.",

A DJ was blasting from a non esoteric dirty amplified mono speaker that would be suitable at a tawdry pool party at a non selective sorority at a C school.    The food was mediocre today and my frittata was dry,  eggs overcooked and taste underwhelming.  I suspect at least one of the cooks was either self medicating from the OSHA multiple worker safety violation ridden noise with earplugs or magic gummy bears.    The manager didn't think the pool party techno and bad 80s music blasting was inappropriate and a part  owner we complained to seemed very annoyed that we were giving honest feedback and started dancing awkwardly like she was reliving an ecstasy experiment from a couple decades ago.  She then came back to show some empathy, but I'm not sure how earnest her new interest was as we started to get glares from some of the wait staff.       This is definitely not a place to bring your parents (unless they are drunk or want to get drunk) or younger children.    Doubt we'll be going back.",

    "text": "If you love breakfast foods and culinary creativity, please go to Hash Kitchen, Bloody Mary's and Hashes, oh my! The Bloody Mary bar is truly a come see. It is a buffet of ingredients where the bartender will take your personalized order and all Bloody Mary fans' imaginations can run wild. First, start off with a choice between three house-made liquor mixes including: cilantro and lime or jalapeno and cucumber. We chose cilantro and lime, and were lucky to get a freshly made batch! There are DIY skewers with mason jars holding delicious ingredients around the bar and range from basics like mozzarella, corn, and mushrooms to more extravagant pieces like bacon, beef jerky, and oysters. You can also ask to get extra bacon on the rim and extra spice as well! Needless to say, the drinks were amazing and there is something for everyone! Next, we ordered our dishes. My fiance ordered the Carnitas Hash and I ordered the Lump Crab and Sweet Potato Hash with hollandaise sauce (recommended and requested) on the side. The dish came fresh off the stove in a piping hot skillet; the flavors paired exceptionally well together with the poached egg, hollandaise, sweet potato, and crab all culminated into a new twist on tried and True breakfast favorites. The Carnitas Hash was delicious too; it reminded me of a deconstructed breakfast burrito, and again, the creativity and use of local flavors were what made the dish amazing: fried onions, poached eggs, tender carnitas, avocados - all of the above made for mouth-watering bite after bite! At this point, we were practically stuffed, and we tried to leave without dessert but we just couldn't. We had to try the Cannoli Donuts, yes they are just what the sound like, donuts with cannoli filling in the middle. It was like eating a funnel cake topped with creamy cannoli stuffing- which is the best part of a cannoli! Our reaction? How has no one ever thought of this before?! And why is this not in donut shops everywhere?! Besides the food, the customer service was spectacular. We were treated as if we were friends visiting another friend's home for a good meal. We were delighted to converse with Chris, one of the managers, who made great recommendations, and also made our first experience at Hash Kitchen fun and memorable. We cannot wait to take our friends and family here to show them one of the best breakfast spots in the Valley!  A few tips: -Come during non-busy hours, apparently weekends are packed for good reason, there's a live DJ and the Bloody Mary bar boasts over 40 ingredients to select from. Get the Cilantro and Lime house mix for your base. -Come here hungry, the portions are big and the ingredients are hearty, so this is a spot for those ready to indulge! Order the Carnitas Hash, the Lump Crab and Sweet Potato Hash, or Herb Chicken for the best flavors. -Breakfast and lunch served all day. -The restaurant is open to hosting your own private event, with no extra fee for the event space, which is a plus!",

    "text": "I always said I have a half-assed memory, maybe I need to correct that to a \"half-HASHED\" memory:    I came to visit Hash Kitchen by way of a faulty memory.  I was visiting Scottsdale to see a concert and also visit with an old friend, who bought breakfast for the two of us.  A Yelp Friend of mine (in SoCal) had highly recommended a place I mistakenly remembered as \"Hash Kitchen\"; I later discovered my YF's recommendation was for a place in San Diego and Las Vegas called \"Hash House a Go-Go\".  Oh well, I still need to \"Go-Go\" to that one, but the mistake turned out to be a good one!  Hash Kitchen is fantastic!  We ate there on a Sunday morning; they apparently have a brunch and had a P.A. set up, blastin' out some good tunes (don't know whether or not there was a DJ).  The place was lively.  SURPRISE!  (not really); the place has Hash on the menu!  Since that's in their name, it would stand to reason that it BETTER be good, right?  I had the Corned Beef Hash, and it certainly was.  Cubed Corned Beef with diced Hash Browns, with an over-easy egg perched atop the whole shebang, served in a cast iron skillet.  And with a biscuit I probably could've eaten a half-dozen of, at least.  Service was good, nice casual environment.  They have a lot more than Hash on the menu, I'm sure everything else is just as good.  Hash Kitchen is definitely on my short list of places to eat, next time I'm in the Scottsdale / Phoenix area.  I was told they plan on opening up a coupla more locations in the near future.  Please check 'em out!  Sidebar: I just noticed, I've had almost 175,000 views of my pics, over the last 90 days!  (174,949 to be exact)  I didn't even know Yelp tracked that sort of thing, and certainly never dreamed my pics could be that popular.  So, THANK YOU to all my loyal viewers!  I am humbled.  Sorry, no pictures this time, but now that I know they're getting that many views.  I'll take some next time.   \"larrythediner\"",

We waited for about 15 minutes to sit in the patio (which is fine). Phoenix isn't TOO bad at 9:30 in the morning for a girl that's 7.5 months VISIBLY pregnant. So, once our buzzer goes off, we get sat and wait... and wait... and wait. Only to never be helped. So, I went inside and asked for someone to bring us water (because this is Phoenix.. in the summer...). The hostess brought our water, filling our glasses up half full with room temperature water (hey, thanks!) When our server comes out, no explanation is given. Only a \"sorry guys\". Once we put our order in, we waited another 15 minutes for ONE mimosa. I don't even want to start on the time frame of our food because you can ALL probably guess the wait time on that... Trust me, had I known this place was trendy and like a night club, I would've passed specifically because of that, but I didn't, and maybe that's my fault. Oh, and was anything taken off our bill? Nope. Did a manager ever come out? Nope. Did our server offer to refill our drinks? No. Did we sweat our asses off waiting for our bill? Sure did. But, either way, this has probably been the WORST dining experience I have truly ever had. Worst customer service EVER. I will never return to this location (possibly business) ever again. This place is NOT WORTH IT. We were here almost 2.5 hours for pancakes... PANCAKES.",

I will say the pancakes were good, as well as the service. Glad we tried it, but will not go back.",

When you first walk in you are greeted by the bloody Mary bar, and it looks amazing ! I will be back to try it. The decor is nice and the chairs comfortable. But the icing on the cake was the great service by our server rachael.   Usually the servers cringe at my mother's particular requests because of her diet restrictions but she wasn't phased one bit and love that she continually checked in on us. My biggest pet peeve is a server who asks for your drink order never to reappear....so I was very pleased with her promptness. I think service says a lot about the bones of a restaurant. Now on to the food.  Absolutely delicious. Pancakes, the frittatas, and everything else we had was cooked to perfection. Also when the food arrived it was still piping hot which I love.  My only complaint would have to be the wait time and thay it can be quite noisy because of how busy they are.",

Then my wife remembered she had read about The Hash Kitchen.  We went to check it out.  The menu is out on the patio to review before choosing to go in and eat.  It certainly looked good.  When we got in and seated, we were greeted by nothing but warm and friendly people.  It was busy but not obnoxious busy.  However we didn't have to wait long to order, although with as many really good looking choices on the menu, we took some time to decide but we were checked up on every couple of minutes.    I ended up having the Herb Chicken and Waffle.  Wow!  I've had something similar at a place some of you may know, Hash House A-Go-Go.  This beats that place in my opinion.  It was very tasty.    My wife had the Short Rib Benedict.  I had a bite.  Another wow.  I also had a side of their bacon.  Some of the best bacon I've ever had!!  Between the service and the food, we will definitely be back.  I'm impressed.  Now I'm glad we got shut out of the other places.  I always say things happen for a reason.  I was meant to try this place and so are you.  You won't be sorry!",

When we told him we actually just wanted the traditional he looked at me and said \"ok\" very rudely and grabbed the ticket up off the table and walked off. The wait just to get our drinks was forever! I asked for a water as well and waited forever for that as well. When the food was brought out we asked for an extra set of silverware because we were short one. That took forever as well as my food sit in front of me getting cold. Needless to say our waiter did not return for refills or just to make sure we were doing ok. The next time we saw him was to bring our ticket so he made it an easy choice at that point to change locations to continue our brunch time.",

    "text": "I do like the Hash Kitchen.  Their Bloody Mary bar is the best I have been to. Their food options are great, but it doesn't even compare to the amount they give you and the quality.  Their food is just amazing.  Other than the food, the wait staff is good and efficient.  The reason I am giving a 4 out of 5 is because on the weekends they have a DJ that comes in and blasts music.  The music is extremely loud, and feels like a club.  It ruins the atmosphere of a brunch.  I personally think they should get rid of it.  The best time to go is during the week.  I had my family visit, and I knew I did not want them to come during the weekend, how embarrassing would it have been to take my entire family to a club to each brunch.  I hope they read this review and remove the DJ, I think their weekends will do even better than they already are if they do so.",

Even though i don't drink bloody Mary's, i was impressed by the extensive selection of accompaniments. I ordered the corned beef hash. I've had much better. The corned beef looked like it was dumped out from a can. I had to pour hot sauce on top to give it some flavor. My friends had the chillaquilas and Mexicana scramble. They enjoyed their meals. Coffee was good, they have almond and soy milk as creamer alternatives. Mimosa flights available too.",

You can tell they put thought and care into decorating this place, love the cute chairs and wall paintings!  BYOM - Build Your Own Mary Bar was the best I've ever seen!! A huge variety of pickled items (eggs, zucchini, carrots, green beans, cauliflower, different kinds of olives), multiple vodkas to choose from (including cilantro Lime & bacon infused!), also they had meatballs and fried raviolis available as garnishes since it was the weekend!   Food - Amazing! So hard to choose what have, but we decided on the Coconut & Almond Encrusted French Toast and the Carnitas Hash. Both were awesome with huge portions!  Service - this was the icing on the cake. I've never been more well taken care of at a restaurant! Multiple individuals came to check on us, including who I assume to be the owner.   All in all, amazing spot and wish they had one in Southern California!!",

The energy of this place is amazing...  The food was also top notch.  I recommend the S'mores French Toast which is graham cracker brioche / nutella / charred marshmallow fluff.  This was a massive dish.  You get the crunch of the cracker with the char of the marshmallow fluff with the nutella taste on the back end.  Super rich super awesome!  The next thing you must get since the place is called Hash Kitchen you have to get the Herb Fried Chicken which is potato hash / poached eggs / fried leeks / warm maple reduction.  The fried Chicken had a nice crisp crunch and a juicy white meat center, then you get the taste of the egg yolk, and then you get the sweet of the warm maple syrup.  Boom Sweet and Salty in one dish!  The only knock would be the service was ok.  The waiter did not come around enough to fill up our cups and check in on us for what we needed.  Overall, if you are about to go out to a pool party or go party at some happy hour later go to Hash Kitchen to get you amped up!    BrandonFitFoodie",

    "text": "Recently, my father and I were looking for a different place to eat brunch on a Saturday morning.  While we expect there to be a long wait for a good brunch on Sundays, it was a surprise to us to find a 45 minute or so wait on a Saturday.  While this was certainly longer than we would have wanted, the Hash Kitchen staff made sure we were comfortable with small cups of juice and tastes of one of several DELICIOUS starters.  I tried a piece of brunch bruschetta with fig jam, warm brie, and thick bacon.  I so look forward to actually ordering this in the future.    Both my father and I felt like a Scrambler, where we both ordered Thick Cut Bacon Scramblers (potatoes, onion, swiss cheese) served with hash potatoes and a warm buttermilk biscuit (or toast).  Clearly, I am my father's son!  The food was tasty and well worth the wait though the service itself could have been better.  Our server was helpful though she clearly had too many tables to watch over.    Hash Kitchen has some great specials from weekday $3 craft mimosas, weekday $5 bloody mary bar, and Kids Eat Free Mom Mondays.  Also, if you check in on Yelp, you get 5% off your bill even on the weekend!  While I would prefer not to wait so long for a table, I definitely have every intention to have brunch at the Hash Kitchen in the future.",

I did not see it on the menu but our wonderful waitress informed us that we could do a bottomless mimosa bar for $9 and 1 penny each mimosa after. We tried mango, grapefruit, strawberry, kiwi, orange, and black cherry were all delicious.  We started brunch with the hash monkey and my boyfriend informed me it was the best he had ever had. For our main courses we had the carnitas hash and chicken tienga frittata. The food was SO SO GOOD! The portions came out and they were so big and we said no way are we eating all this and of course we did.  The ambience was nice and quiet at about 1:00 pm when we arrived. Overall we loved it! I'd come back again and again! Wish I lived closer!",

We've sat at the bar for a quick breakfast, hosted our daughter's birthday brunch and everything in between. We've never had a bad experience.    Hash has a 'gem' and her name is Bonnie. I don't know what Bonnie's official title is but she is someone to look forward seeing each weekend. Her personality is contagious and so are her dance moves. She goes above and beyond ensuring her guests are taken care of and enjoying themselves.  Bonnie makes our visits extra special.   Why go somewhere else when you can go to Hash and have an experience!! Thanks Hash for your venue, food and staff! Especially Bonnie!",

We went for Sunday brunch, and things seemed a little crazy and unorganized in there. We were underquoted for our wait time and ended up waiting 30 minutes longer than we were told. Our server was never present, we were given food without silverware, and then I had to physically get up to grab a manager to get silverware, syrup, water, and coffee refills. I am a server so I get it when you're busy, but our server never came back to quality check our food, and we felt as if we were a burden to be asking for anything. The food was awesome, and always is, but the service and management were very underwhelming. We were then approached by the manager to rate them on yelp, so here I am.

The menu is eclectic...from the hash dishes to the Benedicts, all outstanding. The servers personable, the Bloody Mary bar is a showstopper, and the hostess, Bonnie, is so friendly you want her to join your table... thanks for a great experience!",

It's in a nice plaza with lots of parking. It has an upscale feel, but with great prices. The food is DELICIOUS! Not to mention, their bottomless mimosas which are a win! I have recommended this place to so many of my friends and they always love it as well. I found my new favorite brunch spot! :)",

    "text": "Based off of the reviews and menu online, we were super excited to try this place. Arrived at 11:30 on a Saturday and had to wait 25 minutes for a table--no biggie. They had a DJ who was BLASTING music, so we sat outside. I find it hard to believe that people want to feel like they're at the club when they're eating brunch, but perhaps I'm not hip enough.   We ordered scramblers, chocolate chip pancakes, and steel cut oats. The scramblers were fine, but I thought the portion was a little small for the cost. They came with potatoes on the side that were undercooked to the point where they could not be saved by ketchup. There was also a buttermilk biscuit that was the best biscuit I've ever had, and the main reason why I gave them two stars instead of one. The oats were fine--would have been better with brown sugar, but our waitress never brought it after multiple asks. The chocolate chip pancakes were horrible. After being brought plain buttermilk pancakes, we received our correct order only to find that they were undercooked. They took them off of the bill, but at that point we just decided to cut our losses and get my daughter breakfast somewhere else.   Also, they advertise their juices as \"fresh\" but it definitely was from concentrate. I have no problem with that, but if I'm paying $5.25 for a glass of orange juice and it's described as \"fresh\" I would expect something slightly better...   Overall, mediocre food and spotty service. Really wanted to like this place, but I don't think we'll be returning.",

My friend joked he wanted an Oreo and a minute later the bartender came out with a plate of two Oreos. Gross on the Bloody Mary of course but I got a rumchata iced coffee and it was good with that.

Our waiter, Evan, was fantastic and kept us laughing the whole time. Service was amazing and we definitely enjoyed the brunch & mimosas! I had to include a special review on Bonnie. SHE BRINGS HASH KITCHEN TO LIFE!!! Bonnie was wonderful with EVERYONE that entered the restaurant. She was outside moving tables around to accommodate guests, she helped with clearing and was constantly in motion. I noticed that she always had time to leave a kind word, she took a moment to dance to the music and genuinely seemed to enjoy \"work\" in the same way we were enjoying \"play.\" Thank you to Bonnie, Evan & the entire Hash Kitchen staff. We'll absolutely be back soon!",

It is kind of sad if the biscuit is the best part of your breakfast ... Like I said, just an overall mediocre experience, overpriced, and mediocre service.

Not \"The Hash Kitchen\".  Yes it's new, yes it's pretty and comfy and aesthetically pleasing, so pleasing I had a bloody mary at noon, but it's more.  The food is fresh and delicious but the people made the difference.  I would be pleased to meet a client there or have brunch.  Today,I was met by a lovely lady outside the front door welcoming me and letting me know my girlfriend was already there.  Then I met our server Chris.  Chris and his quick wit made it OK for us to drink in the middle of the day.  I appreciated that.  He led the way to the Bloody Mary Bar (BMB) and mixed up the basics for us 1st using one of their own infused vodkas.  Tina, aka Gina, and I had a vodka infused with cilantro and I added some habanero for a spicy kick.  He then waved his left hand out, palm up and to the side as if to say \"ta da\", inviting us to add over 20 side items to our drink.  2 thick pieces of bacon to start, oysters chilling on ice, horseradish which I stupidly added after the habanero, 3 kinds of olives, at least 3 kind of pickles, I think I saw a whole egg, maybe asparagus?, I'm not sure, I saw salami and Slim Jim's and was done.  SLIM JIM.  I'm not going to lie, I was real classy, I put 1 in my purse and gave it to my husband when I got home.  We also met fellow server Anthony and the proud owner Joey who between those 2 and Chris, I'd just go back for the comedy team.  I know what's going to happen.  People are going to catch on about how great this place is and I'll never get a breakfast seat again, maybe I'll get an honorary booth in the back.  I'm going back for chicken and waffles, bacon in the waffle yes please!, and Nutella and banana French toast.  Your fan, Keri aka Terry.",

Wait wasn't bad, and we were welcomed with a friendly face. Once we were seated with a young toddler, we had to seek out our server after more than 10 minutes. Good thing I packed some snacks! We never had our server refill coffee, apologize that it took almost 30 minutes to get a side of fruit for the little one or do much else. She did serve one person in our party, and the dish was incorrect. She didn't really seem to be interested in us at all. It became quite unpleasant to have people waiting to be seated within 2 feet of me. It was so stressful to worry about how long we could stick it out with a young child. There are other places to have breakfast that sincerely care and have excellent food in the area.",

They have every topping you could imagine... something like 40 different options. And don't even get me started on their food! TO DIE FOR. I am a harsh critic of eggs bennies, and the three out of five I've tried so far were absolutely delicious. They really have everything you could possibly want for brunch. I could eat here every single day. Their hashes are sooooo good, they have fried chicken and waffles, french toast, red velvet pancakes... It's like I died and went to heaven. Needless to say, I am a huge fan of this spot. The overall vibe and atmosphere is just great and somewhere I'll probably take my friends weekly. I definitely recommend you check it out!",

My biggest issue was deciding what to order since everything sounded amazing. I opted for the carnitas hash (carnitas being another of my loves), it was juicy, tender, and flavorful. Boyfriend ordered the huevos rancheros hash and loved it as well, and he is normally not a hash lover either! Although I did not partake, the Bloody Mary bar looked very interesting with a ton of options to personalize your drink (Bacon infused vodka? Sorry I missed it!)  But even with the great food, the service was even better. Bonnie, the lady who seated us, was a delight in particular, checking in with us often and chatting with us about what brought us to town and where we were from. She really went out of her way to be attentive and welcoming, and is the reason I'm taking the time to write this review. Thanks Bonnie!!",

I had a lovely bloody Mary from the do it yourself bloody Mary bar. What an impressive assortment! I ordered the red velvet pancakes, which were decadent and divine. My hubby had the brisket hash, which he loved. I tasted his hash and it was so flavorful and delicious. We both had a French press of Italian coffee, how thoughtful to have individual, fresh  French press style coffee! Delicious.   We were very impressed and love the atmosphere. The DJ on a Sunday morning was a cute touch and elevated the vibe of the whole place. He wasn't too loud at all, just right to have pleasant conversation. The owners were buzzing from table to table making sure everyone was enjoying their experience. What a nice couple.  I believe we just found our new regular weekend spot for early dining!",

    "text": "This was my 2nd time coming to Hash Kitchen, And once again I was not disappointed.   My only complaint is their wait system. They still do it old school and give out buzzers after signing up with the host. When the wait is over an hour long, you wish that you could go somewhere else in the meantime. Really hoping that they start to use NoWait so you can either get in line before hand or at least have the option to view your place in line and get a text when your table is ready.  Mimosa flight, amazing. Mine came with OG mimosa, peach, raspberry, and strawberry. I loved the peach and raspberry mimosas. Make sure to get a straw and mix them up to get the full flavor of the juice/muddled fruit! So delicious.  Breakfast/brunch are my favorite meals and I always have the hardest decision choosing between sweet or savory.   Luckily, my friends and I ordered the breakfast bruschetta to share. We loved both the banana and Nutella bruschetta and the strawberry and Brie.   For my entree, I ordered the hash chicken Benedict. The fried leeks are amazing and go so well with the fried chicken. Sometimes I have to stop myself from eating just the crispy leeks first because they're just that good. I have no idea what they bread their chicken with, but it's the perfect mix of savory and just blends so well with the leeks and biscuits.  Overall, I would definitely come back. The food and mimosa/bloody bar are 100% worth the wait.",

It's they only thing they cared about was being load and bar! Why serve food if you don't care to take care of people with basic needs!",

Hearing protection is recommended, especially for employees for 8 hr exposure periods. Nine of us recently ate at the HK location on 877 Scottsdale Blvd and average db level measured by dbMeter was greater than 90 db average on 3/16/2019 at 10:00AM with  Low 87db to high 107db. We politely voiced our concern and your location manager told us that he liked it loud and had been operating with this db level for the past 4 years without complaint. We informed several of your location employees that employees working with noise levels greater than  85 db for 8 hrs should be provided with hearing protection. Your manager dismissed and ignored our comments and walked away. We were informed by our waitress that a DJ set the sound level and it could not be adjusted. I asked who had responsibility for adjusting the sound volume db when DJs were not present but no one answered me.   We liked your bar drinks, food menu selections, and service but respectfully request that you consider decreasing db sound to  Average hearing/conversation levels (85db or less) so customers and staff don't have to shout across tables to be able to hear/understand conversations and waitress menu selections.

Ate outside, a really good thing because the DJ had the music blasting inside.  Impossible to hold a conversation, impossible to relax.  Obviously trying to be the hip place, but really does it need to be this loud? Larry ordered the carnitas hash.  Wow, huge bowl of all good things he said.  Pork hash, potatoes, 2 eggs, avocado, fried leek straws, corn, and cheese. I had a Belgian waffle with fresh fruit.  Light and tasty waffle, would have enjoyed a little more fruit, but a very satisfactory choice. Two ice coffees with 2 refills, coffee could have been a little stronger, but a good choice on a hot day. Our server was attentive and helpful with recommendations.   Plenty of parking, a plus. Definitely will be back, and will sit outside....",

It was almost impossible to get the bartenders attention for a drink, she was slammed. Once seated our waitress was pushy & wanted a fast order. She acted like she had no time to waste. She rarely displayed a smile & acted very stressed. This is the first time going to this location. I normally frequent their North location, it's just a mile from my house. The food was still great. I'd personally recommend if you want a laid back, NOT crazy busy loud brunch, head to North location. Probably won't be back to this location.",

I asked for the English muffin in my eggs Benedict to be over toasted and it wasn't toasted at all. It took forEVER to get our breakfasts and when they arrived the eggs were cold. I asked for more hot water for my tea TWICE and they never came back. We sat there for over thirty minutes before someone thought to come and refill our waters. In short, the meals were cold, not to order, and we felt fairly neglected. Normally I'd speak up while still at the restaurant but I was dining with s friend who'd never been there AND she was picking up the tab so I didn't want to embarrass her or make the experience awkward. Had this been my first time in I'd never return. Because I know they can do better I'll probably give them another chance but wow... truly awful today.",

    "text": "Disappointed in the service. The restaurant refers to themselves as a creative breakfast experience, so with this in mind while ordering, I told my waiter I was vegan and asked for his recommendation. He responded \"oh you're SOL, you'll have to sit and watch everyone eat. Our kitchen is all animal products.\" Thinking he was maybe joking and knowing I saw a fruit platter, oatmeal, and many veggies on the menu, I responded \"so there's nothing I can eat?\" He then replied that he can do grilled veggies. Very, very disappointed in the lack of thoughtfulness by our waiter. I ended up ordering potatoes with pico de gallo, avocado, and a side of fruit. The potatoes were fine, nothing better than your average breakfast spot. The side of fruit was weak-grapes, pineapple, and cantaloupe.   My food was fine, it filled me up but was nothing I would return for. The other guests in my party (non vegan) were very pleased with their meals, but agreed that our waiter was very rude and off-putting about my vegan request.  A few other negatives: there was a bug crawling around in our centerpiece, it was no big deal I just didn't want it on my table. I took the small centerpiece outside just to release the bug and two different individuals walked up to me in a panic as if I was stealing their cheesy centerpiece. I explained the bug situation and they allowed me to get rid of the bug, with no apology for a bug inside their restaurant... Then, there was an older lady (apparently the hostess) walking around shaking maracas. She appeared to be having a great time which was fun, and I'm sure the later day/drinking crowd might enjoy that, but mostly it was just odd for a breakfast... did not add to my experience. Others around didn't seem to be enjoying it either, and she was dancing all over them.   Positives: DJ",

First time here and this place looks beautiful but i guess you cant judge a book by its cover because this book is horrible. I am sad to see such a beautiful restaurant being managed so poorly.

    "text": "Pretty disappointing. So I've been to the Hash Kitchen on Frank Lloyd Wright about 3 times and while there is usually about a 30 min wait on the weekend, the food always makes up for it. However this experience at the Scottsdale Road location ruined my love for Hash Kitchen. What got me hooked originally was the chicken and waffle. It has consistently delighted me and was the reason why I chose Hash Kitchen above any other place to brunch this past Sunday. It was my boyfriends first time and although he was starving I convinced him the 45 min wait was so worth it. I wanted him to try it because Im always raving about the food particularly the chicken and waffle. However the food was a True let down to the point that I'm not really sure I want to waste money again at any Hash Kitchen. The chicken and waffle was a joke and I felt almost insulted after much anticipation. I started to cut up my food then I realized it was hardly chicken and a waffle. It was basically a waffle with one tiny chicken strip topped with a ridiculous mountain of fried leeks. I'm not sure if the kitchen had just run out of chicken or if this is now how this dish comes. It has always come topped with fried leeks but at least there was substance under those leeks. At least you felt like you were getting a normal amount of chicken for $14. This was just insulting and I wish I had taken a picture. I honestly wonder if they were just low on chicken and thought they could get by with selling one last order by putting a pathetic shrunken sized chicken strip on there and covering it up with a ridiculous mountain of the fried leeks and hoping that maybe I wouldn't notice. I really hope this is the case because if cutting down the amount of chicken and increasing the amount of fried leeks is now how the dish comes then they need to seriously reevaluate things. The second item we ordered was equally disappointing. I love fruity pebbles and I love pancakes but the fruity pebble pancakes were awful. I don't mind spending $12 on pancakes if they are worth it. These pancakes were a bit overdone on the bottom and just tasted like regular old pancakes but with a hint of sour milk. Nothing fruity pebble about it except maybe the color of the batter. Also having a DJ at brunch is fun and can add to the experience but the acoustics at this location are terrible. At least at the FLW location you can hear each other talk and don't have to scream across the table. This whole experience was disappointing and I probably should have said something while we were there but I just wanted to get out of there ASAP. I was so looking forward to showing my foodie boyfriend a great brunch spot but it was a total fail and waste of money and I'm sad my favorite dish is no longer. The end.",

The wait wasn't too bad about 20 minutes, but more and more people kept checking in to wait for a table.  All of the items on their menu looked good and made me want to try everything.  I had a really hard time deciding on what to choose, but I went with their specialty dish Breakfast Lasagna. The dish sounded delicious and interesting, so i had to give it a try. My husband tried the Carnitas Hash.    The Breakfast Lasagna was creamy and satisfying, it definitely hit the spot. It was filled with breakfast favorites eggs, sausage, bacon as well as traditional lasagna ingredients such as ricotta and mozzarella. The Carnitas Hash was also delightful, the carnitas were very tender and flavorful. The dish arrived on a skillet still bubbling on the side with gooey cheese. We'd love to try other dishes here and will definitely go back the next time we're in phoenix!  Parking can be an issue, when we visited there was construction in a nearby store so part of the parking lot was blocked off and limited the number of parking spaces.",

We went on a Saturday morning around 11, and we were seated promptly. There was a DJ playing, and the music selection was great! We immediately ordered the bloody mary (I'm usually not a huge fan of bloody Mary's, however the make your own bloody mary bar seemed too good to pass up). I got the cilantro vodka and medium spicy (definitely spicy enough - would not be able to have any more spice to it). The bar had such a great selection - bacon, salami, pickled celery, asparagus, mango, eggs, and oysters. The pickled eggs were surprisingly delicious - it was the first time I had tried it.   For food, everything we ordered was great. There were a bit too many potatoes in the huevos ranchero hash, but that's a personal issue. I'm not the biggest fan of potatoes. It was flavorful and there was plentiful.   The service was excellent! Our waiter was extremely friendly, great with food recommendations and enjoyable small talk! I really enjoyed my experience here! Will definitely be back :)",

No problem, we expected that. So after sitting out front and enjoying the beautiful Arizona spring weather we were excited to hear our name called. Up we went and through the dining room we walked and further around a corner and to a back room which is apparently their secondary restaurant. I'm not complaining, however I really wasn't expecting to be seated in a secondary BBQ restaurant like an uninvited cousin. If this was the seating they were offering we most definitely should have been told when we put our name on the list.Things didn't really get much better from there. The food was average and overpriced. The service, while friendly, was scant and overworked. We couldn't hear the music in the nice part of the restaurant because we were seated in what amounts to the back room. We didn't even know about the bloody mary bar until we left. I can't even stress enough our disappointment in this visit. And sadly we won't be going back even though we live around the corner.",

We got our order to go again, but we will definitely have to try to eat in next time. Lona took my order and was very fast and efficient. She made sure my order was correct and got us drinks while we waited. The manager was very nice as well and very engaging with all the customers. I'd say the environment is very hip and fun. There is loud music playing, and it is very loud inside so if that's not your thing, I wouldn't recommend it. Today I ordered the Carne asada with eggs and waffles. The Carne asada was AMAZING. It was very tender and had just the right amount of seasoning. I let my husband have a bit and he was very envious. The hash potatoes were good as well, I like that it's really just diced potatoes because I've never cared for hashbrowns. Waffle was good as well. My son got the apple pie pancakes and Italian sausage. I took a taste of his pancakes and they were delicious! It really did remind me of apple pie, it also came with this apple cinnamon cream that topped it off. Italian sausage was good too. My husband go the americano eggs and said it was good but he definitely loved my food more. We can't wait to come back for more! Oh and they said that they did change the paper lining in their to go boxes. They gave us plastic containers for our to go meals this time so there was no lining.",

Service has been great, never an empty coffee cup and rarely a hiccup in the kitchen with missed orders or bad execution.  The only disappointments have been the chicken/waffles due the use of rather bland chicken breast and times when the dice potato in the hashes are under and way al dente for a breakfast.  We have also asked about the morning DJ sound level and were told that he has final say on the knob setting. The work around is to dine earlier in the morning.  Really like the fact that the menu changes slightly nearly every month, with a new dish or two appearing, while some other items get dropped off.  Put something other than chicken breasts on those dishes and I'll give it another try.",

I went in on a Sunday late morning with a friend and we sat at the bar. Neither of us had a cocktail but I could see that the booze was flowing and the bloody Mary bar looked great. I ordered a bacon scramble and my friend ordered some sort of eggs Benedict. My scrambled eggs were over cooked to the point that they were brown and dried out . The cubed fried potatoes were greasy but the buttermilk biscuit was perfect, flaky and moist. Even though my plate was still three quarters full when the bartender took it away she still never asked me how my food was.  All she asked me was if I was finished? Going forward I think I'll stick to Butterfields,I may have to wait 20 minutes to get a table but it's always worth it!",

However, this restaurant has a \"build your own\" Bloody Mary bar (which doubles as pre-breakfast food) and has a very nice owner? (she has some upper position at The Hash Kitchen) named Bonnie. She was communicative about our wait time and upcoming table, hilarious, and fun! The whole experience was worth the wait. I haven't even talked about the food. We got a regular hash and French toast. It. Was. AMAZING. It is 3 pm and I am still full. They play with flavors in a great way (I.e. Churro pancakes) and you leave wishing you could have this restaurant every morning. They have \"flights\" of Mimosas... strawberry, blueberry, gruava, and orange... amazing. In conclusion: go here and make sure to call ahead and get a reservation (if you can), if you can't... still go! You won't be sad!",

    "text": "I've been here twice with my fiance and both times were quite good. We've split several of the hashes and the Benedict's. I have to say that the smoked brisket was the winner out of all the dishes I've tried. The cornbread was just sweet enough to counter the smoke and salt of the brisket and also to balance out the green chili. Another favorite was the fried chicken hash although was a little over cooked and overall ate a little dry. The eggs Benedict was just ok and not overly impressed with the hollandaise. Lastly we had the crab skillet with old bay aioli which again was just ok. Crab was good but could have been fresher. The sauce sold the dish, delicious. Lastly, the Bloody Mary bar... Big fan. Any excuse to stick as much goodness into a morning cockatail as I can fit!  The flavored vodkas were delicious, especially the cilantro lime and they don't skimp on it;). Also tried a bloody without the bells and whistles of the buffet style build it your way and it was still equally delicious and less work. I highly recommend Hash kitchen if only for a morning cocktail and some good hangover chow.",

He suggested the French press coffee, and showed up at just the right time to \"press and pour\". He recommended a fruit plate while we looked over the menu, which was perfect for a leisurely style brunch experience.  Leo seemed very knowledgeable about the menu and encouraged us to ask ANY questions; we chose the smoked salmon eggs benedict and the Brisket and Eggs, based on his recommendations, BOTH were filling and flavorful, and just as he described . Too full for dessert, but he said he made a \"killer mocha\" which we shared, our only mistake not getting two; we will be back, great brunch experience !",

It was VERY spicy so we asked them to dilute it with a little more tomato juice but otherwise good. The best part of this experience was the customer service. At first we thought the wait was going to be long. The lady in the front was telling the group ahead of us 30mins to an hr and we were going to leave. But she cleared a high top for us so we could be seated immediately. The server and manager was equally nice, stopping over to make small talk and joke with us. I love how every person there is working; management and all. That's how a restaurant is suppose to operate.  Not just management pointing fingers for other people to do work. They were busy and they all help clear tables and bus. Keep up the great work guys! =)",

Your meal is actually individually made to order which is hard to find these days. Being from the east coast where we have diners everywhere, it has been hard to find a place to get a delicious breakfast here. Its also nice to have a classier place to go for breakfast, not many options for something like that.

My complaint isn't really with the service, but when we were done eating, the \"get these people outta here and open up the table\" crew was in force. Constant peeks around the corner and asking if there's something else we want, etc. Even picked up the paid bill a second time and asked 'mistakenly' if we wanted to pay our bill. It was like the outlaw getting kicked out of a bar in the old west.  Doors swing open....we land on our butts.  I get turning our table is money...but wow.  Don't get me wrong...nobody was outwardly rude.  Just very passive aggressive.    I'll give them another shot and change my review if justified.",

He started with a Berry Memosa and I had a Mocha Coffee with a side shot of Kaluhua to add as I drank it. It is incredibly delicious, (not to mention the waitress gave me a generous amount of Kaluhua in the shot).   My husband had the smoked brisket, eggs over medium, hash potatoes and a side of pancakes. It was exactly what he was hoping it would be and so much more. The smoked brisket was bursting with flavor and came with a side of warm barbeque sauce that was sweet and tasty.  We shared the pancakes which were delicious as well. The reduced maple syrup is amazing!  I had the Lump Crab Eggs Benedict. It is two perfectly poached eggs on a split biscuit covered in a Bay Hollandaise and a generous amount of crab. Mine also included hash potatoes. The crab Benedict was the best thing to grace my taste buds in a long time. The hollandaise sauce had flawless consistency and flavor that paired perfectly with the thick custardardy yolk of the eggs, and decadent richness of the crab. The potatoes are okay, but not as flavorful.   The service was wonderful as well. Our waitress,  Sara, was very friendly and on point. We will definitely be back. In fact this may become our regular Saturday morning breakfast hang out. There are many more items on the menu I cannot wait to try. I was going to take a photo of our plates, but I was so excited when the food came that I just dug right in and forgot all about the photo... LOL",

My Chicken and Waffles were sooo good: waffles with bacon in the batter and crispy leeks on top.  They thought of it all.  I've tried chicken and waffles at many restaurants, and this is by far, one of the best!  I tasted Cole's Eggs Benedict and loved their take on it.

But no, they welcomed our post-hike sweatiness and loud chatter with open arms.   The food was really good. Per a recommendation from our waiter, I got the carnitas hash as well as the hash monkey for the table, and was not disappointed with either. It seems you really cant go wrong with anything on their menu.  As the food was good, what stood above and beyond was the service - specifically our server CJ who knocked our whole experience out of the park. I really believe he is probably top 5 waiters I have ever had. He was so sweet, knowledgable, accommodating and fun!  He made our experience so awesome, and without him, I probably wouldn't even have written a review, but I just have to give him major public kudos. Thank you, CJ!",

It's in the old Cuttlefish building in North Scottsdale. Decor is modern farm to table...trendy. The menu is severely meat friendly. But there are some shrimp and salmon options, as well as the waffles and pancakes. And the every ubiquitous bacon bandwagon.   The coffee was strong and very tasty. But my cup was left empty several times and I actually had to get up and get it myself 2 times. Which is odd because when we needed service, it wasn't there, however, when we were still eating, bus boys kept trying to take our plates away...without asking. We had to verbally stop them 3 times total \"No, I'm not finished eating yet!\". Same with the water glasses, always empty.   I ordered the artichoke fritata. Very dry and flavorless and came to the table not hot, not warm, but kind of on the room temperature side. I rarely put salt on any food I order, so when I have to salt my food, I feel like there's no inherent flavor to enjoy. And several of the artichoke bites were the chewy stem parts so i had a little side pile of artichoke chew and spit outs.   Felt rushed with sub par food.",

This was my first opportunity to come back, due to business travel, and I brought my boyfriend and brother.   We had the most amazing meal today. We clearly caught them on an off day on our last visit - and I'm so glad we came back! Linda and Bonnie were so welcoming and warm and took such wonderful care of us. Linda was a gem, so lovely and enthusiastic and clearly passionate about the restaurant and its service. Our waiter, Zach, was wonderful! He was friendly, attentive, and a superstar. What a huge difference from last time.   We had the most delicious food. I had the herb fried chicken and waffles, my boyfriend had the lump crab frittata and my brother had the Oreo pancakes. We also had, mimosas, iced coffees, and cannoli donuts.  Everything was so excellent. Portions were massive, well cooked, and serious delicious.  I'm thrilled with our experience here, and as a side note, my brother is in a wheelchair and I was SO pleased to see they not only have a family restroom but also the disabled access door buttons on both bathrooms (those are not cheap, and are not required by law). I appreciate that as a patron with a loved one confined to a wheelchair.   Definitely will be coming back, and I'm super excited about their new location on my street! (Frank Lloyd Wright)  Thank you Bonnie, Joey, Linda and Zach!!! You definitely changed my mind about this great restaurant!",

My first visit to the Hash Kitchen, I had an omelet and was very underwhelmed. The potatoes accompanying it seemed soggy and the omelet was mediocre at best. However, I eyed the bloody mary bar while I was there and decided I needed to come back. I went back again and tried the bloody mary bar and ordered a specialized egg benedict. The bloody mary bar is amazing, they had everything from olives to beef jerky to meet balls to put in your drink. It was so much fun and delicious! I would 100% come back again for a drink. That being said, my eggs benedict was even worse than my omelet. The eggs came out hard boiled, not poached, with the same gross potatoes and way too much sauce. The lox on my benedict was fishy and I couldn't even swallow it.   At the end of the day, come here for a drink before breakfast, but don't come here just for breakfast.",

    "text": "This place is popping! Not only do they have a blood Mary bar, but there is a dj right when you walk in. I can see how it might be a little too loud sitting on the inside,but outside was perfect The blood Mary bar is awesome; not only can you pick your own flavored vodka, but there are a ton of toppings. We sat at the patio bar, it was a little chilly, but I can see on a nice day it would be perfect! Manager, Brent, helped us out and make sure that we had everything we needed. The bar is super clean. The food serving was more than enough and delicious. Great customer service. I would definitely come back when we are in town. This place is popping.",

    "text": "A couple weeks ago, my hiking group came her to nosh after doing a trail run at Tom's Thumb even if it was a bit of a drive from there. They have a long but narrow patio and they were so gracious to accommodate my black lab, Arya, who came with us. She was too big to bring over the patio fence and there was no way I'd ask to walk her through the restaurant but our waitress brought iced water to her throughout our meal. Arya luckily was able try some of the flaky biscuits they brought to us and she \"tells\" me they were great!  The lump crab hash over sweet potatoes was very, very good! I'm a sucker for crab and there was plenty of crab in this dish. I enjoyed the food with an espresso and a house Bloody Mary. One of my friends really enjoyed the Bloody Mary bar which obviously gives you the opportunity to personalize how you like you cocktail.   I definitely miss Cuttlefish, and I know it's the same owner but Hash will definitely be a go-to for weekend and post hike brunches from now on.",

The place is nice for Brunch it you can get pass the music which is very loud and you have to speak somewhat loudly to have a conversation. Also the pretentiousness of the bloody mary bar...people made themselves the cocktail & took pictures but I didn't see any of the them actually drink it. We were there for a while because although the waitress was courteous she was slow & took a while to do refills & bring requested items. We waited about 30 minutes to get in initially.

The service not at a level it should be I would say because of being soo busy that you won't get great service not sure if they stretch them to thin or what . I would give this place another try though because I did like most of my food .

Extensive menu with a lot of cool choices. For me I had the tamale cakes (who doesn't love tamales?) sweet corn tamale, green chili pork, poached eggs, green chili hollandaise sauce. The egg poached PERFECTLY and I am insanely picky about my eggs, the green chili pork I found watery and lacking flavor, the hollandaise was okay I expected more of a kick. I guess I was expecting a good balance of savory and sweet and I just didn't get it. For whatever reason it was served with a corn muffin that tasted a lot like the foundation of the tamale hmmm. My friend had the frittata I believe it was the chicken tinga, nice peppers and he liked the chicken it did taste better than my pork. The potatoes slightly underdone for all of our tastes. Bacon and egg burger with hollandaise and Leeks was very good (I had a few bites as my friend had a small appetite) kudos for the fried leeks definitely need that on more menus. The fries that accompanied it were fantastic, thicker than regular fries thinner than steak fries a nice compromise.",

    "text": "Tried Hash Kitchen for the first time this past Thursday. This place is located in a strip-mall parking lot and offers convenient parking and an easy-to-navigate entrance.  We arrived around 10:00am and tables were readily available. The hostess was polite. We were nestled in a corner, quiet with a nice window view.  The waitress left much to be desired. She was more absent than present and seeming disinterested in being there.  We both ordered a breakfast benedict. Mine the salmon, hers the shrimp. Hollandaise on the side with a side of pancakes to split.  Food arrived, the eggs were poached hard. Potatoes with the meal were cold. Pancakes were fine but served with a very limited amount of syrup.   It took nearly 15 minutes to have our eggs remade. At first, they only replaced the eggs of my breakfast-date and not mine... I had to specifically ask to have mine remade. The manager did stop by and apologize for the mistake.   The restaurant is nice and fairly clean - nice ambiance and despite some larger groups, not too loud. The big windows allow for great light. We appreciated the large selection on the menu.  Pros: convenient location, good light / ambiance, despite being cold -  food flavor was ok, nice hostess.  Cons: absent server, cold / incorrect food, not much of an effort to correct by staff.  I'd give this a solid 2.5/5 star rating. Next time, I'll try somewhere else.",

The selection was interesting but everything sounded a little bit better that it actually tasted. The only exception was the filling that came with one of the French toast dishes. Tasted like cannoli cream or something similar and it was yummy!  Portion sizes on two of our three dishes were small, and they were fine, if not memorable. Really just an average breakfast establishment. They do offer a cute \"Make your own Bloody Mary\" bar, but I did not indulge. I will say that our server was very good, and we tipped accordingly.  BIG turn off... The straws are not wrapped and everybody's just grabbing them to stick them in my drink. Hey Hash Kitchen, that is gross!",

The Cannoli Donuts were delicious and a great way to start the meal. One note to make was that the bacon was a little over done. I would recommend explaining exactly how you would like it to be done when they ask if you want it crisp. Overall, this is a great restaurant and would definitely recommend to others!",

    "text": "In Scottsdale from out of town. We had brunch on Sunday - 5 adults and one child.  Nice ambiance and the Bloody Mary bar was FUN and you can build quite a drink for $10.  We got some laughs out of comparing our creations - mine had smoked salmon-infused vodka, bacon salt rim, topped with a raw oyster on the half shell, lots of different olives, bacon, pickled carrots, a pickled egg, and fried oysters.  Very yum!  We had an order of cannoli stop share - creamy and cinnamon-spiced; more like donuts, but delicious.  The food was just adequate for the price - I had the recommended crab and sweet potato hash ($24) and it was good, topped with 2 poached eggs, but not awesome as some reported.  It was served dry (odd) and I had to ask for hollandaise to pour over.  The biscuit with good quality soft butter and some delicious berry jam.  My vegetarian son-in-law had a lot to choose from; I think he had a frittata.  Everyone enjoyed their meals, but didn't think the food was better than other places.  My grandson had breakfast Popsicles and he loved those - how unique is that?  The service was great and they took our reservation, which we appreciated.  I don't think we would go back, with so many choices, though the drink bar was phenom.",

I think the owners wanted it to be a hip-hop dance club vs a restaurant and far too loud which was surprising since it was in a wealthy neighborhood.   Most wealthy people I know prefer their loud hip-hop nusic to stay in the clubs or a ball game, but not at a nice restaurant.   Unfortunately,  we wont be back simply because of the music.",

Maybe there should be another way to rate prices for breakfast places, but paying $12-$15 a plate for breakfast is more than we expected for eggs benedict or a hash dish. Although the food was fairly good, it just wasn't as mind-blowingly good as I had heard it would be or as I would hope it would be for the price. Overall, I have to say that the service was great.

We tried just about everything on the menu and our favorites were Lump Crab and sweet potato hash, the steel cut oats, biscuits and gravy, Quinoa Burger, and the herb chicken hash. Everything was fresh, came out hot, had excellent taste, and left us wanting more! We particularly enjoyed the build your own Bloody Mary bar ( endless bacon and beef jerky, can you say heaven!?) and the crisp mimosas. The service was OUTSTANDING I have never had such attentive staff. We love the Hash kitchen and all its employees!! Thank you Linda!!!  P.S. The atmosphere is amazing with a live jazz band, DJ, and modern decor. We felt very comfortable and quite high class. Pricing is very affordable and we were pleasantly surprised by the menu options :)",

I tried the hash skillet today and it was ok but a little over cooked on the eggs. (Asked for over medium, received hard eggs) I did take the leftovers home.

Don't do it, their salmon is awful. I literally ate one bite and couldn't eat anymore. My server asked if I would like a box and I said no thank you, I didn't really care for it. Her response was 'ok' and took it away. If that were me and my restaurant, I would ask if my guest would like anything else instead and would def remove from the bill.

Service:  I walked in the door and looked a little lost because someone wasn't at their post...but I turned around and seconds later Bonnie walked up to me and apologized and went into welcoming me to The Hash Kitchen. She asked me questions about myself, our trip and where I was visiting while I was in AZ! I felt like a mini celebrity, she complimented, and asked if the bar was okay or if I wanted to sit at a table.  Table please...I sat down and we had an excellent server. (I shouldn't have waited to write this review because I forgot her name, I actually should've gave her a better tip, but I only had a little cash and wanted to tip the Bloody Mary bartender as well (which I did), and another person. This is just how good the service was)   Food:  We had the mini donuts, the sweet potato and crab hash, and the herb fried chicken waffles. Everything was tasty but I did have to add salt in the crab hash, I also wish I could've tasted the herb in the chicken. The chicken was perfectly fried and thick, we definitely were full afterward but not too groggy. Now the Bloody Mary bar was the True highlight, sorry! This was my first Bloody Mary and it will not be my last. At the bar you have the options of which flavored vodka to get, plus you choose your flavored juice, I got lemon infused vodka, and a spicy tomato juice...then the bartender told me to pile it high, as you can't go back, so that's what I did lemons, oysters, bacon and so much more. It took me about 9 minutes to put a perfectly put Bloody Mary together and 18 minutes to drink it. It tasted perfect! Not too strong and not too weak, it was just right!  After everything, I asked to speak with the manager and the young girl looked frazzled. She came up with an alluring and great attitude and asked what she could help me with..I stated this is the best service I've received on any trip, we travel a lot, plus we eat at fine restaurants and this didn't even compare. She gave me a smile and stated a saying and gave/asked* me for a hug! It was 10 stars from there. So you MUST go there. If not for the blood Mary or hash...go for the experience because it will be one!   *I wish I could've taken a picture with everyone, I asked my husband if that would've been weird...I guess you know his answer from me not taking it lol :)  *Go see Bonnie!!!!",

Where I was disappointed was the food, I ordered the lump crab and sweet potato hash, which was a popular item. I love a good hash and the best part is crispy potatoes with soft potato inside. This hash had shredded potatoes with absolutely no crisp On them. The crab I will say was quite tasty and the eggs were all poached. The biscuit it came with was pretty underwhelming as well. I didn't care for The grains of sugar on top and there was no flakiness too it or soft inside. Just kind of a dry rock of a bread item. I don't normally eat bread so when I do I expect it to be worth it. So overall it was a descent meal idea and ingredient wise, but I think the execution was lacking the refinements that take it from mediocre to delicious.",

    "text": "We went in last Sunday expecting to find a new go to spot. Boy were we wrong!   We were not drinking as we had lots of running around to do but they do have a great Bloody Mary bar and the drinks did look great. My daughters chili Benedict's were creative, different and quite good. I had a scramble which was fine. Nothing special, just eggs cheese and raw onions and bell peppers thrown in but I was in the mood for plain so it was just fine but nothing special which again was fine.  The service is what amazed me! Horrific! We waited about 10 mins b4 even asked for drinks, food took quite a long time but maybe that's because it's a drinking spot and the encouragement is to have people drink more. I was in the industry so this may be a thing there. After 40 mins of sitting at our table we got our food and couldn't find the waitress. I sat for quite a while looking around trying to find her to get the condiments I needed for my good while it got cold. Oh and also I'd drank my coffee, actually ended up putting it at end of table to show it was out and I needed another. Never got one. We saw her once at a table next to use, waited till they were done speaking with her and they were in same position I was and not happy. She literally never looked at me, I tried desperately to get her attention and she would have none of it. I noticed she never looked at her table, even a glance, tunnel vision. U can't do that as a waitress. U should always be glancing at your tables when on the floor. Anyway we had to grab other people to eat what we needed. The girl I grabbed was so sweet. The guy I grabbed to get condiments was highly annoyed as he was running his tush off for his tables but he did stop and get us what we needed. I'd be mad if I were him and busy as well but my good was getting cold. She finally came over to the table at the end of the meal, I just wanted out as we'd been there an hour and a half combined. She dropped bill and then suddenly became attentive. Nothing ticks me off more then a waitress who ruins your meal then after dropping the check starts to ask if u need anything. By the way, never noticed the coffee being empty and at the edge of the table, even still!  My daughter begged me not to say anything and to just leave and we did. I did however leave a note of the back of bill that it was the worst service ever and I left the worst tip of my life. I always over tip even for crud service having done this job and for the first time I basically stuffed the girl which I hate but that is how horrific the service was.   I did think the manager was gonna ask at one time how we were. He was at the next table facing us talking to them. At the time I was unable to eat my food yet and figured I could get his attention and ask him, I was staring right at him, he looked up almost made eye contact with me, looked away and walked off to sit by the Bloody Mary bar and chat with staff as he had been doing the entire time mostly. If I were drunk the poor service would've been fine and luckily for them most people in there are drinking but for a sober person who just wants to eat and have decent service, that's not the place to go!   We expected from the reviews to have a great experience, were actually shocked it was so horrific. A waste of valuable time and money! If u wanna drink and catch a buzz where u don't care if u have horrible service then this may be a good place but if u wanna eat and have a decent experience without booze, don't go!",

Don't go if you're hungover, you won't enjoy the DJ, but if you're not... sit at the bar and order yourself a Mimosa flight or cereal shooter flight. So tasty and delicious!  Bloody Mary bar might keep you there longer than you planned to stay. LOL. Service was okay, felt a 'turn and burn' from the server. It was my daughter's 21st birthday, disappointed they didn't do a LITTLE something. Manager kindly offered to take flower bouquets to her office while we dined. Large portions. Several variety of pancakes, but seemed like the pancakes were all the same, other than the topping. The skillet was mostly potatoes, we ordered another egg. I need to give them one more shot.",

What ruined a nice \"relaxing\" breakfast was when a DJ (??) chimed in and started BLASTING HIGH BASEY RAP MUSIC!! WTF???  Sunday morning breakfast to this??  Sorry but not at all expected. Asked manager if they could at least tone it down. Nope, it's \"the charm\" of the place.  Won't go back.",

    "text": "Since I really enjoyed their other location, I was really looking forward to coming here for brunch.  I make sure to visit here with a friend just to try their mimosa flight. $16 mimosa flight comes with 4 regular serving of mimosa. My favorite this time was cherry. All others were just okay. I still like their strawberry when they have one.  On Sunday, expect at least 30 mins to 45 mins wait. They will quote you approximately how long the wait, they have chairs and water outside to help you wait.  I tried lump crab Benedict. I had their lump hash before and wanted to try benedict this time. I would have preferred if they have more hollandaise sauce and just a bit more crab. Not really well balanced, at least more sauce would have been better.   If you arrive late, they might run out of some of the dishes. I wanted to try their famous breakfast lasagna but I guess I need to start my day a bit early to try that next time.  Service here is always good. Despite of being really busy, they do well",

He offered to compensate me with a coupon for my next visit which I was not expecting- but I guess I was never going to receive it anyways as I never heard back from him after his initial message. A phony move for lack of better words.   I'm not looking any hands out. I don't need the coupon; I'm not even sure if I would've gone back to use it. But I've read many similar reviews to mine about lack of quality, overpriced subpar food, with an unorganized system at the host stand. Hopefully the owner gains some integrity and finds better structure as he leads the success of his business.",

The corned beef was good, although I felt it should've been cooked a little longer. It's a prettty big portion too. Omg the fruity pebbles cocktail was amazing!

However it's not overbearing, you can still have a conversation without yelling. Great vibe, lovely decor and friendly service.  My favorite dish was the fruit, it was almost too pretty to eat. Emphasis on the almost. Prices are average and food quality is high. Gotta try the mimosa flight!  tip- check in on yelp for discount on check",

This was actually a waffle with stuffing inside topped with mashed potatoes, real turkey, gravy and fried leeks. A total homerun indeed at about $14. We also enjoyed the banana brioched French toast, but I wish November would last longer, so I could go back and try this again. Props to the kitchen on this Thanksgiving winner.",

They need to open one of these in Los Angeles!   Things to try...their hash skillets, scrambles, and eggs Benedict. If you're a boozy bruncher, than the Build Your Own Bloody Mary Bar is cool or the Mimosa Flights is tasty. They also have breakfast cereal shooters, coconut milk infused with vodka or rum and different cereals. Sooooooo yummy!!!   Ohhh and they have a DJ playing great music the whole time!!!   I'm telling you, you gotta come here if you're in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.",

Everyone who works here now, with the exception of perhaps two people, are new hires and will be moving to their respective Hash Kitchen locations once they've opened (Chandler and Phoenix).  I've decided to update my review, since I am not able to update any new photos (the link to add is, currently, permanently grey and won't let me post).  As regular HK patrons know, the menu usually has a few new items added.  I spotted \"Benedict Fries\" on my latest visit, so I decided to try it.  It's basically French fries with toppings of what you'd typically find in a Benedict: poached eggs, sliced ham, peppered bacon bits, and hollandaise sauce.  Delicious, and the poached eggs were the best eggs I've ever had that that weren't my mother's perfected scrambles!  I usually try to avoid eating as much egg whites as I can (I order a two-egg scramble prepared with one full egg and an extra egg yolk, for example), but I could eat these poached eggs in their entirety!  My only complaint was that these thin French fries were too soggy AND greasy for my liking.    My all-time favorite Coconut-almond encrusted French toast are almost-always perfect, since someone in the kitchen knows just the way I like them prepared.  I will do my very best to follow him wherever he may land!    Will return in a couple of days to try another new menu item!",

The waitlist on the Yelp app said the current wait time was \"0 mins\" all the way up until we parked. We get inside and the wait is an hour - Whoa.  Let's also add the 45 minutes it took for our friends to get here from the other side of town. I guess it's a good thing drinks are easily accessible. Otherwise, I don't think we would have waited.  Another disappointment: They got rid of the lump crab eggs benedict. Please bring it back.  The prosecco smash drinks were yummy. Essentially prosecco, berry puree, blueberries and strawberries.   My fiance and I shared the breakfast sandwich and the fried chicken eggs benedict. I would get the fried chicken eggs benedict again because the chicken was pretty good. The sandwich was just okay - nothing spectacular.",

Coffee was tasty and fresh. For food, wife ordered a half order of Oreo pancakes and eggs over easy. I ordered the most popular item on the menu per our waitress, the Carnitas Hash. Wife thought Oreo pancakes were average. I tasted and I agree with her. Although they were good, there's better places for pancakes. Batter probably mixed with water. I enjoyed the Carnitas hash. They gave me a lot of carnitas which is very cool. The fried onions (think of Frenchies) is not a good addition per my taste buds as it sweetened the dish which I wasn't looking for. I took the fried onions off and the dish was much better.   We will come back as the service is great, the coffee is tasty and the food was tasty. I'm looking forward to trying different items next time like the bread pudding French toast.",

My husband got a bacon-infused vodka Bloody Mary and I had a strawberry mimosa - both were soo good. The menu is awesome - everything from sweet to savory and so much to choose from. I thoroughly enjoyed the Hash McMuffin although I could only eat half! My husband had the carnitas hash which was recommended by our server, who did a great job giving us suggestions since we are first-timers! In addition to the fresh, fun atmosphere and wonderful food and drinks, the manager Dominic was so kind and we truly enjoyed talking to him. What a great guy and an outstanding example of how a restaurant manager should engage with patrons. It made our experience that much more enjoyable. We did come on a Friday and heard this place is PACKED on Saturday/Sunday, so expect a wait! They have cool misters outside though :) Will definitely return next time we are in town!",

The tamale cakes were such a unique twist on an eggs benedict dish. The sweet corn base was light and flavorful, and the green chili pork was SO tender and good. I think this dish was worth every penny, and wasn't too much food to leave me feeling like I'd overeaten!  The bruschetta was fun to eat. Three different types, each sweet and perfect to share. If it weren't so far from where I live, I'd be back more often! Although the restaurant was packed, we still had  reliable service. Looking forward to sitting inside next time, rather than outside in the desert summer air. For an extremely warm day, I was surprised that there weren't any misters on our side of the patio.",

So, I came home and found the contact information for corporate and sent an email. Waited 3 days... crickets... no follow up. Sent a follow up email...crickets... no response. What kind of customer service completely ignores a customers concern. The least they could have done was responded to the email!

    "text": "WOW WOW WOW  Came here for brunch on a Sunday after reading all the rave reviews on Yelp and I'm so glad I did!! One of the best brunches I've ever had -- ready for them to open a location in Atlanta so I can go all the time!!  I had read reviews saying that the place starts to pack up around 10 because that's when the DJ shows up so we got the restaurant around 9:40. We had a 15/20 minute wait which was totally fine because it gave us time to look over the menu and at different foods as they came out of the kitchen! When we were leaving though around 11 the place was completely packed and there were so many people waiting outside -- not sure how long the wait was but it had to be at least an hour based on how many people were waiting. Once seated service was decent, but since it was so packed I understand why service wasn't great especially towards the end.   They have a giant Bloody Mary bar with over 67 toppings, but since my boyfriend and I don't like bloody marys we opted for mimosas instead. They have four of five different flavors to choose from, along with a mimosa flight option! Since we couldn't decide what we wanted we ordered way too much but got to try a bunch of things. First we ordered the canoli donuts and they were INCREDIBLE!!!! So thick and sweet, perfectly made and delicious. 100% would order again. Next we got the bacon board which was really good to. They served the bacon with this jam that was wonderful! For our meals we ordered the carnitas hash and salmon fritata. The hash was also very good -- huge portion so definitely can share between people if ordering other appetizers and full of flavor. The salmon fritata wasn't very good and I probably wouldn't order again. However since the other foods we got were so good they totally made up for it. There's so many things to try on the menu though we definitely had a hard time ordering! Everything sounds amazing!  Love this place and wish I lived in Scottsdale so I could go again!",

Positives: our waitress was nice and they had a really cool Bloody Mary bar with all of the accoutrements that you could hope for. The gravy on the biscuits and gravy was very flavorful. Our eggs were cooked perfectly.   Negatives:  My bacon was chewy like jerky and the biscuits were very dry and dense.  The potatoes were tiny little boring cubes. While our waitress was nice, she was not attentive at all, and actually never came back to the table after dropping our food until it was time to bring the bill.   Overall I would probably not return here but my husband said he would give it one more try.",

Their Bloody Mary bar is huge and has a wide variety of toppings to add to your customized drink! They have different infused vodkas and different spice levels for the mix. It's so fun to design your own drink! The food is also amazing! I came with my family the day after Thanksgiving and we all shared and enjoyed the food we ordered. I would, however, advise that if you're decided between a scramble or a has, that you pick the hash. The scrambler is less integrated as a dish and I felt as though there was a lot less food. There are so many hash options, but my favorites are definitely the fried chicken and carnitas. The fried chicken and waffle was delicious as well. The waffle is made Belgium style, so the outside is crispy and the inside is soft!  My boyfriend ordered the s'mores French toast and it was the perfect sweet treat. There was marshmallow fluff both on top and between the two slices of French toast!  I will definitely be back again soon!",

We got there a few minutes before our reservation time of 1 o'clock to find out that they were running 45 minutes to an hour late on their reservations. We finally got seated at 2:15. An hour after taking our orders they came back to say that they had run out of some things. Then they brought out several wrong orders. We had to send back more than half of our food. The biscuits on my salmon beni were raw inside. The salmon was dry. The doughnuts were hard on the outside and still raw doughy on the inside. We left at 4 and went out to our favorite sushi restaurant instead. This truly was the worse Mothers Day meal ever.",

I really wish I could give a review of what looks like great food, but I wouldn't know seeing as the hostesses forgot about us after we had been waiting for a little more than an hour to eat. We arrived expecting 6 people to show up, but as soon as we knew there'd be less we let the hostesses know there'd be 4 instead. Our buzzer went off right as we went up to change it again to add one more and she said she'd reset it for us when they would have a bigger table available. We were very upfront and flexible as we knew the number of our group was being unpredictable against our will. We were very present and proactive about this. So you wouldn't think we'd be easily forgotten. So we sat and sat and sat. Soon we noticed that a large group who was there after us got seated outside. The tables were even pushed together for them. We were told that that wasn't possible. We brought that to the attention of both women and noticed that our name had already been crossed off and other large groups were put before us. The women proclaimed that they never said that we couldn't sit outside and that they would never say it to begin with. We received no apology and they never admitted a fault. We left right away and went and had fantastic crepes and French cuisine right across the parking lot instead.  Also, don't expect to socialize comfortably with family etc as the music on Sunday mornings is obnoxiously loud and unnecessary. If that's your thing, then more power to you.",

The sauce turned out to be Tomatillo Salsa, not green chile.",

You know the food is good when it tastes better or just as good the next day/reheated! No really, it does! I always get the almond/coconut encrusted French toast and because there is no way I can eat it all in one sitting, I always have leftovers and look forward to enjoying it the next day.  Whenever I have visitors, I am sure to take them to Hash Kitchen and everyone has always left full and satisfied! Oh, an extra bonus, is the very friendly manager/owner who is super sweet!  I would definitely recommend this place!",

We ordered the hash chicken and lemon ricotta pancakes. Then the drinks... if your a fan of bloody Mary's they have a whole make your own bar with great selections to choose from. We tried the flight mimosa and the strawberry was awesome! Do yourself a favor and check this place out!!",

We were able to enjoy an impressive Bloody Mary bar (yumm!) while we waited to be seated. The restaurant was filled with laughter, conversation, and upbeat music. My 4 year old was beyond excited when she saw... wait for it.... The Easter Bunny himself!! We were seated in Jen's section and our service couldn't have been any better! She was attentive and friendly. I was recommended the French toast, and let me just say that I am sure glad that I listened! We were a party of 10, and we all agreed that it was one of (if not) the BEST breakfast food that we had ever had. Upon our departure we were thanked by Annie and Bonnie with the sweetest hugs and smiles! We live about 30 miles from the restaurant, but I promise that we will be back! Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for making this special occasion with my family so memorable!",

    "text": "2 1/2 maybe.  Would I try again, yes.  The atmosphere and even the music is all good.  However, you guys rave like this is the best breakfast spot in Phoenix and Scottsdale.  It's not.  Tons of others places that are better just look on Yelp.  Every edge of the valley from Matt's downtown to the Farmhouse in Gilbert.  The service is terrible.  We saw our server when he took our order and when we got the check.  That's it and it was clear that he couldn't have cared less.  We wanted an OJ and mimosa plus an egg added to our tab but we couldn't get anyone to pay attention and stop for two seconds.  Now the food.  The chicken and waffles are overrated.  I liked the waffle but the chicken is actually very sweet.  Look, you already get maple syrup on the plate so no need to be excessive with the sugar angle.  The contrast is what makes chicken and waffles great.  Also, maybe use a slightly heartier piece of chicken instead of it being pounded so thin or whatever it is you're doing.  Chilaquiles, spelling?, actually pretty good but not close to traditional but everybody has their take on a dish so it is what it is.  Maybe less chicken over the top.  Now the Bloody Mary bar.  Boy, this must be your profit center.  What a waste of money.  Low quality vodka with either a mild or spicy tomato base and profile.  Lots of crap you can add for garnish but you're missing one key element.  A great Bloody Mary is about the spices and flavors in the mix and yours is bland at best.  This is not a Bloody Mary bar as much as it is a garnish bar.  Throw some garlic powder, onion powder, a couple hot sauces etc up there so you can change the taste of the base because it needs help. The place is packed and it's a good  location but two breakfasts, two drinks, an OJ and we are at $75.  Look at my reviews and you'll see that I have actually never mentioned price because I am happy to spend money on a great meal and experience.  This was not worth it.  Plus, I eat at great breakfast joints all over the west coast.  Also, my reviews are a majority excellent reviews not bad ones,  I feel it's important to not only complain about a bad experience but give people credit when they do a good job.  Go for yourself but gotta tell you that we are in no rush to go back here.",

Let's start with the BYOB Bloody Mary bar. A choice of like 5 infused vodkas. I, of course, choice the bacon vodka. They have garnishes from bacon to oysters to capresse skewers to beets to Gouda. All to say.... Amazing! Then there is the food that is not found in my beverage...I got the brisket hash that was made by the bbq place next store, which hash also owns. Green chilies, brisket, cornbread potato hash with poached eggs. Yum!!! The manager, Linda, who is now on my top 10 favorite people ever, brought over some homemade bbq sauce to eat use on my hash... Some of the best bbq sauce I have ever had and this means something from someone who basically bleeds bbq! My hash came with a fresh biscuit that I ended up eating even though I was so full! My mom got the corned beef hash which was everything God intended it to be! The food at Hash Kitchen goes above and beyond your exceptional brunch. Not only is the food here amazing and every bite delusions, but the people here take it that extra step! We greeted by 2 lovely woman that were genuinely excited we were there! The manager sat us and brought us water and also introduced us to the restaurant and the menu. She was warm and knowledgeable. Linda. Linda is the manager as well as the giver of sauce! She is the one who hooked me up with the bbq sauce. The bartender who helped me with the Bloody Mary bar was incredible! We gave me samples and walked me through every step of creating my personal Bloody Mary. Our waitress was adorable and very helpful. Love this place so much that I will be back here on Friday and probably Sunday too... Thank you Hash Kitchen, not for the bigger pants size that I will now have to attain, but for reminding me what Sunday brunch should be.",

ANYWAY...let's start with the bloody Mary bar...I'm a sucker for a good bloody Mary..this place does not disappoint! I went through myself the first time and tried the jalapeno vodka and added celery salt and a pickle and piece of bacon etc and loved my drink. While I was enjoying my drink and knew I may run out, breakfast was served.  I went back to the bloody Mary bar and while I was in line our waiter  came up to me and said \"go back to your table, I will make your drink so you can eat without your food getting cold and bring it to your table.\" He then asked for my drink choices and garnishments and I have to say, he nailed it and I had two of the best Bloody Mary's of my life here. So, on the food front...I later went to urgent care the same day and was told I had a sinus infection, so the fact that I felt like the food I ate was some of best ever on like like 33% of my taste buds is saying something. I'm a sucker for short ribs, so I ordered the Benedict with the short ribs and I have to say it was one of the best things I have ever eaten. My companions were confused as to whether I was disgusted or in delight...I can assure you I was in delight. Seriously yummy! I only wish they were on my side of town, but according  to our waiter they have a Chandler location opening soon! I hope so!",

I've had this at like 4 other places but this is the best ever!  Mimosas - out of this world.   Food, I had a skillet, someone had eggs Benedict, chicken and waffles and a croch monsure (spelling. ??) - everything was out of this world. This kitchen is killing it!!!!   But it gets down to the staff, some of the nicest I have ever met in a restaurant.   Go and enjoy!   Thank you for a great meal.",

The last time I was there was for a business meeting and when they put the plate down in front of me I could smell the salmon in the eggs Benedict was completely rancid. Rancid! It was a Herculean feat not to puke while the putrid fish sat on the plate in front of me. So as not to offend my host I attempted to eat around the fish but everything else was covered in mounds of raw onions. Bless the hundred-year-old coffee server lady for filling my cup every 37 seconds otherwise I would've starved to death that day.",

Next time I'm trying the Bloody Mary bar - I don't normally like them but I got to sample and it was delicious.

Everyone loved their dishes and we were even able to accommodate my daughter who is vegan. Our attentive server Colton and the managers were on active duty to ensure our holiday breakfast was to perfection! They delivered and we all said -- we must YELP this bunch. I apologize for not remembering everyone's names. I had a shrimp eggs benedict with asparagus but what looked the most amazing choice was the huge, meaty pastrami sandwich! Everyone was very happy with their meals! The bloody mary bar is a must! We piled on jalepeno poppers, meatballs, bacon, celery, veggies, pickles into a fine art form of wonder! There was some confusion as to who our server was  at first and they apologized to us with some creamy donut deliciousness appetizer on the house! This is a well run, attention to the details kind of place! Keep up the customer service and incredible food. We sat out on the patio enjoying a sunny, 70's Christmas day that was divine. Thank you Hash Kitchen and to all your staff-- even the bartender at the Bloody Mary bar was personable!",

    "text": "Ugh. The note below is probably why your restaurants are always empty.  You did NOT understand the situation. You asked me no questions about why we were getting frustrated and did not give your hostess a chance to explain the situation to you. You merely interjected when he came up to the counter upset and then you dismissed us with zero apology. What kind of customer service is that? I might have expected that from a shift manager, which is what I thought you were based on your behavior, but never a restaurant owner.   What my boyfriend said to your hostess was \"she didn't even offer to put our name down.\" Valid complaint. Was his tone the best? Probably not. But we expected basic service which you didn't deliver. You, Mrs. Restaurant owner, are the one to blame for not training your staff well. Your actions were ruder than both my boyfriends and your hostesses actions. Unacceptable.   We were willing to wait. Like I said, we were excited to come try out your restaurant, but we were not even given the opportunity to wait. Where was the wait time? Neither you nor your hostess gave me that until I had to ask several times.   The fact that you had two similar instances within the matter of a few days should tell you that there is a problem with your service. Larry probably wanted to wait as well but was not given a chance. Service complaints are so easily rectifiable. Your hostess has had three similar complaints on here in the last two weeks. Train your staff.  Finally, way to go and get your friend, Yvonne, to write a review about your restaurant to counter mine. Very professional. Just like your response. Zero friends, two reviews, the other one for your failed restaurant, Cuttlefish? Nice try.  People - don't waste your time here. You can get a better Bloody Mary cart at The Henry. A better breakfast at Butterfields. And better service anywhere else. This plaza for example: Soi 4, Chez Vous Crepe, POMO, Naya... hell, I will even go to Pei Wei. You're in a spot with a lot of competition, lady. Step it up.   Again. One star, well deserved.",

    "text": "I was not nearly as bowled over by this place as I wanted to be....  Met up with a dear friend on Sunday for hash...one of my favorite dishes in the world.  I arrived early and got seated immediately.  Our server gave me water, then ignored me for the next 20 minutes.  Luckily the owner's wife came by and got me some coffee, which was great.  My friend arrived and we ordered as our server had miraculously appeared.  He seemed to have a limited knowledge of the menu as he could make few recommendations and told my friend that the restaurant didn't make something that was clearly on the menu.  We both ordered hash...mine was crab with sweet potato and my friend's was traditional.  Mine was bland and flavorless; I ordered a side of hollandaise to spice it up but it had no flavor either.  Both of us agreed that texture also played a big part in our overall dissatisfaction as well.  As the queen of brunch, I fully expected to be able add Hash Kitchen to the restaurant rotation but am not thinking so now.  Bummer.",

The corn bread was sweet and the potatoes were savory. It was the best thing I've eaten in a long time. The coffee is very good. My wife had the lemon ricotta pancakes, which were sweet and light.   I'd wholeheartedly recommend this place. They have two small outdoor patios that look like a nice place to eat breakfast. The atmosphere inside was a little formal for breakfast and the music was strange (greatest hits of the 90s for some weird reason). But the staff made up for it with excellent service and the food was spectacular. I'll be back for sure.",

The decorations and ambience inside are very upbeat and led me to believe the process were going to be much higher than the $$ rating on yelp, but they weren't.  We were a party of six adults and two children under five.  The hostess (possibly management or owner) came over immediately to offer crayons and high chairs and chatted with us and the kids which made everyone feel right at home.  The waitress was very attentive and suggested the bloody Mary bar which four of us tried and it was well worth it. Great selection and even had a virgin option at a reduced rate for the pregnant lady in our group.  Only one person had an issue with their meal; biscuits in their biscuits and gravy were a bit doughy but we didn't complain because everything else was so good.  When the waitress was handling the checks she noticed the b&g had barely been touched so she asked if they tasted ok.  We explained the biscuits were a little undercooked and that it wasn't a big deal.  The waitress apologized and left to get the checks.  When we paid I realized they completely removed that item from the bill - without saying anything about it.  That is service like we rarely see these days.  It's obvious they really care about your experience at their establishment and they take ownership over their guests' level of satisfaction.    I would've been excited over a small discount on the meal - it wasn't ruined because the vast majority (including another order of b&g that came out fine) of the meal came out perfect - but they insisted on making it prefect.  Bravo.  I'll be back if I'm ever in the area again!",

The black and white decor coupled with the attention to design and detail is so captivating and creates for an upscale brunch environment throughout the week.  Food: The Banana Foster French toast was definitely a Devine dish. It was cool to perfection and the added Nutella and cream was scrumptious.  The pancakes and fries were also tasty.  The coffee was not my favorite yet the presentation was nice. The pineapple orange mimosa was yummy.  I have found the servers to be accommodating but not quite friendly.  This is surely a place to visit if you are in the Arizona area.",

They found out we were from Texas and they told us all the unique places to see, eat and do in Sedona! They recommended some great food at their restaurant and we were impressed ! We ordered the classic French toast, it was so soft and fluffy. It had the perfect amount of powdered sugar and warm syrup that is very important lol. The potatoes were excellent and the bacon was everything. The highlight was the mimosa flights. For 16 bucks we were definitely tipsy. This is my first time having such unique mimosas. The flight includes a strawberry, kiwi, blueberry and orange mimosas. The restaurant was so cute inside as well a must try !!",

The place has a DJ on the weekends and the music is pumping which makes it feel like you just rolled out of the club into daylight and you're definitely ready for a Bloody Mary and some skillets, egg benedict or waffles, which are all available!!  I had an AH MAZING Carnitas hash skillet which I could barely eat half of. It was amazingly delicious!   I attached a photo which is all that's needed to describe it!

My mom and I had brunch yesterday and our meal was so good, and the vibe of the restaurant was so fun, it left me yearning to go back soon!   Ambiance: -The decor is bright and fresh, and they even have a disco ball hanging above the live DJ booth  -I don't mind it much, but the music is pretty loud. You'll have to strain a bit to carry a conversation, but it keeps you from hearing all the conversations around you so that's a plus in my book -The dining area lends very well to documenting your cute brunch for instagram or other social media platforms. Even the mugs are cute!  -There is outdoor seating, and they have a dog friendly patio!  Of course, the Food: -Their drip coffee is actually excellent and I love that they leave the pot with you so you don't have to ask for refills every time, and the coffee mugs are HUGE! Little things like that provide a more welcoming environment and I appreciate that -The Avocado Toast: AMAZING! Thick cut brioche, avocado, pulled pork, crispy bacon, and so many yummy crunchy toppings!! The portion was HUGE and I couldn't even finish one toast before I was stuffed! Such a great value for the price, and the flavors build so well!  -Christina's Tamale Cakes: My mom's favorite dish on the menu! She was raving about it as soon as we opened our menus and not even 2 minutes later, our waiter came over and recommended the tamale cakes which are like an eggs Benedict but with a Mexican flair. Obviously this is a popular menu item, and rightfully so! The texture, the flavors, are all spot on! This is a must order!  Service: -For the life of me I can't remember our server's name, but he was excellent! Very attentive, always greeted us with a smile, and took care of any requests we had in a timely manner. For how busy the dining room was when we arrived, he handled everything extremely well, and we felt well cared for.  -I forgot to mention my 5% off coupon for checking in on yelp during our meal, and the server had to revise the check for us, but he was so kind and accommodating about it!   Overall, our meal at Hash Kitchen was incredible and we can't wait for our next brunch here!",

The potatoes tasted like when you try to re-heat French fries.  My husband ordered the corned beef hash after all,  the place is called \"Hash\" Kitchen.  I would hate to think it was canned(?) but it was mushy and didn't appear to have been put on a grill at all....rather just mushy and warm.  The Bloody Mary bar is a thumbs up!

    "text": "This was the second time I have visited this location. Once last January on a Sunday morning for brunch and then during the week (Thursday morning) for brunch. When we visited in January of 2018, it was very busy and we waited for a great meal. This time we visited on a Thursday, they were also very busy but there was no wait. We were quickly seated in the bar area. My daughter and I shared three things: a Mimosa flight, a carnitas hash, and ricotta lemon pancakes.   So, to begin, the Mimosa flight had four different mimosas-classic, kiwi, blueberry, and strawberry. All were good. The flights have a generous serving and I am sure if I drank the whole flight I would have been tipsy.   The carnitas skillet was good. There was a sufficient amount of meat in the skillet and the potatoes were cooked well---not overdone as sometimes happens with hash when you order out. My only complaint about the skillet was the eggs were ordered over easy and they were closer to over well. When I broke the yolk, there was very little creamy yolk. The top of the skillet was covered with freshly fried onion strings. The lemon ricotta pancakes were light and fluffy and very good.   When we ordered the mimosa flight, the server checked my daughter's ID and saw she had turned 21 three days earlier so she brought her a birthday dessert (not that dessert was necessary after all we had eaten). What came out was a cannoli donut--it was amazing--warm dough filled with traditional cannoli cream and dusted with powdered sugar. It is listed on the menu as a starter. Would recommend.   The menu here is creative and there are a lot of different choices. Even picky eaters could find something to enjoy. Will be back when we are in this neck of woods.",

I came here with a group of 8 for brunch over a bachelorette weekend and this was a perfect addition to the weekend. We had a bit of a wait since they don't take reservations ahead of time but the DJ and bloody mary bar really made the wait seem like nothing. The ambiance of the place was fantastic. If you are in the area and have the time - I highly recommend this place.   The portions are huge and the music is loud but both of those were a plus for me.",

I let a friend visiting AZ pick a spot for us after giving her a few options including HK and super glad she did! It's been on my \"to eat\" Yelp list for awhile. We arrived mid-morning in hopes there wouldn't be a long way... in fact there was no wait for us at all shockingly! The hostess was killing it with her dance moves to the music their Sunday DJ was pumping and paused momentarily to greet us and escort us to our two-top. #hashhashbaby  Music, cold brew coffee and hot food are just what we needed. Oh and mimosas! Get the mimosa flight! We split it (without asking for particular flavors) and I could've had an entire one to myself, but we were responsible. The cold brew coffee had a nice perk and wasn't burnt tasting like a particular national coffee I frequent. If I liked drinking liquid tomato and booze, I would've hit up their massive Bloody Mary bar. Their sides for it are killer, enough for a meal in of itself!    We took forever to decide what to order to actually eat because all of the HK Hashes sound appetizing. I went with the Carnitas as our waitress told me to (#noragrats). Couldn't finish it because it's so much food! My friend ordered another massive plate that she too could not finish. Glad we could chit-chat and enjoy together the Sunday vibes of Hash Kitchen.",

Outdoor seating is a must if you don't want to be stuck inside listening to their loud DJ blasting music.. Server was friendly but annoyed. Didn't have the patience for us newcomers who didn't know the menu.   We ordered 2 entries and a gluten free waffle. When they brought out the entrees, they gave us the wrong one at first and fixed their mistake within minutes..  Huevos rancheros hash was good, balanced flavors and the cilantro seared steak was tender.  Sage fried chicken hash was greasy, flavorless, and had too much leeks.  Gluten free waffle was delicious, best part of the meal. I would come back to eat it again.   Side Note:  * The biscuits are great, worth the extra calories! Moist, buttery goodness. * The ladies that work up in the front are kind and energetic. They did a good job keeping up with the rush.",

The delicious breakfast smells started to hit my nose and i knew i had arrived. I hurried to my table and order the Herb Fried Chicken and Waffle. Everything about that dish was good the chicken was fried to perfection while remaining juicy also the their maple syrup reduction really brought everything together. It was a perfect mix of savory and sweet. The next time i find myself in Arizona i will definitely hit Hash Kitchen again.",

Well we shelved the training ride and came to the Hash Kitchen.  Why else would you come here but to have Hash at the Hash Kitchen.  Ordered two coffees and went from there, there's too many things on this menu that I would find extraordinarily divine.  It's really too bad I'm a man with but one stomach.  I found it hard deciding which Hash to go for but settled on the Rancheros Hash.  This isn't your normal Huevos Rancheros with some papas added in.  Oh no.  So let's break it down from the bottom to the top: Papas, Tortilla, Fried Eggs, Black Beans, Carne Asada, Chile Suace, and Cotija...if that doesn't knock you out I don't know what does.  My girlfriend ordered the Tomaso's Italian Sausange Frittata and it was perfect.  Yum.  Something was off though, I'm not sure, but it would push this over the top.  I shall investigate and re-assess.  Or maybe it was the 2.75 coffee.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Hash Kitchen for SO long, so as soon as we had a free weekend morning to go, we tried it out! The restaurant itself is in a nice location and very pretty. I love the sayings they have written on the wall and the patio is awesome! We got a great table (and were seated right away on a Sunday morning, even though they were pretty busy!) that was right on the edge of the patio, so we still got the sun but it was a little bit cooler.   A huge part of why I wanted to come to Hash Kitchen was for the mimosa flights, but the reason I'll go back is for the waffles :) I just got the classic waffle, but it was amazing! Perfectly filling and sweet and buttery and delicious. The best I've had in a long time for sure. The mimosa flight was tasty too, and you get very good-sized glasses. Today the flight was original, guava, strawberry and mango - normally I don't even like mango that much, but it was definitely my favorite! I'd highly recommend it.   My boyfriend did a make-your-own scramble and had it with cheese, zucchini and black beans and he really enjoyed it as well. It comes with a great biscuit too. We also each had the HK potatoes on the side, which were nothing special, but good! You also get a lot of them considering they're a reasonably priced side. He also got a Bloody Mary (just the classic) and said it was the best he'd had in a while!   I think next time we come we'll skip the drinks because it makes for an expensive breakfast, but I can't wait to go back for the waffle :)",

I've visited both locations and the service is stellar, the food is delicious, the drinks are heavenly, the DJ played some jams that kept us moving or talking, the vibe is insane!  A damn good time for sure!  This was second time visiting with a large group.  The staff was some accommodating both visits and very attentive to the entire group.  We never had to ask for everything.  Either the server or management were so on it with drink refills, ketchup request, jam request, anything!  They were awesome.  I can't remember our server name (a really tall, nice, soft spoken guy) but Amy and Bonnie were exceptional.  Bonnie is a hoot!  She's a really good time ... you can tell by the pictures.   I can't remember if the other location features a Bloody Mary Bar but this one does for sure.  I don't drink Bloody Mary's but my goodness they were soooo many toppings and fixings for your Bloody Mary.  I noticed bacon strips, meatballs or sausages (Not sure), celery, carrots, cucumbers, fruit, so many things.  The fact that there were so many fixings for your Bloody Mary made me want to try it for the heck of it but I chickened out.  Next time maybe.  I really like the \"unknown\" variety of mimosas.  I'm saying unknown because you have no idea of what kind of mimosa will be featured for the day.  This past Sunday it was the classic, kiwi, blueberry and mango.  Blueberry and Mango were our favorites.  On my last visit, it was the classic, pomegranate, guava, and mango.  So, I'm sure each visit you'll get to try something new.   It was 10 of us in my party.  We ordered a variety of dishes.  The Carnita Hash dish came highly recommended.  4 of the 10 ordered and LOVED it.  We also ordered the Blackened Shrimp Hash (looks and taste delicious), the Corned Beef Hash (a classic and my personal favorite), Veggie Scramble, Waffles, and Breakfast Cannoli (my goodness ... so damn good).  Everything, everything was tasty.   Our reservations were for 10:30am.  I got there around 10:15 and I heard the wait was about 30 mins or so I would highly recommend reservations if possible.  We'll give it a few Sundays but we're definitely heading back to Hash Kitchen VERY soon!",

I met our waitor Derek at the Sicilian Butcher, an amazing restaurant I went to the night before. He suggested that I check out The Hash and I'm so glad I did.  Service was so prompt and the manager even greeted us at the table. I ordered a half order of the lemon ricotta pancakes and Cristina's Tamale Cakes, an eggs Benedict on a sweet corn cake with green chile and pork. My mother ordered the chicken and waffles.   The pancakes were light and fluffy with the perfect amount if citrus and sweetness from the mascarpone. You don't even need the syrup. I want to give Christina the biggest hug because that was the best eggs Benedict I've ever had in my life. Omg! This place is so awesome and I can't wait to visit in the future.",

I was out in Scottsdale in November for my friend's bachelorette party and was recommended this place by a friend.  The reviews also made me want to come here.  So on Sunday we headed over & surprisingly didn't have a long wait!  We were told over an hour but it ended up only being 30 mins or less.  Great service!!  Bonnie was such a great hostess making sure everyone was having a great time.  Our waiter was also super nice.  We all ordered mimosas and then realized let's switch it to a sampler since we ordered different flavors.  I found our waiter & he had already done that for us.  Talk about customer service!   The Bloody Mary bar looked amazing too.  It's actually a bar with someone behind the counter giving you your preferred choice of alcohol.  Then you walk around the bar and add your toppings.  A couple of us ended up getting one to share & it was tasty.  Although having a bartender make the drink always tastes better!   I can't remember what I ordered but it was delicious!  We had the booth seat near the DJ and I loved his cap; it said #Hash !! Although I expected more of a party style place it was still a great experience. Bonnie was definitely entertaining & friendly!",

The only complaints I have are that it's quite pricey and the Bloody Mary bar is basically a one-time refill kinda deal. They warn you about this when you go up there so it's not a surprise in that sense, but I've been to other build-your-own Bloody Mary bars that let you refill your drink with toppings as often as you like so this stood out to me.  As for my own order, I had the sweet potato-lump crab hash. It was very flavorful and light, so I didn't feel too full after I finished it. I also had the mimosa flight, which was delicious! I loved the guava the most and really liked how they put a slice of strawberry on the rim of the glass of strawberry mimosa, same thing for orange.   The service was fast, efficient, and our waiter was friendly. They take reservations which is a plus since our group was quite big (8). Overall, it's a fun place for a nice brunch (:",

Comes with all the toppings plus more. Also got the carnitas hash and the corned beef hash. Incredible :) THANK YOU Hash Kitchen.",

    "text": "Yummy! My friend and I had brunch here and ordered two of their hash dishes. Both were delicious. I ate all of mine and my friend took it to the condo and finished it the next day.   The only criticism, we sat outside not realizing it was a dog friendly patio. Some lady sat close to us with an untrained aggressive large German Shepard that she 'corrected' in a baby voice. This dog was not only aggressive towards the other dogs in the patio but jumped and growled at a number of unsuspecting people who were walking past or trying to get into the restaurant (there was a wall by where she sat so anyone walking down the sidewalk could not see her or the dog). I believe that the staff should've asked this lady and her dog to leave but they didn't. So the whole time we sat there eating, the dog barked and growled, meanwhile the owner was talking to it in baby tones saying it was being silly for barking but not taking any responsibility that it scared several older customers who were trying to get into the restaurant.",

It's a fun place to start the morning though the the blue doy Mary bar is amazing. This place would really benefit from adding some vegan options or more healthy choices in general, I had the oatmeal, which wasn't bad, but t was oatmeal. The chicken and waffles and the s'mores French toast looked pretty tasty, too.",

We were very frustrated on Easter Sunday trying to find somewhere to eat at the last minute.  I stumbled upon this place perusing Yelp and boy were we pleasantly surprised. The wait was only about five minutes for our table outside, Amy was kind enough to get us a perfect table.  Our waitress, Jeanette, was a doll. Very welcoming and genuine.  My mom ordered a BYOBM and the bartender at the counter, Alesia, was so helpful! She made my mom one of the best Blood Mary's she has ever had.  We ordered the Cannoli donuts for the table, pleasant flavor, a little thick but good. I ordered the chicken and waffles and wow, it was delicious. Great portion and the bacon is mixed in the batter. Next time I would get the chicken on the side, I think it made the waffle a bit soggy but still an amazing flavor. My mom ordered the carnitas hash and her boyfriend shrimp hash and they both loved them.  Overall this was an amazing experience. The day started off on a bad note and ended wonderful. Will definitely be back!",

I always enjoy the atmosphere and the chalk walls. This place is perfect for dates or just casual eating with your friends. The prices are fair for Scottsdale, and their service is peak.   If you're into bloody mary's this place nails their bloody bar. I highly recommend giving it a shot.",

The prices was reasonable all staff was very friendly, will definitely come back. Especially for the lump crab benedict and the chicken and waffles. My gf had the croque Madame and was in love with that. No complaints at all, similarly reminds me of Hash House in SD and Vegas, but the prices is lower and the quantity was gods, they didn't tower the whole plate with too much.

The Bloody Mary bar was a fun treat and even without all the olives and bacon, the drink was perfectly seasoned. I had the crab Benedict and my husband had the chilaquiles. Both were flavorful and worth every calorie. The kids devoured their pancakes. The service and hostess were very friendly , so all in all, this was a great dining experience and we would definitely come back here the next time we are in Arizona.",

And then one look around, at the decor, the menu, the \"bakery case\", and we knew we had to plan our escape. Blamed the kid, said something about family issue, and ran. So so happy we tried Hash next.  Whet to begin. Clean. Bright. Modern. Apple Store + brunch spot = their style.  I've seen a Bloody Mary bar before...  But one with fresh raw oysters, pickled mango or bacon infused vodka??  Stop what you are doing--come here now. BTW, came on a Monday morning, but the whole deal was on display just like a weekend. I also ordered corned beef hash and biscuits & gravy.  Hash was excellent, gravy was one of the best, and biscuit was fresh if not just a touch too sweetened for biscuits/gravy delivery system. Probably perfect w butter & honey.  No more reading. You. Here. Now.",

Unacceptable for a Sunday brunch place. The service was slow, and the food mediocre. French Toast was raw inside, scrambled eggs were non-descript. Our coffee wasn't refilled. All in all, not a great experience. Another Hash Kitchen is coming to my neighborhood at 44th St and Indian School. I hope the manager of the new location has their act more together.",

It was good although when I think lox, I think smoke salmon. Here it is just cooked salmon which is smoked because they own the BBQ place next door. Hashbrowns are just diced potatoes in a cup, they were ordinary. The fruit cup instead of the biscuit cost $2. The clincher, which I have read in other reviews is I couldn't get more coffee.

We saw her when she took our order (20 mins after we sat down) when she checked on us  (after 15 mins of waiting I had to ask someone for some extra condiments) and when she brought the check. There was even a party of 6 that was seated 15 minutes after us and left 20 before us. I will definitely go back on a weekend, but NEVER on a weekday  UPDATE: I quickly got a lovely response from management addressing my concerns and inviting me back to either location.

Kaity is one of my favorite , she knows what I get every time and when I walk through the door she already knows what I'm drinking , it's ready at my table and remembers what I get meticulously. I'm a picky eater and I've never had anyone remember my order. She's very easy to talk to and makes you feel at home .This example though is to high light they remember their customers . Your not just some Joe coming in regularly and they won't acknowledge it like most of jag off places in Scottsdale . Go! I will say it again you will be happy with the service and food !",

Our favorites were the fried chicken Benedict, fried chicken hash and the biscuits and gravy.  Our waiter Patrick was very friendly and attentive also!

The cannoli doughnuts looked delicious, but probably should be shared by a lot of people.  I had the corncake \"Benedict\" a great combination of the sweet corn, spicy sauce, meat and eggs.  We also ordered the Sicilian hash.  Sausage mixed in with the potatoes and veggies for the hash, too with Italian sausage links and eggs.  Very tasty.    Portions were good sized, not too large and the service was great.  Coffee and tea served in large mugs was a great touch.",

I was actually really excited for this dish, it sounded kind of unique and tasty. But it was pretty plain actually, I wouldn't order it again. Really the biggest missing piece her was some sort of sauce or cream, even sour cream would've made a difference. It was just super dry, which made it hard to enjoy the dish.   Overall this was a cute space, with a nice deck. I would maybe go back and order something else that explicitly includes sauce!",

But the potatoes were neither crispy nor hash browned. Instead, the potatoes were cubed, and there was too much potato in proportion to the corned beef, resulting in a dry dish.   Our son had the banana split French toast, which he enjoyed. The French toast was tasty, but was delivered with an entire ice cream cone full of butter, which our son found offputting.",

I had the open faced avocado BLT, it was to die for. I'm so glad that I got it. The toast was thick, the pulled pork was plenty and the fried potatoes that were onion gave it a nice touch. My friends got the drink sampler and they looked so cute. Definitely a must If you want to take nice foodie pics. I came on St Patrick's day and I'm not joking when I'm saying it was packed. Many people had the same idea as us that day. We waited for about 1hr 45min to get our table. We wished that they took reservations. There was outside seating as well as indoor seating. It wasn't easy to have a conversation with my friends due to the fact that the DJ was playing some loud music. I'm not sure if that is a normal occurrence but keep this in mind if you want to have a meetup with a new friend you haven't seen in awhile   All in all, I'll definitely come back to try more of their menu (preferably not on a holiday).",

Hey, we're True Arizonians, eating alfresco at 101 degrees with misters is perfectly comfortable. Way more comfortable than the 'scene' indoors.  I guess that's their thing.

They almost tasted like day old donuts?  But, rebounded back with the awesome Bloody Mary Bar. There is so much stuff at the bar, it could be a meal. And the Bloody Mary was great. I ordered the Carnitas Hash. It was huge with good flavors. It had a lot going on and a lot of the flavor were lost in the pile of food. My wife ordered the Breakfast Sandwich. Again, it was huge with good flavors. This is a good restaurant with good flavors and huge portions. A perfect place to take the boys to breakfast.",

To be honest we have stopped going on the weekends because it's so loud you can't hear anything when you are sitting at the table with your friends and family.",

They told us 25 minute wait which seemed reasonable. (It became much more reasonable when I found my way to the build your own badass Bloody Mary bar.) The bartender was super sweet and helpful. She guided us newbies through the drill and gave us tips like getting a celery stalk and using it as a cork board for a gazillion skewers of goodness. This made tasting every single item on the bar a breeze and I didn't need an assistant to carry anything. Who doesn't love gigantic meatballs, olives, pickled asparagus, mango jalapenos, slim jims, clams, cauliflower, onions and green beans in their Bloody Mary??? The shizz was UN.BELIEVABLE!! I'm pretty sure I'll dream about the drinks for the next few weeks, but that's a whole nother story!  Food was off the chain. I got the veggie scramble and it was fabulous. The BF got some coconut banana pancake thing that he inhaled in 2 seconds. My buddy ordered the chilaquiles and loved them.  The final touch that made breakfast so cool was the DJ. He was spinning radical tunes all through the meal. The service was excellent.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out. You can thank me later",

    "text": "This review is for 2.5 stars.  I really wish the service was better.  Coming to Hash Kitchen, it had everything I could ask for in brunch - mimosa varieties, bloody mary bar, tons of dishes, and dog friendly-patios.  Once we arrived on New Year's Day, and the line was about 20 groups deep at 12:30pm, then we knew were in for a morning.    We finally got seated about 30 minutes later.  Outside as we had requested.  So far so good.  Upon seating, it took 20 minutes and 2 separate times of requesting service just to get our water glasses.  10 minutes later a waiter comes out to serve us.  We get our meal in and we're off.  Solid mimosa flight comes out immediately so we can at least get boozing.  Daily selection of 4 fruits, with the blueberry and kiwi standouts.  30 more minutes pass until our food comes.  I ordered a hash skillet with corned beef and side of sausage.  I had requested sweet potato hash, but apparently our waiter said that the chef 'couldn't find' the sweet potato hash so no go.  Undercooked corned beef hash and overcooked sausage let to a below average meal.  The frittata the person I dined with was hefty and loaded with egg, but not much more than a hungry man breakfast.  Although, the biscuits are a must if you do happen to go to Hash Kitchen after this review.  We finally got our check and left after almost 1:45 meal time.  The best part was that everybody in our section was complaining one after another.  In the entire time we were there, we saw 4 different waiters serve a total of 5 tables outside.  One couple left after a few bites as they were so fed up.  Another table complained at least 4 or 5 times before a waiter finally served them.  And then there was a larger couple of about 15 that waited for the entirety of our meal just to be seated, with almost a dozen tables opened, yet unbussed, inside.  All the while the manager is sitting at the podium, definitely not managing this comedy of errors.  A fiasco of a brunch with just average, hit or miss food.  The drinks were good and the atmosphere of Hash Kitchen was so good coming in, but the service was just so mediocre that it leaves a bad taste in your mouth for any chance of dining in the future.",

I had the Herb Fried Chicken Hash which runs around $14 and consists of potato hash / poached eggs / fried leeks / warm maple reduction and a boneless fried chicken breast. I asked that my eggs be scrambled with cheese. It was pretty yummy and honestly I probably could have shared based on the size. My friend let me taste her Corned Beef Hash and I enjoyed it. If you find yourself in the area, it's certainly worth a try. Overall I had a very positive first experience.",

The portions are large so you can share an entree!  The SERVICE was fantastic! Jesus was our server and he did an exceptional job. He exceeding expectations!

I usually don't try crab just anywhere as I'm from Maryland and we have some of the best crab ever but I decided to try it here and I'm happy I did. Anywho, the hash comes with sweet potatoes and two eggs any style and is topped with a hollandaise sauce. I loved it!  Also, go for the mimosa flight.

I have to say that Hash Kitchen has been my go-to place when I don't feel like deciding. The service here is always amazing, not to mention Bonnie always comes to my table asking how everything is and complimenting me! She truly is a sweet person. I always order the Boring Bene which is your typical eggs Benedict and I LOVE it. It is my favorite out of all the places I've tried in this area. The atmosphere here is fun and classy. If you like Bloody Mary's, there is a build your own bloody bar. It has everything you could imagine adding to your drink.   With that being said, if you are picking between two places for brunch, THIS is your spot! You'll be sure to love it.",

    "text": "We've been looking for a great brunch restaurant with a good Bloody Mary for a while now and I definitely think we've found it!  My husband, our 1 year old son, myself and our best friends with their 2 small children all went there around 11 am on Sunday. The wait was long, but it was expected! The AMAZING Bloody Mary bar definitely makes the wait worth it! Our buzzer went off and they must have forgotten we had the kids because the table they offered us was a high top and we needed high chairs but everyone worked so well to accommodate our party and make it work! Bonnie was so great to make sure the kids were all ready and settled and that we were all comfortable in our new table!  The ambiance was amazing and the d.j on Sunday was so much fun!  That same girlfriend and I just went back for lunch today and the experience was just as great, and the Bloody Mary's were just as good! ;)  Both times we have been there the service was great, the food was better, and Bonnie was there with a smile on her face, dressed to the nines, and making our experience so perfect!  We will definitely be back to our new favorite brunch spot!",

The service is fantastic. I'm not much of a bloody mary person but I'll tell you they sure know how to make it appetizing! You literally and take a piece of freshly cooked sausage and put it in your Bloody Mary if that's what you want. Really clean and seems organized. Plenty of parking. It's definitely kind of trendy but welcoming. I can't wait to go back",

Stay away from the blue crab or smoked salmon hashes, both are very fishy and dry.  Was hoping it was lox type salmon but sadly it is not.  Bloody Mary bar is cool idea, but a bit of a process just to be able to get your drink.  Was a long wait at the BMary bar.    Be prepared for LOUD environment, especially after the dj starts.",

We waited nearly 45 minutes at the bar and were told we couldn't sit there unless we were \"dining there.\" Little did she know (I guess she was a manager, she was wearing a suit) we had already ordered drinks and starters from the bartender while we waited. The check took forever to come and then it again took forever for the server to come pick up the checks to cash out. We ended up bringing our checks to the server.   Food was very good. I ordered the Banana and Nutella French toast and a friend ordered the crab and sweet potato hash!   I'd recommend going, but maybe not during prime time on the weekends.",

We passed the time waiting for our table at the bloody mary bar. We had the spicy one and it was tasty and had a bit of a fun kick to it.  For our meal, we had the corned beef hash with the biscuit. The hash was fresh and tasty and the corned beef was in large pieces that were delicious.  Sadly, the bathroom was pretty dirty and although I realize it was busy, they seem to have enough staff around that someone should be checking on it periodically.  All in all, a solid experience. I will try them again on weekday.",

The first time we went, our server didn't smile once and was probably seen three times the whole meal. She wasn't even the one who dropped the check to us.   The second time we had the same person and wasn't much different.  We went this morning and wasn't greeted for 18 minutes. I know that because I texted my mom to tell her I would text her later because I was at brunch. No one greeted us, everyone just kept walking past us. A guest noticed we weren't helped before a server did. After about 15 minutes we were offered drinks by a different server, so we order waters and a Bloody Mary. Finally the actual server noticed that we were his table and apologized for the wait. By this time we were done with our drinks, ready for another one and knew our orders for food. We ordered it all because we weren't sure when we'd see him again.   It took about 15 minutes for our new drinks and food to come. The food was delicious but the second blood Mary's were not, my roommate and I couldn't even finish them. I'm not sure if the original server and our server rang in different ones but we didn't like the second ones at all.  No one came over to check how we were doing, we would have said something if someone asked.   Like I said, I really really want to like this place but I've yet to have a positive service experience. I hope others are having better luck, and we're just gone during poor times. :(",

And the price is just right. The wait is usually twenty to thirty minutes so grab a drink! The food is good not great. The only awkward feeling you get is when it's your turn at the hostess stand. We went two weeks in a row and both times a man and another man and woman are usually arguing or chatting between each other without acknowledging you. You can tell it's most likely the family that owns the restaurant so you want to forgive them but it's just a bizarre feeling. Like you want to say \"get it together!\" The service is mediocre, takes a few minutes to get someone to come over and a few more minutes to get drinks. Like I said, get yourself a Bloody Mary or two and it'll all work it just fine!",

I was sold on pictures of a build your own Bloody Mary Bar, it didn't disappoint. \"Come for the Bloody Mary's but stay for the breakfast\". I had the carnitas hash and would definitely recommend it.  The service was great and I won't soon forget Bonnie the woman that greets you as soon as you walk in. Better than that she is a Buckeye fan! O-H.  When I'm in the area again I will be back.",

Drinks were awesome, food was great and seems to really take an effort to make sure everyone is happy and kids enjoyed themselves.  And they had great music playing as well.",
