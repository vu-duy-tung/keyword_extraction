Service was Ok, but I will never go back---DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME--TACO BELL IS BETTER",

I dont need a cool \"hippster\" vibe to add to my meal....just give me the basics; Delicious, friendly with great service.  Green Chille Burrito-Amazing Rice and Beans-Amazing Tamale, encilaldas, taco's...every item on their menu is a solid decision and you wont be dissapointed.  New to the resturant? Ask the server for suggestions. I have my favorite dishes there but after eating there so often I have literly asked the waitress to suprise me and have never been let down.",

We were greeted with chips and each our own little bowl of spicy good salsa. No more than 3 min later we were greeted by our hostess Crystal and asked what we would like to drink. One minute later as we wet our whistles we ordered our din din. Rand ordered a #14 Chile Relleno & shredded beef taco, and I ordered a # 36 Pescado Relleno (Fish) plate.  No more than 7 min. later I was looking at my meal and it was looking at me. (The fish was served flayed open with head and tail still attached.) ONE WORD:  Yummy! It was tasty as can be, and I was glad, as I normally order a Carne Asada Burrito when I eat Mexican food. I highly recommend this spot and It's a shame Alexander and Nader had such a soggy humid experience here. It seems to have been fixed as this was not the case on my first visit here this evening.   Oh, and I liked the old photos of things like Poncho Villa's Wanted poster and other early 1900's historical Mexican events.",

Service wasn't great either, there were only 3 servers and they were working pretty hard. We waited a long time for our orders and about 2 people had to wait a really long time for their food.  The chips and salsa were eh, ok. I ordered a chicken enchilada and a beef taco, no sides. The food was bland and not too flavorful. Unfortunately, a person in our party found a hair in their taco. After hunting down our server, she quickly took it away, but there was quite a wait for the new plate.  It's cheap, but I wouldn't go back unless I had no choice.",

    "text": "I love me my Juan's!    I debated between 4 and 5 stars.  I decided on 5, and I will tell you why!  FOOD gets the 5 stars- a rating for \"Old School Mexican Food\"; not for Elements or Kai.  In the genre of budget-priced Mexican food, it's a 5 star.  The food is SOOOO good!  It is that old school Sonoran style type of Mexican I remember from when I was a kid in Phoenix (60's-70's).  It is simple, generous servings but not monstrously so.    The staff are long-term, get to know you types.  They work hard, and are very easy going when it comes to just about anything; even when you pay, they'll take your group's bill and allow you to pay one at a time, so no dealing with a split check a the table.  This is good for groups going out for lunch from work.  In the early 90's there original location was on 16th St- TINY... and they were renown for their burros.  They are still a mainstay today and if you aren't certain of what to order, get a burrito.  Their tortas are also exceptional.  I am partial to the basic combo plates.  The drawbacks:  and yes, there are some-    TIME.  I would go more often, but the amount of time you will wait can be very inconsistent.  Even when we arrive early (for lunch), there can be delays.  I shouldn't be gone for more than an hour for lunch, and have been 90 minutes twice when out at Juan's.  For me, this is a problem.  And even though i really like the wait-staff, i think that there are some organizational issues that cause the hold-ups.  Maybe understaffed?  I don't know for sure, but it's worth mentioning.  CHIPS.  I like the chips and hot sauce, but don't LOVE them.  They are the old school variety, which are OK but I do like me some really hot out of the fryer chips served with cold chunky salsa, and that's not what you'll get here.  You will get the smooth red hot sauce and usually tepid thicker chips.   If you  haven't tried Juan's, and you don't have an inflexible schedule, DEFINITELY give them a try.  Order an old favorite, and see if you like how they prepare it.",

I had the number 10 beef enchiladas w red sauce.  The plate comes with rice and refried beans.  They started me off with chips and salsa.  Being a bit of a salsa expert, I think the salsa was a bit watered down and had too much garlic.  However it was about a 2 out of five stars.  The imported bottled beer is only 3.50 a bottle so that was a nice price for a Pacifico beer with lime.    Upon the arrival of my food, the plate was very hot and the food was fresh.  The rice was awesome and had a great flavor, and the refried beans were among the best i've had.  The enchiladas were three stars out of five as the sauce was bland and appeared to be out of a jar.  However they were able to salvage the plate by adding fresh onions on the enchiladas which raised the taste to a 4.  The prices on the menu are very reasonable and overall was a good meal.    Would like to try some of their other menu items to give it a better rating.",

This place is about a 10 minutes drive from my house. Not far but far enough. I should have checked the order when I picked it up but I suppose I didn't expect people to be so incompetent that they couldn't put things into a bag. It's not that hard. I know I sound like a jerk but I'm writing this literally right after I had a conversation with an employee named Pablo there who really irked me.   I told him I was unhappy and that I wanted a refund. He immediately said no refunds. He also tried to accuse me of having the order by saying they don't have any left over food. Then I asked to speak to a manager who could do something. He a said the manager went to lunch. It is 7:00 pm. After continuing the conversation and explaining to this person that they cannot keep my money for a product I never received and no longer want, I asked when the manager would be back. He said he doesn't know and they will probably be back \"like on Monday or something\". I then questioned him about his statement earlier saying the manager is on lunch. He said the manager went out to eat. Then I asked him if they are on lunch until Monday. He said that it was obvious I should know this since they're about to close and that's their store hours. I replied to him that I don't work there so it isn't obvious to me that they would be there on Monday. I have to say that this person came off as a condescending, uneducated, liar. He is not the type is person a proprietor would want answering their phones or being the vocal representation of their company.   Considering there are over 100 Mexican restaurants within 10 miles of this place, you would think they weren't such inflexible jerks. I went to PHX Burrito House instead where I get great food and great service. I will never order from this place again. So much for wanting to try something new.",

Authentic. Delicious. Friendly. But... Don't be in a hurry. They're a busy family owned place, so sit back, relax and enjoy the tasty chips and salsa! I recommend a large drink so you don't need to ask for refills. The tacos are amazing and the green tamales are to die for! Don't think it over. Just go to Juan's!",

I always opt for nacho cheese, because what's the point otherwise? The nachos are good, filling, and reasonably priced.   But what really makes this place amazing is their bean and cheese burrito. Such a simple menu item, but SO delicious, especially with their salsa!! I take the bus into work, and I was tempted to drive in just so I could pick up another couple burritos!

I recommend the green chile burritos, shredded beef tacos, and the chile rellenos.",

Green Chili pork burro totally hit the spot - atmosphere was clean and welcoming.  Chili Relleno was good, not mind blowing, but certainly not the worst.  I'd go back for sure... In fact since its so close, I could see it being a go to spot for the south of the border cravings.  Which reminds me... I'm overdue for a Sonoran dog.",

The food is good, not great, but still good. I'm not convinced that the guacamole isn't made from powder. The beans are runny, the rice is pretty average and the service isn't the fastest or the best. Funny thing is I still go back from time-to-time.   If you want a decent meal at a good price then by all means this will do the trick. If you are going for lunch give yourself plenty of time or call in advance and pick it up.

Reminds me of the Sonoran food typical in Tucson...which in my opinion, has some of the best Mexican food in the country.",

Hidden near the 51 and Thomas Road in a building that looks like a sports or topless bar, Juan's offers excellent Mexican food with great prices and friendly service.

Even when the spacious restaurant is crowded, there is normally not a long wait to be seated and order.

Took one bite of the salsa, that was it.. out of here. The salsa here is from a can.. tasted like tin with some added cumin. The chips were cold, greasy, stale and soggy form the humidity.

My sole criticism is that the portions are a little smaller than I typically expect. I've had so far their carne asada plate and carne asada fries. The portions in each were a little smaller than I am used to. The flavor, however, is on point! Their carne asada is absolutely delicious. The best I've had in the valley so far in the 6 months I've been here. Also, if you are a horchata fan, I am pretty sure they make their own in house and it is excellent. If you want to eat very late at night, or if you want the biggest portions possible, Juan's is probably not what you are looking for. But if you are going for flavor and quality, you will not be disappointed.",

I really wanted to like Juan's so badly, especially after reading so many positive reviews. However, the food in my opinion just isn't good.  This was my second visit to Juan's Authentic Mexican Food Restaurant, and for me the food is just so-so. Just one step above what you would be served in a fast food establishment.  I enjoy starting my meal with chips and salsa just like everyobe else.  The salsa at Juans is like a watery tomato puree posing as salsa and the chips tasted stale. For my entree I choose the Beef Flatas and Mexican rice, both of which had very little taste.  The meal was just very disappointing and took over 30 minutes to serve.  Juan's isn't the worst but I'm not in a rush to visit again",

We got attention as soon as we sat then five minutes after at which time we ordered. The Chips and salsa were very flavorful.  The service was brisk, and the food was served hot. Each plate that I saw was covered with food. The person that ordered tongue got to nice slices. I had  #14. The Chili Relleno was of good size, filled with cheese and smothered in a piquant sauce that had both liquid tomato and chunks. The chicken taco was about six inches long and four inches high. It was filled with chicken, and tasted strongly of that meat and the shell it came in. The rice was firm and the bans were smooth. I cleared the plate. Something I did not intend to do, that's how good it was.   This is a no frills Mexican Restaurant. It's five stars because it does what it is so well. The food is reasonably priced. The service is quick without being rushy. It is clean throughout. I don't know what more you could want from a place like this. I give it FIVE STARS.",

It was fairly busy with the majority of the tables full and a well maintained modest facility. While waiting for our food to arrive I used the restroom which appeared to be newly updated and very clean. The totality of these two impressions would lead one  to be confident of an overall positive experience... how mistaken we were. My fiance ordered the nachos with extra cheese and I ordered the Red Chile burro with rice and beans and a shredded beef taco on the side. The food took a good 15 minutes to arrive. When we received the food it was plated neatly and with care. I didn't care for the red Chile, tasted sweet and almost like they used ketchup or some sort of roasted something that wasn't to my liking, many people probably would like it but I did not. The beans were tasty and the rice was so-so. My boyfriend's nachos were an impressive, large portion , display of a mound of chips with Carne Asada and all the fixin's. The problem was that it came with nacho cheese sauce  -- he hates nacho cheese sauce. Now it wasn't Juan's fault that he doesn't like nacho cheese sauce but it should have been noted that it is nacho cheese sauce . When he asked if they could remake it they said no. Unfortunately after that they became cold and icy with us and not very pleasant. Most restaurants , especially family owned spots want their customers to have an enjoyable dining experience , not Juan. Will not go back . We ended up getting Del Taco ...",

I read other yelpers hating on the salsa here, I'm going against the grain.  The salsa is tasty.  Not only is it amazing as a hot sauce on any of the food, but it is one of the better Chips & Salsa, salsas I've had.  It not super chucky but it is very flavorful, the green onions are great.    The Carne Asada Burrito or the Supreme Nachos have been my go to items.  I really enjoy the flavor of there Asada.  Very flavorful, tender marinated steak.  Not dry or chewy.    I'm finding the prices are cheaper than Fili, Ari, Ali-\"Berto\" spots, and the food is more enjoyable.    Arnold said it best, \"I'll be back\"",

    "text": "So......My boy B Davis wrote a review on this spot and said it was legit.  I have been in Phoenix for over a month now and have not eaten any GOOD Mexican food!  I was craving some tacos so I decided to try this spot out.  I was glad I drove down!  I walked in and was told to sit wherever I wanted.  I grabbed a table and a nice lady came over to take my drink order and deliver some chips and salsa.  I placed my order for 2 beef tacos and a cheese quesadilla with green chiles in it.  I had a large Diet Coke to drink.  Here is how the food was...............  Chips and Salsa-  They bring you out a large basket of chips and a little thing of salsa.  I took a bite of a chip and had a flashback.  They reminded me of something.....I took another bite and then it hit me.  These chips tasted exactly like the chips at El Tarasco in Manhattan Beach.  That is definitely a good thing.  El Tarasco serves up whole fried tortillas.  Juans cuts them into chips but the taste was identical.  I was impressed!  The salsa was tasty too.  It was pretty mild and refreshing.  The chips were so good that I ate 2 baskets full!  Beef Tacos-  I got 2 of these bad boys.  They are a bit small but they were awesome.  These also reminded me of somewhere from back home.......Titos Tacos!  Similar taste, texture and size.  Titos uses more cheese,  but other than that, they were pretty similar (Titos are a bit better but hey...Titos makes the best hard shell beef taco ever...no shame in never being as good as Titos).  The shredded beef was seasoned well, the shells were perfectly crispy. I would have liked a bit more cheese, but it was still enough the way they came out.  It was a fantastic beef taco!  Quesadilla with Chiles-  When I bit into this, it ALSO reminded me of somewhere from CA....... Sombreros!  I would always get a beef taco and quesadilla combo at Sombreros.  This quesadilla was an exact replica!  It had nicely melted cheese, tons of green chiles and it was folded up into a nice flour tortilla.  I dipped this in the salsa and it was a winner!  Diet Coke-  Nice to see they serve Coke products.  Total for my meal was $11.12.  Not too shabby for a grip of food.  I ate 3 different things and each one reminded me of some of my favorite Mexican food places from back in CA.  You simply cannot beat that!  Service was very friendly and it felt like you were eating in someones house kind of.  I can't wait to go back to try out some of their other offerings.  I can see this place becoming our families go to Mexican joint.  It's a bit of a drive from where I live (its way closer to work), but I was very impressed and will be back soon.   Good find B Davis.....good find!",

In order not to be too brutal, the enchiladas were edible. Zero personality with our server and counter cashier. Must hate their jobs. No mas Juan's for us. Our bathroom can attest to that three hours later.",

My dad got a shredded beef chimichanga and a shredded beef taco, and my mom had a carne asada burrito (w/o guacamole) and a small bowl of red menudo. Everybody enjoyed everything.  My tacos came to the table wrapped in foil, and when I opened it... WHOOSH! They were filled with steaming hot meat, onions and cilantro.  The steam just wafts out straight to your nose. Beef tongue is amazing when it's done right, and Juan's does it just right.  That lengua was so tender: it's like butter when it hits your teeth. I put a little salsa and jalapenos for some spice. So good!  Beans and rice were good, you can't mess that up.  The menudo though... that menudo? My mom was murdering it, so my dad ordered a large bowl and shared it.  That broth was so flavorful and had plenty of hominy and tender chunks of tripe.  Why have I never been here before?  Pretty good service too.  I'd love to come back and try the infamous chile relleno or the green corn tamales!",

Their works burrito is the best in town, especially with their homemade green sauce which is creamy and cheesy and gooey and spicy and otherwise indescribable. You can dip your chips in it, put it inside the burrito, outside, or just drink it straight out of a cup (I haven't done this, but given the opportunity...). I've customized my works burrito in a variety of ways. I've had it with shrimp, fish, carnitas, carne asada, pollo asado, chile relleno, machaca, shredded chicken, a combination of several meats at once, with one tortilla instead of two (less carby), and with no tortilla at all (great as a chip dip). I actually drive nearly 20 miles just to eat here. Their salsa is excellent, and their chips always fresh. This is one of those gems that you would never suspect from passing it by on the road. This isn't just another burrito shop, this is the best Mexican food in the valley!",

They have a huge menu serving alot of different dishes.  I have to admit, I usually order a la cart because I cant finish a combo.  Right now I'm stuck on the cheese enchilada, side of beans, and a large flour tortilla and they are huge!  The service is always excellent and I have never had any long delays in getting waited on or getting the food.  There is nothing I know of on the menu that isn't tasty.  But, one the I would like to mention is the things you can take home: such as tortillas2.45 for a dozen that weigh over 3 lbs.,  hot sauce very reasonable, beans at a good price.  Just a thought.  Oh and I can't remember being made to feel as welcome as I do at Juans.   Ciao",

Packed at lunch time but they still have super fast service.",

We were acknowledged right away & offered the smallest table I have ever seen. I requested a booth & was told that she would have to ask if we could sit there? We were finally sat & we quickly received our drinks along with chips and salsa. The salsa was good however the chips were quite stale and cold.  We ordered our meals and then we waited.........and waited.......and waited. Nobody checked-in, no drink refills. Nothing. I finally asked how much longer and was told there was a large table that was causing the wait.  The biggest table in the entire restaurant held an astounding 7 patrons. Needless to say the the wait totaled an entire hour. I ordered the \"super\" nachos, let me tell you they were anything but super. Stale chips, canned nacho cheese, canned beans. Minimal onions and tomatoes. I am being generous saying there was 1/2 cup of meat on the entire plate. My husband had the chili relleno and he said it was quite good.  I have had better nachos at the movie theater. This is no better than Taco Bell and definitely slower. Needless to say, we will not be back!",

Meanwhile Mr. Tattoo just stands behind the counter when he could have easily sat tables when he wasn't cashing people out. When someone finally does walk by, all they say is \"seat yourself\"... So what was the point of standing there the whole time if we could seat ourselves?  We finally get seated only to sit another 5 to 10 minutes before somebody walks their ass over. The food took a good 30 minutes to get out. I ordered two tacos and a burrito. I was hoping that the food would make up for the lack of service, but sadly it did not. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't outstanding either.",

The restaurant has been pretty busy every time we have gone, which is always a good sign. Living in Arizona for over 27 years I have always been a good fan of Mexican food and this place is solid. It's nothing fancy, but that's perfectly fine by me. Go to's for us are the ground beef chimichanga, the flautas, enchiladas, and their tacos. Have never been disappointed by this place, and they are usually very efficient and timely with orders regardless if the order was placed in the restaurant or over the phone. I am allergic to avocado and they are very good about making sure that my food doesn't have any guac or avocados, while still making sure my fiancee gets her avo fix. Were a fan of Juan's!",

That might have put a magic bullet in my plans, but I wasn't going to be discouraged in chasing the truth.  Speaking of the truth, Jaun's is legit.  Let me tell you why.  The service has always been good in my experiences there, and I've been coming to this little neighborhood joint with my family ever since I was old enough to first learn about the Gulf of Tonkin.  So like, seven?  The restaurant has always been family owned and the dad/mom that own it will always recognize you like how I can recognize an obvious government cover up.  Puercos...  The food's consistently good, and cheaply priced.  I tend to get the #17 combo plate with lengua tacos, rice and beans.  Nom.  Trust me - carne asada fans, don't be afraid of eating tongue.  You already eat up enough of it from politicians, might as well branch out to something honestly good.  Smother everything in that salsa of theirs and finish it all off with some sopapillas?  With the honey?  Please.  You'll be so content that you'll go right back to being a mindless drone without a second thought.  Operation Northwoods who??  Exactly.  You shill.  You happy, full, shill.  Don't even get me started on their #6 chimichanga plate.  Throw some red sauce and guac on that thang'.  Hope you don't have to go back to the office.  It'll leave you leaning back, and to the left.  Anyways, the Warren Commission couldn't even keep this place under wraps.  It's clearly a staple in the neighborhood with the amount of regulars lined up out the door on that grassy knoll.  I mean side walk.  Sorry...  ...Oswald didn't act alone.  Great parking.  Don't be afraid to park in the bail bonds lot next to it too.  Anyone going there doesn't own a car.",

I've never been there during lunch hours, usually right before the evening rush and I've never experienced a long wait. I've noticed that it's pretty quiet, I'm usually sitting at the loudest table in the place! The service is decent. I've had better and I've also have had FAR worse!   The food is good. Their combinations are GIANT! And so is their soda! They come in these HUGE cups, and it's hard for me to finish a second! lol, but someone at my table is always willing to help me! Their tortas are to DIE for!! I always order either the Al Pastor or Carne Asada Torta! Their salsa is very good but it can be a struggle to get the waitress to get a second bowl.   The staff behind the counter always seems busy preparing food and getting to-go orders ready. It's sometimes cool to watch them go at it all warp speed! One thing about this place is that you have to go up to the counter to get your ticket when you're ready to pay instead of having the waitress bring you the check. This is a cultural thing, a lot of hardcore authentic mexican places are like this, so just go with it.   Parking in their lot can be a lil tricky, I've hit a few cars trying to park my car here, but I think it's because I'm a bad driver. But still make sure your rear view and side view mirrors are facing the right direction! :P and expect a great meal with no frills or BS pretention, this is the real deal... sure, there's better places to get great Mexican food in the town, but after spending half a day to have an IHS dr. tell me that all I need is tylnol, all I want is a flippin' taco!",

I was pretty underwhelmed with the service, chips, and salsa- all pretty bland. My chimichanga was okay, big and beefy, pretty difficult to mess up. The guacamole was weird though, really thin and pureed, possibly from a mix even. The beans and rice were standard, and everything came in very big portions, including the soft drinks which are roughly the size of a small bucket! I liked my friends green chile plate much better than what I got, which is why Juan's gets a generous third star, otherwise, this place would be a solid 2 stars.   It is really, super cheap and they don't scrimp on the AC (it was about 60 degrees in there!) Some people probably like that, I think it makes my food go cold way too fast. Would I go again? Meh. Maybe. If I was in front of it and felt like big, cheap Mexican food- otherwise there are many other places I would opt for.",

    "text": "Been going to Juan's for over 10 years.  It is family owned, they are great people but don't expect them to be gregarious, they seem somewhat shy.    This place has great family style Mexican food.  The salsa is not out of the can as some have suggested, it is fantastic.  The chips are a weak spot, not always fresh or hot.  I love the chimichanga and carne asada tacos.  You can't this quality and quantity of food for less than $8 anywhere else.  The beans and rice are also great, if not understated.  Another way to rate a restaurant is it's cleanliness.  They always get top ratings by the county health department.  They can get really busy at lunch and Friday nights, guess lots of other people think this place it great.  Another sign that the place is good....lots of cops eat there too!",

Juan's is in a older building and there's nothing fancy about the place, but the food met and exceeded my expectations, in flavor, quantity and price. I had a Chile Rilleno and a Chicken Enchillda with retried beans, and it was all delicious. When I ordered the Relleno my waitress raved about how good they were, and from the first bite I understood her enthusiasm - I wished I had ordered 2 more! The salsa was good enough for me to take home some - I'm kinda tired of the diced-tomato kind, Juan's is more like a sauce, and I'm still enjoying it at home. I'll definitely keep this place in mind.",

The red chili was watery as well. I'm used to red chili having thick sauce. The flavor was a bit dull as well. The rice and beans were cold. Beans had good flavor, rice not so much.  My daughter a side of rice and beans and I'm pretty sure they forgot so I had to walk up to the register and ask for it. The food was priced low which was nice. I personally won't return.",

But from the outside it looked a little older, the parking lot was large enough. Placing an order over the phone was fairly easy, food was ready in about 20. I ordered a combo which included 2 gorditas, rice and beans. I got carne asada on my gorditas. The rice and beans were pretty basic but good enough. The gorditas on the other hand were kinda dry and lacking any real flavor. Not a fan. I also ordered a crunchy taco which normally is not my favorite but they fry their own tortillas and it was pretty good. My boyfriend ordered a chimichanga with carne asada. The chimichanga was actually pretty good, nice and crispy and the carne asada tasted better here. The large drink is as big as my head so warning on that. Overall, not sure I'd go out of my way to eat here again but if I was in the neighborhood might try something different on the menu.",

I called and informed the employee and after speaking to the owner she confirmed that I had to return the order to the restaurant in order to get a refund. What an inconvenience. I live 15 minutes away. But I decided to go in order to speak to the owner in person. After speaking to the owner, she heistated wanting to give me the refund. I explained how it was a complete inconvenience and I will not be returning. She disputed that the tortilla was stale and said she was only going to refund me for this one time and that was it. Oh no. I was done by that point. To sum it all up - no one even apologize for the terrible experience.",

One time I was really impressed by Juan's is when my wife and I were getting out of a function and needed to grab a quick dinner to take home.   It was 10 minutes before closing, so we called expecting no answer.   Not only did someone answer but the person on the phone assured us that they will stay open for us to pick up our order, and to take our time getting there.    Overall great family restaurant that always provides a nice hot plate of Mexican food.",

The food served at Juan's is delicious and cheap. Their nachos with guac and machaca are the best I have ever had. The service is quick and I always feel at home there. I try to go once a week, and I never walked out disappointed.  For me, that's great atmosphere. They sure sodas in huge glasses, as is their generous portions. Their green corn tamales are the best, as is their green enchilada sauce. Also a favorite are their cheese crisps, machaca enchilada and ground beef tacos. Try their sopapillas for desert.",

We waited too long to get a table, too long to get our order taken, and way too long for boxes for our food. The staff was friendly, just incredibly slow. Granted, the restaurant was full.

The service left something to be desired, primarily because we had to wait over thirty minutes for our food to arrive, even though the restaurant was not packed until after we received our food. Additionally, I was not impressed by the tamale on my plate and found the cheese enchilada cold. My husband was also less than impressed by his chile relleno, but found it more edible than my food. Overall, we have had much better Mexican food at numerous other establishments in the Phoenix area and will not be returning.",

I don't think there is one thing on the menu I haven't had.  But to give you suggestions: * Chile Relleno - won't go to anywhere else * Green Corn Tamales - didn't like them until Juan's * Machaca (either Burritos or Plate) * Refried Beans - plain & simple but the best around. * Beef Tacos, hey I love them - can't explain it just do. * Burritos always at least 2 meals for me. I love that they expanded and made it with more booths. Love Arriba's, Sylvia's La Canasta, Mi Patio, La Tolteca and many others...But, Juan's will hold a special place in my heart & stomach...",

Juan's is an unassuming box building with a green awning and sign that reads \"Juan's Authentic Mexican Food.\" After entering, the first thing I noticed was that there were a lot of Hispanic people enjoying their lunch, which is always a good sign. The establishment is clean and simple. You have the option to take out or dine in with waitress service. Dine in we did and we were greeted by the peppiest waitress I've come across in a long time.  I ordered a carne asada burrito, enchilada style and with sour cream and guacamole on the side. It was excellent, and ridiculously filling. In fact, sad enough as it is, I couldn't even put it all down. And to wash all that down I had a nice sized horchata. My Dad had a quesadilla and was equally satisfied. Mmm, I'll be back Juan.

Oh, but wait... they don't teach Home EC anymore! So grading this meal (dinner) would be difficult. At least the waitress had a cool air about her that said I don't eat much of anything here, so you can't hold my opinion up to any of this feed. That's right feed not food.  Furthermore the decor and vibe in the place is lacking. Sitting there reminded me of a pass life experience of eating and waiting at a bus terminal.",

I agree with a previous rater, Juan's food is so-so and acceptable.  Generally speaking, the service might be called good service (\"...except for the owner who is...\").  Be prepared to wait and no matter what, the wait to get your food is always slow no matter how empty or packed--ESPECIALLY if you order take out and ask how long before pick up will be ready. On a recent occasion, I placed a take out order and asked the owner on the phone how long it would take and he told me 20 min.  I waited 15 min before leaving the house and it took 5 min to get there. When I arrived and asked for my order, I was courteously advised by the cashier that it was \"not yet finished.\" I watched the kitchen staff as they initiated preparing my order from the beginning. As I observed this process I asked the clerk why she said my order was already in process and she responded that \"...it was.\"  When I had first inquired about my order (having been told it was 'nearly ready') I asked whether chips had been included and the owner advised me that I would have had to have ordered chip and paid for them.  While I waited AT the restaurant for my order for 20 min (that is in addition to the 20 min I waited before leaving my home) I would have thought management would have been courteous enough to offer me chips while I waited. They did not. So, instead of apologizing for the inconvenience of waiting on them or making my wait pleasant, I left a very dissatisfied customer.  When I got home with my order, I had to endure my companion's complaints that the Albondigas was skimpy on the meatballs. Same said companion used to frequent Juan's extensively several years ago when he worked closer. He now challenges me each time I indicate intent to go there and refreshes my memory on past disappointments.  The burritos are indeed well made and are pretty much the highlight of the menu. The tosdadas shell are not freshly fried (you can see them sitting on a shelf above the grill), yet, my tostada was still soft. The prices are cheap $7-8 combos. Again, fair if you are in the area but you can find better Mexican elsewhere, even nearby..",

    "text": "Another mixed bag when it comes to Mexican food. Juan's was pretty good; in fact, I really liked pico de gallo a lot as well as the pork and green chile burrito. But, I am a stickler for chips and salsa. Most places always serve fresh chips and refreshing salsa, but Juan's chips were stale. Also, the salsa tasted like tomato juice mixed with diced veggies; it almost had me saying, \"NEW YORK CITY?!\" (hopefully that joke isn't too outdated). On top of that, the tacos I got were also a bit stale. Again though, the pork and green chile burrito (served enchilada style) and the pico were wonderful! Ahh! Such a mixed experience!  I know I'll be back to Juan's eventually, but now I know what I'll probably stay away from on the menu (it is possible it was a fluke, but we'll see). The service was pretty speedy and pleasant so I can recommend it for a quick/cheap bite, but choose your food wisely.",

    "text": "I've been a fan of this place for a few years now. Its to the point when someone from work brings it for lunch, I can tell just from the salsa smell they went to Juans. LoL. The chips and salsa are always a listed item when we order to go from here, for about $1.30, you get a small (which isn't small) bag of chips and salsa. Always ask for extra salsa.  The shredded beef or chicken hard tacos are always fantastic, the fluatas (rolled tacos) are good here as well. You can get them in a combo with rice and beans at a very reasonable price $7.00-$8.00.  When you're sick? Go for the albondigas soup (meatball rice soup). It is soooo good and soothing to aching throats and it just makes me feel better when I'm under the weather. The broth is light but flavorful, with rice on the side, you can add or leave. It comes with flour or corn tortilla.  The have red and green chili corn tamales. Both are fantastic but I go for the green chili corn, extra sauce $2.00.  The service is always nice and professional when we stay in. They're quick to ask if we want a refil on soda, chips, salsa - check back a couple times to make sure you have everything you could want. Sometimes we'll call our order in and decide to sit and eat instead of coming right back to work. Their so easy about letting us do so. When dining in, I get my order quickly. If we're calling in for lunch, we call about 1035AM, since our lunch is at 11AM and before their rush hour begins. So in all, there hasn't been a problem with getting out food.  When you first walk in for lunch, the sitting area looks small. But when it gets busy, they open the back area which has quite a few more booths back there. They have a flat screen going in the corner and also \"bar\" seating. The only thing that bothered me about this place is the Specials board is always under the t.v. at the far end of the dining area. You'll see it if you happen to go to the bathroom or know to look over there.  Oh yea, a large drink is extra large and medium is large. Sometimes I forget and have this delicious but HUGE Horchata, because I said large. This includes both the to go and dine in cup.",

Diverse lunchtime crowd including artists, firemen, and hospital staff and everyone seemed like they were regulars.  Juan's is a gem.  We'll definitely be back whenever we have my nephew at Children's (which sadly, is all too often).",

We know the family that runs the place and everyone gives great service except for the owner who is unfriendly. Lunch hour is always packed, be prepared to wait and no matter what, the wait to get your food is always slow no matter how empty or packed.   On our recent visit, our chips were cold and stale, you could taste the lard and the salsa is a runny type most likely from a bottle. At least that's what is tastes like. Nothing about the beans and rice stands out. The burritos are well made and are pretty much the highlight of the menu. The prices are cheap $7-8 combos. Good if you are in the area but given the choice of having to take a drive, you can find better Mexican elsewhere.",

Better yet, if you can't find what you want on the combo menu, you're just too damn picky. I have never been to another Mexican restaurant with so many combo plate options--whatever you want, you'll eventually find it on the list.

Their cheese enchiladas are perfect, they even ask you if you want onions or not! Most restaurants don't ask and you find big chunks of white onions in every bite, ruining it (if you don't care for onions, like me) and forcing you to pick them all out. Ugh. Funny thing though, we usually go on Wednesdays but recently , it was late Saturday and I was bragging about the food to my grandson so we stopped in for dinner. Wow, what a difference from early mid-week dinner to late end-week. I had never ordered the cheese crisp, but did and when it came to our table, I thought it had yellow and white cheese at first glance but no! It had so little cheese that the tortilla was showing through!!! It was awful. The bean and cheese burrito that my grandson ordered hardly had any (if any) cheese in it. He gave the thumbs down on the whole experience. I was bummed because I had talked it up so much! I'll go again, but not at the end of their work week and never later in the evening. That said. Love their food, service and salsa. Try it. Family owned and operated I believe. Enjoy!!!",

The prices are great, and the food is both incredibly tasty and remarkably consistent from visit-to-visit.  I honestly don't know why, but it's also the only Mexcan restaurant where I always leave feeling full in a good way - I've never felt the typical pains associated with overeating after leaving, even when I've certainly gotten too full.   I recommend the Enchiladas, beef tacos and tamale in their #12, or the steak gorditas in #13.  They're slammed during lunch on weekdays so get there by 11AM or after 1PM.",

I got the carne asada burro which was $4.79 and worth every penny. Beware of food belly: it's all meat! (Well there's onion, cilantro, and guac in there too, but it's mostly meat) The tortillas aren't quite as good as Carolina's, but they are a little denser/stretchier which is good when you're not up for messing around with a messy burrito. The meat was flavorful, and lean! I hate when there's a bunch of fatty goobery pieces in the carne, and Juan's didn't disappoint. I only ate a little over half of the burrito because it was so big...and I needed room for chips and salsa.  Now the do or die: chips and salsa. I fancy myself a salsa connoisseur, and this was 8/10 only because I prefer a chunkier salsa. The flavor was really great though: smoky and spicy and obviously fresh. The chips are house made and perfect--firm but not hard, and crispy delicious. Hence my conversion to Nachos next week.   Normally, I reserve nachos for sports bars and happy hours, but next Juansday I am totally ordering the machaca nachos. My work husband got them and they look/sound delicious.  Give it a try. You know you ... JUAN to. *dies laughing*",

This place gets super packed around lunch time but I can see why. Again, excellent and authentic (I'm from San Diego and know my Mexican food). They are also priced well. My husband is a big guy and we both leave full for about $20 average.",

The food was good but it was not super amazing authentic style Mexican. The flavor was very blah. I was disappointed and to be honest the service was not great. Our waitress was friendly but the cashier was obviously wishing she could be anywhere but there. She didn't even try to fake a friendly smile.",
