My salad arrived with a variety of greens that were not listed on the menu and my server apologizing for the substitution. You might have asked me if I wanted kale... I did not. That's why I didn't order the kale salad. The lettuce was brown on the edges and the $1.50 I paid for a sliver of avocado was ridiculous. I can't decide if I'll try you again or not.  I appreciate your nod to health, but meh...",

    "text": "Some friends of ours were looking to have pizza at a place that offered a gluten-free option.  A quick search on Yelp revealed Picazzo's and we were off and running.  I'll get to the brass tax on this one.  The pizza was very good and fresh--no complaints about taste.  The restaurant was cool and had a nice ambiance.  The place was so loud, however, that I had a hard time hearing people talk at my own table.  Service was moderately attentive, but there were times when we were waiting much too long for drink refills--the place was busy, mind you, but the pauses were noticeable.  It comes down to this--do you want to pay $25 for a 14\" pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms?  I usually don't.  I can go to Pizza Slices in Mesa (formerly 99 Cent Pizza Place), and trade in the hipster ambiance for two yummy 18\" pies for $20.  The gluten-free pizzas were apparently quite good, and some of our other guests liked the pasta plates they got.  In this case, if you want the dining experience, options, and atmosphere, Picazzo's will give it to you--you're just going to have to pay a bit more.  Three and a half stars on this one.  Yes, I'd go back, but it would have to be for a special occasion with friends and/or family.  If I've got a pizza jones, this is not the place where I would satisfy it--I want more bang for my buck if I'm looking to chow down on a pie.",

They have great pizza with three choices of crusts-super healthy, gluten free, and regular. They have a full bar with great wine, craft beer and a cocktail menu. The restaurant is divided into a dining area, a bar/lounge, and a patio. There was also a juice bar which I did not try.  My bf and I started with the melted Brie. I'll warn you, it's very garlicky! I personally loved the fresh baked garlic submerged in my cheese but some might not.  My boyfriend had the Deldiablo pizza. This has a good kick and wasn't too spicy. I had a half pancetta gorgonzola and half fig arugula. The pancetta was ok but the fig pizza tasted like dessert! Highly recommend for the pizza lover with a sweet tooth!   The only improvement I can recommend for this place is the service. It was a tad slow but our server was sweet and accommodating.",

I have a daughter who is gluten-free so I am always willing to try any place that serves gluten free, as I can sympathize with how difficult it is to find decent food to accomodate this food allergy.   This however, was not decent, it was downright gross.  First let me say that it is VERY expensive.  I had a lunch special:  1 slice of pizza, a caesar salad, and water - $9.50.  She had a pasta lunch special:  gluten free pasta and a side salad:  $13.50.  Holy cow.  The pizza slice was not gluten free and it tasted awful anyway.  It's really hard to screw up regular pizza crust [because it has literally like 4 ingredients], but the crust had an odd flavor to it.  The pizza was covered in greasy cheese, and the sauce tasted like it was loaded with sugar.  The salad was equally disappointing:  the lettuce had brown edges [aka OLD] and was drenched in nothing that resembled a classic caesar dressing.    The service was ok to average.  It took the waitress at least 15 minutes to process my credit card.... This is honestly probably one of the worst restaurants I have been to in a while.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I discovered this little gem while on the way home from the Grand Canyon. While coming through our usual route through Sedona we were looking for a nice place that served organic food. We ONLY eat Non-GMO Organic food. The evening was saved when we found Picazzo's on 89A!!! (Please tell me it really IS all organic non-gmo?!!)   As a side note: I don't think the chicken is organic so we won't be eating any. If it's not organic, the chickens could be fed GMO corn.  We love to come for happy hour now that we've discovered it...half price appetizers! Of course it would be nice to have a few more 'special prices' besides simply appetizers (& $1off a glass of wine) but it's ok for now. My boyfriend and I get a single slice of pizza ($5.50 average) and 2 appetizers to share. Try the Caprese and the Baked Brie & Roasted Garlic with flat bread, OH YUM This keeps us happy and the bill under $30!  We've been here for dinner and have ordered the spinach salad, very good, and the Margherita Pizza YUM YUM. We have also tried the berry salad which was ok, we like the spinach better. The Puttanesca I found quite tasty, never had it before here.  I'm looking forward to trying some pasta sometime as it looks yummy and the asian salad, as well as the berry bowl and curried broccoli...making me hungry!!  Yes, the food is pricy, but grandma always said ya get what ya pay for! It's not cheap to buy organic food and make it at home either. We love Picazzo's so much that we have begun having our executive business meetings here...and the reviews from our crew have been great! We love to turn people on to organic non-gmo food. Not only is it healthy, it tastes better too!!  The staff has always been great at all locations we've been to (Sedona, Paradise Valley, Tempe) and we look forward to visiting the other locations at some point in Flagstaff and Scottsdale.  The rewards program is a nice addition as well. I'd LOVE to see a location built in Tacoma WA so my daughter could enjoy the fun and I'd have a place to eat out when I visit...ahhh a girl can dream!.  Overall we love Picazzo's and if things continue as they have, we will certainly remain a loyal customer!!",

The meals took an average time to prepare, but even the appearance was unappetizing. Only recently have it started eating gluten free because my gf has a food allergy, but even at this stage, I know better than to think gluten free food has to taste bad. The Eggplant Parmesan was bad. There was an excess of sauce. The eggplant was raw and stale tasting. It was served with burnt bread. The dish was small, and the price was high.   Finally, after trudging through this debacle of a restaurant experience, the server brought our bill and informed us that we wouldn't be able to order dessert because the kitchen was already closed. How do you explain closing the kitchen in a restaurant before the guests leave or before 9?   Oh, I forgot to mention the atmosphere was decent.   All in all, two badly prepared meals, a decent mojito and mediocre service ended up running almost forty dollars. I recommend wary eaters steer clear of this unpleasant experience.",

For example, I got the lunch special with a Zo's Chopped Side Salad and Chicken Picatta Bigoli. The salad was good, but honestly it was about the size of a Wendy's $1 side salad. The pasta reminded me of a Pasta Roni side dish, not very flavorful. It was about two-thirds the size of a side salad.  The service was OK.

We were seated immediately by Elliott.   We were able to order drinks and appetizers. We had the Caprese, baked BBQ wings, Siracha slaw, and cheese bread (free on Yelp! check in) hit the table with a minimum wait. All were very good, though general feeling was that the slaw was a bit milky and bland, and the wings were a tad too sweet. Still good, though.    For the meal, we went with a Vortex pizza, a ravioli, and a Mac & Cheese. Excellent stuff! And Elliott was cordial while he checked on us regularly. Never did our drinks go empty, nor were we ever left waiting. And he was super nice to our little girls.   We'll be back!",

On the instances in which I've done phone orders, the time estimates have been accurate. I appreciate that they listen to their customers and respond to feedback.

First, I have to say that the food is very good and having healthy and gluten-free options straight off the menu is fantastic! However, every single time I order food to go they mess up at least one aspect of my order! Seriously, every single time. That's the reason for only a three star rating.   I ordered two salads. One with dressing on the side and the other just regular, no changes no modifications. I did get the dressing on the side, but the other salad had zero dressing and none on the side even. I took the food back to my office for lunch which was about 20 minutes away so it wouldn't make sense to turn around and go back for the dressing. I ended up eating a dry spinach salad. Sure, everyone makes mistakes sometimes, no worries. But the consistent errors on to go orders really detract from my enjoyment of this particular location.",

I've been to this location many times, even when it was temporarily owned by an independent.  We decided to come here since my boyfriend has never tried this place. They have a great daily happy hour 3-6, half off starters.  We ordered several items in hopes to enjoy some great dishes. Unfortunately, what we ordered had a serious lack of flavor. The turkey meatballs, which I've had before and were good, were missing something.......flavor! The roasted veggies were boring. The hummus was typical. And the baked chicken wings with Tao peanut sauce was 'ehhh'. The overall missing element was FLAVOR!!!  If I were paying full price for these items, I would have been really upset. As it was, I felt we overpaid.  Will I return? Provably not. Too bad. This place as once very good.",

Any way it was advertised as Italian sausage, roasted peppers, gluten-free pasta and red sauce. The sausage tasted like clumps of sawdust; though the sauce was OK. I was told it was, \"turkey sausage.\" Yeah, I don't remember seeing that clarified on the menu. Anyway - if you like Italian meat sausage seasoned traditionally DON'T order here.  The ambiance was nice and the server was friendly. I would have ordered desert but they were short staffed and I couldn't wait any longer. (Had to get back to the hospital before visiting hours ended).  I would return and try another dish.",

As celiacs, my daughter and I have gone to so many places and had their GF dishes. Some good, some not so much. This one is REALLY awesome. We both had the Creamy Tomato Bolognese. The noodles tasted \"real\" -- but actually way better than any wheat noodle I've ever had.   The price was a little expensive, $17.50 a meal (not sure I agree with yelp's $$ rating). The only down side was that our portions were very small. Perhaps that's why I say that it was expensive. I see that other people think opposite. (?) Perhaps we came on a bad day? We are both around 120 lbs., and this was the first time we both said to each other that we were actually still hungry after dining. lol  Otherwise, I would give this place 6 stars.",

Everyone was so friendly, from the moment you walk in the door you can tell these guys have a passion for what they do. They sell gluten free bread you can take home a loaf for $6.50 its fresh, huge portion, and way better than store bought gluten free bread that costs $5 anyway. We definitely will be back, this is for sure our new favorite restaurant because we can finally all go out and enjoy a meal as a family!!! A+",

I've been a Celiac since I was a kid and being able to walk into a restaurant, an Italian restaurant at that, and know that ANYTHING I order is safe was an indescribable feeling. On top of it, I'm newly vegan and this menu is extremely accommodating for vegans. No upcharges either -  I had the vegan buffalo chikin strips - crispy, meaty abs perfect to satisfy my wings craving. We had two vegan sauce options as well.  I also had the vegan Alfredo with spinach and vegan chikin - delicious!!!! Creamy and cheesy. Good portion. GF pasta texture was spot on. My boyfriend got the spicy peanut dish with zoodles - also at no upcharge.  Rounded it all off with a vegan cheesecake!  Let us not forget the OUTSTANDING wait staff as well - they are super knowledgeable and are very patient with questions. They knew exactly what dishes were vegan and how to help us navigate. Really great customer service!!   Go here as soon as you can - you won't regret it!!",

Atmosphere is cozy, yet elegant. Sometimes the service is great, sometimes just good, depends on the day :).   I love the garlic and brie appetizer. Salads are always fresh and full of flavor, (Southwestern is a favorite for me and my mama). The pizza is great. Not the best I've had (BJs still wins that contest), but absolutely wonderful non the less! The chocolate chip pizza cookie is insanely good, but definitely one of those things that make you feel guilty for eating.  This restaurant definitely has the most options for GF eaters than any other I've been to, and takes into account cross-contamination, which is HUGE. I would love to give this place 4.5 stars, because it really is awesome, just not my number one :). Hmmm, now I want pizza.",

A year ago we moved to Tucson from Pennsylvania and I couldn't wait to eat at my favorite restaurant.  Unfortunately there is not one near me in Tucson, so I make every excuse to travel up to Tempe to my favorite Picazzo's.  Melanie has served me twice there and there is not a better server!  She is always available to assist and supply our every tasty desire.  I also want to give a shout out to Beth the manager, because she thought that we were waiting for something and she was right there to check on us.  A diner couldn't find a more helpful friendly staff.  If you want GREAT Italian food at a fair price, with great service, GMO Free, and Gluten Free, this should be your FIRST choice.",

I have some irritating food allergies (gluten, egg and milk free) - and find it very difficult to simply order a lunch without asking the waitstaff to leave off everything. It's not the case at Picazzo's and I commend them for it.  My review is exclusively for the innovative, enormous and filling salads I eat at Picazzos.  The salads have a good mix of dark green leafy and romaine, and are loaded with veggies. Typically when I order my big salad at other places, after they remove the cheese, croutons etc, I am left with a giant pile of romaine, 3 cucumbers, 2 cherry tomatoes and a  cold piece of cut up chicken.  I don't use muchsalad dressing, so just imagine how tasteless this is...  The salads here have enough extra veggies to make every bite interesting.",

However once seated, the lady was more than happy to bring me three saucers of tasters for the soups! Such hospitality, I was enamored. I had ginger beer and their signature gin. Great choice of soups, buffalo wings and pizza. The food is by far the best a chain can offer. Each individual restaurant might have it's hang ups as far as service but my experience was great. I know my in-laws enjoyed their carbonara. I loved my lentil soup. The gin straight up and dirty was excellent. I'm happy to take home their margarita pizza the best in the business with shredded basil instead of full leaf I believe adds far more flavour. Great bathrooms and layout to boot.

    "text": "Great Gluten-Free Pizza and Dessert Menu!  Picazzo's is the only True pizza resturant I've found in the valley (and Sedona and Flagstaff for that matter) that has a full Gluten-Free menu including drinks and desserts. It's nice to be able to go out to dinner with friends and have a whole gf menu ready for me so I don't have to feel like the weird kid out.   It's a bit expensive for the gf pizza...somthing like $18 when I get all the goodies on top, but to me it's worth it and the pizza itself is fabulous. I usually get the veggie pizza and then toss some pepperoni or sausage on it to spice it up a bit. The medium is a good size for 2 people and will leave 1 person enough to take leftovers home.",

I went for lunch today and the menu really is quite impressive. Quinoa pasta galore, gluten free crust, baked (free range, humane, non-hormone treated) chicken wings, nitrate free organic bacon, and more!!   I had no idea what to even order and definitely plan on going back. The chicken wings were \"ok\" but honestly get an A for effort considered they were made without being fried tons of awful polyunsaturated fats (vegetable oil) The greek salad was very fresh and tasty and the girlfriend I was with really enjoyed her pizza. I brought a pizza home for my husband with gluten free crust and it definitely did not disappoint.   It was fairly busy for lunch but our appetizers and entree did take quite awhile to come out to the table (hence the 4 stars)  I really do not like pizza at all so I am not much of a critic when it comes to the perfect slice but am very much looking forward to going back to sample more salads and pastas!",

The non-dairy cheese is very good, they also have many gluten free options (pasta and pizza) I have tasted the gluten free crust before, and I have to say, I think I liked it better than the whole grain crust!   It's nice you can custom order your pizza, just be aware that it will probably come out even more expensive than if you order from the regular menu. If you decide to get a whole grain crust, or if you need to order gluten free, it's also going to cost you more because they will not make small sizes with those crusts. It has to be medium. I ordered a whole grain vegetarian pizza with dairy-free cheese....it came out to be like 25 bucks...yikes! BUT, you do get what you pay for.....quality ingredients, and hey, they know how to make pizza!   Service is great! Very friendly and helpful staff. And they have happy hour 3-6. I wish I could do regular cheese, because I would for sure come in for their one slice with a salad lunch option......oh well, at least Picazzos gives me a pretty good version of what I used to enjoy! Thanks Picazzos!",

The wine list is pretty good, but if you are a BIG Italian red fan you will have to settle for their milder organic wines.  The crust on the pizzas are delicious and don't forget to try the cookie/ice cream desserts.  If you love salads- their Greek one is terrific.  If you need wheat free or other special food needs, this is a great place to go.  This place may not be appropriate for people who want salty, run of the mill cheap food.

Except for their ravioli and baked pasta dishes, all of their pastas are quinoa gluten-free, but you can choose to have rice gluten-free instead. It is SO nice to see a restaurant that offers variety.  Their breads and croutons are ALSO GF! (We almost didn't believe them when they said that the bread that came with our pasta was GF! It was delicious!)  For pizzas they offer a medium size as gluten-free. We chose to try their pasta tonight but will return to try their GF pizza next time. Apparently they have a soy-free, dairy-free mozzarella cheese as well. THANK YOU! Again, we'll come back to try that.  They were crazy busy on a Friday night, as expected, but it was totally worth it. The chocolate chip skillet cookie with coconut vanilla ice cream was superb! I believe all of their desserts are GF also.  If I can make a suggestion to the restaurant, I would love to see their GF pizza crusts in different sizes, and I would also love to see a \"choose your own\" pasta option as well.",

Looks just like your standard Italian eatery.  This place prides itself on  it's organic and local ingredients. Which is great, but the price definitely reflects this.   According to our server, both the regular crust and marinara sauce are 100% dairy free, so I did a create-your-own pizzza with veggies and non-dairy cheese (I believe they use Daiya).  The pizza was good, but not amazing. I like a lot of Daiya on my pizza, so when I go again I'll definitely ask for extra. Also, I ordered spinach on my pizza and I felt that the spinach wasn't fully cooked, just a little wilted. I like my spinach fully cooked because I feel that adds more flavor, but that's a personal preference.  Our drinks took a while to come out, and for what we ended up paying we didn't get a heck of a lot. I'll definitely be coming back soon and see if I can't get them to veganize one of their specialty pizzas.",

Salad came out with only cucumbers and tomatoes on it, no olives, and no peppercinis . Clearly the runners don't check their food to make sure it's right before going to the table. I had to call the server over to bring it to his attention which took forever because he was to busy doing his side work rolling sliverware. My sister ordered the Thai lasagna one for her and one to go for her boyfriend. Then server came back to tell her that they didn't have the ingredients because it's new on the menu so she had the regular lasagna. She said it was good but the server failed to make the order Togo so her boyfriend didn't get his meal due to the kitchen being closed. He stated he didn't hear that but brought the Togo lemonade *side eye* so you heard the Togo lemonade the same time we ordered the togo lasagna...? OH OK. Nevertheless the food is good as long as you go within reasonable hours. Their hours state they close a 9 on Sunday, according to me they left at 8. But the server did say that he'd remember next time. Glad he knows there will be a next time. #HappyMondayYelpers",

You can imagine the first thoughts going through my head finding out that my two favorite foods I LOVE would be off limits.  Ugh............the travesty!  Oh, the injustice!  Then I began searching for places which carried GF pizza crust.  I knew it was out there.  It didn't sound very appetizing, but it's all I can have, so I searched for all the reviews.  I read and researched every one I could find.  I was pretty sure that out of all of the competition one stood head and shoulders above the rest.  Was I right?  Well, I won't know for a while due to the fact that it's the first GF Pizza I've tried.  I seriously doubt that any other GF Pizza will ever top it though.  Oh, yeah it is THAT GOOD!  Quite honestly, it's one of the better Pizza's I've ever had!  GF or NOT.  Where is this place?  Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen: Tempe, AZ.  They have six Arizona locations but this one was inviting, clean (bathrooms spotless), service spectacular and food was delectable.  This place understands GF issues and you feel perfectly fine ordering from them.  They have separate ovens and preparation areas for all GF foods, and so many eating options for the entire family, GF or not.  We started with the GF Organic Garlic Cheese Bread.  Such a great start!  It is served with Olive Oil with a few very tasty olives in it.  It could have been a little more \"garlicky\" for me but it was still extremely good.  Light and airy with a terrific amount of Cheese on it.  It didn't last long on anyone's plate.  I had the Diavalo Specialty Gourmet Pizza.  The GF comes only in Medium size.  The crust is quit thin but very tasty.  It consists of an Organic tomato sauce, with mozzarella, pepperoni, red and yellow bell peppers, caramelized onions, andouille sausage and red pepper flakes (I did LESS Diavolo and omitted the red pepper flakes!)  The sausage still had a little kick to it but not overpowering.  Divine; pure and simple.  The Hubs had the Pepperoni, Sausage and Ricotta on Picazzo's Original Crust (not GF) and was extremely happy with his choice.  The Mother in Law ordered a Half order Natural Chopped Italian Salad Which had so much meat in it she was shocked!  Pepperoni, smoked ham, and salami.  It also lettuce,  garbanzo beans, organic tomatoes, a significant amount of fresh mozarella, black olives, pepperoncini, Parmesan, GF croutons and Italian Dressing.  Completely GF, huge for a half order and looked amazingly fresh! The child was quite happy with a small cheese pizza!  We then finished the meal with a few desserts.  Yes, GF too! I brought most of mine home.  A skillet Brownie.  It's about 6 inches around with non dairy organic ice cream and organic chocolate sauce!  Joy and Bliss rolled into one!   This will be a \"Go To\" place for sure.  Probably only for The Hubs and me, due to the pricing, but what a date night!  I can have Pizza!  It's a little \"Pizza Heaven on Earth!\"",

The slice of pizza I got with it was not quite as fresh, but we also had the baked Brie app which was delicious. They had half-price apps and drinks while we were there (late lunch - 3pm) so I also ordered the Cucumber Basil Breeze cocktail which was amazing! You have never had anything else lik it. Check out the photo I uploaded.  Lindsay was our server and she was lots of fun. Great experience...we will be back!",

The service is great, the bartender seems to have been there for a while and let me know about a rewards program with my telephone number which was great.  Yes, the prices are high but I can understand for what they offer.  Portions are pretty large, usually have leftovers for lunch/later.  My kids enjoy it for both takeout and dining in.

I figured my husband might have not submitted the order, but he swears he did. It really didn't bother me too much, because I understand that there can be technical hiccups every once and a while. So I ordered our food and waited patiently for it to be ready.  I got home and I wasn't particularly happy with what it looked like. I ordered the Biana Pasta, the Berry Salad, and an order of wings.  I have to say  that my husband's salad looked pretty good, but I just wasn't in the mood for salad.  My pasta wasn't very good. I could have made a better dish from store bought pasta and sauce.  We ordered the maple wings and they had a weird taste and the chicken was quite rubbery.    Our meal came to about $40, and I'm glad that we had a $20 off coupon. Had I been dining in the restaurant I would've asked for my money back.  I will not be dining here again and I will not tell anyone to go here based on the bland pasta and wings.",

    "text": "Being 100% Italiano and all I just had to try out this establishment because it can be quite challenging to make high quality Italian food in an organic/healthy manner ...  The menu is quite extensive ... They offer a lot of different things, so there are plenty of options for just about anyone ...  Each time I've eaten here I've done more of a tapas style eating experience... ordering a vast amount of small plates and sharing.  The sad truth is that nothing that I have ever tried/eaten here stands out in my mind.    It's all just \"okay\" and some stuff \"not so great\" ... I definitely didn't care for their pizza at all....  The big reason why I don't come here very often has to do with the high price points.  If you like to eat, which most Italians do ... It is nearly impossible to walk out of here without spending close to $80 for only two people, and I am sorry to say, but that is just far too costly for mediocre food.  The service here is also so-so ... And if you go on a busy night FORGETABOUT IT!! It will take you at least two hours to get out of this place ...  Overall, I don't have anything absolutely horrible to say about this restaurant, but I also can't think of anything good to say about it.  It's essentially a wash, which is why I gave it 3 stars.  It's clean, nice atmosphere, cool vibe, yet average tasting over priced food.  I have to give them credit for making an attempt to making typical unhealthy Italian food into healthy organic cuisine ... You absolutely have to give them an A for effort because I don't think I've ever seen another Italian restaurant offer healthy/organic options????  I can't exactly recommend it, but I can't say to stay away from it because who knows maybe you will love it?  So my best advice would be to try it out if your up for the challenge and don't mind paying :)",

It was a beautiful day, so we decided on outdoor seating.  I started with one of their fresh lemonade options along with the garlic cheese bread to start.  The flat bread was garlic-buttery good with a nice melted cheese on top.  Simple with a nice marina for dipping.  My co-workers split the organic hummus platter and really liked it.  For the main dish, I went full on Italian and opted for the Cheese Cannelloni, which came with a side of fresh vegetables.  I inhaled the cannelloni, and the side of veggies was definitely fresh and cooked to perfection.  Overall a nice place focused on fresh food (with gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan options).  When I am back in town, I will stop in again!",

The wait staff was very attentive and was very helpful and knowledgeable about her dietary needs. We had the gluten free focaccia with our caprese salad and it was amazing; to watch my besties face light up to eat tasty bread again was worth its weight in gold. She ordered the pizza (made in a specific gluten free oven) and was delighted to have enough for left overs for later. I had an amazing spinach salad. They have lunch specials for the gluten free patron. It was a good time. Plus the check in on yelp lead us to a tasty gluten free treat. I am glad I was able to find a place for my bestie to eat.",

Prior to the Buon Gusto's closing, we had contact them about hosting an event for approx 100 guests. After the closing and hearing about the planned reopening, we have attempted to contact Picazzo's through their website/email.  No response. Ever.  I have to wonder about any business that is willing to completely ignote a potential large booking.",

    "text": "Although I was excited to try a new pizza place, i was not impressed. The variety seemed a bit much for a gourmet pizza and salad joint. Many of the pizzas seemed to be very similar with the exception of 1 or 2 ingredients. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the option of gluten-free sounds appealing to those with gluten allergies. But overall, not many of the choices seemed desirable. I chose the 'fire in the hole' on regular crust. It boasted red and yellow bell peppers, fresh garlic, pepperoni, jalapenos, carmelized onions and cheddar with crushed red pepper flakes. it sounded exciting until i saw it and tasted it. The onions were not carmelized and they were oversized, allowing it to dominate other flavors save the jalapeno. The jalapeno were in medium slices, with the webbing and seeds intact. It is True that the pizza boasted of its spiciness with its eponymous title. But diced jalapeno without seeds or webbing would have added flavor and heat without compromising the other flavors. Perhaps the bell pepper and garlic were bland. Perhaps not.  On the plus side, I found the crust very tasty. But even with regular thickness, compared to thin or ultra thin, the toppings were too heavy  and the pie became a flaccid mess. For the price, I doubt I would get this one again. Finally, the waitress hovered around us. She was in my sight of vision, spot checking us every 20 seconds. This became cumbersome. She did not share any specials (not really sure if they have any) or recommendations on an entree or alcoholic beverage. Another waiter was quick about refilling our beverages without being noticeable.  Food was obnoxiously drab and the service needs to be less observable and more engaging with my palette.",

I had the lunch combo which included a slice of gluten free pizza, a salad (I chose the Asian salad) and my drink all for $9.  The gluten free pizza was to die for!  I have been to so many places where the GF pizza tastes like a sponge.  It almost tasted like their crust was made from a potato flour and was a little on the sweet side.  The portion of salad I received with my slice of pizza was rather generous.  It was definitely enough to fill me up for the price!  I highly plan on going back here and trying their gluten free pastas!",

    "text": "Was in Tempe for Angels Spring Training and in searching for gluten-free options nearby, came upon Picazzo's.  Yippee!!  It was AWESOME!!!  We actually need to have gluten free and soy free and this place nailed it!  This might have been one of only a handful of times our son could eat everything he saw on the table.  And it was good!  (My non allergic hubby loved it & would go back!)  We started with the kale salad (is Lyn-Genet The Plan friendly), which was tasty and what you would expect of a kale salad.  Then had mozzarella caprese, which was also very good and what you would expect (except had sliced avocado on side, which was odd but we loved!).  Came with a side of flatbread and we chose the gf version.  Then had Pizza Margharita and a custom pizza with pineapple, both on the gf crust (not the vegan crust).  Both pizzas were really good - liked the Margharita pizza best.  The level of garlic in it was outstanding.  Think the gf crust must be homemade because doesn't taste like any of the traditional pre-made gf crusts.  Wasn't the best gf crust I've ever had - kind of tasted like a cornmeal texture a little - but was still very good/tasty and would get it again!  The sauce, cheese, etc was awesome.   Have dairy free options as well.  It was Lent and a Friday so didn't try any of their meats.  Was celebrating a birthday so ended with the gf choc chip skillet cookie w/hot fudge and ice cream.  Chose the coconut milk vanilla ice cream, which I don't typically love, but this was amazing!!!  The cookie was out of this world and the cm ice cream was so creamy.  We actually returned home and bought that brand of ice cream ($6/pint!).  Given the higher cost of gluten/soy/dairy-free foods, I'm really amazed that there weren't surcharges for subbing these allergen friendly items.  Oh - and our bill was so reasonable!!!  Think we spent just over $60 for all of this!  Beyond the awesome food, the server (wish I could remember his name), was excellent!  He was super attentive!  The bus boy was there before we ever needed a water refill so was never looking to flag anyone down.  When we dropped a fork, a replacement was promptly brought over.  Even the food timing was great!  Everything came out much quicker than I would have expected, which was impressive given our order.  We did go at 5:30pm on a Sat so there were a number of people there but didn't have any wait.  Liked the ambiance - indoor or outdoor seating available.  Casual but clean and contemporary feel.  Very traditional Italian food with the option to customize it to allergen needs if you want (don't have to) and eat it in a healthier (organic/non-gmo), higher quality way.  On our way out, my son told me that I just had to write a review on this place, he loved it that much.  We will definitely return when in Phoenix area again next time.  Thank you for offering such an outstanding restaurant!  Proves that if you build a place with high quality food, people will come and return!",

We have been there at least a dozen times and the food is good. There is only a small bench for two people at the front of the restaurant where we sat and waited (we were a party of three). During that time four or five parties attempted to get in but decided not to wait and left. A few tables opened up where upon the hostess came to us and said that the manager told her not to seat any more people because the kitchen was backed up!? No place to wait, people lining up and tables opening up and telling your guests that you're not seating anyone..? Really? Seems like a bad decision. I can think of many hospitable ways to handle this situation to keep your patrons happy. That wasn't one of them. Needless to say we left  to go elsewhere. I'll still probably go back because their food and menu is certainly above average and the atmosphere is nice. But this episode was very disappointing.",

Not that I have anything against garlic, but three days after my Picazzo's experience I am still quite vampire-repellant.

We ordered Picazzo's pizza excited for a gluten free menu.  However, after paying $50 for two pizzas and one salad, we felt totally ripped off. The cheese on our pizza was like chewing on my dog's squeaky toys- flavorless and rubbery.  The tasteless pizza sauce was doled out the size of a thimble- and we wondered- \"How can this pizza that looks so delicious taste like nothing at all??\"  If I am gonna pack pounds on my hips indulging in pizza- Well, dangit! I want to enjoy it! My granddaughter who normally eats pizza like she's a pro wrestler refused to eat more after her first bites.  We told her it was magic pizza- that it would give her special powers- still she wouldn't bite.  She was right- this pizza has no magic whatsoever.  Next time I give away money for nothing- it's gonna go to the guy holding a cardboard sign on the corner!",

    "text": "The work of Picasso and Picazzo's have some things in common.  They're both beautiful, and they're both very EXPENSIVE.  (For a mere $26, you can own a large Margherita pizza.)  In an attempt to mix it up, we went with a medium Nonna's favorite ($17) and a large farmhouse salad ($15).  The pizza was good, but not outstanding.  Despite trying to avoid the Margherita, the fresh basil and tomatoes were the dominant flavor on this sauceless pizza.  The cheese was generously applied on a thin, chewy crust that was fine, but lacked the crispness I like on the bottom of my pizza.  The salad was more the star of the meal.  It was a very interesting mix of crunchy fresh vegetables (kale, cabbage, lettuce), roasted vegetables (brussel sprouts, cauliflower carrots), along with some dried cranberries and pumpkins seeds for more texture.  The chevre cheese in the salad was LEGIT, providing my favorite bites of the meal by far.  I hate an overdressed salad, but they went the other direction with this one.  It was underdressed to the point of almost non-existent dressing flavor, and the red cabbage dominated the overall flavor of the salad.  The happy hour was decent, and it's a family restaurant ambience.  I just can't get over the price.  We could see the TVs in the bar playing $5.99 Domino's commercials as we ate our $50 meal.  I'm more likely to buy a Warhol poster than another Picazzo.",

    "text": "Gluten-intolerant friends... there is hope!  Almost the entire menu here is gluten-free, save for a selection of pizzas.  Other common dietary restrictions could be easily accommodated here too.    We started off with gluten-free cheesy garlic bread.  Not being of the gluten-free variety myself, I am not used to the taste of those bread products and I couldn't get past how much different it tasted than I expected.  The rest of my table seemed to enjoy it though.  For my entree, I ordered the Butternut Squash Ravioli in Creamy Gorgonzola... yumm!  I love the squash raviolis, and I tasted no hint of the gluten alternatives in the pasta.  The sauce was creamy and flavorful, and the whole situation was on top of a bed of spinach, which complimented nicely.  I am a huge fan! The hubs had Pasta Bianca and I only tried a bite, but it was also excellent.    Our server was good, though nothing to particularly write home about.  He didn't mind that we stayed to chat for quite some time after settling our bill, mostly I'm sure because there were plenty of other open tables at the time.    It seems like the lighting was a bit dim if I remember correctly, but the ambiance was a nice typical \"restaurant\"y feel.  We didn't notice the juice bar in the front until we were on the way out!  It was a great meal, a good place for good conversation, and I left feeling stuffed and happy... just how it should be!",

I basically ate a bowl of expensive kale. Its not fun spending lunch wishing I had tried something else! My friend sent her dish back because it was cold in the middle - the staff was very nice about it but it delayed our lunch waiting for the new hot food to come out. When you're business is focused on Italian foods like pasta you'd think you'd make sure the pasta was heated all the way through. The service was good, and I'd like to give them another chance next time I'm in the area, it just wasn't a great first impression.",

    "text": "I can see why this location has lower ratings than the one in Sedona; on my recent visit to the Sedona location, my experience was nothing less than perfect. The same cannot be said for the Tempe location.  We sat at the bar because there was a 15 to 20 minute wait for a table, which makes sense on a Saturday night. That was the first mistake. The bartenders were much more occupied with making drinks than checking on the status of our food. While they were both very nice, they spent a lot of time talking to each other that probably could have been used more productively.  Our food was taking a rather long time to come out, even for a Saturday, especially since we had ordered an appetizer. When we inquired into the status of said appetizer, the male bartender went to check and came back with ALL our food at once. It was clear the food had been sitting for some time, as our vegan chicken wings and the vegan chicken on my salad were not even remotely warm, and my mom's pizza was just barely warm.  If the food had been delivered when it was first ready, it would have be absolutely delicious. No complaints there; kudos to the chefs and cooks in the kitchen! The bartenders, on the other hand, provided very poor service. My mom's drink, a berry mojito, was astonishingly bitter, and I love sour things. By the time we asked for to-go boxes, the two bartenders were so busy chatting with one another that the female one did not even bring all the containers I had requested, and I had to ask again.  Generally speaking, it seems like the quality of food is just as high at this location as it is at the Sedona location which my boyfriend and I so loved. However, when I return, I definitely will not be sitting at the bar, even if I have to wait 20 minutes for a table.",

    "text": "If you have severe food allergies BEWARE OF THIS LOCATION!!! Let me start out by saying that I am a huge fan of the company as a whole. The servers are always patient and careful with people who have food allergies (like myself) and the ingredients/recipes are top notch. That being said, this location is a MAJOR EXCEPTION.  Every single time I have eaten here, the dishes are made differently and they always include an ingredient I have specified as a severe allergy. Because these allergies are so severe, I make sure to repeat them at least twice, and usually friends emphasize this as well.   This last visit was \"the straw that broke the camel's back.\" I will never be visiting this location again and here's why:  When we ordered a loaf of the gluten-free, vegan flatbread for an appetizer, the server argued with me for 5 minutes about how it's not their policy to serve a loaf. I explained that we visit other the locations in Scottsdale, Flagstaff, Sedona, and Paradise Valley frequently and they all give the full loaf. The manager came out to explain the same thing and they didn't offer a solution.  When my cauliflower alfredo pasta arrived, I immediately noticed that it had peas in it, which were explained as a severe allergy. I don't necessarily blame the server because the kitchen should be responsible for preparing the dish exactly how it is described. She apologized profusely because peas are NOT part of the recipe, and had the kitchen remake it. Later that night and the following week I dealt with an extremely severe reaction, only caused by peas. It's hard to say if they just removed them from the original dish, or they were added to the sauce already and no one cared, but either way, that is absolutely unacceptable.  Besides having a reaction to the contaminated dish, it tasted extremely bland and not at all like dish normally does. Plus, the slice of gluten free vegan flatbread that comes on the side was also undercooked and tasted awful. Good thing we weren't given the full loaf!  I'm not sure why this location is so terrible in comparison to the others, but I sincerely warn those with food allergies -- DO NOT RISK IT -- drive a little farther to one of the other locations!!",

    "text": "Recently moved to the neighborhood and had a Groupon for Picazzo's and gave it a try this week.  We were there around 7:30 on a Tuesday - it was busy but not crowded.  The interior is decorated warmly and inviting. There is dining up front and a bar in the back with several large TVs.  However, the dining room was very cold so we elected to sit outside as the temp was nice.  There was one other occupied table outside.  The patio is quite plain but the chairs were comfortable.  The menu has a nice selection of starters, salads, pizza's and pastas along with a few non-pasta entrees.  They also have a limited beer and wine menu but I found an IPA I liked and my wife had a tonic and lime.  They have a build to order ravioli and gnocci option so my wife ordered sweet potato ravioli with pesto sauce and I had the gnocchi with Carbonara sauce.  The food arrived pretty timely but without a table service.  We had to remind the server for that.  I can never understand why that is not the first thing they check for when you sit down but hey, it was an easy fix.  The dishes were plated nicely in shallow bowels.  My gnocchi was cooked just right with a ricotta filling and the cause was creamy and garlicky with peas and pancetta.  It was quite tasty.  My wife's ravioli was outstanding with the sweet potato filling.  However, it really clashed with the pesto sauce.  It was a risk when she ordered it but frankly I would not offer that option, it really is a bad mix.  Since this was a quick dinner and we had the groupon discount I was satisfied with the meal.  However, had we wanted appetizers and/or desert the bill would have run pretty high for a casual restaurant. There are other better Italian food places within a few miles with better ambience, service and food at these prices.  I will go back and try them for lunch as I think this might be a better value and the outside seating would be attractive for that during winter days.",

My wife and I first came here and loved the food for the first maybe 2 or 3 visits.  Great first impression.. This was maybe 3 years ago.  Once in awhile we still order from here but are constantly reminded of the lack of consistency. For the past year, every time we pick up an order, we swear we will never order from here again.  Reasons:  1) too much damn garlic on everything, its repulsive sometimes you can't even eat the meal after spending $50+ between two people 2) Can't even order their spicy pasta because sometimes the spicy kick is perfectly hot, other times it's so hot you can't eat it 3) their $20 BBQ pizza came out burnt yesterday.  Who would serve BURNT crust and cheese in the first place?  Remake it before charing $20 for a pizza that tastes like cardboard 4) Countless amount of times they either got orders wrong or left something out and we'd have to call in and they'd \"take care of it\"... which they do.. but i'm tired of having to make 2 trips before I eat dinner 4) they are way too expensive for this inconsistency.  Sorry guys, used to love you, just exhausted after 3 years of being unhappy with dinner here almost every time..",

Such is not the case here. We chose this place because one of our party has a gluten allergy. Not everything on the menu is gluten-free, but they do take special care to make sure there is no cross contamination. My wife has a coconut allergy and was concerned about the menu having coconut in the ingredients. Our waiter checked to make sure there was no coconut in what she ordered.  I chose the lunch combo which is your choice of pizza, pasta or a baked dish; and soup or salad. My choice was the slice of the week (pizza) which was Italian sausage and caramelized onion. I also ordered the creamy tomato basil soup. In a short time my lunch was on the table. I could have made a meal of just soup. The tomato soup was smooth and creamy with basil and a hint of cayenne, nothing too intense. The pizza was also very good. Although the crust wasn't gluten-free it was still organic and whole wheat. They do offer a gluten-free crust.There was not a lot of sauce on the slice which opened the door for the other flavors to come through. The pizza was baked perfectly and had a generous amount of toppings.   Our waiter was attentive through the meal keeping our drinks full and answering any questions we had. I got a complimentary piece of raspberry cheese cake for checking in on Yelp. I was going to split it with my wife, but it contained a small amount of coconut. Our waiter brought her a complimentary scoop of ice cream since she couldn't have the cheese cake.  I am quite impressed with Picazzo's. This place totally exceeded my expectation of what healthy food should taste like. I would recommend Picazzo's to anyone with food a food allergy as they take strive to make a great tasting meal with respect to their dietary restriction.",

Nice restaurant, we liked the atmosphere but didn't eat there. We ordered 7 dishes mostly pastas and 1 pizza. We liked that the menu identifies the vegan options and we really enjoyed most of our food especially the pizza. The food got about 4 stars for me because of \"most\" of us liking it not all. But what took it to a 5 was the customer service. The cashier/ hostess was extremely helpful and answered all of our questions, we also asked for samples of the sauces that go on the pastas and she gladly got them for us. She was awesome but i don't remember her name. She made sure our order was perfect and fully vegan by making substitutions on some of the order.",

They shouldn't have the beautiful detail in the menu if they're really giving you some generic salad. Although maybe our server IS part of this review.

As far as their crust it is decent but far from perfect.  One of my favorite pizzas is the quarto fomarggi, (four cheeses for the Italian challenged) has Gorgonzola cheese, Alfredo, mozzarella, cherve (goat) and Fontina. the high fat of the fonina makes a smooth melt right into the Alfredo while the pungent cherve and strong flavor of the Gorgonzola are quite present. This is topped with basil and pears that really complement the mould cheese.  The inside of the location is decent, it mostly has tables a few booths and a new expanded bar. There also is a large patio with parking lot views for the cooler weather.",

Not sure where he came from, but he doesn't greet customers with a friendly vibe at all.  Both times with him serving, we sat with empty drinks for over 30 minutes.

All of my favorite things dishes have been altered or removed on the new menu, which is just bad luck on my end of course.  I totally respect the Green/organic and GF direction, but I feel that the changes were a bit too drastic, leaving my mainstream palate feeling alienated.  Came in for the new happy hour, was truly bummed out, since it used to be so good.  Could have understood the narrowing of options, and offering five dollar plates instead of full sizes at half-price, but the new recipes tasted plain awful, and I felt a bit screwed.  First: meatball sliders, served with avocado, Roma tomato, and a basil leaf I believe.  Sounds good, right?  In reality, a real bitch-kitty to consume.  Flimsy bread that disintegrated under the weight of a whole, lukewarm, dry, and practically flavorless meatball, combined with a *wedge* of avocado  - turned what is meant to be a finger food into a fork and knife affair.  The whole thing just fell apart after the first bite, and was tasteless to boot.  Pesto bread: the pesto soaked in to the bread in an unattractive way and was (again) bland, cheese was rubbery in the extreme.  And again on the GF bread, with no apparent options for something else.  I'm sure that it tastes awesome to someone who shits liquid for days after eating the regular stuff, I respect that.  But for me, blech.  Just give the option, please, don't force feed me the compressed crumbs bread.  Had I known better, I would have ordered it on foccacia.  Wish I had been given the choice on the happy hour menu.  Then, the stuffed peppers.  Wish I had known they were SO spicy and SO acidic, my palate was blown out with the first bite, glad it didn't precede anything else, or I wouldn't have tasted the rest of the meal.  Thankfully, the salads are still YUM and would be what I order if I ever return, since I am not a big pasta fan.  My favorite pizza, the shrimp scampi, is now neopolitan style.  Meh, no thanks.  And in my mourning, I don't want to try any others.  ;) Fickle, I know.  Decor is looking a bit matronly at this location.  I always remember the Flagstaff location being much brighter, airier.  This one feels...lackluster.      They obviously had to make some sacrifices in layout due to the size of the space, and as mentioned elsewhere, it feels a bit odd, even dowdy.  The feeling emanates from the staff as well.  All skilled, polite, and hardworking, don't get me wrong, but not lively at all.  Service is efficient, but not engaging, at least not for me.  GM is nice and gets the job done well, but always seems stressed.    One thing that put me off on my last visit - I mentioned my disappointment at the disappearance of the chalk-board happy hour, including $5 martini Thursdays, and my server's tone was borderline rude in replying.  She treated me like a rube, which I don't appreciate.  They had a good value for the guest and they took it away, probably because it wasn't making them any money, I get that and respect their change in direction.  But don't be rude to a semi-regular who is inquiring nicely.  Just smile and shrug, point out the new stuff, don't act like I am a chinz for asking.  I guess this just isn't my kind of place anymore.  The happy hour was really what brought me back and it is boring and flavorless now.  The organic thing is awesome, guys, but it still has to taste good!    They are catering to a niche market, I hope this suburb can support the location.  I love local businesses and hope they succeed.  Good luck and farewell, Picazzo's.",

    "text": "I was very skeptical going to Picazzo's when I saw that it was gluten free and organic. I expected to have limited options and tasteless food. I was completely wrong!  I was encouraged to see the place really hopping with both couples and families eating here. I wasn't very hungry so I only ordered a pepperoni pizza that my husband and I shared. However, he also ordered the Apple & Walnut Gorgonzola Salad and he's STILL talking about how great it was. When the pizza was first delivered to the table I was a bit disappointed to see the crust so thick (I prefer thin crust) because I expected it to be heavy. Again, I was wrong. The crust was light and airy and full of flavor. I never eat the ends of my pizza and I absolutely devoured it. It was served piping hot and was delicious all the way around. Our friendly server's name was Grace and she was terrific too. She made some great recommendation, she always showed up at our table about a second before we needed something and kept our drinks full. I cannot wait to go back here again and try something else. My only complaint is that I wish they were in Mesa! We drove 20 minutes to this place because we had a Groupon. But now that we discovered it we'll definitely be back. Loved the entire experience!",

    "text": "As someone not sensitive to gluten and an omnivore, the dinner I had here last night was very disappointing.  My wife was thrilled to see the fig gorgonzola pizza so we ordered a small one with a regular crust and the turkey meatballs as an appetizer so there'd be at least a little protein. The meatballs were decent enough and the tomato sauce was too, but they described it as spicy on the menu.  It is not.   The order came with \"foccacia\" to sop up the sauce.  But it turns out that they give you a corner of gluten free bread instead which of course instantly dissolves the second it hits sauce.  I tried a piece without sauce; it's basically off tasting cornbread.  Glad I don't HAVE to eat that. Turns out the meatballs would be the highlight of the night.  The pizza had no detectable gorgonzola and the \"balsamic vinegar\" was actually a sickeningly sweet balsamic glaze which just piled sweet upon sweet figs.  The crust had the consistency of Olive Garden breadsticks. While $17 might be in the ballpark for the gluten free version, this wasn't worth anything near that.  At $28, the 16\" version of this pie is highway robbery. I suspect that if you are one of the very few that actually have Celiac's (like my sister who loves this place), this place is paradise.  For the rest of us, there are so many better options like Dozo next door.",

Unfortunately, it is on the extra crispy side. The tip of the pizza was a black and the crust was super crispy. I did not attempt to eat the crust, way too hard. It was better last time. The soup and nonstop flowing of ice tea was good. The service is always excellent.",

    "text": "Me and my daughter (toddler) went here yesterday for lunch, another friend of mine came. We waited for someone to approach for about 5-10mins. No one came. So I went to the Juice Bar and asked the lady if we could just find our own table. She said, oh no , Ill take you and apologized. So we sat down, I had to ask for the kids menu, and a high chair..obviously, if you're  going to seat us and you see that there's a toddler, you're supposed to automatically assume that we need a kids menu and highchair or booster or at least ask if we need one. So she came back w the kids menu and highchair, the kids menu at most restaurants consist of a coloring paper and a set of crayons. So yes it was a coloring paper/menu..but no crayons, so I asked the server we didnt get a crayon. she said , oh no we dont have any...i said oh u ran out of crayons? and she said, no we dont give out crayons...  i was like , huh? OKAY... so my daughter who's 2 yr old got the coloring paper but no crayon good thing she didnt throw a fit, she just kept saying color color color.... so I just handed her my smart phone so she can play and keep her busy before she screams....  Ugh... that right there was a sign that we should have left and not order... but i was craving for some chicken wings... and we were hungry..we ordered chicken wings, and 2 entrees . was hoping the customer service will get better, but no! The server didnt come back to refill my empty glass of water and my friend had to call the server to ask for refill on his green tea.  The server came finally to offer if we wanted dessert... and became nice and all smiley towards the end, of course, because thats when she handed the tab... Well she still got a decent amount of tip because thats just how we are. But I just hope that they improve their customer service skills. Its a healthy restaurant, therefore, the people that work there must show some positiveness and encouragement with a smile.. :) that is all i wanted to share. I hope that whoever reads this, if you are the management, please address this to your employees.   Thank you.",

    "text": "I didn't think I liked Italian food before coming here. With dairy and egg allergies, eating Italian is nearly impossible and I'm always stuck eating some sad salad with nothing but leaves, oil and vinegar. BUT NOT HERE. WOWZAHS! I became obsessed with this place after a friend took me to the Sedona location and I fell in love with it.  The pizzas are fantastic and allow me to do vegan cheese with meat to accommodate my allergies. The crust is amazing--even my anti-vegan-food-fiance thought it was decent, which says a TON. I loved the BBQ chicken pizza and the cranberry jalapeno hummus is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Try it with the gluten free/vegan flatbread - it's super delicious and you'd never even know it was gluten-less.  The wings were a little bit too spicy and my moscow mule was a little too strong for my liking, but not enough knock it any stars.   The vegan cheezcake is pretty dandy too! If you check in to yelp while you're there, a free coupon for one just might appear.",

    "text": "It's been 7 years since my review for this restaurant. Time really does fly!  I wanted a healthy bite to eat for lunch so I stopped by Picazzo's and tried their new Buddha quinoa bowl. It is a salad/grain bowl with ingredients such as spinach, arugula, rainbow quinoa, avocado, roasted sweet potatoes, slivered almonds, shrimp, and coated with a cumin vinaigrette. That's quite a lot going on in a salad! I requested it with no feta.   The bowl came out and looked amazing. The colors and overall look was bright and fresh, and the bowl came with a slice of delightful focaccia bread. I think it was gluten free too.   Overall I enjoyed the different textures and flavors of the vegetables with the quinoa. The sweet potato was for the most part sweet and roasted, although there were a couple pieces that were more \"al dente\" and a little less cooked. The shrimp in the bowl were plentiful and well cooked but were too aggressively seasoned for my tastes. I also thought the cumin flavor was too assertive in the vinaigrette and tended to overpower the rest of the flavors in the bowl. I'd either use a different spice or use less cumin in the dressing if I were to make this bowl on my own. Most of the greens were fresh, but I did pick out a yellow spinach leaf out of my salad portion of the meal.  Service was friendly and swift. It was a warm sunny day so I indulged in the spacious patio outside while eating my lunch.  Even after 7 years Picazzo's is still a pretty good place to eat! Stop by for some organic fresh meals.  3.5/5",

The bill was much less, and the extremely incompetent manager admitted that it was a piece of glass, he said it several times that it was \"just\" a \"piece of glass\" from a portion bowl.  Additionally every staff member from waiter to manager handled the situation poorly making sure above all else that we knew it wasn't their personal fault and that \"these things happen\".  Glass in food is not something that just happens.  Nancy H. May have a future in the Trump administration",

The Tuscan chicken breast was flavorful & great for anyone on a low carb diet. My husband had a cup of tomato basil soup which he said was excellent & his caesar salad with chicken was very good too. Our friends both enjoyed their chicken parmesan & the only drawback was the pasta in one of the bowls had not been drained properly & there was a little water left behind. Otherwise, everything was good. I'm sure our vegetarian daughter would enjoy this place too! An extra perk for us was, since we are sustaining members of KBAQ & KJZZ, we got 10% off our bill! We'll be back.",

The meat eaters were satisfied and so were us vegans. I had the vegan elote pizza, and it was pretty good. The only downside was the greasiness of the daiya cheese, but I already knew that going into it because daiya always cooks up that way. I'd probably order something without fake cheese next time. The salads were fresh and everyone enjoyed their meal. The waitstaff was super friendly and helpful. It was clean and cute on the inside. Kinda bummed that you don't carry Italian ice anymore haha.",

Yes it is a bit pricier but it's all organic and gluten free, that means everything takes more prep and the ingredients are. More expensive to begin with. Our server was amazing. She already knew the soup of the day and refilled our water right away, even though our bill was small and we split a dish she never made us feel any less special.

This location is closest to us, so we dine here most, but it's probably my least favorite location in terms of food quality and quantity. This location seems to be stingy as far as pizza toppings when we create our own (though better as of late, and perhaps that's due to the new kitchen manager mentioned in a previous comment?), and I find the value for some of the items, like salad, to be pretty poor for the cost. A full berry salad is something like $15, which is pretty astronomical IMO. Some of the servers are excellent, some not so much.   That said, with my food sensitivities, we are thrilled to have a safe place to eat that tastes great with lots of options to suit all kinds of food preferences and needs. This is really one of the only places we eat regularly, and I've never had an issue where I felt bad afterwards and I trust that they know their stuff in regards to food allergies and what ingredients to avoid. Without Picazzo's, we wouldn't eat out much, if at all, and I'm very grateful to have a safe restaurant for nights out!   I just wish the prices were a little better, as I don't feel the value is what it should be for the price. If you have a restricted diet, it's more worth the price, but for those who can and do eat anything and everything, I can't imagine paying the prices here.",

No way to get the tea out of the vessel into the tea cup without heating up your fingers.

    "text": "Walked in tonight.  We had a Groupon and I had wanted to try this place for a long time anyway.  The place wasn't packed at 5pm (yeah we were eating early tonight).  Greeted immediately and given the choice to find a bar table or sit in main dining room.  The ambience was right on.  Minimalist decoration but perfectly adequate.  We chose bar seating.  Walking in, the bar was a little warm, but I think most places in the valley are overly air-condtioned anyway, so no big deal.  I like warm.  The guy behind the bar (later found his name was Augustin), was slammed.  He had a couple customers sitting at actual bar, but he was waiting 4-5 tables besides us in the bar area himself.  He made it over as soon as he was able and brought us food.  While the hostess who greeted us had been friendly, she had not offered us menus or followed us to bar with menus.  We did wait a few minutes to be recognized, totally understandable as busy as the guy behind the bar was.  When we finally placed drink orders, they ended up being out of the BF's beer-no big deal-he chose another.  Ordered right before end of happy hour (by about 11 minutes)-including a 1/2-off appetizer (hummus).  Later, we would be charged the HH price for hummus but not for drinks (meh...it would have amounted to $2 off anyway).  Hummus was pretty damn good.  Served with bean chips, bread, cucumber with olives and feta and a couple whole chickpeas on top.  5 stars for the hummus-especially considering the $5 price.  Food is local, organic, pricey-as expected.  We decided on quinoa bowls.  I got the super quinoa, BF got spicy Thai quinoa bowl, and the kiddo got kids create-your-own pizza.  Kiddo says his pizza was good.  He's a kid!  It looked dang good.  Also came with choice of sides, he chose strawberrries.  The side choices are healthy and awesome.  Our bowls were pretty darn good also, although, having visited Pomegranate Cafe in my own 'hood a time or two, I instantly compared the two and decided I would have preferred to pay same high prices at Pomegranate.  Augustin worked his butt off, busy the whole time, and never anything but absolutely friendly and professional despite never seeming to have a second to think.  About half way through our dinner, we noticed a woman behind the bar who had greeted us on arrival.  She was not wearing what seemed to be the traditional employee uniform of black polo shirt.  We assumed she was at least the manager if not higher up.  She made small talk with a patron at the bar, seemed very friendly, but also seemed to have gave 2 F***s that the only server in the bar was swamped and that we had ourselves waited 15+ minutes just for drinks.  That is super poor team work, let alone absolutely horrible managerial skills.  I will take some freedoms with making this claims, because I have been a charge nurse in a busy unit and would NEVER think of letting my nurses sink like that.  Isn't the purpose of a manager (or owner?) to provide all customers with the best experience they can have?  That includes helping a busy server who is literally killing himself managing EVERY table as well as every bar customer!  For this reason, as well as our wait because our poor waiter was being murdered with volume, this place gets 3 stars.  I may have otherwise given at least 4, if not 5.  The lack of support given by this woman was unbelievable.  Were I a restaurant owner, and if I witnessed ANY supervisor act with such utter disregard for team work and customer service, I may strongly reconsider that person's employment status.  This is how strongly I feel about her chatting up a single customer in front of us while we waited patiently for our poor server to have a second to look our way.  I want to be perfectly clear-we were given good service every chance he got to pay attention to us-but the fact that he was not given any assistance by the woman (who also BTW was noted to stand at the counter under the \"kitchen\" sign for a good deal of time-confirming at least her employment or involvement with the restaurant), literally left me angry.  Anyway...food 4.5 stars.  Service (when he could give us service-thanks Augustin) 5 stars-even though we waited quite a while to place drink order and receive ALL the drinks.  Team work/management-1 star.  Will I be back?  Meh!  Not sure considering I get more attention at Pomegranate Cafe for same amount of $$ and same great quality food.  Im not saying this is on my never list, but they need to step up their game.",

While a generous portion of bread, the tomato and mozzarella rounds were the size of roma slices. It was dull.   There were some interesting cocktails but my bitters and soda (which is club soda with a shake of aromatic bitters in it - helpful for upset stomachs) came in a smaller glass and I got charged for refills. I've never been charged for refills on bitters and soda before anywhere else. Frankly, that irritated me. Quite a bit.   I could have had a mojito for what my 3 club sodas cost.   And, I don't have a problem with gluten or a compulsion to eat organically so I'm not desperate enough to let those demands compensate.",

    "text": "This is a tough review to write because the food was delicious.  But we will not return for many reasons, and I think that those reasons explain my rating.  When you approach the building, the window reads \"gluten free\", \"organic\", \"non-GMO\" and lots of other marketing buzz-words, all of which may be True.  However, this prices here are far too expensive.  I understand that people will pay a premium for trendy organic food, but the ambiance here is reminiscent of a cafe or diner, while the prices are from a fine dining Italian restaurant.  $12 for a meatball-  appetizer?  $11 for a hummus plate appetizer?  $18 for pasta dishes?  $29 for 16\" pizzas?  So you logically assume that for those prices, it must be REALLY high quality - think again.  I had the gnocchi with spicy sausage, and it was delicious.  But it was $16.50, and that is steep for gnocchi in red sauce, so I asked the server if the gnocchi was made in-house.  He replied \"no\".  So I just paid $16.50 for someone to buy 3rd party gnocchi and add red sauce.  My wife had the spicy Thai peanut quinoa bowl.  Also delicious.  Just one problem - no quinoa.  It was essentially stir fried broccoli slaw with peanut sauce and some quinoa sprinkled over the top.  Again, we asked the server (who was a very good server, by the way) if there was supposed to be more quinoa in the dish.  He stated \"yes, but my pasta chef is out today\".  So we just paid $10.95 for a quinoa bowl with no quinoa (this is by far the cheapest thing on the menu, including most appetizers and salads).  To be fair, we used a Groupon, so the final bill was not as much as it could have been.  But I am writing this from the perspective of someone paying full price.  So in summary, the food tasted really good, and that's gets one star.  The server was solid, and that gets a second star.  But I cannot give any stars for ambiance or overall value.  If the prices were cut by 30%, I could probably get behind this restaurant in some way.  But right now I feel like the old Picazzo's, which I've eaten at many times, simply poorly reinvented itself as a trendy gimmick restaurant to capitalize on the wave of healthy fads.  I commend Picazzo's for identifying the unmet need in our community for healthier food, and many of the reviews on Yelp seem to indicate that this is appreciated.  But in my opinion, to justify these prices, a far better product and atmosphere is required.",

Everything is homemade, even the pasta!  My companion had the chicken parmigiana with the roasted sweet potatoes!  She raved about it as well.  She said you could taste the fresh ingredients.  We checked in here on Yelp and got a free dessert.  We choose the cheesecake, and after we ate it, Morgan told us it was \"diet\", meaning dairy free.  I would have never know that if she didn't tell me.  It was amazing.    The atmosphere was fun!  We sat outside on a covered patio with little white twinkle lights.  It was a cool Jan night, so the server put the heat lamp on for me, but I eventually asked her to turn it off, it was just so nice!  There was no wait to be seated, although the inside restaurant was busy.  They also had a bar area with a football game on the TVs, so something for everyone!  Parking was free and easy.  They are tucked into a strip center, and it didn't seem like the other businesses are open at night, which left them plenty of parking!",

I am thoroughly impressed and also highly recommend the Spicy Chipotle Chicken pasta ;)",

It's only fair since I've been back here seven or eight times since my first visit, and this after telling my husband we would probably not be coming back often. Lol'ing at myself. I wasn't especially wowed the first time we came, but in subsequent visits and having had a chance to try more of their dishes, I have found my go to's. The lasagna Bolognese is fantastic as is the chicken Parmesan. The new Crunchy Asian salad is delish! And I adore every single one of their desserts-the tiramisu, hot apple crisp, chocolate chip cookie with vanilla bean gelato, and the cheesecake are all wonderful treats. Picazzo's has become one of my favorite spots.",

They make  vert tasty bean soup, however my last visit was less than satisfactory and the reason why is they took one of my favorite dishes off the menu, the Buddha bowl.  So I decided on the kale and quinoa bowl. It had absolutely no flavor whatsoever, they added pesto but It was just lacking flavor and seasoning. I even ordered extra avocado to help  but it still didn't taste any better.  For dessert we had Taramasu, The best part of the whole meal. Please bring back your Buddha bowl!!",

The delivery service had lied, we took the pizzas, cancelled the delivery via phone and they NEVER even apologized! Again, AWESOME PIZZA, terrible delivery service.  UPDATE TO ABOVE REVIEW:  manager of the delivery service called me a few days afterward and apologized for the bad experience and refunded the entire order total (over $120).  I feel like they've redeemed themselves and hopefully will work at not having the same issues in the future.  He said the problems were due to someone being accosted, so who knows.

The place was a bit less than half full, we were seated promptly, and drink orders were taken. We both got the Lemonade which tasted a bit off - not sure if it needed more sugar, more lemon, or a bit of both, but it was not what we expected. We redeemed the free cheese bread for an appetizer for checking in and placed our order. The appetizer was delicious, not overly greasy and heavy, and the marina was delectable! It took another 20 mins or so for our entrees to arrive and it appeared there weren't many servers. When our food did arrive it was hot, fresh, and beautifully plated. The Cannelloni was amazing and I love that they also supply roasted veggies as a side. My husband enjoyed his chicken parm and we both ended up bringing home a doggy bag. Overall we are happy to have found another restaurant option despite the higher prices and wait time. The food is amazing, doesn't weigh you down, and the server, Keith, was very friendly. We will be returning to try some other dishes!",

    "text": "I've been trying gluten free restaurants lately so this was a must.  let's start with the decor, this place is super nice (not in the fancy/pretentious way, but in the casual, comfortable, cool way).  The service was also pretty good and the prices are not that bad, I mean, not cheap at all, but manageable.   We had the garlic bread, avocado delish pasta and build your own pizza.   I know this is going to sound funny but the garlic bread was too garlicky lmao. The EVOO that came with it was pretty tasteful.   The avocado delish pasta had also way too much garlic and the pasta lacked flavor. I was expecting more avocado (since that's the name of the dish) but there were just hints of it. If they ask my opinion, I would toss more avocado with a zest of lime juice and cayenne pepper to give the dish some personality.  The pizza was the best part of the dinner (besides the company, of course). If you're not gluten free, the pizza might taste weird but still pretty good (I'm not GF, just in case you were wondering).  For desert we ordered the apple cobbler but they were sold out so we ordered the cookie which was pretty good.  I'll go back to try other dishes for sure.  Cheers.  PS I'm curious about the name. If they named the place after the painter, I'll feel compelled to say that he was Spaniard and it's spelled with two \"S\". Just saying.",

My only complaint is that the toast is tasteless. I'm assuming it was gluten free and that's why it was a little different than I'm used to, but I think they could have added garlic to it or something.

First glance at the menu, wow these prices are high, which I understand because they are catering to the organic, free range chemical free crowd, which I have no problem with but it had better be top quality for that price point.   This location is new and looks nice, I like the Edison bulbs giving a soft yellow glow that you don't see in our CFL world. The space is tight and I felt like I was contributing to the conversation being had by the couple next to me.  On the the service. Not impressed. we were seated and had our waters quickly but my glass was never refilled, we were not checked on and the manger delivered our food because our waitress was nowhere to be seen. There were only a few people there and no one seemed too busy. On the plus side the kitchen seems to have their stuff together because our food was brought out quickly.  The food was okay, we ordered gluten free garlic cheese bread, it was a rice based bread and was served with olive oil. While it wasn't bad, there where no flavors that really popped out. For our dinner we had the Pepperoni, Sausage and Ricotta pizza. The crust on this pizza was great but again no flavors really stood out to me.   Overall I would try this place again, getting something other than the pizza just to give it a fair shake. I score one star for the atmosphere and one star for the food. Picazzo's looses three start due to the lack of service and the price for the quality.",

Despite the fact that it was 645 on a Friday evening, we were told they were out of the whole-grain crust. We were offered gluten-free and vegan alternatives. I explain to them that we were not gluten-free nor were we vegan so we did not want those crusts but that we would go ahead and just order the original.  We got the pizza to go. It took 15 minutes to get our order which was more than reasonable. However, it was not even worth the short wait. The crust had a weird taste and texture. Not sure if we somehow ended up with a gluten-free crust but it was very unpleasant.  It left an aftertaste that lingered and lingered.  The sauce and cheese tasted fine however, there was hardly any sausage on the pizza. Maybe 2 to 3 pieces per slice. Definitely not worth the $20 we paid.   We also ordered the Italian chopped salad.  The half-size was plenty for two people to share along with the pizza. However, the tomatoes were soft and mealy, Again, just really unpleasant. Kind of ruined the salad for both of us.  We will not be back.  edited to add that both my daughter and I ended up feeling sick all night long.  Stomach cramps and more.  Without getting graphic, it was a pretty rough night.  Now I'm wondering if that strange taste the pizza had was because something was off?",

    "text": "I love wings, and I especially like them crispy so the skin is worth eating. Their wings...not so crispy and too fatty. Good flavor, but fatty.  Hummus is one of my favorites, but their hummus had so much garlic in it that I'm still breathing garlic fire this morning after brushing twice and using a ton of mouthwash. Beware, it's one of those \"oh, but you taste so good. oh, but I know I shouldn't.\" And you do it anyway.  Their pizza is good. We had the shrimp and bacon, and the pepperoni, sausage and peppers pizzas. They ran out of bacon, which was a bummer because you could tell something was missing. And who runs out of bacon when it's on quite a few of their specialty pizzas? The other pizza was good, all of the peppers and onions made it sweeter and I wish the sausage and pepperoni would have added some spicy/saltiness to the pizza to balance that out. Great crust. Super tasty, slightly crispy, slightly chewy.  Happy hour is great, so I can't complain about how cheap it was last night.",

I forget the name of the pizza I ordered, but like I said: PAINFULLY good. it had pesto, mozzarella, chevre, artichoke, roasted garlic, sundried tomato, pine nuts, and fresh basil. I ordered it with plain crust & it was perfect, not doughy at all but fluffy & crisp on the outside. very fresh-tasting & delicious.  they have a wide selection of pizzas, including two entire (smaller) sections devoted to vegetarian options.  I ordered the small sized pizza & someone with a large appetite could probably finish most or all of it in one sitting, but I was able to get 3 meals out of it. it was, I think, $16.  I was tempted to call it pricey, but really, it isn't fucking pizza hut. you get what you pay for.  oh, and they gave us $10 off the bill for 2010!",

    "text": "Albeit a bit pricy, the artisan pizzas are the best I've found in Phoenix, which means I'm adding it to the best of Tempe list.  The restaurant has a trendy feel inside and some outdoor seating on a nice patio that faces the parking lot outside.  The only problem is that Picazzo's dropped my favorite pizza.  They went on an organic only binge and a hunt for locally produced ingredients and bye bye to the chipotle barbacoa.  Can I get a moment of silence for the chipotle barbacoa, a spicy pizza with hunks of seasoned beef?  And favorite number two has entered the witness protection program as the menu lists it under a different alias every time I visit.  It was originally called \"That's Italian,\" but now I just order the one with peperoni and salami.  Picazzo's is always running a lot of specials and has a happy hour.  Every week there is special, and they liked to do themes.  During tax season there was some kind of deal where large pizzas cost $10.40.  Oh, the irony.  So get on the mailing list if you like deals.  The bathroom is nice, clean, and worth mentioning in a review.  Unless you have actually tried Picazzo's, I don't even want to hear about how your favorite pizza place it better.  Because it isn't.",

    "text": "Setup of restaurant is a bit odd. When seated in main dining room there is a 3/4 height wall separating tables from service line & the television is mounted on wall behind service line making it impossible to see bottom half of the screen. Their ice  machine backs up to the 3/4 wall & our table was right against the wall behind the machine so we had to listen to the fan or motor running throughout our whole meal. No where near the atmosphere of the Sedona patio location.   Their hummus had way more garlic than the picazzo's in Phoenix - too much for me but SO loves garlic so he was happy to eat it all.  Service was very quick even for refilling the water glasses.  Berrylicious salad was verry berry yum. I could eat it for dessert. I wish I'd taken a picture of it, it was so good, lots of walnuts, berries & oranges. So much more flavor than the kale & berry salad I tried yesterday at Nourish.  I just wish the gluten-free crust was vegan  & didn't have eggs so I could enjoy it, especially since they carry vegan cheese. But I scraped the veggie toppings off & SO ate the crust which he loved - thinks it is even better than \"normal\" pizza. He really doesn't mind being gluten-free & the  vegan cheese but now that he's tried this pizza I'll have to be satisfied with turning him vegetarian instead of vegan, at least while visiting in Picazzo territory. Still a vast difference from the eat everything diet of 6 weeks ago. He's eating way healthier & saying it \" are you sure this is healthy? It tastes too good to be healthy\"",

When it was operating under a different name the quality slipped a bit. when it switched back we decided to try it.  Bad decision.  We ordered a large Greek salad and garlic cheese bread.  the first thing we noticed is the salad was about a third the size it had been with the original Picazzos and even though the menu said the Greek salad there were no olives at all.  a Greek salad with no olives?  The dressing was thick and clumpy.  The garlic cheese bread was bland with no flavor.  It was supposed to be on foccia bread but was closer to Texas toast.  the bread was so blah we barely touched it.  when we told our server he just shrugged at the lack of olives and said yeah they had had a lot of complaints about the cheese bread because they were changing the menu but hadn't updated it yet so the bread was actually vegan it just didn't say that. Huh?  for vegan might have been great but that's not what we ordered or why  we were there.  The server didn't offer to take it off the bill or do anything really.   Bottom line we won't be back.  guess that explains why there was only one other table who back a few years ago the place would have been almost full even on a Tuesday night.",

Oh and the salads are really big, 4 people shared a small (appetizer portions)! One negative about the experience was the waiter though.  This kid just didnt seem to know very much about anything, and wasnt very attentive to our large group (10 people).  When a friend asked about a beer he was unfamiliar with, the waiter described it for him, \"Its from California.  Its good.\"  when he asked about another beer, his description was very similar (although slightly more helpful), \"Its our darkest beer, its good.\"  Maybe they can educate their staff a little better about their menu.",

I waited then went to pick up my lunch. They didn't have it made because they never got my order. The girl said it happens all of the time. :( I waited another 20 minutes for them to make my quinoa bowl. I get back to work and am eating my bowl when I realize they didn't put any chicken on it. I double checked the menu and all of their bowls come with chicken.   To say the least, to pay $11 for the bowl and I gave the girl a $2 tip because she was so nice to me, that's the most expensive salad with the least satisfaction I have ever had.",

The salads were good but were ALL lettuce, not much else then a cucumber slice and two small tomatoes. Upon my request for extra salad dressing I was told \"no.\"   The counter girl must be new because she had no idea what she was doing and was not polite in the slightest. She gave me overflowing sodas which spilled all over the counter and I had to ask multiple times for napkins to wipe off the access soda.  For a small slice of pizza and salad, the cost was $14.

    "text": "UPDATED REVIEW:  This was a 4-star review, and now it's a 2-star review. For the 5TH time, we have ordered take-out from picazzos and gotten the wrong food. Not only am I upset that it's the wrong order, but we specifically order VEGAN every time we go there, because we do not eat animal products. Please don't offer vegan if you can't take it as seriously as vegans do. This time we got REAL chicken in our meal!! Luckily I can tell the moment I see it that it's real chicken. We always double-check to make sure they confirm that they heard \"vegan option\" when we specify. This is not only offensive to the vegan community, but it is sickening that we had to go hungry for lunch because your employees don't take the time to listen and double check orders before sending us out the door. I absolutely will never order take-out again  from picazzos Tempe. As a repeat long-term customer who has been coming to your restaurant for over 4 years, I will not recommend picazzos to my vegan friends EVER again (and I have fed over 20 people at this restaurant over the years). The only reason I'm not giving a 1-star review is because dine-in service is good (when the food is vegan).  Original review: I really love the vegan gluten free options here.  When dining in, I always have great experience with the food.  Ordering take-out is not great here.  I have been overcharged, given the wrong pizza, and only given half the portion size of pasta that I would get if I dined in (yet paid the same high price).  I was even given nearly raw flatbread instead of fully baked bread. I would be happier to wait 45min to pick up my food if it meant better quality and larger portions that are worth the price.  Please take your time with takeout orders and don't worry about competing with low-end pizza shops on pick-up times, nobody else offers organic gluten free so you don't need to rush to get it done.",

Happy Hour is the only time I would eat here.  Appetizers are 1/2 off and alcoholic drinks are $1 off.    With Happy Hour pricing a friend and I shared a caprese and I had a peach bellini and she had a glass of cabernet.  The bill was $25, with tip.  I think that is pricey!!!  The caprese was good except for the bread.  Not a fan at all.  The peach bellini was DELICIOUS!!

Not many places are open at 11:30am on a sunday morning that you can get a quick bite but luckily for us, Picazzo's came to our rescue.  This restaurant wasn't at all what I expected. It turned out the Picazzo's is a super healthy Italian place with lots of salads and an extensive juice bar. I recently got onto the juicing kick and opted for the Green Machine juice. It could have used more apple to sweeten it but it was fresh and delicious.  As I said, we only had 30 minutes so the waitress recommended salads for us. I chose the kale salad and immediately I knew it was going to be a good one. The kale was the darkest kale I have ever seen and super frilly (maybe this is a special type of kale that isn't available at Whole Foods?). The greens were dressed with a lemony dressing and sprinkled with almonds. It was delicious and super good for you. My husband had a cranberry salad which he also enjoyed. You can get kale substituted in any salad free of charge as an investment in your health.  I loved the super healthy selection of food, not that I don't like my greasy deep fried food either. But if you need to get your vegetables in and are craving some extra fiber in your diet, please go to Picazzos.",

The olive oil served with the salad was dark in color and I believed it to be a blend (not Pure olive oil) or poor quality. The server was not friendly or helpful. I thought the prices were high.

However my GF guest and I chose to sit at the bar at 7pm on a Wednesday expecting a faster paced meal, as opposed to the dining room. We ordered a salad followed by a pizza and twenty minutes after we finished our salad our server/bartender came over to inform us that the cooks forgot about our pizza and it was burnt so they would be remaking it and we would have it out quickly. Another twenty minutes went by and we received our pizza. When we received our final bill there was no discount or any kind of guest recovery offered, which I thought was odd and discourteous, due to the extended waiting time.  My gluten free guest will most likely be back due to lack of better options, but I would not choose to due to the staff's disinterest in my negative dining experience.",

I honestly would rather have Domino's or Pizza Hut.  I think I know the issue, though - they are one of very few pizza places that have truly gluten-free pizza, and we have a few folks in our family who are gluten-free, so I totally get it that those folks need pizza too. But the issue is that gluten-free bread of any kind just doesn't usually taste very good. Ask any gluten-free person and they will tell you the same. And even the regular pizzas here taste like they're gluten-free! It's like, listen folks, when I want pizza I want literally all the gluten you can throw my way. Bring on the week-long bloating and the tummy troubles!  So to sum it up: this place is a solid one star for anyone who is not gluten-free. It's probably a lot better for people who are, and who don't have the option for real pizza deliciousness.",

Ordered two lunch specials and the garlic and Brie appetizer. Lunch plates came out and we asked where the Brie was. Server forgot to place the order. 7-8 minutes later the appetizer comes out. The Brie is an overheated greasy, oily mess and there's no garlic. We inform the manager, and then are brought out a small container of room temperature cooked garlic cloves. My guess is this was pulled from the prep bin for their pizzas as it's usually two freshly roasted bulbs of garlic. Very unappetizing and truly disappointed. Only received a quick \"sorry\" from the server for the whole thing. Probably won't return, unfortunately.",

Since you didn't let us know in advance we're not offering you any kind of compensation.\"  WOW.  So while unhealthy places, like your regular chinese food restaurant, is phasing out MSG,  \"healthy\" places like Picazzo's are dousing their food in it.  BTW, Manager, we will NEVER eat at a Picazzo's again, and your \"compensation\" probably would have been more bogus \"healthy\" food at your unhealthy restaurant.   My b/f said \"We never had a problem before is the MSG thing new?\"  and the manager said \"We use a lot of it now, that's all I'm going to say\".  I hate places that gradually downgrade/degrade their quality in favor of making greater profits.  Please people,  do not ruin your health and let places like this fool you.

It was delicious and it was so nice to be able to enjoy a pizza dinner with the non-gf family members and not feel left out.",

My boyfriend who is a died-hard vegan ordered 4 items from the menu because he did not believe any of them would be good. HE WAS WRONG! They were all delish. However; there is a small issue: on the first visit we sat outside and the smell was horrendous. It smelled like sewage. We have eaten there 4 times in a week and the smell is only outside on the patio near the corner of FLWright. Despite that small issue we love the place! Could you open one in Harrisonburg, VA?",

    "text": "We created our own vegan pizza which came out really delicious. We were not charged extra for switching out the dairy cheese for non-dairy which I find just mean when restaurants do that and the ingredients were fresh tasting. Sadly we couldn't get the multigrain crust because it wasn't vegan, but the vegan one (we did not get gluten free) was still really good.   Ordering was a bit of a hassle because our waiter said he'd come back when we were halfway through ordering, because we were taking too long I guess. He went and took someone else's order then walked a way for a bit longer than we would have thought necessary, especially since we had started ordering first. Kind of strange. We had questions and needed to figure out or order based on his answers. Otherwise a good meal.",

Especially the pizza which is like none other. The gluten free crust is fluffy and flavorful, nothing like the cardboard thin stuff at other places. Also all the pasta dishes are magical. I know magical is a subjective word but guys, I don't have other words... Nothing else accurately describes the deliciousness.   The only consideration you may have to think about is the price. You pay more here than say an Oreganos or a Nellos pizza, but for me the price is worth the food.   Also at the Tempe location our waitress Michele was so great, she was attentive but not too disruptive or pushy. Thanks for a great dinner and service.",

    "text": "\"Both ghee and clarified butter have the milk proteins (casein and whey) removed and what remains is butter fat. Casein and whey are proteins in dairy that many people do not tolerate, especially people who cannot tolerate gluten\".  The following excerpt is for the staff / employees at this location to help them better understand the difference between Butter and Parmesan cheese.  If someone is asking about Vegan and Gluten and Organic options etc; it might be worth while telling someone if you plan on adding cheese to their order without telling them. In this instance it was very clear I had not seen this item on the menu, that I had food allergies and was trying to ask what went into the order. Maybe I didn't ask enough questions perhaps, but still. This is just for future reference not to be rude or mean.  I was already pretty stressed and feeling VERY VERY ill when I got there so this in combination with a few other minor mishaps was the icing on the cake.   Apparently if you walk in with a $20 it a big deal and they have to find the person that originally placed your order and then walk all the way over to the bar for crying out loud just to get you change. As if you just walked into a late night convenience store in the middle the night and all the real money is hidden and locked away.  The food is really good though and the service overall is pretty decent. However paying a bit more attention to detail and the basics handling order might be help things run a lot smoother in the long run with less stress for everyone.  Thanks!",

First time visiting I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza with vegan chicken, the server charged us 3 dollars for the vegan chicken. He was really slow too when it wasnt busy (only 3-4 tables including us) . The second visit I realized on the menu it said substitute vegan style with no charge :(. Still like the food here and have came back multiple times. Just didn't have good experience the first time.",

    "text": "I LOVE this place and with good reason: Picazzo's has a separate gluten-free menu (which can be found online) for celiac sufferers, as well as those who are more sensitive or allergic to the effects of wheat. Kitchen utensils and ovens are reserved for the preparation and cooking of gluten-free doughs and other goodies. This helps prevent contamination, which can wreak havoc on one later. For the most part, the GF menu is exactly the same as the regular menu and this is a wonderful thing. A GF diet can be VERY restrictive, but Picazzo's has really gone out of its way to accommodate those of us, who cannot tolerate gluten and has won several awards for having done so. How many restaurants can truly say that?  Neither the dough nor the toppings are bland. The salads all taste delicious. The servers are always quick and very courteous, and they take the time to get to know you by name when you are a regular. The prices are a little excessive, but I think the quality and freshness of the food is outstanding and that this is well worth paying a little extra to obtain. It's definitely a value call for all of us, but the peace of mind and shear delight afforded me by this restaurant's having a separate GF menu and cooking facilities makes this a top choice for me!",

    "text": "I came here for lunch with a few friends on a Saturday, and we were all pretty disappointed. Overall, Picazzo's seems pretty full of themselves. When one of our drink orders came out wrong (diet coke instead of regular) the server looked at us like we were nuts. Sorry? Really didn't think that should have been such a big deal.  The food was not worth the price, it seems like this restaurant thinks they can get away with murder because they are all over organic ingredients and gluten-free crusts. Gluten-free or not, the margherita pizza was bland and tasteless. Covered in a thin sheen of olive oil (for flavor?) and skimped on the tomatoes and basil, it was dolled up cheese bread. The fruit and brie appetizer was okay, but the attention paid to presentation made it nearly impossible to eat. The pear-half and strawberry that came with our hunk of melted brie were really just incompletely sliced and that was supposed to look frou-frou? We had to remove the fruit to slice it completely so it could actually be eaten by more than one person; sort of the point of an appetizer, right? They also threw two heads of roasted garlic in the brie. While I can't deny that a whole head of roasted garlic is a beautiful thing, papery garlic skins mixed in with your melted brie are not. Neither is having to squeeze scalding hot cloves of roasted garlic into your brie. I was the only one in my group of friends who has roasted my own garlic so I had to wrap it in my napkin and squeeze it out onto a plate, again so more than one person could actually eat it. At this point we were all laughing at the ridiculousness of the restaurant and it's prices.  I hate to rate it so low, because I really think there could be potential here! Italian food gone organic and accommodating to dietary needs? Could be great, just seems like they've got no soul and there is no real attention paid to the quality of the food, which comes across as just profiting from the bandwagon.",

    "text": "This was my first visit. I am always happy to hear of Organic Restaurants. I can say we were very disappointed. It was a Monday eve we sat on the cute little patio as the weather was nice. Within a few minutes the busboy was clearing the cushions off the patio furniture and windows were being cleaned. We felt they wanted to close and we felt we were an inconvenience. The Butternut Ravioli w Vegetables arrived cold and was in a sauce resembling  milk and the\" vegetables\" were just a few quartered artichoke heart's, the garlic was overpowering and I do like garlic.This tasted  like it wasnt cooked enough and made a strong bitter taste . My daughters cold Ravioli Carbonara was mediocre and the bed of spinach it was on was also over garliced.  The Medium sized 6 piece Vortex Pizza was not bad but at the price of 21.50 we expected much more of a Wow factor. I realize organic food costs a bit more but this was crazy over priced food that well,,,tastewise could have been in the ballpark of an Olive Garden or Rigatoni's.  The bill total for 4 people actually came to the same price we payed at Fine Italian Restaurant Tutti Santi that included Dessert.  I was going to bring an out of town guest next week if we enjoyed the food but will definitely go to the High End Italian place.. The only thing I enjoyed here was the Lavender Limonade Cocktail .  I never mind paying more for my dinner but expect to leave with a smile and a satisfied palate",

I ate so much of it that i could barely have main course which was a medium pizza, half vortex and half leaning tower.  more on the brie. i loved the roasted garlic. and the sweet strawberries and apple were such a great combination with the cheese and all the herbs on the bread.   minus one star cuz the waitress served my pizza upside down on my plate and offered zero compensation.   minus one star cuz the cheese on the leaning tower was too melted! it was the most watery cheese i've ever had. maybe that's why it's called the leaning tower... it causes all the toppings to fall off!  also, the pizza crust was a bit too doughy. i don't mind thick crusts but this crust actually tasted like dough....",

Decided to order a glass of wine (excellent) and the garlic bread, since I thought my daughter would like it. The drinks came out quick...then...the \"rush\" hit, and .the wait game begin. After seemingly like forever, our appetizer came out, but only not the garlic bread but the warm brie. I should have taken that as providence and kept it...but...didn't. Much later, the garlic bread came out. Honestly, it was so not worth the wait. it was for the most part totally unmemorable. It needed more garlic or some flavor. Waited. Waited. Waited. Finally our dinner came out. My pizza was just short of cold, on the luke warm side, so i'm guessing that it had been in the window for a while. My daughter's pizza was super steaming hot. She did the kids Hawaiian, and that was pretty tasty. Mine had a good taste, but cold pizza just wasn't overly appealing. Saw our waiter several times, but never seemed to be able to get his attention, so the wait game begin. I finally asked on of the other servers if i could get our bill. I'm really hoping that I caught them on an off-night. I love having something organic and gluten free, and I'm even willing to pay more for it. i just wish that the taste and service were like they were the last time I was there (believe was Buon Gusto then).",

This may become my go-to place when I don't have the energy to make a salad (I detest washing greens) and really want a healthy dinner.",

    "text": "Edible... that's how I'll describe this food. I ate it - cleaned my plate even. I had a lunch special which was a half-salad and a slice. The slice was a \"runt\" as the waiter described it and swore most slices were larger - he then brought out a second \"runt\" for half price to make up for the small portion of food.   It's a very generic place considering how much my girlfriend and friend raved about it. These are usually located in small corner strip malls and the decor is entirely forgettable. I had a good look at their bathroom and i thought it was nice and clean and they provided little shot cups so you could have a bit of mouthwash... classy.   I should point out that I'm a pizza purist and prefer cheese or pepperoni or sausage or all 3, but not much else... I'm told that this place is great if you like a large variety of toppings. So take my review with that in mind.  I thought the dough was bland and dry and unappealing. Flavorless, but capable of holding up the thin layer of toppings. I imagine they skimp on toppings because you are supposed to order many many toppings. That probably explains why the bread is sturdy. Still, my friend's slice was loaded, but looked sparse as well.   The cheese was also completely flavorless even though they sprinkled some parm on the top. The pepperonis were okay I guess - I like them thicker and more spicy though. The sauce was flavorless as well... overall a pretty bland and boring pizza experience. It reminded me of Dominos flavor-wise (or lack thereof).  After eating, I was hanging out in the parking lot talking with my friend and my food suddenly hit me and gave me the shits - that's why I got a look at the bathroom. I wouldn't put money on it that it was definitely the pizza that gave me the browns, but it was the only thing I had eaten that day. It's entirely possible it wasn't the food though since I ate a bunch of candy the night before.   Anyway - everyone's taste in pizza differs... I'm not a fan, but you may be. This place gets a 2.5/5 from me - it's pretty average. More experimental foodies might love it. People who like simple pizza may want to look elsewhere.",
