It's my favorite  They have kool-aid on tap which is another plus and therelaxation snack menu has notchos which is Doritos chips withave cheese olives chicken if you want it and jalapenos! I've been coming here since I was in high school!  Only down fall is the don't always clean tables off in a timely manner as there is not a lot of staff but they are always nice and will if you ask.",

The goo balls, especially the one with Captain Krunch, was excellent under the right conditions. The rest of the menu plays out a bit different, but the use of spring mix in all the sandwiches really sucks. That kind of lettuce belongs in a salad, not a sandwich. My order was a pretty simple humboldt, but you need to remove that lettuce to enjoy the sandwich better. This chain used to let you add ingredients as you go down the line (after toasting), but now it;s whatever is on the menu you get. Obviously, most customers might be in another mindset in which anything tastes good, but the experienced gourmet 420 people should be thrown a bone as well.",

I tried it twice and At first, I thought it was 4 stars but then I quickly forgot about it so why 4 stars for a place that did not stay in my mind so I gave it a 3 stars, should be a 3.5. It is an above average place, but the two things I saw that made it sink in the stars was the portion, little meat, maybe 2-3 layers about it covered up wih the cheese melted on it. The bread is okay, but the flavor or lack of was the same as most other places. Nothing really stood out in terms of seasoning or sauces or taste. Don't get me wrong, it is a well done sub, other ingredients are fresh, have cool names but really still the same subs everyone else offers. They are one of the better well done subs, but again, I quickly forgot about it until I was in that part of Mesa and stopped by. It is still a place I would recommend but not a 4 or 5 stars.",

    "text": "The first couple of times I ate here I wasn't sure why people were always so crazy for this place. It's been about two years since my last visit and in the past couple of months I've already been here like three times and wanted to go back more. I've decided that it's all about what you order; for example the first time I went I probably felt overwhelmed with all the choices and decided to go for something really plain like turkey with hardly any toppings, have fun! Their menu has a wide variety of yummy sandwiches and lots of new tastes to try. Also, don't be afraid to speak up. I was a little disappointed by the lack of lettuce and veggies on one of my veggie sandwiches but I also didn't pay attention. Now I ask for lots of lettuce and they're happy to make it the way I like. They make their breads fresh and they have garlic-herb bread that has lots of flavor. I won't order a sandwich from there without a side of ranch dressing. I am a picky ranch eater...I hate mayonnaise so I am always super careful that ranch doesn't taste or resemble mayo. I usually like restaurant mayo that is a little more runny in consistency with lots of flavor. They have the best home made ranch dressing here! Pair it with the garlic-herb bread and your sandwich is going to be booming in flavor. OMG! Wipe...sorry I just started to drool a bit. Service is good...everyone runs at the same chill pace which seems to go well with the theme of this restaurant. My current favorite is the Humboldt sandwich...I get the Pinner (8\") but I swear some days I am so hungry I think I'm going to order the Blunt (12\")...maybe someday soon. All sandwiches get toasted. Okay so toppings: Guacamole, sprouts, lettuce/spring mix, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, black olives (I get mine w/o), cucumbers, pickles, your choice of cheese (I get Swiss), with their house goodies (EVOO, vinegar, herb mixture on top). Now that I found my sandwich, I crave it all the time and can't wait for my next visit. Oh, be sure to check their daily specials too! If you're lucky enough to be in their delivery area...well, darn you then! :-)",

At some point, I'll expand my horizons and try another selection from their menu, but alas,  'loyalty' is \"strong with this one.\" Trust me, it is a gift *and* a curse, TBH.  My \"Chicks,\" who are sandwich snobs, have decided that they prefer this establishment over the \"Mainstream Sandwich Pimps\"--and that, is a feat in itself...",

    "text": "My husband loves Cheba Hut whereas until recently I just thought it was okay. It's a sandwich place with a stoner/weed theme and okay, bro. 4/20 Blaze it, I get it. If I was new to marijuana, I'd had been stoked to find this place but I'm not new to this (I'm True to this) so I was kind of like, oh, this is different. I've never been to any place in New York that so openly celebrated getting high. The sandwiches are named after different strains of weed and even the sandwich sizes are weed oriented - nug, pinner, blunt. But, Cheba Hut is cute and funny so we went every so often. PLUS, I will say that they play great music. I've heard them play some Mos Def and Talib Kweli that I've only ever heard played in my car so that's an automatic win to me. Anyway, I've tried the Kush, the KGB, and the White Widow and each time they were good but not great until my most recent visit. My husband and I split a blunt sized White Widow, loaded up, with extra ranch and extra mayo. I also tried their red Kool-Aid and rice krispie bar - everything was so good. I think the issue was that I hadn't been getting my sandwiches loaded up. I was full from sandwich and just couldn't stop eating my rice krispie bar. It was like I had the munchies, lol. I'm not a big Kool-Aid drinker since usually people make it too sweet but this Kool-Aid tasted great, not too sweet at all but just sweet enough. It made me see why my husband loves Cheba Hut especially if his sandwiches always taste like that. I've since switched jobs so I'm not as close to Cheba but I know we'll back soon. Definitely try that White Widow with extra ranch, as per many of the other reviews; it's clearly a fan favorite.",

I haven't been to one in a while, but I was extremely pleased with my experience. We came in on a Saturday night, around 10PM. The young man at the register greeted us as soon as we walked in. He also confirmed how I wanted my sandwich and if pickles were okay, which was thoughtful of him to do. He also comped my drink and a brownie that we had decided to purchase after my total was rung up.  The ambiance was fun, there was good music playing, but it wasn't too loud. Three or four other groups of customers already eating were all having a good time. The food seemed to take a little longer than expected, but was great. My boyfriend and I both got White Widow pinners, with which we were very pleased. Their Yerba Mate iced tea was also yummy. The prices were reasonable and I will definitely be returning, especially to this location!",

The meats are all excellent quality.  Top notch AK-47 (French Dip)  and the 5-0 (Italian)  Cheba Hut also has the best pickles which is huge.  Must order the hot pepper salad or whatever it's called the geanara or something.   It is a must have on the 5-0.  The staff is way great as well.  With the loud music and artwork, it feels like a ganja bar, a total escape.  Love this place!",

    "text": "I'm  going to go out on a limb and say outside my dinky half-pint kitchen, Cheba Hut offers the best subs in the area.   One would think, \"Oh Cheba Hut is all about the ambiance. You are paying for the experience, not the food\". But to that I say, \"Nay, good Sir. Cheba Hut subs doth rock mine socks.\"  As other reviews stated, the subs are named after different kinds of weed and the sizes are nugs (4\"), pinners (8\") and blunts (12\"). There's tacky weed stuff everywhere. Very \"groovy\" to say the least.  The subs are toasted (on white, wheat or garlic herb bread) and loaded up with all sorts of interesting ingredients. No boring sammies here, unless you so choose (looking at you, ham and swiss dude).   I recently had my first vegan sub at Cheba Hut and it was AMAZING! I had my girlfriend build me what I affectionately call \"The Angie\". It was a Majic Mushroom (teriyaki portabello) with pineapples, onion, fresh mushrooms, sprouts, cucumbers, bell pepper, greek dressing, tomato and probably some other stuff I can't remember.   Amazing!   The only thing that creeps me out about Cheba is that you can't see your sandwich as they're making it. I worry that the line is really dirty or that they are flossing my bun with a strip of bacon. It kind of adds to the experience though because you don't know how your Cheba Hut creation will look until it's right in front of you.  The place does get kind of loud, so be prepared.  Also, they used to deliver but according to Yelp they don't...so something to look into.   It would be a shame if stoners had to get behind the wheel in order to get their Cheba Hut fix.",

We would place a pickup order and EVERY time they would tell us we could pick up in 20 minutes. 5 times in a row I had to wait an additional 40 minutes (After the 20 minutes i was told) in the store for the food to be done. The last straw was last week when I had waited over 1 hour in the store.  An employee asked what the order name was and I told them.  They then informed me that they hadn't even started making my order yet! They had forgotten or somebody had misplaced it.  At this point I felt the need to tell the manager about my experience.  His exact response was \"If you don't like the service why do you keep coming?\"  I was appalled as was the employee standing next to him.  Now knowing that they have no care for other people's time or respect I will NEVFR return to this place!",

So, having trusted Z on many a thing and as he would tell you, always trust him when it comes to food, I was gleefully happy at the end of my eating experience.   There are a lot of subs to choose from and it took me about 5 minutes to finally decide on the La Canna. Salami and ham with provolone and olives. Get it on the garlic-herb bread. Have the happy dude behind the counter throw on some spicy mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, oil & vinegar, Parmesan, and oregano. The sub is toasted and doesn't shred the rough of your mouth, which happens to me quite frequently. I was still not satiated after this sub, so I split the White Widow with Z. Marinated chicken, bacon, provolone and ranch dressing. Again another great sub.   The employees were all in a good mood. Not sure if that was herb induced or not, but it was pleasant. Phylis behind the register was particularly kind. She came complete with the stereotypical stoner laugh. She's cute.   It was totally worth the drive and I will be back in the future to try something else.",

First off we walked in and there are 8 people working and we are THE ONLY customers in the store. The TV was on with Tremors 2 playing at an unbearably loud level.(So we chose to eat outside, at least we got a lightening show too. We yell out order to the guy and we wait. It took a good 13+ minutes before we receive our sandwiches. On top of that they were made wrong (after what the screen said was correct) So we ask for a manager. He was polite and apologized that he was training a whole new crew tonight. Which I can understand our food taking 15 min when you're training someone although I saw no said training taking place in the kitchen and that does not explain why our sandwiches were made wrong nor were they hot. You just have to know how to read...it's not rocket science. I have worked in the door industry for my entire life so I know how it goes. The manger did offer us 2 coupons for free munchies and free drink....whoooo-freaking-hooo! When you spend $25 on 2 sandwiches and a drink I except to have them made correctly and he hot!

    "text": "I've been criticized for rating too many places 5 stars, and I rebut: that's because I don't eat at crappy places.  You think you are a food snob?  Pah.  You are nothing in your snobbery.  I am an everything snob, so when it comes to food, which is what I do best, all of my other practiced, routine snobbiness comes flooding to the fore.  This makes me the best ever decider of whether or not something is tasty.  You, whoever you may be, are not.  I'm sorry, but there has to be a best of everything, and I am best at this.  So to those of you who have not given cheba hut five stars, there are only three possibilities: either you visited them on an off day, you didn't try the east coastern (pastrami with mozzarella, mustard, pepperoncinis, toasted on garlic sub roll with everything--mayo, vinegar and oil, black olives, pickle, parmesan cheese, oregano, and probably a little love), or you know nothing at all about food.  The place needs cleaning, I admit.  But that is the theme.  And while I find it funny that an entire restaurant can be themed after all things stoner, replete with more euphemisms than you could ever dream of for weed, it neither adds to nor detracts from my rating or overall opinion of the place.  No, the subs here are sensational, made with just the right amount of everything all heaped on to whichever bread you choose.  Maybe you aren't creative enough for cheba hut.  Maybe you just don't really see what it's all about.  I can't tell you if that is or isn't True.  But what I can say is that if you don't think the food here is great, you're wrong.  I'm sorry.",

The Kail Mist, the krispy treats, the kool-aid all combine for the perfect mix whether you have THE munchies or just the munchies ;) Only thing I'm not a huge fan of is how some employees seem to abuse the casual, kick back kind of attire to where it looks like they seriously just rolled out of bed without, at the least, a body shower. Other than that I'll continue being a repeat!",

I love my subs, and feel that my highly sensitive taste buds shall only be graced with the tastiest, bestest subs on the planet.  I have a long resume of subs under my belt, and know a good sub when I taste it.  Cheba hut isn't bad.  Its just not good.  as good as I wanted them to be.  I had excedingly high expectations for this joint, and was somewhat dissapointed once I sunk my teeth into the sub.  It lacked something...luster maybe, Im not sure, but it just didnt do it for me.  This place is okay.  It has a marijuana themed style thing going for itself.  Not so much hippie, but lots of pot references.  For starters, I dont think that the pot theme is really appropriate for children.  How do you explain this to a child?  Not a family friendly place for anyone of a youthful age (aka small children.)  So, thats a strike.  I  dont think that I would take school age children here just for that.  BUT, the staff was immensly friendly with me.  Service was AMAZING.  The guy at the register was friendly, outgoing, and actually introduced me to the staff.  I felt super relaxed and comfortable when ordering, and eating here.  I love friendly service.  The girl who built my sub was awesome as well.  She made personal conversation with me, and I liked that.  The sub itself lacked meat.  I wanted more meat (stop laughing) and it was short on that.   The food here is okay.  I feel like its more theme then a sub that could light my tastebuds up in flames.  I would probably go here again, but not under the pretense of eating amazing food.",

It was kind of pricey, for 2 subs, 2 drinks, chips and a treat almost 20.  They place could be also a little cleaner.   I wouldn't drive more than 2 miles to go there and I wouldn't crave it either.   If you're in the neighborhood, it might worth a try. If i would live around, I would order delivery service once in a while, though. Their statement: \"If you're high, we'll fly\"",

I order the pinner (I believe that's what it's called) and couldn't finish it. My mate ordered the blunt size and we wasted a whole half of sub. It was just wayyyyy too big and whichever sandwich he ordered had NBQ sauce on it, a lot of it so if you don't eat it almost immediately you'll be left with soggy bread! He also ordered extra meat on his sandwich and I understand why. I'm so sorry I can't remember the names of the subs but I ordered what would be equivalent to an Italian sub. The flavors were so dern good but the meat?? Idk where it went lol  I'd definitely order it again but with extra meat. My sandwich reminded me of a potbelly sandwich honestly. The next time I visit I'll be sure to get an original sandwich of some sort.   The cookies!! Holy moly!! The cookies are insanely good. We ordered one cookie to share while we were waiting for our food, after eating that one cookie we ordered 2 more to take home!!",

Sometimes, I don't get the stuff I paid extra for or they don't add a lot of the stuff listed on the menu that the sandwich or salad comes with. One time, I ordered a Kali Mist sandwich with everything on it. However, I just got turkey, green peppers, tomatoes, pickles, and a bucketful of sauce. My sandwich was swimming in it. How do you mistake green pepper as jalapeno? I was missing avocado and bacon and the extras. I also got a salad one time and clearly said no cheese because I am lactose intolerant, but I got cheese. It was also missing stuff it should come with or I paid extra for. I also never get my croutons on my salad, except one time. It was a major disappointment each time.",

Now be aware the decor and the display, is not kids appropriate and yes my kid did ask about it which is fine, you can't really hide reality anymore lol.

So I ordered a salad and left a nice tip in the tip jar for them finally telling me that the bread is not vegan. This came as such a surprise because I've been asked before if I was vegan and have told them I'm vegan.   The salad that I received had VERY little toppings and was missing some that I ordered, also it came with croutons made with the non-vegan bread. The dressing that came with the salad was basically flavorless oil which completely covered any of the flavor of the salad.   The shift lead, who was understanding and apologetic, asked if I'd like the salad remade and I declined. And I'm glad I did.   As my party and I were leaving the entire kitchen staff was having a seemingly good time at the expense of my poor experience. One of the missing toppings for my salad was hummus which one employee had said \"he should be happy we forgot the hummus, it's not vegan either\"   Pretty disheartening coming from the Cheba Hut crew.   I did not want anything in return for my poor experience I simply wanted to inform the staff of the mistake. Now you can hear of their mistake.",

All of their homemade sauces are delicious and the bread is so crunchy! I recommend getting the Midwests Best or the Thai Stick. Oh and whoever created the Goo Balls is a god. Those things taste like pancakes, cocoa crispies, waffles, and a peanut butter & honey sandwich, ALL IN ONE GOOEY BALL!",

Took my favorite sandwich off the menu and rearranged everything on the menu so I suddenly found myself scanning to find a different vegetarian sub to choose from with a snarky little cashier in front of me giving me attitude while I tried to make up my mind quickly. Not pleasant. I normally tip, but not this time. I got the bill and figured out that Cheba raised their prices. Didn't realize that the bill was also high because the cashier rang me up for a 12\" when I asked for an 8\". And when I tried to put ice in my cup for a soda, nothing would come out but slush. Never going back! As if it's not hard enough to find decent vegetarian food, they took two of those sandwiches off the menu AND raised prices. Done with them.",

I'd tell you what my favorite sub on the menu is, but all that would end with is me giving you a link to their menu. It's ALL good, even the vegetarian stuff (and I don't usually LIKE vegetarian subs).  And then there are the munchies. Oh god, the munchies are awesome. I'm personally a fan of their goo balls (a giant ball of PB covered rice krispies with cocoa and honey) and their hemp brownies.   On top of that, everyone who works there is pretty much made of win.",

This sub shop is anything but ordinary, the first thing you'll notice is the laid back feel, the great music, and the awesome decor. The staff are also way cool, as well as the crowd,  it's a cool place to people watch. Even the sub sizes are extraordinary, you may pick from the following : Nug (4' ), Pinner ( 8'), or if you've got the extra munchies go with The blunt (12').   To add to it's uniqueness all the subs carry the various names of the lovely lady Mary Jane. They also have quite the collection of no meat subs for our veggie friends out there, I'd personally recommend the Griefo. It's a garden veggie sub with guac, mushrooms, and cheba huts very own creation : hemp cream cheese. If you like a little more meat on your sub try The Kind (turkey, bacon, swiss, and mushroom) or The Pakalolo (ham, swiss, and pineapple). These are personal faves of mine.   Lastly, they have lots of tasty treats to pair with your meal, such as brownies (hemp is great!), goo balls, rice krispie bars, ect.   So next time your down by MCC, just look for the bright green VW bus and you'll find Cheba hut: Home of  The Blunts !",

    "text": "Cheba Hut was one of those \"must go to\" places on my list for when I moved back to AZ. Unfortunately it took me over a year to get there. I had a hankerin' for a sandwich last week so I decided to venture to my least favorite part of Mesa to see if it was how I remembered.  I have to say that the whole ordering system is way more streamlined than it used to be. No more walking down the line while the person behind the counter asks if you want every condiment imaginable on your sandwich. You wait in a line to order while looking at the large menu posted on the wall, and when you get to the register the guy ringing you up asks what you want on it and rings you up accordingly. You pay and they bring it out to you. Instead of giving you a number, they give you a picture or character from a movie. Cute.  I ordered the Jamaican Red with hemp cream cheese. One of my favorites from the past. When I ordered, the guy ringing me up let me know it was an extra charge for the cream cheese. Thank you! It was just as I remembered. Buffalo chicken, olives, jalapenos, cream cheese....and toasted?!?! Yum!! I'm salivating just thinking of it now. They have an excellent selection of other sandwiches, salads, and treats. I didn't get one on this trip, but the rice krispee treats here are the best I've ever had (besides homemade). Back in the day I used to get the southwest chicken salad, also known as the AZ Homegrown. It was my #1 but it's not on the menu anymore. Curious if the White Widow replaced it? Maybe I'll give that a try next.  This location has some seating so even when crowded you can most likely get a table or pull up a stool along the window. My meal came to just under $12. Ouch! Although a little higher in price than what I like to spend on lunch, it won't deter me from going back.",

    "text": "This is my go-to comfort food spot. One of the best places to check out when you get a craving, 420 or otherwise, for a seriously good toasted sub sandwich.  The sub menu is pretty extensive and offers a wide range of culinary delight. From the AK-47 Roast Beef served au jus; to the crunchy veggie offerings that have serious flavor and satisfaction.  Check out the munchie bowl! Want to get away from a bag of commercially acceptable chips? Check out the killer rice crispy squares and cereal balls, that will keep you happily munching and crunching.  It follows a quirky \"Cheech & Chong\" motif throughout the restaurant. Which is awesome as it caters to the college crowd. (I wish a Cheba Hut was around when I was in college.)  They even have an authentic, homemade, Tiki Hut tucked into the corner that serves up ice cold craft beer that will take you beyond the beaten path.   $THREE DOLLAR BEERS$ ALLDAY FRIDAY!!!!  For you Koolaide noodle heads, they give you the choice of a few flavors you can get right out of the tap next to the soda machine.  Awesome spot, attentive, yet laid back staff that knows how to get the job done and remain smiling while doing it... Hmmm, wonder if that's part of the motif?  So, all and all, The Cheba Hut... Rocks!  RECOMENDED!",

Food is at a wonderful price, especially considering the quality - you can get your grub on and not break the bank. If you go, you should really get a White Widow, grape Kool-aid, and a cereal bar. It'll fuck you up in the best way possible. So good.   The service is what really closed the 5-star review for me. After my friends and I ordered, we all noted how friendly, warm, and professional the man taking our order was. I was with a bunch of friends once and my pretzel bites were taking a while to come out - I wasn't upset, didn't complain, didn't say anything... but when my food came out, the gentleman who took my order apologized and gave me some coupons for the wait. It was a very proactive thing to do and really solidified the quality of service the staff provided. Ever get customer service so good it makes you misty? Yeah.

I love their pakalolo and their Greek Chicken. I can't say enough good things about this place and recommend it to family and friends who are in the mood for subs.",

I have been visiting this location for over a year now and have yet to be let down by the food or service. I highly recommend Cheba Hut.   If you like sweet treats, try their unique rice Krispy treats made with different cereals. They are amazing.",

    "text": "Toasted is what we have in this place and it is pretty tasty. Hippie kind of vibe going on here. Bob Marley, Jimi Hendrix, psychedelic wall art, Kool aid and lots of other references to being high ... on life of course.  Cool music playing outside as you walk up to the door. Inside gets even cooler (109 degrees today outside). Nice!  I was welcomed immediately and told about the menu and what was good or popular. Some of the items on the menu are called by names you may have seen in a medical mary jane dispensary or on one of your favorite TV shows.  HUMBOLT, KUSH, TRAIN WRECK, ACAPULCO GOLD, JAMAICAN RED, THAI STICK, MAJIC MUSHROOM ... Too many to list them all.  Had to get Toasted with a Toasted Sub and went with the 12\" Blunt size Widow Maker. Did not think the Pinner size would be enough. Comes with Chicken breast smothered in their signature, home-grown ranch dressing, then topped with mushrooms, bacon & provolone cheese. You can mix or match toppings if you wish.  Service is super friendly and most accommodating. Menu also has other items like Salads, Soups, or something Sweet to finish things off. Just tell them what you want. Jah Man!",

Their signature garlic herb bread is insanely delicious and compliments their sandwiches perfectly. My daughter's love the Apollo 13 (think Greek) and the Kali Mist (California Club).

First of all, no one in the kitchen had on hair nets! Their hair might get be pulled back but many of them have long hair, which means there's a chance hair might get in the food! Ugh!!   Second, I order a sandwich and it had only one, paper-thin piece of bacon on it. The description made it sound like the bacon would a tad-bit more plentiful than a measly ole piece of bacon that was thin enough to see through!   Third, the sandwich was even that great! In fact, I found it quite bland, borderline nasty! I'm not sure if you have to be high in order to enjoy the food or not! Perhaps that might give the food more flavor!   Fourth, everybody's day knows Koolaid should be sweet and full of flavor! Even that was flavorless!  #disappointed #WontBeGoingBack",

The sandwich creators were very fast at getting the orders out especially because they had the lunch hour rush. Anyhow some how my sandwich was not in any of the bags. So I called to ask if it was still there. They apologized and made me a new one to go pick up. I got there they had my sandwich ready and they gave me 2 cards for free munchies. I thought this was awesome of them to do and really listened and took care of the problem instead of making it into a bad situation.   This is why we will keep returning GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE and AMAZING FOOD",

The atmosphere is a tad out of my element - the whole stoners' laidback type of place, but don't worry, I have yet to come across a snobby or uptight stoner in this place . They're friendly, I promise you. You might even get asked to join a game of beer pong by a stranger - like I did.   Oh yeah, there is a sidebar in the place - they have local brews and your run of the mill brews. I haven't sat at their bar yet, it's usually already occupied by the locals by the time I get there (around 9pm).",

    "text": "I was craving a sub sandwich at around 8pm after my husband got out of work, while most places are closed for the day Cheba Hut remains open until the wee hours of the night lol  Was not initially a fan of the white widdow, waaayyy too much ranch dressing for me personally, ate half and saved the rest for the next day, after the bread soaked up the excess dressing the sub was actually quite good.   My fav and my husband's as well is the 5-0, a little spicy since they add bits of jalapenos but I like that.   The AK aka french dip, the dipping broth was heavily salted and tasted more like a half cup of water mixed with a heaping serving of generic beef bullion. It was a hard pass for us.   The kool-aid fountain drinks were a delightful suprise?   Sign up with your phone number to receive special offers, the offers will be automatically prompted on screen next time you come in.

    "text": "This is one of my favorite sandwich shops.  I have a standing Friday lunch with a coworker and we come here 80% of the time.  I get the same thing every time.  Call me boring, but it is the perfect sandwich.  The Kali Mist is turkey topped with pepperjack cheese, bacon, avocado, diced jalapenos, and chipotle dressing on white bread.  I don't know where they get their bread for certain, but I think it is a magical land of crispy, chewy delightfulness.  They offer other toppings, but who needs vegetables?  Cheba recently added a bar with beer on tap and offer an all day HH on Fridays.  Delivery is available through a phone app, but it takes an hour to get your food.  While still delicious when delivered, it is much better eaten fresh in the restaurant itself.  The stoner theme is the best and they always have a movie on so you can watch as you eat (you won't want to talk once you start eating these sandwiches).",

The cashiers always make sure they get your order right, and they have never failed to get me exactly what I've ordered. This is a breath of fresh air because as a picky eater, I usually remove or add items to standard menu items. That being said, I'm used to having my order arrive incorrect. But not at Cheebz! The subs are always freshly toasted, and the ingredients are fresh as well. This place has literally the best subs I've ever had.  I most recently went there after the ASU vs. Stanford game, and was pleasantly surprised to see they served quality beer as well. The reason this location gets 4 stars out of 5 as compared to the Tempe location off Hardy and University, is because this location doesn't server beer on draft! Hey, I can't give em' both 5 stars if the other location has one thing I like better.   Now I know the stoner culture vibe might be a little annoying or overwhelming to some, but you definitely don't need to be a stoner to eat here. I encourage anyone who enjoys sandwiches / subs to go to Cheba Hut!",

My last sandwich here was the pinner KGB, a roast beef sandwich with mushrooms, bell peppers, and Swiss with extra horseradish sauce plus the works (lettuce, tomato, onions, oil, vinegar, Parmesan cheese and oregano). Added some Pineapple Yerba Matte iced tea and I was super happy.

We came across this place, and I'm not sure what it is about it or what I had heard that made me not really want to go here....but I reluctantly agreed. Turns out, it is really and surprisingly good! I got the jamaican red which is chicken (and the chicken is like chunks of chicken breast, which is perfect for this kind of sandwich) some kind of spicy red seasoning/sauce, jalapenos, bell peppers, and cheese. It was really spicy and tasty. The BF got the Thai stick and it was also very good, but with more of a sweet flavor. I like that all of the sandwiches are toasted, and toasted for enough time that the bread is crunchy and everything inside is ooey gooey....a lot of other places can take note that this is like the definition of awesome when it comes to toasting a sandwich. We also got the garlic bread....it was good, very large for the money, but the sandwiches were a bit better.  I would come back here for a good cheap meal again.",

What I don't get is how many employees does it take to make two sandwiches when I came in there were 6 people behind the counter one behind the bar and roughly ten people in the joint. It took over 20 minutes to get 2 sandwiches to go and the sandwich was okay at best. The whole stoner vibe is fine except I have seen people under the Influence make a sandwich faster. I will just take my money to Ike's up the street next time its a little more expensive but it tastes better and they can figure out how to put meat in between two pieces of bread.",

Baffled at how I haven't written a review for them after all these years...must of slipped my mind haha  Sub sizes come in 4\", 8\", or 12\", AKA a nug, pinner, or blunt, respectively.  Each toasted sub is creatively named after, you guessed it, weed! My favorites are White Widow, Griefo (veggie only), and The Kind. I love seeing all of the novelty stickers, photos of past customers, and scribbled in messages on the counter--gives me nostalgic, warm, fuzzy feelings. The atmosphere is laid back.   Everyone that works here is super chill, and provide quick and friendly service. They also deliver, which I have used their delivery service without any issues. Their motto is \"if you're high, we'll fly, safety first!\" Wise words. This place is a fun spin on toasted subs \"where the only thing fried is an occasional customer\".   If you've driven by and saw there magical love bus parked outside and wondered if you should try, just do yourself a favor and experience the clever concept that is Cheba Hut. It's one of a kind!",

Hands down the very, extremely, most bestest sandwich I have ever eaten. We walked in and I took a glance at the menu. As the pickiest eater you've ever met, I have NEVER ordered directly from a menu as is. Well I did so here, I ordered the Greek Chicken sandwich on the garlic roll, and was beyond satisfied!!! I ordered the 8\", (which the gentleman helping told me kindly informed me that it was the \"medium\" size)....and I ate EVERY LAST BIT! I was so full, but I couldn't stop. I hate soggy bread, yet the best part of this sandwich was the soggy edges of that garlic bread drenched in Greek dressing!!!! Eat this!!!! You won't regret it, can't wait to try the next sandwich they recommended!!!",

Their menu consists of sandwiches and salads. I decided to try a sandwich called the Apollo 13. It was grilled chicken with salad greens, kalamata olives, feta cheese, and greek dressing. You get ur choice of type of bread and size of sandwich.  I expected the sandwich to be amazing but it wasn't. It was just ok. The chicken was not grilled properly-- not a char in sight. It needed that. The chicken needed more seasoning as well. I would not order it again. However, since they have so many options i will give them another try.",

The first time around, I had their jerk chicken sandwich (which was okay, and I didn't really care for it). During my recent visit, I got the BBQ chicken with double meat - the sandwich was loaded to the max! I was really impressed at how good it was. The chicken was completely tender (unlike the first time around) and moist and everything on the sandwich complemented each other. The bread was extremely crunchy to contrast the sauce in the chicken. They also have some creative twists on the regular Rice Krispies as they incorporate different cereals into the mix as well.  TBH, cheba hut is not my favorite stop for a sandwich, but it is better than most.",

I have twice ordered online or via phone from them to go to bring dinner home for my family and what we got wasn't exactly what we ordered.  So now I plan to only go when I'm eating in.  Their subs are delicious as are their salads.  I like the laid back atmosphere and they have funny things all over.  Like when u go to fill ur cup ur likely to see a pic of Ice Cube next to where u get ice or Iced T black for the unsweetened and yellow for the sweetened.  Their rewards are great!

    "text": "Okay, why doesn't this place exist in NORTHERN California of all places?! Come on... Bring Cheba Hut to NorCal!  This is a marijuana-themed sandwich joint. The sandwich names, sizes, etc make references to weed. There's a sign telling you that your sandwich isn't promised to take less than five minutes... (because stoners, lazy, work, joke, har har)  Theme aside, this place is great! They serve Kool-Aid and Tang at the fountain which is one of the greatest ideas ever. They also serve iced yerba mate alongside their regular iced tea, which I had a taste of (pretty good) but couldn't drink a full cup of since I wasn't allowed caffeine at the time.  The place markers they give you to recognize who you are and give you the correct sandwich are so different than other places - pictures of Nirvana, Wayne's World, etc... Despite the sign joking your sandwich would take a while, I actually received my sandwich like a minute or two after sitting down, even though the place was really busy. And it was amazing! Amazing enough for me to come back the next day too.  You can have hemp cream cheese (not sure what that entails), hemp brownies, goo balls (rice krispie treats made with honey, cocoa, and peanut butter), and you can even get your sandwich on garlic bread. That's a super stoner idea if I've ever seen one. I haven't tried any of these so now Cheba Hut needs to come to the bay area so I can do so, ok? ;)  Verdict: The decor is hilarious, the ambiance is great, there's various flavors of Kool-Aid, the service is quick, and the food is good. There's not much you can critique on that.",

I'm not a vegetarian but will order it from time to time. The Skunk (egg salad) is also pretty tasty.   They also have Tang for a drink option. How's that for a throwback? And for dessert don't forget to try one of their ooey gooey munchies. Get the Captain Crunch Krispys Treats if they have those.

They do not skimp on toppings and got the order to perfection. Thick cuts of meat in our sandwich , fluffy fresh bread and crisp vegetables. It really was delicious. Everything was fresh and hearty, just what you'd expect the perfect sandwich to be. My family is still raving about this sandwich place.   I have to also mention the exceptional customer service. The employees are friendly, knowledgeable and will even make awesome suggestions for a killer sandwich. Inside  of the restaurant is clean, well maintained and very comfortable atmosphere.   My wife was in the hospital and at the time, nothing seemed appetizing to her till she tried a sandwich from Cheeba Hut. She was absolutely thrilled",

They have a good menu selection, and needless to say, they make a damn fine sub!! I've tried their white widow during my pre-Yelp days, so no pics to show--shame on me!! I was very sheltered. Blame my parents! Lol i had their Panama red (pictured) twice now & love that it's simple, yet sooo tasty!!

I called in immediately to let them know we don't live close and explained what is missing. They put me on hold and got the manager. He said he couldn't verify I was telling the truth and would need the sandwich brought in to verify. I offered to send a picture to him and he said he couldn't do it. I advised him it would be insane to make up missing ingredients and would never just call to get a refund. When in reality I could just pick off ingredients and just walk in with this sandwich. It's silly to question someone calling in about their mistake. He stood his ground and I advised it would be insane to seriously get a bad review over something like this. He laughed and me, said he'd refund and hung up.   Ridiculous customer service and horrible sandwich. I cannot reiterate this enough. What kind of clientele do you service that you call a customer a liar about a mistake like this? Just incredibly dissatisfied.",

The cashier was very friendly and we had more then enough time to look over the pretty big menu. We ended up going for the white widow with all the toppings and we definitely had to make it a blunt size. (12in) We had already set our minds on sharing this gigantic sub so we opted for the 12inch. I also got a bag of chips and a small drink and my total was close to $14.  We sat down and waited a little more then 5 minutes. The same guy who rang us up brought over our sub to where we were seated. They were kind enough to cut our sub in two and put it in two different trays.   The white widow sub is so GOOD!! It had warm chicken, mushrooms, bacon, and it was covered in their ranch sauce. The bread was toasted and warm so it made it that much better!   There is plenty of seating and they also have an outside area. They have a bar area, and they also have different flavored look aids!   Give this place a try! The food is great and the employees are very friendly!",

I try to get something new each time I go and each sandwich I have tried has been really good. My favorite go to is the White Widow with BBQ sauce! I usually get a side with my sandwich. My favorites are pretzel bites and French Onion Soup which is always top notch!   If you're craving a sandwich don't waste your money or time going to subpar places like subway, jersey mikes or Jimmy Johns. Go to cheba hut, you won't be disappointed!!!",

The GrubHub driver was absolutely terrible it took forever to get our food somehow he couldn't find my house which I'm not sure how because my boyfriend ordered through grubhub earlier and there was no issues. But I also know that's out of Cheba Hut control. What I am upset about is there was absolutely no salad dressing for the salad that I ordered.   Really upsetting to eat a dry saled. Was not able to enjoy it whatsoever. Thank God though I had some dressing in my fridge. Not nearly as good as your guyses ranch dressing if i actually got it.",

I love that they have an 8\" sub, always ends up being just the right amount. Bread options come in: white, wheat, or garlic. Furthermore, if you're in the mood for something sweet post meal, there is delicious brownies and crunchy treats right by the cashier. Staff at this particular location were friendly and patient when ordering. Food was promptly made and brought out to the table quickly.

I came in with my dog just like I have in the past at other locations only to be taken aback by Trevor's behavior. Immediately telling me to leave, not even asking if he was a service animal, or suggesting their dog friendly patio. After informing him he was a service dog he told me to get \"proof\" when BY LAW, all he is allowed to ask is what service the dog provides. As I attempted to explain this he simply walked away from me leaving me mid-sentence. I was baffled that someone would behave like that in their work place. At no point was I rude to him. I would hate for any one else to deal with such an ill mannered person. Hopefully management has a talk with Trevor. Fortunately the other staff was EXTREMELY nice about the situation and totally made up for it. My sub was amazing as always!",

So pony up the extra $4 or whatever it is to get a reasonable amount of meat.  $12 sandwich and I'm still hungry kinda sucks.  Also, the staff is either stoned, retarded, or both.

One of the interesting things about cheba hut is that in addition to soda, they have kool aid to drink as well. Good kool aid too, not watery stuff.   Be aware that this restaurant is all based on weed references. All the sandwiches are named after different types of weed, a 12 inch sandwich is called a blunt, deserts are called munchies, etc.  I have been several times and it's always good and the staff are always really nice and helpful.",

I first went to the one on University and had a great experience. The one on Southern however, for some reason, really seems to short you on ingredients. Twice now I ordered two sandwiches and paid extra to add the hemp cream cheese to them. Both times now they have barely put any on there but still charged me $1.00+ for the addition. They were both delivery orders or perhaps I could have said something when I got them.   The part that really is frustrating, yesterday when I ordered the sandwiches, I said to the guy that last time it didn't look like there was much if any cream cheese on the sandwiches and asked if he could make sure it gets added.  The shop on University added a generous amount both times I have gone.  Otherwise I have no complaints. I will still give the other place on Southern a chance to redeem themselves... mainly because they deliver.",

Who knew my first exposure to drug slang would be in a sub shop.  I have to tell you drug references or not this place knows what they are doing.   Our sandwiches were awesome!  I definitely will be going back as this is, I know it already, my favorite sub shop.  If you get a chance check this place out you won't be disappointed.",

They have GIANT rice krispie treats for dessert.  They also have treats made with other stuff like fruity pebbles, golden grahams, cocoa pebbles, etc.  They also offer fountain drinks that include, but are not limited to:  grape kool-aid aka purple drink, and TANG.  I've been here a dozen times, the service and the food are consistently goood.",

But the subs are fantastic, almost as good as subs from back home in Jersey, almost.  The subs are fresh and stuffed with everything you want.  I've been here many times and the only negative is that the staff is sometimes a little slow.  But since I'm usually there after drinking (I'm not the DD), it doesn't bother me much.  I would recommend this place as a decent choice for late night fare, way ahead of going to Dennys.  It definitely is an adult friendly place, leave your brats in the trunk.",

Lord help me but I can't remember what it was called... On it was pulled pork, arugula and one of those purple leaved greens, cilantro, pickled onions, sriracha aoli, mayo, jalapeno... And probably cheese i dont know.  What I do know is that was the best damn pulled pork sammich I have ever had. I will have a fit if they don't put it on the menu permanent style.   -in love",

You need to study the menu a little bit, but if you need a little advice they're always really helpful.  They get pretty busy, so I can understand the cleanliness of the tables and chairs slipping here or there. But when you're walking to tables to serve, doesn't take a couple seconds to give it a quick wipe down.  I love Cheba Hut, certainly a lot better than the big name sub restaurants.",

I usually get veggie subs but this one sounded good so I figure I'd try it and it didn't disappoint.  The sub has chicken smothered in ranch on it along with melted provolone cheese, mushrooms, and bacon.  Definitely something to get again when we go back to this location.",

Alas, today was finally the day we decided to try this place. I chose the \"nug\" size (4 inch) white widow on wheat bread and my boyfriend got the \"pinner\" (8 inch) Kali Mist on the asiago Siracha bread (EXCUSE ME, there is heaven and it's called Cheba Hut). The cashier asked if we'd like our subs \"loaded up\" to which we said yes. Later we found out that meant lettuce, red onion, tomato, and a big pickle in a vinaigrette style dressing which really added some great flavors.   The style of this place reminds me of my boyfriend back when he was 16 when all he listened to punk music. The workers all had smiles on their faces, were joking with each other, and just gave the place an all around pleasant vibe to sit down and enjoy a meal at.  The drink selection was great - complete with different flavors of koolaid! What?! So awesome.  We received our subs and were so pleased with them. At first I didn't think the nug size would be enough to fill me up but it was perfect.  If you're having a hard time deciding if this place is worth trying, just go. It was way better than I expected it to be and I will be back!",

To start, the sizes of the sandwiches aren't simply listed in inches, but have a (strictly coincidental) name to identify them: Nugs (4'), Pinners (8\"), Blunts (12\").  The entertaining names don't stop there; here are a few of the sandwich names:  Kush Silver Haze Afghani Panama Red  This being our first visit, I went with the Afghani (thinly sliced spicy turkey breast, jalapenos & pepper jack cheese).  To mine I added black olives, lettuce, spicy mustard, and a little mayo; all on wheat bread (other options are garlic and white).  I got the Blunt, and it was more than enough to fill me up for what I feel was a reasonable price (under $10 if I remember correctly).  The bread and meat were very fresh.  The toppings were kept at according temps (olives cool, condiments just cooler than room temp, lettuce not soggy).  Overall a very pleasant experience.  Lastly, the first place I have been to in the Valley that gives me a chance to get a fountain Wild Cherry Pepsi.  The staff was friendly, entertaining \"stoner\" art (check out the Garden of Weeden mural), I would visit this place again.",

They even have spring mix lettuce instead of using iceberg!   The environment is great! Incredible music is always blasting from the speakers. You will hear Led Zeppelin followed by Jimi, and then a little DMB to keep you entertained while munching on your grub. And the staff is always friendly and genuine.

The rice krispies, tang and kool aid are the perfect compliment. If I smoked I would totally eat here all the time.  Actually I don't and I already do so there you go!

    "text": "Never have I ever experienced such shitty service but, I guess that is what you can expect when every employee is a stoner. I called ahead because I heard that they have really good soup bowls and I wanted to make sure that they had the soup I wanted before making a trip there. When I called, a guy answered the phone and said he had no idea if they had any soup and sounded completely confused by my question. He placed me on hold to check with another employee. I waited about 5 minutes and decided that I should just head that way because I had a feeling that I was going to be on hold a while the way it was already going. I literally walked in the door and was standing in line to order by the time the guy finally picked up the phone. I was on hold for 20 minutes! What kind of company keeps someone on hold for that amount of time for any reason. He then told me that they did not have any more soup and they didn't plan on making anymore tonight. I confronted them about how awful the service was and told them that I would never be going back again and instead of saying sorry or even offering a different alternative he just said \" we were busy so I wasn't able to check until now.\" I would not advice anyone to eat here unless you don't mind being blown off as a customer and being waited on by people who honestly don't seem to care about good customer service. I for one know that I will NEVER be going back and I will let anyone who asks about this place that it is not worth your time or money.",

    "text": "I finally got a chance to try Cheba Hut after hearing rave reviews about it from several friends. I think my expectations were too high. It was good, but it wasn't GREAT. The toasted subs are comparable to those that you would get at Quiznos but with some more interesting and innovative options. It was almost $20 for two 8\" subs, one fountain drink, and one dessert. The food is basically fast food, and those are not fast food prices. I might go back again, but probably not soon.",

True to their name, they had a lot of theme decorations and quirky posters.  I ended up trying a The Kind pinner. Turkey, swiss, bacon, and mushroom on wheat. It was delish! There's something about the bread that brings everything together.   I'll have to try their garlic \"herb\" bread next time :)",

I look forward to a \"Griefo\" so much, that like Pavlov's dogs I start to salivate when I pull into the parking lot! I've gotten to know some of the employees that work there, and am impressed by the kindness they show their customers, as well as their work ethic. Every sub is made fresh, and they always remember that I don't like black olives!",

Whenever I go to the actual location, I hesitate to customize anything on it because they usually forget it. Whenever I order delivery they take a least an hour and half to  deliver a sandwich. And today, we decided to pick it up instead in hopes that it would help. And when we got there, 5 minutes after the scheduled time for pick up, we had to wait another 20 minutes to get two sandwiches. Your food can be good, but if your service is terrible you lose customers. And that's what happened today.",

    "text": "Man what happened to the bombtastic White Widow I remember back in the day? I had been craving Cheba Hut for a long time and while back in AZ I revisited the OG Cheba Hut from my high school days. Back in the day they had a gong (yes a real gong...well it was a mini gong, but a gong nonetheless) that you could ring on your way out to signify your happiness with you food and your visit. We would ring the shit out of that gong because the subs were so damn delicious. This time around it was a different story. They creamy spicy ranch dressing that use to accompany the White Widow has been replaced with a runny generic ranch dressing. :( The bacon looked like microwave bacon and was kinda rubbery. Has it always been this way? Have my taste buds changed that much? Does this change in my opinion have anything to do with my current level of soberness? Either way the goo ball made up for what the white widow lacked. I also wasn't thrilled with the fact that you don't follow your sandwich down the line anymore. I'll give the hut another chance but I must say I was disappointed this time around.",
