My cohorts say the pizza is good, but hey bar food is not my forte as a foodie. Hence, one star short because I have not eaten here.  I highly recommend if you are in the Ohio camp because this place is nuts on Saturday for the games. Everyone is having fun and the energy will make you break out in the school anthem! And there's bound to be some shot special being induced from a play or touchdown. Score!!! Sundays another good time to stop back for football, beers and more testosterone. Being a wingman makes me subject to this often and well, I'm a team player. The layout is perfect for playing hide and seek if you need to escape pesky inebriated men. As with any bar and being a woman I have to note that the bathroom is tucked in the back with limited stalls. I personally think it's a tactic for window shopping the patrons.   If you come to wreak havoc when the sunsets, the music will tempt you to take those sexy stilettos out until you burned enough calories to call it a night. Take pictures because even the best filters will never capture the kind of fun you are having.",

    "text": "Much like its sister bars, Hi Fi and Mint, Bottled Blonde does a nice job of combining an expansive outdoor patio with a more intimate restaurant setting inside. The outdoor bar is the clear focal point to this new Scottsdale hotspot that took the place of Axis/Radius. You'll find many places to sit including low tables with comfortable patio couches. A great choice for happy hour or weekend day drinks.  Their namesake house beer was this first I tried and could have guessed it was the delicious 5% Golden Blonde Ale from San Tan Brewery! Our server Katelyn, recommended the Magic Hat #9, which is a 5.1% pale-ish ale with a touch of apricot, maybe? It was pretty good and I was pleased to see some local beers including Four Peaks and Papago.   I ordered the Tartufo fries with a killer garlic Aioli sauce. The pepperoni pizza was also quite good and not your typical bar food. It's enough to split with a friend if you're also sharing an appetizer.   With TV's all around, I can easily see this place becoming just as popular as its neighbor bars. I really dig the sleek modern look, nice staff, and overall vibe. It's worth checking out nearly any time of day. Good work, Bottled Blonde.",

After I bought one drink and went to the bathroom, I realized the security guy followed me and watching me til I am done peeing. I were not even drunk at that time. He pointed at me and escorted me to the outside. In my whole life, I never got kicked out like this before without any explanations or something! I felt down and sad afterward then I went home! I were a happy guy and enjoyed my time off with friends and this big dude just observed me in the bathroom and kicked me out. This is freaking creepy as hell! I felt discriminated as a minority! I would never come back to this club ever again. If there a 0 star, I would be more than happy to give them 0 star! Goodbye and Never again!!! Please don't come to this club!

    "text": "Alright, so I've successfully came here both for the nightlife AND the Ohio-backer bar experience. I will attempt to review them separately.  Here is the short version for the nightlife version of the bar. Aesthetically nice. Very expensive drinks. Shit layout. Bouncers will knock you over like a linebacker if they need by to make way for bottle service, to silence a fight, or go get a girls number he's been eyeballing all night. Little to no place to sit or stand unless you have a table.  Here is the short version for the Ohio-backer version of the bar. Same expensive drinks. Nice HD TVs of the game EVERYWHERE. Shit-tons of Ohio Buckeye peeps. Absolutely nowhere to sit or stand unless you got there 3 hours before the game or reserved a table.  Long version for both the above. At night there are a ton of people packed in this place. Which is nice - nobody wants to be in an empty club on Friday or Saturday night. However, it is a legit, straight-up struggle to get anywhere in here... sober or drunk. The place is kind of separated into two bars - one bar kind of outside and the other is inside and lines the dance floor. To go between the two you have to wiggle through a door that is lined and packed with people. To go to the bathroom you at the very least have to struggle through the dance floor, if not through the door and the dance floor.   The music was good. I like to dance so I was happy to stay on the dance floor and avoid the door. However, I didn't start there and the few times I tried to \"walk a lap\" or go round up a lost friend it was pretty much, as we called it in the military \"nut to butt formation.\" The line around the place moved slow and so you were forced to hump the person in front of you and be humped by whoever was behind you. As you can imagine as the night goes on... and the alcohol has been flowing this can be interesting to give and receive. I don't really have a personal bubble (see previous comment about the military) so that didn't really bother me but I'd guess people that have a personal space bubble or claustrophobia might not like this. Oh, and if you don't like drinks spilled on you or knocked out of your hand while walking through, this also might nit be like you. In fact, now that I think about it... it was kind of running a gauntlet with 50 other people where everyone tries to knock you over or knock crap out of your hand as you pass.  This includes the bouncer at the door who feels the need to break up a fight with the other 18 bouncers at the rear of the bar... only he gets the magical authority to hit you like you are a tackle dummy on the ASU practice field. No apologies. Just wear your drink you lil bitch... and enjoy it.  That is a literal True story, BTW.  I have no idea how many times I saw, had friends, or experienced getting hit with drinks in my hand. It was like, cool, I got my drink... and someone would get a signal that they were required to barge down the aisle so that when you turned around they'd hit your drink. Again, no apologies. I also was standing by a table and some guy full force ran and tripped over a step (the tables are elevated) and seriously punched the drink out of my girlfriends hand and let the drink... and glass... rain down on the crowd like some rap video \"making it rain.\"  Again, no apologies... much less a \"oh shit, I spilled your drink... I'll buy you a new one.\" Good thing my girlfriend is a sport and I'm not a douche and I didn't knock him out.  In any case, it kind of reminds me of a frat party that is trying to be high-class. The place is nice but it turns into a disaster as the night goes on. People seem to have checked their manners at the door.  The other side of this place is that they are an Ohio State Buckeyes backer bar. Like, all the alumni go there... banner hanging outside and everything. Merchandise is sold at the door. This is supposedly one of the bigger Ohio backer bars in Phoenix. And if you don't know, there are a lot of us Buckeyes here in the valley... and yes, they are all there packed in when the Bucks play. But man, it is the same problem as the night story - no room and expensive. With games lasting 3 hours, who wants to stand there? Purely insane people and people with tables, that's who. No thanks for me. I love partying with my fellow Bucks but I like to have an inkling of comfort in doing it. So I went across the street to District and enjoyed the game there... and when Blonde did the songs and chants... I just did it from across the street. I wasn't the only Buck to do the same.  So what is the conclusion on all this? If you want to party... like you're in a frat and on a budget go to Giligins. If you want higher class then go to the District or Hi-Fi. Higher yet, then maybe Mint, Maya, or Cake? If you want to go to a backer bar then I find Buffalo Wild Wings on Gilbert/ Warner to be awesome as it has tables, prizes, and you will still have the same crazy Buckeye atmosphere.",

She was so appreciative of her customers and thankful for any amount of tip.  I can't speak to the friendliness of the bouncers because we arrived early before a line even started so there wasn't an issue, however all the staff inside the building was very nice. The security guards were just doing their jobs and overall were very considerate when walking through crowds and were apologetic when they had to get by.

This meant that we all had to leave. My friend did nothing. She was not being disruptive nor disorderly, she was just having fun as we all were. I hesitate to bring up the race card but I think it fits this situation. Saw security handling another situation prior to this but the people involved were not black. They didn't get removed from the club...  It is really unfortunate that things transpired as they did, my friend that was ejected actually recommended the club.

Because for some reason we had 2 different waiter wait on our table.. when they made us cash out obviously the other 2 waiters  didn't  get together to total up both bills..that was the only good thing that you screwed yourself out of $80 not a way to run a business..

The music was nice so were the customers, unfortunately there was a very rude bartender who I later found out was named Tolin. Soon as my friend and I entered the club he walked past my friend and I about 5 times without asking us if we needed anything. Not only did he walk by us, but he wasn't busy! He ignored us and served other customers while making us feel very uncomfortable. After being ignored by him, a wonderful black haired young lady helped us and made AMAZING DRINKS. I continued to watch Tolin and noticed he avoided all the black costumers. Figures. ",

When a giant street brawl broke out across the street (involving it seemed their own employees), naturally the whole bar pulled out their phones to Snapchat the scene.   Like some sort of meathead secret service, the bouncers came out of the woodworks to force everyone to put their phones away immediately. Strange request that people wouldn't be allowed to have their phones out at a patio bar in the middle of the day, but I complied because I don't care much for drama. I guess they were just trying to protect their employees and bar from internet embarrassment.   Nevertheless, I was promptly surrounded by multiple thug-like Bottled Blonde bouncers who forced me to leave. I had had about 3 sips of one beer at this point, and had politely complied with their ridiculous rules...At first they wouldn't let me get my credit card from the bar, until I threatened to call the police.   Video to follow for your enjoyment :)",

My brother, some friends, and I went a while back and it was a disaster. First, the music is terrible. Whenever picked it was perhaps new to the job, but he or she did not create a good vibe. Also, the staff's service is inconsistent. Some people were fine, but most, especially the bartender, were horrible. One of the bartenders spilled my brother's drink, re-made it, and then tried to double-charge him for it. That was just one of the ridiculous things that happened here. The management needs to step up and do a better job, because this is a less than run-of-the-mill club that nobody should go to. Better options anywhere else in Scottsdale.",

I've been several times and its always a mediocre experience, but this past visit this weekend was enough to make me never attend again.   The bartenders were attentive and helpful, but the behavior and attitudes from security cancels that out. I understand the stress the bouncers may be under, but maybe the bartenders and cocktail waitresses shouldn't over-serve the customers. In the time that we were there, more than three people were escorted out and were covered in vomit. It was so disgusting and the place smelled horrendous. Security was constantly yelling at us that we were not allowed to stand anywhere and one of the bouncers purposely shoved me while I was walking to the bar and yelled \"YOU NEED TO KEEP WALKING!\" which was grand since I was trying to navigate my way through the overly crowded bar.  It's unfortunate that the staff is so disgruntled, but it's not fair for them to treat the patrons that are behaving and trying to have a good time and not get obnoxiously drunk in such a hostile manner.",

I get it only young people who have their tuition paid by parents would go here, but we gave it a try and after standing in one spot and sipping on our drink we got escorted out. No explanation...nothing...when we asked for an explanation the guy just flashed the flashlight in our eyes and said good night...really?  It was just plain rude... Wow...there were three of us and one of us had zero to drink...I think we were escorted out due to the fact that we did not meet their age requirements I guess...if that was the case why were we let in the first place?  Why cause a huge scene that was not necessary?? And on top of it rude and un called for?  We were just looking for a spot after the concert to hang for a bit as I know there was other bars around,  but I guess this was not the spot.   I am really disappointed in the way the staff handled this and having people feel like they were profiled.  I guess if you don't fit the profile you get booted and that is what happened...I thought business was about money and tips from a customer but I guess they are above that.  We will spend our money elsewhere which is what we did...",

    "text": "Lets just say i am a very easy going & understanding person & it takes a lot to annoy me. Probably one of the worst experiences I have had at a place like this. I was visiting AZ last weekend, friends suggested I go here since its a new place in old town. Got there around 8.30 and after 25 mins of looking for table we found one. It took another 20 for someone to take our order (we ordered food & drinks). As we waited for our food  the rude bouncers came and asked us to get up and move to the next table, we did, then a few minutes later, they told us they needed the chairs we were sitting on, and they took those as well. At this point our table had been pushed completely In front of a hugeee fan, & we had no chairs. While standing around like fools & telling the bouncer had food coming,the bouncer said he would get us chairs & turn the fan off- it never happened. The next part is what ticked me off- the server brought our food and placed it right in front of the fan, allowing dirt & dust To be blown on it, not to mention the cheese on my pizza coagulated within seconds. 10 mins after the food was just laying around . At this point I refused to eat the food & continued to finish my drink & asked for the bill to pay for my drinks. This is quite funny, I get the bill and they had charged me for my the food as well. Not one apology, not one 'let me see if I can find a table'. The server was nice enough to bring us 2 free beers which I didn't even touch because I was soo annoyed. But overall it was an unpleasant experience.",

However for my halfway to thirty (okay fine, a little closer than halfway) self, I've just well...outgrown it. I would prefer a more mellow place that's not as crowded and loud (god, I can't believe I just said that!). BUT here's how I would party here going forward:  Rather than waiting until 10 or 11 at night, I suggest you roll in after work and grab some pizza, drink and stick around for when it starts getting clubby. By then, you'll have a good buzz going.   I know what you're thinking, \"Why the harsh two star rating when you've admitted that this place just wasn't your style?\" Here it goes: what really bugged me was that someone shoved my friend out of the way while we were there. I turned around to see what bitch pulled that move and to my extreme horror saw that she was sporting the red hot shorts uniform. IT WAS AN EMPLOYEE!!! WHAT? How rude is that? I mean, I get it, my friend was D-RUNK and probably in her way but still. I would have complained to a manager but seriously it takes a hundred years to flag down a bartender, I can only imagine how much longer it would be to find a manager.",

I had three premium draft beers, my husband had a vodka drink and the other couple we were with had 5 premium draft beers between the two of them. So it's not like we didn't order our fair share of food and drinks while we were there. We were just at the point we were slowing down.   We had a girl come to our table and tell us if we weren't ordering food we had to close out and give the table up. As we were leaving I overheard the managers looking over the table chart and said \"if people aren't ordering, the tables need to be turned over.\"    I give one star because they have a good beer selection but their practices are totally unethical. Won't ever go there again.",

We got bottle service and our table was close to the outside of the club facing the sidewalk. It was fun to people watch at the very least. They really don't try to keep the area you have clear, which is kind of ridiculous since you're paying for the table and the service isn't great. They bring by flashing lights when you get a new bottle then put a lock on top of it, so you can't pour your own drinks. I have clue how much drinks are or how much the bottles were, but overall, the club is nice and has a small dance area. They have  attendants in the bathroom, but that doesn't mean they're clean. They're pretty gross, actually. Maybe I'm too old for the clubs. haha",

That being said, we've been there a few times now and the staff was helpful and nice.  That is one thing I they do better than some of the other bars... the bartenders don't think their \"too cool\" for their customers.   A few other things to note:   1.  They do have games to play if you feel like doing something besides standing around and drinking.   2.  Decent music  3.  Their pizza looks really good... (Haven't tried it yet) 4.

Anyway my night started off like this, it was all four of us. During the night we order pizza and beer and stuff during the fight. Everyone was helping us left and right but did not spot out the waitress all night, i guess she was serving as well. Before the fight ended the bouncer had told us to leave the table, I told him that the fight was not even over and that I still had food on the table. He did not care at all, he told us that the table was reception for some one else..... I was like you should of told us that a long time ago instead of me ordering this food now I'm not going to eat it standing ..... He did not seem to care, as soon as the fight was over the guys took everything, including my beer that was not even finished.. I told the waiter right away what had happen.. She replace my beer right away.... At this moment i was already frustrated and annoyed and angry... Such and      embarrassment...  .. The fight had ended and i was just standing enjoying my beer, when it was time to check out I decided to not give any tips, WHY ..... they took my food, they kicked us out of the table, and left us standing like dogs in the corner. So my friend left her 2 dollars, I was like they don't even deserve a firkin penny! The waiter came back and asked me as there anything wrong with my service? I said yes so I explain everything to her it seem like she  did not care. She said that was not part of her service.  She said well I don't want your 2 dollars.She threw them on the table where I was leaning against.. After 30 Min's I decided to leave and never go back to that bar in my life... its been a year...",

We hunted down the manager, who was far more polite and he explained they had a formula for their pricing based on the bottle price (which was $70 at total wine).

Thank you Luke - amazing bartender & all around awesome dude!    I pretty much come here to say what's up to Luke and hope that no one gets sick or starts a fight around me lol which is happening everywhere in here ... So I usually post-up by the bar near where Luke is stationed.  I would recommend it if you want to get hammered out of your mind, act like an ass, and enjoy lots of drunkards stepping on your shoes!",

I went here with 9 friends during a bachelor party weekend, and two of them got kicked out for \"being too drunk.\" None of us had drank all night, and they were kicked out within 10 minutes. After overhearing some people talking, I learned this was common practice for the bouncers to kick out the \"less attractive\" looking people to keep up the Snobsdale reputation. I'm not sure who's criteria this stems from - the bouncers or the bartenders? Also, this place is notorious for thieves stealing cell phones from purses, since it's an easy getaway to hop the short brick wall with the open windows. Also, there's an underage prostitute who frequents here and always gets kicked out, lol. At least the bouncers do their job in this scenario.",

    "text": "Partying at the Bottled Blonde made me feel young again.  Writing about it right now? Nothing makes me feel older.  Turning onto East Indian Plaza, I thought we'd stumbled onto the Las Vegas Strip as opposed to a downtown block in one of the top retirement cities in the country. It was - as the kids would say these days - lit.  (Spoiler alert: more embarrassing millennial lingo to follow.)   Maybe I just don't get out much anymore, but the people-watching here was the real-life equivalent to scrolling through the Explore page on Instagram. Not sure what I mean? Is that because your page is full of cute puppies and Bible quotes? Because most dudes here, their pages are definitely semi-naked IG models and dank memes. But let's be honest, it's mostly the IG models. The ones with the tight dresses, and high heels, and butt cleavage, boob cleavage, cleavage cleavage, and daddy issues, and guys from Dubai sliding into their DMs. In a nutshell, that's the clientele at Bottled Blonde - done-up party girls craving attention and a bunch of bros definitely giving it to them.  I report all of this from the safety of a roped-off VIP, where a group of us had bottle service, couches, space to dance, our own scantily clad waitress, and all the energy drinks our hyper-beating hearts desired. Basically, not like those other bro guys I mentioned at all.  But once we ventured past the ropes, the Bottled Blonde was essentially bedlam. Watching girls taking Snapchat videos while twerking on one another is amusing enough from the sidelines, but walking straight through a sea of that shit is a bit too real. There's a back wall by the bathrooms that might as well be bleachers full of sweaty bodies pouring out onto the dance floor. Should I have been a patron at this bar solely in the general standing room only area vs. our VIP table, I admit I may not have lasted very long here.  But instead, I had a blast. Sure, in hindsight, it's easy to be judgmental and dismissive and above it all. But in the moment, I embraced the cheesiness wholeheartedly and very drunkenly. That counts for something.  Bottled Blonde bills itself as a pizzeria-slash-beer garden. I didn't see any of that. I saw an indoor-outdoor, industrial club disguised as a bar and grill. The TVs were a steady stream of neon logos and blacklit bikini girls, and the music, a mix of EDM and the worst guest verses from otherwise half-decent, hip-hop songs. But with a bunch of Rockstar and vodkas in my system, I wasn't really sweating it.   Well, that and the dry desert heat helped. Great for perspiration control.",

    "text": "Very disappointed with my visit today for brunch. My husband and I regularly go to RnR in Scottsdale for Sunday brunch and are given great service, never a problem. To our surprise RnR is under renovation, so we were golf cart shuttles over to bottled blonde. Upon arrival we were told we'd have to wait for a table and we could start bottomless mimosas at the bar (we were waiting on 2 other friends). We started bottomless mimosas and then I got a text our table was ready, the bartender rang us up for $66 dollars....... she said if we get brunch our server will take $20 off the bill (which makes sense, it's advertised as $30 for breakfast and bottomless). The host had informed us that another party didn't want the seat in the sun so that table was open. We sat, waited a good 12 minutes until our server arrived and ordered food because our friends were running late and we were hungry. A blonde hostess came up to us and asked when our friends were going to be there because she wanted to give our table to a bigger party and move us to the bar? Kind of rude, but I politely smiled and said no thank you. Our food came out, my order was wrong so they took it back and she ordered me the right plate... my husband also couldn't start eating his food because he didn't have silverware! The servers and managers walked by at least 12 times, not noticing that he hadn't touched his food, before I had to ask for it for myself from a manager. He didn't show much sympathy and his recovery plan was offering to buy is a round of shots. Also after paying for bottomless, you'd think they'd be more on top of refills. My husbands empty glass was taken by security multiple times and he had to ask a new drink... we had to ask multiple servers walking by if we could have refills. And the cherry on top was $20 actually wasn't taken off of our bill so between the two of us, the grand total was $89 for breakfast . Unfriendly servers, unapologetic managers and not worth the price. Won't be returning.",

I love bottled blonde I send a lot of people here but after last night I will be staying away for a really long time.  When I was at el hefe last night I went to wash my hands and was pushed out of the way by a very drunk girl. I told her to watch herself and to stop being a bitch because I needed to wash my hands. After that my friends and I left and went to bottled blonde. We had a fun time spent about $80 and we were dancing and hanging out.  We had to pee so we went into the bathroom. The girl that was at hefe was also in the bathroom and told security that I was threatening her at bottled (dude I already forgot about you and whatever happened) my friend told me to stay in the bathroom and not freak out and to wait for her to come out. I am pulling up my fucking skirt and security grabs me and holds me against them. I was still not fully dressed. I felt violated and harassed. I have a bunch of bruises and a weird blister on my finger from them punching me. I've never been so upset and felt so violated after what happened. I will be sending no one here any longer and I'm so sad about what happened. I've known bottled to have very racist security as well so be careful if you're not white coming in here. Attached are two photos of my arm with bruising and scratches. My other arm won't show bruising because of my tattoos.",

Fast forward we were not even finished with our meal and the security came to our table and said that we had to get up because it was a certain time and the table needed to be removed due to fire standards we were in the middle of eating.  we had a party of 8 people spent well over $1000.

She brings us our drinks after another 15 mins, granted they were busy. After a few sips, the doouchebag army of bouncers comes 1 by 1 to each table telling everyone they have to get up because they are getting rid of the tables and chairs to make room for more people to be able to chill and drink. Then they come to us and tell us to get up, i tell them we just ordered food, guy says fine u still gotta get up and we will place u at the next table. The roided up doouchehoves a table in front of a giant 7 foot diamater fan that was blowing super hard. I wish i took a picture to show, but it was ridiculous.  so we got up and refused to sit down 2 feet in front of this tornado. So we get up, some random guy drops off the pizza and calamari at the table and we arent even sitting there. Waitress comes by and we tell her this is BS we already tried cancelling the order, we were forced to get up. Then she brings us our bill and it has the food on there. What kind of service is this? She brought us 2 free beers to make up for the rude treatment we got from the dbag army, not being able to eat our food....but she still expected us to pay for the food. At that moment i got really mad and i said, no way we are paying for thus, left $15 for the 2 drinks and we left.

Employees need to learn manners or not be so biased as who they choose to be nice too. Also, I asked a security guard if I could use the restroom and I would leave something behind so he would know I came back & he said no. That's fine..but then I see multiple people being let in after that. Overall 0/10 experience.",

After having a terrible night at maya on Tuesday I figured it was worth the 5 star review on bottled since I was able to compare the different types of service experienced. Bottled blondes service is ALWAYS on point, no matter how busy they are. The bottle service girls are always so kind and make sure they tend to whatever it is you need. I'm sure working in an environment with a bunch of drunk individuals can be stressful but bottled always keeps up and makes sure you're getting the most for your bottle service. Super impressed and one of the only bars I've religiously gone to for quite some time now!",

A great friend of mine, perhaps the most handsome and well dressed among us, was turned away from entry  because of his \"white basketball shoes\", but most likely because he is black and not female. I then watched many white men get in with very similar white shoes get in without a hitch. When approached, the bouncer said \"I don't own the club, I wish it was different, but I just follow the rules.\" Glad your \"rules\" are racist. NEVER give them business!!!",

DO NOT GIVE THESE GUYS YOUR BUSINESS. He even said, \"You better get out of my F***ing face!\" as I was walking between him and my friend when he was literally pushing her to the exit.

The bouncer said that I was no longer ever allowed in because I was too intoxicated the weekend prior AND tried to knock his cell phone out of his hand. I was greeted with hostility and disrespect for actions I never did.   Needless to say, I do not think the bouncers should have a final say on whether or not I'm not allowed in and spend money with you guys.  Unless this matter is resolved, Bottled Blondes will be missing our business, not just mine. No more tables, no more invites from out of state guest, no more good clean fun in an establishment I stood by for the last 7 years. I would like nothing more than to get this resolved in an ethical and professional manner. Feel free to contact me so we can get this fixed the right way.",

On top of that, the bar is an \"outdoor\" bar so there were smokers galore blowing smoke in our faces :( bleccchhhh.  We requested to move to a different spot because of the smokers, and I will give credit to the bar bc they were happy to oblige.  EXCEPT when we moved, our new spot had even MORE smokers!

We wanted to take them out to experience old town, and one of our favorite places, Bottled Blonde.   My boyfriend decided to be DD for the night, and while he was standing at the bar buying everyone rounds of drinks, he was approached and asked to leave because he was too intoxicated. Mind you he had 1 beer about 3 hours prior. We actually had to talk security out of kicking us out and prove that my boyfriend was in fact not intoxicated whatsoever because he WASNT drinking. Moments later, security came and grabbed him and told us we needed to leave because he was \"too drunk\", they were extremely rude and aggressive and we had not done a single thing to deserve getting kicked out. Some of us were actually just dancing and my boyfriend was sitting down on his phone with his friend, once he stood up is when he was taken away. No manager or security guard gave us any explanation or let us explain that my boyfriend in fact was not even drinking. We were having such a good time and spending money, but unfortunately that was our friends' first experience of Bottled Blonde in old town and we will not be back. It ruined our night. Disgusted in the way this place is run and how they treated us is a complete understatement.",

One guy told me it was a 6 bottle minimum! 6 bottles for 6 guys!? If I had that much hard alcohol i would die! This place should be shut down for attempted murder! Sounds like everyone is trying to hustle you. Felt like I was in Mexico. After turning down bottle service we decided to just wait in line and go in. We all got in except the last guy who was told he can't enter because he was wearing Timberland \"work boots\". I wouldn't call $300 black suede shoes work boots but ok. The clown at the door, wearing yoga pants, was letting dudes in with vans and sandals but he won't let a guy in with shoes worth more than his whole outfit? Hate to call it a racist move but he did single out the Lebanese guy. After we questioned him, he told he would let us in if we bought bottle service. Scam! Read through the reviews on here. Not hard to see the pattern here.",

Now that I'm older, I went there after years of not doing the whole \"old town\" scene,  and within 2 minutes of being there i walk to the bar, casually waiting for my drink, when security comes and tries to kick me out for being \"too drunk\". Myself and the girls I was with were so confused. I walk out with security and he goes \"clearly you're not too drunk but I'm just doing as I was told.\" .... coming from someone who has been going to bottled since they opened I can honestly say that this place is an embarrassment. If you want to feel violated by a bunch of 21 year olds (nobody older than that) , music that is too loud you can't even talk to the person next to you, and drinks that contain literally NO alcohol, go to bottled blonde.",

My girls and I show up at 9pm on the dot, and the hostess tells me that I don't have a reservation. She tells me reservations are only for people with \"bottle service\" and spending a minimum of $200. WTF? So WHY was I allowed to make a reservation in the first place?? The dense girl's response, \"I don't know.\" Obviously.  This is Scottsdale Arizona people. This is not Hollywood or Vegas. Get over yourselves! I was then painfully run into by some drunk dude and a drunk girl covered in glitter and possibly a bikini. Which means they are clearly over serving their patrons. :) We were outta there!  And in response to the comment left below from I am assuming a manager, it doesn't change the fact that you do not allow customers to sit down and enjoy themselves at a table without paying your establishment a minimum of $200. That is absurd. You advertise as a comfy, calm pizzeria type place, when really you are just typical Scottsdale. Over-hyped, over-sexed, over-priced and you value yourselves much higher than you deserve. Drink quality, food quality, and obvious customer service do NOT match your prices.",

Obviously, it being NYE I was expecting It to get packed, It was crowded, but not stifling so 90% of my time there, except up until about 11:45, I think they let a few too many people in, the floor by the far back bar area was WAY too crowded, I mean, completely. You couldn't even MOVE anywhere. People were trying to get to the bar, but it was just a bit too cramped. It was like trying to part the red sea at 12:30 when my friend and myself were attempting to leave.  Prior to that though, it was enjoyable. My 10$ jack and coke was a bit overpriced for what it was, the bar tender stacked it so full with ice, that I think it was gone in about 5 sips....a tad bit of a letdown for 10$ ha ha. However, I danced for a good two hours, have a blister on my toe from my heels, and had a nice time up until the complete sardine packing near the midnight countdown.  Did not try any of the food though, being that it was party night. The building is pretty cool. I enjoy the indoor\\outdoor vibe. Although, I'm not sure how that fares when it is 115degrees outside, they better have a darn good AC system. (; Plenty of TVs around for (I'm assuming) game nights and such. That night The bar-tender was fast and pleasant. Obviously did not strike up a conversation with him, but he noticed me and got my order quickly. The music selection was danceable and fun. Only 1 or 2 songs I couldn't stand (by personal preference, of course), otherwise it was all good in the hood for me that night. Made my NYE fun, especially on a ridiculously cold and rainy night!!",

I went in with a couple of friends to get drinks a few times, the hosts that were at the front were kinda snotty and stuck up, the guys at the bar didnt look like they were even interested in serving drinks to us or others. We decided to order food, and they werent too bad but like i said before they really need new staff! The waitress that took care of us didnt bother to check up on us, she was snotty and acted cocky. I asked to speak to the manager, she said she would surely get him. We waited 2 hours! No manager, and no waitress!! Really?! I called later that day after we finished and a young lady answered and i asked to speak to a manager she asked what it was regarding, i told her a complaint and 2 minutes after she hung up. Come on.. so now ill just write a review on here. This place has decent food, but the staff there is what will be the death of them.",

I get it, clubs are both of those things, but it gets old when it's excessive and you're bumped into every five seconds and can't hear your friends. Plus, whenever a bottle service table was about to be occupied, the bouncers cleared a path around the table about five feet wide, which was a bit dramatic and led to even more crowding for everyone else. Finally, the waitresses' outfits...really?",

Roommate's boyfriend got in wearing sneakers, no problemo. \"Oh, but his have his jeans over his tongues.\"  \"Ohhh-kay, I'll put my jeans over my tongues.\"  \"No man, you can't do that.\"  What the heck?   Roommate returns at this point with a friend that works inside, who waves the bouncer off and lets my boyfriend in.  Roommate and boyfriend pick a spot at the bar, get their drinks. I stand at the same exact spot and get told not once, but FOUR times by different staff that I need to move; first to the right, then back to the left, and repeat. Apparently you are in the way of the super special flowers that are the staff no matter where you stand.  $15 plus tip for a bottle of Coors Light and a Long Island (made with bottom shelf, plastic bottle liquor).   No dance floor. Constant \"bottle service parades\" of 5-6 people with strobe light wands got old real fast.  And then for the piece de resistance, we watched them  let in a bunch of guys wearing shorts, t-shirts and slip-on Toms type shoes..  We will not be back.",

Then went to another bar tender asked for a Dos Equis and she gave me one in a bottle, and I asked if they had it on draft, and with an attitude told me that that was not what I asked for. And rudely poured it up. Ok.   To blatantly put it, fuck this place. I've never been treated so badly in my life.",

    "text": "Such a horrible experience! : ( I'm from Tucson and was in phx for the day. After enjoying a nice day around 11:30 pm we were searching for a fun place to go out on a Monday, because my boyfriend's bday was going to come at midnight. After searching for an hour for places to go, we finally came across bottled blonde.  I was excited because I had old friends that worked there and heard good things. So we park and walk in anticipation towards the music. We look good, I have a little black dress on and my boyfriend has a white button up. (It's a Monday!) When we finally walk up into the establishment, the security says he can't let us in because my boyfriend is wearing \"Jordan's\".  So we go back to his car and we have no backup shoes, it's too late to go shopping at this point (for new shoes) so we look and fail to find another place that's open and with a small crowd. At this point it's midnight and my boyfriend (in disappointment) decides to just go home. : ( so in a final attempt to go back to bottled blonde, I call and ask to speak to a manager. We got him on the phone and explained the situation, it's his birthday and we are from out of town and plan on spending money. He then tells me if we buy a bottle he will let us in. I ask how much a bottle is and he says $325.  Um well we were planning on spending a lot but we weren't planning on getting waisted drinking a bottle just him and I, so I tell him we don't plan on getting a bottle and he just tells us to have a good night. Well we definitely had both our nights ruined and I will be telling everyone about this horrible experience.  Seriously it was his birthday, we were dressed nicely, planned on spending money and it was a MONDAY- a night where that money counts. So sad. If I could give zero stars, then I would.",

Security's response when I ask why he got in and I didn't? \"We like him\". GOOD RESPONSE.

The wife and I made our way here to grab a bite because we saw photos from a previous Yelp review that made it look like a chill, indoor/outdoor spot with some decent food options... Instead, we walking into a full blown lounge/club environment with a limited menu. We figured we would bear through things and ordered some meatballs (3/5) and garlic knots (2/5).   The four-star rating is based on them as a club, the servers and bar tenders were efficient, and friendly. Drinks were delivered quickly and service was very attentive. Security was very prevalent and actually very friendly compared to \"bouncers\" and \"security\" staff of similar establishments. My wife and I held a few fun conversations with them while enjoying our people-watching.  When my guy friends come to town and want to hit the town, Bottled Blonde will be one of our first or last stops.",

We went to go grab brunch there and were directed to this place. We thought it looked sorta cool and were starving. We seriously passed up several killer breakfast joints while en route to this place but gave it the benefit of the doubt...dammit. Shouldn't have. Menu was boring, lackluster and not even close to RnR in food comparison. Our server was a male bartender, he was really nice. All the servers stared us down as if we were a couple from outer-space and never greeted us, just stared us down....so lame!   I got just two eggs over easy and dry sourdough. My toast came buttered but whatever, not the biggest deal. My boyfriend got the triple breakfast taco plate, it was super lame. Cheap, but so lame. I mean, literally just unseasoned scrambled eggs on top of two bacon strips in one, chorizo and eggs tossed on top in another and the same potatoes served on the side in the third with scrambled eggs and no seasoning in the third....pretty much flavorless. Our server was nice, the atmosphere was loud and open but so trying too hard to be something it's not. It was not a place we would ever go back to. Way too many excellent options to sell ourselves short again....damn.",

So we go right down the street to the Mall so the boys could pick up something else to wear. We go back to Bottled Blonde, different security guard, everyone was good except my Man because he was wearing Lebrons. When we told the security guard that we were just there a little less than an hour ago and my Man was told he was good with what he was wearing, the security guard just kept telling us no but if we bought a table. There's no real system on the dress code. For the last few years My Man always gets a table at Bottle Blonde for the Ohio State vs Michigan game and never has any problems with what he wears. So anyways, we went to three wisemen, which they were more welcoming. We ended up buying bottles after bottles of champagne which Bottle Blonde missed out on.",

Today at 3:45 on 4/24 We just got done with brunch and wanted to continue the party so decided to come to your establishment. We're all familiar with Bottled Blond because there is one in Chicago where we are all visiting from. As we begin to enter, half of us walk in and when it comes to our friend Lexi, they say I'm sorry we have a dress code and there is a rule of no eccentric hair. We were not upset abut the rule since many bars in Chicago also have dress codes however imagine our surprise when we can visibly see a women with blue mermaid hair. So we say ok and walk across the street to The District we and obviously very upset about the situation we then see a man walk across the street with Leopard print hair and he walks right into your bar. I do not want place judgement on anyone working at your bar unlike then judgement that was placed on our friend but it's concerning to me that both of the patrons that were allowed to enter with \"eccentric hair\" we're both white and our friend is black. This does not sit well with any of us. It sends a very bad message that you can't enforce this rule if your going to let certain race in with eccentric hair and not the other! This may not have been the case however it is hard for us to wrap our minds around the facts and not come to the conclusion that race was the deciding factor. We are all industry, all sober and not allowing our entire party to enter over a rule that was clearly not being followed for everyone is baffling and very off putting. If I could I would attaching both photos of the women and their \"eccentric\" hair styles. Needless to say we will not be returning to your establishment in Arizona or back in Chicago as we wouldn't want to offend any other patrons with our eccentric hair or support a business that treats customers (only black ones of course) in an extremely inappropriate manner.",

We have visited this location a few times prior to this experience so the situation that took place was quite appalling.  Matthew stated my wife is not the person on her ID.  So we presented a credit card with her name on it.  What more proof do you need?   Well, there are plenty of other bars that would be happy to take our money so we were going to go to El Hefe instead, No BS at that spot.  However, Matthew did not want to give my wife back her ID.  This is where I got irritated you wasted my time for 10 minutes already, now you're trying to waste another 5 min?  Well I wanted to call the police and get this squared away, we have proof this is her identification and Matthew is clearly an idiot that needs more training.  Then some very tall gargantuan meat head looking fellow starts yelling at the top of his lungs saying we should not be swearing.  Guy, this isnt church, I will say whatever the hell I want especially because your keeping us here wasting our time.  Sigh.  Matthew ended up giving us back the ID before the police were called and this whole situation could have been avoided if he gave us back the ID.  But now im stuck writing this essay telling you about my shitty experience at this location.  I would not recommend going to this location.",

I've been here before during the night way too many people which is good thing for business bad thing for folks who prefer less crowded bars.  But they went ALL OUT for the game being from Columbus and the Buckeye fan that I am I appreciated it. Apparently this is a Buckeye bar which I know now and will definitely be back for some games next year.  They had the whole street blocked off with a band and the game on what seemed like 4556465 tv's along with a big screen above the stage showing the game it was really really good time.   Crazy that this was 9am and it was crowded full of Buckeye fans with some unfortunate Michigan fans here and there that somehow made it out unscathed that would NOT have happened in Columbus lol   But enough about the Buckeyes...  The bar itself is pretty big they had a few bars set-up outside if you been to the Ghost Ball or the other block parties they have down there between Bottled Blonde and Maya you'll already know how it's set-up.  Haven't tried their food yet but walking to the restroom look at others food it looked really good. I'll have to check it out during the day for happy hour or something.   Definitely a nice place but if you don't like big crowds stay away on Friday and Saturday nights.   Oh and one more thing folks seem to overlook in all their reviews Bottled Blonde has FREE WIFI haha",

Since we were visitors of the area, the bartenders were so friendly and easy going to chat with! Not only did they give us exceptional service, but invited us back to the bar later that night. Unfortunately, my friends and I didn't make it out that night, but the bartender, Jillian, was the one who went out of her way to make us feel welcome and invite us back!   Great drinks, good prices, inviting & fun environment.",

They don't really have that great of a beer selection, which I would expect from a place with the name Bottled Blonde. The DJ has been quite fabulous the few times I have been here (nice remix of older songs mixed in with the hip and new).   I don't think I would ever eat here, unless I was inebriated and my taste buds were impaired.  But in comparison to other bars in the 'vortex of the Old Town Bermuda triangle' I recommend it.",

This behavior is ridiculous and uncalled for.   This was what happened:  It was about 8:30 on Saturday. This was our first stop and the first drink I ordered. We had NOT pre drank. My buddy had purchased a round and the mixed drink he got was beyond weak for $8.   Then when I asked for a vodka sprite I watched the female bartender put barely a splash of vodka in my drink. The amount was def less than the standard amount. I politely asked her to add more vodka. She accused me of being wasted and told me she was going to charge me $16 dollars for a double if I wanted more vodka added. Her exact words were \"maybe you can't taste the vodka because you are so drunk!\" I clearly wasn't drunk or even buzzed at ALL. I kindly explained to her this was the first drink I ordered. She didn't apologize and caused such a scene that a person standing standing next to me who wasn't even with our group even said something. I couldn't believe she had that audacity to be so rude.   If I could do it over again I would have talked to a manager right at that moment.   It would have been different if I was drunk or was being rude, but I was being very sober, kind, and very reasonable.",

Immediately, I was asked to move from my location. I did say \"hey chill out we just got here, let me get acclimated\". The response from the bouncer was \"do you have a problem? Chill out?\" Word were exchanged with the new staff and I said chill out \"douchebag\" which i 100% claim. I was removed respectfully. I was not provided with the security guards name, I was told I wouldn't be allowed in the club because of the name calling which is fine. However, the exchange felt extremely personal from one adult to another. Again, this was not a racial situation, it was a security guard taking his authority too serious and feeling he could be disrespectful to somebody. I tried to have this conversation with the bar manager, however...he was just worried about if i wanted to re enter which I was not interested. Ultimately, i have LOVED blondes and been respected by the staff through my years of partying in Scottsdale. THIS situation has ruined the 3 years I have came to this bar on Monday, Tuesday or Thursday etc. no problem. Tonight the new security guard, overstepped respectfully and I feel it needed to be documented.",

I stroll up in a collared shirt, dark golf shorts, and a icey pair of Jordan 11 lows (fresh out the box). They stop me and say \"no Jordan's you can't come in\".

Thank god security kicked him out!   There were a few corporate people dancing on table tops, and they got to because clearly they were paying top dollar for bottle service, while other people tried and they kicked them right off.

All of my caucasian coworkers were of course told their attire was fine (they ended up sticking with me instead which i'm very grateful for).

The music is of course pretentiously loud, each individual in the crowd thinks they are way too cool for the place, drinks are expensive and taste like gasoline diluted with lime juice. Back to the Moscow Mule, it's hard to imagine how proportions can be messed up every time here, thus don't even bother asking for a good vodka. It will all be the same, drowned in the soullessness of this establishment. If visiting for the purposes of seeing this ridiculous scene, keep the visit short, grab a beer and get rolling.",

    "text": "RACIST!!!! This place tagged my sister and I, while sitting at the bar waiting for our drinks, as being sloppy and spilling beer in their bathroom. My sister and I had walked in straight from another bar and hadn't even ordered a drink. Yet, when they saw us sitting at the bar and beer spilled in their bathroom, they automatically assumed it was us(the brown ones).  There was a multitude of people who it could've been, but NAH, they went straight for us. They approached us at the at the bar, when we were still waiting for our first drink, and accused us of spilling beer in their bathroom. We simply explained that it wasn't us and they could check their cameras because we hadn't even ordered a drink yet. Not even 10 minutes later, as soon as we had gotten our drinks(two beers), security came to escort us out. For what reason? We have no idea. We asked them time and time again, and all they said is we \"had to leave\".  So, fuck them and their bullshit establishment, I left. My sister stayed back to get her reimbursement on the drinks we had just ordered while the bullshit racist security, stared at me across the way. They refused to refund her card for the amount and eventually told her they had escorted us out for \"the way you ordered beers\". This place is a fucking joke, and if you enjoy it, Well, you're a joke as well. I can honestly say I'm disappointed in the people I came here with that stayed, after we were humiliated in such a way.",

I came here on a not-so-busy Thursday for HH, which is probably why my experience was a little more positive than others who've reviewed the place.   I liked the atmosphere. There's quite a bit of seating, and I like they large bar right in the center. Service was fine as well.  I came with a friend and we split an order of truffle fries & a pizza (honestly, I can't remember which one, but it was a veggie one since she's a vegetarian). They were both yummy! Pizzas are half off during HH (they're the only food deal that's offered during HH).   I also had a couple beers. I can't remember what the deals are during HH, but they do have drink specials. Bottled Blonde has a pretty good selection of brews, but for a place that actually promotes itself as a Beer Garden, I was expecting a little bit more. I can't think of anything they had that you normally couldn't find at a place that has craft beer on tap.   Overall though, I think this is a good, casual place for HH. I'm used to places offering more food deals during this time, but the pizza I had was delicious, and I can see why they really promote them.   It sound like this is a MUCH different place on a Friday or Saturday night (or Sunday Funday, perhaps), but for weekday HH, I like Bottled Blonde.",

So we hopped on over here to see what this place was all about. Which was, not much.  It was easy and quick getting in. Once in, there's a couple of large bars. Around them is seating: couches, bar stools, etc. In the back there is a long fire pit which was convenient and nice on a cold night.  Near the bathrooms are games you can play, which is cute. The bathrooms were clean and the lighting was great, bright enough to fix makeup and check yourself.   The bartenders seemed overworked since everyone here seems to conjugate around the bar itself. I think they need more bartenders.   Overall, it wasn't very exciting. I think I'll take friends here that don't like clubbing or dancing and just want to \"chill out\" with a beer or something.",

However, even though we were there in time for both specials the very rude bartender told us because it was final four this weekend that there were no specials so they could make more money. Pretty sure it's illegal to price gouge in AZ. I should have left when she said that. Our meal was mediocre at best.  We ordered a margarita pizza and a mushroom pizza. Both good both not something I would make the trip back for.  The ceasar salad was anything but. We still haven't figured out what the taste was. The croutons on the salad were fluffy bread burnt on a grill. Weird! When the bill came I almost fell over at the price for my Jameson and Ginger.  I'm from So Cal and am used to LA prices but this was seriously inane.  $10.19 for a high ball that tasted like there was maybe 2 drops of whiskey.  My bill even shows that I was charged 3% for what I'm assuming is a fee for using a debit card. This restaurant did have a nice atmosphere but that's about all it had going for it.",

    "text": "We came here on a Saturday night with a group of girls. Let me preface this review by saying I was completely sober and didn't have a single drink the entire night. For whatever reason, the bouncers decided 10pm on a crowded Saturday night was a good time to move tables and booths across the packed bar. The bouncers were extremely aggressive and exceptionally rude and disrespectful. Instead of creating a pathway to move things, the bouncers literally just ran into people and pushed them out of the way. They ran into our group without warning, causing us to stumble forward and almost fall. The second time, we were all standing in a circle talking, when a 250+ pound bouncer moving a table backed into me, a 110 pound woman, back to back, and almost completely knocked me down. I stuck my arm and elbow out to redirect my weight so that he wouldn't knock me over and step on me and he aggressively yelled at me, directly in my face, \"WHY WOULD YOU ELBOW ME WHEN I'M SAYING EXCUSE ME\" and then proceeded to call me a \"FUCKING BITCH\" and shake his head at me. It was extremely loud and the bouncer was yelling in the opposite direction, so I couldn't hear him, and like I said, we were back to back, so I couldn't see him either. I'm not going to just let someone push me down onto the floor and injure me. This is both unlawful and unsafe. I understand that there are going to be a lot of drunk people in a bar like this, and the bouncers need to be assertive, but they do not have to be physically and verbally aggressive. You cannot just push and yell at patrons. Move the tables and booths at a less crowded time or create a path.",

Meanwhile the dress code also says no athletic sneakers but he's letting in everyone wearing Nikes (and apparently flip flops/tank tops/bathing suits are ok too but not my H&M boots).  Seems like they want to interpret my clothing the way they want so they can let in who they want.  I also questioned why my boots are considered work boots by him and he screamed \"Get the f*&% out of here, its my f*&^ing door so leave\".  Great way to treat locals.  I asked to see a manager, and he said no.  I asked for the manager's business card, he also said no.  I then asked the other door bouncer to speak to the manager, and all he did was bring out the \"head\" bouncer.    I seriously don't know what kind of power trip these guys are on, its sad to see them act like they own the place and discriminate at the door.  I used to spend a lot of money here but not anymore.",

The first time wasn't horrible but the food wasn't great and servers made me feel like I was inconveniencing them every time I asked for another drink or anything at all. Top that off with food that took forever to show up, it shouldn't take that long to throw some cheese on a plate with some toast (I had the burrata) and sauce, and it wasn't even good it was bland.  The second time I came was a disaster. The guy who was serving us was just a rude dick the entire time and was too busy chit chatting with co-workers and watching the games himself to take care of us. This was an early game so I ordered the eggs benedict, while it wasn't bad the fact that it sat for several minutes on the bar while out server was too busy to be bothered to do his job chit chatted away and stared at his female co-workers. Finally one of the women behind the bar saw this and brought us our food.  At the end when I got my bill it noticed extra charges for stuff I never even asked for such as bacon which did show up on my plate but I never asked for it and just assumed it came with breakfast...I know crazy logic jump on my part. There was some other charge as well for something I didn't even get. I just remember this was $3 extra in charges on a $20 bill and while $3 isn't an issue the point was I shouldn't be charged for it. I pointed it out to the server and he went away in huff to look at it. He comes back 5 minutes later and says in a fantastically condescending tone \"So you're arguing over three dollars?\" At which point I tell him yes I am and I never ordered that stuff. He leaves in a huff again and comes back and just drops the revised bill and walks off. I wonder if he got upset about there not being $3 for a tip on there for him.  This place was dropped by the Scottsdale Seahawks group after that game because I wasn't the only one with these issues.  This place is on the fast track to being yet another in the long line of failed bars in old town. Save your time and money and go elsewhere.",

A cocktail waitress named Erica who wasn't even our server all night...presented the bill..which was the correct amount and I tipped 20% on 300. She demanded that I tip her on a $600 table....ummm what?? I said very calmly I am sorry but you are mistaken we booked this table at $300 as the bill clearly states. She grabbed my credit card and ID out of my hands and said I am photo copying your ID and CC so we can run this with 20% on $600. I said unfortunately that is against the law Erica...but go ahead and try. Long story short I called the manager and explained what went down... he was mortified. It is absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced by this cocktail waitress. She is a liability to this bar as we had a great time up until she came along. Unfortunately this place will not see myself or family's business again until she is no longer an employee.",

It is like being packed inside a sardine can, I have been injured by heels multiple times and I cannot even count how many drinks have been spilled on me due to the mass amount to people inside trying to move about. The only reason I even stepped foot in this place again was because I had a few drinks beforehand, so I did not think much of it. Lastly, I have permanent hearing loss in one ear due to this place, the music was insanely loud, and I am not just being wussy, I can handle loud noise. Every minute or so the DJ would play this obnoxious horn sound that was 2 times louder than the music. Needless to say, will not be returning here. You do not need to deafen your customers!",

I reached out Dan from HiFi (Great guy with New York style) and not only did he take a break from his busy schedule to meet me while at lunch, he put me in touch with AJ and Chase at Bottle Blonde. I purchased bottle service (The only way you should enjoy Scottsdale) the entire weekend  in a couple of different sections. Sara, our server, was amazing! Timely checks in, great conversation and all round positive vibe. This last thing might set them over the top but the security was on point! In a place this big with the amount of people they host you have to have great security team that's on the same page. Major shout out to AJ, Carl, Kenny and there are 2 others that unfortunately I don't remember their name but their service was greatly appreciated! In all, thank you Bottle Blonde and the entire EEG team for a great weekend!",

    "text": "This is what you will experience here.  I was visiting some friends in Scottsdale from out of town and after a day of business I attended Bottled Blonde on July 9th 2016. It was a little after midnight and the establishment was extremely overcrowded by the time I got there. I went to purchase some beers at the front entrance and accidentally (because of overcrowding) ended up slightly outside the front door. I was than confronted by the front door bouncer who assault and battered me by grabbing my hand and my personal beers that I just purchased for me and my friend. An altercation occurred and about 5 bouncers took me down to the ground. While I was on the ground they kicked me in my head, ribs, stomach, kidneys, they jumped me like I was a gang member (I am a Tennis Professional). They proceeded to handcuff me and laid me down on my stomach, \"Hog tie\" style. I begged them not to break my shoulder, which one of the bouncers stated, \"I'll break whatever I want\". They physically broke my left foot with their hands. I got a bad concussion, rib contusions and a broken left foot. I ended up suing them in Federal Court for injuring and almost killing me. I missed work and lost out on numerous business opportunities as a result. The city of Scottsdale retaliated (because I also sued them) and filed bogus misdemeanor criminal charges against me in state court. Apparently they tried to file felony charges against me, but the felony charges wouldn't stick, so they settled on misdemeanors. As I've been doing my research I've come to find out that this is standard procedure for not only bottled blonde who injures it's patrons, but police departments and cities like the city of Scottsdale who condone the violence of security guards and collude with local businesses such as bottled blonde in an attempt to stifle anyone who dares to stand up for themselves. I was injured. I lost work. I can't sleep well to this day. And instead of taking responsibility for their actions, they are lying and trying to paint ME to be the bad guy! They are attempting to bare False witness against me as I write this review.  Anyone who was there that night please message me, I have some questions for you. Anyone who had a bad, racist experience there, message me. I need to talk to you.",

Don't really care....try it for yourself, and I guarantee you'll be disappointed; Im willing to put money on that!  Want more info hit me up....not scared to get real descriptive with it because it was atrocious from the door.  This place can't do much worse than its existing dismal reviews.... so my shitty review seems to coincide with the existing mass opinion that you will absolutely be wasting every penny spent here.  Don't do it...they don't deserve you're hard earned money and their pretentious attitude will leave you wishing you had just stayed home",

He let him buy a shirt and go in no problem  but it was kind of embarrassing  to be treated like that in front of a bunch of people... Been working with a lot of bars for a long time and have never been treated so poor especially when I just hand delivered customers. Zane is obviously unhappy and maybe he needs some training. Best of luck.",

Decided to check out bars across the street, had few more drinks here and there, but we decided to come back to Blonde, because they had some decent music playing. After spending lots of time there earlier in the day, they're telling us we can't come back in, because one of our companions has \"Jordan's\" on. It's funny, how it didn't bother nobody, when he had them on few hours ago when he was spending all the money for drinks. Mimosas are good, dj seems to be ok too, place is full of douchelords and sissy girls, but once you ignore all that you can have good time with your friends.",

    "text": "Yesterday around 3 PM, a group of my friends and I headed to Bottled Blonde AZ. A friend who is a woman of color approached security first, showed her ID, and then stepped in the door and to the side to wait for us. I was next in line, and by the time I could say a word to the bouncer he had turned around and was demanding that she leave, saying that she was \"over-intoxicated\" because she did not go straight into the bar once she entered. We all explained that she was simply waiting for us, but he continued to berate her and tell her she was not permitted. We of course all left at that time.  Shortly after, I called in to explain the incident to management. We identified the security guard in question, and I was told by the manager that he would review the security tapes and get back to me. I asked how long this would take, and he immediately got defensive, telling me that they were very busy and he didn't know. I asked if he saw issues such as this as unimportant, and he hung up on me. Another friend soon called in to ask about the incident, only to be told that there were no security guards fitting that description (even though he had just identified him when speaking with me), and again hung up on us. I also called the District Manager afterwards, but have yet to hear back. While all of us thought this was a racist act, I was hoping for another explanation. After a quick search on Facebook, Yelp, and Google however, I found that racism is clearly a persistent problem Bottled Blonde AZ.  The excerpts in the photo are only a portion of the complaints. Any responsible business owner would immediately respond to these comments, and do what they can to correct the situation, but Bottled Blonde has not responded to a single one. This proves that they are complicit and even condoning this bigoted behavior. It is absolutely disgusting that a popular local business can continue to operate on such discriminatory policies. I don't normally get political or opinionated on social media, but when a thriving business is so clearly in the wrong, it would be irresponsible to stay silent. I hope that enough attention can be brought to this issue for a change to be made.",

I made my way to the bar and the bar tender who was making other drinks looked at me and kindly let me know he would be right with me! I was impressed.   Almost every bar tender you approach these days ( yes in the Scottsdale area) just looks right through you and gets around to you when he feels like it. No greeting or nothing.   Anyways the bartender made it back to me and he made some great beer suggestions and also answered my food related questions. He made a great pizza recommendation and also let me know of the other great foods they had. Let me know that his name was Sean and if my group and I needed anything else, just to let him know!  Overall it was just nice to go somewhere where the service staff was just flat out nice and helpful. It is rare these days to see customer service shining through when an establishment is really busy and packed full of thirsty people. I will definitely  be coming back here and i hope Sean is working again!",

As a mm educated black female in Scottsdale I surprisingly haven't felt much racism but today at this establishment it came to fruition. The bouncer (he was very tall, large and had a beard) kicked me out and said I backed into a table. Now, granted I had already been drinking but no I did not  back into anything. And my Friends ALL backed me up. It is rare that my friends will not call me out for being drunk and acting dumb, but for once they al clearly saw that I was not acting in any way other than standing there waiting for everyone else to get in. I'm sorry but I will not tolerate this type of discrimination. And I will say this is not the first time I've had a run in with this racist bouncer. Bottled blonde just lost all of our business.

    "text": "We came here yesterday for Sunday Funday with a group of about 11 friends.  All we wanted to do was enjoy our afternoon, watch the games, and grab some food/drinks.  We sat in a couch area to your right as you walk in....a server came up pretty quickly, but had a horrible attitude.  She was super irritated right off the bat.  She asked how many there was going to be in our group and if we were wanting separate checks.  When we answered yes, her irritation level skyrocketed.  I asked her to just let me know whatever it is she wanted us to do in order to make the process easier, but she just kind of rolled her eyes and never even answered me.  As this was all happening....another member of my group had asked an employee to change one of the tv's that no one was watching (because there were no seats on that side of the bar) to a specific game....and she was told that they couldn't.  After them not being able to change the game (we weren't asking for sound, just for picture...and weren't interrupting anyone else's game) along with the attitude from the server (who I later found out her name was Libby).....we got up to leave.  As we were heading out the door, the bouncer and hostess asked why we were leaving.....in which the bouncer replies that there's no problem in changing the channel.  I still didn't want to go back in, because the server, Libby, was not someone I wanted to give my business to if she wasn't willing to even help us out.  You should never act that way towards your guests....especially when there are so many other options for us....and the competition has even better specials (and food/drink in general).  We weren't being rude or obnoxious.....it was still pretty early, we were trying to help her.  I decided to go back in with the rest of my group and luckily we got a different server...Bui...and she was awesome.  She was nice, helpful, did separate checks for us without an irritated roll of the eyes or comment.....an overall great server with a smile.  I watched Libby continue to serve her other tables, and she never smiled.  Not the type of person I want to have helping me out.  Had a great time there, because of the group I was with, but aside from the bouncer and Bui (who were awesome) the service and food totally lack.  I won't be back there by choice.",

It's gotten so bad that I've even brought my white girl friends there (thinking they can't honestly be racist or homophobic) and without missing a beat my colored and gay friends are always asked to leave. I've  bought a table there before and they're whole demeanor changes (that's when they don't want you to leave). If you're not a white girl or a straight white man don't go here. Even my white straight friends have called this place directly to tell them how racist and homophobic they are. It's to gotten to the point that something has to be done. Again.... I've gone multiple times in 7 years thinking that I had to be wrong in my thinking but after many different approaches there's only one conclusion. Racist, homophobic, douchebags!!!!!!!!!!!!",

If you don't buy bottles, you probably won't get great service here. We had showed up fairly early and taken a table with no problem, but as it got later, the bouncers were trying to find ways to get a member of our group kicked out so we would leave.   I get it, they're a business, but would have preferred them just to ask us to give up the table as opposed to being jerks and trying to get one of us kicked out.   3 stars overall as I didn't have a great experience, but if you're ready to drop cash for bottle service, you will likely have a good time here.",

They have a great sized building, multiple bars and attractions inside, outdoor seating, great scenary, TV's for sports games, and great quality food service. Definitely a spot to check out when coming out to Scottsdale.",

Now, they blast hip-hop as if trying to sound a desperate siren to attract people away from its competition across the street and next door.  Most of the bartenders look harried and miserable.  Good luck getting a drink in a reasonable amount of time.  Despite living in the neighborhood and frequenting this place for more than a year, the bouncer I'm most familiar with would not let me in the front ropes on a weekend night.  Guess customer loyalty means nothing to the owners.  This on top of the fact that I likely saved their asses from a lawsuit when a girl fell down hitting her head and neck, barely remaining conscious, while I intervened to ensure the manager and any bystanders did not move her until the ambulance arrived.  I don't recall getting any thank you for that either.  Guess helping to protect their business means nothing to them too.  The bottom line is that Bottled Blonde is Broken.",
