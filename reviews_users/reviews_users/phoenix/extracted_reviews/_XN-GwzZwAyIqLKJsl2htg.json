Sat at the bar with Jeremy, who was slinging drinks, recommending food and chatting up customers better than Tom Cruise in Cocktail ( he is not old enough to know that movie.:). We had Chicharron de pollo with Miso Mustard.  The miso mustard balanced the crispy chicken.  Next was Rock Shrimp Tempura with a truffle aioli that we loved.  The secret sauce, In house made Mango Habanero sauce that Jeremy shared kicked it up a notch.  Finally we ended with the Chinese Style Crab Garlic Noodles.  Foodie food for sure.  Delicately composed, with a nice depth in flavor.  The garlic was surprisingly subtle, but there.  The spice was just right.  A dish we will order again! We will be back!  Atmosphere is crowded but bearable. We will be back!",

A friend of mine was just in this restaurant this afternoon with a couple of his friends. They sat down for a nice meal ordered a couple of drinks and food and sat for about twenty minutes just enjoying themselves while waiting for their meal, when the manager came over and told them that the restaurant has a \"dress code\". Two of his friends were wearing sleeveless shirts and no where did it say \"sleeveless shirts not allowed\" and they were not showing anymore than arms. They then asked to speak to the owner of the restaurant. The owner came over and RUDELY asked them to leave the restaurant immediately, but not before they paid the bill in FULL for food they did not get to touch. They refused to pay, again, for food they DID NOT TOUCH and got up to leave and the owner called the cops on them and followed them out of the restaurant. I do not encourage ANYONE to eat here! That's disgusting behavior.",

Our server Kellan took excellent care of us and helped by bringing us some of his fav's... we started with the pumpkin seed topped guacamole that was served with small tostada-like chips with a great spice on them... then we had the bacon wrapped medjool dates - delicious, rich, but too much for a party of 2 I must say as they were pretty filling... and lastly he brought us the mushroom tacos that were amazing!  Super fresh soft homemade tortillas wrapped around mushroom-y deliciousness!  Wish I weren't so full as I would have ordered another round of those!  Oh, did I mention the Sumo-Rita?  That was over the top delicious and worth every penny!!  I thought the menu was reasonably priced for what you got.  I will most definitely be back!  Good job guys!!",

Let me say I am NOT an adventurous eater.  We sat \" outside\" and it was gorgeous.  The music was loud for us but hey, we're married.  We don't need to hear each other that well.  The prices are a little high for our budget but I was tired of the regular suspects.   I got the California roll (not adventurous, remember?)  And it was wonderful.  Not only was the sushi great and everything fresh, there was a generous amount of crab piled on top!  Bonus!Presentation was very nice but I'm about the food.  More than enough ginger and wasabi on the side.   My husband got the something pepitas sandwich.  The size of the serving of seasoned fries and sandwich were huge.  The roll looked chewy but was fluffy and awesome. The steak was to die for.  If you don't like rare, turn and run. If you're like me, sit and tuck in your napkin.  I'm not a $12 lunch girl UNLESS I get PLENTY and QUALITY.  It can't be just plenty. Would I prefer a half portion for half the price? Duh.  Is that going to happen in his land of too-much-plenty? Don't think so.   Will go again and split something.  Our server Danielle was wonderful. Another sucky 85' Feb day in yucky Scottsdale!  ( this is 2 hours later and I'm still stuffed.)",

Our experience was excellent from the moment we stepped into the restaurant, to the server to the food. As this was our first visit, the server was very helpful providing  insight into the different dishes. If you go in a group, I would advice that everyone order something different as everything the menu is wonderful. We really enjoyed the whole experience.  Please note, the only reason I give SumoMaya four instead of a five is for me, it was a little pricey. For a special occasion, I would definitely go back.",

Our server was obviously quite busy, yet she was pleasant and efficient. Because it was a holiday we were only able to order from a brunch menu. We all chose the same dish, an omelet with crab, red onion, and avocado. The food was tasty although it seemed to take quite some time to be served. The presentation was nicely done. I had hoped to order fried chicken skins but I will have to come back for them. Overall, I'd rate this place an 8 out of 10.",

There are some awesome fusion dishes as well (sushi roll w/ guacamole). The service is amazing as well as the atmosphere. I've never been a fan of eggplant, but the Japanese eggplant is phenomenal. After moving to AZ 4 months ago, I've to this restaurant the most and have enjoyed it every single time. If you go, you have to try the BACON WRAPPED MEDJOOL DATES aka orgasm on a plate. The dates are stuffed with chorizo and queso chihuahua, and served over a bed of foie gras sauce. It's probably the only restaurant I've been eating and wondered if a DJ was playing the music in the background...and I was correct. Probably the only time I've enjoyed a sushi roll while bouncing to BBD \"Poison\".",

This place had all of the above.  I only tried a limited selection of food but I hope to go back and try a lot more.  The guacamole and shishinto peppers were good but the Bacon Wrapped Dates were excellent.  What I liked most is the Atmosphere.  This place was well put together.  It was trendy but not smug. The service was excellent.  Having spent some time in the \"Industry\" myself, it was a joy to watch management helping out the servers running cocktails and taking drink orders if needed.  Well done guys. I will be back and hope to have a similar experience.",

When SumoMaya first opened, we went and loved it so much that we brought his family for my birthday dinner. Then we brought our friends to try it. It was great! Then we went for lunch one day. Got chicharone guac, always good. The chips they serve with their guacamoles are awesome. I got Pad Thai, he got the chicken sandwich. My lunch was gross....no other way to describe it. Weird flavor a but figured maybe it wasn't for me. His sandwich was ok, fries were very good. The last time we went we brought my cousin and his fiancee. To be honest it was almost embarrassing. The only consistent thing here anymore is the guacamole. All the dishes we'd had previously that were amazing just came out \"eh\". Under seasoned, not fresh....super disappointing. I wish they could have kept up what they started with, at this point I'm not interested in ever going back. Not a cheap risk to take.",

Our server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.",

    "text": "Pretty awesome concept that is hard to pull off but Sumomaya has done it.  If you want to go to a trendy restaurant that can satisfy a group of picky eaters who wants different ethnic cusine, you want to try Sumomaya.  Ceviche and tacos were spot on.  Sushi and rolls were excellent - fresh and tasty.  I would recommend Suzuki roll like many other yelpers; however it does have strong cumin or tumeric after taste so it definitely is not a typical japanese roll.  The pomegranate guacamole was very good as well but again be warned that it is a bit spicy.  I tried their Pork Pad Thai (one of their more popular dish) but it was a bit too salty for me just like their seaweed salad (very salty cucumber pieces which didn't add anything to the dish).  The coconut soup was divne -  I really enjoyed the coconut curry soup and it was well presented like all of their other dishes.",

It was a small roll and not much flavor. I'd pass on it and go for something more interesting! Atmosphere was great and servers are very attentive and helpful making menu selections.",

The restaurant was busy, but far from full. The receptionist told us that it would be a 45 minute wait.......or that we could sit in the bar. The bar had plenty of empty tables, so we took a seat.  We sat for 20 minutes while servers passed us by without bringing us water, menus, or even acknowledging our presence. We watched while servers stood around and chatted.........we even watched one server take a shot of tequila ( the bar had made an extra one for the table next to us......we watched as he downed it ) We finally left.......",

The mole was pretty close to my Grandma's and the sweetness of the plantains, drenched in mole sauce...Wow!   I also ordered the Hamachi Jalapeno roll and Chamoy-Mango Rita...perfect balance of Sweet & Spicy. Service was fast but the DJ had the volume on 100, making it very difficult for our waitress to hear our order. We were there on a Friday night and next visit, I will definitely return.   If you're in the Scottsdale area, Sumomaya is a must. If you don't want to shout your order, try mid-week or midday.",

The service was extremely terrible, took a long time to even get our drinks and an even longer time to even get the attention of our waitress to order our food. The food took a crazy long time to come out and we couldn't even eat the guacamole because of how spicy and hot it was. We had the waitress take it back and no one even offered to refund it or even give us a new one which is a common thing to do at ANY restaurant. The food was also extremely subpar and wasn't spectacular how it normally is. I am extremely disappointed and taken back by how terrible of a night I had especially when we were celebrating a birthday.",

The edamame was flavorful and had a unique taste compared to others. The guacamole was fresh and well-made but they were a bit stingy with the chips-- luckily, our waitress brought out more when we finished the first basket.   The entrees are served tapas style, so the dishes come out when they're ready. If your group is going to order separate entrees instead of sharing, you should expect to be eating at different times/paces depending on what you order. I got the seared Scottish salmon. It was served in a broth with a spoon-- it was very good, cooked perfectly, and again had a unique flavor.   The atmosphere here is very fun and trendy, the decor is adorable and there's music playing- it's the perfect spot for a girl's night out or a date night.",

I would personally try medium next time. The spicy crab roll was not spicy at all for me, but it was still very tasty and I would still recommend it. Our waiter was also great and made great recommendations. I just wish we were locals or they would have gone through with their Houston expansion.",

    "text": "It was a surprise, as I never expected to go back, but we got an opportunity to try SumoMaya a 2nd time.  Some things were a vast improvement, others were the same as my first visit there.   This time we went earlier in the day, and our reservation was ready right on time. The place was still busy, but not packed like before and this time was dinner was much more relaxed and stress-free - I could hear our conversations. SumoMaya is very high energy, and maybe I'm just a fuddy-duddy, but the scene later in the evening is like a nightclub. I much preferred the quieter lower-key earlier dinner hour.  Our service was impeccable! Our waitress was friendly, efficient, and informative.  We also had the manager check in on us, and we felt valued and even a bit pampered. Great service, great people.  The food: We started with the guac and chips, which were more like tostadas. The guac itself was fresh and tasty, but I did not care that much for all the extras piled on top that were salty and very citrus-y. We ended up removing a lot of the peppers, they just weren't working for us. The little tostadas were crispy and seasoned with lime. My wife ordered the coconut soup, and loved it just as much as before. I also sampled it again, and just didn't care for the pungent saffron and coconut, it overwhelmed me a bit. She also got sushi which she gave top marks to; I tried the pork belly roll and found the meat to be fatty and salty, and the seaweed a bit hard to chew on. I've never been a sushi fan, so that's on me. The wife loved her sushi, though she did also remark that meat was very salty; she preferred the seafood rolls. I ordered the carne flank steak - and it was decent. I liked the sear on it, but as sometimes typical with that cut, it ended up being chewy, almost too chewy, despite it being touted as waygu.  It came with a sauce called \"Citrus mojo\" - which I found way too salty and acidic.  I also tried the tacos again, and they are still a bit of a disappointment for me. This time I tried the meat directly, just on its own, and the al pastor and Korean beef were tasty. Not knock my socks off tasty, but the Korean beef was pretty good and the al pastor was ok. Like before, I didn't like the overwhelming toppings, in particular the pickled slaw which I feel kills the savour of the meat. The corn tortillas lacked life, they were limp and bland. I feel the meat in a taco should be the central focus, and the toppings are there just to add zing or crunch, but these tacos were way too dominated by the toppings, leaving the meat to be an afterthought.  We ended with the coconut ice cream - which tasted fresh and was well complimented with toppings and things like freeze-dried coconut (?). It was a nice sweet and refreshing dessert.  Overall: the service is A+. The atmosphere is high energy and not necessarily my personal type of dinner atmosphere. I get why this place is popular and trendy though, they serve their target demographic well I assume. The food is a mixed bag - good marks for the sushi, but not for the mexican side of the fusion.  I would let the sushi be the complex art pieces that they are, and would simplify the tacos to emphasize the savoury meats not the pungent toppings.",

    "text": "SumoMaya is a restaurant with great ambiance and a unique take on food with the Asian-Mexican fusion. Their sushi rolls are quite inventive and beautifully presented. I also enjoyed sharing their noodle dishes. Their tacos I think are a bit underwhelming if I'm being honest.   Service was always attentive and prompt. Especially as they bring out dishes as they are finished, it was a great way to share some food with friends.  Bottomline, great ambiance, good food and good service makes this a solid contender for anyone in the area even though Scottsdale is packed with great locations.",

There are some good offerings on the HH menu, but portions are quite small (korean tacos were teeny tiny) and the \"real crab\" California roll tasted rather odd.  For some reason, I expected the dishes to be a little more creative and geared towards the foodie crowd, but the Mexican Asian fusion wasn't bad, it just didn't offer anything unique or spectacular.  Cocktails are definitely their highlight with the Spicy Peach being the standout. So if you're wanting to hang out in a restaurant that has an energetic vibe, ready to spend a little more $$ for smaller portions and want to be a part of a happening social scene, this place is just for you.",

Well let's start off with the fact that we got there at 4ish so dinner was not yet ready (starts at 5) and we had to sit either by the bar or high top tables. I was a bit bothered by that since it was 3 of us and we were starving. I did not want to share a tiny small table, but we did anyways!   Since the whole dinner thing and not being able to sit at a regular table did bother us at first. We just decided to only have an appetizer/drink and head on to another place but those minutes flew by and the appetizers came out so quick, we were very surprised. I ordered chicken tacos and even though they are super tiny they were AMAZING! Also the calamari was so flavorful. I asked the waitress to surprise me with a drink and she brought out a coconut beverage that was so good and had just the right amount of alcohol in it. We ended up waiting till 5 to move to a bigger table for dinner. No joke we ordered about 10 different plates and they were all wonderful! I had a second drink which was a coconut/pineapple margarita. The waiter did not mention it was frozen which I did not like but either way it was STRONG! (Very well worth your money if I may say so). Overall, service was great and so was everything else. The place is definitely very hip and modern!",

They started making many of their menu items very spicy and took out the savory flavors. The plates are small and the beef had 4/7 slices were chewy and edible- this used to not be that way. The first round of drinks were great and the second round had very little - if any alcohol in them. We had a problem with the check at the end (charged $70 for an $18 bottle of saki - this was a \" computer glitch\". Not sure how this happens when the bottle we got was the $18 and the check said the name of the $18 one but was charged the wrong amount?!?) The manager Jason was VERY RUDE and unprofessional. He was came to our table with fires blazing. He gave attitude for an error on their part. He said they would have caught it - really? They already gave us the bill and we're about to take our money and then they get mad at us for asking you to change it! Don't think he was going to chase us down to give us our money back?!? This is No way to treat customers, especially when you are a large party of people who have been loyal customers for a while. You have lost all of our business...and apparently others because this restaurant was not packed like it used it.",

I'm not a fan of seafood and I like the variety they over on the menu and they are accommodating with tweaking dishes. My last visit I had the kimchee fried rice and they were able to add chicken to it - yum! My husband had the Pad Thai with chicken instead of pork - yum (although he likes the tacos more). Also had the guacamole with pomegranate - yum! I love the Green \"Magic\" Mojito which I look forward to. My friend had sushi and really enjoyed it too. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Had an incredible experience at Sumomaya. Firstly, I loved the decor and the service was amazing. My waiter recommended some awesome dishes and was extremely attentive.  We started with the pomegranate guac, which was so tasty! I have never had pomegranates in guacamole before, but it was so tasty. We also ordered the crispy rock shrimp and the white fish ceviche. The rock shrimp was good but nothing too special (I have had very similar dishes at other restaurants). However the white fish ceviche was amazing. We did one sushi roll, the Suzuki roll. I really liked the texture of the roll. Finally we shared the mahi mahi tacos and the ginger fried rice. We also had a side of the broccolini. The ginger fried rice was my favorite thing, it was so tasty. Would absolutely recommend.   All in all it was a wonderful meal. We had three total people and shared these 6 dishes + 1 side and it was the perfect amount of food. I was very full and very happy after the meal. Had the mochi for dessert, loved it",

Now, the atmosphere was really strange- it felt like it was out of the 90's (like a faux budha bar) with really bad and loud house music and a very odd crowd- lots of ugly tattoos and badly dressed people. Lots of flocks of women- noticeably skewed towards groups of females. That said, the room is very pretty with the tree in the middle and the nice open kitchen. The service was indifferent. If you are from a decent sized city with good restaurants, you will be disappointed.",

Other places are doing the whole pomegranate guac thing as well, but this was the best I've had! I asked the waitress what kind of vegan options they had since the menu didn't clarify, and she rattled off a handful, including a couple of items that weren't on the menu. It was so refreshing that she clearly knew the difference between vegan and vegetarian, which I often find servers don't. I had the veggie roll (one of the vegan items not on the menu) and the arroz verde. Both were fantastic! Wonderful flavors and presentation. We were so stuffed that we didn't have room for dessert, so I'm not sure if they have any vegan desserts. Will definitely return!",

    "text": "Our bachlorette party was so excited to try to \"all you can eat and drink\" brunch at SumoMaya.  It came highly recommended by other Torontonians who had vacationed in AZ.  The entire experience was a let down but the restaurant did try to mitigate the situation and concept is \"fun\" so some stars for that.  The \"all you can eat\" option is $29pp and includes unlimited sides and appetizers for the table served family style.  For an additional $10pp you can add unlimited drinks, the caveat being you need to choose between mimosa, Bloody Mary and margs but of course if you are a bigger group you can trade drinks during refills.  The concept is \"fun\" especially for a bachlorette when the focus resolves around eating and drinking and getting your money's worth!  Our group was seated in the back part of the restaurant by panels of windows with extremely poor air circulation and no evidence of A/C.  The entire restaurant was not cool by any means but walking from our table area to the washroom, we could feel a difference.  Especially coming to AZ from Toronto, our group was not accustomed to 100 F temperatures.  We asked politely if there was another table on several occasions and was told this was the only long table available.  I appreciate we were a big group and the restaurant was packed but the waitress was not prompt with refilling water glasses which is a recipe for dehydration and illness when the group was drinking and extremely overheated due to restaurant's poor A/C and air circulation.  On to the food ... nothing was bad nothing was spectacular other than the appetizer guac.  I think the food quality is somewhat compromised in the \"all you can eat\" style.  Everyone devoured the appetizers.  A lot of the entrees were packed up or wasted as we had already eaten so many apps.  The general feeling from the group was that the apps were much better than the entrees.  I appreciate this could also be due to the fact that most of us were so full by the time the entrees came.  They had a round of bachlorette desserts, most of which were brought home.  At the end of the meal, about half the table was extremely dehydrated and we voiced our concern to the manager about the fact that water glasses were left empty for much of the meal and that the table was in such a hot area of the restaurant.  They agreed to comp the $10 drinking fee on each bill, which was greatly appreciated.  While our waitress was pretty good at handling a large group (other than failing to fill up waters fast), the front door staff were rude.  When we asked to speak to a manager, they were giggling, which was unprofessional and disrespectful.  If groups are going to be seated in such a hot area, they should at least leave water pitchers on the table.",

For $10 extra you can order unlimited mimosas, bloody Mary's, or margaritas (each additional drink is a penny each - but who's counting).   Honestly, I was like a kid in a candy store. The dishes just kept coming! Everything we tried was absolutely delicious. Our favorites were the fluffy scrambled eggs, the sushi roll sampler, and the Chinese sausage fried rice   Definitely bookmark this as your next brunch spot!",

    "text": "Well - I was really looking forward to my time at SumoMaya but it was not what I was expecting. Honestly, it was a very douchy place (DJ turntable at the hostess stand, valets lining up luxury cars out front, LOUD music, bar area was a scene for cougars and middle aged men to pick each other up). None of the food I had was 'bad' - but I do think it was a bit misrepresented so I felt like I didn't get what I ordered/food that I'd actually enjoy.  To start, I arrived for dinner on a Thursday at 6PM and it was extremely loud. Like a sports bar with banging music that makes it hard to have conversation. This wasn't what I was going for nor what I was expecting from reading other reviews online/the menu. The waiter we had was very disinterested in us and didn't offer any advice on ordering for us (even though we had said we were newbies).  Foodwise, here's what we had: - Bacon Wrapped Dates: These were good and fairly True to the menu description. - Seaweed Salad: We've all had it before - WRONG. There was about 2 bites of what you'd expect from a seaweed salad and then a ton of different type of seaweed which was not good. Again, the issue here was that the menu/waiter didn't say to expect anything other than normal seaweed salad. - Suzuki Roll - This was fine and like a custom sushi roll. But wasn't very good. - Hamachi Jalapeno Roll - This roll actually had a large cooked component which was not advertised. Completely threw off the flavor in my opinion.  I know it doesn't sound like it, but we actually are very adventurous eaters and enjoy trying new foods and restaurants. It makes a difference when you know what you're getting and the menu does not accurately describe most dishes and the staff doesn't mention anything either. Had I been provided with an accurate description of the foods, I would have ordered completely differently. Instead, I got about $100 worth of food that was not what I wanted and a bad experience.   We were not the only table around us that felt this way so just use caution when considering dining here. The impression is that they are much more concerned with the appearance of the restaurant and it's clientele vs providing a good experience to their diners. Overall, it was a waste of my evening so I'm hoping to save others!",

The restaurant is cool looking on the outside and even better on the inside. The bar is nice and there are really big TVs. And the reception was great, even by the valet (and we didn't valet the car!).  We ordered a glass of Chardonnay and a glass of Pinot and decided to have the Rainbow Ceviche as an appetizer. Wow, really amazing.  We then had Pork \"Al Pastor\" Pad Thai and Grilled Jumbo Asparagus. The asparagus was also really good. The pad thai was interesting but nothing special.  Overall - we totally enjoyed the food and experience. We will be back!",

    "text": "Fancy fancy Asian Mexican fusion.  Personally, I'm a little wary when it comes to anything Asian fusion.  Mainly because I am Asian, and I get overly critical with the spices.  SumoMaya had turned that negativity to a really positive experience.  We started with the bacon guacamole appetizer.  You're thinking, bacon?  Really?  Seems like everything comes with bacon lately.  Trust me, you won't want to pass this bacon opportunity.  They use thick slices of crisped bacon, cut into large chunks.  it was more of a garnish for the housemate guac.  Yum!  Il liked how extra chunky the guac was, served with the bacon and two pieces of fresh cracklin'.  Never tried fried pork rinds until now, and realize I'm a fan.  I ordered the Korean Tacos and the spicy hamachi roll.  Gotta try both worlds.  Their sushi was average, and felt it lacked the spicy flavor it claimed in its name.  It would've been cool to see the roll made with some southwest spices rather than a traditional roll.    The Korean beef tacos were very good.  They really captured the Korean bbq flavors in the meat and i loved the pickled radish garnish on it.  The acidity cut through the garnish.",

It has taste, texture and a sense of creativity and innovation. Just a couple of hours ago my dining companions and I ordered a number of dishes and were absolutely satisfied with everything we got. So kudos for clearing the highest bar.  Here is the bad news. Service is less than mediocre. I do want to clarify: when I say service is below mediocre it reflects elements of service such as speed, accuracy and follow up. In each of these three elements our experience was not good at all even though the server was friendly and amiable.  A dining companion ordered a drink from the bar. It was a disaster not just in how long it took for the order to be filled but also in that the barkeep had no idea on how to craft the drink.  In all fairness, the staff recognized many of the missteps and offered us free dessert. We appreciated that.  However, service is a challenge and needs attention.",

Cocktails are plentiful -- the Sumo 75 was especially refreshing.   Note, they have indoor and patio dining.  While the DJ was awesome, the sound inside on a Saturday night was way too loud and so we preferred being on the patio where they have fans and misters.

The tables for two are really tiny, so when 3 menus per person and a variety of dinner ware is in front of you, there is very little room for food.    The menu is the most interesting, fusion fare I've ever see.  I enjoyed the selection. I settled in miso soup and a bowl of green tea soba noodles with okra.   They confused my miso soup order with something else and I sent it back. It took a while to get the soup. My Dad ordered the most exquisite dragon roll and a delicious, giant cup of coffee. He had to ask twice for cream and sugar.   The many pesky menus were not cleared for us until we were almost done our meals.  Our water glasses were not refilled. Just a few rookie moves need to be attended to for my rating to improve.  I would love to come back and try everything. I like the open kitchen concept.   The bar is beautiful. The large screen TVs are placed well with no volume.   The music is top 40, but low volume.   Pricing is decent. Like I said, it's a great new place, but I need a few service improvements.",

First, their website should state somewhere that the Lunch menu is not available on the weekends, we were disappointed when our only choice was the Brunch menu, which is a lot more limited.  The service was not good, server was not very attentive and pretty flighty, although the expediting staff that brought out our food from the kitchen was great and pleasant.  My brother has a big aversion to avocado, so he had ordered his sandwich without it, but it arrived with avocado in it anyway.  After flagging down a server, he sent it back and we were surprised when it came back within a minute, only to realize that the kitchen just scraped it off and sent it back to the table (there was green all over the bread. The restaurant is lucky there were no allergies.    The rest of our food was just OK, although the Shishito peppers were definitely the best part, and I will concede that the restaurant did let us order those from the lunch menu.  All in all, a disappointing experience for something i was really looking forward to, and despite the OK food, the service was bad enough that I wouldn't pick this place as somewhere I'd go back to.",

He explained all the dishes to us in great detail.  My only constructive criticism (besides the sushi) was that happy hour was only for the bar, which is a really small area.

I celebrated my 30th birthday here, my aunt's 50th birthday here, and every time someone comes in from out of town, we take them here. I have probably tried at least half of the menu at this point, and absolutely everything has been delicious, and the presentation is on point. My husband is a chef, so he's really picky, and I don't think I've ever heard him make a negative comment about anything we've had here. The decor is awesome, so trendy, and I love the outdoor spaces. The only remotely critical thing I can say is that sometimes the food or drinks come out a little slow when they're busy, but since it's all served tapas-style, you're usually not hungry for long. Plus, the server usually will warn you when certain things (particularly sushi) get backed up. LOVE SumoMaya!!!",

They did say it was the most popular drink.  The peppers off the HH menu were surprisingly good.  Chx tacos way too small. I mean tiniest portions there all together.  The $18 tuna ceviche came out and there was hardly anything to it plus it wasn't good at all.  I did eat it though because I didn't want to waste $18 ceviche but really wish I would have sent it back.  Great presentation on it.  The guacamole was good but nothing special. They do only give u 5 chips to eat it and when u ask for more they charge u.   All in all. I've heard rave reviews about this place and all of us agreed it's not worth it to go back.

It wasn't bad it's just not what I would consider good fusion food. They barely put any seafood or chicken in anyone's dishes. I don't mind spending money on great food but this food was not great it was just ok. I'm pretty sure I could do better at home. I had the Pork al pastor pad Thai is was too sweet & not a lot of flavors going on. I must say we enjoyed the deserts. The birthday boys got a flan desert with ice cream & it didn't suck! We also ordered a chocolate cake & I had some Mexican street corn that I thought was the best thing I had besides the flan, cake, & drinks. Probably won't come here again",

Their Maya rolls are great and flavorful. We made a reservation through Open Table so no wait. We were a bit early so grabbed some drinks at the bar which were also delicious. The fried rice dish was great as were the Korean tacos. Would gladly come back here any day of the week.",

Open kitchen so you can see and interact with the cooks. Wood fired grill, seasonal produce, fresh seafood.. You name it Sumo Maya has it! Great concept, great location and even better team! The bright airy interior   ginormous tree and large frosted glass windows welcome you into food lovers utopia!   Let's talk food! Sumo Maya roll to die for with its spicy tuna, crispy rice, fresh micro greens and wasabi cream drizzle! What's an Asian restaurant now a days without edamame? I'm sure that's what your thinking.. Wrong this edamame is unlike any around! They cook it on the wood fired grill gives it the smokey flavor, then lightly toss it in a miso butter! Delicious! Bacon guacamole, salmon ceviche, New York strip, muscles in a coconut lime broth!! I could go on for days but you'll never know till you try it yourself!     Do us all a favor and go check out this hot spot! Yum! I'll be back soon!   Cheers Foodies!",

    "text": "I ususally dont like suprises, but this resturant was quite a treat. My father took me and my family there for my 19th birthday and it was delicious. I was kind of not sure about an asian/mexican mix of food but this place proved me wrong. My family ordered the guacamole with bacon chunks (mind you there were many guacamole options) and the guacamole came with handmade corn tortillas that included a taste of chile lime on the top. Combined it was magnificent, I love guacamole and bacon but that tang of lime was the cherry on top. After the appetizer I ordered the Rollo Chingon, it had adobo grilled shrimp, guacamole, cilantro, jalapeno, red lotus root chips and balsamic strawberry glaze. I chose this roll becasue im very adventurous when it comes to flavors. The shrimp was grilled to perfection, the guacamole and the cilantro gave the roll a sweet taste and the red lotus chips evened it out with some saltiness but when you get some strawberry glaze on the roll (and I mean get becasue its drizzled on the plate) mixed with the soy sauce was a great mixture of sweet and salty. Then I ordered a Strawberry Gazpacho that had chilled, lump crab, marcona almonds and evoo. I have never had gazpacho but I enjoyed it, the soup was very sweet when you first slurp some but then a little spiciness hits you, im a little sensitive to spiciness but the flavors were well put together. Since it was my birthday our waiter brought out a of slice peanut butter and chocolate cream pie, now I hate peanut butter but I still ate it out of respect. I surprisingly couldn't taste the peanut butter that well, so if you love peanut butter just know you can taste it with the first bite, but the chocolate overpowers it as soon as you start to chew. All the food here was really well displayed and very good, I will definitely go back. I'd like to also comment on the actual place itself. There was live music by a cute folksy cover band, just a man and a woman im not sure if they're there all the time but they were fun. The whole place was well decorated with bright colors and picturs and asian/hispanic elderly on the back of some of the chairs was a funny touch. The atmosphere was quite casual and the staff was very nice and very attractive, that's always a bonus! So overall I give the restaurant 5 stars because of its overall excellence in taste, display, service, outlook, and originality.",

Don't make changes to your menu options too early on, when things seems to be working.  I was very disappointed this evening when I went and asked for the 5 for $5 salsa option, and was told it had been discontinued.  That was an element that distinguished your brand and makes a huge difference on the dining experience - as each sauce could bring an item to life in a different way.  I then asked the server if they had any salsa or hot sauce...she offered me Siracha.  This was fine - but to market yourself as an upscale mexican - asian fusion restaurant, and not offer any fresh made salsas is very odd.  At least offer something original in the salsa department, if you don't want to make all 5 of those sauces.  Don't take shortcuts with the clientele you are marketing to, I can assure you it will not end well here.",

    "text": "Make me smile. Aside from the 1970 classic Chicago tune (yes.... some people were actually around at that time!) these words are the ultimate compliment that I can pay to a chef and a restaurant. There are only a few places in the Valley that bring a smile to my face and relaxation to my brain. Sumo Maya is one of them. Chefs Matt Zdeb and Andy Suzuki are so incredibly skilled at what they do that even in the midst of this active atmosphere, I can take deep breaths and relax. The Kimchee Fried Rice (with firm grilled shrimp added as an option), and Arroz Con Pato have never missed a step and always provided just the right combo of all things tasty. The Crispy Calamari and the Bacon Wrapped Medjool Dates are just stupidly good.  German, Tai, Eli and Alex keep the engine purring and customers on top of their priority list. Even on this busy night (last  night, other businesses in the same area were having their own special events and parking was crowded), the smile was there. For those who have enjoyed this experience before, these observations really aren't that new. For those who have had less than a wonderful experience and especially those who have not yet been able to make the trip, I strongly recommend that you give this place a shot at earning your business and a happy face.  Peg and I smile a lot here.... Dr. B.",

The kitchen was in full view and the space was definitely utilizing the great weather of Phoenix.  Don't fret if you get a spot outside as there are numerous misters ready to cool you down.  If you do sit by the misters, expect a cool, almost tropical breeze during your meal.  Honestly, the food was pretty good.  We had the chicken tacos which were small but tasty, had the suzuki roll which was the star of the dinner, and a spicy yellow tail roll that was eehhh ok.  The fish isn't amazing but the creative rolls and the atmosphere was fantastic.  Our service was spotty.  They made efforts but they were clearly too busy.  Likely, this issue will clear up as they outgrow their growing pains.  For dessert, we had the chocolate lava cake which was yummy.  The horchata ice cream was a bit icy for our taste but was made up by the juicy cake.  Would try again as the menu was so expansive we couldn't try everything we wanted.  Good business strategy, offering numerous amounts of dishes that you have to try :)",

Service was the most challenging part of this evening and I learned from Eli the manager that they work in teams.  This was quite puzzling since we had one waitress and only one bus boy who delivered water once.  After all of the appetizers were eaten and cleared, it took over 30 minutes to deliver the main dishes and our waitress did not even know they had not been delivered. This system and the main dishes not being as good as the appetizers is why I think it is not worth the noise level, service incompetency and price.",

    "text": "First of all, I have never had anything bad as far as food goes.  The service...not so great.  I brought a friend from out of town here for lunch(the place was almost empty), considering I had been raving about the guacamole with lump crabmeat for days.  Ordered fresh tortillas to accompany...waited, and waited, and waited.  The guacamole was finished before they ever came. I was sitting on a wall and there was a huge delivery truck parked right behind me that left the engine running almost the entire meal.  It sounded like a jackhammer going off behind my head. No one really apologized, they just said he would move soon. The music was loud.  I got a headache.  My friends lunches came, and I waited, and waited, and waited some more for my soup.  They were finished before I ever received mine.  Is the food good? yes.  Is it the best in town?  No.  I suggest cruising on your 15 minutes of fame while the going is strong, because when you aren't the new, hot restaurant anymore...it's going to be time to improve on a few things.",

From the minute I walked in, customer service was MOST EXCELLENT!  Thank you Chelsea S. for being SO WONDERFUL!  I was also visited by a Manager, Alex....Again, very nice and really wanted to make sure our needs were being met.  She was also WONDERFUL!  The place was packed but we got a great spot by the bar.  I love how the patio is slightly enclosed.  Once the sun went down, this was opened.  With the combination of that and the misters, it made for a trendy cool visiting area!  Now for the food....my friends could not get over how great it was, they are foodies from great ocean areas and really loved the combo and different approach with some of the items they ordered.  I got the kimchi fried rice and I am trying to figure out when I can get back to get some more.....YUMMY!  Drinks were great, I would recommend the grapefruit beer.  So refreshing.  Atmosphere - very up to the minute, warm and welcoming.  Love the colors and the zen style and feel.  My new hang out!  Thank GOD I live close!  THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!",

Our server did a good job considering we were a large group of 14...even separating the bills without asking. I enjoyed my lunch of 3 tacos - mahi, carnitas and Korean beef and added the edamame side. The tacos are street size (small) but I didn't leave hungry. They were very flavorful and had some kick. Korean beef was my favorite. Other ladies ordered shrimp avocado salad that looked amazing. Someone got a noodle dish that I tasted and it was delicious! The only negative was 1 person in our group got served her basic salad nearly when everyone else was finished. Not sure what happened but manager came over to apologize to her.    Overall the cost was little higher than I would normally spend for a lunch but I enjoyed the food, ambience and service and would return.",

    "text": "We stopped at Sumomaya hoping to have a drink and some appetizers. We are not from the area, but had heard rave reviews of this place and it was close to our resort. We walked in on a Monday night, and they were not super busy. We like to sit at the bar, but always check in with the host just in case they seat their bar specifically (we know most places don't, but some do, so we always try to be respectful and not just blow past the host stand). The hostess was extremely rude and responded to our request to sit at the bar like we were ridiculous for saying anything to her. We sat down and there were at least 4 people working behind the bar, possibly one in training. Once sitting at the bar we were not greeted, but just handed a drink  menu and asked if we were going to order dinner. We said we weren't sure, but would like to see a menu. Then another bartender comes over and sets down some sort of placemat that were both soaking wet. We ordered a drink, which came quickly, while we looked over the menu. Maybe I was missing something, but i didn't see any sushi on the menu, I'm talking like nigiri or sashimi, which is what we were hoping for as we weren't hungry enough for rolls. I was planning to ask about that, but we finished our drink and not one of the 4 people behind the bar ever came back to check on us or see if we wanted to order anything. By this point we were both feeling uncomfortable and had decided to go. We were able to get the attention of one bartender to get our check at least. Was super bummed because we were really excited about this place!",

Once it hits dark, holy crap the douches and cougars come rolling out.  However, for a lunch spot or happy hour location, I'm a fan.  The food is fresh , unqiue, and very reasonably priced.   It's a bit confusing because it is an Asian/mesican fusion. So you can order sushi and a taco.  A bit odd at first, but just go with it.  It works somehow.    The sushi is fresh and the Mexican Pho is my go to.  The pho portion size is enormous and is more than enough for a lunch/dinner. Be sure to order the Mexican Street Corn as it is outstanding!!",

We had made a reservation via the hotel concierge, and were so excited to eat there as the menu looked unique.   We were told they could only seat us outside, it is still over 42 degrees at this hour, and that if we wanted a table inside we would have to wait over 45 minutes. When we explained that we are tourists and this is our last night of vacation and we are hardly accustomed to sitting outdoors here, he had nothing to offer other than rude remarks.    Not impressed with the lack of hospitality- especially in a town like Scottsdale where every other encounter has been pleasant and polite.",

    "text": "So I came here in September 2018 with a friend and am just posting this review now because I had a perplexing experience here (aka I needed quite a bit of time to think about whether I even wanted to write this review). There's a lot of other reviews here that are praising the service but I had a pretty awkward and underwhelming service experience. Basically, here's one of the awk conversations between my server and I:  Me: What are your favorite vegetarian options on the menu? Server: *lists off a few options that she says are the most \"popular\" Me: Ok, which one is your favorite? Server: Oh, I don't really like any of the vegetarian items. There's not many of them. Me: Ummmmm I can see like 10-15 vegetarian options? Server: Oh, it's just not a lot compared to the rest of the menu.  Can't say it feels good for a server to tell me that I'm about to blow $45+ (at a supposedly upscale restaurant) on food that she doesn't like. It was really mind blowing that she even spoke about the food this way.  The good news is that she truly undersold the food because I loved the Oaxacan guacamole. The Mexican street corn was also good, but a bit one note (pretty smoky, not as balanced in flavor). I would recommend splitting the street corn between 3-4 people. The Oaxacan Guacamole was also a large portion. I also had a passion fruit cocktail that was tasty (on the sweet side for my usual taste, but it did have passion fruit so I expected it).  Overall, the food was solid and the restaurant has an upscale ambiance. However, my friend and I were exchanging glances the whole night because our server truly confused us and made us not really want to eat here again. I typically hate writing bad service reviews, but I feel like this one was deserved. I haven't been back to this restaurant since that night, but I guess I would go again if a friend wanted to. It was a perplexing experience overall.",

The inside of the restaurant is so cool and trendy, I was in love! My friends were visiting from Minnesota, and I'm so glad I chose to bring them to this place.  The service was excellent and our waitress was really knowledgeable. My two friends are vegan, and often struggle with waiters when eating out. A lot of the time, waiters get impatient with them because of their special requests, but our waitress knew everything on the menu that was vegan and was glad to help them find something. We were pleased to find they actually have an adequate selection of vegan food. Personally, I got the yellowtail jalapeno sushi, their pomegranate guacamole, and a dessert. It was all to die for, will definitely be back!",

We also had a few hand roles and the calamari. Everything was great with the exception of the service.  The service was slow, in consistent, and they kept bringing 3 of everything even though there was 4 of us.  I would go back, but definitely would like better service.",

We were actually told that their portions are shareable but We definitely had to order a lot of food to share.  Regardless, the food was delish with so much character and flavor. I love how well the restaurant represents Mexican and Asian fusion cuisine. It's truly unique and I've never visited a place like it before. We will definitely visit again! Our service was tremendous. We never had to ask for drink refills, and it was my husbands birthday so he got a free piece of cake. Great place to eat, great service, and great atmosphere overall.",

And they had a live band!! How fun!!!  So for $29 a person, I got the blood orange mimosa. Did I tell you it's unlimited??? And you can pick an appetizer and this is unlimited too!! My husband got the yogurt, granola n fresh fruit and I got the huevos revueltos al albanil and the chef's assorted sushi rolls. Did I mention these items are unlimited so u can order as many as u want?? So exciting!! (I Iuv food!!) It was amazing!! The eggs were so buttery n fluffy I ended up getting two orders!!! Assorted sushi rolls were delicious too!! You get three diff types (2 of each kind) so 6 total. Yum!!  As my entree, I got the enchiladas suizas with a side of Chinese sausage fried rice w pineapple. These are all included in ur bottomless brunch!! Such a great deal!! And the food was amazing!!! My husband got the wagyu steak n eggs w wok fried breakfast potatoes!! I had a bite and both was perfection!!! And you get a dessert as well!! Can u say food heaven???!!! I got the bunuelos which r crispy cinnamon tortillas and my husband got the liquid cheesecake!! Both so delicious but obviously I had to take a lot of food home!!   I highly recommend this place for brunch as well as dinner. Only small hiccup was that I had to ask for salsa n hot sauce to three different people and no one brought it to me for over 15 min... so I finally just had to walk over n flag our server down.. my eggs were just staring at me (hehe) i just really wanted to eat my eggs w some hot sauce. But not a big deal since I noticed she had a huge party...   Overall, amazing food!! Super fun atmosphere!! Definitely a place to check out!!",

This post deserves a 1 star because I hope management understands this was just flat out bad. Food was good. Drinks were good. Ambiance was good.  Waitress was awful.   I've never went to a restaurant and had a waitress make me not want to order. I didn't get anything I wanted. I asked for 4 different things and every time got a snark response. If I'm buying, I expect to be able to order anything I want.... it's what I want - not what you want or think.   I felt like I wasn't at a restaurant even though I got brought food, paid and left a tip.   The waitress was off and honestly you should never do this to anymore loyal customers because that's bad for business.   I do want to note that I think she knew at the end and did a good job. But my experience at that point was determined. I wanted to have a good time and I didn't until I left.   I hope no one ever experiences this sad performance because a great place like this should not be under served.",

Then she tells the nice young hostess to sit us at a booth outside BUT THEY NEED THE TABLE CLEARED BY 11am. Our reservation was at 9am. Seriously? We have to drive for an hour to get here, and you want to rush me on my Mother's Day brunch. WOW. Mind you, the food is always great but today there was no need for you to have an attitude and tell me, \"we have several large parties booked today\". So does that make it ok for my party of four to be treated below everyone else's requests??    I maintained my smile while they pushed two tables together by our booth. I made a point to say thank you to both. I'm not upsetting myself today!   THANK GOODNESS OUR SERVER HAS A SMILE ON HER FACE. JOANNAH WAS SO NICE.

    "text": "Sumomaya is a large, trendy restaurant featuring fusion of Mexican-inspired cuisine with Asian (primarily Korean, Thai, and Japanese) influences.  We came here for lunch, but I can see how this place would be excellent for happy hour or a casual dinner.  The menu has a broad range of dishes, ranging from $4 to $140 (24-oz Tomahawk steak and jumbo half lobster). Plenty of bar seating and large TVs, so it can function as a sports bar too.  Overall, I think the flavors worked for me.  I saw folks around me ordering sushi rolls, but we mainly stuck to the hot entrees:  Pork Belly Ramen was excellent.  Super tender and flavorful pork belly, plenty of chewy noodles, and a lighter, miso-like broth that's drinkable.  It came with a soft-poached egg too. (5 stars)  The Chaufa Rice reminds me a bit like hot stone bibimbap, but with baby shrimp and spanish chorizo mixed in with rice and chipotle hoisin sauce.  The menu claimed it had crab and carnitas but I can only taste the latter.  Pretty good dish as the flavors worked, but its slightly on the sweet side. (4 stars).  Mexican Street Corn was a bowl of grilled, spicy corn kernels with some spicy mayo, cotija, and lime.  It was topped with some popcorn as a bonus. (4 stars)  Caramelized Plantains were excellent - plump, crispy outside and soft inside and really hot.  The sherry vinaigrette sauce paired well.  This side dish can be a healthy dessert (5 stars).  A solid  4.5 star bumping up to 5 stars for the fun environment and great service.",

It's a little too loud for an intimate dinner - we came for an interview dinner and had problems hearing each other - but it's definitely the right place for a night out on the town.  Our group got the \"Omakase,\" which means the chef sends you whatever food he thinks you'll like.  I started off with the Chinga Tu Maya, which was a very unique drink with black sesame-salt around the rim.  It had great flavor (not too sweet!) and went well with all our dishes.  And there were a LOT of dishes.  My favorites (and the most memorable) were the king crab guacamole, the ahi tuna tostada, the miso chilean sea bass (so buttery! probably the best out of all the dishes) and the yellowtail roll.  We unfortunately weren't sent many sushi or ceviche items.  I was disappointed in this, since I'm a huge sushi fan and really wanted to try SumoMaya's rolls.  We did get sent huge filling platters of chicken tinga tacos, rice dishes, corn, broccolini, and pad thai, and we were stuffed by the time we walked out.  Wish we could have had some more of the unique seafood dishes, though.  All in all, fun place to try out for a night.",

Customers had their winter jackets on from no warmth. Music way too loud. Great for a nightclub but not sitting down to eat and socialize. The most WORST part was the waitress. Very disrespectful in ignoring me and asking my male counterpart for EVERYTHING. Little did she know that I was paying the bill. She was more unjustified in being defensive in asking if their was something wrong. Yes, her service and respect towards me. Leslie, the manager comped everything because of her unprofessionalism. I have been in mgmt food service and owned a company with 15 corpoarate dining facilities. This waitress needs a different career.",

However, on my recent trip the food wasn't as good as I remembered it in the past and the cava they use for their mimosas was disappointing. I don't expect them to use veuve cliquot, but get something more sparkling. A good place to go to get drunk on a Sunday funday but in terms of quality they are lacking quality juice and cava. Their food is also hit and miss like I mentioned earlier. I enjoy their pomegranate guacamole and black bean hummus is interesting and works. The enchiladas suiza were decent, but the sushi roll I tried was underwhelming. Not sure why they even serve sushi, they're trying to do too much.",

There are massive televisions though no one is watching them. Also, there is a live tree growing through the floorboards.   I had the Rainbow Ceviche, which was great. Not sure where you get fresh fish in a desert, but this was damn good. After agonizing about which direction to go, I ended up with the Korean Beef Tacos and the Al Pastor Pad Thai. The tacos were incredible. They were very small, but the flavors were perfect. All the ingredients fresh and the spice on the meat was spot on. The pad thai was also quite good, but it was a bit sweet for my palate. It also didn't help that I felt compelled to eat every last bite without regard to my fullness.   All in all, this place deserved it's rating. I would recommend it to those going on a date or just looking for a fun fusion meal. Enjoy!",

One odd dish was their street corn, which tasted like a mayo mash with corn and popcorn. It was a weird texture and had a bland taste which was not appealing at all. We also got the apple salmon roll which was also not as flavorful as I had hoped, and the flavors of sweet chili sauce and apple did not go well together. We also tried the mahi mahi fish tacos and the al pastor tacos. The fish tacos were good, but the al pastor tacos were also bland and I wouldn't order them again. The tacos were also 2 for $8 but are so small and can be finished in two bites. I wouldn't come here again unless it was happy hour where the tacos are discounted. Their kimchee fried rice also just tasted like white rice, but I did enjoy the sizzling chaufa rice which came in a huge bowl with enough to share. Overall a beautiful restaurant with a wide selection, but I'd like to see improvements in their flavors.",

Food: 4/5 - we had the rainbow ceviche, tuna tostada, shishito peppers with bonito flakes, and al pastor tacos. The ceviche and tostada were by far our favorites, the flavors described in the menu were all present and they complimented each other nicely. The fish was also fresh, which makes me and my belly happy. The shishito peppers were good, but not great. The al pastor tacos were ok, but the pickled onion concealed the pineapple's flavor, which was a bit of a shame.  Service: 5/5 - I had put in the reservation that it was our anniversary. When we were greeted, they wished us a happy anniversary, which was great :) Further, our waitress was very attentive and we also got a tres leches cake for our special day with a sparkler on top. It was lovely! Atmosphere: ?/5 - I'm still not sure what to think about the place. It wasn't good or bad, it was interesting. An artificial tree in the center of the room is surrounded by one corner with aged wines, a wall with two gigantic tvs, and one wall that opens up to show the chefs making the food. Top that off with pretty loud music (not to the point of annoying), it had a lot going on.  Would I go back? Yeah!",

    "text": "Yummy Asian Mexican cuisine! We heard about SumoMaya & decided to give it a try. We loved the cocktails, my Boo got the yummy Magic Mojito ( too sweet for me). He liked it a lot. I got the Skinny margarita, it was delicious! Probably one of the better ones I've tasted. We started with appetizer of  Tacos Al Pastor, very flavorful. We shared the Mixed greens Salad, Chilean Sea Bass & a side of the miso eggplant. The Sea Bass was some of the best We ever had, it almost melted in your mouth, light & delightful. Both the eggplant & fish are cooked in Miso which is now my favorite seasoning. The salad was too tart for me, I asked for a side of the ginger dressing to try to fight the tartness. My guy had to order the Pina for dessert which had a macaron cookie, coconut ice cream, pineapple cake & a braised pineapple. All very delicious  of course I had to have a bite or two. The ice cream was light & fluffy which we enjoyed paired w/ the very sweet & gooey braised pineapple.   There are many items to choose from on the menu, sushi, ceviche, salads, soups, tacos, noodles, land & sea. Plus they have a late night menu & the brunch menu looks really great. And they offer gluten free dishes as well.   We sat outside & it was 101 at 8:00 but actually quite pleasant. They have fans & misters so we were very comfortable. Service was very good. We will return for sure.",

We all went with the Restaurant Week menu, chicken and carne asada were very good but I'd recommend the chef back off the lime in the sauce with the beef though. My wife's salmon in a soyish broth disappointed however. She eats salmon everywhere all the time including my own on the grill so she knows her some fish. So, I'd say 3 out of 4 positives. The taco apps were tasty yet small. My wife's sushi roll lacked zing, I tried it, nothing special. Rice pudding, the only dessert available, I thought was great! Aside from the fare, this place, on a Friday night, was LOUD! First you crank crappy music up real loud so you can barely tell what song it is through the  distortion. Add a dense crowd of Scottsdale guys and gals, squawking at each other over the mush of the sound system and you have a less than ideal dining experience. Some reviews call this phenomenon, energy.  It's a place where the vapid can commingle with the self-absorbed while enjoying some pretty tasty fare. SumoMaya's fusion of Latin & Asian ingredients throughout the menu is mighty impressive and would be worth a return but the crowd and the sound system were much harder to stomach.",

    "text": "Sumo Mark's stomach had to check this place out. Mayan Mark was just simply hungry. Also was looking for a new place to take some friends. Let's GO!  This is a interestingly and somewhat unusual restaurant. The outside is very plain looking while the inside is something completely different. Just look for the two large glass doors on the west side to enter the building. I had a tricky time trying to locate them. Note to self ...  Once inside the adventure begins. The decor and the layout are very cool and inviting. Really love the open kitchen concept and the crazy sick bar with the giant TV's. There is a large fake tree in the middle of the room that reminded me of an Ewok village in that Star movie.  Came here with some friends that like to try everything and share. The plates are a little bit on the small side and you can easily split several of them without trying very hard. The presentation of the dishes is stunning and create an instant photo opportunity.  We started with the Lump Crab Guacamole and ordered some extra chips. It was delicious and went nicely with their homemade Habanero Mango Sauce. Next the ladies chose the Pad Thai Al Pastor dish and went mild on the spice and also ordered some Miso Eggplant. Couldn't stop there and got a Suzuki Roll and finished off the meal with the Crispy Chicken Mole.  There wasn't anything that we did not like. Our favorites were the Pad Thai Al Pastor and the Crispy Chicken Mole. The Miso Eggplant was also very good and both my wife and her friend really did not enjoy eggplant until now.  Service was very friendly and most helpful. We easily spent an hour or more just goofing off and eating the dishes. Read a few other reviews that said it was very noisy during the dinner hours. We came during lunch and it was not very busy and the noise level was pleasantly low.  Get ready for a good time and check out your surroundings. You may even see some of your Yelp friends. Had a chance to see the lovely Ursula D and her eating companion as they left the building. I was not absolutely sure it was her until she checked in at the last moment.

We're definitely going back to try other things on the menu. They're doing a great job!",

    "text": "There were some major hits and misses with SumoMaya. If you're going to eat here, it's really important to know what to order so that you don't end up with any disappointments. My husband and I both studied the yelp reviews and our instagram feeds to help guide us, but we still ended up with some stinkers.  What was excellent: 3 of our 4 cocktails! My husband's drink combined tamarind and rye, sort of like a manhattan. I got the green magic mojito, and the combo of coconut and mint was divine. I especially loved the whipped coconut cream on top. My second cocktail was their take on Pegu Club's amazing pisco punch. The SumoMaya version was crazy good too. For food, we loved the buttery, soft eggplant dish. Even if you think you hate eggplant, you may very well like this. Good portion for the price too. My husband said his yellowtail roll was far better than any he's had in AZ. The fish was fresh and not mushy like other places.  What was pretty good: The guacamole with togarashi was a great, albeit very expensive, starter. I might start sprinkling togarashi on my guac at home now. My husband liked salmon ceviche a lot but was yearning for kumquats in every bite. With that little tweak, it would have been excellent. Cocktail number 4, the passionfruit drink with mezcal, was decent but didn't come close to the yumminess of the others.  The misses: the summer corn. So bland. I don't know why I keep ordering this type of dish because I can make awesome Mexican corn at home. I guess I keep waiting to get surprised. The sumo green roll needed a lot of help from soy and wasabi. My husband thought it was awful. His hamachi ceviche was a let down too. Just one dimensional, not much too it.  Would we come here again? Maybe with a good set of ear plugs. The restaurant was nightclub in Vegas loud at 8pm on a Thursday night. It's just too much techno to be enjoyable.",

The sushi was awful and the wasabi tasted like horseradish (dyed green) I didn't even eat it. Tacos were lacking in flavor, weren't terrible but definitely not great.  The Guacamole and Edamame had to be the best of them all. Good flavors throughout each. Loved the sauce that they give with the edamame.   Beer was cold; no complaints there.  Overall not bad, a little disappointing but I wouldn't say I'd NEVER go back.",

Sumo maya, fortunately got it right, atleast on my first visit here. I had the passion fruit sangria, bacon wrapped dates, fish taco and spicy corn. I liked the food and the drink was refreshing. I am a little confused on the use of the word fusion though, because to me the menu looked like there were mexican and asian dishes listed separately, not like I feared - i.e ceviche dumplings!   This place is really busy but the service is attentive and friendly. There is a giant tree in the middle of the room which gives it an outdoorsy feel. Great location. Parking is a little hard .   I did not get to try lots of things on the menu since I came with people who didn't eat as they had dinner plans later. So I will certainly be back with foodies to give this tapas place the attention it deserves.",

I definitely would not come back here for a meal but probably enjoying some cocktails would be fine.  The service issues started when I first arrived, 15 minutes early for a noon reservation. The restaurant was pretty empty, but there were a lot of servers, and I requested a table on the patio which has all of 4 other people. I waited for everyone else to arrive and then at noon we asked to be seated. The hostess said she just seated someone out there (nope, still 4 people) so she had to wait a little before seating us. 10 minutes later we asked to be seated again and she said if we sat inside then she could seat us immediately, so we agreed to just sitting inside. We each ordered an entree but everything came out separately. And by separately I mean 5-6 minutes apart. I get bringing food out when it's ready if people are sharing dishes, but each person ordered their own meal (salad...not shareable food) and I go out to eat so I can eat with other people. If I wanted to eat my meal by myself, I would stay home.   Then the food just wasn't very good. I got the vegetarian chopped salad (one of the very few vegetarian options available) and I just did not like it - the greens were a little too hard, the mushrooms has a bad rubbery texture, and the smoke flavor was just awful.",

I split a meal with a coworker of mine and every plate we got was better than the last.  Let me start with the lump crab guac with homemade tortillas. The crab was perfectly cooked and extremely fresh. I felt like they went into the ocean to get this crab and chopped it right out of the water. The handmade tortillas were so soft and warm and such a great pairing with the cold crab and guac.  Next we shared the pork belly ramen. I felt like I should have been in a japan. The broth was rich and the noodles were ala dente. The pork belly was fatty but that is the main reason one gets the pork belly. It was so juicy I was angered I only got 2 pieces.  We finished our meal with the duck breast served Mid Rare with pickled veggies. The Duck melted like butter in your mouth and there were hints of truffle oil on the outside.  Hands down best meal of my life.",

I have always come in a group of 4 or more and we order lots of dishes to share with the table. That is the best way to dine here because the food comes out when it is ready,not timed to all come out together. If you are each ordering your own dish and hope to eat at the same time you may be diasappointed.   I have had many differnet dishes and my favorites have been the Crispy Chicken Mole, Rock Shrimp Tempura, Shaking Beef and Filet.  There are so many dishes to chose from. The fusion flavors are so unique, like the Asian inspired seasoning on the Shaking Beef with a Cilantro Lime dipping sauce.The service is very good also, since we order many dishes, they area alwasy clearing platres and bringing new ones.  This is a very popular place with music/DJ some evenings si it is noisy. If you come early you may not have to wait for a table but if you come afte 8:00 you will most definielty have to wait.

One person in our company of 4 received his sushi rolls and tacos at 7.30 but the rest of the group didn't see food until 8PM.   - The food last night was ok. Not bad, not great. Might be because the restaurant was pretty busy.  - loud... it's loud and it gets louder as the night goes on as they have a DJ pumping out music so loud that we couldn't hear each other. It's truly obnoxious (do you really need some hipster kid pumping out thumping tunes from his MacBook air).  - our table was seated under a air conditioning unit dropping a lot of condensation- we were literally being rained on. Told our server several timed - he told us what it was and shrugged his shoulders.   - This place attracts all of the Scottsdale 30k millionaires.   Finally, Sumo Maya has to decide what it is. Is it a sports bar? (Big TVs showing college football).  Is it a restaurant? Is it a night club. I bet it's making a ton of money for the owner - that won't last long.   If you want to avoid the worst of the worst about this place - get there early.",

    "text": "I went here with about 8 girlfriends for a bachelorette party kick-off. We made reservations for 9:30pm but were not sat until about 10-:15pm. That was a little tedious but the wonderful service and food made up for the late start.   The football game I didn't want to miss was luckily displayed on one of their giant flatscreen HD TV's. I would definitely want to head back there to watch other sporting events in the future. The music was rather loud but as expected for a Saturday night at a happening spot. I don't know if their music is always that loud.   Once we were sat, our server was very attentive and fun. I wish I remembered his name! My roommate and I ordered the Sake Sangria and Passionfruit Sangria to sip on. Both sangrias were incredible!! We couldn't decide which one we liked more.  To start our meal, we shared the Crispy Pork Belly Roll. My roommate and I are huge fans of pork belly and this roll did not disappoint. Not only do we love pork belly, we love brussel sprouts, and this roll perfectly combined both things. I could have eaten a whole plate of those rolls!   Like I said, we love pork belly, so for our main dish we ordered the Pork Belly Ramen. It was equally as awesome as the roll. I would recommend it!  Unfortunately my roommate is very allergic to avocados...I know it breaks my heart too...so we were unable to order a lot of things off their menu since we were splitting. However, you better believe that means I'm going back and ordering everything with avocado at some point. However, I notified our server of her allergy and they made sure not to make her food where avocado had touched. So we had a successful evening without having to take out her epi-pen. They were very accommodating!  Can't wait to go back and try more food! I love their concept.",

    "text": "My girlfriend wanted to celebrate her 20th wedding anniversary with her girlfriends, since her husband was out of town (she didn't know he had a surprise party planned for the weekend).  She asked me for some recommendations and I sent her an e-mail with some options.  I was happy when she chose SumoMaya, because I have been wanting to try it since it opened.  She booked a table for us, and it was the day of the big monsoon.  Since my babysitter cancelled on me, I had to drive myself, so my hubby had to stay with the twins and couldn't be my designated driver.  We had a nice table at the edge of the patio area.  It was pretty covered.  The restaurant is beautiful.  I got there and most of my friends were already there.  They had their cocktails in hand so I wanted to order one.  It took a little to get service, finally I was able to order the Lemongrass cocktail.  One of our friends arrived shortly after and it took another 10 minutes for her to be able to order her drink.  Finally, we all had our drinks, some were almost done with theirs, and we were able to toast our friend on her awesome anniversary.  We wanted to order food, again our server was near, but not looking at us, so I got up and asked her name, so I could call her next time.  Whitney finally took our food order.  We got a shrimp ceviche, really spicy but delicious.  I ordered the Rollo Chingon, a fusion sushi roll with adobo marinated grilled shrimp, guacamole, cilantro, jalapeno and red lotus root chips with a balsamic strawberry glaze.  It was amazing, I could live on it.  We also had the vietnamese style \"shaking beef\", it was terrific.  The chinese style chile-crab garlic noodles were excellent also.   The rain started again and the manager told us that if we started getting wet, we could move to a table behind us.  As the rain strengthen, we could feel the droplets falling on us.  We told Whitney we were getting wet and we wanted to move, she said \"just scoot over\".  I had to get up and call the manager and he indeed told her we could have that table.  It was after 9p.m.  It is not like anyone else was coming.  Once we sat on the new table we were ready for our dessert, everyone started to wonder where Whitney went, she was just by the bar, hanging out, so I got up again and asked the manager if we had a different server for the new table, since we had been there over 15 minutes and no one came.  He said Whitney was our server.  He sent her over and we placed our dessert order and some coffee requests.   This place is great and I docked a star because of the service, my friends were so upset, that I didn't argue when they wanted to leave only 10% for service.  I will definitely go again, but I will make sure not to get Whitney as my server.",

The atmosphere was hip with great music playing.   Food/Grades: We had Mexican Shrimp Cocktail (B+), Kimchee fried rice (A), chilean sea bass (B+ ) and Pacifico-soy carne asada (A) and mussels (C).    I think Sumo-Maya is a great atmosphere with some promising creative culinary ideas.  I look forward as their menu evolves.",

    "text": "Mexican-Asian Fusion? It should not be good, right? I mean, I avoided this place for months, despite the beckoning pink sign on Scottsdale Road, because Asian food is awesome and Mexican food is awesome, but I could not imagine them being awesome together. Wow, I was wrong!   My favorite thing to get at Sumo Maya is the Pomegranate Guacamole and the Maya Roll.   The Maya Roll has tuna, crispy rice, masago, micro shiso and wasabi aioli, and it's delicious. I love how the crispy rice on the outside gives the roll a nice crunch without being deep-fried, and the wasabi aioli is very, very yummy.",

    "text": "Half hits, half misses. (And we tried a LOT of stuff.)  Hits:  -Soft shell crab roll. Beautiful presentation, wonderful flavor. The aioli was really nice, and the crab was fried to perfection.  -Bacon wrapped medjool dates. YES. MORE OF THESE. ALWAYS. -Wild mushroom tacos. So good you won't miss meat. I echo the concerns of others that they are too small for the price...but I'm willing to pay whatever you demand for more. -Miso eggplant. Delicate and creamy. Will make a believer even out of the most ardent eggplant hater. Perfect. -Green magic mojito. This blended drink danced on my taste buds, but if you don't like your drinks herbaceous, go for something else.  Neither here nor there:  -Guacamole with dried fruit. Decent guac but too much lime, needed more salt and a bit of heat, tomato, or onion flavor. At 11 bucks, it should really come with a couple extra chips instead of making you shell out for more. -Rollo Chingon. Too much guac on top, but the adobo shrimp sushi was tasty and the roll was stunning to look at. Just take some of that extra avocado topping and smear it on your lotus root chip.  -Coconut cocktail. Serviceable, but needed something to put it over the top. Couldn't really taste the lemongrass or lime.  -Valet. You gotta. Ain't no way around it.  Misses:  -Crispy pork belly roll. So aggressively salty. Could taste hardly anything it was so salty. Should have listened to some of the other reviewers on here and avoided it.  -Korean beef taco. Salt lick central. So salty you couldn't taste anything else. Really a bummer. Also not traditional Korean beef like you'd get a Korean BBQ, but shredded. -Head on giant shrimp. Shrimp is singular in this case. And dramatically overcooked. Inconsistent seasoning, with one bite rubbery shrimp and the next almost pure salt rub. The pureed garlic and halved cherry tomatoes were pretty insipid too. Don't waste your 14 bucks on one nasty shrimp.   -Nightclub atmosphere. So necessarily loud.",

The dessert were not very good either. The tres leches cake was more of a pound cake then a typical tres leches. The best part of the restaurant was the fried rice. That was truly very good with a sophisticated range of flavors.",

So you can imagine my disappointment when they say us right inside the door at what I would guess was the most poorly lit table.   At first it felt like this place couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to be. A sports bar, a techno dance bar, or a restuarant.   Our waitress Nina turned my initial impressions around. She was so friendly and upbeat and and helpful with with everything from drink selections to menu items.   We started out with rollo chignon sushi roll and the mixto classico ceviche.  Great selections to start your mouth on a delightful culinary adventure. The ingredients are fresh and the blends flavorful. We followed this up with a shishito roll, Korean tacos, pork al pastor tacos, arroz verde, and a apple salmon roll ( which was my personal favorite)  To cap the evening they provided a fun dessert plate with a sparkler!   All of this was gluten free as the birthday girl has celiac's. This restaurant is very accommodating for food allergies.  The final nightcap for me was a creamy vanilla martini that tasted like a birthday cake. Thank you Nina for making that recommendation!   I would definitely return here and recommend this place to anyone wanting to have your tastebuds explode in happiness!",

I had the soft shell crab and it had a sweet mango sauce   It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. We ordered the California roll and that was disgusting. The crab smelled like it's been sitting out for days it had a really bad fishy smell to it. We also ordered some taco and the meat was again very sweet. We had return 2 entrees.  You have Caucasian people who own the this asian/Mexican restaurant and all the chefs/cooks are Caucasian or Latino. Don't expect good sushi if your chefs/cooks are not asians. Haha",

What bothered us, the chef reportedly tasted it and said it was fine. Obviously, something happened to our dish that wasn't suppose to as all the reviews on the dish was excellent. Instead of admitting it, they tried to cover it up which just rubs me the wrong way. Things happen!...but the service is how you handle it. Manger didn't even apologize.

Really well designed space with a giant tree in the middle and clean, modern design with tricked out lighting. We were greeted welcomingly at the host stand then promptly seated at the sushi bar. At first it was a little overwhelming - I mean sushi, multiple kinds of salsa, tacos, pho - a mixed bag of asian/mexican as promised so we decided to order a course off of each menu area.  We started with the Suzuki Roll - beautiful and delicious with just the perfect amount of crunch and heat. Then we had the lump crab guacamole - with the guac itself being very tasty and well put together and the 'lump' crab being somewhat lacking for a $14 dish. Our conclusion was we'd order the guac again but skip on the crab.  Moving on we had the Mexican Pho - a tasty take on the Vietnamese classic with queso and cilantro. Yum. Along with that the mussels, some of the largest i've seen, in a green coconut & lime - terrific heavy cream sauce that didn't seem too out of the ordinary in a Mexican fusion way.  Then we ordered tacos - they were already out of Pastor so we opted for Chicken - these were tasty little morsels of goodness on some kind of fresh corn tortilla.   We were already getting full so we opted to wait to do any of the larger entree style or wok prepared items. We finished off with an Hamachi roll with slices of fresh jalapeno on top. Yumm. Overall it was a great experience and it will only get better as the staff gets into the groove of things.  BOTTOM LINE:  Get your Mexican Sushi on here! We'll definitely be back to explore the fun and diverse menu.",

I had never been to an Asian-Mexican Fusion Restaurant, so this was an entirely new experience for me. My BF and I were lucky to arrive during reverse happy hour (10pm - close) by chance, which had great deals on a selection of tacos, rolls, cocktails, beers and appetizers. We started out with a simple salmon-avocado roll for $5 from the reverse happy hour menu, the salmon tasted like silky butter and made me question the quality of my usual sushi go to spot. Next we went for the tacos (4 for $7) - the cod, mushroom, chicken and beef - all were amazing (especially the mushroom, YAY for some great veggie options). Next, I had the Rollo Chingon (adobo grilled shrimp, guacamole, cilantro, jalapeno, red lotus root chips + balsamic strawberry glaze) for $15. The Chingon was the only thing that I didn't LOVE but it was still good. Finally, my BF had the Tamarind Shrimp Wok (bamboo shoots, baby bok choy, dried shiitake mushrooms + garlic chips) for $14 which was very good.   The prices, overall, seemed very appropriate and I actually loved that the portion sizes where not too massive. The right portion sizes allowed us to order a greater variety and not inevitably overeat.   Service was very friendly and super fast. I can definitely recomend this place.",

Very cold dining as it's 69 degrees outside but cooler inside & I'm happy I wore a sweater. But with a back injury this is extremely uncomfortable that it's so chilly inside.   The Rick shrimp were taken away as we didn't like them. No questions about why we didn't eat them.   Photo of $9 tacos that took 53 min to get....needless to say we'll be stopping to eat on the way home. We don't have time to wait for more food.   Manager there but not interested in guests.

    "text": "In terms of aesthetics and atmosphere, SumoMaya is typically the type of Scottsdale establishment I avoid like the plague.  Loud crowds, loud house music, loud acoustics.  Its an introvert's nightmare (particularly for ISTJs like me if you're into Myers-Briggs).  That said, SumoMaya's unique culinary experiment is nevertheless intriguing and a curious foodie like me would be foolish to write off a place like this without having given it a shot.  Asian-Latin America fusion restaurants are nothing new in the valley (i.e. Chino Bandido and Adobo Dragon to name a few), but SumoMaya's version is distinctly upscale from other fusion creations I've been to.  After recently seeing SumoMaya featured on Check Please Arizona, I finally made the drive here for an early dinner on Sunday.  You'll find SumoMaya on the northwest corner of Scottsdale Road and Lincoln embedded in a mixed use commercial plaza.  The centerpiece of the restaurant is unquestionably the bar area which has twin big screen TVs on opposite sides with an impressive assortment of wines, beers, spirits, and sakes.  Surrounding the bar area, there's a mix of booth and high table seating that back up to windows which can be opened up to the outside as they were this evening.  I'd guess this place can cram upwards of 150 at capacity.  I grabbed one of the last seats remaining at the bar for this evening.  On a funny note, it turned out the bartenders were all wearing the same blue checkered Brooks Brothers shirt that I was (one even asked if my shift was starting soon, before I set the record straight).  Anyways, let's get to the evening's meal.  The menu here is a mix of traditional Asian and Latin American dishes plus an assortment of fusion mashups.  I can get the stand alone items anywhere so I made a point of getting as many mashups as possible for my first visit.  That included my drink, the Lychee Daisy Margarita.  Sake mixed with lemon juice, orange, and lychee (basically a tropical Chinese fruit).  A very pleasant and light cocktail with subtle palette awakening fruit notes.  For my app, it was a Sumo Roll.  I asked the bartender which of their Sumo Rolls were the best.  He recommended the Red Dragon Roll.  And this one packs a wallop.  Tuna, eel, avocado, cucumber, jalapenos, pomegranates, rice, unagi sauce (basically a thicker sweeter version of soy sauce), and a chipotle aioli.  Fantastic mix of Asian and Latin American flavors and the thick savory mix of sauces rounded out eat bite perfectly.  The spice level hit me a bit at first, but not nearly enough to take away from the quality of this dish.  For my main course, it seems like the Pork Al Pastor Pad Thai is SumoMaya 101 on a plate, so I went that direction.  Pork, egg noodles, peanuts, scallions, pickled jalapeno, bean sprouts, and tamarind fruit.  The flavors in this dish were more mellow but no less delicious.  The spice level on this one was muted, but the savoriness of the pork and the noodles were more than enough to make my taste buds happy.  I can understand why this is their best seller.  For dessert, I gave their famous Tres Leches Cake a try.  A moist cake sitting atop a bed of mangos and cream and topped with meringue.  I loved the tart element the mangos brought to the table and I'm pretty much a sucker for any meringue dessert you put in front of me.  An excellent meal all around with plenty of surprises.  Total cost for the drink, food, tax and tip came to $75.  Some items on the menu are more expensive than others (I saw a couple of Japanese Wagyu dishes that will set you back quite a bit for the indulgence), but they also have happy hour specials which can provide a reasonable meal for under $20.  Like I said, the food here is more upscale than similar Asian-Latin fusion spots in town, but in this case I mean that positively.  And those coming in the door can take comfort knowing that the two executive chefs (Lorenzo Lopez and Eiji Takase) are Latin and Asian respectively.  Their combined talents have yielded a menu full of interesting combinations you likely won't find elsewhere, making the extra money spent here worth every penny.  I may not fit in with the Scottsdale movers and shakers, but I'll happily come back to SumoMaya for a culinary adventure.",

    "text": "Very good ambiance and setup.  Trendy and uptempo. The place is roomy but it is loud.  Not a bad thing, but expect it.  Creative choices for both guacamole and ceviche.   Had the crab guac, Korean beef tacos, crab/seafood udon and shared all with mi Novia.  Also had some great saki. Ignore the pricing and have a great time. The experience and taste is very good.   Review Update:  OK, I am writing from my cell and took a few days to write this and relax a bit.  First, the food was fantastic and the server Kirsten was great. Perfect.  I downgraded a star, probably can chalk it up to annoyance, right or wrong.  See, I have been there like five or six times, so I have a sense for the place.  Planning to go with my Novia, so at like 9am I make a res for 630pm on Open Table.  I ask for a fourtop in the Open Table request box.  I understand. No guarantees, but I pick an early hour and get the reservation in early. The reasons for the request are, if you have been here, one thing we wanted to do is order a bunch all at once and graze.  Order the guacamole and ceviche and a couple of plates of tacos all at once and spread out.  As we know the portions are small but tasty.  Mainly, the request allows us to sit next to each other.  We get there. Taken to a two top.  Sit across from each other and have the dishes come out (quickly) but only room for some at a time. We explained and requested but no bueno for us. Frustrating thing was one table over was a four top with two people at it, and it just stayed two.  As many of you are, money is not the issue on a weekend at a place like this.  I end up spending a ton for good food anyway.  Like many of you, me and my better half probably spend a grand a month at great places here.  Just kinda bummed with the above.  I will upload a guerilla pic of the four top next to us...  Kirsten should get a raise though.  She was fantastic.",

We got mostly Asian food and I must say it was amazing it's like nothing you've ever tasted before. I got the spicy tuna roll and they had this different fish on top which was the best thing ever. We didn't get the Mexican food that they serve but we tried there chips that go with this really good popcorn dish and they were great. But I would recommend getting the Asian food instead because it is way better. The only thing that wasn't good was the restrooms and they clearly were not cleaned every once in a while.But overall great restaurant they make the food fresh definitely good to go there if your celebrating something because it's a bit expensive but the service is great super clean and the best food I've had in a long time.",

The service when we were seated was really really slow. But more importantly, the music was WAY too loud. I'm shocked more people don't mention that in their reviews. Maybe if more did, management would do something about this. On a positive note, the bar was very fast when we stood there getting drinks before our table was ready. Then it was downhill from there. The food was good. But again, hard to enjoy it with loud bass beats vibrating in your head.",

    "text": "So, the service, well our waitress (is waitress fine now a days- PC?) was friendly and on it. Yes it was a busy evening when my wife and some coworkers went to enjoy some Japanese/Mexican fusion after a conference in Scottsdale AZ, a.k.a posh retirement ages galore- golf golf golf, and training camps for MLB. I love sushi and Mexican food so how could this be a wrong choice? Atmosphere was nice, there was an enjoyable big tree in the middle of the restaurant that anyone with Dendrophilia would be aroused by. Friendly staff, even accepting a 18 month baby with smiles when Yelp states \"not good for children\". All this semi-positive welcoming-ness amongst the gray heads, and I am still not sure why 1 large hot sake and 2 bottles of Lucky Buddha takes 25 minutes to get after ordering drinks first off. Hmmm, maybe because time needs to run slower where I assume most locals have just a few rich years left. The so-called Mexican\\Japanese fusion was OK. Really nothing tastebud exploding for me to want to keep going back too, if I lived Scottsdale. You know, to get my weekly dose of food I can't live without. I do get it, every city has an expensive sushi place that is recommend by Uber drivers, rated high and talked well about on Yelp, but not necessarily mind blowing. I mean not to sound ageist, can the elderly taste much anyway? Just kidding, I digress. I love the old, new and in between. We all live and die, and eat and poo. Just maybe try another restaurant if you read this. The fusion-food didn't give me any life changing gasms of any kind... oh yeah the \"sizzling\" rice served in a lava bowl (never seen anything like it lol) was just burnt rice, good leftovers as my pics shows for a hangover, charcoal is good for that.",

I tried the pomegranate guacamole dip, eggs, sushi, pad Thai as an entree. I tried what everyone had as well and they were all delicious. The coconut pancake was awesome!   Our server was also super attentive as well! I was loving the whole vibe of this place as well! Can not wait to go back!",

After stopping for dinner on Monday night, the answer is really well!  The restaurant has a spiffy look from the outside and even better motif on the inside. The bar is nice and there are really big TVs. And the reception was great, even by the valet.  To compliment a few glasses of vino, we had the Rainbow Ceviche as an appetizer, delish, BTW.    We then had Pork \"Al Pastor\" Pad Thai and Grilled Jumbo Asparagus. The asparagus was also really good.    Overall - I enjoyed the food and experience.",

Bizarre on paper perhaps but it just works. They have a solid drink menu. I had the top shelf margarita. It was good but not the best I have ever had. It was the only mediocre thing I had there. I had the El Pastor Tacos and the \"Real\" California sushi roll for dinner. Both were very good. The guac to start was really solid. It's a small plate restaurant but everything was so good that there wasn't much sharing going on. Ha! Anyways, I really enjoyed it here. Highly recommend SumoMaya as a solid stop if you are in the Scottsdale area.",

The hostess was able to get us a patio table, since we thought inside was a bit noisy.  Josh was a great waiter and catered to all our needs. He explained that dishes come out as soon as the chef prepares them. We wife and I enjoyed  the tuna tostada, Mexican style corn and mole.  Our girls tried the sushi,tacos,pad Thai and calamari.

Anytime I have family or friends in town, this is the one place I make sure to bring them to.   I'm vegan, and although there aren't TONS of options for me on the brunch menu as-is, the wait staff is always very knowledgeable and happy to make alterations to menu items so I can have a great meal.  For brunch, I always get 3 or more orders of the pomegranate guacamole for the table... it's SO good. I also get the breakfast potato hash. I'm not a huge stickler about food being cooked in the same fryer as animal products, but I appreciate that they let me know that they do use the same fryer, in case I were that strict as a vegan. For my entree at brunch I always get the Pad Thai, and they are always happy to make it vegan for me, even adding tofu (YUMMM) which they cook so perfectly every time.  Usually I'm bringing non-vegans there, and even though I don't eat animal products, I absolutely love bringing people and seeing their faces light up at the sight of the beautifully plated dishes.. especially the desserts!",

So balancing food quality, the parts that weren't great, and the stiff price, I'd give it a 3.5 if I could.  The great...  We have fantastic quality fish; the bluefin and flounder were particularly great.  The kimchee fried rice was rather good, but I felt that it was lacking in kimchee.  I thought it would be more prominent.  The Wagyu sushi was exceptional...but also crazy expensive.  Yeah, I know that beef costs a lot.  It was a nice treat.  The presentation is good and our server was attentive, though oddly she didn't know what some of the fish was and had to ask someone.  Overall though it was a very good meal.  But they didn't have any fresh wasabi, which is odd for a restaurant trying to position themselves at this level of quality and decadence.  A few bits of real wasabi on the Wagyu and the bluefin would have defined decadence.  Even the basic sushi place on the corner near home has fresh wasabi on request.  I also found the tea to be really light in flavor, almost having none.  Seating is kinda iffy.  They have a variety of chairs, some are just hard plastic and metal, and very uncomfortable.  Some are padded decently.   We found it strange and annoying that the music was so loud for a weekday lunch.  We were shouting to hear each other, and I kept seeing people at other tables leaning forward to try to talk.  I liked the music choice, but it was more appropriate for late dinner than lunch.",

Gave us great suggestions, answered all our questions and left us alone to enjoy each other..  Now to the food and drinks....we each tried a signature cocktail, they were great. Appetizer: carne asada guacamole - with homemade corn chips.   Entree: 3 sushi rolls. One with lobster, one rock shrimp tempura, and a caterpillar roll.   The Mexican Asian fusion is great bc its the best of both worlds....not Mexican sushi rolls or asian guacamole.....its just great Mexican food and great Asian food - under one roof  Please take my word for it, and check it out!

This is not a place for children not sure why yelp kept asking about stroller parking etc. The cocktails looked amazing and I will be back for those next time on to the food !!! The calamari is hands down some of the best calamari I've ever had the sauce that's on it is delicious. The rolls are a decent size there's only a few suggestions I would have or a few thing for you to know before you go. None of the rolls they serve offer or have cream cheese that was odd to me personally but the Red Dragon roll was great anyhow another thing is they don't have a Las Vegas or fried type of roll. They did however say they could accommodate that and fry any roll I said no and ordered as is and was very happy. I wish they would offer some Type of HH that would make me give it a five star rating for sure then. For what o order the calamari and dragon roll with a Diet Coke was around $50 with tip. The service was wonderful by the way too next time we go which will be very soon I'm gonna have a large group of ladies. Can't wait to try more of their delicious food.",

The Avocado Salmon roll came fairly quick and you could tel it was refrigerated, the quality was below the ones you get for half the price at Fry's. the second roll, Red something was good, but nothing special. the passion fruit desert cake was tasteless.  there are far better Sushi joints in town. Never pick a place this size, no way they can make fresh rolls that will taste as they should.",

And speaking of ceviche, I had that the last time I went and literally had to cut up all of the shrimp (which was not deveined, gross) because it was literally just whole shrimp stuck in a bowl... And why they served it with a miniature side of stale popcorn I'll never know. Lol I just can't.  The decor and vibe is unique, but that's about all.

For example, I asked for water when I first got there and it took them 45 minutes to get it to me and then then another five to ask me if I was ready to order. I also felt that the my waiters were very condescending despite the long waits they had. Of note, the place was NOT busy at this time. The rest of my time there was not any better. Although the food here is fairly good, it is not worth returning for such poor service and having to stems hours on a meal mainly waiting on their staff.",

It was actually so much most of it got thrown out.

There were no tables, so we found space at a bar high-top. After waiting approximately 10 minutes without even a \"hi\", I walked to the bar to order, thinking we had missed the sign telling us to order our own drinks, and was told by the bartender that she couldn't help us since we had a bar table and we'd have to wait for our server. I began to explain we had waited for a server when she turned around while I was speaking and began talking with other employees. When we all moved from the table to the bar since we hadn't been served, the bartender finally returned and she commented \"you moved to the bar cuz no one would help you.\"  Well yah. She seemed indignant, and made us all uncomfortable placing our orders, as if we were now making her work instead of someone else. Her bartending skills were lacking, as the wine pour was small and the drinks average. I could go on, but our overall impression was that employees had no interest in helping us, let alone doing it with any kindness. This restaurant/bar seemed pretentious, and the service was virtually non-existent and rude. I will absolutely not be returning to what we had heard was a \"cool\" place, and am disappointed to know that young, influential people in Scottsdale put up with this second-class service simply because the place is touted to be trendy. Get smart and go to a restaurant where people understand the value of kind service.",

The first visit must have been some kind of fluke because both the food and service were absolutely on point here.   Food: Ceviche del dia- It had a nice acidity, tasted fresh, and was overall very good. Maya Roll- spicy tuna and crispy rice. The tuna was fresh and good quality and the crispy rice was well-balanced. It didn't taste like some crispy rice that I have had in the past where it was overly fried. We also had several nigiri sushi selections and all were fresh, high quality, and delicious.  Drinks: Thai Basil- Rum, lime, thai basil, and pineapple. Money Tamarind- Bulleit rye, tamarind, lime and ginger. Also money  Overall, very nice ambiance, food, drinks, and service. Seems like a great place to go for both happy hour and dinner. Huge thanks to Jason for this wonderful dinner.",

Unfortunately we were hungry and she is not of age yet haha so we decided to try again! I love all the lanterns outside of the restaurant. It looks really awesome, especially when they were lit up at night. I also loved the big tree inside. We walked in and were seated right away, even though it was pretty crowded. We sat at the sushi bar which I thought was cool! It was fun watching them roll the sushi.  Our waiter was nice, did a good job! I ordered a cocktail with rum and ginger beer and it was really spicy! But it was a good sized drink which was great. I just wouldn't order it with something spicy! We started off with the traditional guacamole too, which was served with sopapillas. Guac was a tad bland for my taste, but I ate it with a spoon once I ran out of sopapillas, so I can't complain. My drink and guacamole was served pretty quickly. I was debating between the mushroom tacos or the veggie sushi, went for the tacos. Tacos were absolutely fabulous, I wish I could have had more than two! Yum! My sister got kimchi noodles, and they let her substitute chicken for crab. She liked it but it was very spicy for her. It was real expensive. Everything is fresh and such, but very pricey for a poor preschool teacher like myself. But nice for a once in a while treat.",

Took our daughter who is visiting from Austin (quite the foodie-scene where she lives and even she was impressed) last night.  Waited a few minutes with an 8:45 reservation on a Friday night. The place was PACKED. Jason made a special effort to make sure this visit went well (first time, not-so-much). Started with pomegranate guacamole, which was delicious (though very few Pom seeds) and Korean beef tacos--a huge hit. Hubby's fried rice went over well and sushi was delish and fresh. Seasonal mushrooms on the side were worth the effort as we all enjoyed them. I've had the Tamarind Shrimp both times and it's time to try something else. It's good, but very rich and salty. This is a fun and hip place and I love the funky decor. Looking forward to returning and bringing friends along to share more interesting options.",

The crab guacamole was awesome along with the bacon wrapped figs and ceviche special. We ordered almost half the menu and honestly everything was good. Can't remember our waiters name but he was really knowledgeable and gave us a great experience. Definitely would come back.",

I would recommend coming and sampling off of the happy hour menu.",

    "text": "Friends and I went to the restaurant on a Saturday evening.  The food is outstanding; however, the noise level was deafening because of the volume of the music.  We finally got to the point that we stopped talking to one another because we tired of saying \"What?\"  When the server came over,  I asked for the check, forgoing dessert because we couldn't stand it any more, and she couldn't hear me!  I know that on a Saturday night a restaurant can be noisy due to the conversation levels, but lowering the music was something that was controllable.  This restaurant obviously caters to the 30ish 's or so singles crowd who started coming in to the bar after 9pm, but other patrons deserve an enjoyable dining experience.  When the crowd who wants to go to the newest \"in\" place moves on, how does Sumo Mayo expect to woo back diners who have had such a horrible experience.  The entire situation was nothing short of abusive (and expensive).  Never again.",

Seriously, the food was awesome and the service was very good. I probably won't go back, however. Now this is something I have seen in other reviews and I don't understand why the manager doesn't do something about this very fixable complaint...turn down the damn music! Why does it need to be so loud? You literally end up shouting to others at the table. One of my friends asked the hostess if they could turn it down, but we were pretty much ignored. Again, what is the point? There is no dance floor, it is definitely not a 'club' scene. Who are they trying to appeal to? Oddly enough, the music they were blasting was from the 80's. I loved the music (a sign of my age) but the twenty somethings that were there might not have. Regardless of the music genre, please turn it down!",

Food has very unique flavor combinations and all of it works! Atmosphere is loud and trendy.  One thing I don't get is the need for them to give impression of False exclusivity and demand.  The first time we were there was for an early dinner around 5:00pm.  When we walked in, we told the hostess we would like a table for two.  She didn't ask if we had a reservation, but instead insisted that the only seats available were at the sushi bar because they had so many reservations.  Fine, no problem.  However, in the hour that we were there, the majority of the tables remained empty.  They obviously make a habit of this, because a friend said the same thing happened to them.  Don't know why they feel the need to do this, but it's very annoying.",

    "text": "Our experience was contrary to some of the previous reviews.  The atmosphere was hopping and a mixed crowd.  We were on the patio where it initially was pretty comfortable considering it was 110 outside.  Unfortunately some nitwit decided that since the sun had gone down it must be cool outside so they raised the shades.  This unfortunately raised the temps to the level that I guess enough people complained and they lowered them back down, but the damage had been done.  Our waiter busted his butt to work our table of 6.  But there was definnitely disconnects between him and the rest of the staff.  It was nearly 15 minutes between the time we got the first entree and the final one.  We had wrong drinks delivered, other table's dishes placed on our table, and when you pay $25 for a few slices of carne asada and some grilled onions, you would at least expect it to be cooked to order.  Instead, rather than the medium rare I ordered, what I received was pretty much well done and had a burnt char taste to it like the grill hadn't been cleaned in a month.  At this point we were pretty much ready to leave the inferno and get the hell out of there.  Might be the place to be seen but if you're looking for cuisine, look elsewhere.",

The menu can be a bit confusing but just ask for suggestions.  We started off with the night's special ceviche which was dorado and it was amazing.  Best ceviche ever.  Small portions but that allowed us to sample many different dishes.  Another surprise dish was the miso, sugarcane sea bass.  So many great flavors in one dish.  We had the Maya roll and again that was quite tasty.  Loved the Summer Corn as well.  The popped corn gives it great texture.  Guacamole with crab was good but next time I may pass on that to save room for other dishes.  My Green Tea cocktail was refreshing and not too strong.  We had 2 desserts, the tres leche  cake and a fruit crisp with ice cream,  both very good.  We had attentive service and did not feel rushed.  As this is a tapas style place, we enjoyed ordering as we went along.  It is a little more costly but well worth the quality of food.  Can't wait to go back with friends",

They play cool background music and the place is nicely decorated with a modern feel.  We started off with some standard rolls which were good.  The salmon avocado roll was the best of the four that we ordered.  The texture was nice with the smoothness of the avocado and the salmon went down smoothly as well.  The spicy tuna yellowtail was not as good, but was a little more one-note with a little too much heat that overwhelmed the roll.  The speciaty sumo were not nearly as good, being a little flat.  The shishito roll looked really elegant with the salmon topped with slices of kiwi, but it ended up being rather flat.  I couldn't taste the kiwi at all and the peppers kind of overwhelmed the roll.  The hemachi roll was one-note as well.  There was just too much acidity.  The price was reasonable at ~ $60 for two people after tip and we both were full.",

My table ordered calamari, it was the tiniest portion I've ever seen, especially for an appetizer. It was 14$ for it and it was just very disappointing. The next thing was my coconut curry soup, very bland, and weird peppers in it that didn't go well with the soup flavors at all. Now the entrees were probably the most disappointing especially since we were told they were supposed to be \"family style\". Mine was the pork \"al pastor\" pad Thai, again with the odd peppers, I did get the biggest portion, however the flavors just weren't there and most of it was just cilantro. It was very bland and not much to it. My friend ordered the crispy chicken mole, weirdest combination of flavors ever, mole and plantain, the portion size was very very small and it was very plain as well, the flavors were like a very bland bbq sauce.. Now here's the worst thing for our whole experience, the lobster and crab \"dynamite\", first off, they serve it in the lobster shell, which is just odd and just a waste of space on the dish, second of all, there were pieces of the shell in the food, and thirdly, he had the smallest portion out of everyone, and he paid 23$ for his dish. I feel as if the portions are VERY unfair for the price, this restaraunt needs to reevaluate its dishes in flavor and presentation and I just feel like I was plain scammed out of my money for what I got.",

    "text": "Went to pre-opening.  Sensational menu of Japanese and Mexican inspired dishes, many featuring elements of both.  Two chefs, one from each tradition.  Owned by Jerman Aseo (surely spelled wrong by me), of Central Bistro and Local Bistro.  The drink menu is terrific, too.  We enjoyed bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo, crispy pork belly sushi rolls, sake and sesame Japanese eggplant, chicken mole, sliced 35 day dry aged New York strip steak, sliced over fresh mushrooms and a coconut milk sauce with roasted leeks, tuna ceviche tossed in Aji Amarillo sauce and served in a coconut placed in an ice bowl, hamachi sashimi in a mysterious green sauce garnished with micro greens, and many more.  Tried a Magic Mojito, made with frozen horchata and loads of fresh mint, and a Passion Fruit cocktail with Mescal, passion fruit juice and ginger beer in a copper mug.  Service is well trained and savvy.  Interiors are high end design, with innovations such as a green grassy perimeter fence on the patio hung with giant, framed mirrors, movable shade screens that enclose the patios while misters and massive air conditioning capacity cool both indoor and outdoor space, and a huge man made tree in the main dining area.  Exhibition kitchen.    Located in a new strip center at the northwest corner of Scottsdale Road and Lincoln Drive.  Entrees are smallish plates best shared with your table mates.  Prices ranged from $8 to $18.    Well worth a visit to experience the innovative menu and expensive buildout.  Acoustics are good, not too noisy even when full.",

The service was acceptable. I have nothing to complain about or praise.   The food was not worth the price. We didn't even finish most of our plates. I love the tapas style and trying multiple dishes. The pork belly was the only good part of the meal. We also had the guacamole with pomegranates and street corn which were alright. The pad Thai, ahi tacos, and the roll we had (had mango salsa on it) were not very good.    I will not be hurrying back to SumoMaya.",

If you choose to sit at the bar you can be seated where you can see the cooks which is an inviting appeal. Also they have a huge bar on the opposite side of the restaurant. I think the style of food is unique and delicious. Love the scene. It's a great place to get a group of friends to drink and eat.",

I was impressed by the genuine concern that Tai expressed the first time we spoke.   After returning for a second try my fiancee and I both felt that it was one of the best dining experiences we have ever had. The food and service from start to finish was fantastic!   A few highlights:  Tuna and Yellow Tail Sashimi- Great cut, fresh Pomegranate Gauc -Awesome... again!  Suzuki Roll- Delicious, sauce was amazing  ** Wild Mushroom tacos- I must say this was my favorite part of the dinner!  Shaking Beef-  This was my fiancee's favorite! The meat was super tender, flavorful and the perfect amount of spice!  Summer Corn- Light and flavorful and the popcorn on top was a fun touch.  We will definitely be returning and would highly recommend to anyone.",

I would definitely recommended reservations. The parking lot seems a bit confusing at first with all the white cones placed, but recommend taking advantage of the free parking valets.   Since we had several friends to wait for we chose multitude of different appetizers throughout the night. The Mexican corn plates were delicious,  the calamari and shrimp plates quite tasty. The plates were very small and meant to be shared. So be prepared for the yummy tacos to be just a few bites lol. I chose pork tacos and a bowl of spicy creamy Thai coconut soup and was not disappointed. Definitely worth a second visit for the good food and eye candy .",

Ask for her, she's the best with recommendations and accommodations.   I highly recommend eating here!!",

I had the eel and avocado roll and the ramen - both of which were very tasty.  My husband had the suzuki roll which he said was good, but a little on the bland side.  In terms of atmosphere, they had a DJ playing which I found to be a little loud.  I'm sure there are plenty of people who go for this type of experience, but it's just a personal opinion of mine.    The downside for us was that all of our food came out at different times.  We were a table of 6 and ordered our meals all at the same time.  Dishes began coming out of the kitchen and there was probably a 20 minute gap between the first and last dish.  I understand that they have a sushi bar and are a fusion restaurant, so likely have multiple kitchens that food will be coming from, but it was a little strange to have one person completely finished with their meal before someone else even received theirs.",

I get that it is served tapas style but then why as if you want appetizers. Warning to self - order apps then wait until almost finished before placing meal order.  I am not sure why you can only get happy hour pricing while sitting at the bar - it is too hard to have a conversation with 5 or more people sitting in a row. Only have been here a handful of times - doubtful that I would become a regular.   The only real highlight was our waitress Lucia - she was a rockstar.",

We really loved everything she suggested for us. I also  appreciate that she knew what exactly was in the dishes so we knew whether it would be something too spicy, etc.  All of our dishes came out perfectly timed. We really enjoyed the fusion of Mexican and Asian and were totally full when we left. There was a very nice crowd for early Friday evening, nice vibe!  We shall return!!

We went for brunch but they were kind enough to make something for me off the dinner menu that I'd been wanting to try. Kimchee fried rice is so good! Everyone in my party enjoyed their brunch items (short rib beni, chilaquiles, steak sandwich etc) BUT they don't have a kids menu. We had to order short stacks which was still a lot of food and pricier than normal kids food. You can't go wrong with bottomless mimosas and their juice mixer options too!",

Our waiter was very attentive and able to rattle through the menu at lightening speed. He spent a considerable amount of time talking about what to order--almost to a fault. Service is family style with a warning that if you order individual plates they may not come out together. We ordered the higher end tenderloin dish with a mushroom sauce to share. The sauce was overly salty and a few of my pieces of not chew-worthy. The salmon sushi was the best selection and enjoyed it. We tried the Pad Thai--a mistake. The noddles were slightly overcooked and the dish lacked flavor. We also had a beef dish with onions and leaks in a brown sauce that was good but not great. Overall, this is a place to be seen, especially for older singles, and to drive up in a fancy car, but not a place for True foodies.",

Saturday early afternoon. The manager Jason (Mahalo) reached out to me after my less than raving 3-star review. This time I took my  23-year-old son who has a sensitive stomach-you  could say he was the guinea pig!  SumoMaya now offers a bottomless brunch, score! (the old menu is still available-just ask). We sampled many of the different brunch choices from drinks to appetizers to desserts-it was all covered, and then some! Brunch is a lot of food- so pace yourself! There was a huge selection of drinks including very unique combos. The 3 Leches Oatmeal Brulee, pomegranate guacamole and chips, and assorted sushi rolls. The enchiladas suizas were PERFECTO! Dessert...mmmm liquid cheesecake brulee with marinated berries...need I say more? Stomachs-ok, music level tolerable, and there was no wait to be seated. Round 2 was a winner! There isn't any other restaurant quite like SumoMaya!",

Though the food was delicious, depending on what you order, portions can be a little on the small side (and yes, I do realize that some of the plates are small plates, yet the small plates were even a bit too small). Also, it's obvious that the wait staff caters to the \"beautiful\" people who flash their money and are there to be seen. For those of us who have lived in the Scottsdale area for a long time, you know how that mentality of people ruins it for the rest of us who don't fall under the \"Snottsdale\" moniker, and it's unfortunate that the snobby crowd gets the faster service and syrupy sweet attitude. I would hope to return another time for more tasty food in a bit more generous portions and hopefully some better attention from the wait staff.",

Maren, our waitress, was next level fantastic: with her beautiful hair, flower crown, and unicorn necklace, we knew we had hit the jackpot. She was on top of her game and we noticed that on top of her smaller tables, she was managing an ENORMOUS group and we always had water filled, drink orders taken, and plates of food in front of us. She was kind, friendly, gracious, funny, and above and beyond wonderful. We had had a rough weekend and she really redeemed it. Honestly, the food was spectacular, but I would have come back for Maren because she was amazing. Manager/owner: give her a raise!   We had no expectations heading to this \"bottomless brunch\". Step one: unlimited \"side plates\". Yes. Unlimited. See my pictures, but this was the BEST guacamole I've ever had in my LIFE. There were a myriad of other small plates. We tried Chef's choice Sushi: amazing; huevos revueltos--delicious; black bean hummus--get it; tres leches oatmeal-- Oh. My. Gosh, and our entrees-- Pad Thai, machaca 2 way eggs, and vegetarian scramble. Topped off with bunuelos which were covered in caramel goodness and pecans. Really everyone, there is a reason this restaurant has the reviews it does. This was the BEST brunch I've had in I can't remember when.   I want to write this with as much enthusiasm as possible because I feel honored to have had this restaurant experience and I want others to have it as well. GO. NOW.",

The food was impressive to look at, and while all the dishes had unique flavors, I only really enjoyed some of them.  Others, while having a different flavor experience, were a little too foreign for my taste buds. The Mexican Street corn was really good for me, while the chicken mole was not so much.  The Peruvian corn was also pretty generic to me.  The space is beautifully decorated, but the chairs were not as comfortable.  A few side notes, as the server pointed out.. The portions can be on the smaller side, so be prepared to order more plates if you are hungry.  Service was very good. One minor note:. Be aware there's forced valet parking.  Maybe it's because of limited spaces in the parking area, but that seemed weird to me when we first arrived.",

We arrived early and although we had to wait 15 minutes past our reservation time I'm giving them 5 stars. The atmosphere was so fun, the specialty drinks were delicious and the customer service was outstanding. With out large group we have two servers. Joanna and Sydney. They both did an amazing job. They knew we were on a time crunch and worked to move us all along quickly. They were on top of drink refills, constantly checking in with us and ensuring our experience was nothing but the best!

We will be back!   2nd visit... down to 4 stars- but not because of the food (still excellent) but the servers wearing faded black tights as if they were pants is not indicative of this caliber of restaurant (and the price). Also the ledge by our table was filthy- just an oversight. Our waitress was nice but talked almost entirely in slang & broken sentences. The food will have us back for another try.",

    "text": "I've never in my life experienced something like I did at Sumomaya last weekend with their manager, Brianna.   Let me start by saying I'm 8 months pregnant, and planned a bachelorette dinner for 14 girls. In the midst of emails back and forth, I truthfully forgot Brianna mentioned there was a $60 minimum PP. Not even a big deal, especially with a group of girls eating and drinking in celebration.   We mentioned to the server we weren't sure about the minimum, and she went and got the manager.   They made me go meet Brianna in the corner of the restaurant (yes corner) because she wouldn't come up to the table. She went through the emails and said \"I'm not sure why you're so confused it says it right here\", \"I see you're pregnant and not drinking but that's not my problem\", \"you will meet this minimum or we will just add the difference to your bill\" \"not sure why you're so confused\".....  I've worked in restaurants for years, eaten at hundreds, and never EVER in my life have I been spoken to like that from management. Brianna, if you're reading this, you should find a career where you never, ever have to converse with humans.   She then PRINTED, yes PRINTED, out the emails, highlighted the part about the minimum, and made the server deliver them to the table to the girls.   The minimum isn't even the issue at this point, $60 minimum is nothing, it's the fact that people like Brianna are employed to manager a restaurant and people. I was so embarrassed and horrified I don't think I ate a bite of food.",

    "text": "Visiting from LA for the weekend, we decided to give this place a try because of how interesting the food variety was.. I mean how could you not love Asian Mexican food.  We called in at 6pm Saturday for a same day reservation but the earliest they could take us was 10:15 which was perfect. Parking was easy and valet available. We had to wait an additional 15mins because they were very busy but the host was very kind to update us frequently!  The restaurant is very beautiful and everyone dressed up here like it's a club or something. It definitely felt like a club scene because they have a live DJ and the music is hip and loud.   We ordered 4 different sushi rolls which were all good and what you would expect of them. The garlic edamame was so delicious! Our party loved it so much. The Mexican street corn was to die for! From the wok, we ordered the Chinese Sausage and Pinapple fried rice which seemed to be lacking in sausage and flavor. The kimchee fried rice was a hit though and highly recommended. The chicken mole was good and their take on Pad Thai was surprisingly delicious as well.  We celebrated a Birthday and a 'military coming home' celebration and they surprised us with 2 desserts with awesome fireworks!  Overall we had a really great time here and our server Victoria was so great with service and getting us everything we needed. Keep up the great work !  Would highly recommend to everyone. Especially young adults. Not really for a couple looking for a quiet night out.",

    "text": "Ohhh this place... I'm in love. But seriously this is my dream fusion restaurant. I tend to stray towards Mexican and Asian cuisine, so what better than a fusion of the two in one place. I was nervous at first honestly because really this could go reallllllly good, or it could go extremely bad... but they seem to have figured out the perfect balance.  For an appetizer I started with the A5 wagyu meat stone ($40). Honestly, yeah... its expensive for an appetizer buuuut its also A5 wagyu. Ohh, and it's also worth it. My gosh it was so good. Super tender, fun experience cooking it on the hot stone, and it came with 3 sauces and seasonings I believe. I remember truffle because I love all things truffle. We also ordered the salmon hand roll, rock shrimp, bacon wrapped dates and the chaufa rice. My least favorite was the hand roll and not because it was bad by any means but because everything else was sooo good. I think we ordered a lot of things packed full of flavor and it was a hard transition back. It would have been better to start with. For drinks, I tried the mayan mule, Pisco sour, breakaway, and sake-it-to-me... then a normal gin and tonic with cucumber (delicious). Also, I tried my friends drinks.. I definitely didn't order that many :) Some were a little sweet for my taste but all definitely had great flavors.  Overall this was a fantastic experience! I definitely want to come back!",

Upon arriving, I was impressed with the decor and Scottsdale vibe of the place.   We were placed at a table outside on the patio. My friends and i were looking forward to catching up as we hadn't seen each other in a while but promptly found out that it was next to impossible as the music was way to loud. I had to shout so the person next to me could hear what I was saying and had to ask her to repeat herself several times.   When the waitress came around to take our drink orders, I asked her for recommendations. She did a great job of asking me questions to get a feel for what types of drinks I liked. She recommended the breakaway. I thought it tasted like cough medicine and would not recommend this drink.  For dinner, I ordered the chicken tacos. These tacos were sooo good! The flavors were on point! My only complaint with regards to the food was that the portions were so small. Running at $8 for 2 tiny tacos (no sides included), I expected more for what I actually got.   When all was said and done, our waitress split the bill for each person. One girl got an appetizer on her bill that wasn't hers and a few other people had drinks and food mixed up which messed with expected total of the tab.   I was disappointed with my experience at SumoMaya. The music was far too loud and the portions were very small. Overall, the best part about the place was complaining about it.",

We went for brunch and the mimosas were delicious but the food entrees were extremely small and the steak and egg dish I had (probably 2 oz of steak and one poached egg) was cold and flavorless. We even ordered 3 sides to share between the 3 of us and were still all starving afterwards. The wok potatoes were good but definitely did not seem made to order/fresh and were room temperature. I was very disappointed as I heard only great things about this place.",

They look the time to acknowledge my issue and concern and wanted the opportunity to make it right by comping a brunch. I have to say the second time around service was very up to par, the food was delish and it definitely won back our business. I cannot stress enough how awesome it was for a business to actually apply the constructive criticism in a positive manner. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family :)",

Less toppings and more of the deep rich flavor from the broth and the seared pork belly would have been better.   I see why people like the Korean Beef tacos. Although the taste of the pickled veggies was way too overpowering and the individual flavors of the beef and most importantly the lack of a Kimchee taste. Don't get me wrong it's a good taco but when I make Korean BBQ beef and kimchee I like to taste the flavors and in combination. I'd call this more of a pickled taco than a Korean beef taco. Although tasting the beef on its own (which is delicious) you really don't get that taste when you eat the whole thing together which is a shame.",

I started with the Rocky Shrimp Tempura, and was astounded by the eclectic flavors swimming around in my mouth. The pomegranate guacamole only added to this deliciousness! Then, I had the miso soup, which was a little salty, but who isn't a little salty these days?! And I miss the ocean, so it worked perfectly.   My entree was the miso sea bass, which I adored. Came with great sauce! I also ordered a side of Peruvian corn, which I would not suggest. (A little too much salt can kill all of the fish in the ocean if you know what I mean.)   For dessert, I had the chocolate sticky cake. Delicious! And my friend Bartholomew (visiting town from the Pacific) had a white Mexican cake that brought him back to his roots.  The atmosphere was pleasant and agreeable, with a funny and attentive waiter, good music, and a football game on in the background. Every plate arrived decked out with leaves or flowers, which only added to the appeal. Additionally, our waiter brought us fish tacos as a special treat because the chef made extra! How lovely!   Tl; dr: I want to eat ALL OF IT!! And you should too!",

SumoMayo is pretty good for Asian/Mexican food, but definitely not the best in either category by itself. It's great to have all the options so I would come here again with a group or for work, but would opt for pure sushi or pure Mexican joints for a date night. Appetizers were great and so were the guacs and fried rices, though they were on the sweet side. Food kept coming out as it was ready, which is great when with a group. The servers were not great about filling waters, but otherwise were sufficient, though I would expect better service for the prices. I did love the open walls and the plants that were part of the walls!",

Our server I unfortunately do not remember his name, blonde hair neatly trimmed beard was probably the best server I have ever had in Scottsdale, one friend I was with said the last time she was there she had him as a server and he was great then too.  Decor? Modern comfortable and I always like a large indoor tree no matter where I am.  We started with the pomegranate guacamole (I love fruit and I love food, I don't like it mixed together) BUT it was easy to separate and delicious good fresh ingredients.  Rock shrimp tempura so good (sweeter than I remember) but still good.  My ONLY complaint is my entree Chaufa Rice, presentation is amazing served in a what resembled a molcajete with a base ( it looked like a stone martini glass) with a sunny side egg on top; However the rice was very salty and It probably had 4 small shrimp /3 small pieces of chorizo and maybe two or three small pieces of crab.  The service kept getting better and better we never wanted for anything even though our server had several other large tables he handled everything personally.  He brought out a cornucopia of small pieces of cake with salted Carmel ice cream and a sparkler for my friends birthday.  I am terrible with names  next time I come I want to make sure he is our server !",

I had a problem when I called the restaurant to see if I can change the time. They didn't find the reservation and when I gave her my last name spelling she rudely told me that she is aware how to spell it. The worst was when they told me that I had called the restaurant the day before (Friday around 1230) and cancelled my res. When I told them that was definitely not me she argued with me that \"yes you spoke with someone to cancel yesterday.\" Excuse me but I know if I spoke with someone to cancel something and the fact that she was (according to her) \"the one in charge of the brunches\" made it worse. What kind of people do you put in charge? Ones that accuse patrons of lying ? Then even after we changed our res from 1215 pm to 9 am I logged into open table and all a sudden there was a res available at 1215 for 7 people. yet you said you couldn't find my reservation? Worst service from management .",

I went to SumoMaya over a year ago and had not went back as I have just been trying new places. I went back tonight, and am going to make it a monthly routine to go back! SumoMaya has high energy and music on the weekends, the servers are attentive and don't leave you hanging, valet is offered for free, and let's not forget the food is outstanding. One of the only places I can think of in old town Scottsdale where you can order guacamole and chips, and order sushi at the same time. For anyone that doesn't know, it is a Mexican - Asian infusion restaurant. You get the best of both worlds when it comes to food while hanging out in a well decorated and positive atmosphere. I would suggest not bringing children as it's not an adult only environment, however, you may have a better time! I highly recommend trying SumoMaya whether it be for a date, friend outing, business event, or even by yourself. (Sit at the bar if you are solo, it's a great time!)",

    "text": "Bartender: Presley Imbibes: house hot sake (unexpectedly and unannouncedly expensive at $17 for a carafe)  Eats: Thai coconut soup, Peruvian corn, crispy chicken mole  Brilliantly conceived mash-up Central/South American and Asian restaurant with a gorgeous interior.   Service was attentive. There was a small snafu regarding a taste of an IPA that took an exceptional amount of time to arrive, particularly given the fact that I was sitting at the bar. But I was in no hurry, and the service was cheery and chatty. Excellent work, Presley.  The food was quite good. The Thai coconut soup was a standout. I love anything lemongrass and coconut, lime and coconut, lemon and coconut, a little bit of heat. You get the idea. This was hotter than most, but was really quite divine. The Peruvian corn was surprising and although simple was fun to munch through. The crispy chicken mole was just right, enough heat and chocolate without being overbearing.  $17 for a wee carafe of hot house sake is just a little bit crazy singing to me. I didn't see mention of house sake anywhere, so I asked. One would think that at that price point for the price would have been fertilized somehow. It was the only downside to what was otherwise an interesting, fun, engaging experience.  I'd come back here. And I'd hold the sake.",

I have to admit I was skeptical due to the fact that these food genres couldn't be more different. I was pleasantly surprised with all the different options on the menu that made both of our tastebuds happy! The plates are small and perfect for sharing. We had several sushi rolls, tacos, a shrimp dish, and a few other things that were all delicious. The sushi was great and the Mexican food was too! The atmosphere is very cool and perfect to watch a game or have a romantic evening out. The only con I have is that it's pretty pricey for the small portions.   I would definitely recommend it!",

There are not enough superlatives in the English language to describe the taste and quality of the food.  The service was excellent.  Our waitress Danielle was so friendly, knowledgable of the menu, conscientious of dietary restrictions, and generally good at her job.  We spoke to the general manager, who took an active interest in our experience.  Definitely one of the best meals I've had in the Phoenix area.  We'll be back the next time we're in town.

We thought she was doing this to greet us but she was really doing this to scream to her friends coming in after us. She didn't even say hello to us or acknowledge us. Okay fine. Then she's so busy still chatting up her friends that we were standing and waiting for her to ask us how many were in our party. Finally, after almost 15 minutes of waiting for her to finish, she begrudgingly took us to our table. No apologies for waiting or anything. We sit at a table and wait and wait and wait. We are very, very patient. Finally, a server comes to take our drink order and we ask for the menu. Then wait and wait some more. He brings the drinks over but doesn't take our food order. He also has an attitude meaning no pleasantries or even a smile! A new server comes along and takes our food order with no attitude. He checked on us and he was pleasant. But after all the waiting and the bad attitudes, we will never go back again. The food is only mediocre so it's not worth paying to have bitchy employees ruin your evening.",

She acted annoyed that we walked in.  Asked if we were there for happy hour or dinner.  We said it was our first time in and were not sure.  She shoved one happy hour menu at us, told us where to sit for happy hour or dinner and turned her back to us.  Did NOT seat us.  And her job is what?  Wait staff was indifferent.  I ordered a cocktail, I am not a bartender and I make a better drink.  It was awful.  We ordered dinners and our food did not come out together I had to ask where my friends dinner was.  I had the Tamarind Shrimp.  Way too much sauce and salt.  Vegetables were non-existent and there were only 3 shrimp.  The best part of the dish was the white rice.  YIKES.  My friend had the \"Crispy\" Pork Belly Roll.  I had a piece.  \"crispy\" NO.  Sweet and sour plums (? where), chicharron, brussel sprout \"coleslaw\" (? again, where), plum wine sauce (a smattering).  So disappointing.  Will not go back and my friend felt so bad because it was her pick.",

The main dining room layout has an open kitchen, which can be entertaining but can be a downfall if you recognize your food sitting on the counter waiting to be served to your table. Happily, the service was exceptional!  About the food itself: We ordered sushi, the mussel bowl, the soft-shell crab BTL, and the tacos al pastor. Here's the thing-- the presentation is gorgeous. But the food is lacking where it counts the most. EVERYTHING WAS BLAND! Granted, the sushi was tasty and well priced. A $65 bill was unjustified, in my opinion. I've heard people rave about this place for months and I honestly cannot see why. Maybe it's because it is located in Scottsdale and the concept of a Japanese-Mexican fusion restaurant sounds new and exciting. When I heard people talking about it, I said, \"Oh! Like Chino Bandido?\" And the response I got was a snarky, \"No. This place is not ghetto.\" Well, maybe I'm more attuned to a lower-class lifestyle. I would have rather gone to Chino Bandido.",

I made reservations on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpentable.com&s=e2215de09505b8fbf3a047b68af38708cbc8b52c843ab34faaecc46b3704d557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Opentable.com</a> for 630p. A nice girl called me earlier in the day to confirm my reservation which I thought was very nice - for a Monday night reservation...I would highly reccomend making a reservation because it is a new restaurant in Scottsdale (also near Paradise Valley) which tends to draw a lot of dinner guests. It was packed last night and we left at 830pm. The restauant sits on Scottsdale Rd but you enter from the other side where there seems to be a moderate amount of parking. For some reason. Of course there are 'those' lamborginis and/or ferarris that just cant park in the normal parking spots but dont be fooled by those - its just scottsdale/paradise valley. The amibiance is great with bright colors a nice center bar and table seating both in and outdoors. We sat inside near the 2 huge TV's hanging over the bar. At first I thought the TVs were going to be distracting but actually they blended in even though you couldnt miss them.  We had a great waiter but didnt catch his name. He reccomended the guacamole with crab which was amazing. We also ordered the Tuna Tacos, rock shrimp, pork belly roll and chilean sea bass skewers. They were ALL awesome :) They offer very interesting items with a lot of great flavor combinations. I do think it is a little expensive. The skewers were $12 and you git six small pieces of fish - but on the bright side it was so tasty you forget about the price.  For dessert we ordered the Tres Leche Cake and OMG - to die for!!! There is a marshmallow crust on top that is lightly browned and a chocolate rice crispy treat to balance out the flavors. It really was one of the best desserts I have ever had.  I will definately return in the future. I did notice some snobby patrons but arent they everywhere? I have nothing bad to say about SumoMaya - great new restaurant and I am excited to plan another trip back.",

We sat at the bar, seats were very comfortable (cushioned) and they have big screen projection tv's.   The vibe here is very laid-back yet spunky and vibrant! I can see coming here for a Saturday/Sunday brunch with family and friends.  Also for any big game whether it's football or basketball-I can see this place filling up quick with sport fanatics. It has different dynamics to complement different personalities and with that being said this place is definitely an original restaurant that is one of it's kind.",

The service is good but not excellent. There were times where I had to wait about 15-20 minutes or so before getting any water or menus. The food comes out individually whenever it's done so that is a plus! I absolutely love their charred edamame, sea bass ceviche (I don't think it's on their menu anymore but they should really bring it back!) and sumo-rita. The sumorita is served frozen but you can request for it to be on the rocks. Also, if you are a guacamole lover, try their guacamole! They have two or three different ones and they are all delicious!  As for parking, if you come early enough, you can park right outside in one of the unmarked spots. But if you come during dinner time when they are the busiest, you would have to find your own parking elsewhere or use their complimentary valet parking. I've been here before when the valet was full and it was very inconvenient.",

    "text": "After getting use to how reasonable many of the restaurants were in AZ in comparison to the Bay Area, SumoMaya is one of the pricier options we tried but I knew I was in for a treat when I walked in to the sounds of the islands since the manager is from Hawai`i.  Although Yelp hours have them listed as being open from lunch through dinner, I did notice they have an hour break where they close between I believe 3-4PM.  Luckily we made it there in time for a late lunch.    Admittedly I was so hungry that I did not get a chance to really savor the individual ingredients (apparently that was Brussel Sprout slaw on top) in the crispy pork belly roll as I practically inhaled it.  What I did taste was very good and the slaw does lighten up what could've been a heavy option.    The good thing is after I satisfied those hunger pains, I did get a chance to slowly enjoy my choice of 3 tacos with veggie side which I felt was the best value if you want to try different flavors and in itself would've been enough to satisfy you for lunch as long as you did not come in starving.  Wanting a variety, I got the al pastor (pork), Korean beef, and battered cod tacos with a good sized side of Mexican corn.  The Mexican corn had a nice creaminess to the taste that was nicely offset by the crunch of the popcorn on the top (I do suggest moving the popcorn to your plate when you get it to avoid sogginess).  Out of the tacos, my favorite was the al pastor due to the flavor combination of grilled pineapple, avocado, and pickled red onions that highlighted the pork beautifully, followed by the Korean beef with pickled veggies, with the cod being my least favorite of the 3 as I felt it was too bland for me.    If you get the mahi adobo, make sure to add rice for $2 as the protein itself is on the small side and you need the rice to make use of all the great flavors from the sauce.  The chicken mole with plantains came with a small scoop of rice so was a heartier option and really hits multiple taste buds with this dish, from the sweetness of the plantains to the savoriness of the chicken to the slight but mildly spicy punch of the mole sauce.    Overall, they did a wonderful job in fusing the Mexican and Asian flavors together.",

Now combining Latin America cuisine with Asian food may sound a little odd at first, but trust me, this place is great!  We went here the other day for our office Christmas lunch and had a great time. There were six of us and between us we tried the following items: guacamole with pomegranate, street tacos, Chinese-style chili crab garlic noodles, Mexican pho, Mexican street corn, the steak pepito sandwich, and the lobster and crab \"dynamite\".   Everyone enjoyed their food immensely and the service was great, with the waiter answering all our questions and doing an excellent job of adjusting the heaters and the wind shades so that everyone was comfortable. For dessert, we decided to split three items, the tres leche cake, chocolate peanut butter bar, and the chocolate sticky cake.  My only regret is that there were so many other items on the menu that I wanted to try and no one else wanted to order the ceviche, but I guess that just means I have an excuse to go back... and I definitely plan to do that. In fact, I may need to make several visits to get my fill of this place :-)",

Seared perfectly, deliciously salty/sweet, delicate yet portioned generously enough for hearty appetites.   Next, the king crab guacamole is amazing. An absolutely delicious appetizer served with fresh-made corn tostada shells, and large enough for our party of four to really enjoy. The tempura popcorn shrimp with pickled red and green jalepeno was outstanding as well.  The only reason I hold back on five stars was due to the beef dish and the panko lobster dish. The beef bites were chewy, not tender, served on a bed of water cress and onions, onions, onions. Red onion, and stalks of green onion. The onions were far too many, and undercooked, almost raw. Way too potent for intimate conversation. The stuffed panko lobster... Anyone can chop up lobster meat and mix it with sriracha sauce. 'nuff said.  Speaking of intimate conversation. You definitely will get close to your date at Sumomaya; it's the only way you'll hear each other. And this was a Sunday night, their quietest night. Still, it's a great place for a date, just maybe not a first date, and make sure she's a little adventurous! Sumomaya is culinary experience.",

We went with another couple to celebrate a few April's bdays. 3 of us got our entrees at about the same time but the 4th person had to wait a bit longer. We even had to mention it again to the waiter to see why it was taking so long. Once we did get the last entree we had to send it back. The \"it's not that spicy\" was WAY TO SPICY.    The big surprise was when we got our check. We paid 29.00 for an entree and when the waiter asked if she wanted rice, neglected to tell us that fried rice was an additional 8.00?? Say what? Sorry but that's just a bit much for an already overpriced entree.   Lastly, I asked that my entree be boxed so that I could take it home and instead, it was thrown out. They did the right thing and took it off our tab. They said they'd make it again but it was the missing entree earlier and we were ready to go.   Just not a good visit this time and there's plenty more restaurants out there to give a try so I think this will be our last trip for some time.  The food is way too pricey for what you get. I think they've got some work to do.",

I will go there with my friends for happy hour and grab a snack, and I've also taken foodie clients there for a business meal. My only warning is that you have to be careful if you were entertaining guests as it can be a bit noisy, crowded, and with often slow service. But this is just because it is a very cool and hip spot... unfortunately, this is the only reason it's getting four and not five stars.  How can you not go wrong with an Asian and Mexican mix of food! I know it sounds strange, but some of the food combinations are simply amazing. For something as simple as guacamole, there is this some of the best that I've had, particularly the pomegranate guacamole option. It may sound a bit strange, but trust me it's a very subtle and unexpected twist on a classic...And the hand fried whole tortillas are extra crunchy and amazing!  We ended up ordering about 10 or 12 entrees to share on my last visit, so I don't want to name them all but the kimchi fried rice, Chilean Seabass, and some of the noodle options are simply outstanding. Of everything I've eaten there, there's not a single thing that I wouldn't order again.  And please don't stop at the food... Be sure to get drinks! The cocktail menu is phenomenal as well. If you happen to be visiting on a hot day, be sure to try the blended mojito. It's one of the most refreshing and delicious drinks I've ever had...just maybe save it for dessert as it is quite sweet. There are a ton of other drinks on the menu that are worth having before you get to that one.",

She was humiliated and embarrassed. I understand the need for laws, especially when preventing under age drinking, but she is of legal drinking age..... And she was with her mother, for heaven's sake! It ruined what had been a wonderful evening, celebrating the New Year.

    "text": "5 of my friends and I decided to have brunch here Sunday, after reading a New Times review that was pretty positive. Apparently the New Times didn't go for brunch. We arrived early-9am, as we were cycling over and wanted to avoid the heat. We sat outside on the patio, which was nice, aside from the vinyl cushions. Why anyone would use vinyl cushions outside in Arizona is beyond me. Our server, Jorge, seemed nice, although his accent was a bit of a challenge. That mostly just resulted in my asking him to repeat himself, and feeling like an ass.  When he took our order, it was very disorganized. There were only 6 of us, and he asked me three times what I wanted to drink. It took 15 minutes to get our drinks - 3 Bloody Mary's and 3 mimosas. It seemed a little excessive. After bringing us our drinks and waiting another 15 minutes, he finally took our food order. I was only asked for my entree twice, which was a slight improvement over my drink order, but 3 of us were asked multiple times, which seemed odd. Our drinks were empty by that point and we requested refills. We did, after all, order unlimited drinks. That took about 10 minutes. We couldn't figure out why, we were the only people there, aside from other employees. We ordered bacon guacamole and crab guacamole to start with, and we received 6 chips for 6 people. Now they were big, but really?! The guacamole was tasty but the consistency was AWFUL. It was not creamy at all, it felt like a bunch of diced avocado and spices. I wish I'd taken a photo. Our entrees arrived about 15 minutes after the guacamole, which was fine, but my food wasn't hot, or even warm. Lukewarm, maybe. It was still decent, but if it had been hot I think it would have been wonderful. The eggs were poached perfectly, which was impressive, given how often they are overdone. After our food was delivered, we waited maybe 20 minutes for another drink refill. We also had been without water most if the time, I think I asked three times. Why he didn't leave a pitcher, I don't understand. After our plates had been cleared, the check was promptly delivered. We requested separate checks, and he said the best he could do was split it evenly between the 6 of us. At this point we were so annoyed we said fine. We planned on staying and relaxing a bit with a few drinks, but when we asked for more, he said \"oh, I don't think I can do that since I closed the check\". Somehow he made it work, but wow what a thing for a server to say. We never had asked for the check! The most disappointing part of the meal was the outright passive aggressiveness Jorge displayed after one of our group wrote up a quick Yelp review at the table. She asked for something, and he said, very bitterly, \"Of course, Kristina\". She was the only person who paid with cash, so we immediately knew how he knew her name (again, only people in the restaurant). We were all pretty appalled at that. The manager stopped by to let us know he saw the review, and he was quite nice, but it didn't really make up for the terrible service. As much as this place has great potential (the food could have been amazing, if only it was hot), the service ruined my experience and I probably won't return.",

First of all there is a tree in the middle of the restaurant and they were playing the original godzilla- who wouldn't love that?! The food is served family style and meant for sharing and our server did an amazing job of explaining everything and his recommendations were spot on. We had 5 dishes - The Crab Guacamole, Calamari, Korean Beef Tacos, Shaking Beef, and Kimchi Fried rice with shrimp. All of it was great! If we went back we would probably leave out the Crab Guacamole, not because it wasn't good, just that everything else was amazing and we were stuffed! The Korean beef tacos were out of this world! It had the most amazing flavor and the crispy pickled veggies on top of the beef was the perfect flavor addition! We could have these everyday! We will definitely be back and can't wait to try more",

The presentation, flavor, and delivery of the food were spectacular. The ambience was enjoyable. They have a giant faux tree in the middle of the restaurant. They did a great creating the Asian/Mexican fusion and knocked the quality of food out of the ballpark!! To top it off the valet was complimentary. We did not try any desserts. The restaurant is still new and they are working out the kinks on the service side. We will go again!",

    "text": "I always like to start with the good so I will say that this place offers great people watching and the gawking factor definitely gets high marks. If you are looking to drink cocktails and view the work of Scottsdale's finest plastic surgeons, this is the place for you. If you are expecting a nice restaurant, not so much.   We arrived at the restaurant and it appeared that there was only valet parking available. At first we were ignored, but were finally informed that valet parking was closed. However, it was open to the BMW behind us. Thankfully we were not driving an old car or they might have called the police to remove our apparent poorness from the parking lot.   We stepped inside the restaurant where the DJ stands next to the host. Apparently this is a warning that loud techno music will inhibit patrons' ability to have a conversation. I told the host that we had a reservation for 7:30 pm and he said that it was for 6 pm and they couldn't hold the table that long. There was some back and forth here as I explained that someone from our party received a confirmation call from the restaurant earlier that day for the reservation we had for 7:30. In the end, the host was only a little condescending and that could be my fault because I didn't get the memo about this being a \"dress-up\" kind of restaurant and arrived wearing business casual.   After about a 30 minute wait, we were seated at a table so small that four of us were seated on the corners and we were so close to the bar behind us that every time a server walked by we all got bumped. Our server arrived to take our drink order and we, all 10 of us, were trying to get a look at the cocktail menu. We asked for an additional cocktail menu but were told there were no more.   Our entrees arrived one at a time and every food and drink item was delivered by a server standing at the head of the table and yelling \"Who ordered the___!!\" That was fantastic as we must have ordered 40 things between drinks, appetizers, and entrees. Considering the price of the food, I think I can reasonably expect the wait staff to remember to which position the food should be delivered.   As for the food itself, some things were good, like the tacos and the rock shrimp. Some things were really bad, like the ramen and the chicken mole. The portions were small, but this was expected.   There are some really fantastic restaurants in Scottsdale where you can get awesome food and excellent service. Also, you can generally get a viewing of the same beautiful people just about anywhere in Scottsdale. Go to the places where you can get the 3-in-1.",

    "text": "Please close down.  Reservation at 7:30 on the patio.  Got there on time.  Finally seated at 8:00 inside.  Way too noisy for a restaurant.  Actually this is a bar trying to be a restaurant.  Manager offered complementary guacamole, which was actually added to the bill.    We moved from inside to the patio at 8:30 and then finally served at 9:00.  2 of the 4 meals came out at the same time, then another 10 minutes later, then another 10 minutes after that.  Waitress tells the table that food comes out when the chef finishes making it.  Not necessarily at the same time.  Got out of there at 10:00.  What a disaster.  Food as okay but not great.  Kind of a gitchy idea of combining Asian and Mexican but only okay.  Service was lousy.  Really really really lousy.  No idea of how to take care of customers.    If you like a bar setting with really huge tv's then this may be your place.  As for the food, 2 of the 4 people thought it was good. 1 was way too bland.  The dish was some sushi thing with raspberry sauce.  Nearly puked it was so bad.  The other not so good dish would have been okay had it not taken nearly 45 minutes to arrive.  The inside is nicely decorated.  But more like a pick up bar than a restaurant.  Too many plastic faces standing around waiting to be recognized.  More like L.A. than Scottsdale.    Wait staff need to be trained.  Don't have a clue about how to treat customers.    To top it off, woke up with a huge migraine which I never get.  I can only think they use some crap in their food like MSG or something.    Prices too high for what it is.  So many other good places worth the money, not this place.  Please stop embarrassing Scottsdale with this attempt at fusion of Asian and Mexican.",

    "text": "The food tasted good - but the dining experience and service left a lot to be desired.  I went to Sumo Maya last night for the first time. I was invited out to meet a fiend for her B-day. When we got there at about 8:15pm the place was packed and thumpin' like a night club. Wall to wall people and barely an inch to squeeze by.   We found our group seated at a large table, they had already been there since 6:00pm and had been eating and drinking all night, so I had some catching up to do. Couldn't find the waitress or waiter - whoever was looking after our table for 20 minutes, so I fought my way upstream to the bar where I squeezed in and out of people at my attempt to get a drink. As expected the bar was slammed and everyone working there was super busy and it was next to impossible to get a drink order in. Finally got the attention of a bartender and I got my drinks rater quickly after I was able to place the order.   Went back to my table of friends and joined in the fun. I was starving and wanted to order some food. About 40 minutes in a waitress finally showed herself only because two friends at my table grabbed her because they needed to tab out and leave early. I asked if I could order and she came over once she was available. My fiance ordered the Pad Thai Pastor and I ordered the Braised Pork Belly. This is where it got awkward....  I understand busy and when restaurants are busy all you can do is wait, I am fine with that, more drinks for me! - If you could get an order in. I was excited to see that Sumo Maya is so popular, which could only mean one thing...Sumo Maya was doing something right and must be worth the wait. So wait I did.  About 30 minutes later my fiances Pad Thai came, a server - not our waitress delivered it and placed it at our table, so naturally he waited for my order to come. When it was clear that my order was nowhere and most certainly not on its way - I asked him to start eating so that his didn't go cold. I waited, I waited, and I waited....He finished his meal and I finally found our waitress and asked where my order was and she informed me that the food comes out as it is completed in the \"free-flowing kitchen\". This meant nothing to me except that it lends itself to an awkward dating experience when one person has their food and the other does not. I understand appetizers coming at random times to a table, but not so much something that was ordered as a entree.  The menu did state \"Our unique free-form dining style is designed to heighten and arouse your senses.\" and not having dined at Sumo Maya before and the waitress didn't ask if we were familiar with the way in which their \"free-flowing kitchen\" works, I did not understand what Sumo Maya's \"unique dining style\" was. I thought that this disclaimer on the menu was just a fancy way of saying that everything is a-la-carte and tastes good. Not, you get it when you get it and waiting while your date finishes their entire meal and you just watch them eat is part of the heightened senses experience.  The music was so loud inside that it was next to impossible to have any conversations with anyone from our group. So while I awkwardly sat and waited for my meal all I could do was sit there and smile and watch my fiance eat his dinner. It was so darn awkward....no food, no conversation and no drinks.  A little insight from the staff when ordering would have been wonderful and probably would have prevented an awkward situation. If you go there on a date, don't expect to be fed at the same time. The portions are very small but tasty. We were both still hungry after we finished the small portion controlled meals and there was no way we were going to make a second attempt at ordering more food...so we left hungry and went on to have a real dinner somewhere else.   This place is fun and cute but probably more of a pick-up joint and drinking place than a serious restaurant. Only good for apps and drinks, if you can get them! Also...bring earplugs cause it is louder than being front row at a concert. Good Luck!",

Plus add ten dollars and you get bottomless drinks as well, as long as you stick with the same drink the whole time. I went for the prickly pear mimosa and definitely took advantage of being bottomless. The price includes bottomless appetizers, sides, and dessert for the table, as well as one entree per person. We went down the menu in order to get a taste of everything. You can skip some appetizers, such a yogurt and fruit, for the more unqiue bites like pomegranate seeds guacamole and black bean hummus. Our waitress was very attentive and filled out drinks often. The entrees were hard to choose from, they all sounded amazing.  I went with the steak and eggs and was not disappointed. The bottomless brunch was an amazing experience and worth it in everyway. We went at 9 AM and the place was empty, but was completely full by the time we left at 11.

You literally could order as much as you want and drink as much as you like based on their bottomless drink options for only $10 extra.  To top it off each person at the table is also able to order their own entree from a pretty large list. Everything ordered was amazing.   The service was great from start to finish. Called ahead and made a reservation because it can get busy. Our server was great and was able to keep up with our orders... I don't think we stopped ordering food, well at least that's how it felt. For example, I think we ordered about 3 rounds of desserts.  So if you're planning to visiting for Bottomless Brunch just have fun and enjoy all the food options, it's so worth it.",

Their cocktail menu is so fancy. Lychee Cocotini and Pimms Cup stood out for us!! I went there with my girls to celebrate bachelorette which we all that was an ideal spot as the restaurant has an amazing lounge kind of vibe.  I would definitely recommend making a reservation in advance.  My only complain was during my reservation the manager/server had specified that our table will be nicely decorated with flowers before our arrival but when we got there we just got seated to a normal table. We understood it was a busy night so they must have not got a chance to set up.   Everything else was perfect!",

The confusing part was the decor (faces on the chairs?) and the \"family style\" dishes the wait staff really pushed but the dishes are all for small parties (of 2). We were a party of 7 and dishes were delivered to the person who ordered rather than in a family style manner.  Aside from that, the food was really tasty and those cautious about the strange fusion will pleasantly enjoy the dishes.",

I've been here maybe 2-3 times for dinner and each time, the place was packed - which is always a good sign! Yesterday, I was able to experience the brunch menu with some new friends and I thoroughly enjoyed all the offerings. For $29pp, there are unlimited shared plates, unlimited sides and 1 entree. Oh and there is dessert included in that price too!   We tried basically everything they had for shared plates except for the oatmeal. My favorites had to be the pomegranate guacamole and the black bean hummus! I could totally go for more of that hummus right now.   For sides, I believe we had the chinese sausage fried rice and the breakfast potatoes. I actually really like the side of fried rice - I had 2 servings of it. We did not enjoy the potatoes - they were a bit overcooked.  I decided on the Korean Fried Chicken Torta for my entree. It was an interesting flavor - good but not great. I wish the chicken was crunchy. I liked the presentation though! The bread used for the sandwich was underwhelming so I ended up just scraping the chicken out and ate the rest of it with the fried rice. Left the bread on the side and saved those calories for dessert!  There were 2 desserts - a cinnamon crisp and liquid cheesecake. My recommendation would be to eat those two items together. I left stuffed to the brim but would definitely visit again for brunch. I've enjoyed my previous experiences -just know that you'll be spending a bit more here to get full during dinner as portions are small. Looking forward to coming back to try more!",

The decor is amazing--a tree in the middle of the dining area, the acrylic clear chairs, the lounge and bar area...it's all really trendy and beautiful. I came here on a whim on a Sunday evening. I had the banana margarita which was unique and amazing. I had more of a craving for Mexican rather than Asian, so I went with ceviche as an appetizer and it was the mix ceviche with beets...soooo good! I then ordered the Korean beef tacos (AMAZING), the al pastor (even MORE AMAZING), and the street corn--even better! It was so good, the flavors, the texture, the unique ingredients--I truly enjoyed the food. I definitely can't wait to come back and try some sushi and noodles the next time.",

The atmosphere in this place was fun, funky, lots of people and crowd watching, very busy and a place to \"see and be seen.\" The music was hip and our servers were are fantastic.   We got the Rainbow Ceviche, and it was divine. Tuna, salmon, hamachi, white soy, citrus and jalapeno. The flavor combinations were bursting in my mouth. I would get that every time I go there. (And they also have take out, so I would order two of them if I were in a hurry or wanted to stay home.)  Then we got the Spicy Crab Roll. That roll was a flavor fest in my mouth. Glazed crab, Japanese chili threads and passion fruit sauce. OMG. That roll is one of the best I've had in my life. (And that's a pretty bold statement-I eat a LOT of sushi.)   And finally we got the Yellowtail Jalapeno Roll. It was pretty darn good, but the first two dishes stole the show.   Our cocktails were excellent made. I had a Grey Goose martini, slightly dirty and my friend got a Kamikaze on the rocks. Perfect!   All in all, I can't wait to go back here! I do want to try the Billionaire Roll, but I didn't want to plunk down $50 for a roll without trying their other dishes first. But I now know that is the next thing I will be trying!!",

The food was good (nothing to rave over) except the edamame - which was delicious! The sushi roll I think called Suzuki roll (has the dried rice on the outside of the roll) I personally did not enjoy the crunchy texture with each bite (and I usually like tempura rolls but this one was very different). I would not order it again.   I really enjoyed how all of the food was plated - I thought they were presented beautifully! The reason for a 4 star was because the food was okay and the restrooms were dirty & one of the women's stalls was out of toilet paper. Please do better at having someone check these out.",

    "text": "Loved this place. Came here for brunch. Its a very hip Mexican/ Asian fusion spot. They feature outside private patio seating for your small party events. There is traditional seating inside, by the sushi bar and where the main chefs cook.  My party and I ordered the kim chi fried rice, pork al pastor pad thai, carne asada scramble, foie gras & eel roll, rainbow roll liquid cheesecake and bunuelos. We loved the kim chi friend rice, foie gras roll and the pad thai. The combination of Mexican and Asian flavors was delicious. They do feature this Billionaire roll with gold flake and wagyu.   Food and service here was great. This place got really packed right after 11 AM. They feature a very creative menu that is very innovative. I'll definitely be back for dinner to try their other dishes. If your here visiting like myself this is a must go restaurant.",

Busy buzz interior with a hip and trendy feel. Tapas style and yet they also have big entrees.  I always order way too much every time.  Started woth coconut curry soup which is phenomenal and definitely has a kick to it.  Guacamole with pomegranite is fantastic. The bacon wrapped dates were a little too sweet instead of sweet and salty I think because the dates were too big and dominated.  The fried plantains were also very sweet and we probably shouldn't have ordered them as they didn't go with the meal but my girlfriend likes them.  Pad Thai was a miss so skip that but the foie gras and unagi roll was to die for.  Just melts in your mouth!  Kinchee fried rice is so good and that's coming from a Korean!  We ordered more rolls and all were good.  The dessert sampler for 40$ is a must. Beautiful presentation and delicious flavors.",

I thought a Mexican/Asian tapas restaurant was going to be a bunch of overpriced small plates that leave me stopping for a burger after dinner.  I also was not expecting the ambiance--the place is pretty electric, a mass of staff activity with great warmth and attention to detail, vibrant conversation, music and visual appeal. But the food:  As a group of 4, we just started ordering a few dishes and kept going until we decided it was time to stop.  Not too little, and certainly not a bunch of leftovers.  With this type of meal, everyone is guaranteed to get what they want.  The guacamole, in about 5 different flavours are amazing. The rock shrimp was a table favourite.  Even when we got to desert, I asked them to add the salted caramel ice cream from one desert to another, the rice pudding.  That was an amazing pairing, and I suspect it will make it on the menu.  At the end, we were definitely full, and the bill with libations came out to a pleasing $50 a head.  It's a win!",

    "text": "I decided to come into sumo maya for my 25th birthday to enjoy their bottomless brunch because they have a smoking deal for it. The only reason this review is getting more than zero stars is because the food is quality and our waiters tried their best to make it a good experience..but a little too late after the experience went sour.  I made a reservation a week in advance for 12:30 in the afternoon for 16 people. The hostess said that it wouldn't be a problem as long as we were okay with the patio. I explained that I wasn't too keen on sitting on a patio in 115 degree weather in Arizona in the dead of summer. Her response was \"it's a covered patio with fans and misters, and it's pretty cool since it's all enclosed\". So I agreed since she convinced me.   We arrive at 12:25. We were told that the people sitting at our table were paying out and that we would be sitting down shortly. At 12:40 we asked how much longer since we now had 16 people blocking the entry way. They said \"they're setting your table now\". I had my friend ask again at 12:50, and we were told the manager was trying to get the people that sat before us at our table to get up so they can reset...weren't we just told it was being reset? Finally the GM came over to apologize now that we are standing in the doorway for 30 minutes after we had a reservation! The hostess' should have planned their floor better.   When we finally sit down, it is STAGNANT. No breeze, misters are blowing the other direction of the restaurant, and now while we're supposed to be celebrating my birthday, everyone is nauseous and irritated from the heat. They were either understaffed or still don't have this whole \"bottomless brunch\" down yet. For 16 people, they were bringing out 2 dishes at a time. We each had 2 bites every 15 minutes and we were starving. I finally pulled the waiter aside and said we need to speed up this process and we need our entree order taken. He was clearly very busy and couldn't refill our bottomless mimosas in time, nor take our order in a timely matter. I had 4 mimosas in a 4 hour time frame when it was supposed to be \"bottomless\". Towards the end, we were so hot we didn't even ask anyone and just sat down inside at a random table. So much for it being a \"cool\" environment.   Overall, the restaurant was extremely unprepared for a busy brunch rush on a Sunday which is unacceptable being in Scottsdale, and given the clientele that they bring in. Not once were we offered any compensation for the inconvenience or the lack of service we were being given. It was just apology after apology. We definitely will not come back if it's more than 2 people, if we come back at all. They have a lot of work to do.",

As the crowd poured in the two bartenders were far too few to accommodate the demand. Multiple attempts to order food were dismissed.  I ordered the spicy crab noodles which came with one very small piece of crab atop.  The bar tender immediately agreed this was too little. Apparently the kitchen wasn't impressed and did nothing despite me speaking up. After waiting another 20 minutes to order dessert or more food, we asked for our check and left ASAP. Cool atmosphere but would not go back.",

Oh But Yes you are it's Scottsdale AZ !  Asian and Latin Faces are sprinkled on some of the seats and a big really Real Looking tree is planted in the dining room. The Beautiful Restaurant was also pristine clean like a hospital.  Our waiter was very welcoming and explained the menu to us. The food is Asian Mexican Fusion and is TAPAS Style meaning you share small plates and do need to order 2 - 3 plates a person even at lunch time.  We started with the Korean Beef Tacos and the Miso Eggplant. Both were delicious and oh so delicate I think someone must have very good eye sight and used tweezers to add all the tiny delicate flowers and micro veggies in the right places on both these dishes. The Eggplant is a must get dish, it's creamy eggplant flesh that's slightly sweet and laced with miso and sake and also  adorned with sesame seeds. I would say the same about the Tacos  that are just as delicate and are also highly detailed and ARE DELICIOUS. But I do think they should up the price a few dollars and give you more tacos because my photo doesn't show you how small they really are. They are smaller than street tacos and you only get two to share. They were delicious and delicate but they were only a very small taste as they are only two bites at the most.  We also shared the Crispy Chicken Mole, another must get dish. Like everything else the presentation of the food was EXQUISITE! The dish was made with really moist delicious Chicken and Sweet Plantains and pickled red onions to cut the richness of the mole. It wasn't big on crisp but was really oh so delicious and I sure wouldn't mind getting it again.  For lunch this was more of a splurge but this is the kind of place when you want something special and different. I thought dinner prices were reasonable as they didn't differ so much from lunch.  I don't know if everything on the menu is as delicious as what I tried but sure will come back again to find out!  The only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars are the tacos as interesting and delicious as they were. They were smaller than street tacos and you only got two for $7.00. For me I think either the tacos should become slightly bigger or they should up the price a few dollars and give you four tacos to share.  I note everything else I tried seemed in line with what it should cost.  Service was very welcoming and very efficient.   I can't wait to try this place out for dinner!  4.5 Stars",

The bar area was pretty busy and we found seats at the hi-top table. We ordered the crab guacamole, sushi rolls, shishito peppers, and the bacon wrapped dates. The only dish I would come back for is the guac.... But for the price I'd rather go elsewhere. The sushi was okay buy nothing to come back for.  Would I come back here you ask??

This place has a few kinks to work out, as it is opening day, first seating, but it has some serious potential. The managers/ owners graciously allowed me to try a few of their cocktails on the house and all were tasty. The clear standout is the frozen coconut mojito! Extremely delicious. I also had the coconut drink, which was very pure in coconut flavor and the passionfruit drink (10$ normal price, 8$ hh) which was gingery and smokey and overall unlike anything i have had before. Plus this place has hard a on tap... Cool stuff. For food we Trued the following:  dates wrapped in bacon - very tasty... How could it not be? It's a date with cheese and chorizo inside and wrapped in bacon on top of a foie gras sauce.... Come on!  chicken tacos- very flavorful but tiny... I would like more for sure!  traditional guac- flavorful and plentiful, but served with weird tostada type chips... Good tasting and clearly house made, but awkward to eat.  pollo chcharrones- so yummy with the  miso mustard... Nicely done!  this place is a definite return to place, reasonable prices, good drinks, nice hh, and interesting food (not to mention cute decor).   check it out yelpers!  ps, first!!",

Food was a good mix of interesting and different flavors. The size is smaller (almost like tapas) so it is easier to try numerous menu items. Pricing is moderate. A bit pricy for some items but def nothing outrageous.    The staff was friendly and attentive, though that may be because we arrived shortly after they opened for the day. Didn't have to contend with too many other customers at the time which was a huge bonus.  Seeing as the restaurant is new, there were a few execution issues I noticed with our meal. The sea bass was overly seasoned and I kept looking for something to help cut the saltiness. The garnishes on the plate didn't help much in that respect. The overall flavor and concept of the dish was nice though. Def would try again.Their sushi was beautifully presented but wasn't rolled (or packed, since the pieces were square) very tightly. It often fell apart as we tried to pick them up. Aside for these couple of items, it was a nice experience.  HH daily so I'll def be back.",

    "text": "This restaurant was an absolute delight on our recent trip to Scottsdale, last Saturday. We arrived @ 6pm without a reservation but scored a seat at the bar overlooking the kitchen. Turned out to be the best seat in the house! Luckily, our son who's confined to a power wheelchair, was able to pull up to the end next to the fixed seats where my husband & I sat. We started with the pomegranate guacamole & bacon wrapped medjool dates (AMAZING dates!, the very BEST thing I ate). Both, I'd most definitely order again. Our son ordered a drink that was right up my alley, a green 'magic' mojito. YUM!!! Had I not been driving, I would have ordered one, too! We also wanted to try the Korean beef taco. Typically there are only 2 tacos per order, but our server, Nina (who was very friendly), offered to add another so we could each have our own.Good call! For our mains, we ordered & shared the miso chilean sea bass, the pork \"al pastor\" pad thai and the shaking beef. All were delicious! Everything on the menu looks good. We truly delighted in having a front row seats to watch the cooks turn out such mouthwatering dishes. After we finished, we were most certainly thinking about trying the tres leeches cake which we had been enthralled by watching the chef make several times before our eyes. What precision! Low & behold, as we were waiting for dessert menus to be delivered, we were presented that very same dessert (fire candle & all!) to enjoy, on the house! We were SO blown away by such a kind gesture! Thank you for making our dining experience & our last night on vacation such a pleasurable experience! Our only regret was having to fly home early the next morning & not being able to try their brunch. SumoMaya, we'll be back!",

    "text": "The food was excellent. I was with a group of seven and I was able to try a myriad of dishes. Having been to several fusion restaurants some of the flavors overlap and the intent is lost due to the fact that I get the impression that the chef's are jacks of all trades and masters of none. This was definitely not the case here. The food was outstanding. Fantastic tacos and our group shared several of the rice dishes. We started with the edamame and the rocky shrimp. Usually rocky shrimp is not very good but having had it once where it was outstanding I try it every time I eat a place for the first time that features it on the menu. It was really good. I have to say the thing that was most impressive was the Oaxaca Old Fashioned.  The bartender who made this drink achieved perfection. Literally this was one of the best cocktails I have ever had. The only draw back was that our service was pretty horrendous. Maybe because I was seated on the patio with my group. I noticed the servers inside seemed much more attentive. We waited quite awhile to order the drinks and appetizers. Then there was quite a bit of time where our glasses were empty and we waited to order our meal. Maybe my frustration was expounded due to the fact I really wanted more of the aforementioned cocktail. I had to check myself that I wasn't being impatient by asking my wife if she noticed the lengthy gaps in server visits. It was confirmed by a general consensus of the majority of the table. We did order desert and were forced to admire it while we waited a good five minutes to get utensils to eat it with as they had promptly bused our table we were left with only our hands. They definitely were pretty. I would more than likely recommend this place as the food was pretty damn good. Maybe our server was having a bad night, however shorting me cocktails is usually a recipe for a bad review.",

They're smaller street tacos, but honestly two tacos and a shared app is plenty to hold me over for a couple hours.  The guac is good (no cheese please), mushroom taco, cod taco, calamari is really different and the few pieces I had were great.  I tried their spicy yellowtail on this last visit and have no complaints.  The drinks are $2 off during hh, so not a stellar deal there, but to be fair all their cocktails have fresh ingredients and are made with attention to detail. Its not just a pre-mix pour.  The Green Tea cocktail was great, as was the Grapefruit mojito.  One caveat to hh is that it is limited to the bar area ... which is fine if its not summer in Phx.  =/  This means if you get there after 430pm, you're pretty much stuck on the patio in the heat.  There are misters and fans, and screens for shade, but its still a solid 90 degrees out there.  If you want HH in the summer, get there early, or prepare to be warm.",

Club kids comparing notes about the prior night on the town and a sushi chef comparing different rolls to the size of his, and his coworkers penis. His co worker is the shorter but fatter roll in case you were interested.  I'd rather just have a server that pays attention.    Food is a cool idea of fusing Mexican and Asian but the execution falls way short and diminishes the concept. Why put two great things together if they outcome is going to be sub-par?  Kind of what like Martin Sheen would say.     Had a bagel with lox fusion concept that was just a straight up mess on the plate. Somehow it remained boring even though It was complicated and overdone.  In the end it's a gimmick and doesn't have legs. Scottsdale people will think it's awesome for about another year and they'll come up with a new fad for you.   I say go somewhere else.",

I am HUGE on respect and manners, so I will not be back here again. Not to mention, the $16 meal I ordered that was supposed to consist of octopus, shrimp, crab, and calamari was literally 5 quarter size pieces of seafood with some sauce and maybe 1/6 a cup of beet and a glob of pickled daikon. I wouldn't even get full from that as a snack.. We had an $80 meal that barely got us over our stomach pains.",

The chopped salad had interesting ingredients and was pretty good but a bit bland. The pad thai had great flavors but suffered from way too much sauce. We had toffee cake dessert that was exceptional.  Overall it was interesting and I might try it again.",

    "text": "My company hosted our holiday party here a couple weeks back. The food was great, but the service was lacking in a few key areas:   A) I'd been working with the event manager for three weeks and when I showed up the servers were offering people Sumo's full menu instead of the 'closed bar' choices on the pre-printed menus on the tables. This could have cost thousands.   B) Because Sumo does not offer centerpieces, one of our staff  members took the time to make them over the weekend, and dropped them off ahead of the event. They were intended for the party's attendees, (employees). Some of Sumo's employees took these centerpieces without asking, a couple took off with them. All this happened before the party was over.   C) After your company drops 4K on a party you kind of expect some exceptional or at least decent customer service right? Welp... not so much. The founder of the company took a few of the company's Bus Dev team members to the bar at Sumo (five feet away from our tables), and tried to order Fireball shots for them. The bartender retorted with a yippy \"we only serve drinks for grownups here\".  In general this place has a cool atmosphere and a fun,eclectic menu (all delish), but may be growing a little too quickly for its \"britches\". Not sure I'd host another event here, but definitely a fun spot to take a foodie friend or significant other who likes hip and doesn't mind a little yuppy.",

However, I think this is part of the \"hip\" factor (although I can't be sure because I'm not hip). Also, some of the tables have plastic chairs which are both uncomfortable and look tacky too. Food-wise, I was not a huge fan of the asparagus because it was swimming in what tasted like eel sauce.Lastly, my steak was VERY expensive and not as good as it's price would have one expect. Now onto the good-I started with the seabass ceviche and it was dynamite! I love ceviche and it was one of the best I've had in a long while. We also ordered the lump crab guacamole which was also very good. What really earned the fourth star for me, though, was the service-our server Jessica M. was fabulous! The place was packed yet she still stopped by to check on us frequently. Also, my dad can be a very needy customer, but Jessica handled all of his eccentric requests with warmth and a smile. The bar manager even accommodated us far more than I would have expected him too. Everyone who works there obviously cares a great deal about the business and it shows!",

    "text": "This place has been a long time coming, and I'm glad to see it's finally open.  We had a quick dinner at the bar last night, and the food is so good that I want to write a quick review.    It's a cool restaurant physically, although the high ceilings kill a bit of the intimacy, and probably costs them a fortune in air conditioning.  We sat at the bar, which is large and comfortable, and ordered our dinner there.    There were a LOT of people working behind the bar.  I didn't count, but it looked like they were tripping over one another.  Our bartender was very nice, even replacing a drink I didn't like that I ordered from the cocktail menu.  But the service isn't completely dialed in at Sumo yet.  For instance, I ordered the FABULOUS mushroom tacos, but a server brought over chicken tacos.  I told him it was wrong, and instead of taking them back to the kitchen, he got in a bit of an argument with our bartender, and our bartender showed him our ticket twice because he seemed to want someone to blame.  It was an unnecessary conversation in front of a guest, and he should've simply apologized and brought the right dish.  This was all on the server, not our bartender.    Every food item we ordered was splendid.  I had the tacos, my wife ordered the Kimchi fried rice, and we had the traditional guac.  We ordered some garbanzo beans, too, but somehow they didn't get into the computer, but we didn't finish the guac, so it was no huge loss.  We are vegetarians, and we were very happy with the wide variety offered to veggie customers.  My only complaint is that you get a ton of guac and too little of the bread for dipping, which is another $1.  I can afford another dollar, but it seems cheap on the restaurant's part, but that's a small complaint for what was a great meal.  For drinks I ordered the top two items on the cocktail menu: a five spice rum drink and a coconut drink.  I didn't find either remarkable, but I'm willing to keep going down the menu on future visits.   The crowd is pretty typical Scottsdale, which is generally a turnoff for me and I tend to stay on my home turf in central Phoenix, but I'll venture down Lincoln Rd and sneak in again soon.",

The salsa assortment was delicious and it is worth getting the tostada for chips as they do not come with the sampling. This is a tapas place, come to share and come to eat! Tried everything from the sushi to the Korean tacos to the bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates and all was wonderful. The only item that fell flat was the tacos el pastor, those get a solid 'meh'.",

    "text": "I opened with the korean beef taco. The kimchee was a nice touch as a topping but the beef was more brisket than korean beef. Still a decent taco. 2.5/5 (minus point for semi-False advertising).   Being a New Orleans native, I was instantly drawn to the Mexican Pho dish, as I am a Pho-holic back home. Decided to give it a whirl and I am so glad I did. While the only thing pho'ish is the cilantro, rice noodles and lime, it tied amazingly well with the soup. Only thing keeping this from being 5/5 is I would have the preferred the soup to be a bit thinner. It is a very thick soup. 4/5  Service was very good, restaurant is trendy and whimsical, and the music selection was fun, though a bit loud, even for lunch.",

HOWEVER I must warn everyone to SAVE YOUR RECEIPT because my credit card was up charged after a recent visit. I called  SumoMaya and they took down my number and then had someone from the management company call me. I was unable to answer when she called (on Friday) so she said she would call me on Monday. I never received another call. I was only charged $5 more than I should've been so I wasn't going to waste time out of my day over 5 bucks. The only reason I called in the first place was because of principle. The server had added and additional $5 to her tip after I had already left her over 20%. I do not appreciate the dishonesty of the server but will be a returning customer due to the outstanding food.",

    "text": "I am going to start with a WOW!!! I was completely blown away with this Restaurant. I am not easy to please. That being said, let's get to the food. My family tried several dishes; the Shishito Peppers, Chile Crab Garlic Noodles, Crispy Calamari, Shishito Roll, Maya Roll, and the Chilean Sea Bass.  Everything was prepared and/or cooked perfectly. The two things that stood out was the Calamari and the Sea Bass. The game changer for the Calamari was the sauce and the salad it sat on top of. I could have that everyday. The Sea Bass was cooked to perfection. I've eaten fish at a lot of Restaurants and this is the best I have ever tasted. My only complaint is that I wish there was more of it. There was only two small skewers with two cubes of fish on each. They also use REAL crab in all their dishes, even the sushi rolls. Besides the food, the decor itself is very fun and bright and suites its theme. My family was there with my 4 month old around 5:30pm on a Saturday. Already at that time the places was hoppin'. I recommend making reservations.  The wait staff was very accommodating and super friendly. We and sat on the patio and we were glad because the inside was very loud and a little cramp. The patio is very nice and misters are very good. If you do bring a baby, they do have highchairs, but no place to change a diaper in the restroom.Other then that minuscule detail, I can't wait to try more items on the menu.",

We tried two different desserts, the key lime pie and a peanut butter mousse cake. Both desserts were delicious. We sat at the bar and the chef stopped over to say hello to us and ask how everything was. A manager also stopped by and checked on us. Overall it was a perfect dinner outing!

The popcorn is a nice touch and perfect snack.  Each time we've had the happy hour menu available as they do a daily reverse happy hour in addition to a daily regular happy hour. The drinks are a little pricey but delicious.   I had the shrimp for dinner in a chimichurri sauce with tomatoes and Serrano peppers. Amazing! I did expect more than two shrimp, but they are huge and it was surprisingly filling. I definitely recommend getting an appetizer.    The bartenders started cleaning up at 11 pm and didn't ask us if we wanted another drink...instead they took our glasses and didn't say a word. I was a bartender so I totally understand the concept of cleaning up early, but I always ask for a last call beforehand.   My boyfriend and I had only had one drink each at this point. We finally ordered another drink but after we ended up leaving and going to another bar because of this, otherwise we would have stayed.   Other than that, I love this place and we will definitely be back soon!",

This is tuna covered with a coconut reduction, and then placed inside a coconut with shredded coconut on the bottom. Comes with a wedge of lime and crispy plantains. I first ate the tuna without the lime, and there was a nice sweetness to the tuna, but adding the lime later on gave the tuna the classic ceviche taste! Highly recommended.  Next was the Korean Beef tacos with grilled pineapples. The sweet pineapples and pickled onions was a perfect contrast to the Korean beef tacos. Add the avocado and you have a creamy taco with lots of flavor.  The final frontier, dessert! There is no dessert menu, it was provided verbally. When I heard the dessert, I knew that was the one. She said \"Churro Cheesecake\"! The cheesecake itself seems to have a hint of cinnamon added, and then pieces of churro was added on top, then sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar to make it complete. Comes with a side of vanilla ice cream. Makes me with there was more pieces of churro but that was plenty of sugar already.  Fantastic meal with surprise parings, there menu has a lot more to offer, I just tried the items that appealed to me!",

The tortillas that accompanies were warm and fresh out of the kitchen. We all three ordered the Sea Bass which was really tasty, fresh and flavorful. Sides included the Mexican Street Corn (good), Peruvian Cord (OK) and Grilled Brocollini (simple and great).

    "text": "We were very excited to come to this restaurant for dinner. We are from California and decided to check out a good trendy restaurant while we were in town to celebrate my husbands birthday.  We made reservations days in advance so when we came to dinner we expected to have a nice table, but that was not the case. We were seated in the patio area where it was very dark. Mind you, there were SEVERAL empty tables inside where we could have been seated. We ordered our drinks and browsed through the menu for about 20 minutes and still noticed all of the empty tables inside. We asked if we could be seated inside where the ambiance was different than the patio where it was dark and quiet. the waitress said she didn't know if she could move us and she would ask the manager. We didn't think it would be a big deal since there were plenty of empty tables. When she returned she said that unfortunately they could not accommodate us. We were baffled to say the least. At that point we told her to just charge us for the drinks that we would not be dining anymore. At no point did they even try to simply move us from tables.They would have rather lose service by denying us one of the many empty tables than to accommodate us. Needless to say, I'm still very confused and quite disappointed. I will never come to this place again. Also, it should be noted that when you call to make reservations, they did not ask seating preference, so it would not have mattered if we switched tables anyways! I do not know the ultimate reason as to why they gave us this treatment, but I will say that it felt like we were being discriminated, and that's an awful feeling.",

So not exactly MY favorite type of cuisine but it was good even considering the fact that I don't like fusion foods.

    "text": "Edited to add: someone representing this restaurant sent me a message after my review was posted that was very passive aggressively \"apologizing\" for the other patrons in the restaurant. Did you think you were going to shame me into changing my review? None of that changes the fact that the food is mediocre at best, ridiculously overpriced, it's incredibly loud to the point that you can't carry on any conversation, and ultimately completely unimpressive. The people who frequent a restaurant can say a lot about it - given that those who choose to visit this one were overwhelmingly obnoxious, I think that says something about what this restaurant is all about. I've been to many classy establishments in Scottsdale, and this is just not one of them.   Came here for my two year anniversary at the suggestion of some of the doctor's I worked with. I figured if they, Scottsdale docs, liked it then it must be good. Everything about this place comes off as trying too hard. The other patrons were one step away from Ed Hardy t-shirts and rhinestone jeans, and a table of spoiled brat Scottsdale high schoolers being obnoxious and howling over stupid shit definitely put a damper on the mood. However, as the restaurant can't help who eats there, I didn't hold it against them. The music was deafeningly loud, and as it was our anniversary I would have liked to enjoy some conversations, but that was not happening. The food was sub-par, and considering that it was ridiculously expensive, it was not worth it at all. Very underwhelming all in all, next time I'll stick to one of the classics and not waste my money shooting for trendy and disappointing.",

We took our baby here and joked that no one would be able to hear her if she cried because it was so loud. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here- great food and good service.   Service: our waitress was super sweet and helpful in navigating the menu and giving us suggestions. We wish that they either provided a stack of small plates or cleared our plates occasionally though because having 1 tiny plate for all the different small meals and flavors wasn't ideal. Also after our meal no one wiped down the table so it was dirty while we were eating dessert. These are minor things but are still misses for an expensive trendy place.  Food: We split:  Guacamole w/ Pomegranate: Unique, good contrast with the sweetness of the dried fruit  Rock Shrimp Tempura: nothing special but tasty  Korean Beef Tacos: I thought these were ok but my husband LOVED them- said they were the best tacos he's had in Scottsdale so far  Suzuki Roll: Fresh clean flavors with a kick- and I loved the rice crispy things on the outside  Shaking Beef: This is the #1 ordered dish here according to our waitress and it was just ok- great flavors but the beef seemed overcooked  Lobster & Crab Dynamite: This was my mom's favorite- very rich!  Chocolate sticky cake w/ salted caramel ice cream: a must if you've saved room! We practically licked the plate clean!",

My dish was the $14 Chinese Chicken salad and it was tasty, but didn't blow me away for the price.

There was a group of 5 of us and we were borderline hangry when we showed up for our reservation. Emma was our server and she made great food and drink recommendations. The food started coming out so quickly and we loved everything we got!  Very fun, lively atmosphere with great service and delicious food. The price point is appropriate for the food quality and service we definitely recommend it!  Make sure to get the sea bass, scallops, some sushi rolls, the rock shrimp and the calamari!",

We tried the ceviche Del dia which was delicious chipotle sea bass. The bacon guac is a must. We ate the spongy chocolate cake. The only thing I would change is the bussing of the tables. I also didn't like that my chair was on a secondary piece of wood that went around the tree. Every time someone walked past me, I felt my chair would tip over. But, when the tables are small and you're having tapas, there should be no empty/dirty plates on your table. All in all, I would return to SumoMaya",

We actually went with her other suggestions as well on the menu.  The Korean beef tacos were yummy.  The aroz con pato was muy excelente!  The extra special for me was an awesome grapefruit beer.   Yep,  read that again.  Grapefruit.   Very very good brew.  This would be a good date place and if I was single I have a feeling this would be a good happy hour spot as well.",

On the menu for (I believe) $28, the server conveniently suggested we get it with the noodles...that'll tack on an additional $6 bucks.  The guac was good, the drink selection was suberb.  The last games of the NBA season was on so I was able to steal glances of Kobe lighting it up and the Warriors winning their 73rd on big screen TVs.  The bar scene looked good from afar (ahh the memories).  I also had the Mahi Mahi which was smothered in the tomato goo.  Should have gone with the Sea Bass...  The other thing that was lacking was the pace of the meal.  My wife and I had the quac, another appetizer, and two main courses, and we were in and out of the restaurant in 50 minutes.  The dishes come out as they are ready, but the pace felt frantic.",

Only thing I liked about this restaurant the designs and the big tree right in the middle of the restaurant, I believe it is a real tree. I think it's more of a bar atmosphere rather than going they for food. Give it try, at least you'll like the tree.",

We had so many different waiters that we didn't know who was ours and we were given the wrong food. After we finally notified someone after our supposed waiter was MIA, it took even longer to get our actual food. We have definitely had better Asian food, sushi, and Mexican cuisine.

We wanted to have a late lunch/early dinner, but it turns out only the bar menu is available between the two.  But they do have a great one.  Loved their drink menu and the Sumo-Rita!  Food was just okay for me.  I thought the salmon avocado roll and the spicy yellowtail roll ($5 and $7) were good, but not up to par according to my better half.  The happy hour tacos are a great deal, 2 for $3 or 3 for $5, but just average at best.  I really liked the wild mushroom, the al pastor was good, but nothing special.  The guacamole was the stand-out for me, especially at $5!  Definitely a great happy hour spot.  Good enough to peak my curiosity for their full menu, but not quite good enough for me to prioritize it just yet.",

    "text": "I've heard great things about this restaurant and when restaurant week begin, I told myself, PERFECT.... I am going to go sample this robust flavor of Mexican Fusion. What a disappointment!  First and foremost, the decor/ambiance and food presentation was beautiful, thus why I gave it a 2 stars. The service was slow and the food was terrible!  My friend order the Maya Roll and the Jalapeno Monk. I opted for the prix-fixe menu selection with a Sake Sangria.  Drinks were delivered late to the table. The sushi is bland.  The Ceviche Del Dia had nice flavor yet let's take out the edible flower. Unless I'm camping and the bear stole my food, I don't need edible floras in my dish.  The sauce in the Salmon entree was overly seasoned.  Overly Salty to state bluntly. The dish was coupled with welted asparagus and greasy fried rice.  Now if you call yourself Asian/Mexican fusion, get it right. How the heck to do you mess up fried rice?  Isn't that a staple dish for the two cultures?  The chocolate peanut butter desert was descent, a tad rich for my liking yet edible.  Overall, this is of one of the many new modern dining experience that spent tons of money on decor, located in an expensive neighborhood yet failed to deliver the essence of quality food and impeccable service.",

Asian and Mexican infused that I thought was strange but man did they prove me wrong! I wish they had more locations but I will Go back anytime I'm in Arizona!! Absolutely amazing hands down. Waitress was fun and attentive. She deserved more than 20% bc of the experience she made all of us have.

But I got the food to go.   I wanted desperately to really like this food. Mexican/Asian fusion sounds awesome, their dishes sound great, and it's right up my alley as far as flavors go. We tried 4 things - the bacon-wrapped dates, the suzuki roll, the fried plantains and the Mexican pho.   The bacon-wrapped dates are really, really good. There's not a lot of cheese flavor in them, but it doesn't really matter. The foie gras sauce is perfect with them. I have no idea what these have to do with Asian cuisine or Mexican cuisine, but I don't think I care. The plantains were fine, though a bit underseasoned.  The Suzuki roll was...odd. The flavor itself was somewhat bland, even with the sauce, and the texture of the crust just didn't work. Coming from Seattle I knew that ordering the sushi was going to be a hit or miss thing, but it really just wasn't that great. The big disappointment for me was the pho. I love pho, and I was really hoping for something special here. As it was, it didn't taste like, really, anything special. There was no good anise or meaty flavor that you get from pho, there wasn't any kind of spiciness or interesting flavor like you get from pozole or menudo. The meat was overcooked and tough, the broth a bit bland, and the noodles soggy and not great.   Again, the restaurant itself looks incredible, and  I wouldn't hesitate to bring a date there - don't bring kids, and do dress up. But don't come here just for the food.",

I will say that it is a very nice space, and the service, while not notable at all, was fine. The food is about as unremarkable as you can get. A couple decent items and a whole lot of, well, \"2 star\" material. The kimchi fried rice was about the only dish that really left me feeling good about it.  Drinks were really not great either - not horrible, but again unremarkable.   Food: Meh Drinks: Meh Service: decent Ambiance: cool space, tree inside is a great look. Crowd is a bit poser-ish  The best way I can describe sumomaya is as a concept that is trying too hard, with a crowd that is trying to hard, and an execution level that isn't trying hard enough. If that makes sense lol. Super basic may be a more direct way to sum it up. Im so confused by the 4 and 5 star reviews, but hey, different strokes for different folks. I guess barely average at a higher than a average price appeals to some people. Skip this joint if you're in the area and go 30 seconds north to Roka... Or Shinbay if you're looking for something a little quieter with a set menu. Food and cocktails at Roka Akor are on a different stratosphere (in a very very good way) , the bar is GREAT,  ambiance is very sexy, and service is generally spot on.",

The sushi is great and the guacamole is killer, we have had the traditional, bacon and lump crab guac.  The staff is very friendly and attentive and were okay with us slowing down service to enjoy ourselves.  The ambiance is very relaxing.",

    "text": "What an amazing experience. I stayed at the Hilton across the street and saw the restaurant sign on my way back from my meeting. The concierge gave it high praise and I had to come and check it out.  I LOVED IT!! Loved the food. Loved the bar staff (Dez and Jonathan). Loved the drinks. I've got you say that first glance from outside gave me pause. There are huge screens hanging over the bar with sports turned on.  $@:&#! I HATE TV's in restaurants and I TRIPLE HATE loud sports noise. But...Pleasant surprise. I didn't have to look at the screens when I sat under them  at the bar. TRIPLE PLEASANT SURPRISE... No noise from the TVs. They were playing super cool music. The kind that sort of puts me in a special happy mood. Like the kind you'd hear if you were boarding a Virgin America flight to Paradise with your BFF. The staff was so damn friendly that I nearly fell off my seat. Instant chemistry. The look and feel of the place was beyond my idea of perfection. Clean. Modern. Cool. Crisp. Light. Light.  Light. There was light in the damn place. Owners/managers: dark is Not cool. It's just fucking dark. I was alone but the noise levels were so perfect that I could easily carry on a convo with the bar tender and folks next to me. Sooooo much better than the ear splitting, jet engine noise of DC restaurants. Owners/managers: loud is not cool. Loud is just fucking loud. Stop it already. This place was idyllic. The food was amazing. I had the Rock Shrimp Tempura Roll and the Chinese Style Chile-Crab Garlic Noodles. Both delicious. But the atmosphere at 6 pm on a Monday night would have made up for anything. I couldn't resist the Chicken TingaTaco for dessert. Three (or was it four) special rum drinks later (as specially made by Jonathan) and I was ready for bed. I didn't even notice the bill. I was king for a night, but all good things must come too an end.",

While the \"Mexican, Asian Fusion\" sounded a bit scary at first, the menu is better described as both Mexican AND Asian rather than fusion.  The Tacos are fantastic and the Sushi is some of the best in the area.  Sumo Maya is also a great place to watch a game as the bar has an extensive drink menu as well as several large televisions.",

    "text": "Wow I have been to few restaurants as interesting as this one. Mexican Asian fusion. Huh. I came with a group of 4 girls on a Thursday night. We wanted to get happy hour prices but they only serve that in the bar area and there were no seats. We shared a lot of small plates. We started with the pomegranate guac which was great, and I liked the chips it came with. They were very big round, freshly fried tortilla chips. The veggie roll was good with a big slice of avocado on top. The pho was interesting. Not my favorite, it did not resemble pho whatsoever. It tasted like warm salsa. We also got the beef tacos (bomb!) and chicken tacos, also delicious. The kimchi rice was also good. The server forgot about our rice until we almost had to leave, but we really wanted to try it so we hung around for them to finally bring it out. The service could have been better, our guy seemed a little aloof. My green tea was empty for too long, too many times. But interesting food, and beautiful, cool environment.",

We both had 3 taco+veggie plate and each got three diff tacos.  The mushroom taco was mushy and weird and the Korean taco lacked flavor.   The rest were only ok.  The only great thing was the Mexican corn but I found two hard unpopped corn kernels in it and almost broke my tooth.  We told the waiter and he didn't even acknowledge the complaint.  Three stars ONLY for the ambiance of the place.  Gorgeous.",

    "text": "Waited for my birthday to experience this restaurant and was so looking forward to it. Arrived at 930pm for our reservation and it was really busy(in a good way). It took 15 minutes for the server to come over and take a drink order and then carded us but never mentioned it being my birthday or anything so that pretty much means she didn't even look at the date. My dinner date assumed she was the server assistant since she only took a drink order and gave us water. It took another 10 minutes to get the drinks and then to our surprise she was our server and took our food order 20 minutes later. I was looking forward to having several courses spaced out over the night and was excited for the food. The bacon guacamole was excellent and everything I had hoped for. The 2 rolls we ordered were old and horrible. Do they premake some of these on busy nights and I just got old ones that weren't ordered? The rice was dry and hard and even the kiwi on top wasn't juicy. Server never really asked how it was jsut walked up and said are you finished and took the whole roll away just missing 2 pieces. Then we ordered some tacos and guess what? Old dry chicken that tasted horrible and the beef one was juicy but I refused to eat it out of principle since the night was so bad. At this point I had been there just under 2 hours and had only had 2 beers because she never would come around to take an order and had several dishes served that were all crap. The manager then comes over and says the server informed him we had sent back several dishes. His hands were shaking he was so nervous and I let him know it wasn't his fault he didn't prepare the meal but everything served was bad and old and a complete let down and service was bad. He offered his card to buy me a drink the next tiem I was in and walked away. Server dropped the check with everything on it and I had to tell her what I was and wasn't paying for.  PATHETIC ON ALL ACCOUNTS IN EVERY WAY!",

For $29, you get all you can eat small plates and desserts, PLUS one entree. For an additional $10, you get bottomless mimosas (they have several flavors like passionfruit, pineapple, blood orange and traditional) or bloody marys.   If you are planning on spending time day-drinking, mingling and having a good time with your pals, this offer is hard to beat.   The wait staff is friendly and on the ball (considering there were about 20 of us in the party, I can tell you that keeping all the glasses filled was no small feat, but they handled it like pros!) A few stand out plates were: 3 leches creme brulee oatmeal (OMG!), pork al pastor pad thai (a reallllllllly good-sized portion...it was enough to feed two \"kinda hungry\" people), and the guacamole. The cinnamon orange French toast was also pretty tasty.",

When I first walked in, the ambience was clean, airy and the decor was beautiful and funky. The Hostess smiled as she greeted us and we were seated immediately since we had called and made a reservation ahead of time. She seated us at a table with a \"princess\" chair which my 9 year old daughter loved!  Just one of the many fun, quirky decor pieces. When you look around, you will appreciate the attention to detail from the interior design on the walls to the place settings. I especially loved the exposition kitchen which was fascinating to watch and brought a lot of energy into the room.   We were lucky to have Mauren as our Server. She was delightful, energetic and a top notch, knowledgeable server. She explained the menu to us and made me the most amazing Mimosa, just one of a few I had with the \"Bottomless Brunch\". Thank you! It was a very busy Sunday but Mauren made sure to stop by and refill our drinks while making sure we had everything needed as we enjoyed the amazing food she recommended.   My 9 year old still talks about the Churro Waffles she had complete with chocolate ice cream on top. I can't stop thinking about the pomegranate guacamole. It is a must have when you visit! We also had the 3 Leches Oatmeal, a comforting combination of Bananas, walnuts and cinnamon sugar goodness. The Yogurt Granola and fruit plate was satisfyingly fresh. My older daughter had the Coconut Mango Pancakes which I tried because she knows I love coconut. I only wished there was more coconut flavor and more Mango inside the pancake, instead it was only sprinkled on top from what I could tell. Still, it was a good pancake.  Other dishes we tried were the breakfast potatoes, chef's assorted sushi and Huevos Revueltos Al Albanil which were all very tasty.   As an entree I ordered the Green Chili Pork Burrito per my daughter's recommendation and she was right...it was excellent! Full of fresh layers of flavor. I ate half and took half of it home to eat later in the evening since I still needed room for dessert.   For dessert, we tried a little of both options on the menu. The Cinnamon Crisps with cajeta were light and crispy with the perfect amount of sweetness. The liquid cheesecake was delicious with berries and toasted coconut. I would have never thought I would have enjoyed cheesecake as much in liquid form. I was pleasantly surprised. We all enjoyed this Asian-Mexican fusion menu, especially my youngest child. My compliments to the Chef and Kitchen Staff. She even tried some new foods since they were so attractive and appealing to the eye. It would be difficult to not find at least one item on the menu that you would love to eat and would come back for again and again.   The service was among the best we have ever had since Mauren was so knowledgeable about the food from personal experience and was able to make the best recommendations for each of us. This was definitely a memorable dining experience with my daughters while visiting Scottsdale Arizona. I highly recommend this restaurant. It is more than food...it is a culinary experience and I enjoyed it!",

    "text": "Went to check out Cinco de Mayo specials that I read about on-line. $5 margaritas and happy hour prices all night!  I arrived at around 6:00pm and the place was packed! The hostess was helpful, we ended up grabbing a high top table within 5 mins. Instead of waiting 30 mins. for the sushi bar.  I ordered the house margarita, sesame ginger chicken taco, tempura cod taco, and chicharron de pollo. Everything came out VERY quickly and tasted super fresh. My uncle had the edamame and Salmon avocado handroll which he enjoyed.   Overall great service, decent portions, and flavorful food. Considering the crowd that was there, everything was perfect.",

    "text": "This place seems to have disruptive power politics going on.  The hostess set a bad tone. She let me know that the place was still in happy hour, informed me that the bar and high top tables where available, but didn't really take control of the situation. I expected her to gesture for me and read that this was probably my first time there and I was a bit disoriented. I had to search for the high tables. (Pro tip: they are behind the massive bar that's flanked by a partition wall.) Unfortunately, when the rest of my party arrived they got the same standoffish greeting.  Our waitress was better but still didn't impress us. When she sat us down she didn't bring menus, then she brought us the wrong happy hour menus, and I had to ask to be moved to a normal table. She said she had to ask front desk if my group of four could be moved. I have two questions: 1. How does this place think one of their high tables is appropriate for four at dinner? 2. Why can't our server make the decision on what's best for her patrons?  The food? Surprisingly good but the portions where small. $16 for a cylindrical ice cream scoop of flavored rice with an egg on top? Pathetic.  If you're going to take a lady or gentleman out do not pick this spot. Drive to Old Town and get yourself some decent service and priced food.  The bar tenders where great though!",

Usually it's at a place around the corner from his house, sometimes it's at a sushi restaurant, sometimes the AYCE Brazilian BBQ.   This time he picked SumoMaya, and I am so glad he did.  It seemed really out of place in a business park, but once inside I decided it was one of the best restaurant layouts I've ever seen.  There was a (fake) tree right behind our table, and the whole restaurant was open to the outside lights, yet enclosed so it wasn't too hot.  The kitchen was also open so you could see them making the food.  Our server was super friendly and helped us pick out some dishes.  I have to say literally everything that was put on our table was amazing.  We've dined at SushiSamba before and you can tell the chef came from there, as some of the dishes seemed to come from there.  Our favorite was the tuna tacos, of which we ended up ordering another round at the end of the meal.  I just can't say enough good things about this place.  Even the basic sushi rolls were amazing.  Can't wait to go back!",

I would say each item was either good or bad.... no in-between.  Food is imaginative, and certainly looked good, but it was not necessarily tasty.  Service was about as bad as it gets in Scottsdale.  We ordered a round of drinks that did not show up until well after the appetizers (a good 20 minutes).  We ordered a second round of drinks during dinner, but they did not show up until after we were done.  The place was outrageously loud.  Not a good place for a group planning to have any conversations.  It has a trendy feel and vibe and if that is all you are looking for, it is probably fine, but if you want quality food or service, there are many better choices nearby.",

I've heard so much about this place and added it to my \"Places to Check Out\" list for a while. I'm so, so glad I finally have it a try.   I'm a bourbon and whiskey lover ....tequila, vodka and cognac drinker. We both ordered old fashions they were so good. For the second round however, I wanted something a little different but heavy. I don't like sweet drinks. The kind and very attentive bartender suggested a drink similar to the old fashioned but made with a really good tequila. It was PERFECT! I wish I could remember the name! We also shared an order of calamari and sushi... both delish!!   We've already made plans to check them out again this week! Perfect ladies night out or date night kind of place!",

We had the pomegranate guacamole to start. While the guacamole was good in itself, the pomegranate part wasn't worth it. In addition to the Pom seeds there were dried apricots on top which just wasn't great. If you're looking for better fruity guacamole, stick with barrio queen. I was torn between the pork belly pad Thai and the ramen, and the server recommended the ramen. I was not disappointed! The egg was heavenly, just the right amount of soft, the pork was flavorful and there was a perfect relationship of noodles to broth. So happy to have found this place! I'll definitely be back for happy hour ASAP, so I can try everything!!",

We were worried about us not being served enough for every course, but that was not the case. There were 5 courses plus dessert and all the food was incredible. I am still dreaming about the shrimp ceviche and the sushi rolls. I will travel back to Scottsdale for this place!",

My friends told me that it's kind of like a tapas (small plate) menu, so we ordered a bunch of stuff & shared. First out was the \"bacon guacamole\" which was tasty. Next out was \"tempura unagi roll\" which was good as well. It reminded me a lot of a Las Vegas roll. We also had the \"crispy pork belly roll\" which was different. It was pretty good, but I don't normally like pork belly. My friends really liked it though. I also ordered the \"Lobster & Crab Dynamite\" which was delicious. For a drink I ordered the skinny margarita which was awesome. This is definitely a busy, \"where the cool people hang out\" type place & I can't wait to try more things off the menu.",

We also tried the Mexican style pho which was pretty horrible.. So salty and way too much lime. Didn't even taste like a tortilla soup.. Barley edible.

Opted the kitchen bar with seats overlooking the chefs.   Turns out that SumoMaya is an Asian-Mexican fusion restaurant. (Makes total sense once you look at the sign and the decor.)  With an eclectic menu that our server explained was small plates that are to be shared and served as they are ready.  I was with a Vegan who doesn't eat anything with \"eyes\" so that limited our selections.   Started with the house margarita. It was ok - a bit pricey for the size but that was the theme of the menu.  The guacamole was good. It was served with tortilla rounds covered in a nice spice!  The roasted mushrooms were covered in a lovely Vietnamese caramel sauce. We split our choices at this point - he had the Vegetable Lo Mein and I had the Carnitas Taco.  The taco portions were tiny but with the two other items, it made a meal.   We didn't opt dessert but from our seats, we watched the Tres Leches cake being prepped and it looked great!!  If you're looking for quiet conversation, this place isn't the best. The large open room allows conversations to carry.  It's the perfect place to hang out with friends.",

Desert - salted caramel ice cream w/chocolate cake was very good! The wines are pricey - a small glass of red wine $18 .. yikes!  Setting and atmosphere are quite nice; loved the \"tree\" in the middle of the dining area and wait staff is attentive.",

Taco Maria in CA is the epitome of great fusion w Mexican flavors.  I think for the price, you would do far better at La Hacienda in AZ. For a tastier, cheaper alternative try Barrio Queen. Both are less fusiony though.",

    "text": "This is a super fun experience.  I've only been here for brunch but it's a great experience and I would definitely recommend it.  The cuisine is a Mexican-Asian fusion but not in a weird fried sushi with queso type of way.  I've had a couple of different sushi rolls, a breakfast dish, a fried rice dish, and my favorite - the ahi tuna tostada.  Everything here tastes super fresh with tons of flavor.  It's one of those menus where I feel you can't go wrong with what you order, plus there's something for everyone - fresh fish sushi, tacos, vegetarian options, breakfast, etc. all available on the brunch menu.  I've been here between 10-noon and it's also not super busy allowing for excellent service.  Lastly, they have bottomless drinks particularly mimosas including different flavors which are fun and delicious.",

However, all three of my experiences at this restaurant have been ruined by the lack of customer service and disorganization of staff. My first experience at this restaurant was pleasant. However, My friends and I would have enjoyed our meal mote if our food had arrived at the same time.  Round two: reservation was lost   Round three: snooty brunette lady bartender made my friend feel very uncomfortable when she apologetically asked to have her drink made to accommodate her severe food allergy by stating \"I literally don't care, that's how the drinks made.\" Our reservation was at 7, was sat at 740 (due to the dust storm, not sure how that effects things). Lastly, and once again, everyone's food was brought out at a different time. I'm done.",

The good: Showed up  Friday night without a reservation, the host seated us rather quickly Server was great explained the menu in great detail.  The bad: While waiting for our appetizers German Osio (the owner) came by to introduce himself. He was slurring his words and seemed drunk. During our meal we noticed German get into an altercation with a guest that was sitting close by.  German followed the guy outside. My girl was curious to see what happened so she stepped outside. She saw German choke the guy and then saw the guy punch German in the face knocking him out cold! The police and ambulance showed up it was a huge scene. For this guy to own two other restaurants in the valley he is highly unprofessional. I've never witnessed such animalistic behavior before, especially in Scottsdale. All in all food was mediocre but it might just have been the owners behavior that ruined our experience. This place won't be open long if German keeps up this behavior, I will NOT be back.",

We had a good experience.  Lively, trendy, energetic vibe.  Great architecture and open feel to this.  Classic contemporary AZ feel.  We tried many dishes.  The salmon apple maki roll and tempura rockshrimp seemed to be the tables favorite.  Although, we had to try their billionaire roll ($50), I don't care how good it was, I have a problem spending $50 for a roll...but it was really good.  The miso soy sea bass tasted a little fishy, but my dining mates didn't seem to mind.  The shaking beef and the pork tacos were very good.  All in all, I think this fusion tapas place is a great concept with well executed food.  Service:  This is a little tougher for me.  Although generally we had good service from Nicole and the rest of the servers, food runners, managers...but they were all moving too fast and never engaged us to ask us how our dinner was.  Now I don't think that I need someone talking to me about how my vacation is going, however, I do think that the constant frenzied pace that all staff is moving is off-putting.  My recommendation to their GM/Owner would be to train their people to smile more, be friendly, and slow down to engage your customers.  When I come back to Scottsdale, I will come back to SumoMaya for the food...maybe the service will be a little more personal and engaging.",

It was happy hour so that started off cool the bar was packed so I found a seat and immediately made small talk with patrons. Attempted small talk with bartender he was pretty bland so I moved on. My friends that I was meeting arrived we sat at a high table. We ordered plenty of drinks and I ordered food. I asked for no tofu add chicken I got tofu and burnt chicken. Told waitress she was unbothered. Service was HORRIBLE 25-30 minutes to get each round. Maybe more. After spending about $250 and some guy who claimed he was the manager approached us and asked are you guys leaving soon? I asked why? He said we have  people waiting for tables so I was trying to see how long. We hadn't even finished our last round of drinks. Horrible. We quickly paid and left and told everyone we encountered the next day. Place is fun and cool, drinks are good, food mediocre service THE WORST. Of the 5 of us NOBODY said they ever wanna hang there again. I don't know how this place has such great ratings because in my book if service is bad you can't get above a 3.",

The server was so helpful, she explained food to us, turned off heaters, had fast response time...She made the experience for me and my girl...  The people next to us were awesome too! We ordered the rock shrimp roll, the crab meat guacamole, the tuna tacos and the tres leche cake! everything was immaculate and up to expectation.. The only thing i left unsure of was whether i liked the layout and scenery of the restaurant or the food better..?",

After the service was so bad the last time, we hadn't been back in a couple of years, We had the bacon-wrapped dates, the miso eggplant and some sushi. It was all pretty good. The bacon was a bit overcooked but still tasty. Unfortunately, they still haven't fixed their problem with service. The waitress took forever to take our orders and rarely checked on us afterwards. One of the helpers brought out sushi but we still had no soy sauce. The \"helper\" brought MORE of the sushi, but again still no soy sauce & no sign of our waitress. We had to go scrounge some from the sushi bar. She didn't refill our drinks either. It was very frustrating for what is supposedly an upscale restaurant.",

The place is a great spectacle and the food is ironically amazing. However the service was really the biggest quirky part of the place. Our wait staff was pleasant but honestly had no clue what was going on. No one seemed to know the menu or what came with what... Although in the middle of knowing nothing all of the sudden there were little glimpses of brilliance on the part of the staff. I've got it... The staff is a paradox. Honestly the food and the place saved the experience. The staff kinda made my head spin.",

    "text": "My friend came into town from Portland, and she wanted to meet someplace with my husband, brother and I. I had passed this place repeatedly and decided to take a chance on this place for an early dinner. We went for Happy Hour partially.  Overall opinion: Although *some* of the dishes were delicious, the amount we paid for the meal did not feel equal to the amount we received in service or food and drink. Also, Happy Hour is definitely not a great steal either. Save your money, and go to a place that has substance in food quality and staff. This is a restaurant that looks very nice in ambiance and makes it feel like it's a hip, trendy spot, but the actual experience leaves you empty inside.  When we first entered the establishment, there were two girls standing at the hostess table just staring at us as they continued tinkering with some knobs/some kind of device at the front. Let me preface first that the restaurant was empty; there were only a few people at the bar. My husband and I had to greet them and ask them about a table before they half-heartedly asked us to try to find a seat at the bar or a high table top. There were four of us, and the high tables were not large enough to accommodate even our waters and the small happy hour menus - let alone giving us large dinner menus or even accommodate any appetizers. We had to put the menus on a nearby chair, and when we finally got our order in for the alcohol, there was some commotion happening next to us where a server randomly shouted to her peer, \"You better not f---in' do that to me again,\" and started banging around some empty pitchers/slamming things on the server station. We then suggested to our server that we didn't think the table given to us was a suitable space to eat so she said she would find a table, and the girls in the front seemed irritated and reluctant to get us an actual dinner table.  The food was okay and the portion sizes were small compared to the price you were paying. We tried to take advantage of Happy Hour prices, so we grabbed an order of the Spicy Tuna Hand Roll (came in 4 pieces), the Tekka Maki roll (came in 6 pieces), a plate of charred edamame, a handful of crispy calamari and 5 Grilled Chicken Wings. What I will say is that the flavor on all of the above was great. The sushi rolls had this perfect, light vinegary taste to the actual seaweed, which brought a little more flavor to an otherwise boring Tekka Maki roll. The Spicy Tuna was suggested to us, but it was honesty the most bland and forgettable of the ones we ordered. Everything else was good, but we spent too much on these tiny dishes - as an example, almost $10 on only 5 chicken wings and $8 on a tiny handful of lightly sauced calamari.  The food was equally disappointing where we thought if we were paying for two tuna tacos or two Korean beef tacos that they would be full sized tacos. They were $9 for two, and the portion sizes were mini tacos! The garlic noodles was $16 and it came in this large bowl but it was the portion size smaller than my fist. The chile-crab garlic noodles and the ginger fried rice were both bland. The crab had no flavor.  Our waitress was nice and checked on our drinks occasionally. The guy that brought us our food was friendly as well. I really did not appreciate that we \"disrupted\" the hostesses at the front.  Honestly, I don't think we will be coming back here again, but if you HAVE to go because it's mandatory, I would say to stick to the appetizer menu.",

When ever I have visitors come to town, this is always the first place I take them too.  I love that you get to order a bunch of small dishes and try so many different things.  The miso eggplant is amazing.  I'm so glad my server recommended it because I never would have thought to order it, and now it is always one of the first things I make sure to order.  Their drinks are also really good, I love the green magic mojito and their seasonal margarita is always amazing.  I highly recommend this place (but not if you're looking for somewhere quiet).",

The brunch is endless which means all of the shared sides and desserts are bottomless, so you get to try so many things. You each pick one entree, which was a hard choice! I got the cinnamon French toast at the recommendation of our waitress, and it was to die for. My mom got the torta and was super impressed. The atmosphere is pretty energetic and loud, so don't expect to come here and have a quiet meal. I liked that though, as it added to the excitement of everyone getting to try all of the amazing dishes. They also had a house band which was super fun. Veda was our waitress and her service was fantastic. She was totally attentive and very friendly. I plan to come back and bring more and more friends with me!",

    "text": "Awesome place for brunch. Definitely come with a group because you'll want to try everything on the menu and unless you are a professional eater, there's no way you can tackle this alone. The concept is great- $29 for unlimited shared plates and desserts + an entree. Add $10 for bottomless drinks. With a deal this great, I worried that the food would be meh and the drinks bad, but boy was I wrong.  Drinks - 5 different mimosa flavors, I can vouch for the blood orange version. Served in a wine glass that is refilled as soon as it empties. - Bloody Mary- subdued garnish compared to some of the over-the-top meals-in-a-glass elsewhere, but the drink itself was really good in terms of strength and spice.  Starters - Mexican sweet breads- 3 different flavors, loved that they cut these into small pieces so that I could try them all and not fill up. - 3 leches oatmeal brulee- this was my fave!! It came with a cup of sweet milk to pour over the top, it took this dish over the top! - fruit/yogurt/granola- The melon wasn't super sweet, but the berries were good. And it was nice to have something on the light side - Black bean hummus- yum! nice and creamy. I'm not a plantain chip fan, but these beans were good on their own and with the eggs... - Huevos revueltos- Loved these, too, especially with a bit of the bean hummus. - Bread migas- I'm not a chorizo fan, so these weren't mind fave. - Guacamole- topped with pomegranate seeds- yum. I suggest not filling up on the tostada chips - Sushi rolls- fine, but not may fave given all the other fab food on the table.  Full yet? Don't be. There's still more to come. You get to select an entree - B ordered the Cuban breakfast sandwich- it's a lot of meat, but very tasty. - Waffle- the menu said sweet potato with bananas, but I think what I had was actually a blueberry waffle with a side of mixed berries. No matter, it was delish. I topped with a bit of flavored whip cream that I stole from my friend's son (I think it came with his french toast?)  Side Dishes- I can't speak to these because we didn't order any. That's probably a good thing, because though they sound tasty, with the 11 of us, there was more than enough food on the table already.   Dessert- If you make it this far, you may be close to the limit, but save room for at least a taste of each of these. - Bunuelos- cinnamon crisps drizzled with dulce de leche. Sweet, so just a bite is enough. Would be great with a cup of coffee - Liquid cheesecake with berries- tasted like a soft version of cheesecake filling.   The place fills up, so make a reservation. Even though it's crowded, service is great and the energy positive (helped by some pumping music). Definitely recommend and will be back.",

We have planned many events here in the past, but we will not be coming here again. The brunch is a COMPLETE RIP OFF. $29 (without drinks) for \"endless\" tiny sized appetizers and 1 tiny entree. You need to ask multiple times for them to bring out more of these tiny appetizers to the point where it is just irritating. We ended up spending the additional $10 for bottomless mimosas, and again you need to ask multiple waiters, multiple times to bring you more. The portion sizes have significantly decreased, I've never left brunch HUNGRY before after spending $30. The sushi they bring with the lunch is just California rolls, and one other roll with the tiniest piece of fish. The second and third round of sushi was just avocado and cucumber. NOT WORTH IT. So many other places around the area for much better lunch at half the price.",

WARNING FOOD PORTIONS ARE VERY VERY SMALL!!! I asked the server for something that was NOT spicy because I'm a wuss when it comes to hot food. She recommended 2 things that were incredibly spicy! My boyfriend loves spicy and he got the pad Thai and liked it okay, nothing great about it though. But he thought my food was MUCH spicier! I then ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, which was amazing. However, I only got 4 small chunks of meat on a kabob stick for $14. For that to be a normal entree I would've need like 3 kabob sticks = 12 bites = $42. The sea bass is the reason I'm rating this 3 stars, because that would be the only reason I would go back.   I feel this place strongly relies on the atmosphere to carry it. The decorations were very cool. There's even a tree in the middle of the restaurant. But the chairs were super hard! They clearly want to turn tables quickly.",

My daughter and her friend ordered the the chili crab garlic noodles.  Both of them remarked it lacked a distinct flavor.  We had the tres leches desert but found the marshmellow topping to be too much.  It took us over two hours to be served.  Our dishes arrived randomly. First came the guacamole which my daughter order and then 15 minutes later our first course arrived.  Shortly after that my daughter's second course arrived.  Ours did not show up for another 20 minutes.  There was another lull of 15 minutes and my dates arrived.  Our main course did arrive at the same time as did the desert.    We sat next to a table that the occupants were getting rather drunk  They were practicing yoga poses on the floor and falling.  Overall impression this restaurant is not for us.  Not our style.

It took us forever to get our food and when it did come my pad thai was ok not great and my moms veggie torta was also mediocre. The main reason I will never go back is when we ordered desert our server verbally told us the menu and we ordered the cheesecake. When it came it was covered in peanuts after I specifically told the server I was allergic when I ordered the pad thai peanut free. I'm leaving on a flight and didn't have time for them to make me something else. So overall mediocre food and terrible service.",

So, we had chicken wings, pretty good, calamari, needed to be a little crisper. Bacon and chorizo dates were very rich, could have been a dessert. Pretty tasty. Chicken enchiladas, surprisingly good. Split a dessert and that was the hit of the night. Tea cake and strawberry panacotta. Luscious. This place is loud, trendy and expensive. Fits perfectly where it is.

She introduced me to Mango, and Prickly Pear also.   Now, my mimosa game is stronger thanks to her.  Before placing my food order, Jordan made sure my food allergies were addressed and the kitchen was made aware.

And the service was so incredibly slow! Took a full hour to get our food. Felt bad for my friend celebrating her bday... we really played up how awesome the restaurant was and we let her down.

Our server was great and offered suggestions and modifications for vegetarians. You can choose an unlimited amount of appetizers (they'll bring it out two at a time as to not clutter the table), one main course per person, sides and finally dessert!   Appetizers: would STRONGLY recommend the guacamole with pomegranate. I have never tried it with pomegranate before and I loved it. Would also highly recommend the 3 leches oatmeal brulee. It wasn't too heavy and tasted absolutely amazing. Ordered the black bean hummus as well, which was okay. The other two were definitely our favorite.   Main course: we ordered the coconut pancakes with mangoes and the vegetarian version of the enchiladas suizas. Both were delicious but the enchiladas were the definitely the winner. The plate was filled with the flavorful salsa verde and pomegranate once again on the enchiladas. Honestly, these were the best enchiladas that I've ever had. Still craving it.   Sides: at this point, we were so full already but ordered the breakfast potatoes, which were ok.  Dessert: loved loved loved the liquid cheesecake. It had such a unique wonderful flavor! The presentation was beautiful as well. Also got the Bunuelos which was melted in your mouth. Also delicious.   Overall, I cannot wait to come back here!",

    "text": "Came here for an early HH drink and nibble. Instantly when you enter, you feel transformed into a space w ambient and eclectic decor. There is a tree in the middle of the restaurant. The clear seats are a contrast to all the other decor with lots of color. We had a reservation but ended up opting to sit at the bar because my bf wanted to watch some football game.   Drinks - I got the Sake-to-me- tint ($10 ~ $2 off during HH) ~ which was a vodka, sake and blackberry cocktail that wasnt very strong, good choice for those who want the taste of alcohol to be masked, but I liked that it wasn't overly sweet.  My BF got a local craft beer - it was light and pretty good.   Food - from the HH menu -  ~ we got some yellowtail handrolls ($4 each) and sushi rolls ($8). Ive been spoiled with great sushi, and knowing that this is a fusion spot, I had very low/americanized expectations. I was pleasantly impressed and thought the handrails and sushi were pretty good for HH pricing, my only gripe was that some of the seaweed from the rolls unraveled a bit, which didn't bother me too much, but little a little bit of an annoyance relying on the stickiness of the rice to hold it together.  ~ enchilada suizas ($6) - this was delicious, the cheese melted nicely over the chicken enchiladas, and I thought the pop of sweetness and tart from the pomegranate was an interesting combo of flavor. This was a great recommendation from our server, and I would get this again.   As an asian Mexican fusion spot, I thought this place did a really great job in introducing asian flavors to people not as well versed with asian cuisine. I felt like they just had both asian inspired dishes as well as Mexican inspired instead of fusion of flavors in each dish, but since the HH menu is pretty limited, ill be sure to try their other items next time I'm in the Scottsdale area again.",

    "text": "Very hip and trendy place for brunch with large groups. You'll definitely need to make a reservation in advanced to get in with a larger group on the weekends. Service was excellent. Our server was super accommodating and kept our bottomless drinks topped off all morning.  The bottomless brunch is \"just okay\" in my opinion... each person pays $30 for bottomless appetizers and a main dish, and while the portions are small and the food is pretty yummy I did not feel like I could eat $30 worth of food while also drinking bottomless mimosas (which was an extra $10). The drink deal was awesome, but you could only access it with purchase of the bottomless brunch which ended up being a pretty penny for what turned out to be a bunch of chips and guac in the morning.  I got a churro waffle for my main entree which I was barely able to eat after already being full on appetizers and drinks.   Overall, I think if I go back I'd rather just split a few apps with the table, but I'd be bummed not to be able to get the drink special standalone.   You definitely pay for the cool ambiance which is almost worth it, but I'd say be sure to come hungry if you plan to spend on the bottomless brunch.",

    "text": "What a fun place for brunch!  There were 4 of us for Sunday brunch on Cinco de Mayo.  Yes, it was a busy day there!  Hence my 4 stars.  Everything was pretty terrific, but it was so noisy we had to scream to be heard over the noise and the music playing only made it worse.  My suggestion is to sit outside.  That might have been a better choice.  However, we still had a great time and I really enjoyed the whole dining set up that they do for brunch.    You basically pay one price and they give you endless stuff of everything with one entree choice.  Our server was great.  She made the selections for us and just started bringing food.  Then she asked if there were any other items we wanted to add in or repeat.  We were thankful to have some direction to get us started.  I was a fan of all of the starters and enjoyed their interpretations which were different than the norm.  For our entries, I got seduced into trying the fried chicken torta which really was a fried chicken sandwich with some tasting toppings.  Not really a sandwich person, it might not have been my smartest choice.  I did taste some of the other dishes at the table and the Pad Thai and Chinese Sausage Fried Rice were some of my favs!  You get a ton of food and it is best to go with a group of at least 4 or more to really make it worth your while.  And save a little room for dessert, the de-constructed cheesecake was the bomb!  And I don't even like cheesecake!!",

    "text": "TL:DR: Disappointment galore.  Everything looked, felt and tasted wrong and the service was mediocre.   Long version:  I visited SumoMaya for a friend's birthday, and I would not return even under pain of death.   We partook of their Bottomless Brunch, and after trying the many food offerings, I am reminded the universe is a cold and uncaring place and we are tiny and unimportant in the face of overwhelming darkness.   The brunch is a four course meal, with each course somehow more disappointing than the last.   Course one consisted of the following appetizers: - Fruit with plain yogurt and granola, the only palatable offering. - Pomegranate Guacamole, a poorly assembled mess of half mashed avocado, cilantro and pomegranate that makes one wonder why someone would attempt to experiment with a dish if they haven't mastered the basics.  - Sushi rolls that would be right at home at your local dollar tree.  - Black Bean Hummus, which is nothing more than poorly seasoned black bean dip. Stare into this black abyss at your own risk, and for goodness sake do not ingest it. - Tres Leches Oatmeal, which I decided to avoid like I would anything resembling something a cat would leave on your carpet.  The second course consisted of a single \"entree\", I chose the Cubano Eggs Benedict. I was initially upset that it consisted of a single serving of Benedict, until I put it in my mouth at which point I felt an immense wave of relief knowing my suffering would end that much sooner.  The third course, the sides to our entree, which I was unwilling to even try after being let down twice already, but I reluctantly tried their Chinese Sausage Fried rice with pineapple, and immediately regretted my optimism after half a forkful. The rice was mushy and I could taste a hint of the cook's hatred for humanity.   I decided to cut my losses and avoid their potatoes and whatever else was on offer as well as their dessert, which looked like congealed sadness.   Needless to say I will never be returning to this place and I urge you to avoid it like the plague that it is.",

    "text": "I've always driven by SumoMaya but never really tired it. My son was home and decided to try Sumo. Didn't really know what to expect.   There is some parking but a majority of parking was valet. They have these huge glass doors and then boom. The SumoMaya experience just hits you. Loud music and an overpowering bar like atmosphere. Huge bar in the middle with sports on the tv. People not really watching tv but lots people having good times.   Our waitress greeted us and she explained that this wasn't your normal restaurant. You put your order in and whenever it comes out of the kitchen then they bring to your table. Don't expect your dishes to come out together. It's more family style and tapas style. Small dishes to share.   We started off with some Happy hour menu items like crispy calamari and happy hour tacos. The calamari had a sweet but a little stronger spicy taste with half cut cherry tomatoes. I thought it was okay. The tacos are Street tacos. Just a couple of bites each. Very good. Very fresh but unique flavors.   Also ordered the Chinese sausage with pineapple rice which was pretty good. Little different Chinese sausage but was pretty good. The Eel Avocado Roll was good too. Very fresh. Very good. Enjoyed the sushi. Then we decided to get more street tacos and got Steak, Al Pastor, and Korean. All were excellent. Very fresh. Very good. Just love the variety of flavors that they all bring out.   Ended the night with dessert as always. Ordered the La Pina Coloda which has coconut ice cream and coconut cake. Very good. Very different. Very unique. Something you just have to experience yourself.   So overall I loved this place. Good service. Very friendly waitress and she always checked on us. If our food didn't make it to our table then she was always checking with the kitchen on us. Some items came out slower than others but that's okay. It's family or tapas style. Just eat, enjoy, and have fun. Love the ambiance. Very fun environment. Good food. Fresh food. Just different from most restaurant in the valley. It's more of a younger crowd as you can tell.   We had fun and enjoyed the food and atmosphere. I will be back again. Enjoy",

An incident took place where the server accidentally split coffee on my new shoes, and the General Manager, John, was swift to remedy the situation. He was collected and professional and sent me a check a week following to compensate for my shoes. He also took care of my brunch, so needless to say Sumo Maya has epitomized radical hospitality. On top on the service, the food is to die for and some personal favorites were the pomegranate guacamole, the enchiladas and the Huevos Rancheros. Thank you John and Sumo Maya, we will definitely be returning.",

    "text": "SumoMaya = the perfect mix of Mexican and Asian in a trendy and fun atmosphere.  I've been several times... each of them was a girls night out, and it's a great destination for that -- especially if your party is into sharing food, enjoying a few drinks, and being entertained by fellow diners and the Scottsdale scene.  This place offers a solid drink menu filled with unique and tasty cocktails, a fabulous selection of wine, beer, and tons of tequila too.  I just now realized that this is likely due to the fact that their Beverage Director is Bill DeGroot, who is no stranger to the Valley's cocktail scene; this guy is quite an expert in his field!  I'm a huge fan of both Mexican and Asian flavors... I totally recommend doing a mix when you go here.  Some of my fave menu items are: -Pomegranate Guacamole -Sumo \"Chopped\" Salad -Korean Beef Tacos -Wild Mushroom Tacos -Shishito Peppers -Miso Eggplant  **And then depending on how adventurous your palate is when it comes to sushi, you can't go wrong with the following basics: -\"Real\" California Roll -Salmon-Avocado -Spicy Tuna  Or if you are feeling like something a little bit more unique when it comes to flavor, go for any of these: -Suzuki Roll: spicy tuna, avocado, masago, chipotle aioli -Apple Salmon Roll -Or any of their other specialty rolls, all of which sound awesome.  I especially look forward to trying both the Billionaire Roll (japanese waygu beef, snow crab, asparagus, soy aioli, truffle garlic butter, gold flake) and the Sumo Green Roll (wood grilled mushrooms, avocado, crispy plantain chip, veg. caviar+ aji amarillo) on a future visit.  The meet and veggies will balance each other out, right?!  The brunch menu looks interesting as well... especially if you're in the mood for bottomless mimosas, micheladas, or bloody mary's with your meal.  I hope to try that sometime!  A couple of things to note to keep expectations in check: SumoMaya is loud... it's difficult to hear everyone if you have a large group, so know that going in.  Also, their tap water tastes a little off... I noticed that on all of my visits.  Perhaps a tool they have to get guests to drink more cocktails?!",

The prices are what you would expect for a place in Scottsdale, but for lunch it was a little expensive, even for Scottsdale. I got the foie gras + eel roll, and a piece of mackeral sashimi and uni. The uni and roll were alright, nothing spectacular about either of them. But the mackerel sashimi was just terrible. I get sushi for lunch frequently, and mackeral sashimi or nigiri is usually something I always get. It should be a little moist, and it should look shiny and fresh...this piece looked like it had been cooked because it looked curled up like how it might look if it was left on the grill for a few seconds. It did not have the texture and taste it should have, quite frankly, the mackeral sashimi was gross.  This place isn't awful, and I've only been here once and tried a few things, but I highly doubt I'll be back. The food isn't terrible,  it just doesn't justify the prices that they charge...",

The tacos are pretty good but i highly suggest their asian food over the mexican.  The rolls are also delicious and fresh- try the dragon roll with crab substitute instead of tuna. I honestly expected the prices to be more outrageous considering the atmosphere but they're not too bad. If you go on a weekend night expect a younger crowd loud music and dim lights. It's a really fun time but just know what you're in for. The bar has two huge screen tvs so it's a fun place to watch a game. The drinks are all so unique and always tasty you can't go wrong with any of them. Edit: We went for an anniversary and made the reservation through open table so I was able to add in the occasion. They surprised us with complimentary champagne and chocolate cake. The staff is awesome!",

We have never been to SumoMaya before but decided to give the happy hour a shot. Wow, it did not disappoint! The food was so good and flavorful! We ordered the guacamole, that they make right when you order it. We also got the calamari, which had peas and chili sauce mixed with it but all the flavors meshed well. The burger was fantastic and the chicken enchilada suizas were my favorite. They were so light for enchiladas, which is nice for lunch. Overall everything was amazing and I would love to come back one day to try the full menu.",

I'll update on the food after we order  Ok, I ordered their new rice dish. It was a cross between a paella and fried rice. It was a touch spice in a perfect way with shrimp, crab, pulled pork and a sunny side egg served in a beautiful statement piece hot pot that has been baked in the oven for hours. YUMMY!!!!",

    "text": "This restaurant is HILARIOUS.  Vacationed in Scottsdale for the first time this past Memorial Day weekend on a whim because my boyfriend and I wanted to get out of LA. Came here for our first dinner in Scottsdale and it's like we were right smack in the middle of douchebaggy West Hollywood (the exact type of scene we were trying the escape). I literally walked in, heard the top 40 music BLASTING over the entire restaurant and it took every ounce of strength in me to simultaneously hold back my laughter and tears.  Anyway, we decided to stay because idk maybe it was my fault for not reading the reviews thoroughly enough to figure out that this was like some sort of tacky wannabe club/lounge-type restaurant that thinks it's in Hollywood. We only waited about 10 minutes to be seated by the sushi bar, so we were like ok cool, let's just eat and get the FUCK out of here.  We ordered: -Al pastor tacos: the sizes of these tacos are joke right? Like, you guys can't actually be serious? 2 tacos for $8 when you can go to a taco truck and get one for $1 that is double the size. I'm hella offended. -Maya roll: the only decent item we ordered, but definitely not worth $15 -Chinese chili garlic noodles: tasted like spicy dry ramen noodles and the portion was so small + it took about 30 minutes to come out.  We weren't even that hungry when we got there but neither of us were satisfied after ordering 3 dishes, which would typically be enough at any other restaurant... right? We would have ordered another item, but we didn't want to feed this establishment any more money than we needed to and also wanted to leave ASAP.  I must admit that it was definitely priceless watching middle-aged yuppies go completely batshit over the basketball game while ordering $50 sushi rolls with gold flakes???? Also enjoyed watching the table of literal senior citizens across from us trying to have a nice dinner with Drake's \"Hotline Bling\" blaring out of the sound system. Thank you SO much for the snapchat content!   To my surprise, a restaurant can concurrently be obnoxious, absurdly loud, incredibly over-priced, unreasonably slow, and also have TINY portions! Honestly, I'm impressed with how they seem to still draw a crowd of patrons who seem to be completely oblivious to exactly how much they are being ripped off.",

From the minute we walked in, we loved the ambiance, the music, the tree, the chairs.....and then we tried the happy hour tacos and couldn't even talk, they were so good!   The fusion all night of Mexican food with Asian influence and vice versa had us flipping the menu back and forth trying to decide what was next!   The signature drinks were so good, we ended up trying a half dozen different drinks...all original and amazing!  But the best part of the night was our server Brittany Sines!   We ended up being there almost 5 hrs and she was just the right amount of attentive, made great recommendations and the highlight of the night was when she helped create a new after dinner drink!   We've been here dining out all week and tonight this restaurant and Brittany have been the absolute highlight!!!  Can't wait to come back!!",

My friend who is 68 and overweight/obese/ or whatever term you choose to describe was strictly informed  high tops for HH.  We respectfully abided by SumoMaya's discrimination rules.   Once seated at the basic table,  I visited the \"empathetic\"hostess and asked for the HH menu and to speak to the manager. She reinstated that it was not allowed.  I asked, what would you do if she was in a wheel chair and she chimed back, that would be different!   The  manager eagerly greeted our table and bluntly asked, \" What is the problem?\"  As discretely as possible I politely asked, Could you please honor HH at our typical table?   He elaborated  he would make an exception only once. No worries we will not be back.",

Then we decided we didn't want brunch so we called and said brunch is over at 2pm so we rebooked for then. We got there and hand us brunch menus bc we got there at 145 and I said no we will get drinks till 2pm and the girl said fine. Then our server comes and says 2pm is just appetizers and brings us this tiny appetizer menu. One of the ladies didn't eat bc there was nothing on there she liked. I barely ate bc I didn't care for much on there. When we called why didn't hey say only appetizers from 2-430. Our server was rude and I had a friend in from out of town who really wanted to try the tacos and food on the regular menu. That's why we came at the time we did. Honestly the ppl that answer the phone need to  know and the hosts as well what hours everything is. At this point I will not come on a weekend ever again when this brunch is going on. Very disappointed !",

Now to the food; I wouldn't say I'm a picky eater at all I LOVE everything to be honest but this time was odd...  Everything we tried was just SO different that I couldn't tell if it was an acquiring taste or just not that good. We had the apple-salmon roll and it was good but not great. Adding to that we had the Chinese spicy crab and garlic noodles, SO SPICY! (By the way, I love everything hot and this was crazy)  All in all, the restaurants vibes were amazing but the food was just very different.

The light dusting of sauce made it very yummy, and not to much breading so that was delicious.  So next was the taco's which I was dying to try.  So we ordered 4 different ones.  The first was the Korean Beef Taco everyone was raving about.  Was good, don't get me wrong but seemed to lack a certain something.  The wild mushroom taco was our favorite as it was bursting with mushrooms, flavor and had enough creme sauce to take away any dryness.  Third taco up was the tempura cod- which again seemed to lack any flavor but the fish was cooked well as was the vegetables and guac.    Lastly was the Pork taco that looked the best but couldn't taste any of the pineapple flavor or salsa but only the pickled onion and guac.     One the plus side, the cocktails are poured perfectly!  Won't give up since everyone has good days and bad days so there are lots of other items to give it a chance",

    "text": "SumoMaya's happy hour is a great way to sample some of their dishes and flavors. They have $3, $5 and $7 dollar food choices, including the tacos. Beer, wine and specialty cocktails are all discounted. And I love the fact that they have their happy hour on the weekends too!  It's a really fun space, we sat at the bar, but would like to go back and sit on the patio when it isn't 115 degrees out. The staff were friendly and efficient.   We had the: - togarashi spiced popcorn, so good! slightly citrusy and also buttery, I could have eaten a giant bowl of it. - salmon avocado roll, good, very nicely presented. A basic sushi roll, the salmon was good quality. - crispy calamari, really good! tender squid, not greasy. Tossed in a sweet chili garlic sauce with sesame seeds. The also threw some cherry tomato halves and peas into the mix.  - tacos - we tried 3, the sesame ginger chicken, Korean beef and pork al pastor. The pork was definitely the best, the fresh pineapple really went nicely with the pork. The chicken was our next favorite, but you could mainly taste the ginger slaw. The Korean beef was disappointing, we thought it would have the most flavor, but it had the least, very boring.  The Jalapeno Monk margarita was great, spicy and sweet, it also had cucumber, which was refreshing.  Overall we would definitely go back, especially for happy hour!",

Wow the pork belly ramen bowl is da bomb especially when you add a traditional egg where when broken, thick gooey egg yolk oozes out and mixes with the soup making the experience feel like you're sitting in a small ramen house in the middle of Nagoya but you're not, you're in the dessert! Ha! The Korean tacos is phenomenal as it meshed traditional marinated Korean beef and the Hispanic fixings of a traditional taco. Wash your food down with a Sake Sangria and you are good to go! Now...if only this place fuses a dish from the Philippines, now that would be nice especially when one of it's roots is Spanish.",

    "text": "The appetizers are great! The guacamole, ceviche and calamari was different and very tasty.  Excellent presentation while marrying the flavors well. Portions are smaller and served tapas style. The plantains were great however, I don't think the vinaigrette worked out there. I could have done without the sauce. I like what they did with the chips though. That made a lasting effect.   I would definitely suggest making a reservation however, we did get in very quickly on a Sunday night. Trendy spot but has a very casual feel to it.   I would definitely come back when I'm in town. There's a wide variation of food that everyone can appreciate. Really great place.   Complimentary valet parking. Great service.",

Our party was vegetarian and we ordered almost every veggie item on the menu and it did not disappoint. The chef also made us veggie tacos which were delicious.  The mexican corn was absolutely incredible and I loved the guacamole with the large tortilla chips. Cocktails were also delicious - I had the golden triangle and it was refreshing with a hint of spice.  Will most definitely be back and tell everyone I know about it.",

We tried most of the starters and weren't disappointed! The bread migas, the oatmeal, black bean hummus dip and the guacamole. We were not disappointed! As for entrees we had the following:  The chicken enchilada suizas....im not usually a fan of the verde sauce but this was delish  Huevos Rancheros, the dish did not disappoint the sauce and tortilla were good!  Churro Waffle, it was a cinammon waffle topped with a choclate ice cream that was a hint of spicy...tasty!  Torta ...not as excited about this entree. There was more to meat. Can't say we will be getting that one next time.  The blood orange mimosa and passion fruit mimosas were just right.  Will def be back!",

Why is it when my friend and I always find a new place, start become regulars and menu and prices change, all within 2 weeks since we were there... so sad!   My friend and I come here at lunch for the sushi. Last time we were here, I ordered the Chirashi Bowl, 14 pieces of chef choice fish, it was good not fantastic, presentation lacking, creativity lacking, that was 2 weeks ago!  We came yesterday for a late lunch Happy Hour, had to sit at the bar area for HH. We took advantage of the menu along with ordering some of our favorite Sushi, didn't bother checking the sushi menu because we always order the same items, Uni, Yellow Tail, Salmon, Eel Nigiri. When the order came. We had half our sushi, unknowingly they changed the menu and increased all pricing, now PRICE per piece! Uni doubled in $$  Food was still good, service at the bar at HH was excellent, just not so Happy with menu changes and $$ change for sushi.",

Even the churro waffle that came with chocolate ice cream was spicy, tons of cinnamon in the chocolate ice cream that's not indicated on the menu.

The fusion Mexican Asian was pretty interesting but I thought everything went well together. This place is tapas style so we got to order a bunch of dishes. On top of my head I remember the ceviche, the guac, the tacos and the kimchi fried rice.  It's definitely a fun place to have drinks and food. If you are not in the \"party\" mood I would go some place else because the music and the place itself gets pretty loud. It was a bit challenging to have a conversation.",

Such a cool place to celebrate birthday , they have fun things for birthday , shots and fireworks in the middle of it , delicious dessert with fireworks .  The atmosphere of restaurant is just so unique and different , It's a beautiful place for a date. They have such a romantic place under real trees which make it so special. They take a reservation, so if you are gonna make a reservation be sure you asked for a table that he under trees.   This Saturday when I was there they had a wonderful band there. I would've just pay to go and see that band.  I love this restaurant because it gives you both choices if you wanna eat sushi you can if you wanna have Mexican food you can. I love the idea that you can see the kitchen in front of you .   Their unlimited brunch is a bomb. For only $29 per person .Perfect thing to do as a group or a date. You can have unlimited delicious appetizer + 1 choice of entree + unlimited sides + unlimited dessert, in top of that your call to have unlimited mimosas, margarita , Bloody Mary .  On top of delicious drink and food what makes me to be sure to get back there was our waiter,Alec . He was not neglected us and while he was so busy there he still serves us wonderful way.   Oh and of course they have a complimentary Valet that makes everything so much better.  Can't wait to get back there. Definitely suggested to go there if you wanna try something unique , fancy and nice .",

Bloody Mary was delicious with a slight spicy kick to it! Served with an olive and lemon. Our waitress did a great job of making sure no one had an empty drink.  Our table's favorites.  Step 1: -Pomegrante Guacamole  -Sushi roll  Step 2: -pad Thai -poke bowl -fried chicken sandwich  Dessert was delicious. Don't let liquid cheesecake deter you. It's more like a custard. Tip: dip the fried dough dessert in the cheesecake. It's a delicious pairing!  Service was exceptional!",

Every time, the dishes have been quite obviously dirty, chunks of dried on old food.  The food, I would say is just okay, guacamole is good. I would stay away from the sushi, color didn't seem right on my tuna roll, and texture was off....and that is usually a steady dish for me.  Each time I was there, they were having an issue with the beer tappers so it would take 15 min of foam dumping before I could get a cool-ish (not cold) beer. Service is hit or miss, takes a relatively long time to get acknowledged at the bar even when it isn't busy.  I'm giving Sumo Maya an overall thumbs down. Cool concept, but just too many little things that are wrong. Much higher quality places to eat and drink nearby, I would recommend going to one of those.",

THIS is the place you go for such occasions.   The restaurant is simply beautiful. Perhaps you may feel like you're sitting on a plaza in Mexico City. Big Night time, for sure! We sat in front of a tree, with a view of the open kitchen. I don't always love having a view of an open kitchen, but it felt totally fine here, almost a natural extension of the dining area.  I had been up for a zillion hours, so although the cocktail list beckoned with such delightful concoctions as a Hibiscus Mezcalrita, I stuck to a glass of wine. There are plenty of options to wet your whistle and it's your celebration, remember!  Let's chat about the vegan options, shall we? Note that the menu indicates vegetarian items, but not vegan. Just ask your server. On that note, a place of improvement would definitely be to educate servers on which items can be made dairy/egg-free.  Time to gush on that pomegranate guacamole before anything else. Unreal. I could have had a platter of it, quite honestly. If I lived in the area, I would come back here and ask if they could make guac tacos for me. I loved the tart slightly sweet pom seeds complimenting the richness of the guac. This was my absolute favorite thing in a meal of many tasty things.  My dining companions agreed that eggplant can sometimes be iffy (but then put in orders for two on the recommendation of yelpers.) When it's good, it's sublime, but it can often be so so tragically wrong. You know what I mean. Here, it's sweet with a miso glaze. I'll admit it wasn't perfection (a bit too chewy for my liking) but the flavor is excellent.   Not as exciting to write about, but the mixed greens with ginger dressing is fresh and tasty. The perfect healthy compliment if you're going to town on stuff like chips and guac!  The visually appealing Arroz Verde is just as delicious as it looks. I might have eaten it down to the final grain of rice! I loved the texture fiesta- perfectly cooked and seasoned rice, mushrooms and edamame. This is a light dish as well, and thoroughly satisfying.  Note that most of your vegan options would be the rice dishes and if you just go by the menu, a basic sushi roll. But! There's a secret veggie roll that you won't find on there, thanks to our fabulous waitress' tip. It's a crunchy AAC (possibly with pickle as well) and is topped with thinly sliced avocado. Outstanding!   Our group thoroughly enjoyed our time here. I'd gladly go back when  I'm in town for pom guac (two orders, ahem), the arroz verde and secret vegan roll. SumoMaya can always make you feel like you're on vacation or celebrating a big win!",

Initially there were three of us there so we kept having to ask for appetizers rather than them just being brought out like when the party became 6.  Now im writing this to ask a redundant question, because there were several other parties of white women present for longer than a 2 hr allotment. Are parties/tables asked to leave after they have been in the establishment for two hours? Bc after our table full of women of color, paid for our bill, abt 10 mins later we were asked to leave. Not by a manager but by our waitress. And it wasnt like a \"hey youve been here for two hrs\" instead a \"my manager asked that you leave, we have other reservations, etc.\" Ok, and? This was extremely rude after we had just spent $300 in this establishment and there were plenty of other tables for reservations or parties to sit.  Ive been here a few times and always feel unwelcome, so i wont be back. I gave two stars for Ashley and Huevos rancheros.",

We split their shrimp ceviche and calabacitas guacamole - both dishes were exploding with flavor and so dang  dreamy. For my entree, I ordered their Pad Thai with al pastor pork (yes, you heard me right!) and it was honestly one of the best things that i've eaten out in a LONG time. Like I will be craving this for weeks to come!  I love the colorful, hip atmosphere, unique cocktails and entrees, and overall, it is a MUST when in Scottsdale. I can't wait to come back again soon!

We ordered some starters to share and then some individual entrees. This is definitely a spot conducive to sharing, and I highly recommend trying as much as you can on your visit (absolutely everything was delish)!  The miso eggplant was the star of the evening, in my opinion. This is an absolute must-order and one of the best Asian style vegetables I have ever had. Still day dreaming about it a week later. I didn't order any sushi myself and had major FOMO once some other attendees had theirs brought out. I went with the fish tacos and Mexican street corn - which is served with popcorn on top and doused in a cream/butter sauce (not great for your waistline but holy COW).   Prices were super reasonable and I cannot wait to eat that miso eggplant again the next time I'm in AZ. The cocktail list is also expansive, so be sure to imbibe with your tapas/meal. Cheers!",

The chicken wings were good - spicy!  The pomegranate guacamole was also delicious. The grilled street corn was terrible.... i hated it. The Peruvian corn was ever worse - it's giant corn soup! The al pastor tacos were good, as were the kimchi tacos.  The pad Thai was nothing special, and the fried rice was even less special.  These Asian dishes did not wow me at all. It honestly kind of just tasted like takeout. Sad face.  If I came back, I'd come back for the lychee martini, the chicken wings and the guacamole.

    "text": "I'm really torn on what to give SumoMaya for a rating.  I'd heard so much about this place so I decided to check it out before I left town.  I walked into Sunday brunch and sat at the bar.  The good thing about this was they had their endless brunch menu and I definitely got my $29 worth. The bad thing was I really didn't want brunch food and the only other options was some sushi that looked ridiculously overpriced and the same brunch items available a la cart.  So endless brunch it was.  The black bean hummus was delicious.  I don't know if I would call it hummus though. It tasted like pureed black beans and chimichurri.  I didnt get any tahini, olive oil, or really even garlic flavor out it.  Tahini is a must for hummus. And chimichurri usually has garlic.  Let's just call it black bean dip, it was good.  And the accompanying \"chips\" were delicious. Nothing like fried tortillas on property!  The pomegranate guacamole was ok.  I would have liked more heat and maybe more cilantro.  The addition of pomegranate was a nice touch though.  Once again the chips were on point.  I understand you cant be giving out your best sushi when it's part of an all you can eat but I feel like there was some room for improvement here.  The veggie roll doesn't constitute sushi in my book.  The tuna roll was delicious, the tuna tasted fresh.  The other roll was surprisingly delicious as well.  I would have enjoyed a 4th type of sushi or something subbed in for the \"veggie thingy\".    For my main entree I chose the Wagyu steak and eegs.  I should have known something was up when I wasn't asked how I wanted my steak cooked.  The steak was skirt steak or flank steak which I don't associate with steak and eggs but I guess it is steak afterall.  The meat was ok but being skirt steak it was difficult to cut it not into jerky like strips.  Now about the eggs...I had to look to make sure the menu says steak and eggs, it does.  There was 1 egg.  This was steak and egg, not eggs.  The egg was cold.  It could have been the temperature of the coconut miso sauce poured over it or it could have just sat in the window too long.  Overall the temperature was a little on the cold side.  Flavor was there but I dont think I would order it again.  Endless brunch comes with a dessert so I opted for the liquid cheesecake and I'm glad I did. Phenomenal! I highly recommend it!  It wasn't too sweet and was the perfect amount.   Service was atrocious! Like most places I visited in Scottsdale service was non-existent.  Keep in mind I was sitting at the bar, by the service well.  Plates sat finished pushed forward in front of me multiple time.  I watched the bartenders walk by multiple times without paying attention.  Managers and other servers waiting for their drinks in front of me and still plates would sit there for 5+ minutes.  I was hardly checked up on.  My water was empty 2 times and bartenders would just walk by.  I understand bartenders get busy, but with the bottomless drinks that were going out for the bottomless brunch, they were all prebatched! With the exception of the bloody Mary which the bloody Mary mix was prebatched, it was still vodka and prebatch.  There's no reason why that service well was that backed up and the bartenders were that oblivious to the customers at the bar.    Overall ambiance was 4 stars.  It was very lively and the decor was beautiful.  Food was 4 stars. Service was honestly 1 star. Value for bottomless brunch was 5 stars.    I'm going to rate SumoMaya 4 stars for now.  I would love to come back at dinnertime and try some of the other items.  If you're on a budget I highly recommend SumoMaya for brunch as it's a great bang for your buck.",

Aaron was our server and was the absolute best! He was attentive, funny and made sure to keep checking in on us. We just the most amazing time thanks to him!! We had mimosas, prickly pear and pomegranate flavored. They were so good and they gave us the flavoring on the side so we could choose to pour however much we wanted in our drink. The sushi and oatmeal were our two fave starters and for the entree the steak and eggs were DELICIOUS. They brought out this liquid cheesecake for dessert with the sparkler on top which was of course fun! And omg the dessert was to die for. I came here a few years ago and didn't have the greatest experience, but I'm glad I came back and gave it another shot! I look forward to coming back for another fun brunch experience :)",

    "text": "Visiting from Chicago for our babymoon and heard a lot of rave reviews about SumoMaya. We decided to give it a try one of the nights we were in and were blown away! I was a little wary at first with the menu, wondering whether I'd be able to eat much that was available, but it was not a problem at all.   We started with the Calabacitas guacamole based on the recommendation from our waitress and we were surprised at how much we loved it! Chunks of squash mixed into the guac kept surprising us - if you're a texture eater like I am, you've got to try this. We both loved it. We ended up splitting the main dishes we ordered because we wanted to try as much as we could - we ordered the Seafood Rice Mariscada (basically paella), Korean Beef tacos, and Al Pastor tacos and loved every single bite. The tacos were difficult to pick which ones were better...just get both if you're on the fence :) We absolutely loved the flavors in the paella, too. Perfect amount of seafood to rice ratio!   We're keeping our fingers crossed that SumoMaya opens a location in Chicago as our server suggested...we will be the first in line to dine if/when it does.",

    "text": "During a weekend trip to Scottsdale, we went here based on recommendations from friends.   First, the hostess was extremely friendly. We had just gotten in from the airport, had a couple of hours left before we could check into our AirBnb, and had a huge suitcase with us. The hostess graciously offered to let us leave our suitcase by her register, so that we could eat in peace.  Second, the decor in this place - wow! It is seriously SO cute. I love the chairs (clear, with faces on them) were super creative. The whole design is really modern. Also, I love the fact that there is a huge, random tree in the middle of everything. It's so fun!   Third, the pomegranate guacamole was light and refreshing, and very different. It was cool because I have not had a mixture of flavor like that before; however, if you order this, definitely request limes and maybe a pinch more salt. It would have been perfect if it had more lime and extra salt.   Fourth, the rainbow ceviche was refreshing. The best part of the ceviche was the tuna. Thus, if you are able to request it with JUS the tuna, I would recommend doing that.   Fifth, my FAVORITE, the ELOTE was PHENOMENAL. I am obsessed with elote and this was seriously one of the best I've had.  Sixth, I recommend either the Watermelon Margarita, or the Spicy Peach. Both are delicious.",

    "text": "The atmosphere of this place is so unique and hip. It sort of reminds me of Vegas, but everything would cost twice as much there! There's a beautiful giant tree inside and although it's not real, it's still breathtaking.   I started with a hibiscus mezcarita. I'm a huge fan of mezcal and tequila mixed together, so anytime I see it on a menu, my eyes gravitate towards it. This one did not disappoint. It came complete with a beautiful purple flower on top. It was as stunning as it was delicious! Highly recommend.   For the meal, we started with a bunch of appetizers. By far, the eggplant was my favorite, which I'm surprised by. I'm Italian, and my family makes eggplant parm probably 5 times a month and I never have it. Maybe it was because I was in a setting with my coworkers and I didn't want to get a little judged for being Italian and NOT like eggplant (can you image the look of shock?). So I went for it. And I'm sure glad I did. It was the best I've ever had (sorry, mom). The flavor was so delicious that they didn't even need to disguise it with a ton of sauce and cheese.  For dinner, instead of opting into my usual go-to tacos, I decided to try the Chinese Sausage and Pineapple bowl. I'm so glad I did. It was incredible! The pineapple was such a great sweet flavor to the dish.   Great spot for sure! Definitely will be back when I come visit again.",

The place was not busy, the decor is modern and fun however, the music was so loud you couldn't think. We asked the server three times to turn it down but no luck. The drinks were fair, and took 15 minutes to get to the table. I can't imagine how long it would take if it were busy! The food was tasty, but the taco portion sizes were ridiculous for the money. Half the size of a normal taco and twice the cost. We had 2 small tacos, 1 order of sushi and 1 drink each, totaling $60!  Would not recommend and will not be back. Very surprised at the 4 star reviews. There are plenty of other trendy Scottsdale restaurants that surpass this place. Very very disappointing.",

The food was good but nothing amazing but the most disappointing part of the experience was the service.  It was as if the waitress was going through training or should go through training.  She took a long time to come back every time we ordered something and our drinks sat at the bar for 10 min before I asked another server to bring them to us.  Every part of the mail was disjointed.  I think there was a manager on duty but all she did was walk around and talk to the bartenders it did not seem she has any idea of what was going on.  I think it would be a good idea for leadership to review their systems and staff and determine how they could be more efficient.  I wish them the best but until these systems are in place I will not be going back.   Sincerely  Very disappointed customer",

    "text": "SumoMaya combines a party atmosphere, a bar, and a sit down restaurant all into one. For those looking for somewhere hip to drink and/or eat, you've definitely come to the right place!  We ordered enough food quite possibly for a small army, including 2 types of guacamole, sushi rolls, ceviche, kimchee fried rice, various tacos, and chile-crab garlic noodles. The sushi roll we had (Shishito roll) was just average. The slight bitter flavor of the shishito pepper, which can be a delectable taste for the senses when roasted, didn't quite mesh with the sweetness of the kiwi + mango-habanero sauce for me. Other fusion items we had were tantalizing though. Some notable dishes were the Singapore crab noodles and the al pastor tacos. The strong flavors of the meat with seasoning contrasted well with the starch component in each dish.  For dessert, they have various options such as cheesecake, mochi, and chocolate cake.   Service was decent for a bustling and busy weekend night. One of the co-owners came by to check up on us and see how we were enjoying things, a nice touch!  Since this is such a vibrant atmosphere, it's not quite the place you'd want to take someone for an intimate evening where you can engage in deep conversation, especially when Kris Kross's \"Jump\" is playing on the loudspeakers (Admit it- you know you'd want to jump along with the music!). :)",

After 15 minutes of communicating with the manager about our concern he let us know he would take off the tab the \"shots\" we ordered. I felt cheated because his intention was to charge us $10 a shot when 14 is the 25 were water. It was bizarre and rude. I love this restaurant but Mike would not take responsibility for what happened when we were kind customers with a brunch party of 25 people... very disappointed.

    "text": "Upon walking in you can't help notice the tree centered in the restaurant, I love the look and vibe of this place.  My friend and I started with some drinks, we got the Sumo-Rita and the Loaded Mule. My loaded mule was pretty good, the flavor profile of cucumber with passionfruit, seemed like a really good twist on typical Moscow Mule. Don't get me wrong, it was good but it just didn't really wow me as much as I had hoped. The Sumo-Rita was really refreshing and light, it was so good!   For food we got the crab guacamole, shishito roll, rock shrimp tempura roll, coconut ahi tuna tartar and the pork belly ramen. It probably seems like a lot of food but the portions are somewhat on the small side and we really wanted to try a variety of things.   The Shishito roll was really average, and although the the ingredients seem really unique it sort of just over complicates things. You'd think a roll with shishito peppers, kiwi-mango sauce, avocado and salmon would be really complex but all you end up tasting is a slight bitterness from the peppers and mango.  The rock shrimp tempura roll was somewhat like your normal shrimp tempura roll but dressed up a bit. Not bad by any means but I'd try other items if I ever came back. The crab guac was okay but it was kinda bland. The crab was just put on top and seemed like an afterthought.   The coconut tuna tartar was pretty good, the coconut wasn't over powering, super crispy plantain chip and bonus points because the presentation was gorgeous. The pork belly ramen was unexpectedly my favorite dish I tried that night. The pork belly was super tender while the broth was really deep with pork and mushroom flavor.   Overall the SumoMaya was pretty good. Although some of the food we got was average there were so many items on the menu that seems interesting I'd probably come back to try new things.",

    "text": "Few places really deliver on 'Asian Fusion', and SumoMaya was one of those that didn't. The 'fusion' dishes just tasted like asian food gone awry.   We started with the the Pumpkin Seed Guacamole which was good, but nothing particularly different/unique I was excited about the Sushis since they seemed really interesting, but the Soft Shelled Crab roll just didn't deliver. I'm normally someone who loves all the specialty sushi rolls I eat, but the flavor combinations just didn't match up and notes accentuated in the wrong places.  We also tried the Al Pastor Pad Thai. My fiancee loves pad thai and loves his Al Pastor, but again the medley just didn't work for us.  The only dish we liked was our side - the Miso Eggplant, which was well flavored.   Great cocktail, margarita, beer and wine menu. I liked my Coconut cocktail which kind of tasted like a melted pina colada.  We also felt we overpaid for the quality and taste of the food. $80 for not enjoying our main dishes was not a good eal. Too many other great small plates places in the Scottsdale area.   The ambience is also confusing. It's swanky and would be a neat place to hang out but it was also trying too hard to be a Vegas nightclub. There's a DJ on his laptop upon entry, playing club music that made me want to dance on the tables, but also sports showing on TVs above the bar.  Not a good place for a first date or anything where you want to hear the other person.",

Not only do they do a stellar job at Japanese- Mexican fusion, but they also achieve an eclectic Alice-in-Wonderland type of feel, with a tree in the middle of the restaurant and hot pink chairs and portraits of Japanese and Mexican ancestors sprinkled everywhere. Aside from this, they also have a killer brunch. I had heard through friends that the brunch at SumoMaya was amazing, but they absolutely defied my expectations.  First of all they take the concept of bottomless brunch from drinks and apply it to food. But what results is not some boring breakfast buffet-like meal - it's better. The structure of the meal is three courses, with unlimited ordering for the first course and the third course. What exactly does this mean? All you can eat dessert, and all you can eat apps! Oh, and all you can eat sides, too if your stomach can handle it.  For apps they have everything from sushi rolls to pomegranate guac to chorizo scramble. If you don't already fill up on these, because they are divine, then you can move on to your entree. The entree list is overwhelming. It took us about ten minutes to order because we just could not decide. There is everything from sweet potato waffles to a Cubano sandwich to coconut pancakes with spicy mangos. We finally ordered the salmon omelette and the wagyu steak with the poached egg. Oh my gosh the salmon melted in my mouth! My only critique was the steak was a little over-seasoned but we ate everything anyway. And holy cow, how we had room for dessert I'll never know but the cheesecake is like biting into light, creamy deliciousness. (It's still healthy because it comes with fruit right? Because we definitely capitalized on the unlimited on this one...) Overall, this is the best deal ever, it's only $29 for the meal itself and an extra $10 if you want the unlimited drinks. I'm so excited to go back and try other items on the menu!",

    "text": "Food--interesting combinations and flavors! Loved the bacon-wrapped dates and enjoyed the Korean Beef tacos as well as the Pork Belly sushi roll.  My favorite item was the Sizzling Chaufa Rice--such unique flavors!  Not very happy with the lobster ceviche (a bit tough and no crisps or bread or chips to scoop it up with) and very disappointed with the Pina Colada dessert (tough pineapple and cake was small and rubbery; coconut sorbet was yummy though and they did take it off the menu).  Finally, the margaritas were so small and two of them in succession did not even get me a little bit buzzed (for $24 I expect some jazz).  The atmosphere is cool -- love the tree but it's very loud after 7 pm when Sir Mix-A lot starts playing the tunes (Saturday) and the hard plastic chairs are horrible!  Our service was fine but I thought the food came out a bit quickly.  Overall, I can't really say I'll be returning anytime soon.",

I can tell you that dinner, lunch, brunch or happy hour here is a must! Our servers ( I could of sworn we had multiple servers  because of all the attention on our table) were amazing! We started with recommended cocktails, and beers. I had the shogun (was amazing) and my girlfriend had the new skinny margarita. A party in her mouth!! They have a stellar tequila collection and we definitely delved into it. I highly  recommend the carne asada and the street corn (with popcorn!) My girl had the white fish ceviche and she was amazed! Best place to ever celebrate my buddies birthday and me receiving my doctorate! Dan our server was the cherry on top of our experience!",

You aren't able to switch between beverages on the list, so if one drinks mimosas, you drink the mimosas the entire time. They tasted like Andre with a watered down juice mixture.   The food was not unique or satisfying. We ordered sushi rolls which ended up being pretty much vegetarian with the minute slice of salmon in one piece. As for the entrees, I can make better hollandaise sauce at home. The dessert was, however, satisfying- a creamy uncaramelized creme brulee wth fresh fruit.  When looking at quality vs quantity, SumoMaya fails in both areas. This is a place where they want you to think it's high class with the prices, but don't waste your money.",

Our waitress was so nice though and talked to her manager so the people in my party who wanted a la carte could have it. For the brunch it was endless sides/starters, and they were amazing. Unfortunately though we didn't receive all of them. When we told our waitress this, she claimed she brought them to us, when really, we never received them. She then fixed it and brought the food we didn't get. It's ok though, the food is amazing and I will definitely return for dinner. The atmosphere is gorgeous too! :)",

    "text": "I had been waiting for this restaurant to open because I believe that Asian and Latin food fusion makes a great combination.  We went there first for happy hour; since I couldn't stay long, I ordered the mushroom tacos.  The mushrooms were delicious but nothing on the menu said it would be spicy - but it was VERY spicy.  Finally figured out that the onions are pickled with serrano chilis and that's probably what I bit into that made the taco so SPICY. Next time, I asked that they \"hold\" anything spicy but the kitchen can't seem to know what is spicy and and what is not.  According the bartender: \"Well, what's spicy to you, may not be spicy to them\" and that's when I decided that as good as a couple of the dishes I've had, it wasn't going to be the next great find in my list. The kitchen can manage to make the Pad Thai al Pastor mild enough for me to enjoy and in another visit I also enjoyed the Chicharron de Pollo that I ordered and shared with my friend.  She ordered the Bacon Wrapped Medjool Dates.  The Guacamoles were not dissappointing but again, very spicy.  We tried the Lump Crab and Bacon. There was one dish (I believe it was the meatballs with soup) that apparently taken out of the menu because in the 5 times I went there, they were never serving it. I will likely go again as it seems to be popular with my friends but unfortunately, not the place I expected.",

Every dish was cooked to perfection. The pork belly was a treat and the sea bass went really fast. If you're feeling decadent, and I often am when I'm out, try the billionaire roll. Way overpriced kobe beef roll that includes gold flake..Had to have it and it was stellar! Our server was busy but efficient and friendly.

It seemed at first tlike we weren't going to get the best service but once we all got settled our server was on top of everything...and my anxiety of not getting to our dinner at another friends house went down.    Anyway, the decor is really fun, bright colors and patterns, eclectic and cool with a lot of the latest (ghost chairs, ethnic striped backs for the booths, wood and metal) accents.  Two really cool decor items are the breathable walls made of faux ivy and the mirrors in the bathrooms made out of succulents.  Really fun. The food was amazing.  We didn't eat a lot (early dinner) but we tried everything the table ordered.  Two of the best:  Rock Shrimp Tempura and Shaking Beef.

I enjoyed the food as did the rest of the family. The downfall is the server was barely there. I don't like my meals rushed but it was to the point I didn't get to order a drink until 20 minutes in. Despite that I will definitely be back. Probably without the baby this time! Overall good time.",

I have to say, in the past few months the food tastes different. Not everything, but most items we have ordered no longer taste like they used to. The waiter suggested that it possibly has to do with some items now being gluten free?? The only item that still tastes the same and is delicious is the bacon guacamole. Always amazing and I highly recommend trying it! Everything is just blah. The service the past few times we've been has been soso.",

I deducted a star for our somewhat pretentious server, who didn't write down our order and then forgot two of our dishes.  I reminded him, and then he only brought one of them, then had our table cleared and asked if we wanted dessert. We said no, and as he was walking away, a waiter walked towards our table with our salad (the missing dish).  Our server whispered in his ear and sent him away.  Did he really think we didn't notice/forgot?  The right thing to do would have been to apologize and ask if we still wanted the dish.  Some maturity and grace, rather than trying to save face, would have gone much farther.",

The servings are mostly symbolic, we brought an appetite and left hungry. The battered cod tacos were tiny enough to be called taquitos with something resembling a fish stick in the center. I also had some unagi sushi and this unagi was poorly prepared. The waitress took the time to deride us at the end of our meal, mentioning that we should probably have ordered some sandwiches instead. The price tag was unreal, I felt ashamed for inviting a good friend along because he thought he's paying for the entire bill even though we went dutch. Pricey, tiny portions, lackluster service. Overall, I wish I never went there, period!",

The ramen was hearty and outstanding. Couldn't get enough of it and I continue to crave it. Also had soft shell crab sushi roll with Jabanero-Mango Sauce-  the pepper gave it a nice kick, as I am usually not too into sweet tastes overpowering my sushi. We ordered a soft shell Korean Beef Taco, 2 come with one order. They are small, but delicious. Guacamole selection is different here, you can get it with lump crab meat, chicharone, catija cheese, or corn, with house made tortilla flats for dipping. Place has a really cool vibe, and a tree grows in the middle.  Highly recommended.",

Were really glad we went the cheap-o route -- spending less on drinks and appetizers than we normally spend on wine, alone, at other places! -- because it was really hit-and-miss.   Free valet parking is a nice touch before you even walk in.    All the high-tops were taken, so we sat at the bar and encountered really disappointing service. Seemed the bartender was overwhelmed, both with the territory she had to cover and hiccups coming from the kitchen, so she wasn't the most welcoming sort.  Roasted pineapple marg and passion fruit sangria were nice. We tried three different types of tacos, all of which were good. The spicy tuna roll we had was, well, a spicy tuna roll...I was expecting something inventive, and didn't get it. The chicken chicharones were terrible -- basically just pieces of dry, unseasoned chicken breast rolled in corn meal and fried. The sauce they came with wasn't enough to overcome the dish's other shortcomings.  The place is clearly a magnet for 20-something tourists and Botox addicts, which though slightly weird is also mildly entertaining. I suppose we might come back for the cheap eats, but...probably not.",

It was one of the fastest meals I've ever had very rushed seemed like stuff was pre made even tho I don't believe it was but still nothing flavorful at all. Would like to point out one highlight of the meal but there was one maybe the cocktail.  Service was okay but once again very very rushed.",

    "text": "No no no!!! This place is just the worst. Now listen here, I am by no way a cheapskate when it comes to grub. I have many times spent a little over $100 for dinner for two, and when the food is special or just good I have no problem or regrets, but this place???   My wife ordered a chicken fried rice and it was good, as good as you can get at Panda Express or any Teriyaki Bowl place, but it cost double here, $12, no biggie, its a nice place.   I ordered the Tokyo Mule, it was a good drink, just as good as I have gotten at The Vig or any other restaurant bar pretty much... also $12, Ok ok, normally anywhere else they are $8 $9 or $10 tops I understand that they have to pay for the tree inside and the faces on the chairs, understandable.   This is the kicker, I ordered chicken tinga tacos, 2 for $8. Now when you say tacos in the usa my mind goes to the standard taco bell or del taco size soft tortilla. When my plate arrived (see picture attached) my eyes just opened wide, I couldnt belive what I was seeing and my wife looked at me anc chuckled, the \"tacos\" where not even the size of the palm of my hand, one bite literally and they were gone, the taste? Nothing special I cant get at Paquime or any other of the newish midscale hopster mexican food places that have popped up, these were 50 cent tacos at best.  My conclusion?, the tacos really ticked me off, just because you're in Scottsdale doesnt mean you can rip off people, heck! I've been to restautrants in Scottsdale where I have to take a to go box. If you have money to splurge and dont mind overpaying for small portions of food that tou can get somewhere else at lower prices and greater quantities then by all means, come to SumoMaya.  Oh, the service was great! Good fast service.",

The waiter was not only delightful but knowledgeable about everything on the menu. We started the dinner with an order of Mexican street corn which came decorated with popcorn. It was slightly hot but in the most amazing way. Next ordered 2 al pastor tacos and 2 pescado tacos. Both selections were delicious and simply just fresh on each ingredient. For my drink I ordered the Tokyo mule which came with a lil kick in it as well and in an very enjoyable way. Finished with arroz marisco dish that the waiter brought out in an artistic looking pot. Mixed the fried egg with a large spoon and this combination of flavors made out to be the reason why I'll return. The scenery is beautiful but the food is the real winner here",

Reasonably priced. Very happy.  Skip the spicy tuna roll and go to a more traditional sushi restaurant instead. Won't repeat order this one.  Pork pad thai was the most correctly priced item we ordered for quantity. Once again, very interesting flavors. Very happy.  Carne asada is a no. Tender. Very thiny sliced. For the quantity, exceedingly over priced. So-so on the flavor.  Not recalling the name of their \"extremely dense\" \"flourless\" chocolate desert. Chocolate cremo? Any way, skip it! The most disappointing item we tried. Dense? Maybe. Extreme chocolate flavor? Nope. It's topped with a catastrophe of gelatin which is, I believe, flavorless and very distracting. The gold flakes look attractive. But, who cares. And, no doubt that bumps the price of this thing into ridiculous. Fail here from a chocolate aficionado.   Would I return? Probably. Would it be on my \"must go back to\" list. No.",

The parking lot is 80% closed by barriers where they have 'complimentary' valet parking.  The indoor deco is cool. But it's so noisy! The bar seats are not moveable, so you need either yell to your friends or lean the whole body towards them. They have TV on, so good for sports fan.  sushi - ordinary, the uni one is not as fresh as other places I have tried. pork belly ramen - great broth, almost the best pork belly I have ever tried in US, however, the noodle is not good at all. It's way too hard as a fully cooked noodle. A mixed seafood dish (forgot the name) - very tiny portion! And pricy! (Compare to the price and portion, it's like a Michelin restaurant food, if you have had one before, but they sever over 7 dishes for one person, do I need to order 7 dishes here at one time?)  But it's Scottsdale, I guess everything is pricy. The sauce is really good, I just hope they can have more.  My coworker is from Mexico, and I'm from China. So she though this place is a great combination. She tried some tuna tacos, and she loves it. They definitely mixed Japanese elements into Mexican, but not the other ways though.",

Came here for dinner on a Monday night, and I was surprised at how busy it was (thats usually a great sign in my book). Started off with cocktails, I ordered the yuzu mule and my friend ordered the cocktail right above it, the cucumber infused mule. Good news is that the cocktails were very delicious.. bad news is that we definitely needed more than one, as we both agreed that we didn't feel or taste the alcohol.   Moving on to food. We ordered the rock shrimp and a roll to start. (I can't remember the roll's name, but it had tempura and asparagus in it).The rock shrimp was delicious although for $16.00 you only get two pieces.. oh scottsdale, I guess that's is to be expected. The sushi roll was delicious, although not too memorable, because I can't exactly remember what else was in it besides the two ingredients. We also ordered a big bowl of shrimp/crab fried rice to share, and although it was delicious I thought it was a bit too americanized for my taste due to the high level of sauce to rice ratio.   Overall, great place to eat and I will return.",

The tables are small which made putting all the tapas on the table difficult to navigate for serving. That part I didn't care for too much. We sampled a few of the different drinks off the drink menu and they were very interesting and tasty. It's very loud inside so not an ideal place for a meeting of any sorts. This seems more like a social place, to celebrate and have a good time or for a birthday celebration. The food was decent it - the ginger rice was my favorite. The pad Thai was a little bland but more plentiful for sharing than the ginger rice dish. Their valet parking is complimentary. Inside it's really cool with a giant tree in the middle of the restaurant. Again, a good vibe for socializing and having fun.",

As we walked in there was at the counter a DJ playing his music and the receptionist just standing there where I did not know who she was or if she was there just to be seen.  The restaurant was very loud and a fun and excitement vibe. We checked in and were seated within a few minutes.  The service was very good and helpful as she explained the menu very thoroughly.  We decided to order the Korean Tacos, Chilean Sea Bass and the Lobster and Crab Dynamite. Although all the portions were like tapas the food was very good.  The Korean Tacos were the size of street tacos but were packed with meat and other condiments.  The Chilean Sea Bass was excellent and grill with the little bit of crispy skin. The portion was very small also but yummy.  The Lobster and Crab Dynamite was also very good and not as spicy as thought when described by our waitress.  This place is very Scottsdale to the tilt. Did not hear great things about the sushi so we passed on it tonight but next time we come back may give it a try.  Will come back but maybe for lunch.",

The decor was really cute and modern/contemporary with a fun vibe; I definitely want to check it out on the weekends. I ordered a green tea to drink along with the Al Pastor tacos and a side of white rice and black beans. Oh yeah the guac. We definitely ordered the guac(the \"plain\" one), definitely was far from plain and I'm saying that in the absolute best way possible. This was the best guac ever. Next time I think I'm going to order the guac and a drink and be a happy camper. The food was good but the guac was phenomenal and it was served with some crispy corn tortilla shells with a chile/lime seasoning. Again the guac was phenomenal. We had the pleasure of having Zachary as our server and he was very awesome. He was super nice and personable and ensured we were good without being too overwhelming. Anyway.. I liked sumomaya for the most part, the plates were very small for the price tag but the guac and service makes up for it.",

    "text": "We go to a new restaurant about once a week and this past Wednesday (6/15/16) we went to try sumomaya. There's a good amount of parking and  it is easily visible from the street.   We walked in at 5pm and asked for a table for 4 people. The hostesses asked us if we had a reservation. We told them we didn't. After a few minutes they said they had a patio table but we would have to be gone by 7pm. We've never been told that we need to leave a restaurant by a certain time so I was a little taken aback. As it was over 100 degrees that day, I told the hostess that I was a bit hesitant to sit outside. She said \"well the musters and the fans are on so its not so hot\". Again, I was hesitant considering the restaurant wasn't super busy. I would say there were probably 20-25 open tables inside at this point. So I asked if there was any other options. After looking at what must have been her reservation list, she said \"okay I do have one table inside but again you have to leave by 7pm\".  I don't know why we didn't leave at this point.   We get seated and our waiter is very nice and attentive. He goes over the menus with us. We order an Ahi Tuna Tostada ($16) appetizer. 20 minutes later the appetizer has not arrived and I'm looking around trying to find our waiter. 5 minutes later a young man comes over and tells us that they are out of that appetizer, I think he said they were out of tostada chips. So we order another one, the Ahi Coconut Tuna Tartare ($18). At this point, I am again wondering why we did not leave.   The food style, per the waiter, is tapas style. Things come out as they are done so some of us got food earlier than others but it wasn't more than 7 minutes from when the first person got their food to the last person.   Ahi Coconut Tuna Tartare - our favorite dish. The ahi tuna is coated in a coconut curry and presented in a coconut shell with 2 plantain chips. Very flavorful. I actually wish they had more plantain chips. The saltiness paired well with the coconut ahi tuna. But for $18, this dish is definitely pricey for the amount you get.   I can only review the two dishes I had which were :  Rock shrimp tempura roll ($15) -  very tasty. Spicy tuna roll with shrimp tempura on top. Good sized roll Mexican Street Corn ($6) - I've had some amazing Mexican street corn and unfortunately this dish did not compare. I think it was a little too acidic compared to what I was expecting.   My husband got  Al Pastor Pad Thai ($14) - it was pretty good. He was a trooper because fusion is not usually his style. It wasn't a hit for him but I appreciated it.   The other people in our party got  Suzuki Roll ($13) - \"awesome\" Spicy Yellowtail roll ($9) - \"really yummy\" Sesame Ginger chicken Taco (2 for $7) - \"so so. Not very flavorful\"  Spicy Tuna Tacos (3 for $12) - \"tasty but very messy to eat in the hard shell\"  And the table shared two desserts  One was like a chocolate cake with a black currant sesame ice cream.  This one was pretty good. ($8). The cake was dense. It usually comes with a salted caramel ice cream but they ran out.   Tres Leches cake ($8). If you are expecting tres Leches cake like your nana made this is NOT it. This cake is much denser than a normal tres Leches dessert. It comes sitting in some sort of sweet condensed milk sauce that is fantastic!  Only wish would be that the sauce was a little thicker. I think if the cake was served a bit warmer it would be a knock out of the park.   After all is said and done we spend $136 (including 3 beers).   FINAL THOUGHTS:  the food is good. They've got some tasty combinations on the menu. Don't come here with picky eaters because they really have no options for them. Be prepared to spend some cash and expect smaller portions than you're probably used to. Reservations are recommended after 7pm. For better pricing go for happy hour between 4 and 6pm but it's only at the sushi bar, the bar, or the patio high tops.   And just so you all know - we walked out of the doors at 7:15pm and there were still 5-7 empty tables.",

The Mexican/Asian Fusion approach really works with the different sweet fruit flavors, cilantro/sriracha and marinated meats (El Pastor) they blend together...  The service, atmosphere and drinks ($15 bottomless Mamosas/Bloodies) are top notch here.  Might be my favorite restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale now.  If you have a baby, be prepared to deal with no changing rooms in the bathrooms though.  Make sure to call in your reservation.",

    "text": "I heard so much about this place, and I've been wanted to try...   Food: it is tapas style, or in Japanese izakaya style.  Each portion is small so it will be good if you order about two dishes per person to share with the group.  Everything we ordered was very good, great flavor, nicely presented. Looked yummy and tasted yummy too.  Dates wrapped in bacon: I like the sauce on the dish. Dates and bacon are interesting mix but this sauce nicely mixed together.  Suzuki roll: I liked the smell and taste of slightly deep fried? rice around the roll. Maya roll: Double spicy (spicy tuna and spicy sauce (I think it was wasabi base sauce).  Nonetheless, liked the flavor. Kimuchi fried rice: tasted better than the one I make at home. Smelled the kimuchi but it wasn't overwhelming at all.   Sometimes kimuchi could be strong, but I think the sauce on the dish toned it down to the level the kimuchi was enjoyable. Chinese Chicken salad: nothing fancy... We shared three deserts and all were good.   This place said Mexican Asian fusion but the way they used difference sauce reminded me of French food.  I think they used French dressing for Chinese Chicken salad Nice decor inside, mix of Mexican and Asian. I didn't necessarily loved it but it was certainly interesting for sure.  Service: although it was good but very slow... We were there for lunch and ended up being there for two hours. So if you are in a rush, this place is not good for you. Go there only if you want to enjoy the fun atmosphere with a group of friends to enjoy conversation.  Food was so interesting, I want to come back and try all the rest when I have more time. I like French, Mexican and Asian in general. When combined, it is perfect of all.",

My parents and I went to SumoMaya after hiking up Tom's Thumb Trail. We made it in time for the happy hour and it was delicious. We were a under dressed for the occasion, wearing only the clothes that we used to hike up a mountain. The employees didn't bat an eye, thank god! First we ordered bacon guacamole, which I must say was the best guac I've ever eaten. We went ahead and ordered three servings of SumoMaya's happy hour tacos. First came the Sesame Ginger Tacos. The good news, they were fantastic! The better news, it was only getting better! They brought out the Korean Beef Taco and Pork \"Al Pastor\" Tacos at the same time. Both of them, especially the Pork \"Al Pastor\" Tacos were the best tacos i've ever eaten.  I highly recommend this establishment. You won't be disappointed. You might even see me, as I will for sure be coming back!   Btw, it is also a great place to watch football as they have 4 HUGE TV's over the bar.   PSS, amazing margaritas!",

    "text": "Needy, greedy, and rude.  Needy and greedy happened before we even got into the restaurant.  The entire parking lot was empty, but coned off for valet.  Not a valet was in sight so we went ahead and parked.  It was like someone said Beetlejuice three times because as soon as we locked the car, a valet magically appeared and demanded the keys because this section - the entire parking lot - was valet only - needy and greedy.  We went into the restaurant, and the hostess told us only the bar seating was open.  We went to the bar area, and all the tables were full, and we didn't want to sit right at the bar.  As we started to head for the door someone walked by and said we could have one of the dinner tables if we wanted, but that section was closed so we told him we would just come back some other time.  At this point everything was still fine.  As we were walking out, we heard the hostess make a disparaging comment about us.  I called the restaurant's manager from the car, and he half heartedly said sorry, but he didn't hear the comment.  Note to manager:  your employees don't act rude and make nasty comments when you're standing there.  Very. Rude.  I don't care how good the food is at this restaurant and I certainly wouldn't know after this experience.  I live in Scottsdale, and there are many excellent restaurants throughout the city.  I will spend my dollars elsewhere.  I don't see this restaurant being a player for long with such a rude, coarse staff.",

    "text": "Just got back from an early Friday night drinks and dinner at SumoMaya.  Arrived at 7ish and left at 9:30.  There were four of us.    The good:  The food was great!  Drinks were creative and tasty.  Korean tacos amazing and sushi rolls fabulous.   Service was outstanding.  Decor was cool.  Tree in the middle of the restaurant was inventive and fun!  Had a reservation so no waiting.  Music was hip and loud and made for a dynamic atmosphere.    The bad:  It is a Scottsdale cliche with a high \"ick\" factor.  Husband saw a steroid dude and duck lipped woman leave the men's bathroom stall together at 8:15pm, we had wine spilled on us while we were seated at our table because of an almost bar fight between drunk 50 year olds, and had a front row seat for what looked like a dating scene nightmare.  Kid you not, Godzilla was playing on the big screen over the bar as if to drive home the point.  Felt like I was in a cartoon version of Jersey Shore meets Real Housewives of OC.   If this sounds like your thing, this is your place!",

From the moment you walk in the door you will notice a huge tree in the center of the dining area. Their bar is large and has tvs surrounding it. On this particular night, there was a DJ who played fun and lively music that had music videos on the tv screens. Their Mexican-Japanese fusion food has never disappointed me. I've enjoyed their pork belly raman, street tacos and sushi. This menu doesn't have a single item on it that doesn't sound appetizing. The staff has always been very knowledgeable of food items, which has been helpful for avoiding food allergies. Any chance that I get I am recommending this restaurant to family, friends, and clients.",

If they would just turn their focus squarely on saying YES to the first question and a hearty NO to the next two questions, this could be a great restaurant.  We were there for dinner and tried a mixture of dishes: starting from the bacon-laced guacamole through to the pork pad thai, the food was flavored just right and unlike anything I've tried at either an \"mexican\" or \"asian\" restaurant.  The kitchen really delivered on the brand promise / vision for this restaurant.  On the strictly food scale, this place rocks a 5.  It's just too bad that, aside from the stunning decor and great physical environment, they have chosen to ruin the atmosphere with Miami Beach club music overpowering the entire scene and with a waitstaff that would probably not make the grade at your local McDonalds.  We won't be returning any time soon as these two elements really turned a great food experience into a sour dining experience.",

The chips and pomegranate guac were awesome.  For dinner, I ordered the chopped salad and it was much larger than I expected with tons of veggies and super flavorful. I asked the waiter if they had another dressing option, like balsamic vinegar or anything else and he said no, which was surprising since their other salads had different dressing options? So instead I used some the soy sauce on the table and it was a-ok. My husband got the ceasar salad, which was also generously sized and very tasty.  Everyone in our party was happy with their meals and and then the desserts...wow, everything was so yum! Glad we had the opportunity to give it another try and will certainly be back.  **fyi- it is a bit loud and difficult to carry conversations across the table***",

When you share that with 3 people, the chips were gone within minutes. Asked for more and we got 3 more, but were also charged for the extra chips. I ordered the Kimchee Fried Rice with a regular iced tea, it was ok. The rice tasted horribly burnt, which ruined the meal. All I could taste was a burnt taste.  Again, for lunch and separate bills I will never understand why my bill for my portion was $25. It was only for my lunch. My friend had the tacos, the size of the tacos were laughable. Within 3 hours of having ate there, we were hungry. Not a filling place. But it looks like it would be fun for drinks. Needs work on the food.",

Unlimited food and drinks is $40 total which is worth it, it includes unlimited appetizers, sides and dessert (which is delicious, the cheesecake is to die for) and on top of that an entree all of your own. The mimosas are good but you can also get beer, bloody Mary's or margaritas, the best part is they aren't skimpy on alcohol like you would think since it's unlimited.

We were really excited for it. See pic for idea of costs and charge for ice.  I wouldn't recommend this place for seniors who aren't open minded with food. It was difficult for them to find something. The margaritas are rockin.  We had jack on rocks and surprised to find out they charge $2 for (rocks) which was plain old ice. That was a bummer.",

They drown it in a sauce so it's not like crunchy, but I did like the overall taste and would definitely recommend getting it. The pork belly sushi was alright. Pork belly isn't the most flavorful meat out there, so it did taste a little flat, but still good quality. The green tea soba noodles were my favorite! Definitely recommend. Had a nice light, fresh flavor and honestly could've just ate it myself LOL.  Came at a rather popular time and there was no wait!",

I'm pretty sure one was my grandma. It's a little loud with a Dj, and full of beautiful people. You may want to dress up a smidge. Even this yoga pants devotee put on heels and a dress for this place. My friends took me here and it was lovely.   Now the food:  The street corn was topped with popcorn. It was unexpected but delicious. It added additional texture.   The chocolate peanut butter dessert was how I like my men: rich and sweet. It was almost like fudge. So if fudge and ice cream does not appeal to you, don't get it. It was smooth, sweet, and nutty. I'd definitely get it again, and I'd probably skip eating a big dinner so I could eat it myself.   The sushi rolls that I can't remember the names were good. It wasn't amazing, but it was good. Definitely better than the average sushi offerings for a desert.   The lobster ceviche was fantastic. It was topped with avocado, full of bright, fresh flavors. It was served with baked corn tortillas. If I get that again, I'm not sharing. I loved it.   Definitely come here.",

    "text": "So had to up date my review and down grade to two stars.  Its been quite a while since I've been here and I couldn't remember why,  then once I sat down it all came back.     To start I made the unfortunate choice of getting a table.  Although only 10 feet from the bar and high top tables,  by some strange mystery happy hour doesn't apply.  Higher overhead costs I assume.  When I asked the server why,  she said she didn't know that's just the way the owner wanted it.  So it literally would have saved me 50% on drinks and appetizers just to order them from the bar and bring them back to my table. We just decided to order neither.  If the restaurant wants to make it difficult to enjoy happy hour then no reason to come early... or maybe at all.   Not much else has changed.  The place and employees continually remind you how cool they are and how lucky toy are to be here.  I give up cool a long time ago,  so maybe spend money where cool is not required.   In fairness,  here was my prior review: Really a 3 1/2 stars, a little above average. Great ideas, good sushi, but trying a little too hard to be different. Food is fresh and tastes good. But there are a lot of restaurants in Scottsdale that have the same. It is very popular. My wife would probably rate higher.",

Although a sushi traditionalist would be horrified, the goofy combinations actually worked very well. The standout dish was the hamachi ceviche. Slightly sweet with a citrus ponzu sauce, caviar saltiness brought it to an exquisite balance. Pad Thai was less successful, but still decent. Didn't have a bad dish.

The sushi is great as well. Johnathon is an amazing bar tender as well if you go by yourself and want some great conversation.",

She answered all of our questions, and showed us (and explained) the dinner menu, so we understood the Asian/mex fusion, and so would come back for more.   Food was great- we ordered gauc, chicken, fish, and mushroom tacos, edamame, calamari, tuna roll--and everything tasted fresh and was presented well.   We will definitely be back for dinner. The decor and atmosphere reminds me of a a lot of the restaurants I went to in England and Europe when I lived there, so it was a refreshing surprise when we walked in to see something designed so well.  I look forward to tasting their dinners!",

SumoMaya manages to do both, impressively, I might add.  Add to the mix that the ingredients that they use are obviously selected with care and are of excellent quality.  Presentation is really well done also.  We liked it so much we went 2 days in a row for lunch.  Both times service was good and food was exceptional.  We tried a bunch of different things - some specialty rolls, guacamole with pomegranate, Korean bbq tacos... everything was at least good and most were excellent.  The menu is fun and interesting.  I wanted to try it all.  It isn't cheap but it is well worth it.  I don't know that I would enjoy it for dinner because I can see it probably being crowded and loud.  I'm old :)   But for lunch it was excellent and will be my first choice any time I am in the area.",

Food was delicious and they pulled off the Mexican-Japanese fusion well. The only bump was the crab chili ramen, which was a one note affair tasting of ramen, Siracha and that overpowered the crab. More veggies, scallions, ginger, onions would have rounded it out into a multilayered taste. The Mexican corn was removed from the cob, a nice step making eating easier, but the plain popcorn garnish was cute but would have benefited from a complimentary taste such as cayenne powder, cheese, etc. The tempura rock shrimp was tasty, as were the bacon wrapped dates in going gras sauce. The pork pad Thai was great. Overall a neat experience.",

Through reading the reviews, we expected the restaurant to be really loud; it was not at all. Yes, the music was at a higher volume than most restaurants, but it honestly helped to create the vibe of the place! We started with the guacamole, continued with the chicken tinga tacos, and ended the night with 2 sushi rolls (the salmon avocado and the Suzuki roll). Both full of flavors of Asian and Mexican cuisine. If you're looking for a fun place (reasonably priced) and a great place to people watch, go to Sumo Maya!! We will be back for sure.",

We quickly found out that happy hour is only served at the bar or high top tables, and if we couldn't find a spot we would have to be seated at a regular table and be served from the dinner menu.   We walked around a bit and noticed almost all the happy hour designated areas were full, with the exception of the sushi bar. Feeling unsure if the sushi bar was really a happy hour spot, we stood around until one of the hostesses came by and asked to seat us again. She seemed rather inconvenienced for having to speak to us despite the fact that the restaurant was 75% empty.   We said we would be seated and she grabbed some menus and sat us outside on the patio, even though it was really hot and the inside had many open tables.   At this point we were both feeling unwelcome and uncomfortable, and we took a look at the menu. Though our server seemed to be a little friendlier, we were no longer excited to try the food, nor were we hungry. We didn't want to dine in a place that felt a bit too pretentious. We decided to leave before ordering anything.   Although the restaurant had a unique vibe and decor and we heard the food was good, we left feeling that it's not our scene, a bit too posh and trendy for a relaxed happy hour to kickoff the weekend. I'm sure it's a great fit for others, but I won't be trying it again.   Also the only parking available is complimentary valet, which is never really \"complimentary.\"",

    "text": "I don't normally do this, in fact I've never done this but I'm that dissatisfied that I'm going there.  I enjoy going out and trying new restaurants.. who doesn't? SumoMaya in Scottsdale I had been to one other time besides this evening. The first time I thought things were a bit over priced and it was over all too loud to even enjoy the company you were with (If with a large group). Tonight I went back with only 1 other friend. I ate specifically before hand so that I could just enjoy the drinks and evening but not spend an arm and leg.   So my reasoning behind this post is I am extremely upset at the lack of customer service received. Being charged almost $20 per glass of wine I almost crapped my pants. I have never and would NEVER spend that much per glass. I am upset and dissatisfied because I had actually POINTED to the glass originally wanted, when receiving my bill and noticing the charge I let the waiter know what was wrong.  The waiter spoke to the bartender and I was told that since the glasses were already drank, there was nothing they could do. I was ALSO told that maybe if there was a miscommunication it could of been fixed. I'm sorry, but when I physically point out what I want and you bring me the most expensive kind you have..... how is that my fault?!!! Needless to say I will not be going back, their need to fix any unhappy customers and their wrong doings is zero to none. With the amount of money they pull in on a daily basis... my two glasses knocked down to the price I had thought, wouldn't even be a dent to them. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a good time, able to hear your company and not charged for the most expensive thing on the menu.  $50 for the glass of wine and edamame...... what a joke. I have never been so mad at a place I've been to for the lack of trying to fix a mistake!!!!",

I thought Asian-Mexican was going to be crazy---and it is---crazy GOOD!  We started with a first course: I had the tea-smoked duck with this spicy blackberry chutney.  Duck cooked perfectly, and the chutney. Oh!  DH started scraping it off my plate and eating it with a spoon.  He had little sushi rolls topped with tender, mojo marinated shrimp---yum!  Then we split a house salad---not on the RW menu, but we were hungry.  Crisp, fresh, fab soy-ginger dressing.  Next our entrees arrived.  DH got the Achiote Chicken, which was quite good---very tender and flavorful.  But my dish was the best, and DH said that he would order our next visit: the Pork al Pastor Pad Thai.  To. Die. For.  It was just to good to explain.  Desert was this insane Tres Leches cake topped with a crown of toasted meringue.  The meringue and the cake were so-so-sweet, but then there was a layer of this incredibly tangy citrus--lime?  It was so tart it took your breath away, and combined with the sweet---bliss.  Our server was Nicole and she was PERFECT!  Noise level unbelievable between disc jockey and tipsy Happy Hour crowd---when we definitely return, it will probably be for lunch when the noise level might be more bearable.  But the whole experience so good, we'd come for dinner and wear earplugs!",

    "text": "I have to start this in saying I generally am rather picky.  It's not that I don't like new things, but I generally gravitate in a specific comfort zone and go from there.  My mother and sister had been here once before, and felt it was a place I would love.  So, for a birthday celebration I found myself there.  Let me tell you a little bit about my experience and the case of the vanishing dishes.  Immediately, I blown away by the decor.  The place is clearly modeled in a modern fashion and is very eye catching.  Easy to navigate, and with a great view of both the sushi station and the kitchen itself, you can literally see everything going on.  When we first sat down, we were pleasantly greeted, and were explained in great detail the cocktail menu and the tastes as well.  From there, we the took a gander at the menu and this is where the real excitement began.  While I have had Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese before I have never quite had anything like what SumoMaya offers.   We immediately started off with sushi.  Being that I have had sushi before and watched \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" I considered myself to be an expert on the raw fishy product.  Ok, I'm not, but I didn't need to be to say that the Spicy Crab we had was absolutely delightful.  A great splash of spice with a hint of lemon to help balance, myself and my family immediately devoured it.  From there, we then ordered the Tempura Cod and Korean tacos.  Those found themselves immediately devoured as well, and in this case even quicker than we could truly appreciate the fantastic presentation.  So far, SumoMaya had been blowing us away in food and after sipping on the four different cocktails we had ordered based upon the waitress's suggestion we were certainly on cloud nine.  Then, came Mexican Pho.  I must confess that my first trying of Pho came from an ex, and I was an addict after my first try.  So, after seeing this I just had to get it.  The waitress was polite to let us know that it was far from a normal Pho, and she certainly was right.  However, right in the best possible way.  This was like a chili meets a splash of Pho.  We immediately devoured it as the Pad Thai came out, only for that to mysterious vanish immediately.  Food seems to not stick around for long when it comes to SumoMaya.  Fusion cuisine can be a bit of a skeptical situation, and I've seen recent reviews not care for this place but to be honest I can't see why.  We had a variety of food covering several aspects of the menu, including dessert, and found that the consistency was spot on for every dish.  The cocktails were unique and creative, the menu was diverse and each dish was incredibly well prepared and enjoyed by the entire family.  Further, the pricing was more than fair for the quality.   The only real complain I could offer is that the service was a bit slow, but for them wishing me Happy Birthday after my sister informed them and doing so not with a song, not with a giant commotion, but very polite manners and a simple candle left me thinking, \"A bit of a longer wait is alright by me\".  I think I'll find myself driving up from Tucson just to go here every now and again.",

    "text": "this is a review for weekend brunch. a much more civilized endeavor compared to what transpires after dark at SuMa (and that's WITH the bottomless mimosas).  So the bloody mary mix is top notch. but I tend to go with the bottomless mimosas because there are multiple flavors and you can mix and match to your hearts content (pineapple and blood orange are my top 2).  as for the rolls, the Salmon Apple is my favorite. off the desayuno side, the huevos divorciados, and for something unique, get their twist on Pho.  and i love how they have huge screens with football on but it's somehow just in the background and not the centerpiece of the floor plan. which is nice because you can glace over and see how your fantasy season is rapidly imploding along with your RB1s knees but it won't be rubbed in your face. This lets you get back to celebrating the awesomeness that is SuMa with your bottomless beverage in hand.  PS: If you could give six stars for service, they would have it.",

    "text": "I am editing my initial review and adding a star.  The reason being I think I posted my first draft in a \"Scottsdale Douchey\" tone that is not my style.   Also I think I neglected to point out the highlights.    But also have you ever seen a movie that you didn't think much of when you left the theatre but a week later realized it was better than you thought.    So here's the good:  Mojito thing was crazy good.  Mushroom tacos where amazing.  Service was excellent.  The mango habanero sauce they leave on tables I practically drank (should bottle that stuff up).   The bad:  I was disappointed in the guacamole but now I realize it was just guacamole. I mean how good or different could it be.  Also the mole wasn't as saucy as I'd like and the plantains were indistinguishable from the chicken which was dry.   The ugly:   The tres leche dessert was a disaster.  Not a good note to finish on. I've heard others claim it was great so maybe we had an off batch.    The decor is great though acoustics are bad but that wasn't a bad thing as it gave the space energy.    We also ordered sushi and I think it was pricey for what it was and while it wasn't bad, it also didn't blow mind.   I think for sure we need to go back and explore other options on the menu.    Perhaps the most constructive critique I could give would be to simplify the menu and offer fewer choices, but put more heart and soul into every item",

The server was knowledgeable and served us our food in a timely manner to where it was not overwhelming. His suggestions were thoughtful and he communicated well.   So the food... Was great, the plates are beautiful and balanced. I started with the hamachi ceviche and the truffle oil shined through without ruining the taste of the fish. The sushi rolls were also great and all of it was just great.   The dessert and coffee were amazing! We had the tres leches cake and I had a cup of coffee to go with it.

So on the way to the restaurant we looked at the menu and made fun of it on the way there -- Mexican-Asian combination? My wife made fun in the car about \"Mexican sushi...?\"  Well, we couldn't be so wrong and ate our hats as we walked into the restaurant. Modern design, high ceiling and perfect lighting leading to most positive atmosphere. And the service -- most pleasant!   We were with our three kids (12, 14 and 17) and felt somewhat out of place with them given this very unique restaurant, but our waiter Frank was amazing. He never let us feel unusual and was great with the kids .   We just finished a 2.5-weeks RV trip and this was an amazing treat for all of us. Food was truly amazing. The combination of flavors was most unique and unusually good! Words cannot describe the unique flavor combination and how much we enjoyed dinner. Just to explain how much we enjoyed the restaurant, it would be sufficient to say that our 17 y.o. daughter asked us to fly her from the east coast to eat here again on her b-day! This is how much we all enjoyed it.  On a personal level -- it would be very difficult for me to eat sushi in a long while since I thought that they had the best sushi I ever ate anywhere!  If you are in the Phoenix are and love to eat I think that this is a must visit restaurant!",

We arrived right at 7 without reservations, but we were able to sit at the counter next to the kitchen with no waiting. The restaurant staff was very busy when we arrived, and although it took a few moments for our server to get to us, he let us know he saw us and that he would be on his way soon. As busy as he was, he was super chill when interacting with us. Our server gave us some excellent suggestions - we always like to hear if the staff has any favorite recommendations. The chef gave us a complimentary salad while we waited for our food - what a fantastic gesture! It was delicious! We really enjoyed watching the kitchen staff operate. The kitchen was running efficiently and the staff was very professional. We ordered the miso soup, kimchi fried rice, a red dragon roll, and the apple salmon roll. The food was excellent - all of it. It tasted freshly made, it was beautifully prepared and visually appealing, the hot food was hot, and the rolls were perfect. Our service was top notch. Every staff member was very courteous and everyone seemed to love their job. The restaurant is beautiful, and I enjoyed the overall ambience, though I have to agree with another previous review in that it was quite noisy. I am self admittedly over-sensitive to noise in a restaurant, so no surprise there. Based on my first and only experience at SumoMaya, I would highly recommend it! I think our server's name was Mike, but I can't recall for certain.",

    "text": "I used to go here all the time but haven't for a few months. I went in for Sunday brunch and they offered a $29 pp shared apps and entree or an a la carte menu and advertised $10 pp bottomless mimosas, margaritas, and Micheladas. I asked the bartender if I could order just an entree since I wasn't interested in the apps or desert with the mimosas and was told yes. My husband ordered the bottomless option and drank one drink and then ordered a margarita for his second drink. When I ordered a second drink, I was told that since I didn't do the $29 breakfast, I could not have the $10 drink special. When the check came I was charged $10 for an awful mimosa and my husband was charged for a Michelada and $13 for a Patron margarita (he ordered the house). I told the manager that we were told we could order the special with an entree but she didn't care and that was it. Our 3 drinks were 50% of the bill. We would have nevered ordered any if we weren't told we could get the $10'special. The only reason I give it 1 star is that the food was pretty good. The customer service is awful and we will never be back.",

Tap water there is terrible but is kind of necessary when drinking cocktails. Bring a water bottle.",

After 25 minutes we had to ask a random server to send someone to take our drink order. The server came right over and did so. We ordered our food as well. Our child's meal came out quickly but he was almost finished by the time any of our food arrived. We had to ask a second time for them to deliver our son's drink and which he ordered along with ours. Two sushi rolls of ours trickled out of the kitchen and we finished them long before our third plate arrived. When the third plate came the food runner pushed it into the corner of our table and left the empty sushi plates behind.  We had to ask for them to be cleared. We were done with our third plate and waited about 15 minutes. Two sides never arrived. We asked the server to cancel them. One was still brought to the table and we sent it back. We had to ask for the dessert included in the kids meal to be brought to the table. The single piece of Mochi took another 10 minutes. We got the check and waited 15 minutes for it to be picked up. Literally couldn't wait to get out of there and felt sorry for the people lined up at the door. Also the manager was speaking to the table next to us apologizing for messing up their order. So it wasn't just us. And the icing on the cake is that both our table and the table next to us were told what time we had to leave by Bc the table had another reservation! We would've left an hour earlier if they could learn proper service. Thumbs down.",

Props to everyone being attentive and gracious with the food suggestions. drinks: 5 stars-I had a Tokyo mule, 'nuff said.   We ordered, and it's recommended, you share a variety of plates.  It's tapas/family style so, you'll want to order a variety of things to sample.  Our list:  LUMP CRAB GUACAMOLE-fresh, seasoned well, and served with fried tortillas-YUMM.  CHICHARRON DE POLLO-imagine spicy chicken tenders, but better. YUP. KIMCHEE FRIED RICE-eggs, mushroom, and a kick. Paired well with beef. YES ROLLO CHINGON-adobo, jalapeno, and a strawberry glaze.  Top seller, and pretty good. YUP. VIETNAMESE STYLE \"SHAKING BEEF\"-filet mignon with an amazing serrano chile sauce-YES.

Nothing wrong with that. Everyone was very well dressed and looking spiffy. We got and shared several sushi dishes, street tacos and some appetizers. I was expecting upscale Cali style dining but nothing was good, really. The tacos were little soggy circles of blandness. The shishito peppers were okay. My Japanese friend states the sushi was not worthy of being served. This is not a picky person, mind you. The mimosas were fine, we also tried a Sonoran Sunrise which was all alcohol. Which I drank, of course. Really cool place with a huge tree in the middle. Decor very upscale, they just need to work on the food.",

Thus, you can go many different routes- big feasts, nibbles+drank, sushi night, on and on and on  2) Shut up and get these things: Chile Crab Garlic Noodles. And the Pork Belly (or is it Bacon or is it Chicaron ?) guac.   3) cool pop art feel. lots of bright colors. Warholian screen print-ish images. and a bright blue tree right in the center of the restaurant. it fascinates me every time and I am going to steal that idea and get a blue tree in my house (when i own a home)  4) the service is top notch.

The guy at the table stood up and physically threatened us and wanted to fight. It was awful.  We tired to defuse the situation however; he was very aggressive towards us and wanted to fight. We called over the manager, Cecilia, who was worthless!  She simply moved the other party and never even apologized to us for what happen. On the contrary, she made us out to be the bad guy. When we tried to talk to talk with her about what happened after the fact, she just blew us off. I know we are only four people but we will never dine her again. I strongly recommend that the look at other options when considering this establishment if your personal safety is important to you.",

My only complaint would be that the lobster dynamite was supposed to be in a light aioli but it was more of a heavy sauce that totally masked the taste of the lobster, shrimp, and crab.  The Mexican street corn had a great flavor and the presentation was one of a kind that included some popcorn.  I will come back again when in town in the future.",

While the food is pretty good and the atmosphere is very nice, the prices are a little above average (for Scottsdale at least) and the portions are about half of what they should be AT BEST!  I don't have too big of a stomach (for a heavier guy) but my whole group left this place feeling like we barely at anything.  I can only assume that the atmosphere is what keeps this place busy.  I suggest going to this place for apps & drinks or you better plan on ordering 2 meals!!!",

I would have it with every meal if I could. The atmosphere of this place is great - there's a freaking tree in the middle of the restaurant, a fantastic bar, and amazing patio seating. I love the mis-matched chairs and plate settings (I always try to sit in the gold throne).   If you need a new brunch spot, this is it. Don't miss the guac, sushi, or tacos, or eggs benny. Honestly everything here is good. 11/10 recommend. I would get married here like I love it so much",

Rainbow ceviche was delicious and the rock shrimp roll was to die for... plantains, bacon wrapped dates... everything was superb!!  Would definitely come back.  Great place to eat.

Also the place has lost its surprise element as the food is getting repetitive and I wish they added some seasonal offerings to keep the regular people coming back for more.   New discoveries that I loved : the green curry rice was amazing. Nicely presented as well as flavourful.    Complete let downs: The crispy chicken mole was too dry and tough not sure if it was a mistake on the day I tried it but won't be venturing this direction. The Red Dragon Roll came with way too much sauce. I couldn't even taste the eel or tuna. The Apple- salmon roll was Ok but I am sure they can do better.   I have loved so much of their food that I am almost sad that I had to come back and remove a star and edit the review. And this the first time I have done this esp. in case of a restaurant I have loved to visit often. Won't be coming here soon.",

    "text": "It was a birthday dinner for my youngest who turned 22.  As a party of seven, we made reservations early.  This was my first time, although I've always wanted to try SumoMaya to see what it is like.  I'm happy to say, I came away quite pleased.  We arrived on time for our dinner and we were seated quickly.  With 7 of us, we had trouble deciding what to drink or eat, but Candace, our server, took it in stride and gave us our space.  The dining room is large and open, and a bit noisy, so for a hearing-impaired person, expect difficulty conversing.   Eventually we got around to ordering drinks and appetizers.  I had the \"Perfect\" margarita, and yes, it was perfect.  For apps, we had Shishito peppers, Mexican Street Corn, Pomegranate Guacamole and the girls all had some variation of sashimi.  ALL of these were excellent and the only complaint was with the crispy tortilla shells that were delivered.  They were kinda stingy with these, despite us having two appetizers that needed them.  The street corn was a bit unusual in flavor, but not bad, and presentation of everything was exceptional.  We had a mix of vegetarians and meat-eaters at the table, and Candace's recommendation was that we order two or more entrees each and pass them around.  Yeah, but at $29, $32 with noodles added for the VN Shaking Beef, I am wont to share.  The wife had Chilled Green Tea Soba noodles, and while she said it was good, she also said she would not order it again.  FSIL had the Pork \"Al Pastor\" Pad Thai, and while it was shy on pork, it was a tasty dish. Other dishes were the Seafood Fried Rice, and Kimchee Fried Rice, both of which were enjoyed.  Apparently there was an issue with the Seafood Fried Rice, which is described as a \"Paella\" type dish, and it included Chicken, which was not mentioned on the menu.  The vegetarian diner pointed this out and the dish was quickly replaced, sans chicken.  when I mentioned it was a birthday dinner, Candace was ready with a birthday dessert, and told me that since there was an issue with the Paella, they would be comping two desserts.    Dinner was excellent, and made more so by the most excellent service from Candace, she was available when we needed her, but hands-off otherwise, which suited us perfectly.  A huge thanks to Candace for making this dinner exceptional.  Would I go back?  Most Definitely.",

When we wanted to order food after waiting another 15 minutes we had to have another server go get her and when she came over no apology.  So we then proceeded to order and the first round of food came and it took awhile again and looked as though it had been sitting under the heat lamp for a bit and I even commented that because our bacon wrap dates were burnt and the waitress had the nerve to get snippy with me.  Then we had to flag her down again to get our check and I had ordered a glass of wine 15 minutes prior which had been sitting at the bar for about 10 minutes and she then proceeded to bring it after our check.  I want to like this spot and the food is great but this is the second time I've gotten bad service.",

However, it doesn't make for a great dining experience. There were five of us. I got my meal first. it was about another 10 minutes until the next person got their meal. Then by the end, we had all finished our meals and the last person at the table hadn't gotten his tuna tacos. We also ordered fried rice with shrimp since the meals are ala carte. We were ready to leave and they still hadn't brought the rice, so we canceled the order. The waitress was nice. The manager came by and listened to our complaints.  All in all, a very mixed dining experience. And not cheap, particularly for the small portions.",

    "text": "My husband and I had a great experience here. This is a big, open, loud place with a feeling of a lot of activity. There is a large bar in the center with projector televisions, and even the inside area has an outdoors feel. Not the place to go for a quiet, intimate dinner. The waitress told us there were four kitchens, so everything you order comes out at different times. We had a great server who seemed to have absolute perfect timing - was always there when we wanted something without being overbearing. The food is served tapas style, but the portions of most of what we ordered were actually pretty large and we ended up ordering more food than we needed. We got the edamame, the pomegranite guac, pork pad thai, and korean beef tacos. Everything was amazing. The drinks were also fantastic. I expected to like the place based on what I had heard, but it exceeded my expectations.",

My only complaint about the food was the egg in the ramen was less cooked than I prefer, with quite a bit of the white uncooked, but still edible. I am visiting Phoenix for the second time and Josh, who was our waiter was hands down the best server I have had in this town. I was however a bit disappointed in the atmosphere.  It felt more like a loud club than a restaurant. If you want to chat with someone across the table, or your server for that matter, get ready to yell because this place is loud (all of the servers were squatting at tables taking orders and such).  They did slightly turned down the volume after asking twice, but it would slowly move back up. Our server politely explained that the restaurant management makes a conscious decision to feel more club like and he was sorry if we weren't happy with the volume, he would pass our complaints on.  I was not surprised that our request to lower the volume did little to change the volume because there was a DJ at the hostess desk. I would eat here for lunch because the food and service were great, but will avoid dinner hours in the future (our reservation was 6:30 PM on a Saturday).",

Tonight however for the first time I walked out of a restaurant. After no one, but the person who poured out water (his name was Seth and he was so nice!), came to our table for 15 minutes we left. The table right next to us was being waited on and despite being walked by at least 8 times total by 3 different people not one person acknowledged our table. Best part was on the way out the hostess who greeted us asked how the food was....because 15 minutes is the usual table turnover time. Really upset about this one and honestly unless they fix their wait staff problems I don't think I will comeback or recommend them :(",

Our server gave us great recommendations, the pineapple pisco was a great cocktail, and the bacon wrapped dates and Korean bbq taco are a must try. I can't wait to try the ceviches and the guacamole.  Our server, Benjamin, was wonderful.  Asian Mexican fusion, in both flavor and ambiance, at its finest.",

After my fiance asked if it was cheaper to order mimosas individually if she was only going to have two versus the bottomless mimosas for $15, I was charged $18 for two. When I asked the waiter if he could change it to the $15 price (since bottomless was only $15 and two was supposed to be cheaper than that) he replied that this was how his manager told him to charge me. So if you are having thoughts on having two mimosas, that is more than bottomless!",

    "text": "Where do I even begin! When I first heard of a Mexican Asian restaurant opening up, I had no idea what to expect but I figured that since I like both cuisines, I would probably enjoy it. I was right. They did a great job fusing the cuisines. In fact, what took the relationship so long to bloom!?   Ambiance:  Looks are deceiving and the exterior of this place looks nothing like the interior. From the outside, you'd think it just looks like any other generic restaurant, but don't be deceived. Step through the doors and you immediately enter this open, airy and trendy restaurant that even has a real tree hanging out in the middle of the restaurant...yes a tree! I especially found the pictures of random people on the chairs pretty entertaining. The restaurant itself has a combination of a wrap around bar and then dining area. Make a reservation to be on the safe side! This is great spot for a night out with friends, a double date or event a spot to get a couple cocktails and apps!   Food & Drinks:   Now, moving on to the most important part, food and drinks! First, the drinks. I enjoyed the Passion Fruit sangria and boy does that pack a punch! I expected it to be sweet, but instead it was pretty potent...in a good way! Next, the food. This restaurant is all about sharing the plates and it's nice because that means you can try much more! Everything on the menu looked delicious, so our group of four ordered it all!   Guacamole - they serve up some of the most unique guacamole choices I've ever seen! We decided to order the Lump Crab Guacamole. I'm ruined because I don't think I will ever be able to enjoy \"regular\" guacamole again. It was the perfect amount of crab and the key lime added a tasty twist. The only downfall was that it only came with four tortilla chips and if you wanted to order more, it was $1 more per order of chips. The guacamole is already $14, so with the additional chips, it made for a pricey appetizer!   Rock Shrimp Tempura - I'm such a fan of rock shrimp and especially when it has some Asian flavoring to it. This dish was anything but disappointing and I could have gobbled this dish up all by myself! The rock shrimp tempura comes with a variety of veggies including tomatoes and green beans. The summer mayo had the perfect flavorful kick to it. I want my own order next time!  Rollo Chingon Sushi Roll (cooked) - This roll comes with grilled shrimp, guacamole, jalapeno and has a balsamic strawberry glaze. See where they do a good job fusing the two cuisines? I had no idea I was eating a Mexican food sushi roll because it tasted delicious! It came with eight bites and was great for sharing.  Suzuki Roll - This roll was another great Mexican Asian combo with spicy tuna, avocado, and then a chipotle aioli! They have eight bites in a roll so this was another good one to share and very flavorful.   Summer Corn - order this! I loved it and could have eaten it all on my own. The spiced popcorn on top of the corn created an interesting yet flavorful kick to it!   Bacon Wrapped Dates - an order comes with six, so there's plenty to share however you will want more than one! These little guys are so good! The combination of salty bacon and sweet date compliments each other perfectly.  Half Lobster _ Crab Dynamite - order this but be warned, you won't want to share! This was the best thing I ate on the menu!   After my experience, I would say that my top three favorite things I ate were the rock shrimp, corn and lobster/crab. I would order the three items next time but I would probably order the lobster as my own entree next time. It's that good!",

The synthetic tree in the middle of the dining room (you'd never know it isn't real) just makes it along with the $1mln bar.   The food is generally fantastic with a few items that are \"only\" very good and therefore just a couple of ticks below life changing. I'd strongly recommend the Miso glazed sea bass, the Pork Pad Thai and the Guacamole with crab.   The service has always been excellent.  Value for the money is pretty stellar. Most menu items are under $20.   The only thing I would change is how loud the dining room is. I love background music and high energy music in a social setting is cool too, but not so loud that I can't have a conversation.   Bonus points to the ever-present McLarens, Ferraris, Aston Martins and Porsches parked out front. It's pure entertainment watching Scottsdale millionaires pull up in their Beemers and Benzes only to see the valet team treat their car like a run of the mill Toyota.",

Weird fusion food, an eclectic yet tasteful interior decorating job, wooden chairs (the ones that look like they could have come out of someone's old barn, but really they cost $500 each from Restoration Hardware), mismatched, waitresses who look like they could work nights at El Hefe in their booty shorts, and an open floor-plan concept. It's got it all.  If you don't know what Mexican-Asian fusion food is, don't worry. No one else does either. But it's dang tasty! I like that SumoMaya sounds like it would be way too off-the-grid type of food to be enjoyable, but they actually do a good job of separating their menu into a Mexican category and an Asian category so people don't get too freaked out. I ended up having the Duck Breast, something I thought I'd be going out on a limb ordering, but it was amaaaaaazing. Very tender, full of flavor, and I would happily order it again.  I didn't have any cocktails, but my friends had plenty of them since we were there for a birthday, and everyone had great things to say about their drinks. I tried one of them, the Passionfruit, and it was to die for. It's similar to a margarita, but they mix in some ginger beer for a little zing and a little fizz, and you should definitely order it.  All in all, great experience. The service was pretty slow. I was the last to get my drink, and all I got was a red wine, and the last to get my food (but it was duck breast so I'm cool wit that). Otherwise, it was great, and our server was very nice.",

We met a couple of times around our grounds and have had conversations in which he had shared with me about his new restaurant in north Scottsdale and extended an invitation to visit. I took him up on it last Friday and I have to say that I am very impressed! The atmosphere, the music, the design and decor, the service and the food were all excellent! I am typically not into fusion type restaurants, however, in this case, because it's only working with and fusing 2 amazing types of cuisine flavors - it works! I highly  recommend that you visit, experience and enjoy the establishment of SumoMaya. You will absolutely be happy that you did and want to return again and again!  Enjoy and cheers!",

    "text": "First things first: Make a reservation. I decided to play it safe and reserve a table for 6:00 p.m. on Saturday evening. At first I thought I was probably over-cautious with a reservation so early, but the dining room was packed! I think the only available seating was around the bar, which was humming.  As everyone else says, the space is open, colorful, breezy and beautiful. I loved every little detail--the vases, lights, knick-knacks, intricate metal candle holders, all with a heavy dose of bright magenta pink and orange. It was trendy and welcoming and just right. The open garage door walls made for perfect summer dinner ambiance.  Our server was sweet and explained the menu thoroughly, and gave us some recommendations. Our haul:  -Sake sangria for me: sake, cucumber vodka, ginger, other assortment of flavors to make for an absolutely refreshing cocktail  -Traditional guacamole (I'm eyeballing the pomegranate/dried fruit gauc for next time) and house-fried chips. This was magnificent. The queso fresco and citrus notes of the chunky guac made it some of the best I've ever had in a restaurant. To be honest, I think it's a little silly that you only receive 5 chips in total (and they are amazing--crispy and perfectly seasoned) and another order of chips is $1. But I don't want that to take away from how delicious this dish was.  -Mushroom tacos: Perfect little street tacos with AMAZING smoky-grilled mushrooms. These were perfection. I could eat about 10 of these, if left to my own devices. I put a little leftover guacamole on mine---tastebud party.  -Shishito peppers: Shishitos have become a personal obsession of mine over the past year and if they are on the menu, you can bet I will order them. The ample portion came tossed in a delicious soy caramel glaze. Word to the wise, these are marked as Vegetarian on their menu, but are topped with bonito flake (dried fish flakes). Seeing as I'm becoming increasingly \"meh\" in my vegetarianism, I just ate the ones on the bottom. I wasn't passing up these beauts!  Finally, I chose the sumo green roll to round out the meal. A perfect portion of a veggie roll, topped with a tasty tomatillo salsa. Boyfriend had the lamb chop, which I thought was a teensy bit tiny for $12, but he said it was absolutely delicious.   We thought we couldn't handle any other food, but then our gal ran through the dessert list. HOLY. We ended up on their take of a tres leches cake, topped with toasted whipped cream, drenched in what seemed like melted ice cream (I'm sure there is a more fancy word for this) with a side of chocolate crispies (again, I'm sure something fancier than what I'm describing). It was honestly? Life changing. The other desserts sounded just as amazing. Mexican chocolate lava cake with a horchata drizzle? Trio of paletas?!  All in all, what a perfect addition to the neighborhood. If I'm feeling like a special occasion dinner, I'm probably choosing Sumo Maya!",

The guac was terrific but everything else we ordered, which was a bunch because every order is so small, was mediocre at best. In addition to the small portion sizes, the prices for those small sizes are rather high. Finally, the atmosphere was not appealing... too loud with music pumping throughout the evening. For a place that seems to consider itself to be \"fine dining,\" having constant and loud music was disconcerting. Was looking forward to trying this place for a long time, but now I'm in absolutely no hurry to return.",

    "text": "Hands down best food I've had in a long, long time. It's an Asain Mexican fusion inspired menu which features some amazing food. My best friend and I do dinner at least once a month and are always trying out new spots.  We have uniformly christened this as the official mac daddy. Here's why...  Ambiance is fantastic. When all the sliding glass doors are open the whole restaurant is patio like. With the A/C  running full blast you never feel the wretched AZ heat, yet it's like your dining al fresco. They even have a very large tree (albeit fake) inside the restaurant. Aside from at least 15 4-top tables (which I'm sure can be slid together to accommodate large parties) I saw inside, there are also few half booth half tables. Not to mention they have a large patio with booths, tables and high tops.  There's not only a sushi bar to sit at but also a \"kitchen bar\" which surrounds the open kitchen. Pretty cool. We sat a the bar ( which is rather large, and features 2 large projection television screens ) to take advantage of happy hour. Their bar stools cushioned seats with backs (plus!)  On to the food/drinks...  Their drink menu consists of 15 or so specialty cocktails. (All $2 off on happy hour) Some martinis, some frozen, some on the rocks. All have interesting ingredients that you wont find in many places. I tried the \"Coconut\" and the \"Kumquat\". Both were fantastic. They also have a lengthy sake menu. Aside from several specialty beers on draft they have \"Patron\" on draught. Ice cold tequila shots that aren't watered down? Yes please! They have a decent wine list as well.   To eat we ordered several things to share. First round was the bacon wrapped dates and wild mushroom tacos. Both were stellar. The bacon wrapped around the dates was cooked to perfection. The chorizo and queso fresco filling was warm,creamy and paired perfectly with the sweetness of the dates. It was honestly one of the best dishes I've ever had. The tacos weren't close behind in flavor and will be ordered again. (FYI during happy hour you can 4 of ANY of their tacos and a 32oz beer for $14)  Second round was the braised pork belly, coconut mussels and the mango habenero salmon ceviche. The pork belly was demolished almost instantaneously because well it's pork belly and who doesn't like pork belly!? The mussels were served in a delicious coconut, lime and ginger broth. They were the biggest mussels I have ever seen and tasted very fresh. Melted in my mouth. I just wish they were served with something to sop up the glorious nectar the mussels were served in! The salmon ceviche was decent, I wish there was more of a kick to it. Just needed something but that's probably just me. The salmon itself was very fresh though I must say.   For dessert we opted for the trio of creme brule. Kumquat, chocolate raspberry and green tea were being served that night. The green tea was my favorite. Perfect way to end a delicious meal.   Finally, our bartender Katelyn was great. She helped guide us through the menu and recommended several of the items we ordered and she was spot on! We will be back to see her!",

    "text": "This is a tough one. I wanted to like this place. The decor is drool worthy and honestly, no other restaurant in Arizona even comes close on that front. The good ended there, not once but twice, for us.   - We asked for the sushi menu and were told only brunch menu will be served until 3 PM. It was only 11:30 AM. Disappointed but we went ahead and ordered. While we were eating we notice multiple tables around ours eat sushi! Their website still says they serve lunch from 11 to 3PM. The least the server should have done was mentioned there was some confusion. IF that was the case.  - Hubby didn't enjoy his dish much. The manager, not the server, casually asked how the food was and he told him it wasn't good. The manager nodded and left. That's it. It was day one of brunch for them. Feedback would have been crucial.   - dessert served. The lava cake was pretty good. It came with a shot of cocoa which was supposed to be served warm according to the servers description. It was cold and clearly didn't go well with the cake. Told this to the server who walked away as we were talking to him when another server called out to him. He came back but no apology! Forget good service, the service here lacked basic manners and etiquette. Insulting to say the least.   We loved the modern eclectic vibe and my crab meat with poached egg was wonderful, but, sadly we are never going to return.",

You get to choose anything on the starters menu, however they will only bring you two at a time. We had sushi, oatmeal, the sweet breads, and my favorite the black bean hummus. (There was more to choose from, we just had to stop so we could continue on the menu!) next, you choose one item from the main dish, and then you may choose all side dishes (they have 4). I got the Cuban breakfast sandwich, which was delicious! My husband chose a brisket meal, which he enjoyed. We ordered a Chinese sausage fried rice and chorizo potatoes, which were ok. Now, you think you've eaten enough, and can't fit anymore down, but you still have dessert coming! You can't skip dessert when it's included in your meal price! I chose what was basically a deconstructed cheese cake, and it was to die for good! My husband chose the cinnamon chips, which were also great (but not as good as the cheesecake). In addition to the bottomless brunch, for $10 more you can have bottomless bloody Mary's or margaritas, which my husband added to his meal (I stick with iced tea). It was a great experience and you should definitely treat yourself sometime to it!",

I have dined here three separate times and had three very separate experiences  the first time we dined there was in the evening on a Wednesday night, there were two of us. We were seated immediately, had the greatest most bubbly server who took great care of us. We also both have food allergies, so she was excellent with that.  The last time I dined here, and was excited to take my friends before a alumnae meeting. There were planned to be 6 of us. When I walked in, a friend was already waiting so I went up and said \"We have a party of six.\" the hostess just stared at me blankly and then said \"well do you have a reservation?\" mind you, this was at 4:30 in the afternoon and the restaurant was DEAD, completely empty. I said no, and she proceeded to address the business men next to us, who had a reservation and got them seated.   Maybe ten minutes later she still had not said anything to us, and finally she came over and asked if we could sit in the corner booth, which was fine.   The next  crappy part was our service. We had a taller dark haired woman as our server who was simply annoyed we were sitting there. I tried to crack a joke and she just looked at me. We had arrived first so we ordered wine and some guacamole. Our other friends got lost so they ended up showing up 20 minutes later and the waitress had the same crappy attitude towards them. We also asked for advice on which Pinot Noir and which Malbec to drink and she rolled her eyes at us. It was a very bad experience compared to the first one.  Overall, I don't think I will be going back there, mostly because I'm not quite sure why you have to have a reservation at 4pm, why the hostesses are very snotty, and why the service is so inconsistent.",

We had a few of the sushi rolls, the Korean beef tacos, the Chilean sea bass (our favorite), and the shaking beef with rice. Memorable night!",

He was very welcoming and we certainly enjoy coming here.   Service: due to the loud music, our waiter couldn't hear us multiple times. We repeated ourselves throughout the entire time we were there. Nevertheless, he tried his best to give us good services and it is certainly appreciated.   Food: I ordered the Mexican shrimp cocktail again. It is still delicious but unfortunately it was a bit sour this time. Yellowtail sashimi/sushi and Eel sushi were absolutely delicious. Their pork belly is juicy and the carrot cake light enough to give you just enough sweet at the end of the meal. Their cocktail drinks are amazing! GREEN \"MAGIC\" MOJITO\rwas what I had and I couldn't have enough of it  Rating: this is still my favorite restaurant in AZ. My only complain is how loud the music is. It makes it hard to talk with friends, but it is certainly a good place for a girls night out",

We often come here for dinner and have their fresh guac/miso salmon/kimchee rice and ceviche!!! Their toffee cake is also off the charts...and we find ourselves here for dessert after a meal elsewhere. Definitely always hip and happening with continuous amazing music by the in house DJ.....service can be slow at times, so just be wary of that. Otherwise a perfect place to impress your out of town guests and give them a True taste of Scottsdale.",

Shockingly the mix wasn't that odd, some dishes infused both types of cuisine, some were just one or the other. That said, it kinda worked. Even so the food was average. I'm from Seattle so it'll take a lot to impress me with sushi, I got the tempura roll recommended by our waitress, the shrimp tempura came on top the roll and was a baby shrimp, not my fave. We got some steak dish as well, which was well prepared but tasted too salty.   The service was great. We sat at the sushi bar and watched the chefs making food and fresh guacamole in the open kitchen. Our waitress was sweet and very attentive. Cool vibe inside, funky and fun, huge screens for watching games. Nice open space.",

Cultural mash-ups easily slide into really bad restaurants who try to force gimmicks too hard at the sacrifice of good food or tact. I was envisioning refried bean sushi and raw fish tacos served by sombrero-wearing ninjas.   Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is not a mash-up, but more of a conjoining of two of my favorite cuisines in the same restaurant. Good Japanese and good Mexican food. Sure, there is some fusion between the two - but they were gentle and in dishes that made sense.   And the dishes were beyond good. They were great. Delicious. Perfectly prepared. Impeccably plated. This makes this place a perfect date restaurant. It is no wonder the place was packed with misty eyed couples + packs of tight-panted dudes/dudettes scoping out the meats on display.   Special mention to the Cochinita Pibil, guac, ceviche, and sushi. However, one might pass on the calamari, which was the weak dish in that it was merely ok because it was too salty/oily.   Be sure to make reservations and ask for one of the tables that are at the threshold of indoor/outdoors, which are cool enough to sit \"outdoors\" but far enough away from the large/distracting television screens.",

    "text": "Only reason I'm giving this a 4 star as I'm sitting here at the place writing this is the service.  First time here and had a few friends that highly recommended this place after making a brunch reservation and it was really good like they said.   For the price and area this can't be beat bottomless drink of choice with unlimited side servings and one main dish make this place perfect for brunch. When walking in the vibe is upbeat and modern. The cook area is wide open to watch them cook and you can sit right in front of them and be served. In the back is a sushi bar if that's what your craving and you also have a few outside places to eat as well. Great spot for a group or like us a perfect date.   The food was amazing all the way to the dessert but like mentioned before the service was slow. After being sat it took probably 15 minutes just to place our first order   It felt like the server kept forgetting what he was doing and attended to the bigger tables more then anything.   This won't stop is from coming back what won us over was the food and atmosphere.  Must stop here if you're in the area for the weekend.",

We came here for a 5pm Saturday night dinner with some friends. Made a reservation ahead of time became we did our research and read the reviews online. Pulled up to this venue and saw they offer complimentary valet services which is pretty sweet! When we walked in we were greeted with smiling faces (the hostesses always set the tone for the night (IMO)). Anywho, they sat us in the center of the restaurant which is a perfect view. You get to see this spectacular tree in the middle (go figure). And you see the bar in the center, as well as you see the open kitchen concept which is nice. Is it just me or when you see open kitchens you just feel a bit safer, like oh they don't have anything to hide lol! I had a Patron margarita that was super delish. And I ordered the steak tacos which had great flavor. The mixture with the jalapeno and avocado was a nice touch.   The one thing I have to highlight is the Traditional Guacamole as our appetizer! My fiance isn't a big guac guy (what's his deal right, lol?). Even he loved it and I think this one has converted him. Happy he gets to enjoy what he's been missing, but sad this means I'll now have to share lol! I honestly can't even pinpoint what made it so good! Prices are reasonable and dishes are shareable. We'll be back.   FYI- I kept saying how cool this place is but never pulled my phone out to take pictures. I think I just thoroughly enjoyed my experience and I didn't even touch my phone. That right there says enough. Go visit for yourself!",

Prices aren't super pricey and the ceviche was comprised of a generous portion of 3 types of fish (Rainbow ceviche).  Had to try the tacos and got the Mahi Mahi which were also a generous portion and very good.  The spicy scallop handroll (my measurement at sushi places to see how fresh the fish is) was alright, not that great, too creamy imo.  But the service was really great after they got going though they presented me with a bill which was missing items and then charged my card the higher rate, which is understandable but they should pay more attention to details.  That's why the 4 stars vs. the 5 stars but I'd come here again for sure.",

Not only was this a fanatic place to eat, the restaurant itself is super fun and has a great atmosphere.  Starting with the cocktails which were about as good as they come, we had a scallop ceviche, one of about 8 ceviches available on the menu. For our main course, we had the Asian cod. Both dishes were outstanding and on par with any world class restaurant.   Dessert followed a similar trend, and were the we had on our trip.   12/10 would do again. A must if you are in Scottsdale.",

Their weekend brunch is one of the best deals in the area. We did brunch on a Saturday morning and they have tv's for football, they had an artist playing the guitar and the weather was great in October. I have Celiac and need gluten-free options and they have quite a few. I'm partial towards the Enchiladas Suizas because they are excellent every time. My wife got the pork burrito on the brunch menu and really liked it. The French Toast looked good but you need to like a more sugary breakfast/brunch. The Pad Thai is good every time and has some good spice to it. The hamburger was a great presentation but you need to like pickled vegetables or get them on the side.  This is a staple for us, and we'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "WOW, am I really the 1000th review? Better make this quick.  SumoMaya is a trendy fusion brunch place for the hipster crowd. It's 100% the kind of place I would bring my sorority sisters if they ever visited me in Arizona. I can imagine this place is fun for dinner too but I came for the bottomless brunch as an early Valentine's Day date with the boyfriend.   PROS: - You get to order unlimited appetizers, sides, and desserts - in any order you want - and get to wrap up the entree to take home. - Food presentation. - Trendy atmosphere and music. - Bottomless drinks = yes. - An interesting menu with unique combinations of food. - Service. They had a few hiccups like forgetting some orders and you get served by ALL the waiters, meaning some wires get crossed when ordering, but it's honestly not a big deal.  CONS: - Majority of the unlimited brunch appetizers were just so-so; nothing tasted so amazing that it blew me out of the water. - The three sides I ordered (both kinds of potato hash and the sausage rice) just tasted like salt and weren't that good.  BOTTOMLESS APPETIZER REVIEW: - Sweet bread: Probably my favorite out of the appetizer menu. There was two kinds of bread but I preferred the yellower one. I devoured this entire basket on my own.  - Tres leches oatmeal: I was most excited to try this dish. Unfortunately, it just tasted like plain hot oatmeal with walnuts. However, it comes with a dish of sweet milk that you can pour over the oatmeal, and that makes a world of difference. Once you've poured the whole dish of milk, the oatmeal becomes a LOT sweeter. I guess it's good because if you don't like sweets, you can adjust the sweetness of your oatmeal. But I'm just thinking, who is ordering TRES LECHES oatmeal and doesn't like sweets?! I thought maybe the oatmeal would be sweet on its own without needing the milk. But no. You need the milk for sure. P.S. The milk dish comes with a surprise at the bottom... little candied apricots or something!  - Pomegranate guacamole: This was a must-try because of all the reviews I saw about it! Honestly, it just tasted like plain guacamole, and the pomegranate pieces just looked cool.. that is, until you get some of the candied apricots. Forget the pomegranate, the pieces of apricot is what made the guacamole stand out. The chewiness and sweetness of the apricot combined with the guac was amazing. Boyfriend and I debated ordering another one of these but we were way too full.   - Sushi platter: 6 rolls. I can't really comment because boyfriend ordered and ate this instead of me, but he had no complaints  BOTTOMLESS ENTREE REVIEW: - Wagyu steak: Boyfriend got this wagyu and egg dish. The wagyu was just OK. They were, in my opinion, VERY heavyhanded on the lime juice. Seriously, it was like drenched in lime. I felt kinda meh about this dish.  - Al pastor pad thai: I ordered this extra spicy and it was just a smidge spicy, but it wasn't bad. At first I was disappointed because I usually prefer my pad thai sweet, and this one is more on the sour side. But it actually grew on me after a few bites - I think the combination of ingredients work really well together. Definitely happy with my order!  BOTTOMLESS SIDES & DESSERTS REVIEW: - Wok fried potato hash: This just tasted salty and bland. It looked exactly like the other hash side, and I honestly couldn't tell which was which after I tried both potatoes. Waste of space in my stomach. My boyfriend said this \"tasted slightly better [than the chorizo hash] and more Asian but they're basically the same.\"  - Chorizo hash: Salty thick potato taste. Not good. Tasted exactly like the wok fried potato hash, honestly. Save room in your stomach and just order one side.  - Chinese sausage fried rice: On the other hand, this didn't taste salty enough. In fact, it tasted like nothing rice. Pass.  - Liquid cheesecake: AMAZING. I thought it couldn't get any better. Honestly, the cheesecake tastes really good on its own, and I feel like the berries are just for presentation. I could seriously come here for the bottomless brunch and only load up on desserts, and no appetizers. LOL.   - Bunuelos: I thought nothing could top the liquid cheesecake, but I was mistaken. These cinnamon chips are incredibly good, and I don't even like cinnamon. They are drizzled with caramel and tastes amazing.  Sumomaya has some cons, and not all the dishes were spectacular. Still, I had a good time, and there is enough variety in the menu that you can find a dish you enjoy enough to get your money's worth and load up on. Also, the atmosphere and level of service make up for any subpar appetizer or sides you may have encountered. The whole vibe of the restaurant just screams FUN. I could definitely imagine bringing my girlfriends here and loading up on mimosas while we rehash whatever ratchetivites happened the night before.",

    "text": "Came here for Sunday brunch, this place was POPPIN. Seriously. Loud, busy, and had a vibe of \"Sunday Funday\"... prepare yourself. That being said, I really love the bottomless brunch option! $29 for unlimited brunch sides, one entree & dessert. Hard to beat.  We shared the black bean hummus, pomegranate guacamole, scrambled eggs and chefs assorted sushi rolls.   The black bean hummus was an amazing! I am going to attempt to remake it at home because I can't stop thinking about it. The pomegranate guacamole was so fresh and bursted with flavor. The eggs were not my jam, too much cheese and oil for me. The sushi rolls were really good, I would have loved if the server pointed out what each one was since they were assorted.   For my entree I chose the chicken enchiladas. The flavor was SO good, the pomegranate seeds on top just made the dish stand out. The sauce was a bit heavy with oil but other than that, I enjoyed the dish.   We ended with both desserts. The cinnamon crisps and liquid cheesecake. I am a huge fan of cheesecake and this was definitely an interesting take on the traditional dish. The flavor was good but I wasn't blown away. The cinnamon crisps reminded me of churros in a bowl, I loved them.   The inside is super trendy and has a lot of seating both indoor and out. Come dressed to impress because it's a bit fancy! I am not dyeing to go back but if I had a crowd to impress or friends from out of town this would be a fun place to take them.",

    "text": "Too bad you can't give an asterisk.  I really want to like this place. Haven't been this interested in the fusion of dramatically different but complementary cuisines since the first time (and second, and third, and..) I set foot in Chino Bandido. Arizona Restaurant Week seemed like a good time to check out a few menu items. In theory.  The place was already rocking when we showed for our Wednesday 6:30 reservation. No biggie, the place has ample seating. From the time we sat, thought, the service just seemed to lag. Not for lack of folks flying around. Everyone I saw was busting ass. Maybe understaffed? I noticed our server had tables both inside and on the patio. Problem is, SumoMaya is a 50-60 minute drive from the West Valley. Long way to go for an okay meal.  The food and drink: I had the Pimm's and my wife the Lychee cocktail. Both were really nice cocktails. We'd order them both again. In fact we did.  First course we had the fruit guacamole and the fried garlic & chile edamame. I believe the guacamole was pretty good, but the tortilla chips served with it were so over seasoned you would never know. You've had edamame a million times, right? These beans are worth the price of admission ($7 on the menu). Just the right amount of smoky garlic and chili pepper slices.  Second course was the Al Pastor Pad Thai (our consensus favorite DOTN) and the other was.......wait for it.....um......\"excuse me, I was wondering about our second entree?\" Probably 15 minutes after the Pad Thai came out, after asking about the rest of our meal and being told \"the food is just brought out as it is ready\".  Except that the 1st entree shouldn't be almost gone and at room temperature by the time the other dish comes out. What if I'm not a good sharer? The second entree was the crispy chicken mole. So, servers were slammed, order was overlooked, finally caught and literally thrown together on a plate. There was probably close to 2/3 cup of the mole sauce drowning what should have a really cool presentation. Crispy chicken? It never had a chance.  So, in summary, SumoMaya showed us some wonderful glimpses of what they can do, just not tonight.  Hopefully we'll get back there and update. Problem is, there are a ton of great places to eat between our house and SumoMaya.",

    "text": "We came for lunch at around 10:30am and there was no one there so we got seated right away. There's a parking lot in the back of the restaurant and we didn't have trouble finding parking but during the busier times, it might get a little difficult.  I think everything I've eaten here has been followed with an \"interesting...\" because the combinations of ingredients in their dishes are things I wouldn't have thought of but they make it work. They have an open kitchen, bar seating for the kitchen, bar seating for the sushi, and a bar in the middle of the restaurant for drinks.   POMEGRANATE GUACAMOLE ($14) - This is probably the best chips and guacamole I've ever had. I've never had pomegranate in my guac before and I never knew how much I loved the combo. In addition, the \"chips\" are big crispy tortillas sprinkled with tajin which makes it unbelievable tasty. Typically, I always have chips leftover because I use a lot of guac for tasteless chips, but we actually had to ask for more chips because they were so tasty on its own. Really recommend. 5/5  APPLE-SALMON ROLL ($13) - This is the first time I've ever had apple in my sushi (I'm sensing a trend here). The apple actually added a sweetness to the roll as well as a little bit of crunch. 4/5  AL PASTOR PAD THAI ($14) - This restaurant just has so many dishes I'm not used to and this is another. We saw this and had to order it. They asked for our desired spice level and we asked for mild. It was not spicy at all and we had to ask for sriracha to kick it up a notch. I thought there was too many bean sprouts that took away from the noodles and meat. 3/5  KOREAN BEEF TACO ($9 for 2) - I thought this was okay. It's a little overpriced for your typical taco and I didn't think the flavor of the beef had any Korean in it. 2.5/5  TRES LECHES CAKE ($10) - Very sweet and just the way I like it. The only thing is I wish the cake itself was soaked in the milk more so it soaks up all that flavor, but it was not so we had to soak it ourselves. 4/5  One thing I've noticed is they like to put sriracha in a lot of their dishes. They even have sriracha in their Golden Triangle drink, which tasted pretty good. The decor is really cool and the service is great too. This is a really cool place to eat; I would definitely recommend trying it out.",

I HIGHLY suggest getting their pomegranate guacamole. You won't regret it.  My bf and I shared a bunch of their dishes: apple salmon roll, al pastor pad thai, korean beef tacos, and tres leches cake. He drove so I also got the Golden Triangle drink. This was by far the most interesting drinks I have had during my trip to Arizona. It had a whole concoction of thing most notably sriracha and cracked pepper. It almost tasted like salted sweet plums that I used to have in Vietnam. My favorite entree was the apple salmon roll. The al pastor pad thai was good but I had to add sriracha to it. We did order mild but usually mild on a thai based dish is usually leaves a sting on your tongue. This did not. I wasn't the biggest fan of the korean beed tacos or the tres leches. I had high hopes for both but neither delivered a taste I'd care for again.   All in all, I liked all the different items in their menu. I'd highly recommend going here and just trying some of their drinks and their guac. If you have time for a whole meal, I don't think you can go wrong here.",

    "text": "What an excellent brunch! I went here this past weekend with 9 others. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. The decor was modern and they even had a little live music going on.   For brunch, they have a menu where it's basically unlimited food with the exception being the main entree. Oh, and the best part, for $10 more, you get unlimited cocktails, but the big downside here is that once you pick the cocktail, you can't switch to something else. Your options here are mimosas (passion fruit, blood orange, basic orange), bloody mary, or draft beer. We all chose to go the route of the mimosas and they were amazing. Our waitress never let our glasses go empty and even offered to top them off right before we left.   The food was good all around. It was brunch so it's a little hard to mess up or be divine, but I'd say for the unlimited amount, it was pretty darn good. They brought out some sushi, a couple different potato options, oatmeal, a couple egg dishes, guacamole, and some humus (everyone's favorite). If you wanted more of any of them, you just ask for it and they'll bring it.   For my entree, I did go the somewhat plain route of the churro waffle, but it came with some ice cream on it so it was amazing. Others got fried rice, chicken sandwich, enchiladas, and the steak. All of them got a thumbs up.   My only criticism is that while we did get seated quickly, we had to wait 10-15 minutes before seeing our waitress to give her our initial drink order and then another 10 minutes for her to take our food order. Again, once that was all done, the glasses never were empty and the food came out at a steady stream so I didn't take any stars off for this.   Thanks SumoMaya for a great brunch!",

We only had a couple of hiccups, I had called to make a reservation and was told they didn't take reservations. When I got there I was told they were fully committed, but could sit in the bar. We had a fairly large party so that wasn't going to work. Luckily after discussing it they were able to get us in. We had a great waitress but the entree took a little long after the appetizers.  Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars. Will be going back! Super fun.",

Pad Thai was so overwhelming sweet. It was the worst dish we ordered.  Rock shrimp appetizer was over breaded that it reminded me of breaded sweet and sour Chinese food you get from Panda Express. Not worth the price tag.  Steak dish was really salty and cost 25. Not worth it.  Steak tacos had nothing in it. A few pieces of meat, garnish............  Lastly, we had some sort of popcorn corn dish (I can't recall the name). It was decent.  It's sort of comical because the portions are pretty small but served on these huge plates that take up the entire table.   If I come back to this place, it'll most likely be for drinks and dessert. Our waitress was great and offered to replace our pad Thai but we declined.",

I loved the open kitchen, Lobster guacamole, carmelized plantains, and the Watermelon Shrubarita was the best cocktail ever. I may have to go back tonight!! I'll visit AZ just for this again. My only complaint is it's too loud. The music, who's is good, is bumpin' on club level. At dinner, I want to be able to talk without yelling. Very difficult to do here.",

And when I asked her to explain the \"evil ways\" of this confounding menu... she walked me through the maze of all roads lead to good. REALLY REALLY R E A L L Y GOOD. We stayed away from sushi, because, well, it's sushi. And started with a guac. If you eat NOTHING else off the menu, order the calabacitas guacamole. A thick \"porridge\" of corn, calabacita (squash), Oaxaca, and other deliciousness, coats a flavorful and creamy guacamole in this creamy/cheesy umami-packed guacamole and freshly pressed and fried tostadas. Made our knees weak.   We sampled a ceviche, traditional, chock full of perfect squid, crab meat, shrimp, beets in a flavorful tomato broth - light and scented with olive oil. Ceviche at its very best. Tacos are tiny, another one of their small plate offerings and also delicately large on flavor - so the tempura fish delicate and crispy was dressed in many layers of flavor. That is their \"secret\" layering flavors that are somehow related... but not, and making it work. Which bring me to the \"real deal\" mole in the crispy chicken mole - a take on general tsao's chicken. Flown in from Veracruz, they toss the chicken chunks in this richly flavorful sauce, served with sticky rice, sweet and green plantains.  Sorcery? Maybe. Whatever it is... it works. In big bold ways. In delicate and heated ways. Any way you cut it, delicious. And the staff? Wonderful! Kitchen, including Chef and his left and right folks? AMAZINGLY down to earth and happy people, serving happy and sexy food.",

Then we shared almost all of tacos and some sides - everything was delicious.  The reason that I would eat there every day for the rest of my life is the arroz verde. I've thought about that rice almost every day since.   Aside from the great food and delicious (yet strong) drinks was the service. Our server was phenomenal. He was attentive, engaging, gave great recommendations (calabacitas, for which we are eternally grateful) and was just generally fun to be around.  We were there to kick off a bachelorette weekend and he even brought out a dessert for the bride to be.   Thank you, SumoMaya for the best possible bachelorette weekend kick off! I will think about that arroze verde for the rest of my life.",

The place gets very busy and rightfully so, it's a pretty hip joint in Scottsdale right in the center of everything. I don't drink but their cocktail menu looked delightful. The waiter who served us was also exceptional and extremely helpful and accommodating to food allergies/intolerances. We ordered the pomegranate guacamole, calamari, a sushi roll (I believe it was the lobster mango one), and tres leches cake for dessert. The only menu item I enjoyed was the pomegranate guacamole which is so delicious! Calamari was decorated well for an appetizer but definitely not enough to share and the sushi roll was the worst I believe I've ever had at a fusion restaurant. I'm not sure if it was because it was cold or the texture and rice was just unappealing but after one piece, I left the rest for my mom, who left it for last.   Now the most disappointing part of my lunch...the tres leches. The meringue was so good but the cake itself was dry and just unappetizing. I expected more from tres leches, which is usually moist. I mean if you want to pay $10 for straight up meringue, order away, because the rest wasn't very edible.",

I was looking forward to the dessert. Skip ahead to the end of dinner, no dessert came. It wasn't anything to cry about but I was definitely disappointed as I had seen other tables getting the sparkler dessert and was looking forward to it.  That only knocked off half a star. We ate mostly the sushi part of the menu which was fantastic. Everything tasted super fresh and we were all happy about our meal.  Some things to take note of: it is extremely loud. Our party of 3 had a hard time hearing each other, and when our server was on the other side of the table I couldn't hear a thing she said. Drink service is very slow. We got our appetizers before our drinks showed up. Our server, very sweet, seemed to be over worked with quite a lot of tables, making us feel a little unseen. Overall I give 3 stars because even though the food was great, the service was lacking, the drinks took too long, it's was extremely loud, and in my option it was overpriced. Would I go back? Probably not.",

Honestly the best thing about this place is the vibe and decor. It'll be a fun night out with friends.   The food is woefully mediocre. I wanted to like it but literally everything I ordered (crispy calamari, crispy pork belly sushi and another sushi that I can't remember because the sauce took over all the flavor) was smothered in this weird generic \"spicy\" sweet chili sauce. Maybe if that sauce was on the side I could have tasted the food more, it was very overwhelming. I've never been to a restaurant where 3 different dishes were steamrolled by the same sauce.   Strange move.   The (thankfully) sauce-less asparagus was okay. Not bad but not great. I may try this place again if I go back Arizona but I'd for sure have the sauce on the side.",

It had a nice brunch feel and can see it being a place to have dinner as well.  I came for brunch on Saturday and was seated pretty quickly. On Sat- Sun from 9AM to 2PM is bottomless brunch. If you want a la carte or individual dish you can sit at the bar or you can come at another time. The bottomless brunch was $29 and extra $10 for bottomless bloody marys, margs, mimosas, micheladas, and draft beer which is a little pricey. You get unlimited shared plates (apps), one entree, and unlimited desert.  The guac was good. I like the pomegranate and dried cranberries in it; It added a nice sweetness but not overpowering and different texture. The tostadas that came with it was seasoned with more than just salt and it was good. Part of the unlimited is an option for assorted sushi rolls. I ordered multiple sushi plates. The rolls had good chunks of salmon or tuna.   For entree I ordered the wagyu steak and eggs. This was interesting. The wagyu steak did not melt in my mouth like I would hope. It had a little bite but the crust on the outside was nice, well seasoned. The plate also had a poached egg on a crispy wonton. I did not feel like it went together with the steak but separately they were good. Next time I would explore other entrees. My friend had the pad thai which was good.  The desserts were delicious, especially when you order both desserts and you dip the brunuelos (cinnamon crisp) into the liquid cheesecake brulee.",

If you like spicy, these are good. The dates were also delicious. I'd highly recommend them.   The traditional rolls were our least favorite. One was a yellowtail roll and I don't remember the other one, but it was either the California roll or an avocado roll. For the price, the rolls were not worth it. I've had much better.  We also had a couple of cocktails: the Green Magic Mojito, and the Pimms Cup. They looked and tasted great. My favorite was the mojito. I also tried the Chamoy-Mango Rita out of curiosity but it was not what I expected. All I could taste was the tequila, so I'd skip that one.   Overall, we enjoyed the service, atmosphere, and most of our food and drinks. The prices were a bit higher than expected for happy hour. I'd definitely try it again if the budget allows.",

We ended up sharing almost everything we ordered for the most part I am a somewhat selective eater, yet pretty much everything that they put in front of me I would enjoy. Me and my brother ended up eating calamari. Most of the people there seemed a little bit fancier than me and my brother siting there in streetwear but no one seemed to mind(I mean I do have to admit there we're a few other guys in similar attire but whatever). For some reason no  one wanted to sit at the counter, but I completely recommend it. It allows you to see the chefs while they make your food along with others food of course. Also because I convinced my family to sit at the counter we ended up ordering food we saw them make for other people, and there's even the fact that the counter had better seats . Overall the food was wonderful, the place had a nice aesthetic and I would totally recommend you visit it if you're willing to splurge.",

From the moment we walked in, the hostess was rude and nearly denied us a party of 7 on a Tuesday evening when the restaurant was empty except a few tables. We waited 20 minutes to be seated while watching 5 workers sitting around chatting with each other and doing absolutely nothing. Waitress was very slow and not welcoming. 10% effort was put into making sure we had what we needed. My water wasn't even refilled the entire time. I'll admit the food was great. Everything was super spicy but I enjoyed the spice. The prices would be worth it if the service was better but I do not see myself going back due to how poorly we were treated.",

There is a giant tree in the middle of the restaurant, large patio windows bringing in the Phoenix breeze, open kitchens to watch the chefs at work and a fun bar with tvs for the sports watchers. It has everything on the menu for meat eaters and vegetarians alike with really interesting spin on Asian-Latin flavors. We pretty much ordered all of the sides, shared guacamole and spicy chips, ordered a few rolls and noodle bowls and we were stuffed! For my vegetarian friends, the mushroom tacos were yummy but what I really loved were the teriyaki infused plantains, the popcorn encrusted elite, miso butter dipped edamame and guacamole. Skip the spinach and broccolini and if you're hungry, the rolls and bowls looked yummy. Service was a bit slow/sloppy but it was a busy Saturday night and the food and drinks made up for it. I'll be back!",

This Sunday I decided to bring my family for a special occasion - my mom's birthday. I thought it would be perfect. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Some of the food was too bland while other was overspiced. We ordered poke bowl and it was extremely spicy without a warning. We had to ask several times our waiter to bring the food out. Or to give us more coffee. Instead of this being a relaxing and enjoyable experience this was extremely annoying and stressful one. We waited for the first course for a long time especially for our favourite guacamole. The waiter brought just one guacamole for 7 people after I asked for 2 in the beginning. I had to ask 2 more times until he brought another one out. If I order food I expect it to come out for us to eat not ask several times for it. Our side dishes came out way after we were done with the main course! At some point we just sat there with a table full of dishes and no one bothered to clear them before our desert came out.  I was so disappointed that I kept on apologizing to my mom for such an awful experience. I am never coming back and I will discourage other people from going to this place!",

We had to ask our waitress 3 or 4 times for things and they don't seem to be educated on food allergies. She kept getting gluten free mixed up with Vegan and thought Vegan was Vegetarian. I know people with special food requests like that can be rather annoying but c'mon, if you're in the food industry, you should educate yourself so you don't make people sick.   I have to say that the food and atmosphere is pretty great. This place is like Asia meets Mexico, which creates some really unique flavors. They have various types of guacamole, which are out of this world. Everything is  small plate so it's perfect for sharing. I definitely recommend the pomegranate guacamole.   The one downside is that the food arrives as it's ready so that resulted in everyone getting their food at different times. Pretty much everyone was done eating by the time I received my friend rice. This concept is good for drinks and appetizers maybe, but not for entrees. The kitchen seemed to get backed up at times resulting in long waits. We waiting over 20 minutes just for a dessert to come...and it wasn't even right. Perhaps the managers/owners should take a closer look.  This place is good for smaller groups it seems.",

We had 4 apps-Guac, Rock Shrimp, Shrimp Ceviche, and Calamari.  All were over the top delish.  For entrees we enjoyed the Shaking Beef and Miso sea Bass-just enough food after the generous apps.  We completed our meal (reluctantly-never wanting the fun to end) with a Butterscotch Panna Cotta.  Now I have never thought I liked Panna Cotta-but this was fabulous-creamy with a buttery sauce topped with nuts and paired with a refreshing Mango Sorbet-unusual but delightful!  Even though it was a crazy busy night-Chris was always checking in and never rushed us!  Those Sabercats always know how to hit a home run!",

I decided to take my fiance here for his birthday dinner because we love trying new places & I've been to Central Bistro before off Camelback & loved that restaurant (same owners).  Our server was super friendly & willing to make recommendations-which I like. Service was fast also.  I ordered the Passionfruit Sangria which was great!  It is a tapas style restaurant for sure, so we ordered a bunch of food & tried a little of everything.  My FAVORITE pick off of the menu is the Pork Belly Roll- oh my goodness! This has a great savory taste, a little crunch, & its a perfect combo with the coleslaw they top it woth. Definitely recommend!!  The downside is you will either be waiting a long time or you need to make reservations.. I made mine a week out & they only had 2 time slots left for a Saturday..   Definitely will be back though!!",

She let us chill out in between ordering for each course, checked in just enough without bothering us too much, and constantly had our waters filled. The cocktails were excellent - I loved my frozen margarita.   Plus, the decor is great. It's a good mix of modern and southwestern prints and color without being too tacky or busy or cold.

It may even be my new fav place to eat @ in Old Town and I found the Latin/Asian fusion concept to be straight up genius!!  We showed up late and decided to sit in the bar area because they had a reverse happy hour going on which started @ 10pm.  It's also noteworthy to mention that this particular restaurant is one of the only places in town that you can get a bite to eat @ late night.  We were seated promptly upon arrival and our waitress greeted us right away and was very helpful & accommodating.  We tried several of the tacos off the happy hour menu, the bacon wrapped dates, the billionaire roll (which was out of this world - this was the first time I have ever seen a roll like this and yes it may appear to be a bit pricey, but soooooooo worth it!!), and we also tried the Vietnamese \"shaking beef\" which is their version of filet mignon - all the food was on point and I would highly recommend trying everything we ordered.  We also ordered a bottle of saki, which was very well priced and the server made it a point to continually check in to pour our saki for us, which was very thoughtful.  I would highly recommend this place to everyone and anyone who likes to dine @ a trendy local spot that plays good music, provides great customer service, and of course offers healthy delicious food/drinks - I mean ... what else could one ask for? ;)",

    "text": "This place is hot! Hot in so many ways! The menu, the vibe, the people!  A group of 10 of us came here as a dinner club event that we had last week. It may go down as one of my new favorite places in the valley. The atmosphere is hip, trendy, and cool. Music pumps through a pretty awesome sound system and the food and drink menu are not the norm.  Cool orangey- Mayan- hot pink decor adorn the place. And the slider doors everywhere give the place an 'outside being in feel'. A tree in the center give that feel too!  I love a place like that!  This is not your parents Mexican, err, Asian eatery! In fact, my parents would either hate it or love it! But I was beyond impressed.  We all started at the very crowded Sumo Maya on a night that had a ton of Ferrari's in the parking lot. The valet guy said there was an event that night and the place was full! As was the valet; as was the parking lot!  My boyfriend loved the place for the 'eye candy' Ferrari's alone in the lot! Once I was able to pry his eyes back to me and into the restaurant,we bellied up to the bar to wait for the rest of our group and reservation time.   The drinks are like the menu: different. The drink menu is vast and there are lots of cool mixology drinks to choose from , or the usual beers, sakes and wines. I started with a \"Coconut\", made up of pearl coconut vodka, ginger-lemongrass, a little lime and coconut water. I admit, I don't like 'sweet' concoctions, so I was a little worried I was ordering out of my comfort zone. I was pleasantly surprised when the Coconut arrived in a cute, little champagne glass. I believe the coconut water and lime cut what would be sweet. I had two of these and don't let the small glass fool you: perfect and 'hidden' strong!  We were seated promptly at our reservation time. Despite how busy they were! There was not an open table or bar stool in the place. I am very glad we had a reservation! My boyfriend and I ordered the fresh made guacamole with lump crab as an appetizer. I love a great guacamole. This was off the charts, amaze-balls. Tons of fresh lump crab pieces adorned the top of this delectable bowl of perfect guac. It is served with flat tortillas that are 'street taco' size. We also ordered the Rollo Chingon sushi roll; I guess we could not decide on one thing we wanted to start with on this menu! Who doesn't love great sushi with a spin? The Rollo Chingon is a roll of grilled shrimp, fresh guacamole, a spice of jalepeno, housed on a sweet strawberry glaze and 'fried' red lotus root atop. Again, this 'starter' was an ample serving for two. I could have made dinner out of this one roll. But, I am a foodie and I like to sample many things!  For dinner I ordered the Chinese Chile Crab Garlic Noodles. This dish was ramen noodles with shiitake mushrooms and just enough green onions and a hint of miso to offset the flavors.To me, it had a 'pad thai' texture to it, which I loved.  Beware, this dish had a kick to it! The lump crab on top once again, happily surprised me. The concept of SumoMaya is 'small plates' , but honestly, I had enough of this dish for lunch the next day. Yes. It could have been that we could not decide and ordered a few things! My boyfriends entree was the Pork Belly Ramen. Rice sauteed with shiitake mushrooms, pea leaves, adorned with tender pork belly and adorned with a perfect poached egg and scallions. He had paired that with a Skinny Margarita, again strong!.. from the bar. Since we share most of our meals, I liked this dish, as well, BUT, I loved mine more! The dessert menu sounded awesome, but we passed on that. Too many meals out lately and too many dishes here at Sumo made us feel like fat kids, already!  I will admit I see where Sumo can work on a few things. For example, our dishes came out 'sporadically'. One couple in our group was getting their apps while some were on to their entrees. The water glasses ran empty a few times. This food has spice! Those glasses need to stay full! The parking lot was entirely full. The valet, too. First world problems of having to walk a block from parking up the way to Sumo. AND the restroom is tiny. That said. I loved this place and am already planning a Sunday Funday here with the advertised bottomless Bloody Mary's, Mimosas and Micheladas for $15 coupled with brunch and live music! Football is here and this would be a great place to have brunch and drinks on a Sunday. Welcome to the valley, Sumo! Despite the few little quirks, I can't wait to go back!",

But the place is so noisy between the music and the crowd that it's impossible to have a conversation without yelling. Now, with ceviche and tiraditos on the menu, you'd expect pisco sour to be a staple. Not at all. The waitress didn't know and the bartender didn't have the ingredients. Not sure that it is worth a second visit.",

    "text": "(Lyrics - Alphaville - Forever Young)  Lets dine in style, lets drink for a while Bo Bites can taste we'll only review what we try Hoping for the best and expecting the best! Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?  Let us dine now or let us drink forever We don't have the power but we never say never Sitting in a dining room, start with ceviche The Shrimp heads for the entree  (Skip)  SumoMaya, Let's all go to SumoMaya! I really want to try SumoMaya, SumoMaya  3.5 Stars in my book!  SumoMaya is definitely one of the hottest restaurants in town.  The place was popping on a Wednesday night and my friends and I had reservations at 8:15pm, but didn't sit until about 8:45pm.  So we ordered drinks at the bar needless to say.  When we finally sat we went for it!  Lump Crab guacamole, Hamachi Roll, Hamachi Ceviche, Bacon Wrap Dates, Pork Belly Ramen, and Head-On Giant Shrimp.  The Lump Crab had a mesh of cilantro, lime, and it came with some tostada shells, which my gal pals thought was too hard.  I liked it overall as a starter; soft mushy guacamole and crab meat with an extra crunch of the tostada!  The Hamachi Roll & Ceviche was probably one of my least favorite -- The roll was atop with a pickled jalapeno pepper that just shocked my palates and the Ceviche came with a yuzu green apple aioli that didn't seem to go well in my opinion.  Leave the green apple out haha!  As for the Bacon Wrap Dates, I didn't care for these either since the charred bacon necessary to make a wrap was burnt and dry. The Pork Belly Ramen was good and how any ramen entree should taste like; nice warm broth and the noodles was cooked just right.  The star of the night for me was the Giant Shrimp!  Cooked to perfection as it carefully slide off the shell with the garlic-creamy sauce and a spicy hint in the end!  Along with the cherry tomatoes to finish off this dish giving it a final sweetness!  Best grilled shrimp I've tasted in a while!  Service was good overall and attentive as it was pretty busy that night.  The ambiance is hot as I stated earlier.  There was a large tree in the middle giving the restaurant an outdoorsy flare.  Designed by restaurateur German Osio and Chef Herb Wilson whom was inspired by a food truck in LA serving up Mexican-Asian food; thus spawning SumoMaya - Enjoy!",

I assume that they were fresh made and if the dough gets a little dry, that's the outcome. I would also get rid of the avocado.  The bacon guacamole was also good.  I asked for a sample of the strawberry gazpacho and it was tasteful but I guess a whole bowl would be really overwhelming. A shot is the perfect size for this dish, IMHO.  The bacon wrapped dates... mixed feelings.  And the porkbelly ramen noodles was highly disappointing.   The location is awesome, the build out is beautiful and it has a great patio. I was tempted to give them a 4th star just for that, but I guess I would be bias and would mislead whoever reads this.  However I say, give it a try. I will go back to try the sushi.  Cheers.",

We had couple appetizers : guacamole and chips , tuna tacos , street corn topped with popcorn and cheese dip with onions , peppers and corn tortillas. I had lobster noodles for my meal , which on description was described as pasta topped with lobster sauce, they basically topped noodles with peas , carrots and couple pieces of lobster. Would never order this dish again. Drinks probably are the stronger part of this place. We really enjoyed spicy peach and jalapeno margaritas.",

The patio doors were opened for our dinner last week but surprisingly the restaurant wasn't hot at all (I can't image the AC bill).    The menu was very interesting and it was hard to make a choice. My opinion of what I ordered - the Pastor Street Tacos (2 for $6):  The quality was great but they seemed smaller than street tacos which made me question the price.  Seemed very over priced to me, but yummy none the less - the Green Tea Cocktail ($9): refreshing but wasn't really strong either - the Pork Belly Ramen ($16):  This was fantastic.  Large portion, tons of pork belly, and just very well made.  I would absolutely order this again if I happen to come here again.  My friends ordered: - Shishito Peppers: pepper roulette she called them.  Some where hot and some weren't.  I don't typically order these but that is the norm for this type of dish, so I learned something new.  I tried one and it was very tasty. - Seasonal Mushrooms: Very yummy - Tuna Tacos:  FYI the taco is deep fried and not soft like typical street tacos.  Also very small like mine. - Bacon wrapped dates: there were about 6, maybe 8 dates in the dish.  My friend liked them. - Sangria:  Not very strong but yummy.  I would go back to sumo maya for a special occasion, the ambiance warrants it, but I don't think I would go back for just regular dinners out.  Just too pricey for me.",

Walk in a the place is very cool inside lots of seating options.  At the sushi bar,  at the kitchen bar,  at the bar bar,  tables or patio.  Lively place too with music going a good \"crowd\" noise that isn't overbearing but you also don't feel like you're in a library either. We couldn't get a table without reservations but any of the bar seating was available. So we sat at the kitchen bar which was a bee hive of activity. Very cool. Our waiter David instantly took over and started making recommendations. Drink choices were awesome! David went through the menu as fusion food can be overwhelming  with choices. We made a couple selections but thankfully David helped out with some.  The best way to order was what he recommended, family style and lots of dishes everyone eats from. The range of flavors from sushi to carnitas tacos is out of this world. The food was so incredible, not a bad choice (and I'll tell you I'm a pretty picky eater). The wait staff checked on us and brought food as ready.    Everything about Sumo Maya is top notch. If you go ask to sit in David's section if he's working. If you're willing, let him make recommendations and adjustments. Best waiter I've even had. Besides, with his haircut he has to be cool.....",

Wow. When I came back? Same story again and again! Great service, so fair priced, short wait. COMPLIMENTARY VALET...yep I said it.

Sometime multiple dishes came out all at once and then there would be a loooong lag before the next round, well after we had leisurely finished what was previously brought out..  With that said, I'd rather they be spaced out rather than rushed.  This is a fun place with solid food in a really cool environment.  I can't wait to go back and work through more of the menu.",

Not sure if there are any concepts like this that combine the Mexican and Asian cuisine so well.  Attention to detail is apparent.

The Korean beef tacos and the pork belly ramen were both easily 5 stars. I'll be back.",

He actually seemed to enjoy it as well which made it frankly, a little weird.  We'd asked 3 times for forks but were never brought any.  We'd been served our appetizers which 3 of us couldn't eat with the chopsticks on the table.  It's Mexican/Asian fusion so you'd think they might consider that not everyone eats with chopsticks and set the tables with forks - but there you are.  Regardless, after asking a 3rd time and still not receiving forks, one of us got up and happened to find the manager and ask for some.  Dang if that guy didn't cop an attitude right away, get defensive, then rude...and then almost sneer about it every time he later passed our table.  To say it was off-putting really would be an understatement.  This guy is dead weight.  They need to lose him.  How hard is it to say, \"Hey, sorry that happened?  Let me get you some.\"    The food was delicious though - all of it!  Try the bacon wrapped dates, the calamari, the rock shrimp and the tacos!  The rolls were great too!",

    "text": "So I was raving about this place until I went for happy hour on a Friday afternoon. It was 4:50 when we asked to be seated in the main dining area because they opened the door/window panels in the middle of AZ summer. 5pm came and I had to argue with the brunette, frumpy, lumpy and ill-mannered head hostess to seat us inside because we were sweating like hookers in church (by then). She had the audacity to ask us to make reservations next time. The dining room was 95% empty. The food...I went during the week and it was phenomenal. I ordered the guacamole crab app again but this time they topped with a tea spoon of crab versus the plentiful amount of yesteryear. Bottom line: don't go to this restaurant on a Friday or Saturday night because you'll get bad service from staff and inconsistent food quality from the middle chef.",

But when my first sight upon entering was hostess flanked by a DJ and she had to lean in toward me just so I could say my name right into her ear, I quickly realized this \"restaurant\" is more of a club on a Saturday night.   We were told our table would be ready in 5 minutes. To the bar we went, fighting the crowd to be able to order an overpriced glass of wine - the brand of which is permanently on the bottom shelf of the wine department of Walmart - if you were wondering about the quality.  We were in a sea of 40 and 50 somethings who were so plastered that I know their children would be embarrassed and mortified to see them. It was very much the norm and very pathetic. After waiting 30+ minutes, with a headache mounting from the thumping bass, we bailed and opted for the Italian place right next door.  The drunk soccer moms in stilettos on the sidewalk out front showing us their version of sumo wrestling was a fitting last impression.",

I'm a fairly petite person, not looking for huge portions at all.  But the new taco size here, at least on the fish, is absurd - especially at the price.  These are the tiniest little tacos I've ever seen, when the waitress brought the plate I just stared at it I disbelief.  She saw, and volunteered that she'd been getting lots of negative feedback.  What makes it worse is that the fish tacos used to be wonderful.  They took a good thing and ruined it.  And my margarita tasted like it was watered down.  Seems like a lot of cost cutting measures going on, and it shows in very negative ways.  On the positive side, the charred edamame is still delicious and addictive.  This place used to be a favorite of mine, but based on my recent visit, I'm not likely to go back any time soon.",

I'll keep it short and sweet...don't go here if you have a group of more than 6, and whatever you do don't ask the checks to be split from the start. Your waiter/waitress will give you a snotty look then proceed to tell you that you can't pay with more than 6 cards. Oh wait, the waitress didn't even do that, she went and got the manager (completely rude and unhappy guy from my perspective) who proceeds to tell you \"it's too hard to split it because the servings are shared.\" We proceeded to get horrible service after that point. It actually all started before when we tried to make a reservation and were told we would have to wait 3 hours for 13 people. The place was empty and clearly they didn't want the group. I could keep going about how horrible it was but I said short and sweet and already said a ton. Never again will this place get our money. Two large sports teams from the area will be sure to spread the word about how they SHOULDN'T go here. Epic disappointment!",

The big TV's above the bar were blasting fun 80's and 90's music videos and kept our table dancing and singing in our chairs.  From the outset the concept of fusion Mexican and Japanese food intrigued me.  Would there be enchiladas with a sushi twist or fajitas spiced with wasabi?  The food wasn't quite along those lines but pretty inventive nonetheless.  The taste was pretty similar to the South American Asian fusion cooking I've had a lot here in DC.  Out of everything I loved the miso eggplant (the sauce was amazing) and the kimchee fried rice (very big portion size).  I also tried the sumo green roll, but it didn't blow me away (I didn't like the hard plantain chips with the soft rice).  The pour size for the wine was big and our waiter was super nice. He didn't hesitate to take the uneaten edamame off the bill, since the charred flavor didn't win anyone over.  The Phoenician I was with said it was her new favorite restaurant as we lumbered our way to the car with our full bellies.",

In all fairness when we complained about it they took it back but unfortunately the one they brought out was also super salty.

Being open a month you would think they would have produce to make a salad. Three items we tried to order they could not make. You will be disappointed and still hungry if you only order one item on the menu. For two people expect to spend $90 plus. The concept sounds like a fun idea but so far Sumo Maya has poorly executed it. The music is obnoxiously loud and unnecessary. Oh and food comes from two kitchens so expect food to randomly appear at your table. The experience was like hanging at an old town bar except that is not the experience I want for dinner service. Parking is valet only and very limited so be ready to fork out a tip for the \"complimentary\" valet. Recommendation i s to not waste your time and money. Changes will need to occur before going back. For Asian just go to Tooties across the street.",

My friends love food and have great appetites so we tried several different dishes.  Two friends are vegan and shared their dishes and said that they enjoyed most of their meal.  They especially liked the kimchee fried rice.   The rest of us shared a plethora of dishes.  My favorites were the sauteed eggplant and the rock shrimp appetizer.  We also enjoyed the pork belly ramen.  The broth was smoky and delicious.   Friends had the rock shrimp sushi roll but said that the tuna in the roll took away from the shrimp itself.  The rock shrimp appetizer was so delicious and you could taste the truffle oil.  We also had the Korean beef tacos which were good and the tempura cod tacos, which I would probably pass on next time.  The pairing with sauce, veggies didn't quite fit.  Our server was as friendly as could be however I think she became a little too busy for us as the night went on.  She forgot to tell us that the kitchen was out of the sea bass which we ordered and only found out about after we realized we missed it at the end of the meal.  Some of the other servers and hosts came to help serve dishes and were somewhat attentive during that time, although we did have to ask for a few things multiple times from different servers before we received them.  Overall the food was great.  My out-of-town friends really enjoyed the meal and experience so I'm happy I chose this restaurant for our celebration!",

And when I say a hair ball, I'm describing  a clump of hair that resembled a small group of hair that was pulled from a drain cover in your shower, just on a smaller scale. Waitress indicated that she was \"confused\" because no one tending bar had hair similar to that hair color.   Regardless,  manager was \"too busy\" to come by and acknowledge that there was even an issue. The kicker was I never wanted anything for free just a replacement drink, which took 20 minutes to receive, yet the waitress made a comment that made us feel like I planted the hair, and perhaps felt I was scheming for a free meal or something. Bottom line, I didn't want anything, but perhaps an apology from a manager on duty.  In any event, to suck a bunch of hair through a straw is simply disgusting, so we clearly will not be coming back to this restaurant, and I provide this review simply as a warning and precaution to others. I will file a complaint with the health department on Monday, and  if nothing else, hopefully create an inspection to make sure things are where they need to be overall. Maybe this was an isolated incident, or maybe it is something that could be expected in the future...nonetheless i was made to feel like someone looking for a handout, when all I wanted was a replacement. I don't typically leave reviews, but a manger on duty not having the decency to even acknowledge our issue,  makes it certain that a negative review is necessary. Take it or leave it, but after our experience I think this place needs a second thought from anyone thinking about frequenting this establishment.",

We sat at the bar and there were 2 bartenders working at the time. We sat there for at least 10 minutes, we were never acknowledged not even a nod.. nothing. Please keep in mind the restaurant was not crowded at all.  We sat there a bit longer in disbelief of the treatment received at this point. Just as we were about to leave we see, a young lady walk up and takes a seat at the bar, within a few moments she was warmly greeted by one of the bartenders with menu in hand???? Seriously, wow??? Please understand this is not the first this has happen.  We have received this same treatment twice before.  Since it was a Sunday evening we hoped the service would be better...not the case. We asked to speak to the manager on duty. We spoke to the manager and she apologized profusely and offered us a meal on the house, which we refused.  Why would we want to have a meal at a place that clearly did not appreciate having us there as a guest?! The manager on duty promised the general manager would follow up with us to discuss our poor experience at the restaurant. Well it's been five weeks since our visit to SumoMaya, we have yet to receive a phone call...   SumoMaya- thank you for showing usthere are other restaurants nearby such as ...Paul Martins, Postinos and Fleming's who are consistent in providing an excellent dining experience for all their guests.",

The presentation is amazing - every dish looks like art! We had the ginger fried rice, the Suzuki Roll, and the apple Apple - Salmon Roll. Really good. Oh, and just from watching that one perfectionist plating the food, the carne asada guacamole looks amazing!",

We were seated in about ten minutes, even with a reservation and a half-full restaurant. We thought, based on reviews, that it was somewhat romantic. Not even.   We were seated in plastic garden chairs and brought water. Our server then took our drink order. As my iced tea was delivered, she took our food order: Ginger-fried rice to share; scallops for her and a spicy crab roll for me. Her wine arrived five mins after the food. Drinks after food?  My sushi roll was okay but nothing special. The scallops were a bit small for the price but again, okay. The ginger fried rice was good. My hesitation?  The side dish was the best item.   Service was very minimal and didn't stand out. Even the parking was weird: valet only but the cars were only parked 20 feet away. Was it to force tipping?  Not sure.   Big disappointment in SumoMaya.",

And we were seated directly and our server came in to get our water as we waited for the The rest of the party we decided that we wanted to sit outside and they were very courteous and moved us outside. Our waiter Josh came in and he was one of the best service I've ever had in my life just because he was attentive very knowledgeable and very wanting to accommodate us To the best of his ability. We had the unlimited breakfast brunch with the Moses so was about $39 each plus tax came to about 45 bucks a person. The serving sizes for the appetizers that you share were great we were able to taste a little bit of everything everything was great the seasoned and had flavor. When it came to our entrees I ordered the coconut pancakes which were really amazing however they were kind of small but I understand why because the rest of the menu was quite large and then we had the cheesecake and this fried something for dessert. Will I be going back to SumoMaya yes I sure will. And I do hope to have Josh and Sarah as I service again",

    "text": "Sumomaya is a fun, trendy fusion restaurant. I've been here several times both for lunch and dinner and have always been impressed with the food and drinks. The decor is funky, and I love the giant tree in the middle of the space.   My favorite margarita is the Jalapeno Monk {sauza blue silver tequila | jalapeno infused green chartreuse | lime | pineapple | mint | cucumber} and is a must have if you like spicy drinks!  I've had a few of their different options but I generally start with the pomegranate guac. Their sushi is good, but it's not the more traditional style that I really love so I haven't tried much of it. I've had the Billionaire Roll and the pork belly roll, both were good. The rock shrimp tempura is great, I love the spicy/sweetness of the jalapeno sauce. It's probably not their healthiest menu item but I definitely recommend it. I would also recommend the tuna tacos and carnitas tacos. For sides the Mexican street corn and shishito peppers are a must have!   Come to Sumomaya if you're looking for a trendy date night spot or an evening out with the girls!",

    "text": "Interesting unique dishes, excellent service, and fun decor!   My friend and I stopped here on the way home from a cycle class at CycleBar. We were both pretty hungry!  The place was not too busy on a Sunday morning at around 11/11:30 am but suspect it's packed later in the day/evening.   The decor was fun and interesting with brightly colored pillows and cushions on the booths.    Our waitress was attentive and detailed with the menu information.  I had decided on an omelet that included mushrooms. The waitress let me know that the mushrooms are very smoky and to make sure I really liked the smoky flavor (I do not). So, instead, she was able to let me make a custom made veggie-omelet. It was so good; it included mushrooms (not smoked), spinach, and tomatoes.   My friend ordered one of the sushi dishes and the duck/green tea waffle combination.   She enjoyed all of her food.   I suspect the parking could be an issue later in the day/evening. This is in a tight shopping center, with apartments to the north.",

    "text": "My husband and another couple just had the WORST experience I've EVER had at this place.  As we were having diner, a few girl friends that were at the restaurant came over to our table to say hello. Unfortunately, the tables are very close together and our friends were getting very close to another table having dinner. Without any provocation this guy gets up out of his seat comes to our table and begins to throw the MF and F bomb and tries to grab one of my friends. Both our husbands had to get up and ask him to calm down. I had to go run get a server and ask for the mgr. when the mgr came over she spoke only to guy who was causing all the issues. Her way of dealing with the situation was to move this guy to another table. At no time did she EVER come to our table to apologize for what we had to go through.  Our server never apologized or even acknowledged what happened!  In fact, others around our table were horrified at what took place and told us they would help if needed. After this all died down I  went over to speak to the manager Cecilia.  I asked her why she did not feel it was appropriate to come to our table to talk to us and to apologize for what we had to endure. She said that this guy told her that he asked nicely many times... which never happened. I understand it is her responsibility to calm situations like this down. However, this was completely mishandled by this establishment and general manager. I will NEVER come back here and will be calling the corporate office to discuss further.  If you want eat at a restaurant who does not have good customer service skills or who can make you feel safe in their own restaurant then this is your place!  There are MANY other amazing places to enjoy in Scottsdale. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!",

The tree in the center of the restaurant is an awesome idea. Great place to meet up anytime of the day.   Although all the drinks on the menu looked amazing, we only ordered two, and they definitely didn't disappoint. So yummy!   I was really confused when the waitress explaind the menu as \"tapas\" style. Definitely confusing because when she explaind it further it sounded more like and \"ala carte\" style, which is exactly what it was! And although confusing the service was so amazing. Totally accommodating and fun.   Every dish I tried was on point except the Pork al Pastor Pad Thai. I was expecting to have a hint of pineapple or a nod to the peanuts. Not the case. Although good, it had neither and left me feeling disappointed.   All in all the food was amazing, service nice and warm, and drinks well made. 4 stars for the entire expirence but not 5 because of the convoluted explanation of the menu and disappointment with the Pad Thai.   TLDR: Food amazing, explination of menu confusing, order many things you won't regret it.",

    "text": "Went to SumoMaya with some rowdy lady friends last weekend and LOVED IT!  The decor is modern & sexy (complete with low-lighting), and the DJ plays absolutely fabulous music- lots of current pop and hip hip.   IMO, SumoMaya definitely has a \"dinner night club\" vibe and isn't a spot I'd suggest if you're looking for a quiet, low-key romantic dinner.   However, for a night out with friends it's perfect!  I started off with the superfruit sangria and it was delish! One of my friends tried the passion fruit version and it was way too tarty and not sweet enough. Needless to say after she sampled a swig of mine, she sent hers back to swap.  We tried a bunch of different starters and all were uber tasty- the pomegranate guacamole was particularly good. It has pomegranate seeds and dried cranberry in addition to the traditional guac ingredients. It only needed a tad bit more salt to be truly perfect. They serve it with enormous round crisp tortillas which are very good.  For my entree I had the rock tempura shrimp and it was delectable to say the least. Fried to perfection with a very yummy sauce! It was a more than generous serving also which was a plus.  We visited SumoMaya on a busy Friday evening around 6:30 and I will say that our server was less than attentive. There was definitely a lag between each of us getting our entrees even though we all ordered at the same time. Some of us ate while others sat for an additional 10-12 minutes waiting on our food! If they improve that aspect of the dining experience, SumoMaya will be worthy of another star. Would visit again!",

They bring items out when they're ready, so your guest can be waiting for food, while yours is getting cold sitting in fromt of you, this is not cool. Most kitchens know what table is ordering and will start the fast cooking order a little after the slower cooking one.",

    "text": "I love the concept behind this fusion restaurant. I found the interior to be stylish andcwell-appointed. The waittress was attentive, but I found her a little pushy and upselling (\"you absolutely have to get the guacamole...\") to be kind of annoying and intrusive. We found the prices expensive for small tapas dishes. Our party had mixed reviews on the food. The guacamole was unique and flavorful. Some of the tacos were just okay.   Something bizarre happened while the food was being delivered. A woman brought a bowl of miso soup and stumbled when putting it on the table. She spilled abiut 20% of the bowl's contents on the table and into the dish that the bowl sat on. She literally did not say a word about it - she just walked away. We thought she was going to get a towel, but nope. She never came back. We had to clean up the spill ourselves. We told the waittress about it and figured a manager might come by to apologize for this blunder, bit nope.  After the meal I asked my whole party to rate the whole experience fron 1 to 10. There were two 5s, a 7, and an 8. The 8 came from my seven-year old daughter.   I love the idea of the place but there were definite failures of execution.",

Our first time here, we sat for dinner on Christmas Eve and felt ignored by our server the whole night.

Hopefully we had a one off experience because I really want to love this place.",

    "text": "If a Hostess tells you all tables were reserved and absolutely no tables left, this place must be beyond amazing, right?   We dined during the Friday happy hour mad rush between 5-6PM. They did find a table for us.  However, we just needed to be out by 7PM for the next reserved party.  We ended sitting in the back patio area. It was HOT HOT, and not just for the beautiful interior design. The shade and water mist didn't help much with the high humidity that day. Our Waitress was superb! She quickly ordered and got our food.   We ordered a few items off their social hour menu and dinner menu.  I guess the Asian side in me that I'm always skeptical when it comes to Asian Fusion. I was sold and impressed on the quality of their dishes. We tried a few of the street tacos - Wild Mushroom, Korean beef and Pork \"Al Pastor\". They were grilled, so juicy, and incredibly flavorful. The traditional guac was just ok for me.  I do like the tortilla chips that came with it. It didn't taste like the typical restaurant chips. It tasted homemade sea salt tortilla chips.   Another dish I highly recommend off of the dinner menu is the Chinese Style Chile-Crab Garlic Noodles. It's not Crustacean Garlic Noodles, but will still satisfy your garlic noodles craving with just little spicy kick in it.  I will have to return and try it with their many cocktails too.   It's a trendy and loud place. A great place for girls night out, date night, or bring out of town guest. It is complimentary parking valet. You might be able find an available parking space by the bank if you dine after 5PM. Parking spaces are limited. The parking lot is shared with other businesses in the same area. Park at your own risk!",

We later were told by the bartenders that the kitchen had mistakenly didn't make our other roll and were doing it at the moment. They were very apologetic and gave us the roll free.

This place is loud and full of energy so not the type of place you'd want to go for a quiet, romantic dinner. It gets busy so call ahead for a reservation. We went for a birthday dinner and they surprised the birthday girl with a slice of cake lit with sparklers :)  To me, this is more of a tapas spot where you share most dishes rather than order your own individual meal. That being said, if you're super hungry, you'll have to order a bunch because the portions aren't huge. I'll definitely return, especially to enjoy the vibrant ambience. Next time I'll probably go to enjoy drinks and appetizers rather than a full dinner.",

    "text": "Update to my previous 2-star review:   Jason P from SumoMaya reached out after I posted my last review. He offered to have me and my date back for sort of a redeeming dinner, \"the real SumoMaya experience\" in Jason's words. I have always enjoyed this place, so I was happy to go back. As I said in my previous review, this place is cool and the food is good, I suppose I happened to be there at the wrong day and time.   The food was very enjoyable. This time we tried the Ecuadorian ceviche and the guacamole, both delicious by their own merits. The tostadas that came with the appetizers were extra thin and airy, not your typical tostadas but quite delicious nonetheless. I had the scallops, and my date had the Mexican Pad Thai, which I would imagine is what my grandmother from Sinaloa would have made had she been left alone in her kitchen with a combination of Asian noodles and Mexican ingredients. We closed the deal with a delicious dessert, which frankly was difficult to finish given the amount of delicious food we had consumed at that point. The drinks were great as well.   I appreciate that management reads these reviews and take proactive steps towards improving their customers' experience.   Thanks to Jason and the staff for a great evening!   ****  The first time was amazing. I had the Mexican Pho, the rollo chingon and many of the other specialty rolls; I remember being very pleased with the food, the service, and the ambiance. The second time I went for brunch, and though I was not particularly mind blown by the simplicity of the food and the lackluster service, the bottomless mimosas made up for it. The third time was not as good.   I had family visiting from San Diego, so I figured I would treat them to a different kind of brunch experience. Unfortunately, the hostesses had these weird condescending attitudes about them that just set the wrong tone from the get go. The three women behind the counter were as hospitable as the big tree in the middle of the restaurant, i.e. not hospitable at all. One of them told us that they were booked, but the high tables were available for walk-ins. She lazily pointed in the direction of said high tables, so off we went. We sat at one of the four open tables, waited for a good 5-10 minutes for someone to bring us menus, got too hangry for that kind of life, so we finally  walked out.   I wouldn't say I won't be coming back as  you can't truly judge a restaurant by the actions of a few employees (and I really liked that Mexican pho). The concept is interesting, the food is good, but the service seems to be deteriorating at a rapid pace. Management would benefit from ensuring their level of service is up to par with the food and location of this establishment.",

    "text": "I was expecting better and as such was disappointed.   The good news was our waiter was terrific; helpful, attentive and generally a warm fellow. The food ranged from good to poor. The items that were prepared at the sushi bar were all fresh, interesting and tasty. The items that were prepared in the \"kitchen\" were mediocre to bad.   There appears to be no attention to detail with the hot items from the kitchen. The chicken tacos of $15 were dry, bland and frankly an embarrassment. The Vietnamese beef dish was marginal at best. The vegetables were cooked fresh but the beef was dry and seemed like it was cooked well before the meal was assembled.   The place was VERY load and full of groups of women that spent all their time either taking pictures of each other or looking at their phones. I have never seen so many groups of women at a restaurant at one time; it was clearly a \"seen and be seen place\" where they are selling an atmosphere and food quality is second to providing a \"hip\" social environment.   In summary; the food is OK but very overpriced, the atmosphere is unique but very load and the attention to detail is poor. I doubt that I will go back.",
