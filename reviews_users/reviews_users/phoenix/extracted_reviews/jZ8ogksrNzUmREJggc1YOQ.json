With all the large roomy booths available, we were stuffed into a tiny one situated right next to another table; oh well. Our server Jeff was really great; heck, even the guy filling up our water was pleasant.   We started by ordering two Manhattan's; they had both Woodford reserve and bookers, kudos for a fine bourbon selection. However, it seems like the bartender really shook up the cocktails instead of stirring them, as they both came out bubbly and watered down. The complementary biscuits, cornbread and relish tray were a nice touch.   As for the rest of the food, I was both impressed and underwhelmed. We ordered the clam chowder that had bacon in it, but sadly it wasn't as amazing as it sounded. The prime rib was amazing, cooked to perfection and melt-in-your-mouth good. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were bland. We ordered some type of smores in a jar dessert and I wasnt in love.   Overall we had a nice experience, but the prices are really expensive for what I feel you get. We had two Manhattan's, two glasses of wine, 2 entrees and a small dessert for $141. That seems a bit high to me.",

We arrived early and were escorted to our table by lovely hostess without delay.    Our waiter John was polite, helpful and the entire staff was attentive without being obtrusive.  I went with the recommended seafood chowder as John explained the chef was from Boston and knows how to make an excellent chowder.  It was thick, packed with seafood and was really tasty, but was not like other chowders I enjoyed while visiting the Boston area. I also ordered a salad with the recommended orange balsamic dressing (not really a fan).    The Ribeye was excellent, as was the baked potato although it was rather small. Desert consisted of chocolate cake that would have been excellent with a red wine if I had more time to indulge...  Overall we were glad we experienced it, however there was a birthday party two tables over. The staff delivered a cake with several candles and thankfully they didn't sing, but some obnoxious female in their party did and we understood when another large party got up from their table and left the restaurant before ordering. She was loud and was not entertaining. The staff was great, it's too bad the patrons weren't.   Overall this is a great restaurant with an incredible bar. They do have private rooms for parties and the atmosphere is really nice. Everything was clean including the restrooms. It is a little pricey, but not unreasonable considering the level of service, quality of the food and the atmosphere. We will be back, hopefully not at the same time as the singing patron.",

One of the oldest restaurant/steak houses in Phoenix, the Stockyard boasts classical photos, old school menus, and interior decor that makes for a unique place to dine at. They take reservations but there seems to be plenty of seating if you get here early enough. A variety of seating types to accommodate any group size. The menu is plentiful and many options. Unsure about a wine to pair with your dinner? Our server provided sample recommendations to choose from. Dinner starts with a small serving of veggies with ranch, and a small bowl of dinner rolls. A small menu in the center details the specials for the day. Our waiter was Bob and he was awesome. Very helpful and through, and our drinks were always filled. I had the rib eye and upgraded to the mushrooms on the side. My husband had the elk medallion and loved it. This was our first visit, and definitely not our last.",

Parker is so wonderful, she is warm and friendly but most importantly has great suggestions and is very attentive to the guests needs. I had the 12 oz. rib eye which was perfectly cooked medium rare and very tender along with the mashed sweet potato (has to be the best side). Parker introduced me to the house steak butter which is a combo of butter, garlic and sage and  it was wonderful not only on top of the steak but also complimented the sweet potatoes fabulously.  My husband had the 1/2 rack of ribs and they were tender fall-off the bone good and he loved his side of the cowboy beans that he raved about. Stating they were the best cowboy beans he ever had. For dessert we thought we would try something different and got the chocolate mousse. It was very thick and creamy. Of course the Stockyards has the very best biscuits and cornbread and topping it with the softened honey butter always makes this restaurant memorable. We will be back!",

The sandwich I had was pretty darn good, the salads my coworkers got looked pretty decent albeit with too little meat proportional to the amount of veggies, in my opinion, but I wish my experience with this restaurant ended here.  After the luncheon, I decided to bring my boyfriend here for his birthday, and well, I was sorely disappointed.  That amazing sandwich I had had before wasn't on the dinner menu, but that's to be expected.  What truly annoyed me, and leads me to write this one star review, was the snooty service.  We were given the smallest table in the room, with servers walking right behind me, in and out of the kitchen, and treated as if our patronage didn't matter because we looked like college students.  Of course, they might just have had horrible service in general and our age had nothing to do with it because I did hear an elderly couple nearby complain about their service as well.  But hey, this was just my experience, and you might have better luck than I did.  Though I'd recommend The Keg over Stockyards any day.",

That's cool though because I can't bring myself to eat a ginormous hunk o' muscle very often anyway. I can go years without ending up in a steakhouse and when I do it's generally a meh experience regardless of how orgasmic people tell me the slice of cow is supposed to be.   Saloon 1889 on the other hand is right up my alley. Hey, we all have our vices.   The atmosphere is pure Arizona. It's the perfect combination between the slightly nauseating Rawhide's folksy old-Zona and the Rat Pack old school Arizona exemplified by Durant's, with maybe a dash of Monti's La Casa Mediocre tossed in for good measure.   The bar is a massive antique-looking dark wood relic from another era, with ornate pillars and a huge gilded mirror along one side. The bartenders also look like they could whip you up a classic cocktail, the stuff with bitters, or a girly sugar bomb. They got skills.   The happy hour is really where's it's at here. Free sliders, chips and salsa. Couple bucks off the bar bites, which are substantial meal replacements. Cheap wine, well, beer, all delivered with a smile.",

I must also note that there is ZERO ambience-- it looks like a Best Western dining hall.  On to the food.  I had been craving prime rib, so that is what I ordered.  Though it was accurately cooked to be medium rare, the texture and flavor were not great.  The meat was bland, and it was not all that tender.  Even the au jus lacked flavor.  It was served with some sort of potatoes that I didn't really like either.  However, I have to say that my companion ordered the filet-- also medium rare-- and said that it was really good.  I am not going to give this place a bad review, but I can't give it a stellar one either.  Im addition, the prices are a little high for such boring food.  I am truly ambivalent about Stockyards.... and life is too short to eat mediocre food.  ;)",

    "text": "I want to start off with saying that everytime I drove by stockyards and saw that giant bull/cow on the top of the big, plain, white building, I always imagined it being a casual steakhouse with straw or peanut shells on the ground.   It's totally not.  It is like a rich Texan's house inside.  Cow rug, leather, old cowboy photos on the wall.  So the ambiance inside is totally nice and upscale-cowboy feel.  got sat in the main dining room and I also want to add like I felt like the place was \"dusty\" I don't know why, or what made me feel this way, but \"dusty\" was what I got from the place.  I ordered a half slab of ribs with garlic potatoes and a salad. So- my ribs were just \"okay\" and my potatoes were SUPER SUPER garlic-ey and it was weird how they were plated.  They came out like in a square shaped form of scalloped potatoes.  Like my mom makes potatoes and squares my piece out for me sort of square.  The square was small, but actually I didn't even like the potatoes so that did not bother me too much.  OH! and \"cole-slaw\" my other side I ordered was \"cole-slaw\". Notice how I put \" \" around this word \"cole-slaw\".  I do that because it wasn't cole-slaw AT ALL!?!?!? It was literally just shredded up dry cabbage!?!??! So... yeah, didn't eat the slaw.  their famour bar that is completely hand carved and the murals on the walls are hand-painted and restored from like the 1900's so the bar was very cool.   Go for a drink at the bar.  I wouldn't do dinner again.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to go to SY for more than a year, because I keep seeing it on my commute and it's advertised in Phoenix street maps. When I finally got there... I wasn't that all impressed. The decor is very steakhouse-y, with dim-ish lighting, big tables, leather booths, etc. The food was about 1.5 notches above your average Outback. Our table ordered the calf fries just to taste them, and they were gross. It was my first time eating them, and I've eaten a lot of gross things in my day (frogs, snakes, alligators, cricket teas, pork brain/livers, etc.) and this was up there. It came with a lemon wedge and cocktail sauce, but that didn't do anything for the taste of the testicle. It was like a cross between chicken liver (taste) and sweetbreads (texture), but with a confusingly fishy aftertaste. And I did give it the ol college try by eating more than 1 of them.   But given that it was my first time eating them, I didn't fault the restaurant for that experience. I got an 8oz prime rib, with a clam chowder and the parmesan potatoes, and au jus on the side. I didn't think their prime rib had a lot of flavor... maybe my piece was too small to get a nice searing on the outside, but without the jus, it was a bland piece of meat without a good beefy taste. The parmesan potatoes was like a napoleon, except with layers of potato slices and cheese in the place of flaky dough and custard. It was good, although I found some of the potato slices to be less cooked than others. And overall, the look of it was a little off, because the whole thing was off-white, and didn't have an appetizing crust/color on it.   The service was excellet and attentive, so 1 star for that.",

    "text": "Okay, I haven't been here in years and had been wanting to check out the area \"stockyards\" again since.  So Arizona Restaurant Week had them on their list and I thought, 'what better reason is there to go than this?\" Maybe it was the option I chose but I wasn't very impressed.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good but I was hoping for something more like the meal I've had at the Silver Spur in Tucson (OMG -Gooooooood stuff).  My prime rib was a small portion and seemed to have a lot more fat than mere marbeling.  The sweet potatoes were okay but heck, just leave 'em in the skin and serve 'em if you're not going to make them something special. Cornbread and Baking Powder Biscuits served before the meal were fine, but I make better cornbread right out of the box.  And what do they mix in the butter that created red looking drips?  Honey? I liked the crudites - cukes, jicama, celery, carrots, black olives.  My son, who happens to be a good eater, ordered the rack of ribs and hardly got through half the rack.  He said he was hungry but apparently didn't like the flavor. And he was about as impressed with the sweet potatoes as I was.  Desert was alright. Brownies a al mode for myself and son and hubby had the shortcake.  The special online menu that I viewed said it was mixed berries but the server said strawberry -that's what he got, strawberry.  It was all fine but I just felt that being one of the restaurants on the Arizona Restaurant Week meant those businesses were out to impress. I just wasn't impressed.  I love steak but about the only time I order it when I'm out is when we're at a steakhouse.    Love the decor and the history of the place.  Service was fine -except when I asked for a couple of biscuits to be thrown in with my leftovers.  That didn't happen.",

    "text": "When I want a pound of flesh I come to THE STOCKYARD for steak. Let's face it when you want a steak you defiantly want it coming from a business that builds its reputation on cattle. At one point The Stockyards of Arizona were the largest cattle stockyards in America with over 40,000 heads of cattle at anytime.   Now I came in tonight and ordered up a giant  ribeye steak seared to a perfect medium ( light pink inside) pulse a twice baked potato. My steak was sensational yet my spud didn't match My own twice baked style it taste. Yet it was a solid potato to accompany my meal. I started with a cup steak soup. A rich creamy base with plenty of steak bits with a robust flavor. Each meal comes with some choices and I could have also had the salad or chili to accompany my meal. I tasted my lady friends chili and OMG a winner. I'll be back for a bowl of the frontier chili for sure.  Wait staff was exceptional and informative. Waiter had a pleasant demeanor which made our family meal one of the best meals of the trip.  You didn't feel rushed to order. He was on top of our personal needs and provided a history narrative of how the restaurant was formed and shared with us about the famous handcrafted bar made of a single piece of wood.    Needless to say I'll be coming back very soon for another delicious steak. If I'm lucky maybe even desert. Come see why it's an amazing place and worth every penny you spend.",

I had the soup of the day: clam chowder. It was very well seasoned but I couldn't get to the quality of the clam meat itself because of that. My main entree was the steak burger and that too was well done. It was on garlic toasted buns and it was delicious. Coleslaw was good too.

A little on the pricey side, but if it is good...it's totally worth it. In the end, the place did not disappoint.  Pros: 1. Steak was cooked perfectly, I asked Medium and I got Medium. 2. The bread was very good. Can't go wrong with biscuits and cornbread. 3. Excellent service. 4. Along with the bread they had veggies at the table, which always a plus! 5. The steak actually came with two sides. Up in the Northeast you almost never see that.  Cons: 1. Pricey, but what steak house isn't  From what I gather the place has been around a long time, and if they keep pumping out food and service like they did when I was there I will keep coming back next time I am in the Pheonix area.

The mashed potatoes were positively delicious and my favorite part of the meal.  They have a good dessert menu and after-dinner alcohols.

    "text": "We were looking for a special place for birthday dinner and my favorite is steak.  We are new to Phoenix, so I checked reviews and we tried Stockyards.  We won't be back.  Good:  The service - our server was attentive, water was always filled on time.  Wine list had some nice selections.  We got the strawberry shortcake dessert for my birthday for free, which was awesome.  Bad: everything else.  Bread was OK, nothing special.  Crudities were clearly not fresh and the ranch dip/dressing was terribly watery.  My filet was cooked to order, but the server really talked up their carving and aging process, but I certainly couldn't taste it.  The steak desperately  needed seasoning and a nicer char on the outside.  I ordered the Parmesan potato stack based on the servers recommendation and it came out COLD.  I placed it on my bread plate and asked the server if they could warm it up, as it was basically inedible.  When it came back out (they actually gave me a new one), I was almost done with my steak.  It was definitely delicious, it's too bad it wasn't hot when they plated it so I could have enjoyed it with my steak.  My husband said his steak was good, but nothing special; same with his fries.  Again, seasoning was lacking.  It was a very pricey, disappointing dinner.  We moved to Phoenix from a much smaller city and our special occasion steakhouse has much better range of choices and significantly better tasting steaks for the same, or lower, price.  Seems like there are many other steak house choices here in Phoenix, we won't be back to this one.",

    "text": "This restaurant-saloon combo enjoys a location very near to Tovrea Castle, my favorite Phoenix landmark. So close are they, in fact, that if you handed the pigskin to a good college football player, he could throw it and hit the Castle from the restaurant's parking lot. The restaurant's decor and old-west ambience also deserve high marks, as does the staff.  Why, then, am I giving this place such a low score? Quite simply, the food is subpar. My companion met me in the saloon, where we sampled their sliders. Verdict: passable. Then we moved to the restaurant for the main meal. The pork porterhouse that I ordered was so bland as to border on the insipid. The shredded seasonal vegetables I ordered were unidentifiable, either by sight or by taste (we finally guessed that it was squash). My dinner companion's 8-oz tenderfoot tasted much better than my pork did, but I regularly cook better at home. The meal had one high point: my companion's side of sweet potatoes was quite good.  How much did this second-rate meal cost? After tax, $84.16. When one adds in the tip for the service, the total came to just under $100. If paying $100 for a subpar supper is your idea of a good time, then this is the place for you, partner!",

    "text": "This is easily one of the best steakhouses in town. I've been to many of them more than once, and steaks are simply superb. Not to mention the prompt, and sometimes over-enthusiastic service.  It was a rainy Tuesday, and although I am an extremely patient person, traffic and gridlock really vex me. So when I see the freeway signs warning me that there are prolonged stretches of road that are just littered with crashes, I either have to rant and rave to my wife as to the bad drivers; especially when it rains. Or, I can take a detour and pass the time away at one of our favorites restaurants.  My wife had another business symposium she had to attend in Tempe, and it always runs later than advertised. So, on the way back, we decided to cut through SR-143 due to the gridlock on the I17/I10. As I was barreling through this shortcut, my wife speaks those 4 simple words...\"When are we eating?\"  Well, it happens to be that I was by Washington St exit already, and just a block from the exit is Stockyards Restaurant. So, I quickly exited, and pulled into the drenched parking lot. Our appetites whetted due to our expectations of enjoying a great dinner here.  However, my wife who was dressed in a Business Casual outfit looked me over and was concerned that I was not appropriately dressed. I allayed her concerns by stating that I may not be dressed in Business attire, but my perfectly matched and stylish jogging outfit, and my matching Puma shoes would fit right in - I commented facetiously! I also assured her that after eating here for many years, their attire is quite casual.  So we entered the place, and lo and behold; nearly everyone we saw was dressed in either formal or business casual attire, and I stood out much to her chagrin. It didn't bother me the least bit as I have little care for the opinion of people I have no relationship with, but I could sense the trepidation in her demeanor.  In any case, they promptly and courteously seated us. And there began our wonderful dining experience, once my wife's uncomfortableness waned.   Our server, Chris, was just a wonderful host. He promptly mentioned that chef's specialties, and the unadvertised special of the Buffalo Ribeye with seasoned potatoes and Asparagus. I was immediately sold and had him sign me up. My wife had the Campfire Sirloin.  In a nutshell, she couldn't say enough good things about her Sirloin. And my Buffalo Ribeye was simply splendid. It was just an awe-inspiring piece of steak.  In addition, the service that Chris and the rest of the wait staff provide was spot on.   And to top it all off, by the time we made it out of there, the freeways had been cleared of crashes and traffic, and we were able to speed on home unfettered!   Not a bad experience at all for an impromptu dinner for the both of us for $140.  It was definitely worth our detour.",

The restaurant has daily specials and since it was Tuesday the special was Tortilla Soup as well as Tuna Melt. We all passed on the Tuna Melt but ordered the Tortilla. Our lunch entries were the half pound cheese burger with French fries, a French Dip sandwich and hot pastrami sandwiches with coleslaw. Honestly, I don't know who won the \"best lunch choice\" award. Each dish was expertly prepared with the highest quality ingredients and presented beautifully. The portions are generous. Service matched the high quality meals. The interior space is decorated very \"western\", highlighting the history of the Stockyard. Very impressive. Be sure to check out the bar, lovely decor and very comfortable.  We look forward to going back for dinner. My only suggestion is that you call for reservations. This restaurant is clearly very popular and for very good reason!",

    "text": "I came here with two of my work colleagues while on a business trip. We had been researching nice steakhouses and saw plenty of raving reviews for this place. We were not impressed.   Right off the bat, our waiter seemed to be annoyed with us. I don't know why, the place was empty on a Tuesday night, but I presumed because of our age (all about 25), he might have thought we would not tip well. I am only making assumptions though. Since I always leave at least a standard 20% tip, I had a very hard time giving our server that. I did though due to my guilt and not wanting to be hated, but my colleagues I was dining with all gave me a hard time for leaving such a decent tip. The couple of busboys who came out with the bread baskets & water, on the other hand, had a lovely attitude. I hope they got some tip share with what I left our server.  Prices are reasonable as far as this type of steakhouse goes, but not worth the price. I ordered a NY strip steak which was pretty flavorless. I ordered medium rare, and it was just not juicy at all. Our server did not even have us cut into our steaks and ask how they were. I would have expected that at a place like this. I have had a much juicier and flavorful steak at much more casual, chain steakhouses.   With the steak you get a choice of a couple of the sides (not the exhaustive sides list). I asked if I could get a different side and the server told me there would be an upgrade charge. Fine I said, thinking it would be like a differential amount, but not the full price of the side. Sure enough, when I got my bill I was charged the full amount for the side. So I paid for my additional side, but didn't get a side which I was entitled to with my meal. It would have been lovely if he would have told me to get one of the included sides as well if I was going to be paying full price for the side I picked. Speaking of this side, the creamed spinach, this was definitely the highlight of my meal. Well lies, my glass of Malbec was the best part. The creamed spinach was the second. The third most delicious part of the meal was the jicama on the raw veggie plate they bring to each table as a starter.   The others in my party were equally unimpressed. As we were here on business, we had been saving up our dinner budgets for a few nights to come here and left disappointed.",

So disappointed in our service I can't even tell you. Thursday night. Not that busy. Was a manager on duty?? They never came by? Food forgotten. Drinks went unfilled. Left to sit for long periods of time. Actually said when dropping off check  \"Was everything ok after it all came out?\" BIG surprise he was attentive then!! We saw him more then than we did all night. My husband actually wanted to leave 2%!!  We left ten percent on a $180 bill. While leaving I asked front hostess for something tiny my daughter wanted.... plastic picks of some kind. She went to check and came back and said \"Was your waiter_____? With a beard?\" (I will at least be nice enough to not put his name.) We said yes. She said smiled and said \"Yeah he said we don't have anymore of those.\"  Checkmate.  Anyway. If you want to drop a lot of money and pay a large bill for good food and then 20% tip on top of it for poor service come here. Otherwise I think your money is better spent elsewhere.",

In more cases than I can recall, a place with the history and legacy of the Stockyards would have fallen into complacency long ago, milking the same group of dedicated customers and giving less value to anyone who's not a regular. However, our visit was great from the moment I made the reservation.   The menu is very traditional, and they've even played the retro angle by bringing back a prix fixe option that includes Steak Diane. We opted for the Chateaubriand for Two, and it was some delicious melt-in-your-mouth beef. No complaints on the service, either.   As far as attire goes: It's a fancy restaurant in some ways, but remember that it's in Phoenix, and that it was originally located next to one of the largest feedlots West of the Mississippi. You won't look out of place in jeans and a polo.",

Steak 44 is 44th and camelback,go west to Donovan's They have a walk in wine celler and a GREAT wine list' DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!",

    "text": "I came here for a work lunch, which is my excuse for being a vegetarian in a steakhouse. Not that surprisingly, there aren't many vegetarian options but there are salads and 1 wrap/sandwich. I got the pear salad and really liked it, but thought it was a bit on the small side. It's a classic combination of sweet pear, tangy cheese, and spicy pecans, and they do it very well. Thankfully it comes with buttered and cheesy bread crisps, which makes the salad a little more filling.   Overall, the service was okay. The waiter kept interrupting our work talk with questions on how the food was, which gets tiresome after the first time. I found the room we were in to be on the loud side, though there weren't a lot of people in it, so the acoustics are a little off.",

I guess once upon a time, it was an actual stockyard.  Now, it's an old school restaurant that has a lot of character.  After browsing the menu, I opted for a BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich & Fries, $10.  To wash it down, I ordered Iced Tea.  The Pork Sandwich was awesome, very tasty and a large portion.  You will get full.  The Fries were tasty as well.  My client was impressed with the restaurant and put it on his \"best place near the airport to have a lunch meeting\" list....+++  The service was great and we were able to have a good lunch meeting that left us both satisfied.

I ordered the potato soup and it was the hit of the meal.  My steak came to the table ill prepared. The waiter recognized it and sent it back for a new one without making me feel like I was at fault. I ordered the stacked potatoes but wish I hadn't. They weren't great. Overall, nice experience. There is a separate bar area, too, made of mahogany with murals.",

    "text": "Stopped in here with my husband, his nephew and girlfriend for dinner last week. It was nephew's birthday and he loves steak so I wanted to take him special. Since this was the oldest steakhouse in Phoenix and a historical landmark for the city, it fit the bill. We all enjoyed our meals. My fillet was cooked perfectly. Nephew said his ribeye was a little salty but personally I enjoy some seasoning on my steak. I don't like it when places serve it totally plain... or worse, with a bunch of butter. A steak should be juicy enough to stand on its own with just a little salt and pepper to enhance the flavor. I did enjoy that we also got a very rich and beefy demi-glace as well (served on the side). I also liked that you get your choice of starch included with the steak as well as a soup or salad. I ordered the sweet potato mash which unfortunately I did not care for at all. There was something off about the taste and it wasn't as smooth whipped as I would have liked. I did really love the soup, though. That night it was a cremini mushroom bisque that was delectable. It would have gone really well with a good earthy red wine but unfortunately I wasn't drinking that night. Other people at the table enjoyed a few beers. They have the usual domestic and European choices as well as some taps from local Sonoran Brewing Company. For dessert hubby and I split the strawberry shortcake and they also brought out a chocolate brownie a la mode for my nephew. So nice!  Overall, maybe the food was only worth about three stars but checking out the old photos of downtown Phoenix and all the cowboy art on the wall made it a cool experience. I really liked the old school saloon as well. This is definitely someplace every Phoenician should come at least once.",

Our server was attentive and pleasant and did reasonably good job of explaining all the various menu choices.  I want to say up front, it was good. NOT great.  I had the $50 cut of Prime Rib and there was a lot of inedible gristle and fat in it. In addition, our server had made a mistake on my order and at first brought out the small cut, and had to return it to the kitchen for the correct order.    The taste was OK, again, not great.  Two of the kids had the filet, and it was GREAT.  I would have it next time.  The stacked potatoes/parmesan were quite salty.  Two of our guests had bison, and enjoyed it.  I just don't think it was remarkable, and the final price tag of over $500 (including a bottle of champagne) would prevent me from choosing it again.  IF I did go, it would be the filet for sure! For that much money I expected more.",

Both were wonderful starts to our meal, of course after scarfing down the biscuits, muffins and crudite that they serve when you first sit down.  For our entrees, we both went with the filet mignon and parmesan potato gratin stack.  The steaks were cooked to perfection, the bearnaise sauce was killer and the potatoes were incredible!  I'd never had those before, and will definitely be getting them anytime we dine here.  The ARW menu included dessert, and we weren't disappointed.  Hubby got the pecan pie and I got the chocolate mousse.  What a wonderful way to finish off our meal.  Everything was delicious, the service was spot-on and the atmosphere of the dining room was somewhat romantic.  We had only sat in the front dining room on previous visits, but this time, we were escorted to the back dining room (past the bar) where we were met with soft lighting and old-fashioned murals on the walls, which seemed to transport us to a time long ago.  What a wonderful night!",

I would absolutely NOT recommend this place. If you're going to spend this kind of money, go to Durant's.  Ribeye: Texture/Quality is very sub-par. No flavor. They claim they cook with gas, but I'm lead to believe it's a griddle with gas heat underneath. There was no char or flavor to the steak.  Buffalo Meatloaf: No texture, bad flavor. Someone left this in the food processor for about an hour too long. It's extremely mushy.  Potato Stack: These aren't bad. A little mushy, but not bad.  Wedge Salad: Overall very good. However, their bacon is like dust. It's more like powered bacon.",

However the patrons were in attire ranging from jeans and sneakers to heels and dresses.   I sat at the bar and was attended to fairly quickly. I ordered the 5oz filet, it comes with a potato of choice (I went with the baked potato) and a choice of soup or salad. I chose salad considering the rest of my meal was going to be fairly heavy.   They brought out complimentary jalapeno corn bread and honey butter along with an array of vegetables and dip (extra points for being creative). The cornbread was phenomenal. This could have been because I was starving, but it took a lot of will power to eat only a half of one.   The salad was nothing special, just a house salad, but it was fresh and the homemade balsamic was really good.  The filet was tender, juicy and flavored perfectly. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. The baked potato was a bit too loaded. I'd guess at least 1/3rd cup of butter. I scooped most of it off but I don't even want to begin to think about how many delicious calories I consumed there. My suggestion would be to ask for butter on the side so you can control how much goes on.   The guy at the bar next to me convinced me to have a nightcap. I chose the Guinness. It was on top and well, it tasted like Guinness.   The service was good. Ambiance was calm, inviting and romantic. Food was great! The price was extremely reasonable.   I will definitely be back and recommend this place to my fellow business travelers staying at the numerous hotels surrounding this joint.",

    "text": "I ate a pound of prime rib, some mashed sweet potato, and a hefty piece of pecan pie yesterday. Ay dios mio! We came here for the restaurant week menu and left with full bellies and pleasant memories.   For $44 you have your choice of soup or salad, entree and dessert. I had the salad, prime rib, and pecan pie. The salad was your basic salad, but I did enjoy the orange vinaigrette that it came with. I tried some chowder and chili which were both rich and well seasoned. In addition to the prime rib you have your choice of 8 oz filet mignon or seafood gratin. The inner pig in me couldn't resist a full pound of meat so I went with the meatiest, biggest option. I requested the prime rib medium rare and it came out closer to medium but it was still enjoyable and tender. I do think that the best prime rib in town is probably at Durant's but the portions here were amazing. You have your choice of starch or vegetable to go with your meal, I went with the mashed sweet potatoes. They had a light texture and went well with the beef.  Dessert was a sizable slice of pecan pie for me, although there were additional choices of sour cream cheese cake and chocolate cake. The pie was super sweet but the filling was a good consistency and filled with a lot of pecans. The whipped cream on top helped to disperse some of the sugary sweetness of the pie.   Service was excellent. Our server was friendly and drinks and plates were taken away as needed.   Overall it was a very nice experience here and The Stockyards is a great place for your beef-fueled needs.",

We were a table of four for dinner on a Saturday night.  We did have a reservation but it didn't seem necessary.  The waiter did a great job.  We ordered meatloaf, lobster and two steaks.  The food all came out hot and to order. My only complaint....the room was roasting hot.  We were in the bar room and we ended up leaving because all four of us were sweating!  When we left that room the rest of the restaurant was nice and cool, so it wasn't that the air conditioning was out.  It was uncomfortable eating dinner in a room that was certainly warmer than 85 degrees.  I thought maybe I was just warm but all four of us were perspiring and decided to leave.",

First I would like to complement the hostess, Diana, who was able to seat us earlier than out reservation so we could make our event later that evening without rushing through a lovely dinner.  The restaurant was busy the night we were there, but that did not impact our services at all.  Started our meal off with the Wild Boar and Venison sausage which is plenty to share with 2-4 people.  We happened to visit during restaurant week and took advantage of the filet mignon special which was cooked perfectly and so tender.  Salad and accompaniments were all delicious.  Loved the blue cheese dressing.  Our waitress, Meghan and her support staff were exceptional.  Our dinner special included dessert and we selected the chocolate mousse and sour cream cheesecake which we had to take home being already quite satisfied.  Both were delicious and had beautiful presentations within the to go boxes provided to us.  My only regret is that I have not visited this establishment sooner since I have been a resident of the valley for 20 years.  Look forward to going back soon.  Please check out the beautiful bar area when there.",

Chewy to where I had to just stop eating half way thru my meal. Rice was cold. Best thing we had was the smoked trout appetizer.   Service was really really slow and there was about half of the tables empty.   Again for the price. No thanks.",

    "text": "So I went here on a recommendation from a friend of mine who also recommended Durant's. Since this rest was only 5min from my hotel, I went there with my 2 boys after a baseball tournament. Wild boar sausage 10! 4 Jumbo shrimp eh... my two boys had ribeye which had no flavor whatsoever. We had to ask for a sauce to get it down. The parm potatoes had little parm and was more about the look than the taste with way too much cream plus they used wheat flour to bind all the crappy ingredients together to try and make it taste better. Both potato sides were not eaten. I had a 12oz NY strip which I will give a 2 rating. Whoever cooked this piece of meat didn't know what they were doing. It came out \"bloated\" or puffy. That means that it was cooked right from the cooler to the grill to a flash oven of probably 450 degrees... it was the toughest steak I'd ever had in my life. Low and slow guys wins the race. Sever Don, was a 12!! I left a $60 tip on $260 because I didn't want to embarrass my boys who came with me. It was supposed to be a treat but it ended up being a trick... let me also say that I am a private chef in Chicago and I know that I am Critical and bias because of my profession but I had to post something because I tried to speak with a Mgr the next day and was told one was not available... sorry guys. I love giving 5-start reviews but the head chef should no what's going on when he's not there...",

I showed the waiter the bottom of my wine glass was half sediment and he did nothing, didn't even acknowledge it.

Something struck me as different when we entered here we were greeted by a host that greeted us like VIPS and seemed genuine not rushed although other people were coming in. You see the extra care that went into your setting everything is polished till it sparkles. Wait staff is dressed professional and are knowledgeable.  We were started off with complimentary fresh cut vegetables and dip on a very shiny well polished relish tray and piping hot  biscuit's bread muffins that were rich sweet and moist  and soon we received salads (house salad or soup is included) the salad was large and fresh but very mildly seasoned.  My husband had the Wild West Mixed Grill of Elk Medallion, Walleyed Pike, Wild Boar and Venison Sausage that included potato cake ,rice pilaf and vegetables. Everything was prepared well and seasoned mildly.   I had the Walleyed Pike it was lightly pecan dusted and buttered this fish is very mild and rich textured and was also served with fresh vegetables and rice pilaf.  Both meals were large enough to feed two people for us a few things were less than 4 stars but that is due to just not being our style nothing was wrong with anything.  I was impressed with the hospital cleanliest of the Ladies room.  The Stockyards is Dining it is not just going out to eat",

Had I known ahead of time how much they were going to charge I wouldn't have ordered it.  It certainly spoiled my experience there and I will look elsewhere next time I'm out for steak or taking a customer out for a business dinner.",

The sauce they provide with the steak was ~ C+.   Ambience is exactly what you would expect for a former stockyard/pack house, and that is what I like about the place, A on ambience.  Service was an A. My 5 yr old had some chicken nuggets that weren't all the way cooked, and they removed it from the bill (he ended up sharing with his 3 yr old brother, what to expect when it is finger fried food - not the reason you end up going).  Draft beer was good, had the Moose Drool.   Best item of the night was the honey whipped butter that came with the rolls, A+ on that.  OVERALL, same as rating, solid B to B+",

Its also down the street from a brightly lit gentlemens club which doesn't scream classy neighborhood.  But, the food is top notch and the service is very personal and friendly.  I think our server really set this place apart from other great steak houses.  This place is not stuffy at all and that came through in fun and casual staff.  It is very good I will come again.  4 stars only because we were here for a quiet date and this wasn't really that type of place.",

    "text": "The 3 stars reflects the good service more than the food. We went here based on the reviews of the restaurant having great steaks & prime rib. To be honest, we didn't find the steaks or prime rib to be exceptional at all. Very average compared to other steakhouses we've been to all over the country, big chains included. They bring out veggies with ranch dip & warm baking soda rolls while you look at the menu. I was happy about veggies since I'm GF. Salads (house & Caesar) were fine - nothing special. My husband wanted a Cabernet with dinner. The server brought out one for him to try. He didn't like it, so she brought out a second one that he did like. I've not seen that before for a single glass of wine. Very classy. When our food came out me husband's steak was overdone & he had to send it back. My prime rib & my son's steak were cooked fine, so we ate while my husband waited for his dinner. For dessert, the guys shared a piece of pecan pie which they said was very good & I had the cheesecake which was very smooth & creamy. They comped our dessert because of husband's steak. The atmosphere is okay. Kind of an upscale coffee shop almost, but a touch better. I wouldn't return or recommend to anyone. There are better steakhouses in the area.",

    "text": "While I appreciate a good steak occasionally, I don't appreciate $9 baked potatoes.  I'm sorry, but if I'm paying $40 for a piece of meat, is it too much to ask to throw in the potato? This quirk has eliminated a growing number of steakhouses from my list of dining options.  I'm happy to report that Stockyards agrees with me.  Although the area leaves a lot to be desired, I love that this restaurant is rich in Arizona history.  I love the building (check out the bar) and it's Old West charm.  And I love that it's still here after decades of change in the Valley.    The restaurant is quite large with several rooms.  Nice enough to dress up a little, but still comfortable enough for casual attire.  That's \"casual,\" not pajama bottoms and bed head.  This isn't Safeway.  My dining companion and I shared the Chateaubriand for Two (in other words, me and the dude I married ate a big tenderloin).  The steak was really good and perfectly tender.  It was served with the expected Bearnaise (which I didn't care for) and a house steak sauce which was better.  Also included were mashed potatoes, whiskey sweet potato mash, mushrooms, and \"seasonal\" vegetables, in addition to the salad, corn muffins, and biscuits served at the beginning.  A lot of food for $80!  The mashed potatoes were average (but they weren't $9), and the vegetables were a disappointment, consisting of nothing but julienned carrots and some broccoli.  The sweet potato mash was very tasty, however.  Did you know it's possible to eat sweet potatoes without marshmallows?  Crazy, I know.  While I thought some of the food was closer to 3 stars, I can't help but bump it up to 4 given the overall experience.",

The bread included corn bread and biscuits, with sweet whipped butter.  We did not have appetizers but the main dishes and sides were excellent. I had the ribeye, plus seafood chowder (very generous amounts of seafood) and the baked potato with all the toppings. I had not had a baked potato in ages and it was delicious. Hubby had the filet, with sides of chili and beans with chorizo. Our friends had the prime rib.  We were celebrating 2 birthdays and they treated us to 2 delicious desserts. Our server Parker was excellent, very friendly and attentive. The 5th star was earned by her, hands down.  We stayed late and ended on moving to the bar after dinner.

    "text": "So I was very excited to try this place after seeing it got ranked by some clickbait article on Yahoo as one of the best steakhouses in Arizona. Went there for my birthday with my girlfriend and it was one of the worst experiences I've had at a steakhouse, if not the worst. I gave 2 stars because the service was very friendly and the ambience was cool and I can tell they try to put in some effort so don't want to be rude.  The food however was absolutely terrible.  I got a 12 oz New York strip medium rare and my girlfriend got the prime rib medium rare. My steak was tough and rubbery with not even salt or pepper for seasoning. My girlfriend had to send her steak back because it was more medium well than medium rare but even after we got it back it seemed exactly the same and also lacked any flavor. My steak was also charred senseless so it tasted like I was licking the bottom of the grill. Unless you're an old man or woman who prefers their food to be over cooked and unseasoned I would suggest taking your hard earned money elsewhere. Even outback has better steaks than this and for half the price at that. I recently went to the Keg and they restored my faith in steakhouses since I always preferred cooking steaks myself due to being able to buy higher quality meat for less. This place has reminded me why I do that though. Feel like I got totally ripped off with a $100 meal for 2 but guess I learned my lesson about Stockyards. Cool history, shitty food.",

Nice wine pours and then there is the food.  I really didn't need to know about their onion rings. Truly delicious and decadent!   The mushrooms Rockefeller was great and I am sure loaded with calories but eating spinach and mushrooms made me feel slightly less guilty about the steak bites with Bearnaise sauce and garlic bread and onion rings!

We were able to sit in the bar area and enjoyed dinner and drinks there with no wait.  I started with a dirty martini which was very well made.  I ordered the filet, rare, and it came cooked as ordered.  The baked potato and salad that accompanied the entree were both very good. The salad was fresh and crisp.  My coworker ordered the prime rib and he thoroughly enjoyed his meal, as well. This is a very solid dinner option near the Phoenix airport.",

We didn't see him much after that. Other staff took care of the table. We just wanted to eat dinner. The salads were good; my spouse upgraded to Classic Caesar, the waiter said it would be a \"slight\" extra charge. $4.00 is slight at the Stockyards. The 12 oz. Ribeye was good, but not worth $36, I've had better. My spouse ordered the salmon and our friend the walleye. The waiter disappeared for a long time leaving us sitting with empty plates waiting for the check. I'd thought about dessert and coffee, but it took so long for the waiter to come back we didn't order any. It was my Birthday, so it was kind of a special evening for us. Sorry we went to the Stockyards to celebrate. The last time we were there during the summer, the service was excellent. We won't be back, too many good restaurants in Phoenix.",

Did not even offer me another filet. My husband and him we getting into a heated argument because of the way the server spoke to us. We had to find the manager on our own.

I had the petite filet and it was cooked to perfection. I had the berry shortcake for desert - the home made whipped cream and berries were delightful, but the short cake was a bit overdone and dry. Our servers were efficient and met any special requests/allergies with ease,  but did tend to cross the line a bit when making jokes about it. Overall I would come back here when we are in AZ again because the steak was so good.",

Less impressed with dinner.  I make ribs at home occasionally and these tasted as if they'd been reheated from the the lunch shift, or maybe even the previous night. Just not as fresh and good as a place like Houstons or Don&Charlies. Coleslaw and fries were blah. $28.   Other people seemed to enjoy their steaks more and my cup of clam chowder was buttery good, but you can tell the quality control and attention to detail in the kitchen doesnt justify some of the price points.   Still glad I went, just to take in a very historic location.  I'd recommend having a drink here instead.",

    "text": "\"Fine dining\" is not just a setting.  it isn't just good food.  It is many things that add up to an attitude. I have had the opportunity to find it in different cities. I found it the other night at the Stockyards.  We were seated by a host who took us to our table and when we were properly seated gave us menus.  Our server came to the table and introduced herself and said she would return shortly.  It was nice to have a moment to chat before we had to think about ordering.  When she did return,  our glasses were filled-not something we should have  to wait for her to do when the service is right.  She knew the selections on the menu and all available options and could make sensible comments concerning them.  Our salads were served promptly by two additional people and were as fresh as I could ask for.  When my friend was finished with hers they asked if they could take her plate.  I was pleased when they didn't ask me if I was finished with my salad and could they take my plate.  If I'd been finished I could have told them.  We were able to continue our conversation uninterrupted as I finished my salad.  The salad plate was removed  when it was appropriate and we had a few minutes before the entrees were served.  All was in keeping with a relaxed dining.  At no time did I have to think about having drinks refilled, it just happened quietly.  After a few minutes our dinners were served by the two gentlemen and our server appeared to make sure they were to our satisfaction before we started.  There was no room for error there that couldn't be resolved before we started.    My friend had ordered a small steak. My friend is  quite elderly and Kathy, our server, discretely asked her if she'd like it cut for her.  A potato also was served with her dish.  I asked my friend which of the condiments she would like it prepared with.  She look at me and said \"Prepared with?\" She didn't understand what I was getting at but Kathy did and was already reaching for the potato.   She opened the potato and smiled while my friend said a bit of everything.  One doesn't go to a restaurant like the stockyards to have to deal with opening a hot potato and preparing it.   When serving is done properly, these things don't have to be discussed.  Kudos to, Kathy!!!.  That is part of the fine dining experience.  I had a full rack of ribs which were so tender the meat fell of them.  The sauce had spice to it but not so strong the flavor of the meat was concealed.  I also can tell you that unless you are a big eater, half a rack would fill most people.  My friend said, \"Yummy!\"  and I agreed.  I am used to getting a finger bowl for clean up after eating, but I can't complain about the two extra napkins and several ways of cleaning my fingers that accompanied my ribs.    My friend let them know we were celebrating the 17th anniversary of my 39th birthday so they served me a free desert.  I can assure you the pecan pie is a delight!  Warm and laced with brandy, it was perfect way to finish our dinner.  The stockyards, I might mention, is not inexpensive, but what an enjoyable way to spend your money. They do offer two dinner specials you won't find at most other places.  They do have a luncheon menu that has lower prices.   Don't expect chrome and music that is a bit to loud as many of the new places offer.  Instead, just enjoy a time and place where they pamper you as you should be when you go to the Stockyards.  I don't consider the stockyards to be a place you where shorts and Nike's, but of course there are always a few.  I would say a nice shirt and slacks at least.",

    "text": "Went there for dinner last night, on a visit to Phoenix.  My BF had read about it here on Yelp and decided it would be the \"fancy dinner\" for this trip.  There were plenty of casually-dressed patrons, so don't think dressing up is a requirement, tho'.  We arrived a little earlier than our reservation, so hung out in the bar for a bit after checking in with the hostess,  When we returned to the hostess station about 20 minutes later, we were pleased that the gal remembered who we were and sat us immediately.  Our server, Bob, was jovial and very helpful with the menu choices.  Scott had the baseball cut steak (essentially a huge lump of beef -- very very tasty), and opted for the \"Wild West Mix Grill\" - elk, pike and wild boar & venison sausage.  The plate was enormous!  It was the first time I'd ever eaten elk, so I wasn't sure what to expect... I wasn't crazy about the first bite, but it grew on me.  The pike was well cooked and flaky, and the sausage was tasty as well.  I thought the chutney that came with the sausage was a little too strong in flavor, but others might like it.  My dish did not come with the whiskey sweet potato mash, but I wanted to try it so our server brought me a sample of it - YUMMY!  For dessert we shared the warm chocolate brownie with ice cream.  We were both stuffed.  Table service was really good.  My water glass was never empty (one of my personal measurements of a good restaurant).  The waiter was very attentive, but not invasive.  It's not the quietest of restaurant - sound and voices really bounce around in there - but the atmosphere and decor are quite nice, and worth seeing.  Prices were a little high, but it's a high-end restaurant so you'd expect it.  The final tab for two entrees, a couple glasses of wine and dessert were still notably cheaper than a comparable dinner in Las Vegas.  We would definitely consider going again on a future trip to Phoenix.  Tip: even if you're not a drinker, you should go take a look at the bar in the saloon.  It's huge, with really nice carvings,  Looks really Wild West authentic.",

To my surprise when i stepped in through the large copper doors I was amazed. This is a very nice place to eat. It challenges any top tier steakhouse in the phoenix area and in my opinion beats them. The reason is the value of the menu. You get great cornbread and biscuits, a relish plate soup or salad and a side of your choice included in the price. Mastros, Mortons and all the other greats are ala carte, and here its all included, and honestly i felt like i got a better steak. I went with the prime rib dubbed \"best of the west\" and they were right. It was one of if not the best I ever had. My sweetheat had the combo oscar which had a small peice of salmon and a filet. Everything was cooked to perfection, the oscar sauce was delicious..so were the soups and salads. Service was over the top and even though it was my first time there, i felt like a regular. Would I go back...you better believe it.   This place seemed to attract an older crowd, but it was very nice and classy.I can't understand why it  was not more crowed than it was. After eating there i feel obligated to spread the word. This is the best steakhouse in Phoenix. Give it a chance and you will be pleasantly surprised.  Eat up and enjoy!!!",

And I think it was my dad's residual loyalty that brought us back here many times during my formative years. It stands out in my mind how friendly and courteous the staff always was, which, as I know now, isn't always easy when you're dealing with little smartasses like I undoubtedly was as a six year old.  As a grown-up, the two things that strike me about the Stockyards are the quality of the food they serve and the authentic feel of the Old West decor. I think the only negative I can think of is its location: almost too close to the airport. Then again, it makes it a perfect \"celebrate someone is back in town\" by picking them up and making the four minute drive over to chow down on some amazing beef.",

I think the original Cartwrights work here, Hoss was our waiter! The steaks were great, decent wine list; affordable and tasty. The only quirky thing and I'm sure it was a one time thing, but my boss and I each ordered wedge salads, and Hoss came back and told us they were out. Running out of prime rib or 48 oz porterhouse, but a head of lettuce? Great service as well. Will possibly return, but I'll brown bag my head of lettuce.",

A dress shirt and dress pants is about the end point for the dress code.  Excellent place to hold dinner conversation as it's not noisy.  Excellent menu choices. The made a great Filet for me. Even the Baseball Sirloin looks good. This place isn't meant to be a get in/get out eatery. You go here so that you can enjoy a good time with some friends or business associates over dinner.",

However, that was until I tried elk tenderloin at my last visit to the Stockyards. Incredibly flavorful, surprisingly delicate, and just wonderful.  Having been a few times, I can also attest to my affinity for the New York Strip; also incredible! Their cornbread muffins are also crazy good.  While the hostesses are sometimes preoccupied / apathetic, the wait staff is incredibly attentive and courteous. Our glasses never go empty, and they always have recommendations to share if we're on the fence about something on the menu.",

He was very knowledgeable regarding the history of the restaurant and the wine list. He was very attentive all night long.  He made our special evening that much more special.

I learned the building use to be an actual stockyard before it was converted into a restaurant. It's the first steakhouse in the area and given the background information I assumed that the meat would be phenomenal and it was. I ordered a 8oz Filet Mignon, baker potato, as well as a house salad with vinaigrette. Everything was delicious, it just smelled and looked so good that I didn't think to take a photo like I normally do. The meat was tender and juicy, can't go wrong with a baked potato or a salad. I found the wall paintings interesting, I like the semi dim room lighting, it's a place that allows you to have a conversation or a quiet dinner.",

All food at the table that was ordered was well received - we had people who tried the club sandwich and the salmon salad and everyone really loved their meals.   The ambience here is great. It's definitely not trendy and it's more \"old school\" :). Some people told me you only have to come here once...I say you could come here more than that and be just fine!

For the price of the meal your going to pay for here, there are about 4 other steak houses I could recommend for the money and quality.  We were sat in the bar area and they were wrapping up happy hour, it was so noisy and the music was so loud that we couldn't hear each other and we were sitting right next to each other.   I'll give them the fact they do a nice shrimp cocktail but I've had better as far as steaks go. We ended up having to send 2 of the steaks back to the kitchen for a re-cook because they were overcooked.  The potato stack was like mush and the sweet potato mash was watery.  Decided to not stay for dessert since we sat there already for a 2 hours and my head was pounding from how loud it was.  Sorry, wouldn't recommend, wont be back.",

It comes with either a soup/salad - I had their delicious seafood chowder -  as well as a side - I chose their loaded baked potato.  A steak is a steak is a steak, but here at Stockyards, they make a mighty good steak. It's so tender, juicy, and flavorful and that you don't need any sort of condiment to offset the flavor of the meat. It was so good.  Our waiter was great.

Visually great to look at, however, when each dish was plated, cool to the pallet. The amount of steak, for a $90 dinner was maybe five thin slices. UNIMPRESSIVE.

From my experience The Stockyards is exactly what it claims to be a  Historical Prime Grade Steakhouse.   Ive been eating there for years and the food has never let me down, and if something was not as it should the staff bent over backwards to remedy the situation, ie steak temp over and dining with guests and the server offered prime rib at same temp so that I could dine with my guests and threw in desert to boot!  As the resturant goes back to 1947 and my patronage goes back over 30years I can testify to the old school approach to steak that doesnt require foo-foo pitches or explanations of gluten free options! If you are looking for a great meat and potatoes meal with soda biscuts and relish tray and salad or soup to boot, do yourself a favor have lunch or dinner there and try to call me a liar!",

    "text": "I first heard of Stockyards back in the late '90s when I was living in OC.  A co-worker kept raving about it, reminding me over and over to be SURE to hit \"Cattleman's\" for a steak if/when I'm in Phoenix.  Whoops, he had the name wrong, for like 2 years.  I was out here on business at one point and tried to find it.  Not surprisingly, the wrong name made it, uh, impossible to locate.  Fast forward a couple more years, and suddenly I'm a Valley resident.  Somewhere along the line, I'd figured out that the target joint was actually Stockyards, not \"Cattleman's\".  I've had dinner here a handful of times since, and have always enjoyed it immensely.  The beef here is to die for.  Probably the best steak you can find anywhere in the Phoenix area.  Lots of other choices on the menu, but you're really missing out if you don't order steak here.  Lots of side order choices, all of which I've tried I've loved.  Beware the \"calf fries\", they are actually a certain body part that you might not want to eat.  Let's just say that Beavis and Butthead would be amused by the fact that they're on the menu.  The light rail construction along Washington dealt a severe blow to business, and now that it's done, the economy apparently isn't helping either.  All of my recent visits have found the joint sadly semi-empty.  The location is odd.  They could use some sort of marketing boost via the local hotels.  Nobody I've dined with here has ever been the least bit disappointed with either the food or the experience.  Stockyards rates a solid 4.25 stars on the Brak-o-Meter.  It's quite expensive, and that keeps me from giving it the coveted 5-star endorsement, as the value factor is just \"ok\".  But if the stiff tab doesn't deter you, I can virtually assure you that you will find your steak to be top shelf, comparable to any snobby steak joint in the land.  Without the snobbiness.",

In addition to exquisite beef, they had the world's most delicious New England clam chowder, made with a splash of sherry.  We went today, thinking of the delicious chowder and steaks.  What we received as New England clam chowder was a loaded baked potato soup, into which had been dropped a dollop of sherry and one speck of clam.  We told the waiter, and he gave us an explanation about how you have to know the difference between seafood chowder and clam chowder.  (At the end of the meal, when I repeated that it wasn't seafood anything, he said, well, we do have a loaded baked potato soup...) My filet mignon was actually a tough-ish sirloin.  The assistant manager either pretended to be surprised about the steak or truly does not know meats.  She tried to tell me that some filet mignon is tough! We will not be returning!",

The crudites were yummy, however I found the biscuits a bit floury and the jalapeno cornbread nothing too special.   Our waitress was very attentive and gave all kinds of recommendations. I ordered the filet oscar plate, my boyfriend ordered the new york strip and our friend ordered the prime rib. Our food arrived not too long after we ordered and it looked GREAT! The filet oscar was fantastic, however there was no bacon wrapped around it.. but I may be ignorant to what filet oscars are supposed to look like since my only experience is at the Keg. My meal was served with asparagus spears and shredded carrots and french green beans which were room temperature.. still tasty.  The new york strip was excellent and the prime rib looked pretty good.. It was very rare to my friends liking, I didn't care for the texture but apparently he liked it since he pretty much scraped his plate clean.  We had the chocolate mousse for dessert which was ok.. nothing too special.  My only gripe is that it did take a bit for our check to arrive and for our waitress to cash it out. Other then that, no complaints.",

They are always accommodating in securing a large party and have the wait staff to provide more than one server when needed. From start to finish the meal was superb. We started with a Cajun array of shrimp, bread, and rice along with shrimp cocktails, then moved to the main course which I had the half chicken which was cooker to perfection (a host of other restraints seem to over cook the chicken and dry out the meat), had some desert which they offer a great selection to choose from. Also, if it is within your budget you must try the Caymus wine, pairs well with numerous dishes.",

The salad was classic steakhouse.  Could not be better.  The Mushrooms Rockefeller was so so.  I liked the mushrooms and the garlic spinach on the side.  But the spinach and sauce on the mushroom was not doing it for me.    The Parmesan potato stack were essentially really good scalloped potatoes.  Garlicly and creamy all in one, but still presented as a pretty dense cube.    The medium rare prime rib was perfectly cooked.  The horseradish sauce was pungent reminding me of St Elmo's steakhouse in Indianapolis.    This place was Awesome sauce.  I will definitely be back!!",

    "text": "Anyone who doesn't rate this 5 stars doesn't understand steakhouses. In a world full of exotic, overpriced, over the top frilly steakhouses, Stockyard's keeps things the way they should be. Can you go somewhere else and pay more for a steak that may or may not have been blessed by a Japanese Rabbi? Probably. But why would you?  If you appreciate the old school, high quality steakhouse this is the place. Not the least bit pretentious, walking in you will immediately realize that Stockyard's is a True Arizona experience, and pays homage to it's own wild west heritage throughout the restaurant.   Now, let's not misconsTrue this: it's still a damn nice restaurant. What Stockyard's does so well, however, is be True to Arizona in that while the place feels like a special experience, you won't feel out of place whether you are wearing a jacket, your golf outfit or your cowboy boots.   I suppose you aren't reading these reviews to find out if you can wear your boots, so let's talk about the food. I have tried at least 1/2 of the menu, and can't say a single bad thing about it. When they run the baseball cut on special, do NOT pass it up! I am a huge fan of baseball cut steak, and this one is the best there is. I am not a big fan of filet, so if I am going off the regular menu I usually go with the NY or the prime rib if I m feeling like prime rib.  The best thing about Stockyards hands down is the value for the food and service you receive. It's not cheap, so don't expect to walk out with a $20 steak, but for what they do charge you are getting far more for your money than the other allegedly \"esteemed\" steakhouses in town. Your dinner includes fresh veggies and dip as an appetizer, fresh bread (which is superb), a salad, and a starch of your choice on top of your choice of meat. How many places even offer that anymore? And did I mention that their steaks easily rival the more expensive guys in town?   To top it off, their wine and drink selection is top notch. Service has always been excellent, and their servers and bartenders extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  If you are looking to spend some money on a steak, and want the best quality, value and experience for your money, this is the only choice in Phoenix.",

    "text": "I give this place a 2 star based on price vs quality. I have eaten at just about every top steak house in phoenix and I would put this meal on par with an Outback steakhouse at best but almost top steakhouse prices.  $440 for 6 people and one had meatloaf and one had a chicken dish.   The atmosphere is warm and presents a very Arizona flavor to it. I enjoyed the decor. However, we were put in a back room in a corner which I am sure is the overflow room and is not as nice as the front.   The wait staff was very attentive and did a good job. Not a problem there.  My brother and sister in law were in town from Baton Rouge and we wanted to go to a local place of history. We picked this place after we could not get in to Don &Charlie's based on yelp reviews. Yikes, bad call.  3 people had the clam chowder (soup of the day) and it came out cold and sent back which I am sure they microwaved it hot.  4 of us had prime rib and I have had more flavorful at Outback or Charleston's . It was just ok. They do not advertise prime meat but grass fed which can be graded as choice which I assume it is. For the price is should be prime beef.  The mashed potatoes were just average mashed potatoes you can make at home with no thought of enhancing them....garlic cheese, something, etc??  The creamed spinach came out bairly warm. After the clam chowder we did not want to cause any more trouble by sending it back. I just chalked it up to not having the kitchen equipment of the top steak houses to serve pipping hot food.   It is not quite as expensive as Ruths Chris, Mortons, Durants, Capital grill, Donovan's, Mastros, City Hall or Flemings. However, I would suggest spending the extra and having a far superior meal.  The place was just average but at top prices. I will be going back to Flemings when I want quality sizzling hot food and am never dissapointed.  I will not be back.",

My partner and I ordered two very pricey filets (don't mind the price if it's high quality meat and prepared/cooked well). I ordered mine MR it came out very MW and she ordered hers MW (they asked if they could butterfly it and she said ok) and it came out like jerky. She didn't complain, I did and when the second steak came out it was still only medium. I couldn't handle a second wait and just stomached it.

We were treated as well as any of the other diners, the service AMAZING, and the food FANTASTIC.  That experience has led us to return, over and over.  Our last anniversary (our 4th celebrated at the Stockyards) was no exception!  While the new doors aren't as impressive as the old solid copper clad ones (sorry guys!) nothing else has changed.    The service is impeccable.  We have never had less than an amazing experience here and it is all thanks to the staff. I love that we are greeted by name, everyone wishes us a happy anniversary, and everything is always on the ball.  Between that and the food - you'll keep coming back!  The food is just wonderful.  We usually have Prime Rib, but I have enjoyed the Wild West Mixed Grill, which consists of Elk Medallions, Walleyed Pike and Wild Boar Venison Sausage.  All DELICIOUS.  The Steak Soup is fantastic.  I could happily eat it every day for lunch and dinner!  My Prime Rib is always cooked exactly as I order.  The Chocolate Mousse is my personal go-to dessert, and it goes fantastically with the Ice Wine on the menu.  My husband has enjoyed the Sorbet Trio and Sour Cream Cheesecake desserts.  While this place isn't the least expensive meal, it is worth it. I do not recommend bringing children.  This is a fancy, adult place.  Be sure to turn off your ringtones and use your indoor voice - this place deserves it!  My only detraction is the decor, which is dated.  I'd love to see the art be rotated out with some local art - photographs and paintings from local artists in the southwestern theme.  It'd be nice to see the art rotate in and out with the seasons perhaps.  Otherwise, there is nothing bad I can say about this place, and that is more a personal preference anyway.    TL:DR - go here.  Celebrate.  Eat delicious food and enjoy!  You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "Very, very pricey....  The big Rib-eye Steak I got was excellent.  However, my wife had the Elk and she could not finish it as it was mediocre at best and the Creamed Spinach and Rice Pilaf and Bearnaise sauce was edible but not enjoyable. (usually we just LOVE those items but their versions were a disappointment)  Wine is too expensive and the hours of operation are rather short.  I recommend the steak as it is after all what they are known to do best but be prepared to pay a lot for it.  The service was very good and atmosphere nice.  I would go back for the steak but the price is prohibitive when considering the quality of the whole meal.  We will give it another try someday.",

The meat was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. We also ordered the whisky sweet potatoes. These were also very good. I love this restaurant. The next time I'm in Phoenix, I will visit again.

Our waiter was great - very attentive and he made the evening really fun. They even had food to satisfy a picky 4 year old (PB&J)! Good wine selection too.  Within my group we had a variety of apps, steaks, ribs, and prime rib. Everyone walked away very satisfied. I ordered my prime rib medium rare - but next time I'd order a medium - it was really pink - which is unusual. But I was hungry so I ate it all up!  Typical prices for an upscale Phoenix restaurant - the bill for the 12 of us was almost as much as my monthly rent (I wasn't paying).  But we ate good - and drank some really good wine. Too full for dessert tho.   I must comment on the strange location - more of a office building/warehouse neighborhood than where I'd expect an upscale restaurant.  I was surprised that it wasn't busier for a Saturday evening and I am more surprised that more people don't know about the Stockyards for a really good celebration type restaurant.  Well now you know- go eat some steak!",

I had the southwest smoked chicken soup and a bison hot dog. Couldn't resist. The soup was amazing and the hot dog was delicious! My friend ordered the soup and sandwich. She had the Western Dip sandwich and said it was excellent.   We are planning on returning for dinner. I've already downloaded their menu so I can plan ahead.

I was born in Tucson & much of my family lives in Phoenix so we've visited AZ 1000's of times. The Stockyards has been here since 1947! Well, better late than never. Luckily we made it in time to have lunch before they closed for dinner prep. OK, I'll cut to the chase. Everything was delicious! Were we super hungry? Yes! But, the food was really good no matter what! I think we went with the prime rib & rib eye. Each came with excellent mashed potatoes & squash. The BF isn't a fan of squash but he enjoyed this. They were cooked al dente and chopped into very small diced cubes, sauteed with onions probably. We shared a tasty Spinach Salad. Service perfect, bar appreciated, atmosphere clean, classy but not snobby. Prices are typical steakhouse & worth it. Stockyards, where have you been all my life? And can you open in The OC?",

Once we sat down, we were provided with a veggie and bread basket almost immediately. We both ordered a glass of wine, they offer a full bar here. In addition we had the filet and my husband had the prime rib. He enjoyed his prime rib and I enjoyed my steak. As for our sides he did the loaded baked potato which was tasty and I did this potato cake thing? It was gross would not recommend you getting that. Stick with the baked potato or something else. The Caesar salads were an up charge which I did not realize until we got the bill. I guess they include the house salad with the meal. Overall impression, it's a cute place to go to and the meal was overall pretty good. Do not order an appetizer as this whole meal is really filling! Also the Bernaise sauce is included but you have to ask for it as they plate the steak with butter.",

They give an option for several sauces to go with your steak and it's not wonder why you need it. I got the potatoes stacks with my steak since several reviewers mentioned it was great but again, disappointed. Not much flavor and nearly as crisp as I had expected. Barely any crispness on the corners and none elsewhere really. Don't think I would recommend or come back here.",

Service was VERY attentive and the bus boy/waitress must've topped off our water glasses at least a half dozen times. The food was exceptional and worth every penny.  Tip: Order a mug of their craft root beer. It's $5 bucks and there aren't free refills, but is very smooth and will last until the end of your meal.  Tip: The garlic bread appetizer pairs well with ranch dressing.  Tip: The beef soup pairs well with a NY steak and loaded baked potato.  Can't recommend this place enough!",

    "text": "After many years hearing all about Stockyards, my first visit did not disappoint -- Great Experience!  Since personal expectations influence everyone's perception and experience, it's useful to arrive at a new place with an accurate idea of what to expect (i.e., there are a few harsh reviews here that seem, to me, unfair).  Stockyard is a historic, local steakhouse, and its filled with a local, historic decor... old photos, plaques, and antiques.  It's more in the line of Durant's (downtown Phoenix) than Ruth's Chris or The Keg, but with a Western or cowboy-ish flair.  So, sure, you walk in and it feels older, and perhaps, maybe, it would be nice if the carpet was replaced or the ceiling was higher, but, personally, I walked in and thought \"this is gonna be awesome\".    Huge steakhouse booths (we were in #26, both Senator Goldwater and John Wayne's favorite, apparently, as one may scan the entire room), dimly lit rooms, beautiful woodwork in the bar which is separated from the dining area... all the good stuff.  And, Holy-Shmoly, I cannot overstate how exceptional the service is.  The wait staff is truly exceptional, genuinely welcoming and friendly, will share the restaurant's history for newcomers, is very knowledgeable about the menu, cocktails, and wine selection (by the way, they have an EXCELLENT whiskey selection, including some very rare bourbons that I've only had here which are all reasonably priced).  When my ice-water was empty someone immediately filled it; when my plate was empty someone immediately picked it up, but no one ever hovered over us. They really take care of you.  The food was just as we'd hoped it would be, great quality and cooked perfectly. The service could not have been better (THANK YOU, MARK, YOU WERE AWESOME!), and the evening was really quite perfect.    If you're looking for a very formal steakhouse, go to Ruth's Chris or Morton's; if you want a steakhouse that's all about the social scene, go to The Keg or Houston's; if you're looking for Phoenix's authentic steakhouse, then go to Stockyards.",

As you'd expect with a name like \"stockyards,\" the steaks are of premium cut and flavorful. I ordered the crusted fried shrimp and was impressed with the size! Our waiter, Dan, said the shrimp are \"10c\"--whatever that means; they were definitely jumbo. The meals starts with raw veggies and dip along with fresh biscuits and cactus butter....YUM!! Many of the other guests ordered the cocktail shrimp appetizer which looked delicious. Our waiter surprised us with a complimentary dessert for the occasion. My only suggestion is non-alcoholic beverages should be refilled more frequently. For the price, one's glass should never be empty. Reservations suggested for this destination restaurant.",

I had soup to start, chicken and wild rice and it was superb. I had a 12 ounce NY strip which looked more like an 8 ounce strip. It was good but not excellent. The potato stack that I ordered with it was a 3 inch cube and it was mediocre. The asparagus was terrible. It was overgrown and exceedingly tough. I had two glasses of Reisling that were just okay and I had some bland chocolate mousse. This was a group dinner that everyone seemed to enjoy. Considering my steak was $42 and the asparagus was about $12 I expected a very good meal. So my meal and drinks start to finish was just under $100. I was disappointed. Probably the thing I disliked most was that we were celebrating a special occasion and it was so loud that we couldn't even carry on a conversation. So not impressed for the money. Probably won't return.",

Better flavor (less salty etc) than Flemings, durant's, Criss et. al. This is seriously my new favorite. The boar and venison sausage appetizer was phenomenal and a great suggestion by our waiter. The steaks were perfect (always over cooked when we go out, but not here), they believed me when I said rare. The mushroom soup was silly how good it was.  Now it isn't cheap, but for the quality... Well worth it. Appetizer, multiple drinks/wine, and she had a fillet and added a lobster tail/me the ribeye; all for $150? (Plus tip) that is a steal for special occasions. Do yourself a favor.

    "text": "I am always amazed when I find a great..NO! ... An AMAZING steakhouse ! The Stockyards has a rich history and that makes it even more special. Upon arriving at Stockyards, I am a little taken aback about where it is. Here's the deal though, this place started in 1919 as a packing house and eventually grew to a huge feedlot with more than 40,000 head of cattle.  In 1947, the Stockyards Restaurant opened on the feedlots property and was THE place for cattle baron, politicians and bankers to meet. With beef 'homegrown' , fed and plated right on property, the Stockyards Restaurant was THE original Arizona steakhouse. Much of the glory of the cattle days has since gone, but the history in the building still exists.  The bar was bustling and a standing room only when I arrived on a Wednesday night to meet up with a few other people. There are ample premium liquors and an extensive wine list to be enjoyed. We were seated promptly at our reservation time and given an overview of the restaurants history by our great waitress. A small silver terrine of fresh veggies are left for pre-dining munching. Reminds me of old school parental type restaurants. Love that!  Many of the steaks are cut on order and are aged on property. They even have Chateaubriand for two!  I had a 5 oz. filet and it was like slicing warm butter. So thick and amazing flavor! I highly recommend the Parmesan Potato Gratin Stack to go with your choice of meat. I started with the very ample Green Goddess salad and that can be split. Our waitress paired a wonderful Cabernet with my filet; ON her game! For dessert, we all ordered many things and sampled each other's. I personally loved the Burnt Creme .. Rich like a brulee , yet with enough of a citrus finish to not be too, TOO sweet. I paired that with a Frangelico on the rocks and I left, NOT finishing any of one thing I ordered ! I was stuffed! No worries , it was nicely boxed up for the next day :)  I did not find this steakhouse to be pretentious, as some can be, or snooty. People dressed from casual to dressy and no one batted an eye at that. You will need a reservation. The Stockyards was busy from the time I arrived just after 6pm to almost 10pm , when I left.  This is a great steakhouse with amazing food and history and service to go along with great prices for hand cut and seasoned/aged steaks and meats. A awesome dinner for about $50-80 p person with wine .. Best thing, is , it's local!",

I made a reservation on opentable and noted that it was his birthday. This was not ignored, he was greeted with a 'happy birthday!' and given fabulous service all night. We had a wonderful waitress... I can't remember her name (sorry!), but the service was friendly, funny, timely... everything you could ask for. They start you with a basket of delicious cornbread and biscuits paired with honeybutter and a crudite plate with more than your usual veggies (watermelon radish, jicama, etc). Every entree comes with soup or salad, I had the soup which was seafood chowder and was pretty good, packed full of seafood. The husband had the salad, also tasty with a nice balsamic dressing. For mains, I had a filet mignon and the husband had a new york strip... I had the au gratin potato stack thing and he had mashed potatoes. Both steaks were tasty and perfectly cooked. The sides were also great, mine was garlicky and full of flavor, his were perfectly creamy. After dinner, we were so stuffed, but our fantastic waitress brought out a rich chocolatey brownie with ice cream and a candle..... I can't say we didn't eat the whole thing. Thanks to the Stockyards for the delicious and memorable dinner!   PS the whole dinner was under 100$, pretty good!",

Overall, the stockyard is an excellent place to dine with a quiet atmosphere and excellent service.  I expected a better quality steak for $40 and that was enough to drop them from 5 to 4 stars.",

She seated us promptly in a nice comfy booth and we received a breadbasket with crudites to munch on. When our waiter came to take our orders, we informed him we'd be ordering off the Restaurant Week menu and he made this face of dismay and haughty superiority. Apparently Restaurant Week offended our waiter? This is where it went downhill as from here on out, our waiter had an attitude.   As a first course, we had the option of salad or soup. We asked if we could have Caesar dressing on our salad and at first the waiter looked upset that we'd make such a request and looked ready to refuse but relented and said yes. However we found out later that this was an additional charge that he did not mention to us. (Extra $10, really?) The salad was average, nothing to write home about.   For our second course, both of us ordered the prime rib with creamed horseradish, which was disappointing. (Again, when placing our order, the waiter seemed really upset - like we were asking him to butcher the cow and then cook us the meal himself.) The prime rib was average thickness, about half an inch and a rather large portion, but the flavor was lackluster. Even the horseradish, which my husband loves, didn't help.   For dessert, I ordered the chocolate mousse and my husband ordered the cheesecake. I wasn't very impressed with the mousse as it had a citrusy flavor - which was not mentioned on the menu and ruined it for me. (I like my mousse decadent - a deep chocolate flavor. This wasn't.) The cheesecake was good, but my husband would eat any cheesecake.  Then, we waited. And we waited. The waiter had disappeared on us! We waited for a good 20 minutes before we saw him anywhere near our table. My husband had to flag him down and request our bill. Again, the waiter looked like we were asking him to chop down a tree, make both the paper and ink, and then write our receipt in calligraphy. After a few minutes, he came back with our bill and promptly disappeared again. We were shocked to see the extra fee for our salads, as it wasn't explained to us (we would have been fine if it was expressed to us) but unfortunately we couldn't find our waiter. Obviously we couldn't use our credit card (no waiter to process the card) and we had enough cash to pay for the meal plus tip. This is the first time we ever did not want to leave a tip but lucky for this waiter we felt so unwanted that we just dropped our cash and left.  We won't be back.",

When I arrived the front was not attended but it did only take a few minutes to be seated. However apparently if you dine alone the service is lack luster at best.  11 minutes before my sever arrived to take my drink /dinner order. The salad arrived promptly after I ordered it and was good.  The filet arrived and was warm but good. Dan did ask to cut into to make sure it was to my liking.  I appreciated that. The Parmesan potatoes were sickness and piping hot.  And just for those I may give it a second chance.",

    "text": "This steakhouse is timeless. The ambiance was classic 1950's lounge and dining room. I liked all the pictures of the cattle yards of Phoenix from the past.  The prime rib is what they are known for and they didn't disappoint. My Aunt, Cousin, and I all had the dish in different cuts and temps. Each came out perfect. Unfortunately my wife had the trout and it was over cooked and somewhat blah. So just stick to the red meat and you will be satisfied.  Service was top notch. The wine list was decent and price ranges for everyone's tastes. We were celebrating a few birthdays so we got dessert on the house. We all agreed this was a very nice touch. You don't see this at a lot of places anymore except for pancakes at IHOP!  We had the strawberry shortcake and a chocolate brownie with Ice Cream which they recommended. I'd be lying if I said we didn't enjoy it! We made reservations but they werent super busy so we got right in. They seemed to be family and kid friendly. However it is more power lunch than Texas Roadhouse.",

    "text": "An Historical Landmark Steakhouse... had to try for Arizona Restaurant week. I made reservations for 4 on a Saturday night at 7:15. Never having been to this restaurant before, odd location,  very grand in size, decorated with historical photos and art of the history of the building and what it's become.  3 of our party had the restaurant week menu: House Salad, Tenderloin Chili. 2 of the party had the 8 oz. Filet Mignon, I wanted the 12 oz. Prime Rib beef but was told they ran out and had to make a new batch and it wouldn't be ready for 25 minutes, (OK, a Saturday night, 7:30 on AZ restaurant week, you run out of your 1 out of 2 meat offerings???... and you're a Steakhouse). With that said I wasn't going to hold up my dinner guest and make them WAIT 25 minutes, so I settled with the 8 oz. Filet Mignon. Desserts chosen that were part of Restaurant week was the Cheese Cake and Chocolate Mousse. My friend opted to order the Shrimp Cocktail and the 16 oz. NY Strip.  All the salads were fresh, steaks were perfectly cooked, Bearnaise Sauce could use a lot of improvement, potato sides good. Desserts were good. The Shrimp Cocktail was probably the best. The restaurant is Good but not a Wow but they do seem to have a very loyal following. I'm glad I tried this place but that's about it.  Atmosphere: old time Steak house feel, Service: very good, Food: good",

    "text": "Overall the experience was okay. Just as a heads up, if you are running 10-15 minutes late for your reservation, be prepared to be given an end time that you have to meet to sit a table... only to be surrounded by 6 empty tables for the two hours you're there. Our reservation was at 5:30, we arrived 12 minutes past and we were told that because we were late we'd have to leave the table no later than 7:15. So with that, our steaks were burning hot when we received them and I even burnt my mouth.   There is a way to accommodate people running late without guilt tripping them and forcing them out. But at the very least, if you act as if there's no tables because of us being late and then lead us into an empty dining room, don't expect a happy customer.   Also, the steak needed salt and the sweet potatoes were far too sweet. Spend your money elsewhere.   Our waiter was great though and the runners were great. The hostesses were not.",

It is bittersweet that I disclose this, because while Stockyards certainly deserves the recognition, their happy hour is such a finely tuned operation that I'd hate to see it change at all.   Perhaps the out of the way location is what keeps it elusive, there's never an overwhelming crowd at HH, but at the same time, it's never completely dead either.   The bartenders and servers are great, the ambience is historic and unmatched.  The prices are good, and the snack-perks are quite nice.   I've come here a handful of times for lunch, as well, and am sad to say I've never had dinner service.   I look forward to coming back again and again.    Come one, come all, being a friend or a few, but bring only good vibes, and leave with the appreciation that a place as old as this still knows how to do it right.

I love that the bar has an entrance so u don't have to walk thru the restaurant and u can park right outside.  One dilemma, they have Stella and Guinness on tap, so hard to chose one over the other.  Service is great. The bartender has been there forever and is perfectly friendly and professional.  Pass on the wings tho.",

    "text": "It's where old people dine because they've been coming here for years, and they want to bring friends to feel special and maybe perhaps act pretentious... ok that was judgemental of me,  I know.  It's just overpriced, and a bit tacky for my taste.   \"Here's your food, you should find it spectacular because we've been around a long time and people rave about our food!\"   I don't want to be someplace where I have to kiss the a** of the waiter or bartender because they've infused the house reputation into their (absent) ego. Make sense? I hope so.  Visited Saturday at 5:45pm just before the dinner rush.  Seated in the bar, with a narrow window of time to dine before my flight. Gary, the bartender, suggested the \"tips\" (iirc) off the bar starters and he was \"dead on\" with the suggestion. Just right. At $22, I'd consider it premium pricing - but high quality.   My \"house manhattan\" was ok - perhaps shaken instead of stirred (I didn't watch the preparation). What I did appreciate was the timeliness of firing the food order and the quick cocktail service.  Also ordered (and sent back) the Caesar salad - which was limp and tasteless. Perhaps I shouldn't have suggested \"light on the dressing.\" I sure got the feeling this request for a \"replacement salad\" irritated Gary, my seasoned bartender.  The replacement salad was marginally better, not much. In my mind, a $12 plate of Romain needs to be crisp, fresh and refreshing. And what ever happened to anchovies at your pretentious steakhouse? I just don't want the previous days (or week) wilted warm lettuce.   Will I return?  I'm not sure. Do they care if I return? I don't think so.  Front of house gal lacked poise, and composure. She would  have been better suited for Texas Roadhouse perhaps?   Come to think of it, NO, I don't think I would return.  A dining crowd with lower standards will find this restaurant wonderful. But this crowd wants to feel special - and tell their friends where they had dinner perhaps?  If you care about quality food, and want to dine in an unpretentiousness atmosphere...this is not your spot!! I promise!   You can, and should, do better dining someplace else.",

I went on Tuesday night and it was packed, so that's a good sign! Lots of parking & I think there's even valet on the weekends. I snagged an OpenTable reservation so it was super easy to get in. Lots of different areas of the restaurant (it's huge) so it's likely a good place for large groups.  The service was pretty good, they had several people rotating around to keep guests with refills, breads, etc. I liked that! They brought a relish dish with fresh veggies & a chive dip to start as well as a basket of baking soda biscuits & cornbread muffins with a pear/cinnamon sweet butter. YUM!   The server advised all entrees come with a soup or salad too. I ordered a prime rib with a Caesar salad & a twice baked potato (which she advised of a small upcharge). The prime rib was good, not great, because it didn't have much seasoning at all (same with the au jus). The twice baked potato was delicious though! I was full but ordered a chocolate mousse to go without whipped cream (though they put it on anyway).   When my bill came, I noticed I was charged $6 extra for the Caesar salad (WHY?) and $5 extra for the twice baked potato.  IDK why the Caesar was more, but the server never advised of that. She claimed she did, but she only advised of the \"small upcharge for the potato\". I also don't know why the potato is $5 extra when the difference between a baked potato & a twice-baked potato on the side items menu was only $2.  Confusing but seemed like a way to nickel & dime your customers. My bill was $76 for iced tea, steak, caesar upcharge, potato upcharge, & chocolate mousse.   All in all, I had a good meal but had a bit higher expectations given the price points. My experience could have been better with more menu transparency & not being nickel & dimed for everything. The history of this place makes it worth it though!",

The 2nd round was decent but not excellent.  As for the entrees:  The southwest shrimp scampi was the hit of the table. No one was impressed with their steak dishes, the pork or the elk.

    "text": "Had my wife's birthday dinner at Stockyards because they are participating in Restaurant Week, and so I made reservations for she and I and two of our daughters for this past Wednesday evening.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for dinner, and the hostess already had prepared our table.  We wanted to hit their awesome bar for a drink first though, so she told us not to worry, our table would remain ready whenever we were.  Very cool.    We sauntered on down the long hallway.  I love this bar, classic old west design.  Cozy.  There were a fair number of people, but lots of spots open at the bar, and 2 or 3 bartenders.  I ordered our 4 drinks directly from the bar (2 of the same pinot noir, 1 of Cotes du Rhone, 1 virgin mojito).  Inexplicably, it took 20+ minutes for us to get those drinks at which point we sipped for a few minutes and then I cashed out.    As we sauntered back up the long hallway to the hostess stand around 6:30, I was asked if we'd like to transfer our bar tab to the restaurant.  Now, normally, this is not an option anymore, so I really liked that they offered to do that.  We were immediately seated in the Gammage Booth, and then greeted by our server.   He did a fantastic job and was quite informative, friendly and prompt.  Moreover, there was a separate employee doing nothing but monitoring water levels in our glasses, and he kept them pretty much full at all times.  I would say the service was excellent.    It being restaurant week, I had the $44 prixe fixe where I selected the Stockyards Steak Soup, the Gold Coast Seafood Gratin and the Cheesecake.  The steak soup was dense and so, so good.   I savored every spoonful.  They were generous with the steak!  The seafood gratin, replete with lobster, shrimp, and scallops, baked in a garlic cream sauce, and served with garlic toast with side of their Parmesan Potato Stack was quite rich (I love rich food), and was DELICIOUS.   The seafood was all cooked perfectly and tender.  I ate 100% of what was on my plate.  The potato stack was a fan favorite of the evening too.    My wife and one daughter both ordered the Restaurant Week prixe fixe with a salad and petit filet rare / medium rare.  They both said they loved their salads, and that their steaks were perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked.  Our youngest daughter decided to try something new and ordered the American Bison Meatloaf, which I of course had to try.   It was deliciously prepared, perfect consistency, massive portion.  She had never before tried bison and was not previously a huge fan of meatloaf in general, but she raved about this dish.  Kudos Stockyards for getting it right!   Wife ordered cheesecake as her desert and daughter ordered pecan pie.  We took all the deserts home.  Daughter subsequently ate her pecan pie and said it was awesome.  We have not yet had the cheesecakes.    All in all, I was a little disappointed in the wait at the bar, but the rest of the experience more than made up for it.  My wife loved her birthday dinner, and everyone loved their meals.  Love the history behind this place, and will definitely do Stockyards again.",

However, the \"prime\" rib and sides were not at all what I would expect from a \"steakhouse\".   First of all, the regular mashed potatoes were definitely instant box mashed \"potatoes\". Sad for a \"steakhouse\". If you're going to charge 100+ for a meal, don't insult your patrons and at least use real potatoes. The mashed sweet potatoes were watery. The \"prime\" rib was tasteless and chewy. There's was no seasoning at all on the meat and even the horse radish and au jus didn't help.   Was looking forward to a delicious upscale meal but instead got 24hr dinner food. Probably worse.   Could've went to Texas Roadhouse for a better prime rib honestly",

I frequent the higher end steak houses from coast to coast and have to say I have eaten at some great places. This food wise on this night was not one of them. The cream spinach was not good. The mashed sweet potatoes was good, as was the salad and dressing.   Doesn't compare with Ruth's Chris, Sullivan's, Del Monaco's, Morton's and not as good as Longhorn.",

From the point we entered the restaurant we were greeted by the hostess whom immediately wished me a happy birthday. We had a few drinks in the bar. First of all the bar is stunning, bartender was great I believe his name was Harry. Once seated for dinner the experience was personal and intimate. In a dining room completely full this is hard to do but with the superior  professionalism of our waiter John he made it seem easy. I have truly never been that impressed with a waiter as he remained connected with our table the entire time. Even down to the bus boys working in perfect order in the dining room to ensure the optimal experience for all. The food LORD where do I start, we had venice sausage with cranberry and apple chutney, prime rib, bison rib eye, and NY strip ABSOLUTELY cooked to perfection and AMAZING. The clam chowder is simply to die for. The chili is on point. The potato stack a taste buds delight. When you  think it can't  get better along comes the pecan pie and cheescake. From the time you enter to the time you leave the entire staff makes you feel like family. Hands down the best money I have spent on a meal. Deserves more than five copper stars. We were exceedingly pleased and can't wait to return!!! A perfect gem!!!",

It started as a restaurant next to the Phoenix stockyards of years past. The cows are all gone and now a small business park. But the food is still excellent.

Our waiter was really informative since he's a native of Phoenix and knew the history behind this establishment. Check out the the beautiful hand carved Mahogany bar in the saloon. It's pretty amazing that this sits on what use to be the largest cattle auction stockyard in North America. This stockyard would pass 40,000 cattle through here per daily during cattle auctions.  Enough history on with the food.  I made reservations for 7:00 pm and we were seated at a plush leather booth. I really enjoyed the decor here from the stain glass to the large ceiling lamps which contained hanging branding irons.   We were greeted with a relish dish, baking soda biscuits and corn poblano muffins.  The raw veggies were fresh served with ranch dressing and the biscuits and muffins were warm and incredibly delish.  For my main entree I chose the 12 oz prime rib which actually seemed larger and was a thick cut. The entree included soup or salad and a side which is a rarity now a days with all the absurd priced Ala ca rte steak houses. The house salad was solid and the blue cheese dressing delicious. My prime rib was cooked to perfection - medium rare with hot Au Jus and the potato gratin was also delish.  Currently The Stockyard was offering the centennial dinner which was a bargain at $40.00 it included a incredible tasting pear salad, campfire sirloin steak with whiskey peppercorn sauce, grits, cowboy chili made with Chorizo and roasted corn. The dinner included dessert and we went with the warm pecan pie with bourbon flavored whip cream - OMG it was the BOMB!  Overall a great dinning experience with excellent service and quality. I would definitely return here again.",

    "text": "Went in to the restaurant with a group of ten folks. Our service was pretty slow. I ordered a Caesar salad with steak on it. The salad came out overly dressed and soggy, very small in size, and with five small pieces of steak on top. I had to order more lettuce to \"fix\" the salad. The menu was confusing, I thought I was paying $18. for this salad, but instead they charged me $30.00 just for a lunch size salad! WOW! Where do their cows come from? Are they made  of gold? Expensive or what? Would never go back. Oh, by the way, I spoke to the manager about it, and he was defensive, and did not care.",

Ordered medium plus wanting just a little pink in middle. Had pepper corn sauce on the side but didn't use it. Flavor of steak was good on its own. Mine was a little more pink in the middle than I would like. Whipped potatoes were great! Will b back!",

Mashed potatoes tasted like they were instant potatoes. Service was poor and we will not be going back! You can get a better steak from outback or Applebees and save yourself some money. I'm all for paying for a good steak from Ruth Chris, Morton's or Donovan's but the Stockyards is the worst I have ever had! The area isn't safe either. There was a customer whose truck window was broken and items stolen from his vehicle. Stay Away!!!",

    "text": "Awesome steakhouse deserving of the 5 stars for the atmosphere/service and the chateubriand for two.  First, the atmosphere.  If cowboys went to a black tie dinner, they would feel right at home here - formal yet rustic at the same time.  Nice dim lighting, great for a date (my wife agreed).  Service was phenomenal - prompt, courteous, just attentive enough without getting overwhelming.  I am still not sure whether the complimentary veggie plate or the awesome cornbread were on our table when we sat down or if they were brought out later but they were already there when I wanted them at just the right temperature.  Now on to the chateaubriand - to me this is their staple as I have not seen this cut in Arizona yet.  This is basically a large cut of tenderloin, too large for one person, hence offered on a large plate cut for two with different veggies, potatoes and mushrooms.  To me this was the best non-Kobe steak I've head in a long time - tender as a filet mignon but with more meat flavor.  My wife and I were barely able to finish it just because of the sheer amount of food - but it was so amazing that we did.  I've heard that things at this place can be hit or miss, but to me the chateaubriand is an awesome hit, so can't go wrong with this.  Throw in the amazingly attentive service and the nice atmosphere and this is one great steakhouse to visit.",

    "text": "Writing this review breaks my heart.  Multiple generations of my family have come here; my grandfather brought my dad as a young boy when in Phoenix for business in the '30s (with cattle all around back then); all of us kids had our 16th birthday in the Pink Room; my uncle would visit from dry SLC and my dad would treat him to martinis and dinner at Stockyards; it was the place for serious dates, the place we unanimously chose to go for dinner when we were all home, and so many good times.  When Tom and his crew took it over back in the 90s, he essentially left its classics alone. For lunch you could have a burger or orgasmic BBQ beef sandwich to die for; for dinner you could surf and turf and enjoy yourself more than you could at the high rent district places. Oh, the biscuits and  what we called \"crack honey butter\" - one died and went to heaven, it was so good.  Then it closed for renovations - much needed and overdue; the electrical was shaky back then, part of its charm - and everyone I know looked forward to its reopening.  They killed it. The look was the same, but the food.. oh no. My dad was in mourning for months. I tried it again several months later - same thing. Tried it with husband some months after that.. same thing. I was even there in February (2011) after over a year of absence, and if anything, the menu got more trendy and more cutesy and more expensive. So much for my birthday treat to myself. So you see, I want to come back, but they killed the perfection of simpler, tasty, perfectly prepared meals in favor of the rare, the trendy, and the expensive.  Prickly pear butter? Jalapenos in the cornbread? While the steaks are fine, all the cutesy crap on the menu seems to me as if they're trying to attract tourists a la Scottsdale... what a travesty. It's not just an long-time patron and family lamenting the old days; it's the truth.   It can't be explained by being screwed by the light rail line or \"changing tastes.\" It's called they want to attract the business, moneyed and trendy crowds and that's the reason why you'd better bring your platinum card here.  If an edgy, expensive steakhouse is what you're looking for, this is it. If not, go to Morton's for the money.",

Perhaps it was just my dish, or an off night.  The prime rib was a little tasteless and not very tender. The whiskey mashed sweet potatoes were great (and I absolutely plan to try to duplicate them at home) although they needed seasoning. Shrimp cocktail was impressive and yummy, salad course was excellent. I just was not very impressed with that prime rib. If I ever go back, I will try a steak instead.",

    "text": "Wow. I love a well-done happy hour and this steak house has it (pun intended). I had never even heard of this restaurant before some co-workers invited me out for post-office drinks on Friday afternoon. Our office in the \"no man's land\" of 48th St./Washington area, where the only restaurant within a mile has saguaro wearing a pair of sunglasses on its sign. So imagine my surprise when we pulled up to this Durant's-style retro-classy steak house. First of all, the door's are copper, a fact I find amazing due to my new-found love of this material in Arizona. I can't help it, it just always looks perfect out here.  So we headed straight back to the bar area, through the dark wood with brass accents, dimly lit area of the restaurant. The bar is pretty big, several tables and seats along the bar itself - which is just incredible. A huge, ornate, wood carved saloon style behemoth (that puts Prescott Whiskey Row's The Palace to shame even!). In this magical place, Four Peaks 8th Street Ale was just $3. I will repeat that: Three Dollars. And they offered FREE happy hour snacks, and good ones at that. Sliders with condiments and chips and salsa.  Just. Wow. The atmosphere and history makes it a perfect spot for out of towners, the happy hour deals make it great for an everyday pit stop after a crap day at work.",

I'm talking about stained glass panels, a mahogany countertop bar, a 100 year old American flag of when the United States only had 48 states, I'm taking about John Wayne's PERSONAL booth- yes honey! Then we move to the food- the most tender & well seasoned filet mignon & fluffy mashed potatoes, you can't go wrong.  To add the icing to the cake- the sauteed mushrooms- so full of flavor- I could have just eaten that all day!  I thought I couldn't eat another bite, but I just couldn't say \"No\" to the cheesecake! Oh, the strawberry cheesecake is, by far, THE BEST cheesecake I have ever had. It was so rich, moist, & just melted in your mouth. This amazing experience, from start to finish, was courtesy of our server Dan- he is Dan the man! So thoughtful, and full of knowledge of the history of the place, being from Kentucky and all. Just an amazing place to enjoy great food & appreciate some history of Arizona",

Our son had given us a holiday gift of a top-of-the-line steak house. Funny...we were looking for it and passed it right by about 4:10pm. A U-turn and a very slow speed did the trick. However we thought it was out of business. The parking lot was void of cars and not a human was in sight. I decided to call because so many restaurants have closed all over the area. Bingo! They just do happen to open at 5pm. No biggie. We ran an errand and the few moments didn't seem that long. The staff was friendly and the decor was perfect. Our meals were served as ordered. And a great 5stars was awarded because they serve milk....real regular milk for the great coffee after the meal, not the watered down 1%, 2%, skim, fat free stuff. Ugh. The mashed sweet potatoes and the mushroom side were absolutely mouth watering. Be careful of the pecan pie, though. I don't mean taste wise. It was served hellish hot and almost burned my tongue. We always chill our pecan pie. Notwithstanding that hit surprise, it was one of the best we have ever had. We highly recommend the Stockyards. It is a bit overpriced, though. Kudos to our waiter and those who bussed the tables. Our water glass was refilled without our even knowing that. How do they do that? Go...make a reservation and enjoy.",

    "text": "Good restaurant, but just that.    I had a 12 oz. New York Strip as part of a $40 prix fixe meal for Phoenix Restaurant Week.  I started with the steak soup.  Good flavor, plenty of meat in it, but they sure skimped on the portion size.  It was a tiny cup (I'd hope and assume that for the non-Restaurant Week patrons a larger bowl would be on offer).  As for the main course, it was a really good steak, cooked a perfect medium rare per my order, but there was nothing truly special about it.  Seasoned with peppercorn and served with--if I recall (it was pretty forgettable)--a fairly generic barbecue sauce. It was served with a choice of potato.  I opted for the scalloped potatoes and they were really good.  The pecan pie I had for desert tasted good but was crumblier than I'd prefer.  It fell apart after the first couple of bites.  Again, it tasted great, but I've had better pecan pie that held it's form until I'd finished it.    The service here was excellent and the decor was fairly elegant for a steakhouse.  Ultimately, I'd probably eat here again if friends invited me, but I'd likely try to sway them towards somewhere with a more creative menu that perhaps offered a bit more bang for my buck.",

    "text": "I went last night (Mon, Feb 8, 2016) with 2 friends.  They had a large party in the dining room which was quite noisy, so we sat in the saloon area which was far quieter.  The hostess showed me the way to the saloon prior to my guests arriving to ensure I would like that area.    We were served by Henry, the bartender and he was perfectly attentive to our needs. My guests got a porterhouse and the liver.  He enjoyed the porterhouse quite a bit.  She did not finish the liver.   I got the \"famous\" prime rib.  Barely any flavor (although the au jus was decent albeit a little saltier than I prefer), and not tender like I would expect for a $30 \"prime rib\".  It looks like they actually used a lower grade standing rib roast and called it a \"prime\" to justify the higher cost.  I didn't have to saw through it with the steak knife, but found it to be much tougher than better quality meals...    I hate to say it, but I've had much better quality products from Outback.  I see many people rave about their food, but this was a massive fail for my side.   I brought 1/2 of it home, and am not sure if I will eat the rest or feed it to the neighbor's dog.  I will say, $32.00 for a double shot of a medium quality blended scotch (that's the cost of a full bottle) was pretty ridiculous. If it was a higher end single malt it would have been a different story.   On a positive note, their complimentary muffins were enjoyable, and their small relish dish with bottled Ranch dressing a nice appetizer.   Did I mention that Henry gave us really nice service?",

Should have been our first clue. The service was great, the reason for the 2 stars. The food was ok at best, but not equal to the prices charged. We all had steaks and 4 of the 5 were not prepared as asked for. Shrimp cocktail looked great when it was served but was not fresh and had a very fishy smell. $249 before tip and not worth half of that. Once again, the service was actually very good. The steaks were not high quality, have had better at chain restaurants like Outback. Got it out of my system but we will never return. We will stick to Roaring Fork, Ruth's Chris or Don and Charlie's for steaks. Same price, much better steaks.",

    "text": "The Stockyards 5009 E. Washington Phoenix, Arizona  85034  Companion and I arrived at 5:30 to try the menu for Phoenix Restaurant week. While this is created by and supported by the Phoenix Restaurant Association, each restaurant creates its own special menu which has 3 appetizers, 3 main courses, and 3 desserts on it at a prix fixe. The idea is for people to try the food at a special price. Of course, some places provide less than their usual portion size or quality just to get customers in unfortunately.  We were seated immediately as we had a reservation (recommended). Our waiter was extremely nice and friendly. When we found that there was a problem with our table rocking, our waiter arranged for us to go to another table in a different section of a different waiter. This is True customer service. Our new waiter was just as nice and friendly as the first one was.   A basket of warm biscuits and corn bread muffins was brought to the table and was served with honey butter with a drizzle of honey on top of it. The first basket was emptied in short order. I ordered a Beefeater martini, and it was made to perfection with a double olive as I asked for and just a wave of the vermouth bottle over the glass. It was ice cold and really started the meal off nicely. Companion just asked for a Shirley Temple to start with and received it in short order.  Next were the appetizers. I ordered the house salad with honey mustard dressing. I was pleasantly surprised that the dressing coated all the salad and wasn't just drizzled on top. The other surprise was the slices of ripe tomato on the plate instead of the requisite cherry tomato that most places put on their salads. Companion ordered the tomato soup, which was nothing like Campbell's! It almost seemed to be made on a minestrone base and was definitely not something from a local purveyor. While companion felt the soup wasn't what they wanted, I tasted it and found it to be delicious and well made.  At this point, companion decided to order an alcoholic drink that is old time and that is often used as a test of how good a bartender is. A Brandy Alexander was ordered, and other than being presented in the wrong glass, had the proper taste. A touch of nutmeg on top was all that was missing. It should be noted here that the drinks have a full pour in them - no skimping here.  For our main course, we both ordered the prime rib. Mine rare, and companions medium well. I ordered the veggies with mine instead of a starch, and companion ordered a starch. The slabs of beautiful beef came out cooked exactly as we asked for, and the veggies (Pattie pan squash, slivered carrots and baby zucchini) were perfectly cooked. No limp, soggy veggies here. They were delicious, as was of course, the meat. Everything came with the proper accoutrements and was nice and hot.  For dessert, we both ordered the cheesecake with berries. Companion asked for some whisky whipped cream as well and was happily accommodated. The cheesecake was tall, dense, and a large flavorful portion. Doggie bags were brought home, and if the dog touches it he's in trouble!  The restaurant was clean and efficient though just a bit loud. My only ding is the use of serrated knives. With a beautiful cut of beef, one does not need a serrated knife which tears the meat apart. Just a nice sharp knife will do nicely.  5 stars for excellent food, great service, overall cleanliness, and an honest barkeep.",

    "text": "Solid establishment for steaks. I wish they had more dry aged beef options, but oh well. According to my business colleagues, the cut of meat that day was even better than usual. I ordered the ribeye sandwich, cause thats what was highly recommended. For starters, we ordered onion rings. The onion rings have a good batter, a nice crunch, and overall were tasty. You do have to chomp down on the onion or the whole thing will slip away from the batter.   The ribeye was a great cut of meat indeed. Coked medium rare, it had a good flavor and no gristle. I was expecting more of an actual sandwich with two pieces of bread, but one piece was just fine. The bread itself was good, even though there was nothing special about it really. The coleslaw was creamy, but just enough to where it didnt feel drowned. The pickle was a nice touch.   I would have loved to have tried the buffalo ribeye, but maybe another time. I cant help to shake away the idea that the food is supplied by a mass distributor (like sysco or ben e keith) but if they are, they do a good job with what they have.",

    "text": "Solid steakhouse, nothing more--nothing less. Very good service (thank you, Alice) in a comfortable setting. Cocktails were okay, though my Old Fashioned was unremarkable (a little more focus on the muddled fruit than the bourbon, for my taste). Dinner salad was chilled and lettuce and vegetables were fresh. Our party all had steaks: cooked to order and those of us who got 16oz later concluded that 12oz would have sufficed. Steaks had okay flavor, though I thought the prices were a tad in the high side. My side of whipped potatoes came to the table on the low-end of warm, which was disappointing.  Lastly, for a nice restaurant serviced by a professional staff, it's always a minor irritant to see men wearing ball caps and/or sitting in a booth with their legs stretched out and their back to the wall -- it's not a diner or an everything-fried national restaurant chain -- get some class, for cripessakes!  Otherwise, an ok dinner experience.  Cheers! RS",

His knowledge of the history of the restaurant and area was impressive! Of course, we selected the special he recommended, the bison. Perfect! Needless to say, we were relieved to find out the biscuits, cornbread, steak soup, relish tray was EXACTLY the same as it was 40 years ago! WOW! How refreshing! We've been to many expensive, well-known popular steakhouses in Scottsdale, etc., but they all pale in comparison. We can't wait to return, but at our age, we won't wait so long! Thank you!",

    "text": "My husband and I had the pleasure of dining here last night. We arrived a little before our 5:00 dinner reservation and were seated within minutes. The up front staff were very friendly. The restaurant had just opened for the evening and as we entered the dining area it exceeded my expectations. Every table set pristinely, the lighting perfect. Our server came over promptly and almost immediately after taking our drink order our veggie and bread basket arrived. These were delicious. Corn muffins, homemade ranch for the veggies, but we knew not to fill up too much on these. Our server recommends to us the wild boar and venison sausage which my husband couldn't pass up. They were delicious and the cinnamon apple chutney compliments them perfectly. I ordered the filet and my husband got the prime rib. We were both in food heaven. The filet just melted in my mouth, it was perfectly cooked and season and my knife just went right through. My husband loves prime rib and usually orders it whenever he has the opportunity. He said this was the best prime rib of his life.   The service was flawless. We are both sticklers for service and this place delivered the best we've had in quite a while. Every dish or drink hit the table what seemed like immediately after we ordered it. And you would finish and lay your fork down and boom a buser would appear and ask to clear your plate. Go to the restroom and our server would come and fold your napkin up like brand new. Our server was also great when talking about the rich history of the restaurant and explaining the different items on the menu. I would ask for a recommendation and she would respond no hesitation with definitive answers, I like that. It tells me that she knows what she's serving and she feels confident.   We were here for my husbands birthday, it was s great place for this special occasion, I don't think that it is a place for children of any age younger than 14.",

    "text": "We were greeted and seated promptly when we arrived, a little early for our reservation. I have only been here for lunch, and it had been a few years since I my last visit. That was due more to the location than any negative experience: I don't work or live anywhere near the restaurant any more.   The restaurant has that old-time steakhouse feel with servers dressed up and doing their best to take care of you. I would suggest dressing up more than jeans and a t-shirt, but I don't know if it is required for lunch. At lunchtime on a weekday, the place was filled with business people conducting meetings. I suspect the number of lunch meetings contributed to the amount of noise I noticed. In the past, I may have been part of one of those meetings, but not today. This visit was for a quiet lunch meal with my wife for her birthday. She had never been here, but it has been on her \"to do\" list for some time. Since we were driving through Phoenix on the way home, I figured it would be a good time to take her here. The noise was noticeable, but not terrible. Just don't expect silence, especially if you come for weekday-lunch.  My wife ordered the shaved prime rib dip sandwich and said it was one of the best she's had in Phoenix -- she is always looking for good dip sandwiches. I had the beef and cheddar on rye with steak soup to start. The steak soup was something I remembered from my last visit and had to get it again to see if it was as good as I remembered. The best way I can describe it is \"pot roast soup,\" complete with beef, veggies and gravy. I recommend it if you like pot roast.   We both had fries as our side, but they were nothing special. I'm not a big eater of fries anyway and should have probably ordered cole slaw (they also offer mashed potatoes or cottage cheese).   Our service was excellent and everything was handled promptly.",

My son ordered the half chicken and said it was delicious. The 4 steak eaters were quite happy as well.  Unfortunately I don't remember our server's name, but the service was excellent! He was knowledgeable, very friendly and on the ball. My water glass was never even close to empty (which I truly appreciate because I drink a lot of H2O).

    "text": "I'm torn while writing this review. The staff was very professional and friendly during our visit, so I hate to give a low review to good people and a really neat establishment. The CHEF(s) earned this review for the restaurant.  A good friend and I are currently on a mission for the valley's best burger. Lately we have been going to high end steakhouses to see how they measure up. One of his coworkers raved about Stockyards and how they grind their meat after you order the burger. It doesn't get anymore fresh than that. Or so we thought.  I agree it's a little weird to order burgers at dinner time from a steakhouse, but every time we tried to go during lunch it was a holiday. The waiter wasn't too excited about recommending the burgers, but we went ahead with the two burgers **Medium Rare** and added bacon/avocado.  The bread basket was superb, as were the complimentary veggies and ranch. The smoked chicken soup that came with the burger and fries was very good. The Stella's were fresh. But the burgers came well done, and well, well done. It was shocking I must admit, but an easy fix the second time around, right? WRONG. After a maybe 6-8 minute wait, fresh bacon burgers came out. WELL DONE + , again. Grrrrr. Bland meat, no taste, no juice, no grease/moisture.  At this point the manager had apologized multiple times and offered us free beers and burgers which she didn't have to do, so I respected that part of the embarrassment of a meal. Maybe even worse than the fact that the chef cannot cook a burger to order was the meat itself. As we drove away we decided that the patties seemed like they were boiled in water (if that's possible)- which may have explained why they had no redness and they couldn't drip a drop of grease/juice.  They ended up taking care of everything which was nice. Altogether it was a trek into Phoenix that left us very disappointed, embarrassed for the restaurant, and unwilling to come back to take the chance next time for a nicer steak dinner.",

    "text": "This is my go to steakhouse. Been here many of times and always enjoy my time here. This time we came here with a large group. They basically have a large main dining area, a smaller back group which is quieter, and the bar area. Not too many people hang out in the bar area so it's pretty quiet there. Today we got all the tables in the bar area so it was almost like a semi private party.   They start you off with their jalapeno muffins and raw vegetable tray. Everything is so good but I always have to watch myself cause I don't want to fill my self up. Next came their seafood chowder. One of my favorites. It is so good. All I remember is the salmon in there but I know other seafood is in there.   I ordered the 16oz ribeye with a baked potato. The ribeye was cooked perfect. Juicy. Not too much fat and just melt in your mouth meat. I'm an fan as you can tell.   My wife tried the buffalo meatloaf and she really loved it. I stole a bite and it was so tender and smooth. Really liked it with that gravy. She had sweet potato mash and grilled vegetables. The veggies where cooked perfect and tender. It's a really good dish.   To top it off I had the pecan pie. It's was good but I had better. Taking nothing away from this pie. It was really good and not to sweet with a nice flaky crust.   Our service was great. Got our drink orders and always filled out glasses without being asked. We had one person at our table who had there steak cooked a little too much for their liking and they made no fuss about it and brought her another one while continuing to apologize to her.   So I've been here and had multiple ribeye, prime rib, and baby back ribs and it's all really good. The reason I like this place is they give you so much for your money. If you go to those other steakhouse you got to pay for all your sides and appetizer. Here you get a soup or salad and a potato side. Well worth the money. Of course, I'll be back.",

    "text": "This review is for the evening of September 29. I'd like to preface this with I have been to this restaurant on numerous occasions for lunch and dinner. I am well aware of the acoustics in this restaurant. My boyfriend and I were seated right away because we had a reservation. We sat in a corner booth by the kitchen. It took a few minutes for our server to arrive. We made our order of tenderloin chili, prime rib, filet mignon, potato side dishes, sour cream cheesecake and pecan pie. The AZ Restaurant Week menu was exactly what we wanted. After we received our tenderloin chili, a table of eight was seated by the front of the restaurant. As the evening went on, it was clearly obvious that they had no regard for anyone around them. They were so loud that I could hear their conversation. I noticed another table by us with an older couple and she was telling her husband that they were really loud. On my way to the restroom, I stopped by their table and remarked about how loud the other table was at the front of the restaurant. Her husband said they were so loud that he needed to take his hearing aids out! When I got back from the restroom, I told our server about how loud they were and she said yeah, the kitchen staff even said that it was especially loud tonight, more  than usual. She said that people asked to be moved from that area. I looked over and there was no one around them on a Saturday night! I don't understand why the restaurant staff did not say anything to this table. It ruined the experience of other diners around them. The meal was great, but unfortunately the night was overshadowed by the party animals.",

Came for a special occasion with my ex-wife, her daughter, boyfriend and 4 month old granddaughter.  Seated promptly and had a very nice, though overly solicitous waiter.  Just trying too hard, but nice enough.  We had a range of food from my ribeye, MJ's prime rib, Corey's filet and Molly's chicken.  Summer, the grandbaby, scarfed the relish bowl of celery and other wonderful finger food. However, my rib eye was a thin cut, dry and basically tasteless.  I've had better at Black Angus for half the price. At the prices Stockyards charges, it should be a prime cut prepared well.  Not tonight.",

Then we waited a good 45 min for her next steak which was rare NOT medium rare and when she advised him once again that her steak was not cooked the way she wanted he argued with her and eneded with what would you like me to do box it up so you can take it home and cook it to your liking?! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!! And in all this the manager came to our table just to let us know she took it off the check no apology or offer to order her something to hold her over while she waits for her food to be cooked correctly.

My husband had the filet mignon, and I had the prime rib. Both cuts of beef were tender and prepared perfectly. The biscuits and cornbread that come complimentary were delicious, as well as the roasted chicken soup that started my meal.   We finished our meal by sharing a slice of pecan pie. Again, pecan pie is a Texan food but I would have to say this was one of the best versions of pecan pie I have ever eaten.   We walked in on a Thursday evening about 6:30 without reservations and were seated immediately. Entree, one alcoholic beverage plus dessert for each of us was only a little bit over $100.",

I can cook a $9 strip on my Weber and it comes out better than their $38 16 oz strip. Their parking lot is full of rental cars, but there must be better options. Spare your expense account.",

Not because the non-red meat items aren't good but really, why bother?  This place is known for steaks and they deliver.  They also do the old school relish tray (who does that anymore, right?) and a basket of biscuits and corn muffins.  Yum.  Our service was flawless.  And if I were you, I'd catch an after dinner drink in the bar.  Impressive historical tidbits all over the restaurant, and the bar is great too.    I see some people whine about the price.  Yeah, they're pricey but it was well worth it and from what I understand, their lunches are just as amazing and much cheaper. This is way better than any shiny Scottsdale steakhouse any day.  BTW, they actually followed up with me the next day via Twitter and thanked me for my patronage.  How's THAT for good customer service?!",

    "text": "I was in Phoenix around two weeks ago, and the first stop I made along with my husband was to Stockyards Restaurant. This establishment is historical and has been around forty-seven years! A steakhouse rated as one of the 85 best restaurants in Phoenix, I was eager to try it as soon as our plane touched down. It was even mentioned in the in flight magazine as one of the best steakhouses in the United States.  Upon our arrival, we found that Stockyards was located in a more industrial section of the city, not downtown. It had a more formal feel with historical photos of the stockyards on the walls and a saloon, but not in the touristy sense, more somber and dark. Our waiter was attentive and had a great sense of humor. I think he may have been mentioned in other Yelpers' reviews. Now for the food...I had a beef brisket sandwich with many slices of lean meat on it. The meat was smothered in barbecue sauce, which had a flavor I was not wild about. My sandwich was accompanied by a large helping of fries, tasty and crispy. My husband ordered the steak sandwich. When it arrived it was a large juicy steak, but served open-faced. My husband didn't like this. In fact, he requested a another piece of sandwich roll for the top. The steak was ultimatey too chewy to eat in this fashion, and had to be cut in pieces with a knife. In other words, the steak was not very tender. His meal also came with fries. Our waiter had recommended a roast beef and cheddar sandwich that is a Stockyards specialty instead, but my husband did not listen to him!  Overall, I would give Stockyards a solid three stars. It did not quite live up to our expectations, but it was not bad, either. The sandwiches we had at the Oak Creek Brewery in Sedona were way better, however.",

    "text": "I have wanted to go to the Stockyard, but had not previously had the pleasure. I don't want to drive back toward work and try a pricey restaurant that might not be worth the trip. Rachael Ray recommends trying a place for lunch when it is cheaper and less of a wait - so that is what I did today. One area where Rachael's advice was incorrect was the wait - Friday during lunch was very busy. When I entered the host recommended that I go to the bar because the dining area was already full. The bar contains seating as well as seats at the bar itself.  With the available seating taken, I bellied up to the bar at looked over the lunch menu. A positive note is that the menu is the same in the bar as the dining room. Being during work hours I could not enjoy items from the behind the bar, but the guys just down the bar from me were ordering and I was excited to learn the Stockyard has Moose Drool on tap. Instead, I had the diet Pepsi.  When the waitress asked if I was ready and I indicated not yet, I didn't realize that might be my only opportunity. I imagined she would only serve those at the bar; however, she also worked the room behind the bar and was constantly running back and forth. It took about 15-20 minutes, but eventually she returned to take my order. I went with the Grilled New York Strip Steak Sandwich. I don't know if the recession has caused a bread shortage, it is homage to Dr. Atkins or Webster has changed the definition of \"sandwich\", but typically I picture two pieces of bread surrounding the integral ingredient. Last week @ Robbie Fox's I was surprised that a sandwich came open faced. With the Stockyard menu providing a heading of \"Sandwiches\" and the brisket sandwich being called \"Open Faced BBQ Beef Brisket\", I foolishly assumed the other items not named \"Open Faced\" would have two pieces of bread. Not so. The sandwich arrived in about 10 minutes and was served on a single piece of bread with a side order of fries. Hmmm. That said, it was a regular sized steak - and for $15 a descent price. The steak itself was among the best I have ever tried. Tender, juicy and flavorful. The fries were crisp and tasty.   Although I am not a fan of Westerns, the bar had a nice feel. A copper cash register in the back corner with a picture of John Wayne to the waitress' attire and appearance screamed Old West. It had a nice feel. I don't blame the waitress for slow service because she was hustling the entire time. I think management needs to monitor customer flow and if it is busy on a Friday afternoon, there should be a server working that room and letting the bartender focus on  the bar and the libations.   The dinner menu escalates in price, but given what I had for lunch, the history and the atmosphere, I would like to come back and experience dinner in the dining room or maybe spend a quiet evening at the bar enjoying a Moose Drool or two.",

Huge serving of steak spread over a bed of mashed potatoes. The chopped steak was chopped but yet presented as if it were still 1 large patty. The meat was still moist and had good texture.  Dessert - brownie a la mode. The rich, chocolate brownie was made just right. Not burnt that you see at most chain restaurants. The brownie was warm but not hot that it melted the ice cream.  Overall, I'm a fan and would visit here again.",

Pleasant greeting at the door, comfortable seating for me and my guest.  Great menu selections, good food presentation and unobtrusive high class service.  No pressure to turn over the table even though it was a busy night. Only ONE THING MISSING - where are all the single women in the bar area?  By 5:30 this place was packed with men between 30-50  and if I were still single this is where I would head after work!  You have to hunt where there's good huntin' gals!",

Back in his day they did not serve alcohol and he and his racing cronies would bring their own bottles. My first trip here was over 40 years ago when they still had the stockyards next door.  Worst imaginable smell in the world greeted my nostrils when we got out of the car and rushed inside.  Once inside the only aroma was that of sizzling steak.  The stockyards are long gone but the steaks are still there.",

Yeah, right, good luck with that one Anne ol' girl, as I licked the last of the juices off my plate. Onion rings, slaw, pickle...all good but a waste of stomach space compared to the meat. My associates both had the prime rib sandwich and loved it.  The atmosphere is completely old school, and the crowd was mostly men who, from the sounds of the conversation, are in the construction/mining/manufacturing/heavy equipment industries. I can't wait to go back for dinner - maybe take the light rail.",

    "text": "I was here against my will, having been dragged along with 23 other work people, to have a group dinner after a very long flight.  I had wanted to try out Four Peaks Brewing Co. or Camus, since the Yelp reviews were quite good for those two places.  Anyway, I was pretty impressed with the fact that although we had 24 people, and reservations, they were able to seat us immediately. We got a room to ourselves, and dedicated wait staff. The staff was friendly, and attentive.  I admit that I didn't try the appetizers because I could tell there would be a lot of food. I had one of their biscuits, which was fluffy and tasty with the sweetened butter they served it with.   My dirty K.O. martini was tasty, too. They had a crudite plate (raw veggies) that was less than appealing... just some sticks of jicama, carrots, black olives and radishes rolling around in a bowl that looked like a horse trough. The quesadillas they put out looked really good, though, and people enjoyed them. I tried half of a grilled portabello mushroom app, and while tasty, it was grilled a bit too much and was a little tough. Flavor was good, though.  For dinner, I had the half-rack of baby back ribs. They were VERY good. The mashed potatoes weren't that hot anymore, so they had gotten kind of hard on top. I understand it's hard to cook for 24 people, and have the food arrive around the same time, but it seems like they could've waited to slop your potatoes on the plate until before they were going to serve them up. The meat was tender and very tasty on the ribs. I could only eat half of a half. Gave the rest away... if I had a fridge at the hotel, it would've gone with me!  Couldn't even fathom dessert. The food was plenty enough for me!   The ambiance was nice. Would've been better if there weren't smoking allowed in the lounge part of the restaurant. That was the worst part of the experience. Being from California, I\"m not used to having to smell second hand smoke while eating anymore.   It may have been a better experience if we didn't have 24 people... I probably won't get a chance to rate it again. I'd really say that it was about a 3.5, if I'm going to be honest about it. I really did love my ribs and drink and the service was exceptional.",

All we needed were our turtle shells and goggles!  Had it been crowded for the regular lunch crowd, we might not have stayed.  I was thinking this restaurant would be similar to Cattleman's Steakhouse in Oklahoma City.  WRONG.  That being said, the service we received was as if we were dressed in our Sunday best.  It was phenomenal.    We were presented with the lunch menu and I immediately found myself torn between the sliced prime rib with cheddar cheese and the BBQ beef sandwich.  The combo of the cheddar with the prime rib didn't sound too appealing, although our server told us he loves it so much he eats one three times a week (I wouldn't admit to something like that!).  I decided to get the BBQ sandwich to be safe.  My sandwich arrived on a regular sized bun with a huge heaping of meat in it.  I didn't eat the top portion of the bun; only the bottom with the meat on top.  The taste was both tangy and sweet, with just a nice hint of spice.  My sandwich came with an order of skinny fries and a pickle.  It wasn't exactly cheap (9.00), but I didn't have any regrets about ordering it.    I'm still curious about the prime rib sandwich, so I may have to go back for that this week some time.",

We got to the bar (Happy Hour) about 4:15, ordered our refreshments and saw the sliders, the oh so cold sliders. Remembering last years visit we were disappointed. We finished our drinks and sauntered into the dining room. We both ordered the prime rib and after we were served I cut a piece of my cold to the touch $34 prime rib. My brother in laws meat was so tough the steak knife had to be used like a saw. We told the waitress about the cold meat and in as professional a manner as I've ever seen she removed it and apologized. Forward 5 minutes she returns with my second prime rib. I touched the top and it was minimally warmer, although the plate was so hot it couldn't be touched. Cut into this one and again barely warm. I now asked for the chef knowing some line cook had plated my food. Who appears? The owner. I explained my concerns and on the third try received a warmer, still not hot piece of meat. By now the serving and returning had spanned about 20 minutes, I had already finished most of my baked potato and just wanted to leave. So after ordering two end cuts we ended up with inside cuts and more frustration than needed. They knocked off an iced tea and one alcoholic drink. Simply stated, I'll never return. If the meal was free I wouldn't go back just based on the frustration aspect. The front room and owner were extremely professional, but I'm thinking they're cutting corners with the kitchen staff and that's unacceptable.",
