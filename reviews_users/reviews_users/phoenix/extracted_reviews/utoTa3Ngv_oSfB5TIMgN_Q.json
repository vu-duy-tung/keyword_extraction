    "text": "There's not much more I can say about Rula that hasn't already been said. Except, I guess, I can tell you why I like this place. I like it for two glorious words: HAPPY + HOUR.   Yes, those two words matters so much to me. Rula offers 1/2 off all appetizers and discounts on pints. What could be better? I say try the brie, for it comes with an unbelievable apple chutney. If you're looking to split an entree with a friend, opt for the lamb stew - served with a side of soda bread. The stew is hearty and the serving is huge. I've also had the shepherd's pie, which was pretty tasty. Way too large for one person, though.   Also, I discovered that Rula can make ya a Raspberry or Chocolate Guinness. I don't know how either tastes, for I went with a plain (but satisfying) pint. I asked to sample the concoctions, but was told Rula doesn't let people sample liquors. Fair enough.   If I could change one thing about this place (ok, maybe more than one thing), I'd have a larger beer selection - even sold by the bottle. I'd also make it less noisy and crowded at night. If you don't get there early enough to stake your spot, you're likely to be standing the entire time. That doesn't make for a very comfortable experience. Word to wise: take advantage of Rula's casual atmosphere and leave your ridiculously high heels at home.  It's great that Rula offers live music. I wish they offered more. Sure, the outside patio is great, but what if I'm in the mood to play darts? I guess I'll have to go to another bar for that... and for the beer I'm really craving.  WORD TO NON-MEAT EATERS: Try their veggie burger thingy - with mushrooms, peppers and such all heaped between two soft and delicious pieces of bun. Yum. It comes served with fresh, crispy and DIVINE 'tator wedges. These ain't your normal french fries, people. I STILL have cravings for them!  Rula Bula's food deserves 5 stars!",

    "text": "FOOD: After several nights of liberal boozing at Rula Bula, I just ate here for the first time today. The fish and chips are amazing!! Not only is the cod great, but the chips are the best I've ever had. The menu offers other popular Irish courses, too. The beer selection isn't the greatest, but they do have a couple good choices.   PRICE: The dishes are decently priced, but the beer is relatively expensive. A pint was $5.50.   ATMOSPHERE: This place is covered in wood on the inside, giving it that authentic pub ambiance. But at this time of year (spring), you gotta eat outside under an umbrella in the courtyard out back. It doesn't get much better than eating delicious fish and chips, sipping on a pint of brew in warm weather with friends. At night, it can be a fun, lively place to party. On the weekends, not sure which night, they have live bands playing. Cover will be $2 on these nights.   SERVICE: Great staff  SKINNY: Rula Bula is a double threat! I've been having great times at Rula Bula at night, and just had an even better time chowing down during the day. Best fish and chips in Tempe. Decent bar with great atmosphere. I'm making this my fish and chips haven!  Here's to a long life and a merry one. A quick death and an easy one. A pretty girl and an honest one. A cold beer--and another one!",

Corned beef ain't bad either, although it's not particularly lean (yes, I know, it's an Irish restaurant!).  Good for lunch meals (since it's usually not packed at lunch), as long as you plan on not being able to think very clearly for the rest of the day. ; )  Update #1: I asked an Irish friend of mine for his \"take\" on Rula Bula's. I didn't want to lead the Yelp community astray... He says it's the best Irish food in town! So, I guess you can take that to the bank.  Update #2: A friend and I were dining at Rula Bula's when a patron behind us starting choking. I gave the heimlich a whirl, but not having the best upper body strength, stepped aside when the professional help arrived (first a very nice cook and then perhaps a manager?). Anyway, heimlich was successful, and everyone went home safe and sound (after eating the rest of the meal, of course). Hey, that's cool. I like eating at a place that's not afraid to save a life or two... Oh, the meal was good too ~ lamb stew for my friend and corned beef for me. ; )",

    "text": "A friend of mine plays there on Mondays...so we wanted to surprise him and go watch him play.  So I called about 3pm to find out what time he goes on.  Here's how the conversation went:  Me: **ring ring** Rula: This is Steve Me: Hello is the Rula Bula Rula: Yeah Me:  I was just wondering what time Shelby goes on tonight? Rula: I don't even know.  Probably 9, 9:30, 10 Me: Can you get me someone who can find out? Rula: No, there are no managers here. (He hung up at this point)  I don't know about you, but that was not customer service at all.   So I waited an hour, called again.  This time got a girl.  I knew she would be better then the last guy cause she answered the phone...\"Thank you for calling Rula Bula.  How can I help you.\"  Much better then, \"This is steve\".   She told me exactly what time Shelby went on and let me know that they serve food til 10p.  So we got there about 8:30p.  Ordered drinks and food.  Was enjoying ourselves until the server came over and told us she was going to have to close our tab because she was leaving.  That is one of my biggest pet peeves, when I am forced to close my tab cause that person wants to go home.  Why can't my tab just be transfered to someone else?    So we're enjoying music and the bartender comes to clear our glasses and my friend ask her if he could have another stella.  She doesn't say anything and just walks away.  15 mins later we're looking for her to find out about the stella, we make eye contact with her from our table and motion for the stella.  She points to the end of the bar.  Apparently she served it when we ordered it and then just left it at the bar and never said anything to us.    I used to like hanging out at Rula Bula, but it seems that lately it's gotten expensive and the service has gone to shit.  I don't know why they tell you that the pints of beer at $4.50, when they are actually $5.50.  I won't go back anytime soon.  I'll stick to Fibbers and The HatRack Pub.",

The way a good pub should be.  However-my dining experiences and some day experiences in the past have not been great AT ALL. I found the bartenders lacking that extra mile, esp. when there was hardly anyone in there and I was at the bar alone-in a real pub, that is an opportunity to chat a little bit. I don't mean I want to tell them my lifestory, but man...its a bit awkward! Also the veggie burger was lacking and became a mess all over my hands due to some mysterious fucking leaky ass sauce. So I couldn't recommend this place for a long while 'cause everytime I went, it left me disappointed and hollow. It was also the worst poured Guiness I had ever had, too.  BUT-the bartender out back was awesome and it is a good vibe (how hippy does that sound-damn, the west is changing me!), really spacious, huge beers at reasonable prices.",

One-fucking-thousand-three-hundred-and-ninetieth.  And many say that even THAT was a stretch and purportedly done as a favor from his childhood friend and Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda.  But Mike got to the majors and kicked some major ass to become the best slugging catcher ever and a 12-time All Star.  And that is the same story of how our little Irish spot on Tempe's Mill Ave came to the Bigs and started wrecking shop.  A number of years ago, when it started, it was a pretty drab, boring place.  Then they got their shit together, hosted some Irish folk bands, and renovated their backyard.  They started distancing themselves from frat bar to autonomous Irish pub and improved their drinks selection.  Then, they revealed these out-fucking-standing fish and chips combo which slotted them for the All-Stars of little-pub-who-could, underdog perseveres status.   Give me Varitek and his Irish pub up in Beantown, and I'll put Rula up against his without blinking.  Rula is THAT good.",

    "text": "Rula Bula saved my marriage!  Rula Bula also holds the secrets of the Free Masons, is a regular meeting place for the Illuminati, and the Knights Templar once excavated its basement with the goal of finding the Holy Grail.  Okay, now that I have your attention, I can honestly say that only one of those things are True.    The fact of the matter is that I have put off writing a review of Rula Bula for over a year because I have always found it difficult to articulate why I love this place so much.  Anyway, I could put it off no longer, so here it goes:  Many years ago, when I came of drinking age, Rula was one of the first pubs I went to and it has always held a special place in my heart.  Now, do not get me wrong, the reasons that I hold RB in such high regard are not all based upon sentimental nostalgia.  Let us start with the menu.  I am a vegetarian and Rula has always been a safe refuge for me; the vegetarian shepherds pie is phenomenal and their veggie burger is always a safe bet.  Rula also has my favorite dessert in the Valley of the Sun; the Irish Bread Pudding with Vanilla Ice Cream is responsible for an extra five pounds I carry around these days.  Moving on, the ambience of this Irish pub located in the desert is relaxation incarnate.  Okay, let the debate end right here, right now--although Rula Bula's bar and woodwork were constructed in Ireland and shipped to Tempe, this does not make it an authentic Irish pub, and someone arguing either side of that coin is a moron.  Nowhere in the bar, on their menu, or on their website do the owners claim that Rula is an \"authentic\" Irish pub.  RB is 7500 miles from Ireland, so no, it is not going to be exactly like the homeland.  Also, I do not seem to read a lot of reviews of people complaining that Pizzeria Bianco's food and ambience is not authentic, the way it is in Naples; get over it, people.  Beer!  I love that I can get all of my favorite Irish and English beers on tap here.  Live music!  I love their open mic night and basically all the other nights during the week when they have great bands playing.  One last point, they have a great staff of bartenders and servers.  Enjoy!",

It's nowhere close to feel that emanates from Rosie McCaffreys, Casey Moores or Dubliners.   At those places you can't mistake the environs.  I think Omer is right on re: the lighting, ceilings and decor here.  I really like the fish and chips here - especially the quarter inch think round potato chips.   Paired with a pint of Harp, and I was a happy camper.   Service was ok - neither fast nor quick.

I'm still not wowed by the food - baked brie and the chips w/Killarney Sauce are the only two items I will order because they are both really good.   The outdoor patio is awesome. I've always had fast service and even though it does get crowded at night, I never feel super cramped. The only thing I didn't appreciate was before an ASU football game a few months ago, I wasn't allowed to order two drinks at the outdoor bar because they were both going to be for me. Apparently that wasn't allowed - lame. Indoors is still a lot of fun especially due to the live music. Bar service inside is fast for me, but that's probably because some of the bartenders recognize me from how much I frequent Rula Bula.  I'm bumping Rula Bula up to four stars because I always have a good time drinking there with my husband and friends. Plus we always meet interesting people and have fun stories when we leave. Go for the drinking and music, not for the food.",

The food is always there- and it's surprisingly good Pub fare, but what this place sells most successfully is soulful ambience, a down-to-earth yet diverse  crowd, interesting live music, a gorgeous patio, and a cool-as-hell waitstaff. That's the hook.  It's the kind of place where women get up and dance to live music because they're actually moved to \"get down\". Not that there isn't a little frontin' and narcissistic booty-shaking going on, but it feels very balanced and chill, because everyone else is either lounging in beat-up  wooden booths, hanging out in a laid back fashion on the patio, or tucked away in an intimate corner somewhere.  It's also a place where alot of people pass through on their way to somewhere else for the evening, and is nestled against an upscale hotel- so if you're into people watching, there are always fresh faces. The staff is very cool and keeps things on the upbeat overall. It's a great time, and cool place to meet other cool people. .",

We got there about 3:30 in the afternoon, we started to walk through the door and the employee at the door says its $5.00 cover for each of us. I said, we came to eat, his response, I don't care. The cover is $5.00.   I mentioned that I had called earlier and asked about bringing my 16 year old daughter down, and was him there was no problem.  Someone came out, claiming to be a manager and let us in to eat. Of course, I still had to pay $10 for the pleasure of walking through the door.   The food was really bad, it was just thrown together. I get it, it's a drinking holiday, it was busy, the food came quick, but it was a mess. And, served on a paper plate, with a plastic knife and fork.  Lesson learned, never returning on Saint Patrick's day.   I just called and talked to a manager named Brandon, his professionalism and apology has inspired me to add an additional star. I was offered to come in again and he would take care of my meal, I declined.  The guy at the door, could do well with some serious customer service training. He was not very welcoming at all.",

The Buffalo Wings were BOMB! Did I mention that the Chips were off the hook! Feed me potato's!!!!  Downside:  The waiter was way chatty...and a little irritating.

I asked him to give me another selection and he clearly stated, \"My manager won't let me take it back I need to charge you for it.\" I was in shock...I couldn't believe it so I started laughing.  At that point I told him to bring me a bottle of what my GF was drinking since it was way better and forget about the whole nasty glass of wine. It's all in the delivery of the message dude...I don't care if you charge me for it. At least go and pretend to talk to your manager then tell me you can't. Duh, It's called customer service. You know the line of work your in....Just Sayin!",

I recommend getting the side of Brussels sprouts - they are tender and flavorful. Their Guinness pour is True perfection and includes a cool shamrock stamp in the foam. If the weather is nice, definitely opt to sit on the patio.",

When we sat down, it took what seemed like forever for our waitress to finally greet us and take our drink order. However, once we got rolling she was fairly attentive. My problem with this place is the bartenders. My friend ordered two different martinis that were so horribly made that she sent both of them back. I ordered 3 vodka sodas in an hour ($6 a pop on well) and left there stone cold sober. They were almost certainly 100% soda water with a lime.  I tipped my waitress well, but left her a note advising her not to tip her bartenders.",

It's at a great location right on Mill Avenue, and we sat up at the bar for a late lunch.  Originally just planning on catching up over a Guinness, we decided to check out the lunch menu and I ended up ordering a pretty delicious burger. The Irish chips that accompanied the burger were a great break from normal French fries; a couple dashes of malt vinegar made them perfect. I'd highly recommend giving them a shot if you haven't tried them before.  Rain started pouring as a monsoon swept through Tempe during lunchtime, and the weather just happened to complement the Irish decor perfectly. We ended up striking up a conversation with the bartender and found out that he grew up in a neighborhood next to mine back in California. He even ended up showing us a few of his bartending tricks. Great guy, great food, and a great experience.",

We drove up for brunch, I got Rula's Big Breakfast which was excellent!  The French toast was thick and moist and the Tullamore Dew dipping sauce it's served with is very tasty!  The fried chicken was also good but not really anything to rant about.  Their home fries on the other hand are absolutely worth the trip themselves (these are the chips served with the fish & chips).  My wife ordered the fish & chips and they came out crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, definitely a contender for best fish & chips.  This would normally warrant a 5 star rating from me, however a month later we visited again and both got the fish & chips, and while the chips were still just as spectacular, the fish wasn't the same.  The batter seemed thin and lacked the crispiness that the first time around had.  The food was still good, but it was just disappointing after having such an outstanding experience the first visit.  We plan to go again a third time in the near future and I'll update my rating depending on that trip.",

The majority of this crowd is the plastic hat wearing, acoustic guitar maiming, frat boy we've all come to know and love OR the skinny jean squeezing, ironic mustache wearing hipster.  But my grand pappie always said \"It takes all types to keep us spinning\" so I keep going back.  Why? The food (by and large) is awesome.  Don't get the bangers and mash unless you don't mind kind of mushy bangers (i prefer mine with a bit more snap).  Shepherd's pie, Boxty, and a few other items I've had are great. Beer is good, good with food, I ate and drank so much I almost pooed.  Yeah, they have beer.  So don't a lot of places.  The back patio is great if you are a smoker (I am).  The music out there is hit or miss but the bar tenders, bussers and a few regulars back there are worth it.  Live music on occasion is alright and the trivia night was really fun the night I went.",

Truthfully, the saddle shop is a good looking bar.   Anyway, got the beef and Guinness pie (about $15) -- more of a stew with big chunks of beef with a French roll-looking piece of puff pastry laid on top. It tasted much better after shredding up the meat and mixing in some mashed potato.   My boyfriend got the shepherd's pie lunch special (about $8). While his entree was decent, he got salad as a side, which he said was very heavy on the vinegar.   Overall, the food and service were decent, but the prices were fairly high for these traditional dishes. It's worth stopping by for a beer at least once.",

    "text": "Ah, this is good stuff!  First off, they have free two-hour parking behind the joint, so plan your trip carefully.  Second, enjoy!  I'm a former native and I'm back in town with a friend who is also a former local, and he tells me there's this great fish 'n' chips place in Tempe, but he couldn't find it over the weekend.  So yesterday we're out and about and were going to go to Ted's, THE BEST PLACE in town for hotdogs, when we decided to look for this place.  Dave remembered something close to the name and it was close enough, and here we ended up.  Decor: very nice.  I can't say it struck me as authentic Irish so much as old American antiquish, but that's OK.  Drinks: I had iced tea, which was fine.  Dave had a whiskey which apparently he quite liked.  Food: very good.  We both had fish and chips, and we both liked it.  I was ambivalent about the \"Irish\" potatoes, as they simply seemed sliced at about a quarter inch and pan fried, but they were OK.  The fish was very good, nicely golden brown, and the tartar sauce was sufficient in quantity.  The coleslaw didn't do anything for me, but Dave finished his.  But what's going to bring me back is the rest of the menu.  I like George and Dragon in Phoenix, but I prefer to go there with either my wife or my oldest friend, and neither are in town, I don't like going there alone.  Thursday Dave and I and another friend are going to a movie at the Valley Art, and I'll get a chance to go a bit further afield on the menu, something that I'm really looking forward to.  And I heartily recommend the Hot Bollix Spicy Potato Balls as an appetizer.  They're quite yummy, they also have a little bit of heat, so if you're sensitive to heat bite in to one first before dipping in the buffalo sauce.  One complaint: for a Monday post-lunch meal, they were really slow getting our meals out to us.  They were less than a quarter full in the dining room and I'm sure had a few out on the back patio, I'm not sure why it took so long.  It wasn't a problem as Dave and I weren't on a schedule and were just gabbing, still, it was a little strange.  I'll definitely bring my wife here when we're in town together.",

Looking for a bar with people drinking themselves to the point of having a good time  3. Want to participate in events like trivia night   Rula Bula is a good time. But you have to go into it expecting to walk into a bar atmosphere hiding behind a restaurant. The patio is fun and there's plenty of room to sit. The food is decent and True to Irish dining. But I really don't think people go for the food. Every time I've gone, food has been an after-thought.   Be prepared to stand and wait for a seat if you're visiting after a festival or game. Rula Bula is practically the first stop after the light rail and Tempe Town Lake so it's a hot commodity! So my advice is to stick to Rula Bula if you've had some cocktails and won't mind the pub feel!",

    "text": "A little back story: I'm from AZ, but went out-of-state for college. Somehow, I was able to graduate in 4 yrs, while most of my friends who stayed home were on the 5 to 5 1/2 year plan. Well, this meant when I moved back to AZ after graduation I got to relive my last year of college all over again (this was fun at times, but not so much at other times since I had a job), and at the time I really enjoyed Rula Bula. Compared to some of the other bars on Mill, this ones seems to attract a less douchey crowd and shockingly what appears to be more a slightly more mature group of ASU students (there is such a thing!).   Even after outgrowing the Mill scene, this was one of the few bars along the street I would still occasionally go to. Over this past Christmas weekend when I was in town visiting I came here with a group of friends and a good time was had by all!!! There's nothing about this place that particularly stands out. We had a super cooperative waitress on this last visit who had no problem keeping track of individual tabs and kept the drinks flowing (everything from long islands to car bombs!).  There's both an indoor and outdoor bar w/patio and both bars have multiple bar tenders so things move quickly.   I've never had the food here, but I've heard from people who have that's it's good. The bouncers are nice as well (it didn't happen this last time, and I'm not sure if they do anymore, but if I remember correctly in the past they do charge a small cover occasionally when there's live music). Not that it's a big deal for me, but the bathrooms are not the cleanest. Ladies, if your bathroom looks the same, sorry.",

    "text": "Irish Pubs.  I probably don't give them a second thought for about 363 days out of the year.  Granted that's likely in part because I don't have any trace of Irish ancestry that I can discern, but that's also partly because (1) I'm not a heavy drinker and (2) traditional Irish food has always been kinda meh to me.  That said, you can certainly count me as one of the multitudes of people who've passed through Rula Bula's doors at least once.  Before tonight's lovely International Supper Club UYE event (special thanks to Monica O for organizing it), my last stop at Rula Bula was at about 5 years ago on a sweltering August Saturday night amongst hoards of ASU students (long story).  This time, a weeknight dinner under the stars with ASU students thankfully on Spring Break.  It's been a while since I've tried Rula Bula's menu, so tonight it was time to rediscover one of the valley's longest standing Irish establishments.  Set in one of Tempe's oldest buildings (the more than century old Andre Building on Mill Avenue), Rula Bula has been a fixture for locals, tourists, and ASU students for decades.  The name Rula Bula translates to \"uproar and commotion\" in Irish Gaelic and the name fits the product quite accurately.  The interior has the feel of a quintessential old world pub with a relatively limited amount of seating and a small corner used for live music alongside the obligatory bar.  The patio out back has a bar of its own with some extra seating (though they often remove some of the tables and chairs from the patio to pack in more patrons during super busy nights).  You could be perfectly comfortable here during happy hour or during dinner hours most nights.  On weekend nights, however, the place will get raucous with big crowds and live music to boot.  I've had the corned beef and cabbage as well as the bangers and mash here before.  Tonight it was time to go outside the box.  Or perhaps I should say inside the box.  Okay forget that word salad, I ordered the Boxty.  Never heard of it?  Neither had I until I read the menu.  Basically a potato crepe stuffed with braised beef cooked down in...well Guinness of course.  Also got a side of Rula Bula fries (basically shoestring fries with a little extra spice).  To wash it all down, I went with a Guinness Blonde (not a fan of the old school Guinness so this was the compromise).  Total cost for the food, drink, tax and tip came to about $27.  For the record the Guinness Blonde was fine.  Harp remains my favorite Irish brew, but Guinness Blonde is a perfectly passable and relatively light lager.  The boxty was a fairly decent portion and the braised beef was excellent.  The beer flavor was evident, but complimented the meat juices rather than overpowered it.  The crepe itself was something of an afterthought which was surprising since supposedly the traditional boxty is really all about the potatoes.  The fries were a pretty good pairing and soaked up the meat juices pretty well, though I'd probably go with the whipped potatoes as a pairing the next go around.  As with other trips I've had to Rula Bula I would pretty much rate the overall experience as okay.  Not great, not terrible, just okay.  The food was okay, the service was on the slow (but friendly) side, and the prices might be just a tad steep both for the food and beverage.  I suppose your outlook on Rula Bula and Irish Pubs in general probably just depend on your expectations.  If you're here to ham it up with your friends or the other patrons with a beer in hand, then you'll probably feel right at home.  If you're looking for a solid sit down restaurant experience, you might be disappointed on some fronts.  If you're looking for a St. Patrick's Day option, I will say from experience that Rula Bula is a fun place to be on St Patty's Day with great music and great vibes.  I may not frequent Irish Pubs often, but I can confidently say that Rula Bula is up there with the best you'll find in the valley.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, my experience at Rula Bula was not very good.  I came here with a large group, about 15 of us for dinner.  We were at a conference at the Tempe Mission Palms Hotel next door.  Rula Bula was very convenient to the hotel.    The coordinator of the dinner made a reservation, and the restaurant was able to accommodate our group and one or two other large groups.  So, space was not a problem.  As happens many times with big groups, service is challenging.  Things started off fine with water being served and drink orders.  The difficulty began when the drinks were delivered.  The server could not remember who ordered what.  We had to do a lot of reminding about out orders.  This persisted throughout the meal.  I ordered the corned beef and cabbage - a traditional Irish staple that should have been really good.  It wasn't.  The meal came with a modest amount of corned beef and cabbage.  Most of the plate was take up by boiled potatoes and carrots.  The veggies tasted ok, but there were a lot of them.  The corned beef was not anything special.  In fact, it was clear that it had been reheated because there were some dry burnt pieces.  There was very little cabbage in my serving.  The cabbage that was there was mediocre at best.  Corned beef and cabbage is one of my favorite meals.  What I got at Rula Bula was a big disappointment for me.   Others in my group said their meals were ok.  The delivery of the meals was an issue too because the person sitting next to me received her meal a good 15 minutes after I received my meal.    Positives were that the restaurant was willing to give all of us separate checks, and the server was very friendly.  Too bad the food and delivery did not measure up.",

It was just blaring and hard to hold a conversation.  I ordered the Fish and Chips. These were wonderful. The fish wasn't greasy or falling apart. The chips are bite-sized potato circles. That's the best way to describe them.  My co-worker got her typical order of salmon and she said it is always delicious. My other co-worker got mac and cheese with jalapenos. The jalapenos were not included so that was a bummer.  Great beer selections here as well from domestic to craft.  Would definitely come here again.",

Loved our server, who is a fan of the restaurant and engaged to one of the cooks. Everyone loved their wine, and the prices are reasonable event at happy hour. Everyone also loved the spinach artichoke dip which was NOT run of the mill at all. Our server was able to get cucumber slices for the GF contingent, and was so nice nice about the ask!  My son said the fish and chips was the best he has had anywhere. He's a teenager, and after the two piece dinner, he was too full for dessert. My friend's kale quinoa salad was amazing (she reluctantly shared a bite with me). The Dublin Irish Cheddar garlic dressing on my wedge salad was so incredible, I asked to buy some to take home.  The Rule Bula Irish Coffee was such a great dessert on a January evening, especially poured over the vanilla ice cream that came with my friend's delicious apple cobbler.  Looking forward to taking my other son to try the fish and chips and to just enjoy another evening on the patio!",

The staff are real friendly, the manager is knowledgeable  on transactions, their products and is very helpful. Had an incident once where I had trouble with the way my debit card was setup. Immediately I was helped by the manager then next day when i called it in, since my bank is of no help.lol.  Anyways, overall finger food is fairly good, drinks are from.bottom to top shelf, environment and entertainment is soo kick back. Rula Bula, my go-to place.",

    "text": "\"The mouth of a perfectly happy man is filled with beer.\"  Egyptian Proverb.   Does this quote apply to those who drink Snake Bites?  Anywho!  Met up with some of my favorite Yelpers for a belated St. Paddy's Day lunch and it was great!  Rula Bula's is a cute little pub with fun Irish tunes and some delicious eats.  Their patio was looking pretty tempting on this beautiful Friday and the first day of Spring but we dined indoors.  To start things off, Gillian ordered and shared her Hot Bollix Spicy Potato Balls with us.  Thanks for sharing those heavy balls with us, girly!  I had assumed that the spice would be present inside the deep-fried cheesy potato balls but the spice came from the hot sauce served on the side.  It was kind of nice since weaklings like me can adjust accordingly.  I had a picture but I stupidly deleted it before I posted it.  Gah!  As for my entree, I ordered the Shepherd's Pie with my side of brussel sprouts with apples.  It was delicious, buttery, and worth the calories.  The brussel sprouts were cooked to tender perfection and I loved the bite from the apples.  I actually didn't know the brussel sprouts came with apples until I bit into one.  Yum!  That tartness really helped cut through all that richness from the potatoes and meat.  I would definitely order this again!  \"For each petal on the shamrock this brings a wish your way. Good health, good luck, and happiness for today and every day.\"  Thanks for a great lunch!",

Decoration around the bar, gives a super cozy sensation of an Irish bar (wooden floors, wall decorations)  Occasional days of the week, they also have live music. Super fun!  Guinness on draft and lot of traditional dishes. Seriously mind blown with everything I have tried so far. (For vegetarians out there, they also have meals for you)  Outside patio is very spacious plus, if want, you can smoke cigars (if you are into that).  In general, great experience with great friendly staff.  Worth the visit! Good luck! Enjoy!",

Just a lot cleaner, because, it is newer. Even down to the Lace curtains.  The food was good, really good. Very True to Irish Food. Not something that everyone likes. But, since I grew up with the Ish food. I like it. Our service was good, Everything was hot (food) which is another plus.  They do offer Free wifi, which I did not use, but if you needed it....... After dinner we sat outside on the enclosed patio area. To listen to live music which was also nice. They allow smoking on the patio. If you are into that. I would absolutely go back to eat again.",

No flashing lights, no 400 pound bouncers with angry stares, and no promotional cards being shoved in my face from down the street.  I walked in and liked what I saw. It has an old school feel to it. There was a live band doing some Lady Gaga covers, and it sounded like karaoke. I wasn't impressed, so I ordered my Jameson (reasonably priced) and walked out to the patio.  It was a good patio, with a DJ in the corner. It had a different feel to it, and I appreciate how laid back it was. But it felt like something was missing. I waltzed back inside, admired a much better cover (of Micheal Jackson) and realized the one thing I couldn't find here.   FUN.  To a west-sider like myself, Tempe is the Mecca of mischief, a place where I can have one too many and stumble back home with a story to tell. There was a dance floor, but no one was dancing. There were tons of people, but every group kept to themselves. Even though I don't go to bars to meet women, there was a suspicious lack of pretty ones in here. It's like everyone who was too old or uncool to go elsewhere came to have a Guinness in peace.  I came here expecting a fun bar that wasn't a full-blown club, and instead of getting a happy medium I ended up with a boring dive. Don't get me wrong, I fucking LOVE dive bars, but I don't go to Mill Ave for them. Rula is a good place with good history. I can't hate on it. I love the interior, and I could see myself coming back during the day. It's just not worth going out of my way on a Saturday night.",

The professional thing to do would be to let them finish the show and then not ask them back if you didn't like them.  But no, that would be too tactful and nice for Rula Bula.

Their other beer selections are awesome and are reasonably priced. The outdoor patio is perfect for night life and on weekends they have live music!",

I was a nice evening out so we opted to sit outside. The patio feels very private, surrounded by trees and decorated with strings of lights above.   The service was excellent and very attentive. I ordered the Vegetarian Shepherd's Pie while my friend ordered the Strawberry Salad with Chicken (each was about $18 after tip). I was thrilled with my meal and had more then enough for leftovers.   My only complaint was that there was a group of guys who were seated next to us half way through our meal. The group ordered cigars  and the smoke was blowing over to our table. If I hadn't already been served I would have asked to been moved as there was many other available tables.   Overall this was a great place to get away from the louder mill dining scene.",

Definitely the kind of place you could come alone and not feel lonely.  Drinks during happy hour are $3 for a pint, or $1 off 20 oz drafts, wells, and house wine. After HH, drinks can get a little pricier. Foodwise, $8 got us  sliders, sweet potato fries with a tasty spicy ketchup, and the Hot Bollix Spicy Potato Balls- deep fried mashed potatoes with bacon, scallions, and Irish cheddar. How can you not like fried balls of potatoes and cheese?  I will cheers to that!",

Maybe its because its on Mill, but I never see this as the kind of place I could hang out for more than an evening once every few months.

We had a double birthday which drew out about 25 of us.  We were seated, served and managed by two very capable servers.  This isn't why I'm writing the review though.  Like most \"Iron Druid\" fans I associate Rula Bula with Fish & Chips which is what I always order here, but last night my boyfriend and a few others ordered the \"Comfort Food\".  Good Gravy!  This was amazing and now I can't imagine trying anything else.  Do you like Mac & Cheese? Do you like fried chicken? Bacon? Brown Gravy? Do yourself a favor and make the trip to Downtown Tempe.",

We waited briefly for a table, but then sat at that table for at least 15 minutes before being greeted by a server who wasn't even supposed to be ours. Tyler, our server, was outstanding. Otherwise, this whole lunch experience was awful. We waited 45 minutes for food when finally we asked to speak to a manager. The manager, Kevin, came over, finally, with our food. We expressed our frustration with the eye rolling and the 45 minute wait for food. He blamed the new hostess saying, \"She flooded the restaurant with tables.\" And, \" She doesn't know how to deal with stress.\" Next he offered us a free round or dessert. We declined as our one beer lunch had morphed into a 2 beer lunch already because of the wait. Kevin was sarcastic and condescending, and I almost died when he blamed the 19 or 20 year old hostess for all of the problems. When Kevin left our table, after not apologizing, we began eating and then realized our food was ice cold. I sent back the potato skins I ordered and asked Tyler to nuke my soup. When we received the bill, we were quite shocked to see nothing beside the skins I had sent back was removed from our bill. We paid our bill and way overtipped Tyler because he was great. At the end of our lunch, a random server had the audacity to come over to our table and sarcastically say, \" You ladies should come on A Monday. It's a lot less busy.\" As if complaining about waiting for 45 minutes is okay in any situation. This place is a mess and we will lot be returning. Terrible.",

Friday (12/7/18) we stopped off for dinner after visiting the Desert Botanical Gardens. Paid by credit card for the meal, tip was in cash (over 20%).  The charge that showed up on my credit card was not the charge I totaled on the bill. They had added 20% on top of the cash I left with the bill. That's double tip dipping.  These situations can usually be resolved with a credit card dispute. But really, why should the customer be inconvenienced this way? And I know a LOT of people never check their statements.  These double-dips happen because someone at the business is not paying attention, or worse doing this on purpose. I'm very hesitant to return to a restaurant after I experience this once.  Rula Bula customers, check your credit card statements.",

    "text": "It's official - I have found my favorite place in Arizona for fish and chips. We came here last night with a large group for drinks before going to see a show at the Marquee Theater but my boyfriend and I snuck off to the bar area inside and ordered a bite to eat. I don't think anyone in the group really noticed we were gone. Plus, it's like 90 degrees outside so A/C sounded really nice to us...  There is a tiny TV in the corner so of course, we sat right in front of it so that my boyfriend could indulge in March Madness or whatever (He loves sports, me - not so much).  Anyway, I ordered a black velvet - it is essentially Guinness with champagne. Brian got a black-and-tan, which is Guinness and harp. I felt like we were preparing for St. Patty's Day (which is today!). I enjoyed my black velvet and would order it again because I personally enjoy Guinness and champagne separately. I also used to work at a Tilted Kilt when I was in college so I would always have a snakebite and a shot after my shifts - loved my Guinness beverages.  The fish and chips were perfect! The cod was battered with the right amount of seasoning and instead of french fries, the dish is served with potato slices. Brian really enjoyed the potato slices but we wished they were a little more crispy. I wish I could give you a better description about the food but that was all we ordered. Because of the sweet tooth I have, I was eyeing up the bread pudding but we decided to leave our seats at the bar and join the rest of our group on the outside patio bar area. So I didn't get it but we will next time! Ugh, if it weren't St. Paddy's Day, we'd go tonight but I'd rather skip the bustle.",

My card was  charged and signed before I got my beer so I couldn't leave (FYI $15 for 2 beers). Without any apology whatsoever we left. Do not go here.

They offer a great patio space providing room for small groups up to large groups parties.  They host a fantastically fun St. Patrick's Day party including singers and traditional Irish dance troops.  Iv'e experienced this event several times with no fail of a great time!!! The staff has always been accommodating and friendly. Parking is provided in the lot on the north side of the restaurant along with a free parking code for up to 2 hours.  The atmosphere inside is warm, cozy, and clean.  I like all the wood and stained glass decor and the bar is a great one to 'belly' up to. If you're looking for a comfortable place that serves great Irish food, give it a try.  The chef is typically open for special requests as I have made a few without any attitude or hassle. Give this place a try.  And yes, there is a Happy Hour....perfect if you have a fun group of friends in need of a Friday night fix! :)",

They have a prime location and are right next to a metered parking lot. Parking is free (for 2hrs) if you're eating there so make sure you get a code to use at the meter before you eat! The beer selection reminded us of our time in Ireland and we were surprised to be able to get Kilkenny, which we haven't found many other places in the States anymore.   The food? DELICIOUS! Skip the fries, get the Irish chips! Our server, Rachel, was right on top of things too. I don't think we really had to ask for anything because she anticipated what we'd need and she was spot on with her food recommendations too. The chicken tenderloins were house-made and delicious! So much better than anything from a chain restaurant. Their mac & cheese can be a \"create your own\". My husband tried it with shrimp and said it was some of the best he's had. Also, the patio is huge! Hopefully next time we go it'll be a little warmer so we can sit outside and enjoy the weather and great food!",

They'll literally walk by your table and not stop, if they do stop at a table in your area they don't usually stop at others in the area to just check in.   Tonight the kitchen was closed at 11:30p, but again no waitresses made their way to my table to ask if we'd like drinks or food. We found out the kitchen was closed after we went looking for servers. The interesting thing is on their website the late night menu is available from 9pm until close, close is 2am. We wanted to order from the late night menu.  The positives:  The bouncers are always polite.   They have great live bands on weekends, which is fun.   Overall, the atmosphere is fun.  You can bring children before 9pm, after that it's a bar atmosphere.",

I think the chef is maybe apathetic but there is nothing wrong here. Service was generally bad. I think our poor waitress was just having a very bad day. I felt bad for her. She wasn't mean and she wasn't busy. It took forever for her to check on us. I was half way through meal and needed a refill which took ten minutes for her to come by.   I like the place and while three stars might sound mean it's a bar if you want drinks this is a great place and if your hungry the food and service is average",

The burger was huge and cooked exactly to order and the fries were nice and crispy (the coffee was quite good too).  I had never tried a Banger before, but once again I was not disappointed; it's kind of like a cross between a Braut & a breakfast sausage.

I think their outdoor patio is one of the best in the area. The only downfall to the place is the service. It is very hit or miss on how long you sit before someone gets to you- even on slow days.

So I checked with the bartender to make sure they're still serving food. He said they should be until 11pm and then it's like some sort of reverse happy hour. So we seat ourselves and the busser comes around and takes away the table condiments. I'm asking him why he's removing them. He's like the kitchen is closed. I told him that's not what the bartender said. So he goes to double check. Comes back and apologizes and brings back the condiments and some water for us. Finally a waitress comes around and takes our order. She seems impatient and in a hurry. We order our food right of the bat. Then we order beer. Skip to the food... food was fine. She checked on us once but never refilled our water once. About 45 minutes later she asks if there's anything else we can get. We say the check. She has it ready immediately. I'm ok. Someone wants to get out of here and must have had a bad day.. but damn.. really? Our check was $50.50. We split the check. I wrote $27.25 and my partner wrote $29. Less than 5% tip, however that's arguable. Both of us checked our bank accounts later that night and somehow someone decided to enter in $30.30 a 20% tip of their own, which is not what we wrote or agreed to. We are legally obligated to pay for or food. Not give a 20% tip. That's not ok. Hope they don't do it again.",

I didn't have any service issues sitting at the bar, nothing out of the ordinary on a crowded weekend night.   It IS a place where friends just hang out with beers in their hand, sometimes trying to jig to the catchy Celtic bands playing the middle. On Halloween, my friends and I were out in the back patio and a girl in the tower of the adjoining hotel gave everyone down below a nice stripshow. Bonus star.  I guess the downside of the bar is with the high ceilings and bright lights it doesn't have that authentic Irish pub feel, but who am I kidding.   We're in Tempe.   Which also means smoke-free Irish bar, and until May rolls around, Rula definitely has the leg up on the two McCaffrey's...  4 Stars.",

All their food is home style like your mom made it.  If the service was a little, and I mean just a little bit, better they'd get my fifth star.

    "text": "Rula Bula is among my favorite bars in town, and is easily my favorite place on Mill.  They have a great atmosphere with awesome live music, and while it can get crowded on busy nights, it's never so packed that you can't move around.  The patio is great year-round (they have heaters for when it gets \"cold\"), and they have a full bar inside and out.  The inside is gorgeous and feels classy without being pretentious.  As far as prices go, they're not the cheapest, but it's reasonable.  The best part is they have a great whisky/whiskey selection - amongst the best in Tempe (if not the best)!  I can't recommend Rula enough!",

Not sure if he was messin around but he made me smile so he can see if my lilps matched my lips in the picture.  It was a good way to check an ID that's for sure, but geez, really?  Anyway, we hung out in the back outside.  They had mists on because it was so hot.  I sat in a spot where the mist was dripping.  I guess it was a good thing because I didn't feel much from the mist.  We hungout here for a bit til more friends met up with us.  Our waiter/bartender was good, fast too.  Music played was good.  Drink prices were decent.  I don't know the price but I just know we ordered a lot of drinks and it didn't come up too expensive like at clubs...that's all I can say for now.",

The outdoor patio is especially nice, both on nice days, and even in the winter (they have epic heaters outside).   The happy hour is great, both for food and booze.  They don't have a ton of vegetarian options, so I've been using this place as more of a bar than a place for food.  However, their bread pudding is surprisingly delicious, and worth ordering. Also, in the winter, they have alcoholic hot chocolate, which is AMAZING. Really, really amazing.  Staff is nice and helpful, really fun. Wednesday night is trivia night, so they'll be packed. Be forewarned.  This is a great place to meet friends for a pint (they have cider too!) and have a good time.  Not a great place for vegetarians to eat.",

We had dinner here last night, the food leaves much to be desired.  Not sure when they won best fish & chips, but they're not very good.  I'm looking forward to trying some other places.  Overall, I think Rula Bula is worth it for happy hour drinks and apps, but not for an actual meal.  It's not much like an actual Irish pub, which is depressing.  I love pubs, and this doesn't meet the mark.",

Bringing out the Irish in me....what does that mean!? Don't think the Irish and Chinese ever mixed in history...or did we?

I was at a bachelorette party and I am not a big drinker so I only had a beer.  I watched as the waiter \"bought\" a round of shots of the girls.  They each had a mixed drink or two and they WAY overcharged the girls assuming they were too drunk to remember.  This has happened at another bachelorette party I went to as well. Maybe this is just an Arizona thing?  Every time the waiter \"buys\" rounds of shots and then charges the table.  Not to mention that the mixed drinks here are REALLY expensive.   If you are into the Mill crowd and you want a party I suppose this place works, but be aware of your drinks and make sure you are charged correctly.  Do not just \"open a tab\" here.",

I had the Irish Cobb Salad with their house made garlic herb vinaigrette.  Best Cobb salad I have ever had!  So fresh and the chicken was cooked perfectly.  There is a tendency to overcook it on a salad.  Service was on par and very friendly!  Will definitely be back on my next visit to the area!  Oh, and there was live music too.

As someone who has spent a lot of time in Ireland, I'm pretty picky when it comes to Irish food. And I have very little patience for Americanized Irish food.  First impressions: * Downtown Tempe is super cool * The decor is legit inside of Rula Bula * The staff are super nice, especially the bartender who helped us (tall white male, tattoos, plugs - didn't catch his name) * They have Magners on draft! Which I've never seen in the US  Unfortunately the food wasn't that great. I got the steak and guinness pie and it was a bit bland. The portion was generous and all meat but it needed more Guinness and more salt. The sides were very good.  My Mom got Fish and Chips and she wasn't that impressed either. The pieces were small and also bland.  BUT on a happy note, my friend got the Mussels and really enjoyed them.  I would absolutely go back, they have cool stuff happening every night. And the bartender was super cool. But I don't know that I would eat here again. Probably just drink. The food prices just aren't justified.  (That said, I do want to go back for breakfast and see how their Full Irish Breakfast is)",

I've usually gone later in the evening when they have someone out front checking IDs. I understand that while being so close to the university they have to scrutinize as to not compromise their business, but MY GOD. And the guy was SO RUDE. He insisted my ID didn't look like me (I had shorter hair in the photo), so I pulled out my military ID which had a more recent photo. He was just as rude to my friend and brother while checking their IDs, treating us as though we were trying to get away with something. My friend is 29, my brother is 25, and I'm 26...never had such an issue trying to have a good time.   Once we were on the patio with drinks in hand, the same douchebag was going table to table RECHECKING IDs, interrupting everyone's good time.  He came to our table, my brother have him his ID AGAIN, and the dude harassed him for 5 minutes claiming the photo didn't look like him.  The only difference, literally, was that my brother was wearing his glasses that night. We finished our one drink and left. As I walked out, I thanked Mr. Power Trip for ruining our experience and he only have me a dirty look.  I wanted to channel Leslie Mann and scream, \"you're nothing but a door man! Door man! DOOR MAN!!!\" But he wasn't worth another minute of my life. Will not go back because of door man.",

    "text": "When giving reviews I'm always hesitant to give REALLY critical remarks unless I believe my remarks can benefit the business somehow.  I see a lot of potential with this place. Being one of few locations in all of Phoenix that serves an Irish interpretation of food, there is plenty of opportunity for this restaurant to grow with their clientele.  However, before doing so, there are some stark fundamentals of how this business runs its processes that really irk me.  Simply put, there is a lack of consistency all around. You can see this by how diverse the reviews are. 5 star, 1 star, 4 star, 2 star, 5 star, 1 star, etc and so forth.  Some servers here are wonderful, attentive, assertive, and knowledgeable in the business' food menu. Some servers are just a-ok.  The host was either hungover, or simply didn't care about their job, the lack of greeting when my girlfriend and I entered the establishment was too telling, and the lack of charisma let alone eye contact with us as customers further reinforced this.  Now, onto the menu: The menu has some very solid traditional food offerings. Things like Shepard's Pie and Corned Beef and Cabbage are familiar and can be seen as the \"prime\" of the menu.  As a server though, I was not offered any menu suggestions, or given anything beyond the standard server experience.   This among other reasons is what makes this place just \"average\". It's a shame, though, given the uniqueness of some aspects in this restaurant, and they sort of just let it go to average. Which, to me, is a waste in this business. You need to have a \"wow\" factor as a restaurant, and it's so simple, we're not asking you to remodel the tables with new plywood, we're just asking for your servers to be more engaging with the customer.  When our food was delivered, we were not offered any additions, like extra napkins, or a refill on my clearly emptied water. Again, not a bad thing, but not good either. Just average.   To summarize, from a customer POV, mix of good and bad points:  FRONT OF THE HOUSE: * Entered restaurant, the host seemed disinterested and seated us at a table where an elderly person's walker was present * Server who was not our table's greeted my girlfriend and I, but host did not. I don't think I'm allowed to state names on Yelp reviews, so I'll just describe the server who was not ours as having VERY bright red hair. * Server who was not our table's was VERY friendly and gave equal attention to both girlfriend and I. This is a GREAT plus, and why I didn't give a two-star rating. The \"front of the house\" in a restaurant can make or break a restaurant going experience for your customer. * Server who WAS our table's was friendly * Our server was a bit slow to get our drinks (waited for 5+ minutes after being seated). * Our server was nice with accepting our food order * Our server checked in with us after the food was delivered. * Our server was keen on details and identified the check that my girlfriend hid from the table because my girlfriend doesn't want me to pay for the bill (lol)  THE FOOD: * My parsley garnish on my eggs benedict had grit in them. The parsley was clearly not washed before being minced. OR, the parsley was cut on a dirty board. * The temperature of the potatoes in my eggs benedict dish were not hot. It was as if someone had cooked them, and let them cool for too long. * The cabbage in my girlfriend's corned beef and cabbage dish was not cooked all the way. I am unsure if this is a restaurant preference or if the cook was just lazy and didn't want to wait for the cabbage to cook all the way.  THE BEVERAGES: * We ordered ice water, as we went for lunch and weren't feeling any alcoholic drinks.  * Water came out relatively quickly, had ice, however, I finished mine quickly and was never offered a refill  All in all, it's average right now, but there's hope for the business from a lunchtime perspective. I really hope the business owner takes this review to heart, because I mean well. I didn't want to have to give Rula Bula a 2 star review, but as Yelp states for 2 stars.... \"Meh, I've experienced better.\"  You can be a 3 star restaurant, or even a 4 star with just a little more effort in how you engage your customers and handle your food. Washing parsley takes seconds. A food warmer is  great one-time investment. Coaching your servers and rewarding them for good behavior strengthens your business all around, and more importantly, it makes your customers want to return.",

I think they have changed the way they cut the corned beef, prefer them to cut it thick. We also sat outside because we decided to eat during the Tempe Art Festival. Regretted that move. Smokers sitting at the bar that was right behind my table. I am the worst kind of complainer of cigarette smoke, i quit smoking years ago and the smell just gets to me. I have the nose from hell and i kept smelling it, gag me. I Still like the atmosphere of this place and not writing it off yet, i will just chose to eat in doors and order something different.  I would however love more options for my gluten free allergy.  Sure, we'll come back.",

    "text": "First off, let me say that Rula Bula is one of my favorite pubs to just chill and get a great cocktail. They also introduced me to one of my favorite snack-and-drink combos: the Irish chips with curry dipping sauce and a glass of Irish Mule (or maybe two ;) )   So why am I giving them a barely 3-star review right now? It's sad to say but last night, I realized as good as their curry sauce and Irish Mule are; they are probably the only two things I'll ever order from Rula Bula.   The Irish dip I ordered last night was mediocre. Since I know the Irish chips are thicker than regular chips, I specifically asked for mine to be extra crispy and they came out even soggier than normal :(   Service: I has received good service here from most of my visits before. However, my server last night was not very attentive. She took a really long time to notice that we were ready to order our food. Once received our orders, she took another while to come by and check on us. So I never even bother to ask for a side of ranch that I originally wanted.   Overall, this review is specifically for my experience from last night. I am sure Rula Bula can and will do better than this.",

They could punch me in the neck when I walked in, and i would still give them five stars for those two reasons.  Almost all the food is good (though I can count the number of times I've had anything other than the above on one hand). The happy hour is great, with half off appetizers, including the fish nuggets, which are the fish 'n' chips I eat before I eat the fish 'n' chips.  The world's most competitive trivia night. These people STUDY for trivia night.   Great outdoor seating, good service. Decor is interesting, especially if you like this particular famous race horse that I currently forget the name of but is the subject of approximately 90% of the wall art.",

    "text": "My friends and I have heard great reviews about Rula Bula, a traditional and modern Irish Pub on Mill Avenue. The reviews were so awesome, we decided to venture out to Tempe to experience it for ourselves, and the pub didn't disappoint. The location wasn't far from where we parked and it's not hard to miss. The lighting was low, a collection of glass bottles were lined across the bar, and an array of authentic Irish decorations and paintings filled the restaurant. You can choose to sit inside or outside on the patio; due to the Arizona heat we sat inside.                   We didn't have much experience in Irish cuisine so thankfully, our waiter was very helpful and an expert on the menu. The menu was easy to navigate and offered many authentic Irish dishes. Many of the entrees were labeled \"Voted Best of Phoenix\" and their grilled cheese made an appearance on Food Network, which is very impressive. I ordered the traditional Shepherd's Pie and noticed that they also served a Vegetarian Shepherd's Pie which is convenient because one of my friends is a vegetarian.                  Our food arrived in a timely manner and was served hot. The appearance and aroma was very appetizing; needless to say, the food was excellent. All friends, including myself, we're pleased with the environment, food, and service. We thought our night couldn't get better when a band of bagpipes and drums come marching through the restaurants' doors. Their melodious music filled the pub as the guests stared in awe at the traditional instruments. Overall, this facility should continue the terrific work and should expect another visit from my friends and I soon.",

The staff was friendly, the bar tenders nice, fun and actually helpful, and the music, while not live, was at the perfect level.  Most of my group got food, and watching the locust like destruction, I'd have to guess it was all pretty good.  Their drink prices are still a little high, but at least the pours seemed to match this time around.    I'll be willing to keep going back if the service and atmosphere keeps improving like this.",

The menu said that the fish and chips were voted \"best in Phoenix\" and sited the fresh made batter as the key to the dish's quality. With my expectations raised, I settled in to enjoy the two-piece meal.   It was ok. The breading, while definitely different from other places, did not add that much to the fish. In fact, it was actually pretty thin which meant that it did not stand up to the weight of the fish. I had to resort immediately to a knife and fork. Most people probably eat fish and chips that way by default, but personally, I like to eat this type of meal with my fingers. The fish was slightly over-cooked, but still tasted good.  The atmosphere was a little on the chain side of of the spectrum, but Rula Bula has enough of the pub staples to be comfortable. The service staff were very friendly.  All in all, I'd go again. If you are looking for a an Irish Pub experience in Tempe, Rula Bula will serve you well. However, if they really do have the best fish and chips in Phoenix, then the bar is not insurmountably high.",

I typically order the corned beef sandwich on rye and it is sublime.  The three cheese grilled cheese sandwich is also very, very good.  While some feel that the beer selection leaves a lot to be desired I have never really seen it as a problem.   My only complaints about this establishment are their lack of a \"True\" happy hour and the crowd that sometimes fills it's patio.  On a few occasions the patio bar has been occupied by some of the scummy mill crowd which is a disappointment as this is normally a great place.   I would highly recommend Rula Bula to anyone looking for some great Irish grub at a reasonable price.",

    "text": "I have been to Rula Bula quite a few times and cannot really remember anything memorable about it, so I was a little concerned selecting it as the starting place for my groups pub crawl. I was actually really pleasantly surprised with the outcome despite a few less-than-desirable things.   The patio area was a great choice. Plenty of room to accommodate our large crowd, both smokers and not. They also have Strongbow, which made me happy (just wish Amanda could have been there to share a glasss!!!)   There was an incredibly drunken guy sitting at the bar who was loud and obnoxious. It took a little too long for the bartender to kick him out.   As Gabi mentioned in her review, the bathrooms were pretty gross and certainly not maintained throughout the day.   As for food, I had the cheese and tomato sandwich on wheat with the potato fries. I was pleasantly surprised by my food and I really loved those little tasty fries. Yum!   Our server was able to accommodate all of us Yelpers pretty easily, although I ordered at the bar.   Overall Rula Bula is okay... but I certainly would never plan my evening around it.",

Yes, there are other breweries outside of Ireland, but America only receives Guinness from Ireland.  So, it stands to reason, that Rula Bula would, indeed, have imported-from-Ireland Guinness. That is nothing special.   However, the two times I've been to Rula Bula, the Guinness was poured well (one server even attempted the shamrock in the head... she didn't quite succeed, but she was new and it was the effort that counts).  Also, the food it super yummy!  I can't wait to drive back to Arizona in a few weeks, just so I can have the whiskey bread pudding again! It is the stuff of dreams and nightmares... nightmares only because I'm always too full to eat it all- but it's always too delicious to stop eating it!",

Basic beer, mixed drinks, etc.  It is strange, but this place did not have a unique feel to it.  I could have been anywhere.........",

It's one color during the day and another at night. It's complicated even more so depending on whether school is in session or not. Lunch on a weekday in the summer yields friendly waitresses in a history-rich, inviting restaurant. Visit on a Friday or Saturday evening in the fall and you can expect a rushed/stressed wait staff and a packed house of loud, drink-loving college students. Each has their pros and cons, but the experience may be drastically different from one visit to the next.",

This place is an excellent excuse of an Irish Bar.  It is too big and airy for the Pub name.  To be fair, I do avoid this place on Fri and Sat nights, most of the other nights though it is a great, fun place to hang out.  They often have music, you can check the internet for details (sic).  One of my favorite aspects of this place is that inside and the back porch are two completely different feels.  I really like both, but prefer the porch at night unless there is good music.  Very chill and same stuff on tap and plate  The drinks here are expensive, but not necessarily over-priced.  The Guiness is thicker here, I think it is the imported kind.  They have an excellent selection of liquors, especially whiskey.  Their prices are better for expensive Irish Whiskey than other bars in the valley.   The food I've had is fusion Irish and very good.  The Beef and Guiness Boxty is heavy and delicious.  The salads are inventive.  Snacks are also good and high quality, the Irish Chips come with two great sauces and are a great snack over many drinks.  Go on a Thursday or Sunday night for dinner and drinks.  I think there is an open mic on Tuesdays",

I dont go to Rula's that often but when i do go, its always been a good experience. only once have i gone there and just found it way too crowded for me to enjoy my time there but it can get pretty busy in there, especially Fri-Sat.  The staff is very friendly. On one occasion i went there with a friend and she asked me whats good here, i simply stated\"ask the bartender\" and the bartender proceeded to ask her what types of beers she drinks and then gave her some recommendations based on her taste. Most bars point you the the wall of beers and say \"any of those are good\" Also on that same night she had left her coat on a bar-stool outside and the bartender immediately saw that and placed it behind the bar. when she started to panic because she realized she lost her coat, the manager came up to us and said they have her coat and went outside grabbed her coat and brought it back to her.   Try the Magners Cider \"good stuff Maynard\"",

It wasn't the typical Scottsdale/Tempe club scene, which was nice. It's an old-looking Irish style bar with a stage, decent sized dance floor, and an awesome patio. There was a $2 cover, I'm assuming because they had a live band playing, but it was well worth it. I had a black and tan followed by a snakebite and both were delicious. I stayed for maybe an hour, watched the band, and met some cool people on the patio. Overall, a really fun place with a great selection of beer on tap and a fun, chill crowd that isn't overly into themselves.",

However, the last time I ate there the potatoes in my stew were very bitter, which means they were too old and too high in that chemical that forms when potatoes are too old, creating a bitter taste and gut aches. They left an awful aftertaste. When we were leaving I told the food server that the potatoes were too old so they were disgustingly bitter and she said, \"Really?\" That was it; lousy customer service in response to a complaint of bad food because the kitchen used ingredients that should have been thrown out.  I haven't eaten there since.",

My water glass was always full, and I never had to wait for my next refill on the blue moon.  Also, one of our group asked for a vodka soda, and the waitress said, it's cheaper if  you are having more than one to jsut get a tall double.   WHAT?

Last time we went, we decided to try items we had not had before, so we opted to share the Fisherman's Platter (with 4 shrimp, 2 pieces of fish, and 1 scallop and chips) and the Irish Mac & Cheese with Rashers (bacon pieces). The Mac was not as stellar as I hoped, but that didn't stop us from finishing the dish. It needed a bit more seasoning, I think. The Platter was good, but the standout for us both was the chips- 1/4 inch slabs of potato cooked to perfection and sprinkled with salt and pepper. The coleslaw was also the way I like it-crispy, and not too sweet. The meal also came with two types of Irish soda bread and a side salad, which made a very nice lunch the next day, as we were completely stuffed from the dishes we shared. Service was attentive, and the prices are fair. We'll be back for the boxty, for sure.",

    "text": "This was my first time trying Rula Bula. My boyfriend had been previously and spoke very highly of it. So during an evening stroll on Mill Avenue, we decided it would make a great spot for dinner.  I had the shepherds pie and he had the bangers and mash... Both were exceptional. The menu noted that the shepherds pie had been voted \"best of Phoenix\", and I quickly realize why. The dish was savory and flavorful, comfort food at its finest!  Despite becoming full only a third of the way through my meal, I pressed on! I told myself that each bite would be my last until there was nothing left on my plate.  I'm not sure what wizardry was used to create this meal, but I feel it might be black magic & I'm totally okay with that.  If I could give them 6 stars, I would.",

The waitress said she was going to check if dinner menu was available. She came back without saying anything and changed the menus.

    "text": "For March's International Supper Club we picked Rula Bula, a local favorite Irish Pub in the Tempe area.   We were a party of 14, and for some parts our server struggled a bit with keeping orders straight, for got some drink orders, brought the incorrect ones but overall it went well. It was a few days before St Patrick's day and we were out on the patio area, and have to say while the weather was perfect, seating outside was the place to be, you sort of forgot that you were just right off Mill ave.  I ordered a Smithwicks and that was delish and hit the spot, then ordered some potato skins and 3 piece fish and chips. The potato skins to me were slightly over cooked, instead of the cheese being oozy it was a little crisp, but don't worry they still were eaten. I should have gone with maybe a 1 piece fish and chip because they do not skimp on the sizes! 3 where just too many! But the fish was perfectly fried, it was crisp and tender and flaky, I was bummed that I couldn't finish the dish haha it was so good!  Rula Bula does offer codes to paid for 2 hours of parking, call them and they will give it to you, some of us were even worried that we might run out of time before our meal ended but our server took our parking numbers and added more time to our tickets, I thought that was cool!  If you are looking for a fun local Irish Pub to chill and enjoy the surrounds, go the patio area and enjoy yourself at Rula Bula!",

    "text": "I had this place bookmarked for over 3 years.  I finally went with a great group of Yelp-migos the Wednesday before St. Paddy's Day.   It was a beautiful night and our group of 13 (and a 1/2) sat outside on their lovely patio.  Our waiter was visibly overwhelmed and we all wondered how the heck he was going to fare the hordes on Friday (St. Patty's Day), if he couldn't handle our little group.   At the end of our evening, I saw him getting annoyed when several people asked for to-go boxes for our leftovers. This could've been rectified by him asking who needed boxes. Large parties typically have multiple ongoing conversations and seasoned servers know to do this to avoid the back and forth trips. Overall, the service was good and our server even went to extend our parking codes since it took a while to receive our food.  On to the food.  VEGAN REVIEW: I noticed that they have expanded their vegan menu and now offer Beyond Meat \"Chicken\" as an alternative for salads and wraps.  They offer vegan mayo, upon request (it's not listed on the menu, so just ask).    I ordered the San Patricio wrap and modified it to be vegan. I got the Beyond Meat \"chicken,\" spinach, avocado, vegan mayo, all wrapped in a spinach tortilla. It was pretty good, but they could season the Beyond Meat in order to give it more flavor.  The french fries were crispy and delicious! There's also a vegan Shepherd's Pie, made with red potatoes, that was really tasty.    Be advised that the veggie burger patty is NOT vegan and they have no vegan buns. You can get a lettuce wrap, tortilla, or flatbread, all of which are vegan.   Most side orders (kale, cabbage, etc.) can be modified to be vegan if you specify no meat, butter, cheese, etc.; sub olive oil.  I was informed that they will be doing Meatless Mondays and more vegan options if enough customers request it.   They offer patrons 2 hours of free parking in the adjacent parking lot; contact the restaurant for the code.  They also offer free wifi for customers.",

The meter maid then lied and said just call the city on Monday and they'll dismiss it because there's nothing she could do once it's issued. Called and emailed the city, played several rounds of \"not my job\", finally had to return to Tempe, setup a court date. Which by the way can ONLY be on Friday. Can't wait to goto court and have the final city official completely let me down and remove all faith I have left in humanity.  The city completely blames Rula Bula saying they should just discount our bill and their policy is at fault. However the food at Rula Bula is good and I love their tap selection, this was only my second time there for food and sadly I won't return. The staff was nice, waitress was too new to judge harshly for our hiccups inside but the parking situation is a problem.  Fast forward 3 weeks, we had our day in court. The judge says Tempe was correct to ticket you but you weren't wrong so you don't have to pay the ticket. Going forward we'll just avoid Tempe. I hope Rula Bula opens another location outside Tempe.",

I honestly can't remember what my friend ordered and I apologize for that. I had the award winning fish & chips. I totally get the award thing, this dish was absolutely perfect! I have no idea how to fry fish and potato slices and have them come out not at all greasy- not a bit! Maybe they bake 'em, don't know... The batter on the fish was light, correct amount and light golden brown. The fish was flaky, perfectly cooked and outstanding! The chips were potato slices also delectable. There were no random potato ends, just perfect slices. I opted out of vinegar, instead I got a side of house tartar sauce. It too was excellent. There was a trivia contest going on but it wasn't distracting. While the front matches the rest of Mill Ave brick-a-brac the inside had the look of early/middle 19th Century. The patio looked gorgeous and the staff were attentive, polite and friendly. I'm headed back soon",

With rotating beers on draught (good selection to boot), and a full bar you'll have plenty of drinking options.   The food is actually good! Well above standard pub grub fare- try the Irish sliders. Staff is usually pretty cool, but they can get a little testy when the pace is crowded. You may even wait a bit between drinks.",

But if your going to be a pricey Irish Pub you better be great at both. My father ran authentic Irish Pubs in Milwaukee WI. I know quite a bit about the bar and restaurant business. The owner should be available or if he is not, he should never wonder why some things don't bring in money. It's the inconsistent service, surly managers, a hostess that seemed to hate seating people etc. You don't play Irish music. I am told that is because you are in a spot close to a university . Funny, Trininty Hall Irish Pub in Dallas is just a stone's throw from SMU, yet still have a wide menu, Irish music, Sports, poker night, trivia and a staff that goes out of there way to know your name when you come in every week. We moved in mid-November and have come about once a week, yet, not a single soul in your \" Craic\" pub, knows us. I blame an absentee owner.",

Burgers were well above board, and Rula Bula serves some of the best steamed mussels in the Valley. Vegetarian shepherds pie was good scran. And the wait staff were funny and friendly.

Then the server announced that all apps were half price.  Not sure if that's a happy hour thing or not.    We had a few things to share.  Here are the results.  The lemon shrimp app was pretty good -- a cold shrimp dish, which we weren't expecting since it didn't say that on the menu.  And the smoked salmon plate with cukes, onions and capers.  A steal for $4!  The salmon was good and went well with the soda bread.  We also shared a Shepherd's Pie.  The meat was good and it wasn't too greasy or running.  Just right!

I've never eaten here but everyone seems to like it. The most recent visit, I went 2-3 weeks ago on a Friday night and the bouncers checked my friend's ID. He gets asked how many beers he expected to have, he answered and they denied entry. Which is funny because my friend is 35-36, so the GenY \"bouncer\" was still a zygote when this dude first started pounding beers. And that's the last time I went to Rula Bula.   The fact is Tempe is just no longer that cool. It's just another Phoenix suburb with the same douchebag meatheads and plastic sorostitutes as Scottsdale. Oh, speaking of which, the girl-guy ratio here is fucking terrible (if you're a straight dude). Bottom line, come here if you want to pay 5 bucks for a Blue Moon and say, \"I'm drinking in an Irish Bar!\" Otherwise, you can pay 30% less and get the same drinking experience across the street at Tavern.",

A bit more of the tempura batter feel to it than, say, the harder/crispy coating on H. Salt or something.  Taste was good but got a bit soggy as it sat.  The chips were cool.  Not fries but potato discs.  In that sense, more like American potato chips (fish & chips, get it?) but thick cut, much thicker than a kettle cooked chip.  Good and crispy on the outside, but starchy potato on the inside.  I liked 'em.  Also had the mussels which were cooked in a thin alfredo-ey type of sauce.  Pretty good.  And these Spicy Bollix potato balls--I thought they'd be like potato hush puppies or whatnot but they were much bigger and as it turns out, quite wet/gooey on the inside.  Seemed like fried poi.  But, they were quite spicy (definitely not traditional Irish here) and tasty, too.  I'd recommend a go.  Ambience was a faux, rustic pub feel but there was a live band playing later and they rocked some Pogues and Flogging Molly pretty well.",

Once you walk in, it looks like a quaint little restaurant. Until you step outside into the back patio. Then the True Rula Bula experience begins!  The back patio has a full bar that curves around back to the right. The patio is filled with tables and chairs that are filled with a wide variety of people, from the young, hot co-eds that go to ASU to the 9-to-5ers who are stopping in after work to the older-yet-hip crowd that still likes to get together in their 40s and 50s.   The greatest thing about this place is that even though it is busy, it's not impossible to get a drink at the bar. As long as you take care of your bartenders and be respectful, they'll come back and take care of all your drink needs.  Needless to say, we all left quite happy.  Definitely one of my stops when I come back to AZ!",

We got to the bar just as it was starting to get busy on a Friday night.  Our intentions were to have one drink and then go back to our hotel to get a good night's sleep, but the atmosphere held us in and we couldn't leave!  Unfortunately, we couldn't party too hard since we had to continue on our trip early the next morning, but we could easily see ourselves having too much fun here.    We didn't have any of the food and mostly chilled outside where it was starting to get crowded, but the bartenders were attentive.  There was a live band playing cover songs in a polka-style inside, and a bunch of people were dancing and having a good old time.  We will certainly remember to hit up this place if we ever revisit Tempe!",

Most of the Mill Ave. crowd know Rula Bula as a great bar but many forget about it as a lunch or dinner option.   They do a great lunch menu with sandwiches, Shepard's Pie ect. I usually get their French Dip with their house made fries which is almost too much food. Their fries are wonderful, basically sliced potatoes fried until they are golden brown. However, I have friends that swear the Shepard's Pie is the best thing on the menu.   The service can be a little slow as they often get hit with the convention crowd from the Tempe Mission Palms next door. However, it's affordable and just good home-style food.",

Our waiter was very friendly, made sure our drinks were refilled and that we had plenty of water, and even furnished us with silly party hats, streamers, and noisemakers. The fish and chips were tasty, made more so by the awesome tartar sauce, and the corned beef, though a little dry, was tasty too. The whole pib was assembled in Ireland, and is pretty charming and not at all pub-sized, with plentyof seating for all.",

Within a few minutes I met a bunch of people from the NW and as far east as Philly. They had some live music as well.  The outdoor bartender (Mike) was really cool and very attentive. The food is typical bar food but it tastes really fresh and is done right. We ordered the Boxty. A thin, crepe like pancake made with potatoes and filled with heaps of braised short rib. The bartender says they cook the short rib slow and overnight. It was served with perfectly seasoned and crunchy vegetables.   Overall I think this is a cool relaxing spot in downtown Tempe. I highly recommend it.",

For lunch we decided to visit this place, since it was so close to our hotel.  It was fairly quiet in there so we got seated and helped immediately.  Our server did a great job making sure we were happy and satisfied.  I believe her name was Rachel, very talkative lively lady, kudos to her for doing a good job. The next day we came here with a bunch of friends for some late night drinks.  All I can say was it was busy!  But I particularly liked the environment and feel of the place.  There was a live band rocking out to keep everyone entertained, the outside patio was alive with people but we all managed to find a great spot to chill out at.  The servers were incredibly polite and made sure everyone had a drink and didn't have to wait.  They also were very quick to clean up empty mugs. Overall some really good service here!  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the Tempe area.",

The inside and the outside are very large so it didn't give me that 'I feel so crowded that I can't breathe, touch me and die' feeling.  Usually I don't like Irish pubs because they tend to feel like caves but this one was quite the opposite.   The bartenders were all friendly and prompt.  Everyone there seemed to be having a good time.  There was even a live band which was Irish music.  When the band wasn't playing the music they had going was all pretty decent rock stuff.   My only complaint was the immense amount of cigarette smoke.  I guess it's my own fault for sitting outside...but it seemed like everyone there was smoking all at the same time and blowing it all in my direction.  Oh and also, the bathroom was pretty small for such a big place.   Anyways...  cool place.",

The others don't look like an Irish pub, have very very poor beer selections, and lack a substantive Irish demography inside from both staff and patrons. Rula Bula defies most of these downfalls of Phoenix area Irish pubs.  Whether or not this pub was disassembled and shipped here I'm not sure, but it looks just like the other pubs claiming this accomplishment. Authentic menu selections round out the place nicely, though on the pricey side for both food and beverage.  Staff could be more polite, even if the patrons are not Irish (as I am not). Just not a comfortable, inviting feel to me. College yuppie clientele seem common.  Beer selection is a typical limited selection of British and Irish imports. Nothing special.

Huge fan of the outside-patio set up; it offers enough room for large crowds to get their drink on while still providing a somewhat intimate feel for smaller parties looking for a more laid back night out.   As for the food and drinks; highhhhly suggest going with a frothy pint of Murphy's Stout, followed by a Shepard's Pie that'll leave you feeling as if you're eating in Dublin. Happy Hours are usually pretty solid as well.",

Well, you could ask for an authentically imported Irish beer too...but they have you covered in that aspect as well.",

For dessert, be sure to try the bread pudding, which is probably the best I've ever had.    It's a fun place when it's busy and has a great traditional Irish pub feel inside.  They pour a perfect pint; you'll notice the difference if you're a Guinness lover.  Rula Bula is a little pricey, which is the pretty much the only reason I haven't rated it a 5.",

I sent a photo to my friend in Dublin and he informed me of the translation.  We always get the pickle back shots when we go.  If you've never experienced a pickle back, you need to.  It is a shot of Jameson chased with a shot of pickle juice.  It does not sounds good, but it is flippin amazing.  My friends who aren't huge whiskey fans love them as well as it will kill the afterburn in your throat.  I love the Guinness BBQ sauce (my Irish pal says that's blasphemy, but it's because he hasn't tried it), so try the burger with the BBQ sauce.  This bar is also good for getting the various Irish draughts like Harp (Northern Ireland) and Smithwicks (Republic of Ireland), not to mention the Guinness staple.  We like to hang on the patio, but dining in the restaurant is just as fun.    Slainte!!!!",

However, the service is sub-par. Almost every time I've been here, there's been at least one issue (lack of waiters, waiting too long for drinks, waiters nowhere to be found, etc.)",

One EXPECTS to wait on St. Patrick's Day, but I never waited more than 3 minutes for a drink. We didn't partake in any food, but what I did see looked not only delicious, but Irish-authentic.   My complaint lies in the bathrooms. Ladies have 2 (!!!) stalls and on a busy night, you'll wait longer for the bathroom than you will a drink. Come on! When will businesses learn?!

    "text": "A disclaimer- yes, I went to ASU. Yes, I've been to Mill a few times. Did I know Rula Bula was anything more than a basic bar? Not really- not until I started reading an urban fantasy series written by local guy and all around cool gentleman named Kevin Hearne. It's especially fun being a native reading a book by a native, because protagonist's shop is on Mill, and is bookended by stores that actually do exist. He lives in Tempe, just south of ASU, and he's got his own favorite joints to eat at. All of which are local.  Which is also where Rula Bula comes in. Because apparently they make \"the best fish and chips in town\". Fish and chips? The best? Are you sure??? I had to check it out. Problem is I live and work in North Phoenix now. Trips out to Mill are few and far between. Until I went out there for a photoshoot. Voila, perfect reason to go eat there.  Now I did NOT get the fish and chips. But my husband did, and holy cannoli, they are good. Crispy and light, tender on the inside. I got the braised beef & Guinness boxty. Because I'd heard about boxtys before, but what WERE they? Are they good? Could you really go wrong with beef slow braised in Guiness? The answer, wee bairns, is no. Holy cannoli did I mention it was good? Savory and rich with a hint of bitterness. And a boxty is a bit like a crepe. It was stuffed with the meat, and you ripped it apart with your fork (no knife really needed), and shoveled this goodness into your mouth. My girlfriend got the shepherd's pie, and you know it's a good place when they master the classics. I'm not sure I've ever tasted a shepherd's pie this good.   The drinks menu was also pretty cool- I always enjoy trying out whatever craft cocktails they claim to have. Mine was... okay. I just remember really loving my girlfriend's. I tried looking at the website to jog my memory but can't find a drinks menu. Suffice to say it was warm and appley and had a stick of cinnamon to stir with. This was right around Thanksgiving time and there was a bit of a chill in the wind outside, so it was just absolutely perfect.   My vote? Absolutely go to Rula Bula, and do yourself a favor and skip the drunken frat crowd. Go early enough so you can get dinner, because to me that's where this place really shines.",

Waiter told me it also comes with sides including french fries or mac and cheese for an upgrade.  French fries when shepherd's pie has a mashed potato topping?  Nope.  mac and cheese?  It would be a disappointment (my readers know that I am Queen of the mac and cheese-don't ask for the recipe please.  It is as secret as the IRS lost emails.)   I also had a choice of soup.  Leek/potato or french onion soup.  Leek & potato it is.  Nice irish soup until I tasted it.  Two large pieces of RAW POTATOES in the middle of a not so stellar watery soup base.  Tasted oniony but not good oniony.  Like onion soup mix with leeks in it.  Well, regardless of this, people don't eat raw potatoes unless you are camping out in the woods and the flame gives out.  (Can you tell I love camping?)   The waiter took it back and gave me french onion soup.  Much better.  Quite nice as a matter of fact.  Next, the shepherd's pie.  The top of it is usually put inside a broiler (a salamander in restaurant talk) to give it a nice color.  Not so.  This was very blonde.  Doesn't mean it's not going to be good right?  Right.  Actually it was pretty good.  The sirloin inside was not greasy and with the veggies in it it was quite a nice interplay.  So would I order it again?  Yeah, maybe but this time with a Guiness or a Sam Adam's beer.  I was driving and didn't want to take a chance with having the Tempe or Scottsdale cops give me a breathalyzer so a nice cold glass of water accompanied my meal instead.  No carbonated drinks (not good for your bones-bet you didn't know that! ).   Service was fine..  Despite the fact that it was a Wednesday night, they had quite a clientele.   Glad I tried it.  I was always curious about the place.  Now I know.",

Haven't tried the food personally but it looks good from what I've seen. Attentive and friendly staff and a good selection of drinks. Prices aren't anything special but the atmosphere makes up for that, it is on mill after all.

    "text": "Ah Rula Bula.  How far you have fallen in recent years.  What once was a warm, friendly and enjoyable \"home pub\" venue has changed over the last several years into a disorganized and seemingly mismanaged establishment.  If you are in any way familiar with Mill Avenue and Tempe, you likely know about and have been to Rula Bula.  It is a literal cornerstone of social and gastronomic life on Mill Avenue in Tempe. Having worked in Tempe for nigh on 15 years now, I've been a patron here for many a year.  Once the highlight of an office outing or a simple lunch with a friend or co-worker, the last several visits here have resulted in poor service and mediocre food.    We have a fairly large group to accommodate (10-15 people) and as such, always call ahead to make reservations.  Our last trip here at least started better than the last few (in which they completely forgot/ignored our reservations and ended up having to wait for them to clear customers and tables for us).  The tables were indeed ready for us upon the specified arrival time.  I was somewhat glad that we were on the back patio area, as the interior of the restaurant itself was overly warm.  Our reservation was for 15 and 14 of us were there within a few minutes of each other.  Drinks were fairly prompt, though all at the table commented that their drinks (from soda to water) all had an odd taste to them.  Perhaps the ice had been tainted with something?  Also the soda's were all very flat and watery.    We then proceeded to wait a good 20-30 minutes awaiting someone to return to our table and begin taking orders.  We finally flagged down one of the servers and his comment was along the lines of, \"Oh, are you ready to order?\"  Now, it's possible that they were waiting for our last person to show up.  Maybe.  However, any seasoned server knows that group luncheons are a dynamic event.  There are often times less or more than what the reservation is made for.  Some show up late, some leave early.  If it was in question, a simple \"Are you all waiting for someone or are you ready to order\" a few minutes into our arrival (like when they delivered the drinks) would have resolved this.    When a server finally did attend our table, his greeting was prefaced with the suggestion that we split our entire tab into 15 equal amounts to make it easier and faster for him to process upon completion of our meal.  Never in the whole of my gastrological life has a server suggested that we structure our payment in a fashion that is more convenient for them.  Be that as it may, we quickly discussed it and agreed to this.  We had already been there some time and as it was a work luncheon, didn't have a limitless amount of time.    Orders were taken and then the next long wait began.  An hour after arriving, our 15th member joined us and we still did not have our food.  Unfortunate or fortunate?  At least he got to eat with us, right?    Shortly after this, our food arrived.  For myself, I ordered the bangers and mash.  Pretty traditional dish for irish pub food.  Three half portions of bangers, served on a bed of mash with a red onion gravy.  Back in the day, my favorite choice here was actually their Pub Whiskey Burger.  They made a pub whiskey sauce that was phenomenal.  Sadly, it was removed from their menu a few years ago.    The bangers and mash is normally quite good but today it was fairly blase.  The sausages themselves were okay, could have used a bit more searing.  The mash was good but not very flavorful.  The gravy had no signs of onion in it.  And normally this dish is served with either the vegetable of the day or brussels sprouts with apples.  For some odd reason, mine came with... irish chips.  Sliced, fried potatoes to accompany my already sizable portion of mashed potatoes.    Curious choice for certain.  If there had been a question as to what I wanted, they should have asked me.  Under normal circumstances I would have asked for the normal veggies or sprouts to accompany my meal, but this long into the lunch, it just didn't seem worth the fuss.    Once we left, we pretty unanimously agreed that this was likely the last group luncheon that we would be having here.  It's sad to see such a storied establishment fall into disarray and mediocrity.  I hope they can make adjustments and improve.  Taken from their website, \"Irish pubs are a retreat from the real world and at the heart of Rula Bula is the ready smile, the invitation to relax and enjoy good conversation, great food and drink, hospitality and humour.\"  This has not been our experience here in some time.  There is a lot of competition on Mill, which is only growing with the improving economy.  Robbie Fox's down the street has new ownership and will be re-opening as Public House on Third.  It also happens to be right next to our office building.  Where once we journeyed to the opposite end of Mill Avenue to patronize Rula Bula, we may find ourselves having our luncheons a bit closer to home.",

Fish and chips was one of the most expensive dissapointments I have had at a restaurant, as the fish had no flavor but looks great in the pictures. Cheese burger was passible for the price, it was good but expensive and nothing to bring in family to try.

    "text": "When my friend suggested going to an Irish pub for dinner, I instinctively responded with the two-finger air quotes; I had been to enough \"Irish\" restaurants, thanks. But after some convincing, I'm so thrilled to have finally dined at a place comparable to being back in Ireland.  The ambiance is wonderful -- no gimmicky decor, just lots of space to dine and comfortable booths to sit in. Found a leftover napkin at my feet, but I cared more about the cleanliness of the table and silverware, which was satisfactory. Our server was Lorrli, and she was an absolute delight -- treated us all like she'd treat her best friends that came in. She offered to split all our checks right up front; THANK GOD, because I spent too much time in the heat to be in the mood to do math.  I ordered the bangers and mash, and the taste wasn't too much different than the ones I had in Galway. The onion gravy was absolutely superb, the bangers were, well, bangin', and the mashed potatoes were delightfully creamy without any weird texture. I had a side of broccoli sauteed in garlic, and it was perfect -- I fought to keep the others at the table away from it. I also tried one of Boyfriend's chips, and it had a perfect crunch -- not too hard, not even soggy -- and the tartar sauce that accompanied wasn't overpowering in flavor at all. Friend ordered the cottage pie, and although I did not partake, she had zero complaints.  The next time I'm in the Tempe area, I will probably go out of my way to come here again and see what the corned beef and cabbage, boxty, and Guinness have to offer.",

He cared about my allergy and said he'll absolutely make sure there's no dairy in what i ordered (even if he wasn't positive in the moment which I'm fine with as long as he followed up which he was great about).

    "text": "Rula Bula means something along the lines of a 'fun party,' and this Irish pub didn't disappoint!  A friend and I came here after she'd heard great things about it, and I'm glad we did - Rula Bula is definitely different from the typical Mill Ave bar scene, with a slightly older crowd.  They have a good selection of beers and ciders on tap, including Magners (they have bottled pear, and apple on tap), which I hadn't had since studying abroad years ago!  They have lots of seating, both indoor and outdoor, which makes for an easy time finding a table.. just be aware that the patio is smoking-friendly though, so if you're sensitive to second-hand smoke, it might be better to sit inside.  Our server was also very friendly, and checked in with us regularly to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.    I only ordered cider while there, but my friend also got their shepherd's pie, due to the positive reviews.  Before we'd met up, she'd mentioned craving mashed potatoes, which was a good thing I guess, because the dish appeared to be about 75% potato, 25% everything else.. it was also only lukewarm when she got it, but our server was kind enough to heat it a bit more.    Overall, in terms of atmosphere and service I'd give Rula Bula a 5/5, but I took off 1 star because of my friend's dinner. If you're looking for an Irish pub, and want a different experience from the typical Mill scene, I'd recommend trying out Rula Bula :)",

However my server (Stone) was attentive and timely.  I can usually expect to wait 5-15min on the back patio before I get a menu.  Stone addressed me within 90sec and he never left me \"waiting\" the rest of the night.  He earned five stars for service.  If the rest of the staff can be this attentive, I'll continue to come here.  (Too frequently they stand and chit-chat amongst themselves.)",

As they should be. If an authentic Irish pub can't serve some solid fried fish filets, I lose quite a bit of respect for it.   The service was fine, but it's a little hard to guage from only seeing it one time during a slow afternoon. We sat outside undercover for a bit after we finished lunch and it has potential to be a great hangout area.   If I'm around Mill on St. Patty's, I will definitely be around Rula Bula.",

We are always down for something new - so I tried the Shepard's Pie.  It was really tasty - even if it was made with beef instead of lamb.  It really reminded me of food that my mother made when I was growing up - except that it was more polished.  I really did like it.  My wife really enjoyed her entree as well.  I don't recall what it's called, but it was basically stewed beef served in potato (pan)cakes.  She shared with me and I really enjoyed it as well.  Both entrees came with broccoli, which I welcome over fries, every day.  It was at the high end of what I would pay for good, fresh-made, basic home cooking.    Finally, I had no idea that the place had a large patio out back.  I have always seen it from Mill - where it looks small.  But once inside, you see that Rula has two personalities - one is a family restaurant and the other is a college bar.  I think they co-exist well here.",

Sometimes it's even good! I like live music.  They have a back patio which is way smaller than Casey's and has no Blarney Stone.  The front area is too bright and too clean but they do have some cute stuff up on the walls.  It's a great place for drinking when it's not crowded.  St. Patricks at Rula is what's the word? Oh yes. Insane.  I have never made out with a girl in the bathrooms here.   I haven't decided if that's because Rula is too classy or I'm too classy.  Perhaps a bit of both.",

But the lacking stars are for the service.  The slooooooooooow service.  From bartenders to servers, you will get your pints and food at a turtle's pace.    If you go on St. Patty's day (it's comin' up) be prepared to be packed in like little sardines because the place gets BUSY.  As does any other Irish joint, but if you want to breathe, the only place that might be possible is on the patio.  Otherwise, good luck moving in the bar and even more good luck trying to get a drink!  I wouldn't rula this place out (get it?) but I'm not so sure I'd become a regular either.",

    "text": "I went here a few weeks ago on a Friday night after I got off of work.  I guess I should start by saying that the only reason I gave this review 2 stars instead of 1 is because Rula Bula covered my friends tab the next day when he went back to settle the situation.  My friends and I had been there for about an hour before it was time for last call.  One of my friends had opened a tab, and upon attempting to pay it and retrieve his card, he was told that the system was down and that he was going to have to wait until the following morning to get his card back.  In fact, there were about 10 people still waiting at the back bar by 230 who were trying to pay their tabs and get cards back.  I had cash on me and even offered to PAY MY FRIEND'S TAB AND EVEN LEAVE A TIP, just so we could get his card back and go home!!  Then, when I explained to the manager that it was illegal for him to hold my friend's card over night, he said \"Thank you inquisitor\" and told me he didn't need a lesson in the law!  Then when I told him I did not think it was befitting of a manager to talk to a customer in his establishment that way he just dismissed me as drunk and walked off in huff and went back in the building!  At that point, an employee who was still out by the back bar even suggested that my friends and I go get a police officer to settle the issue!  I work down the street from these guys and I would never want to bring the cops into someones place like that.  However,  I can honestly say that it is because of my experience with the manager that night at Rula that I even created this Yelp account.  I will never go to that bar again.  If you want a good pub setting with a good staff go to Casey Moore's on Ash just off of University.",

    "text": "We've been here a few times before while visiting family in Arizona.  First off, let me just say the Rueben Sandwich is AWESOME.  This is what sold us on Rula Bula the first time we came here.  The 2nd time we went, we had a Rueben...and guess what the 3rd time we went, another Rueben!  Can't get enough of them I guess.   We decided that this would be a nice place for our family to go after my Dad's memorial service.  Called a few days ahead and spoke with the manager, explained the occasion and what we were looking for- somewhere that we could sit outside for a few hours, have a meal and some drinks, enjoy the beautiful weather and hang out for a while reminiscing with family.  It was indeed all that!   Our server was very good- the food was excellent (yes, we had a Rueben!)...and we also decided to split an order of fish and chips, also, very good.  We ended up hanging out for about 2 1/2 hours.  They never rushed us to get out and they even separated the checks between all the different groups of family.  Most places put up a stink if asked to make separate checks, however, Rula Bula did not.  They were very accommodating and friendly. Did I mention that they also have Guinness 250 on tap here?  Another plus! The only qualms I had about our visit is that I was a little disappointed how the tables were set up for our party.  They were split into 2 tables, and it would have been nice to have them grouped into one large table.  Instead we all just kept shifting seats in order to visit with different members of the family...no biggie I guess.   I would recommend this place to anyone looking to have a great meal, a good drink, in a laid-back atmosphere.  I'll definably come here again, next time, for Rueben #4!!! :)",

And the bar's food has never really wowed me. But if you want something different then the usual \"Girls Gone Wild\" bars that line Mill Avenue, this is your place.

Guiness is Guiness no matter where you get it.  I thought the food was lousy. I had the Shepherd's Pie, and I sent it back.

Don't expect the best service, but don't expect the worst either. As for the food- WOW. I love the irish nachos, and the artichoke and cheese dip is phenomenal. Not to mention the fish & chips. The only thing that ruins it is the prices. I know they rack it up because it is a college town and frequency + prices = High profit... However, it kind of sucks when I only come in twice a month and my tab is always around $60 for a beer and some food with a friend. I have never seen a manager in this place with my own two eyes, but I'm sure they are lurking somewhere. Rula Bula is 'ok' in my book, but if I'm hungry I will eat before I come here.",

The place was busy, nice bar area up front and the dinning section is located further back. The menu is all Irish type meals. Something I'm very familiar with growing up having these dishes and being half Irish. So much to choose from and had a hard time deciding. Menu has so much to offer: including all the staples of a home cooked Irish traditional meal! Started with a great appetizer : seasoned potato balls that are deep fried & served with ranch and buffalo sauce- YUM!! The potato nacho's are gigantic and should be eaten as a meal. Serves at least 3-4 people! I had the corn beef sandwich and requested it wrap in a flour tortilla, it was delicious. My husband had a burger that came with bacon and a fried egg on top. One of the best burgers he has ever had! He ordered a few pairings of beers along with that, that went well & he enjoyed! You won't leave hungry with their portions. I feel a little expensive, but with the amount of food, presentation & atmosphere- well worth it. You have to try this place- amazing! Owner stopped by our table and inquired about our meal. Pleasant, friendly and told us some history of the restaurant. It's also indicated on their menu that the building was actually put together in Ireland and brought to the U.S. That's pretty cool!

Upon arrival we were informed that there is a $5 cover charge per person just to enter the building and eat lunch regardless if you're not drinking neither one of us drink. We are extremely disappointed. How greedy can an owner be does he need that much money to make $10 extra on every person or a couple that walks in. True example of greed. How much money does a person need to make. Are they needing money so bad that they have to figure out a way to make extra money without having quality food. Just a question totally disappointed in the owners greed. If I could rate it -10 I would.",

So I'd assume the time it took he would have gotten it correct  I get the order, take it home only to discover no burger and fries. Great and i live too far to just come back to get the cold food.  So he agrees to refund my whole order back to my credit card. Well a week later and STILL no refund back. So will now have to file a dispute.",

I tried a second one and found it also lacked vodka. Maybe the bartender drank the vodka?",

But my friends ordered the Beef Shepherd's pie and the Mac Attack and they enjoyed their dishes. So it seems like I probably ordered the  one of their mediocre items on the menu. Ambiance & service was decent - we were a group of 5 and we were in and out of the place in 1 hour. I plan on going back some day and trying out other items on their menu before I completely rule this place out. And yes - this place is conveniently located  next to a metered parking lot. Be sure to call this place before you go there to get a 2 hour free parking code - the code they have given in their online menu does not work.",

    "text": "Over the last year, I've noticed a rapid decline in the quality of service at Rula Bula. It used to be my favorite place to wash away my college woes, but now I don't ever want to go back.  On a Friday night in May I was out celebrating a friend's birthday with a group of 10-12 people. We were all ordering food, booze and overall having an excellent time. When time comes to mosey on home, the waitress informs me that my credit card has been lost. Problem #1: If a guest's credit card is lost, a manager should always come discuss this with the guest, not the server.  The waitress, Maddie, was horrified and worried, and suggested I leave my phone number with her so if she found it she could call me. She also gave me a comped beer, which I later found out wasn't comped but a beer she paid for herself. True True to her word I received a phone call shortly after close that night. For a variety of reasons, I was unable to pick up my card for a few days. Because of this Rula Bula put a pending charge on my credit card for $25 because my card was \"left overnight\".  Problem #2: management. In conversing with the manager via email, I received excuses, and was told several times that I was wrong about the credit card charges about which I complained, even after verifying them multiple times with my card company. In my emails I also listed several shortcomings I had noticed regarding the level of service, and received absolutely no input from the manager.  There's no excuse for poor service, lost cards, non-comped drinks after such an egregious mistake, and no real apology. The managers really don't seem to care, which is an attitude that rubs off on many of the employees, save for Maddie.   I'm sad to say goodbye to the best Guinness in town, but I simply can't keep justifying the poor service and lack of concern for customer satisfaction.",

I never had it and I've seen it in cooking shows before. The fact you can add cheese on top makes it richer. The meat filling has some carrots, peas, and onions. I tasted red wine in there to make  that meat filling rich. The mashed potato was buttery and soft. I felt like I don't need sides whenever I eat it but if I'm drinking  some alcohol, its necessary.  My friends order a bunch of stuff like the  BBQ chicken sandwich and Gaelic Chicken. They both said their dishes were amazing and chicken was moist. I haven't explored more on the alcohol but their backyard is the best place to be with friends and having a good time.   I can see myself comeback here again. Food is delicious and a good place to get drinks with friends!",

    "text": "If you like Jameson, Guinness, and a bit of friendly drunken shenanigans, then come on in and experience the warm and inviting Irish pub known as Rula Bula. It's decor is inspired by vintage saddles and wood stables and the building itself has been around since the early developments of the infamous Mill Ave.  Had the Big Breakfast and I was blown away how good it was. Heavenly! Our bartender was awesome and gave us suggestions on what to try.  We left feeling light-hearted and buzzed haha!  The name may be funny, but this place means business when it comes to offering a legit Irish pub spot with good food.",

    "text": "This pub is awesome! One of my friends, who has been to Ireland, vouches for this establishment's, \"authenticity for an American Irish Pub\". Everything was clean, everyone was friendly and the ambiance/decor reflected Ireland.  I had a dinner salad and the Irish Lamb Stew, both were delicious but the portions were on the small side - I recommend ordering an appetizer if you're hungry. (They use shallow bowls so the food appears larger/more than it is). Furthermore, the Irish Lamb Stew I ordered during this visit only had 2 pieces of lamb, the rest was potatoes and carrots. They have a terrific menu - the best thing to do is to check their website for their most current offerings: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frulabula.com&s=ec7cbc56d92b4f28b45f9975258d041488bab56223bdd8fbf607aa9411d7d497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">rulabula.com</a>  During this visit, the server's name was Stone and he did a fantastic job! Stone told me about the live music there at the pub. On Tuesday nights from 9:00 PM to Midnight, it's open mic - any type of music is played. Sunday afternoon offers any type of live music from 3:00-5:00 PM.  For newcomers, I recommend paying to park in the parking lot next to the pub, the reason is, the later it gets the crazier people get. The only other option is the limited street parking. This establishment is close to Arizona State University, ASU, and things go from 1 to 11 QUICK on a Friday, Saturday or Holiday! The parking is cheap and easy. It runs about $2.00 per hour and they have kiosks that take credit/debit cards. I usually get between 2-4 hours worth of parking.   I +LOVE+ IRISH PUBS! The term, \"Pub\" is short for, \"Public House\" and in Ireland - it's an institution! It's not just a place to get a drink, meal, watch sports, hear music or meet people - but a part of the local community!  Unlike most contemporary U.S. institutions, night clubs or hot-spots, a good-old Irish Pub allows a young lad or lass to FULLY ENJOY THEMSELVES! Have a couple pints, enjoy the food, music and DUMP the POLITICAL CORRECTNESS! Let your hair down and relax! Celebrate cultural diversity by singing along! (I'm +SO TIRED+ of the tight-@ss PC police!) Live a little!!!  Lastly, here's the meaning of their name taken from their website:  \"[W]e decided on Rula Bula. Taken from the Irish Gaelic language expression \"ri ra agus ruaille buaille\" it translates to \"uproar and commotion\" in the context of a celebratory and fun time. We phoneticized the expression into Rula Bula to simplify pronunciation in English. We felt Rula Bula was an appropriate selection for the upbeat, fun image the City of Tempe portrays. Particularly on Mill Avenue, which is often, open only to foot traffic during the many festivities that take place throughout the year.\"  I rate this establishment, with all things in this review considered, a solid 5 stars!",

Of course we had several excellent beers which were all great but the best part of our visit was the fish-and-chips. I'm gonna have to come back here again because the fish-and-chips was so darn good. I've had fish-and-chips at other Irish and English pubs in the Phoenix area but nothing and I mean nothing like what they serve here.   The fish was fresh tasty and crispy and the chips were out of this world amazing.  The service is great and the people are friendly and I will be will be back for more for sure.",

The wings are a respectable size and tasty.  My Scotish friend visiting from Buffalo New York gave the wings an 8 out of 10. As a side note he did mention that they would never serve them with ranch dressing in Buffalo which is how they are offered on the menu here, they serve them with blue cheese but that's an easy fix, just tell them if you want blue! Did I mention they have beer! I love all the combinations you can order like the black and tan, 50/50 and my fave the Dirty Scotsman, half Guinness half kilt lifter.  They also have a grip of whiskeys to choose from.",

Although I wasn't a huge fan of my dryer-than-the-desert Mac and cheese grilled cheese, or my soggier-than-the-school-cafeteria's Brussels sprouts, the excellent service and cozy pub-style ambiance made this a memorable and enjoyable visit. Overall, I wouldn't necessarily recommend the food for a nice dinner spot, but if you're stopping in primarily for drinks and perhaps a snack, you're sure to have a good time!",

The manager assured me it was a brand new clean glove that fell onto the plate because it stuck to the chef's gloved hand. Is the chef blind? Is his name Simpson? What about a diner's potential latex allergy or a potential intestinal blockage from biting off a finger? At that point the manager comped my $8.95 shrimp starter and covered my Miller Lite beer too. What a guy!  It'll take more than that cheap comp to get me back into Rula Bula. Too bad --  I used to go in there for dinner about six times a year with a group of friends before we hit the plays at Gammage. Back then I would have given it a 5-star review.

Everything on the menu here looked really good which made choosing a single thing difficult. After some deliberation I went with the Guinness and Beef Pie and a Hemingway Daqueri.  The beef pie was simple but tasty and filling. You get this lovely dish of tender beef hidden under a fluffy puff pastry and a choice of a side. This time the side of choice was garlic roasted broccoli and it did not disappoint.  The drink I got was tasty as well though I regret eating the cherry that came with it immediately. Rookie mistake.  My friend's also enjoyed their food and drink, looking forward to returning again to try more dishes.",

Thought the odds were in my favor as I found street parking right out front.  We were seated in in the table closest the window on the dining room side - nice views of the room.  We started with leek & potato soup & I ordered the fish and chip lunch.  I liked the lightness of the coating on the fish.   The soup was a bit thinner than I would like, but it had good flavor.    All in my lunch was $21 w/tip.  I was a bit dismayed to find two charges on my credit card this morning - one for the correct amount and another for double the charge.  I've worked in restaurants and I understand that some systems add more to the bill for various reasons.  The charge is eventually reversed, but as a previous reviewer noted, why should the customer have to pursue this matter with their bank?  Current circumstances dictate keeping a close watch on finances right now and honestly, I don't have $40 that can be tied up indefinitely (since it's Friday, there's no guarantee this matter will be resolved by end of business today (5pm) which means this will spill over into the holiday weekend.   Very disappointing *Responding to comment:  In the last two years this is the only restaurant that this has happened at. One item I had forgotten about was the server telling us the system was down in the dining room so she had to go run the card in back.  I don't know if she had tried it up front.  Yes, both charges are showing as pending, but the money is still being held until the one charge falls off.  I appreciate your managers verifying charges - that was one of my jobs when I worked at Margaritaville.  Years ago Am Ex used to hold a higher amount than the charge to allow for the tips & adjustments.  I'm not aware TCF on which my card is from, having a similar policy, but I will contact them.",

The drink order was taken and filled quickly. We ordered our meals and they came in a timely manner as well. The BLT Salad was very good, basic, but fresh and plentiful. The Turkey Wrap was very yummy with a wonderful sauce. The Sweet Potato Fries we received were stone cold. Our waitress brought us some piping hot replacements in no time. The Chicken Sandwich was yummy. One of us ordered the Fish and Chips...the fish was also stone cold. We did not know this until later that night, as our friend never sends his food back, and will not complain. I heard this and was pissed! I would have had that taken care of on the spot. Plus we sent the fries back and he knew that. Oh well. The patio is awesome and it is always crowded.",

(heart) circle K kay..! ya know.  anyways so walked up and down mill scoffing at the people looking to get fucked up. i blew up AmyD on the cell saying we would catch up with her at the sets or yucca tap room...  ended up walking back to the Rula and grabbed a couple drinks. umm. yea. this place isn't really great or anything.  just kinda like all the rest of the \"bars\" on mill. just irish stylized. i've been here plenty of times before and never thought to myself...\"wow what a great irish bar\". meh. it's kinda like a themed college bar and nothing more. oh well. grabbed a couple blue moons and bizounced. threw a middle finger to mill as we jumped on the \"trolly\" and busted ass back to PHX screaming \"602\"",

    "text": "My ex was 100% Irish and as the dutiful wife, I spent a lot of time learning the ins and outs of Irish Cooking. Well that relationship ended years ago, but my love affair with good Irish cuisine has never faded.   There are a few things on the menu that are a bit Americanized, however there are some stellar examples of this simple yet tasty food.  *As Kerstin M. says, their Boxty selections are always solid. The Beef and Guinness is wonderful, but the daily offerings are sure to please as well.  *The Bangers and Mash is a wonderful combination of their handmade Irish sausage with Ulster Champs (think lumpy mashed potatoes with green onion and herbs... one of my personal favorites).  *The Guinness and Onion Soup is fabulous. I crave this in the winter months and have actually tried substituting Guinness for Brandy when I make the stuff at home! It's a nice twist on the traditional French Onion; melty cheese dripping down over the sides of the crock. *Once I was there and they were serving traditional Colcannon which is mashed potatoes with kale or cabbage and some additional spices. I can't remember if this was around Halloween, but they had the little \"prizes\" inside and everything (thankfully the waiter warned us). But what fun!!!  Remember to get your fix of fresh Soda Bread and if you are like me, wash it all down with a couple of pints and Black and Tans!  I've actually held several work events here and as they aren't quite as busy for lunch, they are the perfect destination for something a little different (normally they don't take reservations, but I've never had a problem with calling ahead and making arrangements for my group).  Rula Bula has a few detractors, but I say to them Pog mo thoin! and slainte as I order another round!!!",

It was actually my first culinary experience when I moved to the valley 7 years ago. I was skeptical, as Irish pubs don't typically have a great deal to offer vegetarians (which I was at the time... now I eat fish, which opens up the menu a bit), but Rula Bula's got a few really tasty veggie options, including veggie potato skins, vegetarian shepherd's pie (that's right - never seen that anywhere else, and oh so delicious), and the four-cheese grilled sandwich. I prefer to go for lunch or dinner, as the place gets a little college kid crowded rowdy the later it gets. Yeah, I know - I'm old.",

In a town like Boston, or NYC, this would be 2 stars, but in Phoenix, it's one of the few Irish pubs you can go to, that is somewhat authentic (authentic meaning Guinness owns these, and Guinness is made in Ireland, so hence this is an Irish pub) .   It feels like home, from the Boston bartenders, to the Red Sox fans that seem to flock there. The prices are good, the food is surprisingly good, and they have a great staff. They have live music on the weekends, with a small cover, and bartender selected music the other nights( which can be terrible, depending on who is spinning). The patio is really quaint and secluded from Mill St.  When it's not hots as nuts out most people hang out here. They do have misters, so don't wear your glasses outside if it's misty season. My only problem, is one of location. Mill St. for the post college folk, can be annoying. You have a lot of options in the terms of bars, but this is one of the few worth going into. It seems to attract and older crowd, and  the ASU students that are mature and just looking to chill. It's mellow and not college-y at all. (new word) If you like the Irish Pub feeling, this place is rather cool.",

There's as many varieties of Irish beer as one can drink.  The real key to Rula Bula is the nooks.  Something that few bars have managed to do right in this town is nooks.  My favorite spot is just inside the front door, off to your right as you walk in.  I've spent many a night huddled with too many friends around the tiny table there.    There's a large stage that generally features good Celtic bands of one stripe or another.  Pints average five bucks a piece which is respectable enough for Mill Ave.    Rula Bula, without a doubt is the bar that reminds me most of my time in Galway with a happy, open atmosphere, plenty of room for chatting up strangers and nooks aplenty.",

It always seems to be the case and 2, the food is ok, nothing spectacular.  With that being said it actually is a really cool bar.  It has a psuedo authenticity to it that makes you feel like you're in Ireland they have great live Irish music.  That is always a positive.  I find the beer selection to be pretty good and the vibe to be pretty good as well.  Although not the best Irish bar I have ever been to (I am from Boston) it's definitely the best Irish bar I have been to in Arizona, and one of my top 2 spots on Mill Ave.",

Rula Bula does not at all fit in with the trashy bars and overall poor restaurant selection on Mill Ave. It is a diamond in the rough, and it consistently transports me into a lively Irish pub, filled with authentic decorations and very very good food and drinks. I am not a fan of beer, but I am a fan of this place. Get the chicken pot pie or bangers and mash. You will not regret it. Love this place!",

The table next to us seemed to have no trouble getting them tobring their drinks however. Perhaps they were friends with the staff?  I've been here for dinner before as well and while the food is decent I'm not overly impressed. Having been to my fair share of Irish pubs in Ireland this is not a good representation. It is definately an American idea of an Irish pub and it is appropriately overpriced for the \"tourists\". I'll go to the pub down the street for better service and a True Irish feel from now on.",

The Bartender, Steve, was friendly and informative.  Everyone should stop in when on Mill St. in Tempe and have a Guinnes.  Slainte!!!!",

    "text": "Went to Rula on an ASU football game Friday.  I don't think they put an ounce of thought into their business levels or needs of their customers.  I get there and the front entrance is closed off and there is a sign that says to use another entrance.  The arrow pointed in one direction but the entrance was actually in the back so there's one fail for directing traffic.  I finally get to the back entrance and it's understandably busy.  The bar on the patio is swamped so I expected to wait a minute to put in a drink order.  I stood there for 5 minutes (timed) and it wasn't until a female friend of mine walked over (didn't wave or draw attention to herself, just simply walked up) that we were acknowledged and asked what we needed.  Coincidence?  Not sure and I don't care!  We get our drinks and when it was time for round 2, I waited 9, yes, 9 minutes to order.  Again, same friend walked up and viola, \"what can I get you guys?\".  The bartenders seemed friendly enough but they had ZERO sense of urgency and apparently had some fixation with the right side of the bar because they were helping existing and new customers over there while I waited.  One guy (older) who was bartending and was moving at a snail's pace.  This held up the other guys from pouring their drinks so to pass the time along, they were all joking around with each other instead of acknowledging their customers (yours truly) and letting us know it would be a minute.  Laughable.  Another couple were waiting and discussing how bad the service was as well.  They got so irritated they ordered their drinks, slammed them down and left.  If you're looking for a low key place to get a drink, I would only recommend this spot if it's dead slow or if every other bar on Mill is closed!  PASS!",

The patio is awesome, the music is not too loud so its great to go with a group and hang out and have a conversation while drinking, I love it. I also think their prices are reasonable and the selection of beer and whiskey is good too. My major point of contention is having to pay cover, yes I know the last time I went I only had to fork over two dollars, but that just makes me ask \"why two dollars? do they really need to shake me down for the extra few bucks?\" I hate paying cover to frequent an establishment Here is an idea, why dont I start a restaurant and just to walk in the door I charge 10 bucks. Ohhhh?? Thats crazy you say? Then bars need to stop this insane practice. (exception is bars doing a crazy drink special like penny bladder busters or a band is playing, a real band, I am not referring to the mediocrity I have seen at rula bula in the past)",

    "text": "I changed jobs a few months ago and am now working in the Mill Ave area. Once again (previously at Old Town Scottsdale) I find myself writing about cool bars with tons of reviews containing details of fun nights on the town from the perspective of a working stiff grabbing a quick bite on her lunch break. Oh, well, c'est la vie!  First off, I was expecting a kind of dingy dive bar but the interior is actually quite nice looking. I liked all the little Irish knick-knacks they had around the place. And even though there were a couple of signs advertising whiskey and Guinness, there weren't a ton of neon signs everywhere... so during the day, the place really does not scream \"college bar!\" at all. The seating was comfortable and I liked that there was both an open area where you could push some tables together for a large group and also an area separated by a couple stairs with some semi-private booths. Our server was friendly and attentive and the food came out really quick.  I ordered the strawberry salad because I knew I was having a big dinner later that evening and I didn't want to fill up. Surprisingly, instead of the boring iceberg lettuce you would expect from a bar salad they had a nice spring mix. The strawberries were very fresh and the grilled chicken was cooked perfectly. All the flavors worked really well together and the only criticism I have is that the dressing was a tad too sweet. Overall, a really tasty salad. My fellow lunch companions ordered a burger, fish and chips, and shepherd's pie. All of their plates looked really good and they all enjoyed their food. I will definitely order the shepherd's pie next time since this is a favorite dish of mine and they serve a nice small lunch portion that you can get with a salad to keep the meal from being too heavy.  Hopefully I'll get to try this place for a few drinks in the evening some time but until then I will definitely be back for lunch.",

I've been to a number of cities a round the world and the one thing I'm almost always certain to find, is an Irish bar, and Rula Bula is a wonderful example of what they are like when they are done right. In addition, I don't know how long it has been in its current location, in the historical Andre building, which was built in the lat 1800s, but it has been around at least almost 20 years, since I've been living in Phoenix and the food and the quality of the adult beverages have stayed remarkably consistent.  I'm not a huge fan of Irish food but this place does fish and chips quite well and they know how to pour a Guiness right and when the weather is nice nothing beats the outdoor seating area. Oh, and did I mention the establishment is in sight distance of the third street and Mill Avenue light rail station?   I don't do the late nights like I used to when I was younger but over the years I've had some fun times in Rula Bula and if you are young and want a fun place to have a few drinks and hang out with friends, I don't think you can go wrong with a place like Rula Bula.",

Even though our family avoids the over-congested, over-hyped Mill Ave circus like the plague, we decided that Irish food is what we had a hankering for. I knew that Rula Bula had great Yelp reviews and it was close to the ASU art museum we planned on visiting. I had the Bistro Filet Medallions ($9) and my daughter had the Irish Stew ($8). Her 2 year old son had the fish and chips kids meal ($6). My daughter also had the Magners Cider. Overall the food was good, but I was a little surprised by the whiskey-peppercorn gravy on my meat and mashed potatoes. When they say whiskey, they are not kidding. This is the first time I have ever had a gravy with vapor-action!  Pros: Good food, nice Irish pub vibe, and a misted patio that would be nice if it weren't in full sun on a 105 degree day with 45% humidity.  Cons: Parking, parking, parking. There is no parking lot for this restaurant. There is a pay-$2-per-hour lot next door to the restaurant. That means that we will not be making a return visit to this establishment. The valley has way too many restaurant options to put up with being gouged for parking.",

Great beer selection and menu options with some very solid Irish Pub style dishes being offered.  I had the fish and chips which was very good.  Several in the group ordered other traditional Irish fare and all were pleased with the choice.  Had a couple in the group with solid Irish heritage and they even commented that they were supposed at how good the dishes were.

And, it's kept all of the same 'charm' to remind us (whether we like to or not) of all of the crazy times back in college and even the times after we graduated when acted like we were still enrolled.  Rula Bula tries to hold True to its Irish theme from everything on the menu to the band that will get you dancing a jig faster than a couple pints of Guinness. The patio is also a fun spot, but get there early to find a seat. I've always found people to be friendly and willing to share a barrel where you can rest your drinks. Don't forget to order a few Irish Car Bombs and sip on some Jameson. In fact, Rula Bula even looks like pub you might stumble upon in Dublin!  Slainte!",

That was my first good experience there. So naturally I went back. Landed at the bar inside this time & at happy hour. Me & my PIC consumed some HH concoctions but moved on for dinner else where because neither of us felt like partaking in anything too heavy. But still had a good drink at HH & helpful staff tending the bar. The 3rd time was on a gorgeous Saturday night. We were in Tempe for an event at the lake. So we tried the patio bar for HH food & $1 off beers on tap. The sliders we tried were good & the beer cold. This place is A-Ok but I'm gonna have to just come in starving to try the food sometime soon. Everything that went by looked tasty. Stay tuned.",

The guy in the fedora who goes to other bars and gets asked \"Hey, aren't you the regular over at Rula?\" I'm also kind of biased, but i'm a Guiness fan. and I'm a cider fan. And Rula trained its bartenders on how to pour the perfect Snakebite (Yep, its Guiness and Cider, layerd. The Cider floats on the Guiness. Its neat-o!).   Ok, So. Rula. Probably has the largest back patio on Mill Ave, and on the weekends, it gets fill to the brim with every kind of stereotype that exists in the greater Phx area. Frat Boys mix with Foreign Exchange Students mix with Old Fogey's mix with Hipsters. And everyone gets along pretty much. When the occasional fight breaks out (as drunkards are wont to hit someone/thing at some point), Security breaks it up and gets the problem cleared away. Also, as its a large back patio with many tables, chairs, and people, and its a bar, people are going to be smoking. Cigars and cig's abound, and ashtrays as well.  If you don't want to be bothered by the smokers, feel free to meander through the crowd, back inside where, all the while on Friday and Saturday nights, there is really good live music playing (which, by the way, is who the 2$ cover to get in goes to). And for the most part, everyone gets along.  In the realm of food, Rula has the Irish fare down pat. The Boddington's Shrimp, the shepard's pie, the boxty, all are amazing, and decently priced. Don't come here and expect to order nachos and a second rate burger to add some flavor to your Coors and Bud Light's. They have real good food with real good beers. The servers are all friendly and quick, the management is pretty chill, and the over all feel of the place is relaxed. Its hard to feel tense while hanging out here.  Oh, and don't try to order beer from the bar back out back.  He's just so happens to be the best bar-back this side of the Mississippi, and keeps the outdoor bar running in top shape, but, trust me, as much as he wants to get you a beer and back amongst the masses, the poor guy is not allowed, no matter how much you bitch about it or how much money you try to throw at him. Wait for one of the bartenders, they'll gladly help you shortly.",

You get our little family outing to Rula Bula.  This place was great, and did an amazing job of serving our 8 person goat rodeo when we all went out as a family for dinner one Saturday night.   Food was great, drinks were free flowing and constantly topped off, and the waiter didn't start throwing things at a group that it would be a euphemism to call \"hard to serve.\"   The poor server should have known he was in for a festival of special when six of the eight of us were sitting outside due to one of the elders of the tribe insisting that 108* \"wasn't that hot\" and then continued to be grouchy because it wasn't significantly cooler inside. He was wrong about this, and I think the man might be part lizard, but we won out.   Only ding, like Sarah said before me, was the heat. Thankfully I was drinking beer, which cools my soul and warms my heart, so I was able to soldier through another family outing with our brigade.   Thanks Rula Bula, you handled your business in what could have been real nightmare.",

We were able to secure a table and enjoy our beer in the warm Arizona air.  Eventually, a waitress did take orders from us which was great.  This place was neat.  I think we stayed until close?  Pretty cool place to check out.  Would love to try the food here sometime!

We probably ordered  our food about 10 minutes after we had all been seated. First off, the waitress didn't even get my order of a root beer correct and instead brought me Sprite (which I don't mind, but that's what you get when your waitress doesn't write down orders). Then she comes to us about 15 minutes later saying that the receipt that had printed out didn't get everyone's order so she had to come back to our table to find out two of the orders (again, what happens when you don't write down the orders...). After about an hour of us sitting around with no food she comes up to my father to let him know that she was just informed that there was no cod left. At the point we told the waitress that we had to leave in order to get to Gammage in time. That was probably the worst service I had ever experienced. Whatever is going on in the kitchen needs to be fixed. I am super hesitant to go back in case this happens again. I was really hoping to try a burger with pretzel bread. Guess I'll just stick to Casey Moore's. Atleast I can get a sandwich there much quicker.",

    "text": "\"There are good ships, and there are wood ships - the ships that sail the sea. But the best ships - are friendships - and may they always be.\"  How can you begin a review of an Irish pub without an old Irish blessing? Let me start by saying, Rula Bula is the most understated bar on Mill Ave. Amongst the cherry pits, taverns and middle-aged somethings lurking at The Library Bar (why is that, anyway?) Rula Bula is like a big warm bear hug. The usually have a pretty steady lunch and dinner crowd - it could stand as a restaurant in its's own rite - fish and chips are not as greasy as some, and the potato \"rounds\" are perfect. My favorite is the Vegetarian Shepards Pie, but @ $10-$15 per meal we don't eat here frequently. BUT we do drink here frequently!    Around 9 or 10pm they have live live music every weekend. This is THE ONLY spot on Mill that you can find live, good local music. The bands change every night - but my local favorites are Shawn Johnson and the Foundation (a perfect blend of Hootie meets Sublime meets your favorite cover songs) and the Irish band that always plays there (I have no idea their name!) but they really bring down the house. Between 11 PM - 2 AM the band really creates a sort of \"collective\" atmosphere - everyone that is inside dancing (or jigging) to the music.   The crowd is the perfect blend of young college kids, late twenty-somethings and an older crowd. It has a great neighborhood, eclectic feel.   The drinks are average price - roughly $5 bucks for a mixed drink and $3 for a beer. My favorite is a Snakebite (which is 1/2 cider - which they have on tap- with 1/2 Guiness). If you like a lighter beer, try the Snakebite w/ Harp instead.   Like many of the other reviews have stated, they have a huge outdoor patio area (great if you aren't into the music and want something a bit more low-key).  Living in Phoenix 8 years, I have never been to a bar that makes me feel this good.",

    "text": "Don't tell my husband I'm giving Rula Bula 3 stars.  He thinks it deserves 4.  But he should try earning his little Elite badge and write his own review I say.  After Zoolights fell through on Saturday night (not interested in walking from a parking lot in Chandler to get there), we found ourselves on Mill, which is actually only the 2nd time I've ever been on Mill.  My husband, on the other hand, had too many months unsupervised in the Valley before I joined him, and has apparently visited many of these fine establishments, including Rula Bula.  Not being a huge fan of Irish food, or beer for that matter, I decided this would be the 1 in 100 dining experiences I let him choose.  I loved  the interior I must say.  And the menu is not so bad either.  If I could find quesadillas and hot wings in Ireland, I might just visit.  But so as to not completely humiliate my husband, I ordered a cider, rather than a margarita, and fish 'n chips.  The cider was perfect, not too sweet.  If only beer should taste this good...  The fish (cod) was perfectly cooked and the batter was flavorful.  I just wish it was a little more crispy.  Perhaps it didn't hold up to my splash of vinegar.  The chips were near perfect, except I wish the fish hadn't been plopped on top as it caused them to lose their crispiness, too.  I would be happy to come back to Rula Bula again.  They have a great patio with a bar out there as well.  But I think I'll stick to the time of year when ASU is not in session.  I have a sneaking suspicion this place is a different beast when school starts back up.",

    "text": "Came here on Easter based on the recommendations of friends for their Fish & Chips (for my mumsie).  I had been here a few times before, but only had appetizers and drinks.    Mom liked the fish & chips, said it tasted like a tempura batter, I don't like fish so I didn't try them to know.  The chips here are awesome...they're cut like a really thick potato chip which I ordered as an appetizer, but wouldn't have had I known those were the same type of \"chips\" coming with my mom's meal.  The tartar sauce, I'm sure is made in -house so it does have dill in it, which it looked like the fish batter did also.  I didn't care for the tartar sauce but mums didn't oppose it.    Also I was asked if I wanted the appetizer chips to come out first, which I did because we were starving, but everything came out at the same time.  So for $6, it's a good appetizer, but not when you're already getting it with your meal.  The lunch sized portion was just right with 2 good sized pieces of fish, a side of cole slaw, and the chips for $9 (served before 4:00pm).  The chips also come with this delicious sauce which I would kind of describe as a fancier version of 1000 island.  Delicious!  I ordered the Shepherd's Pie, which I was somewhat apprehensive about after reading the reviews, but I thought it was pretty good.  It lacked salt, but I'd rather something lack salt and be able to add more than vice versa.  The presentation was absolutely marvelous, and the potatoes on top were to die for.  It was served with a side salad, also a lunch special for $9. I could have substituted \"chips\" for the salad if I wanted, which, again, I would have done had realized what I was doing.    Service was fairly quick, which it should have been as we were one of about 3 tables in the whole place, and our server was very friendly.  The Guiness brownie looked tempting, but I had a Snake-bite with lunch and that always makes me too full to even finish my meal.    All in all, a decent meal and I would definitely return again, but based on the fish and chips alone, Mums and I decided we're going to try another place next time.",

I also really love that I get free drinks, often, but I think its just the red hair. Seriously, red heads in Irish pubs.. I could tell stories for days..  Its not exactly your model Irish pub, but they have a decent happy hour, yummy menu options, lots of space and a sweet patio with an outdoor bar. The only real downfall here is the douchey dudes that are always here and that it is always retardedly packed after 8pm. Otherwise, its all good. Seriously subtract that and add a mechanical Bull or something equally obnoxious, and I'm a fan for life.",

Drinks and a night out, mid-day for lunch, mid-week for dinner, trivia, live music... yes!   I truly love the fish & chips, but I've also enjoyed their burgers, Dublin chicken & Farmhouse chicken sandwiches, Shepherd's pie, chicken pot pie, St. Peter's Fish & the Gaelic-style chicken breast which is my go-to. The food is substantial and delicious.   I always walk out thinking I need to go back asap. :-)",

In terms of service, one waiter was really nice but we were passed around to different waiters and I can't say that the others were helpful at all.  My recommendation would be - don't eat here.",

Then, three days in advance of St. Patrick's they call us and tell us they can't honor the reservations. The excuse they gave was that they shouldn't have made them in the first place. I bet, though, that they made and/or honored reservations for plenty of their regular customers. Easier to dump the out of towners than honor their reservations.",

Ordered the corn beef melt sandwich. It took longer than usual. I did not see a lot of people, but who knows? Got our lunches. The bread was toasted so it was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The corn beef was good (no salty). The swiss cheese melted perfectly on the corn beef. The potatoes are yummy.

Lightly battered, perfectly fried. The chips were different but complimentary to the meal.   They also had several cider beers on tap (my favorite). When I asked which beer I should try, the waitress offered bringing a sample of each so that I could know the beer before I committed to a pint. Great service!  The outdoor patio is great for parties. If it's cold, they have heaters during the winter. Summer has sprinklers. They've got live entertainment inside on weekends and also trivia nights. If you're looking for a place to hang that is casual and fun, try Rula Bula.",

I had a Stella and Joan an Irish coffee...  Kate was our server and handled our group well - she did a good job considering so many peeps arriving at different times and paying separately.  Only one discrepancy that I overheard but it wasn't too big a deal...  The bathroom was pretty filthy and the TP was out in one stall while the door wouldn't shut on another - not a fan of nasty bathrooms in restaurants.  Enjoyable pub atmosphere and convenient location on Mill Ave just off the Light Rail.  Although we didn't eat during our visit, I was impressed with the selection on the menu and based on the positive reviews that came before mine, I would totally be open to returning to eat sometime.  I'll update then!",

Both expierinces were so pleasant I thought it high time to yelp it.   Happy hour was great. Our bartender was attentive and funny and made sure to come around before last call. They have some great apps on special, chicken fingers, skewers, potato skins ect.   Their lunch menu features weekly specials, so there is always some thing new and different to try. I went there with a group of 5 ladies and we everyone was happy with their choice. I had the grilled cheese on marble rye (with tomato and 4 types of cheese this sandwich is delicious), I have tried the boxtys, potato pies, bangers and mash, french dip and salmon - all great. Our dining experience was enjoyable last week mainly do to our server (Nathan?). He split our bill without being asked and had boxes and change before we finished eating. When you're on a lunch break, not having to wait around at the end of your meal is a big plus.   Rula Bula has a great outdoor patio, fun pub atmosphere, excellent Irish pub food and is located right off the Light Rail.  You can't go wrong.",

At 11am a gentleman started turning on the neon signs in the window.  We entered the restaurant at 11:05 enjoying the a/c.  There wasn't anyone at the hostess stand so we went to sit at the bar.  The people in the kitchen made eye contact but never sent anyone out to seat us or serve us.  After a very long 8 minutes we left the restaurant.  With all the staff in the restaurant not one person could come out front to say, \"we'll be with you in a minute\"...  The two stars were for the a/c which was so refreshing.",

    "text": "I went to Rula Bula for brunch for the first time yesterday morning. I went with a big group of friends - 14, to be exact. We made a reservation, so they knew ahead of time how many of us would be there. We also told them ahead of time that we would be requiring separate checks. They were understaffed, clearly, because our poor waitress was overwhelmed. This was definitely a problem as we began ordering food and drinks. It's irritating to call in advance and give a heads up regarding some of the more complicated aspects of our party, in hopes of making the experience easier for everyone, only for the staff to be under prepared. Obviously, it took quite a bit of time for us to get our food. When we did get it, the food was lukewarm, or in some cases cold. While I understand the desire to serve the food all at once, I would rather they have served us a little at a time. We were never given the option of choosing. At the end, separating the checks turned out to be a disaster. After our waitress separated the checks, there was one mimosa unaccounted for - she couldn't remember who ordered it - so she tacked it onto someone's check. When the person stated to the waitress that she hadn't ordered the mimosa, the waitress responded and said that someone had to pay for it and she couldn't remember who ordered it. There was no attempt to figure it out, just an assumption that adding it to another person's ticket was acceptable. IT WAS NOT. I understand that being saddled with 14 guests at one table is difficult, but charging someone for an item they didn't purchase and justifying it in that way was not ok. The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because the food was good. The French toast is incredible and I would definitely recommend it. But Rula, you gotta step up your serving game.",

But that is just a given when it comes to Mill ave. Their Irish coffee is perfect for the cold weather, they had a few different options.

    "text": "A little over 5 years ago Mr. M came to me and said, \"Do you hate winter?  I hate winter\".  I said, \"I've always hated winter\".  And then we started plans to move to Arizona.  I had been here many times over the years, but he had never been to the desert.  So you know me with my wily ways, I planned a fantastic scouting trip in the middle of March and we left St. Louis crappy winter/early spring weather to spend 4 days here in the Phoenix metro area.  One of the things we did was visit Rula Bula around St. Paddy's day and had great food, even better drinks, and got to see the Keltic Cowboys play. That was one of the rare nights in the past 10 years where I stayed up until 2 a.m.!!  What a great time.  Ever since then we've been back maybe 2 dozen times over the years and always have a great time.  For us we really enjoy getting some exercise around Tempe Town Lake and then rolling in here around 2 in the afternoon.  It's usually quiet and we can gab with the bartender and have a relaxing time.    On our most recent visit, about 2 weeks before Christmas, we stopped in on a Sunday completely unaware that they have a weekend brunch menu.  I had the traditional benedict plus avocado and really enjoyed that one.  I loved the fact that they put it on puff pastry instead of a heavier bread item.  I usually have to take half home, but this time I ate it all by myself and only let Mr. M have one teeny bite.    The Black Velvet cocktail on the menu sounded interesting and it was.  Champagne with some Guinness floating on top.  Pretty to look at and even better to drink.  We now have some Guinness and cheap champagne in the fridge to make one of those whenever we want.  Mr. M had his usual Guinness BBQ wings and some Jameson on the rocks.  No complaints there.  Jody took great care of us at the bar.  All in with the food and drinks it was $32.90 before tax and tip.  We always look forward to a visit to Rula Bula.",

Atmosphere was good, except I was there on a Friday, and halfway through my meal a rock/party band started playing. Decent band, but killed the atmosphere to be having fish and chips and Guinness while a band is whaling away on an Eagles tune. Instantly transformed from an Irish pub to every other party bar on the street. Even before the band they had alternative music playing on the sound system. 5 stars for food, but minus 2 for atmosphere and lack of a theme commitment.",

They even had vegan options, which came as a surprise!   I ended up with the special of the day which was a salmon salad. It was pretty good but there was an overwhelming amount of onions! Salmon was really tasty though!   The pub itself was really cool. I loved the architecture and the atmosphere and would love to go back in the evening for a few drinks! It's seems like a great place for groups and happy hour!",

I ordered an artichoke and spinach dip and guinness wings. They were very good. I also ordered the dirty Scotsman which is half Guinness and half kilt lifter. My friend ordered some chips, which are like really good flat potato wedges, but we never got them. The waitress forgot. And she didn't even come back so we can even tell her that she forgot them. The next time she came, it was to give us a box for the food. I.e, we were done eating.   Usually at trivia night I would have 3-4 beers but only had one because the waitress rarely checked on us, so how can I order more? Our waters weren't refilled either.  To sum up, 5 stars for the food, 1 star for the service and experience. :/",

    "text": "Hey Yelpers,  Was outvoted on coming here with my work friends for lunch. I admit not a huge fan of simple Irish food but made the best of it. Got the lunch special chicken salad wrap with potato salad.   They say everything is made from scratch and so far I can say I disagree. The wrap was good. At least the amount I got. What I mean by that is I pretty much got a whole sliced tomato in my wrap and a side of the chicken walnut mix. Pic attached. I was pretty bummed out on that. I think it's reasonable to expect a normal amount of tomato on a wrap. Seriously, these were like 1 inch thick slices in there. So when I first picked up the wrap I was really excited thinking I scored major Protein but to only be denied the wonderful goodness of chicken for a half rip tomato. Darn.   The potato salad was 4 stars and the service was decent. All in all, I left hungry and went back to the office to drown my so sorrows in animal crackers.",

I told her I had just moved here and she was more than happy to share her tips on other good places to drink!

    "text": "Let me start by clarifying that my five stars are for lunch on Mill. Rula Bula is a bit of a sleeper lunch place: if you've gone at night when school's in, it is very clearly a \"get crunked\" frat boy crazy kind of bar. So it will come as a damn good shock to you when you go during the light of day and enjoy a nice, relaxing lunch.  The fish and chips here are delicious. Beer-battered, thick and hearty, and real fish, served with a great tartar sauce and their awesome \"chips\"--lightly fried, thick potato slices.  Their boxty is a whole different story, but it's packed with flavor and incredibly hearty. Their salads are huge and everything is made up fresh, and you can tell they take pride in cranking out a really great lunch and catching you off guard. They're like a better Robbie Fox's, but they were here long before, and it's not hard to see why they've done so well.  Their patio is fantastic, the help is on top of things, the food comes quick, and everything is absolutely delicious and beautifully homemade, not just frozen, Sysco, dropped in the fryer, like so many pubs and bars. It matters and the price is right and it's WELL worth it to try this place for a great lunch.  My only complaint is that a few of the authentic Irish tables inside are too low for my legs to fit underneath, so I do well to avoid them for lunch. Otherwise, I'm always happy here for lunch.",

I supposed I should have ordered the dish and chips everyone raves about, but I just wasn't in the mood. Otherwise, the decor is great and actually quite authentic. Flogging Molly over the speakers?

I watched her try for over 30 minutes to find someone to watch the bar for her to go to the bathroom. She finally did just to immediately be turned around by the GM who said, \"can't you see I'm busy\".  About 5 minutes later he came and watched the bar. She was gone 3 mins and when she returned you could tell by the body language he was being very rude to her. Once he walked away you could see he felt empowered and above her. This guy needs talked to. He needs to realize we become repeat customers due to the servers and bartenders not because of the GM who never once engaged with a customer.

I've experienced better.\" really is spot on.   The food isn't horrible and I really like the patio here, but there are just so many better places to go. I guess the only thing that keeps me coming back whenever I happen to be on Mill is the fact that they have a Cider on tap. But unfortunately, that isn't enough to outweigh the negatives.   First of all, I am confused by the fact that people can smoke on this patio. I'm not sure how the laws work, but my favorite patios around the city are completely non-smoking and I definitely don't enjoy smoke with my meal. The tables and chairs are not in good shape and the tables are often left a little dirty. The servers aren't very friendly and seem to be rather miserable. On our most recent visit my husband held the door open for one of the staff members who then directed us to \"seat ourselves wherever\" without a thank you or welcome. Kind of weird. The food that we've tried is so-so. I'm not a huge fan of the Irish delicacies, but their veggie sandwich is decent.   I do really like the patio because it's off the main street and hidden in the back. It's a good spot to hang out after an afternoon event at Tempe Town Lake. Rula Bula is by no means a bad place to spend a little time, but with so many better options around the city I don't know if I'll return.",

The fish and chips are probably the best I've had, and I've lived in Florida for 4 years where fish is their thang.

My first impression was Wow, they fit a pretty big restaurant inside this little place on Mill Ave. My second impression was What the hec is that smell? The entrance smells interesting. not a bad interesting, just different. Where I sat in the back stank of nursing home. It was an older building, that I appreciated, but it stank to high heaven.   I didn't order anything to drink but my food was really good. Had the St. Panciro Chicken sandwich. It came on a great big chibata bread bun and the chicken was grilled nicely with jiucy tomatoes and not-to-leafy lettuce. Mixed in was a spicey sour cream and the softest avocados I have ever had. I love avocados on a sandwich and they were wonderful with the chicken. The sweet potato fries were delicious as well, they came with a hot, spicey dipping sauce that was indeed hot and spicey! Make sure you have a glass of water.   It was a good experience for what we were looking for for the evening but I cannot say I would go back. Maybe if I was feeling hipster but the smell really turned me off.",

Overall, I love the atmosphere and food of this place, so the little misunderstanding about what's open and closed won't keep me from going back.",

Inside was very charming - exposed brick and lots of wood - very pretty and \"inviting\". My date and I had the Irish Nachos - Yumm-meee!! Love the spuds they used too - reminded me of homemade spuds my gramma used to fry up for breakfast.  I had a Blue Moon and it was pretty delicious. They had a band which actually rocked - they played songs from Tracy Chapman, Tomy Petty, etc.  Good place to go - it does get crowded, so I recommend getting there sorta early to get a good spot.",

There is a wide selection of food and beverages on happy hour. Really, you can't miss on this one. BEWARE: Even though happy hour is 7 days a week, it is not available during special events, game days or for whatever random reason they feel. This part always makes me, a loyal regular, kind of pissy, but oh well. It has yet to deter me from going.  Every now and then, they have specialty dinners (single malt dinners, whisky dinners, etc.) that are quite awesome! Definitely be on the look out for posters in the bar and go to one. It's definitely worth the money and you'll be happy.  PS...they might have my single favorite bar food item...Hot Bollix. They are glorious, fried balls of deliciousness. Get some...NOW!",

The only reason Rula doesn't get a 5 is the amount of time we waited for drinks / food.  Granted, we were there on a Sunday during the Tempe Arts Festival - but that' no excuse for drinks taking 30 minutes and food taking more than 75.  We got the Irish Dip with fries & the American Sliders - both were tasty and worth ordering again.  I took a peek at the back patio, which I think would be amazing with a group of friends.  This area of Tempe has LOTS of choices, so I might not be back right away, but if I'm in the area & am craving Irish cuisine / beverages / music, I'll come back fo sho.",

I've always eaten up at the bar and the same bartender has been there to serve me over several years and he always goes above and beyond service expectations (I really appreciate that he always wants to know if I like my food after the first bite and always asks if I want a go cup for my drink as I'm paying).  Definitely a great place for lunch and at night they often have live music which rotates between inside and the patio based on the weather.  This is certainly one of my favorite spots in Tempe.",

However, this place has consistently terrible service. I eat here often for the food and I can honestly say I have never once had a good service experience.   On my most recent visit we waited 5 minutes for the host to even appear at the front desk. After we were seated someone brought us waters and it was 15 minutes until we tracked down a waiter to help us.   I observed the manager walking aimlessly around the restaurant ignoring the fact he had 1 waiter working every table inside and that his host kept walking to the back patio to fraternize which at one point caused a couple to give up waiting at the front desk and leave.   This experience isn't representative of every time I've been here but it is never much better.   Bottom line: the food is consistently pretty good but the service/management needs to be overhauled. Also, lay off the blasting of Irish folk music, I understand it's an Irish restaurant but it can be quite overbearing.",

On Friday and Saturday nights Rula Bula charges a cheap cover, but you also get some live entertainment, and you drink at one of the few places in Arizona which actually pours a Guinness correctly. Rula Bula also has a big patio, so on a nice night, it's a perfect place to hang out.   Tonight my cousin happened to be in town when he chose to give up his seat on his overbooked connecting flight. Since his hotel was right down the street from Mill, it was a convenient spot to get a beer and something to eat. We both drank a black and tan, which was excellently mixed. The food was actually pretty good. I just went with a corn beef melt, which was an alright sandwich. It was on ciabatta bread, which was doesn't quite compliment corn beef the same way that rye bread does. Nothing spectacular, but not bad. My cousin had chicken sliders which he seemed to enjoy. There also was a big selection of more authentic looking Irish dishes, but neither of us were hungry enough for anything bigger than what we had.",

The drinks were good (Southern Peach gets a thumbs up from me) and like everyone said, the fish and chips are YUMMO!!! I had the sweet potatoes fries with my fish and everything was scrumptious. They even had spicy ketchup, which is a rare find. Either I was hungry or it was really good because I could have licked my plate if I was allowed.  We also ordered a side of the the mac and cheese, which was just ok, only because we didn't know that it had ham in it and it made the mac and cheese taste very salty so I only had a bite or two. ( We didn't see it on the menu but we saw that someone else had ordered it hence the reason we ordered it.) I think without the ham, it would  have been pretty ok.  So with that said, great food, fabulous company, a little eye candy here and there, what more could a girl ask for?",

I decided to have my birthday party and moving away party at Rula Bula. You guys were charging cover and would not let me in for free even though it was the day of my birthday. Seriously? You guys must be the only place on Mill with that policy! So I paid because this is where I told all of my friends I'd be and I went inside. Well apparently you don't do well in the customer service training area because the red headed girl taking the money outside was sweet enough to call me a b*tch while my boyfriend was still right there. While workers will gripe about customers, it would most certainly bode well for you to tell your employees to at least wait until the whole party said person arrived with has gone inside because saying that in front of people doesn't really help build good customer relations.  The only upside is that Emily was good server, she was attentive, though our car bombs were skimpy. Over all I am saddened that I will have to find a new place to hold my coming back party when I come to see all of my friends.",
