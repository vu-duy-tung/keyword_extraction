Of course we shared the amazing melt in your mouth warm cookie with ice cream, but our dinner made us so full we may have left a bit or two. Next time dessert only, worth the stop for the dessert alone! Great food, great service...",

If I closed my eyes, I could swear I was back home. The sausage had a familiar taste and the ooey gooey cheesy goodness was heavenly! Crust was nice and crisp on the bottom. You can also sign up for their club and it gives you a free cookie dessert(which we took to go as we were Full!). The wait staff was wonderful too! Highly recommend!",

    "text": "We don't even bother going to other places for pizza anymore these days, for two reasons: the pizza here is really good, and the pizza cookie (but we'll get to that).    The BBQ chicken pizza here is incredible and we never pass it up when we're here.  Sometimes we'll branch out and try something else in addition - the Lawrence's Original is good and a nice contrast to the BBQ, although the tomato sauce is pretty salty.  We've also tried the Rosemary chicken, the mushroom pizza, and the meat pizza (another standout) and those were good too.  My father-in-law swears by the wings.  The drinks here are good - I especially recommend sangria or a mimosa.  They're not stingy with the alcohol, either. ;)  But the REAL reason to come here is for the pizza cookie.  I wish there were words to describe how good it is.  Whenever I see a cookie sundae type thing on a menu I'm obligated to try it.  I have had pizza cookies near and far.  Never once have I had one that could remotely compare to the Oregano's version.  It's the best dessert I've ever had, hands down.  Sometimes I luck out and my husband is too full to help me finish much of it - rest assured, no matter what, none of it gets wasted.  Sometimes I find myself looking up pictures of their pizza cookies online like a teenager furtively checking out the centerfold in a girlie magazine.  They're that good.  So anyway, give this place a try if you haven't yet!  And save room for the cookie at the end!",

    "text": "Must. Be. Patient. We tried Oregano's tonight while on a business trip. Kitschy decor, mid-20th century music and concrete floors make this a vibrant and noisy place. If your kids aren't famished (or if you have some snacks to tide them over while you wait for food), it seems like a good family spot where you don't need to worry about noise, or a place to meet friends and have some out-loud laughs.  We were immediately greeted at the host-stand and seated inside upon arrival (7:20 p.m. on a Wednesday evening); outside seating had a wait.  Food was decent. My colleague had the wings and I ordered a meatball side along with the All Kale Caesar salad. Service was pleasant but slow from the start, and progressively slower through the meal. Drinks took about 10 minutes. Food took at least 45 minutes to get to the table (I stopped checking my watch after that), but was near-temperature by the time it arrived (meatballs warm but not hot; salad room temp and not hot, thankfully). Regarding the Kale Caesar, the dressing was de-lish, with just the right hint of anchovy, and All Hail! those \"croutons,\" which were some sort of amazing and wonderful broiled cheese cube with the crunchy light texture of fresh-made buttered bread croutons. Salad not too heavily dressed either, which I really appreciate. I did take over half of the salad and one of the two meatballs home. Big portions.  Didn't have the patience or energy to order and wait for a pizza-cookie dessert thing. Maybe if I'm in town again, I'll order that first and skip everything else.",

This evening we placed an order for pick up through door dash. We received a notification before we even left the house that our food was ready to be picked up, 10 minutes later we get to the restaurant and they say it will be another 20 minutes. We finally get our order, take it out to the car and the order is wrong. Walk back into the restaurant and explain that our order is wrong and our food was supposed to be ready 30 minutes ago. They said we could wait while they then made the correct food. Considering we had already waited an additional 20 minutes after getting to the restaurant we didn't want to wait any longer. I asked for a refund, proceeded to wait a few minutes (in silence) and then they said our money would be refunded. During all of this we didn't receive any apology for any of the issues and in fact the staff at the desk seemed annoyed at us, as if we had put them out by wanting the food that we paid for. We were told we would be receiving a refund, though we were given no receipt or anything to prove that we will get our money back. We won't be back again. Incredibly disappointing.",

Friday night at 8:30 and of course they were super busy. I was greeted with a welcoming smile and they started to direct me to the 'to go' gal. I said I'd really like a glass of wine while I ordered. Even though the gentleman (I think he was a manager of some sort, super cute hispanic guy. So annoyed I didn't get his name) was obviously swamped he literally walked me to the bar to make sure I had a seat and let the bar tender know what I had asked for.   I looked like complete and total hell after spending the last 50 hours at the hospital across the street which of course they didn't know and made the way they took care of me that much more appreciated.  Ben at the bar was fantastic. Promptly brought me a glass of wine, took my order and although the order came out super fast not at all what you'd expect for such a busy Friday night I wasn't quite finished with my wine and he offered to put my salad in the walk in and my bread in the warmer. Very sweet! I said no don't worry I'll have the glass gone before you can even walk back and retrieve it.  They were all wonderful and it was very much appreciated. You never know what's going on in someone's life and even though they didn't think they did anything out of the ordinary, they did.",

I work in customer service myself and to give like this to my customers. But to be ther peraon who experiences it means a lot. I will be trying the menu out again. Thank you very much Oregano's for taking care of you're customers! I'll re-review once I get to try out the menu again.",

House Merlot was great. Was served with a complimentary garlic bread and cheese. Bread was toasted, crusty outside, soft inside with hot meaty cheese on top with a hint of garlic butter. After my friend ordered a salad. That bowl of salad can feed 3 people at the reasonable price. At last I have ordered a pasta dish lady is a scampi. I can only say.... OH MY GOD. Pasta was good perfectly, moist but not too saucy. Shrimp was HUGE and crunch. The size of the shrimp is bigger then my thumb. Will be back when I have a chance to go back to AZ.",

We ordered the garlic bread for appetizer with marinara sauce and the marinara was a little chunky for my liking however it was still delicious.... my friend got the bollo pasta (endless refills) with meatballs and this was delicious and served with fresh Parmesan cheese... the meatballs were huge, juicy and delicious... I ordered the deep dish pizza TAKES 45 MINUTES to cook just FYI and it was full of cheese meat and sauce and the crust was perfectly cooked--- ORDER THE DEEPDISH=magnificently scrumptious.. we ended the dinner with the original pizza cookie and even though I was about to pop, I made room and it too was delicious....

    "text": "We've been frequent lunch patrons to the Oregano's at Dobson & Southern and pretty well know what to expect.  The visit today was well below par.    My friend and I both ordered the all you can eat pasta bowl with meat sauce.  Of course the plate come with a pile of spaghetti and a minimal 4 oz of meat sauce.  Enough to make you want some.  We both immediately order more meat sauce fully aware we're getting tagged for another $2 for the privilidge.  Lunch is almost half over when the waitress asks how everything is and we again ask for the freaking meat sauce.    When finally she brings the sauce one was marina.  My friend took the meat sauce, and rather than eat plane noodles I dumped the marinara on my plate.    When later I let the waitress 'Samantha' know about the mistake, rather than apologize she gave me a syrupy \"are you sure?\"  I told her I wasn't interested in an argument.    When the bill came of course I had been charged for the meat sauce.  I paid the bill, left no tip and will not return to this Oregano's again.    I have had positive experiences on every prior visit and and at other Oregano's especially on Elliot Rd, on University, and in downtown Gilbert.    I don't know if 'Samantha' was expressing herself with her poor service or management; from my perspective it doesn't matter.  Our dining experience was spoiled over 4 ounces of meat sauce we had to order twice, never received, yet paid for rather than debate the matter further.",

Fair prices, great service, delicious food, good cocktails .. you really can't get much better than that.

I had their BiGRiG pasta bowl with wheat rigatoni, the consistency of the pasta and flavor of the sauce were pretty good but I still had to flavor it up with spice and herbs, not what I was expecting for something that says it was supposedly to be spicy.  I ordered a side sausage and must say it was the highlight of the entree, perfectly crisp outside and superb flavor.  A good place if in the area for Italian food but I wouldn't say somewhere that one would go out of their way for, chain restaraunts usually aren't.",

    "text": "Sweet baby Jesus! I am carrying the most massive food baby right now.   My husband was craving pasta so I researched some new places we could go to get some. Oregano's seemed to be a big hit so we settled on this place for dinner tonight. Let me tell you... no matter how hard you try, you will not leave here hungry.   There was no wait for a table and we got to sit out on the patio. It was so nice outside tonight and the misters were going. It was very enjoyable. Our server was very friendly and fast. I like that the drink glasses are gigantic. Usually my husband and I drink water faster than it can be poured but these were so huge we only needed one refill the entire meal, and even before the glass was empty our server picked them up to get refilled. Points for that. I hate empty water glasses. We decided on the boom dip to start. It was good, nice chunks of spinach and artichokes, but it was extremely oily. It sits too heavy in my belly. This alone almost filled me up, so I can see someone making a meal out of just an appetizer.   I decided on the big rig pasta and my husband got the alfredo. The portions were so huge! But his was not that good. Sort of bland. I was expecting it to be a lot creamier and have a more spicy flavor. Mine was really good though. It wasn't too spicy, but I was expecting more of a kick, and it had a nice creamy sauce. Pretty much by the time our pasta was in front of us I was full from the dip so I ate a few bites and had it packed up to go. I definitely have lunches for the next two days. By this point we were both so full it hurt, so we ordered the pizza cookie to go so we could eat it at home. Which was the perfect amount of time to start digesting some food. In the 30 minutes it took to bake it, pay, drive back home, and get inside I was already ready to eat it. So we sat on the couch and devoured the entire thing in less than five minutes. Food baby number two of the night.  I really liked the food here. You get ginormous portions so you are more than likely always going to take food home. It wasn't too expensive. $35 for the two of us for one appetizer, two pastas, and desert. I think next time we will nix the appetizer and just go with dinner. But the pizza cookie is definitely worth getting at least once. I may not come back right away but I'll definitely be visiting again.",

Anywho, stopped in here and we checked out the menu ordered an order of the golden wings ( I believe they are called) hot/sweet flavor... these were very good. Also some on the meatiest wings I have ever had to be honest, hormone injected wings up in this joint is what you will get and they are very tasty. the boyfriend ordered the lasagna and the girl told us it would take 45 min alone for the lasagna..luckily we had a few errands to run so it was cool to come back and get our food but i  think that would have sucked if we had been eating there and having to wait ( especially if you were starving). Then again it's nice to know its cooked fresh. I had the Pesto pasta which came in a nice scooped out bread bowl with my choice of meat.. I got the Italian sausage.   Everything was o.k, I went with high expectations and was let down a little, will try one of their pizzas next maybe that's the winner dish to have here..  p.s staff is very helpful/friendly and it is a nice atmosphere inside and out on the patio as well.",

    "text": "Great News....  Oregano's  reached out to me and apologized for the terrible service and encouraged me to try the Mesa location once more.     I decided to try again  yesterday for dinner and what a difference.  People were friendly, engaging and overall our party was very happy with the service.  They seemed to really care that we chose to come into their restaurant.   I am changing my previous 2 stars to 5. It was really that much better!   Way to go! I am a fan again!   Below is my previous post   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is the 2nd time I have been to this location where the service was not good.    I know they can do better and the training is better than this, since I used to work for Oregano's.     The first time was a month or so ago, but I chalked that up to the place just having a bad night.  I know they happen.  I went back again a few days ago with some friends but  the service was just the same; slow,  kinda rude, and un-attentive.   The experience started when we showed up with a 25 min wait on a Friday night (which i know is common), no big deal. We got some drinks at the bar, and sat in the waiting area.  Then I decided I would grab an appetizer for our group. I walked up to the hostess/togo counter to order and pay for it and the to-go girl started to ring me up with no problems. Awesome...right??  NO, the manager  (I know she was the manager, because she was wearing black) stopped her mid transaction and asked me to step to the other side of the counter to order with an actual server.  My thoughts.... OK fine, whatever. The problem was the tone and that she said \"no she can't help you, she has to help you over there\" and pointed to an actual server on the other side of the counter.  So I walked and had to wait until she was done putting in another order, after a  few min she was able to help me.  I get it, they are busy, but what was wrong with the to-go counter taking an order?  Especially since there was no wait and she was not on the phone.  That was off-putting.  I say this because I know better, I know Oregano's trains better than this.   Moving on to dinner.  Since we already had drinks from the bar, I guess your server decided we didn't need any  refills the rest of the night, even after waiting 45 min to get our food.   We didn't order anything that takes a while (2 pasta dishes and a sausage sandwich), the kitchen was not slammed, since it was 9pm with several empty tables. Basically I had no drink for my dinner. We saw our server a total of 3 times.  Once to take our order, 50 min later to see how the food was, and last to drop the check.   As we were leaving the manager was giving a half-assed apology to another table for the abnormal amount of time things took, and honestly we were there MUCH longer than them.   The disappointing part is that I love Oregano's and I talk it up all the time. But this was a real let down.",

We don't go there every week; but we go there enough to know that you wait for a table unless it is before 5 p.m. or a weekday. I usually gravitate to heartier fare, and since I LOVE pesto I could only recommend the Pesto Penne Bake; I usually get it with sausage. My better half always gets the \"Alfredo The Dark\" which is a spicy southern style alfredo; if you like heat and alfredo, this is a perfect marriage of the two!! We don't get drinks but half of the time we do get a Pizookie and the bill never makes it above $40.00. That being said, I almost forgot; if you like cookies than you better try the Pizookie!! This is the best fresh outta' the oven cookie with ice cream that not even your own Mom could ever replicate!!! I have seen Pizookie addicts, hell I married one!!! Let me tell you, once you have tried the pizookie you will understand the Cookie Monster's struggle!!",

The waiters were all very much on top of it and worked together so when my fork fell, someone else grabbed one for me immediately. That being said, the food left something to be desired. The bruschetta was difficult to eat and has way too much raw garlic. The garlic bread with cheese was basically bread with a ton of cheese on top and nonexistent garlic. We got a dinner salad too which was what one would expect- lots of lettuce, a sliced tomato, boring. The pizza was ok but not great and the crust was really, really greasy. The pizzookie or whatever they call it was, however, really, really good. And just know, it takes a while (40 minutes at around 3pm for us) for the pizza to come.",

So we waited with all the other suckers in the entranceway. When we were taking to the back finally The place we were seated was in the back patio where the misters were running full blast. So I shared a pizza with some other folks. Real basic pizza - pepperoni. When it came I noticed it was very salty. Luckily I was sharing so I didn't have to eat all of it myself. Really, the quality was on par with Chuck E. Cheese or some other place like that where the food is not the main reason for your attendance. The soft drink I was drinking from had a slightly flat taste. Service was very good, though. Probably the only thing I can complement the place on. Really makes me wonder why there are long lines to get in. Meh. I won't ever do this again. I'll be the sole dissenting voice if our group ever brings up this idea again. Lots of parking - in the same mall as Saketini, Hodori, Asiana Market, Best Hong Kong Dining, and Szechuan Express.",

We ordered ONE round of beers and before our pizza even came out we were told that we were going to be refused to order any more drinks. The waiter came up and told us this without us even attempting to order anything more. We were not rowdy, we were not warned about anything, and we were not given any specifics as to why we were being \"cut off\" before we even attempted to order any more drinks.   When we brought this to the manager's attention and asked for specifics and a real explanation, she was rude, not helpful, and really didn't seem to care about our experience. I think her name was Cher.   Cher eventually offered to give us a discount of 20%, but then conveniently added a 20% gratuity to our bill. We were a group of 5. Funny how that actually took money out of the company's pocket and put it right into the pockets of the unprofessional employees. She refused to take this tip off our tab and we happily left the establishment.  I would not recommend this place to anyone for any reason. I would rather eat bad pizza with nice people than good pizza with rude people.",

Served in a Bread Bowl jam packed with broken up Meat Balls mixed in with the Ziti and covered with Cheese. What more can I say the HEAVEN! I was only able to eat about a third of it.

The pasta dish was also amazing. The pasta alone would've been fine but the addition of the meatballs and sausage made it a great meal.

They were so loud causing all of the tables to turn and look at them and swearing in a very crude manner. In general ruining everyone else's experience.  It was so bad that the table next to us had to explain to his daughter that it is not appropriate to behave that way in public ever. Not once during this whole ordeal did management step in and ask this table to please \"tone\" it down or leave. Once the table left we asked to speak to the manager and were asked which one. There were three on duty! Our server grabbed the manager who happened to be clearing the table where those unruly patrons sat. He claimed to \"not know\" all of the bad behavior that was going on but when he approached the table to clear it with another employee they were discussing it. He even poked fun at it saying \"Mayday! Mayday!\" By no means am I a formal person but there is a level of appropriate table manners that people should adhere to when dining in public. And I have never dealt with management of any establishment that would allow that kind of behavior to transpire. Even in a sports bar they would have been asked to leave. Unfortunately my husband and I will not return to this location and not suggest it when asked for a recommendation.",

The pizza was over salty and the server called for her manager to see if he can do something about it and instead of giving us some kind of discount or offer to provide us a different order he said he was going to take off 2 toppings from our bill. This was unacceptable the bill was over priced at $34.74.",

    "text": "Came here after listening to my buddy's recommendation, and boy was I surprised! As we entered it truly feels like we warped into another dimension where crazy is the norm. They have paddle boards, cans, old portrait, books, and many other miscellaneous items placed everywhere...  but hey... it works! The front clerk had a very cheerful additude which helped alleviate with the wait. 15 minutes later of classy soft jams we were seated and ready to order!  Jenny our waiter was extremely friendly she really helped me decide what to order, so I was expecting to have a fantastic time. Then 30 minutes elasped, in my mind I'm thinking good food takes time to make... until we started to see other tables that sat after us get their entrees and others that finished. Another 15 minutes passed now I'm starting to wonder if they forgot our order... Argggg, it turns out that's exactly the case!  I was appalled when Jenny our server attempted to play it off like it's was not her fault... Thankfully, the manager noticed that something had gone awry and gave us a free appetizer.  Still stumped that Jenny had the audacity to treat us like a bunch of mindless meatheads, and worst of all she didn't even apologize for the mistake.   Kickbutt Garlic Bread, (4.99 + .89) Came out nice and toasty. Not much to say, I'd be shocked if anyone messes up toasting garlic bread. That said, tasted like garlic bread with cheese.   Zany Ziti, hard breaded bowl outer shell with 4 cheese and pasta (8.99). Great presentation and portion size, but the pasta did not tasted fresh, and the breaded bowl was so hard it's virtually inedible. What a shame! If only they used fresh pasta and not overbaked the breaded bowl this dish could easily be one of my favorites.  Stuffed Riga Tony with Meatballs (9.89). OK this time they done the meatballs justice, very juicy and just the right amount of salt. Perfecto! The tubular rigatoni also delivered, it had perfect harmony of cheese and tomato sauce, neither overpowering the other. Overall this dish is Magnifico!  Original Pizza Cookie, chocolate chip + ice cream on top. Cookie was super soft and chewy complimented with scoops of creamy ice cream that brought a smile to my face.   Service 1/5 Taste 3/5 Value 5/5 Overall 3/5  Man! What a rollercoaster ride, started off very rocky and persisted throughout the course of the meal. Our service was a disaster, hopefully it's just one bad seedling. Im sure on their A game this place is the place to be, but for now as is... it's a risk I'm not willing to take.  Pro tip: order less, their entrees are large enough to satisfy two people!",

    "text": "I like this place, live across the street and was excited to walk over to do homework while eating the all you can eat pasta, however I was informed wi-fi was not available, thus leaving me unable to do any work. Why? I understand part of the concept at Oregano's may be old-fashioned, and maybe that's the reason, but I don't think wireless internet would diminish that. If you don't want people on their phones, they will be anyways. Plus, you're across the street from a college campus. College students use wi-fi for school and might spend money here if they could do homework. Maybe it's a cost thing, but how many bowls of pasta do you have to sell each month to pay for it? I could always order take-out and go back home, but what's the fun of that? I think I'd rather go somewhere else with worse food and wi-fi in order to get work done than better food without it. Sorry",

Was seated and spent some time looking at the menu and figured out everything we wanted to order. After about 10 minutes no one had acknowledged us and we decided to give them 5 more minutes. After 15 minutes of being ignored we decided to leave. I think the worst part was seeing so many employees walking by and no one thought to ask if we had been helped!

When we finally received our it it was not prepared the way we ordered it, not to mention it was cold. The waitress rudely told me that was what I ordered. Then I reminded her of my order and even included her dialogue that my choice sounded good.  She came to my table and said the ingredients that I ordered were under the cheese. It was a dusting of cheese on a thin crust and there were no other ingredients under the dusting of cheese. I had to pick the tiny bit of cheese off the pizza to show her there was nothing under the dusting of cheese.   Several times during my visit I had to physically get up from the table to get the waitresses attention.   We had a very long wait to order, long wait to receive our food, and then a long wait to receive out check. Instead of waiting to pay the bill we went to the front where pick up orders are paid for. The manager took our check, he walked away saying he would handle our check and he disappeared. We waited at the front of the restaurant, and it was the waitress that returned with our check and not the manager. During the checkout process she continued to be rude.  The manager did comp our pizza, thank you, but overall it was a terrible dining experience.",

When taking out, the food is always ready!  My four favorites are the \"Italian Gold wings,\" \"Numero One-O,\" \"Bistro Sweet Po's,\" and French Fries.   The Italian Gold wings are chicken wings cooked with a honey mustard BBQ sauce. The Numero One-O is a stuffed pizza with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, and green onions.   The Bistro Sweet Po's are sweet potato fries. And as for the French Fries, they are crispy and ruffled!   Oh yes, and DO try the dessert. I recommend the Chocolate Chip dessert, which is essentially a hot pizza cookie -- made entirely of chocolate chip.   Prices from about $5 to $9 for appetizers. Pizza prices range from about $14 to $23.   There are also lasagnas, pastas, and sandwiches -- all of which are good.",

The food portions are unusually big (my friend got a junior sized salad that was probably as big as our pasta portion!) The penne pasta bake looked good. Bollo pasta was all you can eat, but my friend couldn't eat even one bowl. Three of us got the 6 inch ravioli and they weren't kidding about the size. It was good, but sooo big that I just kind of got sick from all the pasta and cheese after eating about half. I ended up eating about 3/4 of it.

    "text": "Oreganoes? My second visit to the Mesa restaurant. Guess what? Chicken but I like it. It's not great; it's kinda fun but not like a merry-go-round kinda fun (that's like one of the bests next to roller coasters! Oh emm gee!). It also has a fairly horrific... I mean fairly terrific patio and a good patio goes a long *insert expletive* way. For whatever reason, maybe something to do with the damp dark basement I had to eat my dinners alone in as a wee lad after spilling a gallon of paint on the garage floor (I did it quite often. It made the garage prettier.), I would prefer to eat at a patio table over a table inside any day of the year, even an August in Phoenix metro area or a rainy day (if it's covered). This one in Mesa is covered even though the two times I've been there the weather was beautifully moderate. Another wonderful  thing about patios is... that in civilized places you can smoke however, this is Mesa. It does have a fire pit though for those cold nights when the company you're with isn't quite warm enough.  This second visit of mine I met a few friends from school who were devouring a 's-wonderful thin crusted pizza topped 's-marvelous bits of mushrooms and smothered in a 's-awful-ly nice blanket of cheese. Tasty (without and exclamation mark). The food that I've tried is fairly mediocre; not bad but not great. I mostly had a couple of Kilt Lifters while they ate their delectably edible giant frisbee.   The first time I went was with a few friends and this one dwarfish guy that reminds me of sharp pointy things and dull wit but mostly I was able to ignore Gimli because of the scrumptious Turkey Stuffed. Ordering from the menu was a bit of a sensory overload, though. That menu has stuff going on! Over here and over there and don't forget this just passed that. Egads!   The service was fair and friendly both times and the food was brought out in a timely fashion. And this most recent time we were cursin' up a storm too. It was like a brothel full of sailors on the patio that afternoon which I think the Mormon family next to us appreciated more than we did.   The food = meh The patio and service = pretty good.   Look! it's my first A-OK.",

Especially Austin and Paige at the Bar! Since it is close to where I live, I get to go fairly often.  The swervers know me and my partner pretty well. We usually get the same things too because they are terrific.  The ceasar  sald is a good portion to share while you wait for your pizza slice, spinach and onion for me and peperoni with extra sauce for my BF.  Sometimes I will get the Turkey stuffed-which is how you'll feel if you eat the whole thing along with it's yummy cottage fries.  I like dipping them in the incredibly hot wing sauce.  They warn me about it everytime and my guts hate it but my mouth loves it!!! They are also famous for their \"pizzookie\", although it is called something else.  It is a rich decadant cookie with ice cream and chocolate sauce.  I am always too full to try it, but I see alot of them going out to other tables.  So it must be pretty darn good. There are several locations through out the valley so chances are ther is one nearby.",

They were hot and ready on time. The place was packed at 7:30 on Saturday night. Fast service at the cashier. I am a pizza lover from Chicago - and I generally go with the deep stuff but went thin for the rest of the family. Crust was light and crunch and the taste was a great balance between the sauce and the cheeses. Toppings were fresh and tasty. Don't miss this great pizza!",

The CEO, Mark Russell, not only greeted us at the door but hand the staff provide quality service and food to our group prior to being open. We happened to pull into the parking lot for a matter of minutes when we were so warmly greeted by Mark. He never mentioned he was the CEO at any givenn time. This didn't stop him, he opened the door and waited on us as if he were part of the staff. I will be a lifetime customer of this Oregano's location along with my group of friends and clients. Did I fail to mention he did so all free of charge? Yes, the food and service was gievn to us for free, just by offering to come in and try out their new location. (They were not open yet) The food was incredible, best pizza I have eaten. My fiance is a pizza connoisseur and he has none better than Oregano's. Thumbs up all around!!! Thanks again for the excellent hospitality and gourmet pizza! Highly Recommend.",

I'd recommend getting the junior sized salads, the larger sized one is insane! The pizza is also delicious. All the favors mix perfectly no matter what topping, and the cheese is excellent! Always make sure they put on some freshly shredded Parmesan on your pizza.   The music choice is a little weird. Christmas music was playing, in September! Also, the decorations are a little bland as well. Christmas lights are wrapped around surf boards, and half of the lights don't even work!! The small 12 inch TVs are put in high awkward spots, but it doesn't matter because they're usually playing old black and white TV shows.   Overall though I'd recommend Oreganos. Delicious good and great service, and I will be coming back",

He was easily one of the best servers I've encountered in a long while. Kudos to Timothy. C ordered Kids Pasta w/ Rigatoni. ($4.78) He loved it. He said the pasta was fine and the sauce was great. I ordered the side of Brussels Sprouts ($4.89) and the side of Chicken ($4.99). The Brussels Sprouts were cooked almost perfectly. I didn't find one sprout that was under cooked. Yummy. The chicken was seasoned nicely and tasted great.  Awesome Service. Clean Facility. Reasonable prices. 5 Stars.",

I had my son run in there to get us a table. No waiting line. Ya ya.   We started out with their Big Julius Caesar Salad. This is their small salad. This was huge. We had four people and could barely finish this. So good and fresh. My wife could have just eaten the salad. We also ordered the large order of wings with BBQ sauce. Huge wings with lots of meat. Really love the wings with the ranch dipping sauce. Yum yum good. Of course we always order their Chicago thin crust pizza with sausage, meatballs, and mushrooms. Fresh ingredients, perfectly cooked. Loved the meatballs and sausage so good. I'm a fan of Oregano's pizza and wings.   Of course we're stuffed but you can never and I mean NEVER leave Oregano's without their pizza cookie. A must. We had the half chocolate chip and peanut butter cookie topped with vanilla ice cream with chocolate chips sprinkles. To die for. So good. This always tops off a good meal.   They are always known for their huge portions and tonight was not a disappointment. Service was great. Drinks were at our table in no time and surprisingly our food came out pretty quickly. Our server and the manager kept on coming by our table to make sure everything we good. Loved the service.   Like I said before. Love Oregano's. Good food. Good atmosphere. Loud and fun place to eat. Just make sure you get there by 5:30 at the latest or else you could be waiting in line for a really really long time. We'll be back for sure. Enjoy.",

The restaurant was on a wait so we decided to sit at the bar which we do not normally do.  Kimerz (how it was written on the receipt, she told us her name was Kim) was awesome! She was so on top of everything, we were astonished.  From making drinks for servers to answering server questions, to taking food to tables and taking care of the other couple of people at the bar.  We didn't understand how she did it all and was fast at it.  We overheard servers complimenting how fast she was.  She also took the time to talk to us and recommend some other Oregano's favorites to try in the future like the big rig pasta or cheesy garlic bread but with pepperoni under the cheese (yum!)  The food was great also.  We had ordered the Schooner which came out a little undercooked but we told Kim about it and she immediately had the problem fixed.  A manager also came over to make sure we were satisfied with the new order.  Great customer service.  We felt welcomed and were greeted by many employees including kitchen staff.   Even though they do not have the faster oven (I think they call it a bell oven), our order came out quickly and was delicious.  We will definitely be back to this location soon.  This may be our new \"go to\" Oregano's location!",

I do not know if we were just lucky on our trips to Scottsdale, but we never had to wait too long to be seated and the food was just spot on every time.  We arrived at around 7:30ish.  We opted to be seated outside because it was recommended and the host said it was not going to be hot because of the misters.  Uh, wrong!  We have been seated outside before, at other restaurants, and the misters make a difference.  Not at Oregano's (because many seats are not near the misters).  After about 10 minutes when no one came to see if we were thirsty, and we were, we went back in to wait for an indoor seat.    We waited, waited, waited.  People who came in after us were seated. Two ladies came in and the hostess brought them drinks.  We'd been at the restaurant for about 40 minutes by this point, and no one offered us anything to drink. It was frustrating, and if I had not been texting I would not have realized how long we were waiting, but because of the time stamps, I knew how long we were sitting and sitting.    We finally got seated, and our amazing server, Kelan, had our drinks within a couple minutes.  He topped us off so that we were never thirsty and had plenty to drink while eating.  The service was really exceptional, and it was a relief because by the time we were seated we were frustrated.  The food was fine.  Hardly any jalepenos on the carne asada pizza, but it still tasted good although it lacked any heat.    Don't think we'd go back to this location, but if I do I hope Kelan is working because he was the only positive about the evening.  Good food, but we could easily get equal quality elsewhere and it is not worth the grief.",

I tried a tortellini,  nothing special.  I thought they were bland and watery with not enough filling. Neat selections and combinations of flavor.

We let our server know we didn't have a kid menu. The appetizer came out 10 minutes later, 5 minutes after that they finally brought a kid menu. We told the server the baby would just eat off our plates whenever that came. The food came out in big portions and was delicious as always. We ordered a pazooki and it came out in 4 minutes. We were so happy until we saw that the cookie wasn't cooked. The server never checked on us so we just ate the ice cream. She was busy and moving around so I don't blame her but the system is obviously broken here as this is the typical service.   If you don't want to wait you can order To-Go... but that is half the size as if you order in store.",

    "text": "Upon browsing Yelp for a restaurant close by I stumbled on Oreganos. I read the most recent review and just had to try it out. Hoping to have the same amazing experience as that reviewer and his son (the birthday boy) even down to asking for the same server.  Hands down the best experience my family and I have had in a long while. It's a busy place but we only waited 5-7mins for a table. Once you experience how great their food is, you'll  know why it's well worth the wait however long it is.  On suggestion we started with the garlic cheesy bread,  the Pablo Mexican salad,  18\" thin crust One-O supreme pizza and ending the food coma with a chocolate chip pizza cookie. The food was melt in your mouth good and cooked to perfection.   Although the bar drinks took way too long (especially when we could see he wasn't busy) our server Cassie was so friendly and pleasant she actually made me forget how long it had even been! Cassie is the reason we wish we could give it 100 stars. She made great food suggestions, connected with not only my wife and I but my kids too. She was extra thoughtful with drinks to go and packing up our food for us  without even asking her, we are TEAM CASSIE all the way! Employees sure can make a place, especially when you have kids. I can tell Cassie loves her job and it's contagious! The entire atmosphere from their  \"Welcome in\" to everyone that walked in the doors down to the manager Pat helping Cassie deliver our food and following through on checking how our meal was before we left. Top notch food & customer service!! Thank you,  You can bet we will be back!",

The \"Our Chicago Italian Sausage\" sandwich was served charred black and mostly unedible.  The two sides I ordered, meatballs and the new Tree Hugger Skillet dish, were not delivered together -and the server did ask if I wanted them together.  All items except the veggie skillet were served at the same time.  Bartender said something indistinguishable and promptly disappeared.  Skillet dish arrived maybe ten minutes later.  Our server, the bartender guy, didn't once ask if we would like Parmesan on any of our dishes nor did he ask how everything was or check up on us during our meal EXCEPT to ask if we would like another drink.  He didn't speak directly to me but took it upon himself to make a drink for each of us. FWIW, the person that ordered the Sausage sandwich says he likes his food cooked well done and told me that was a good (looking) char. Two bites was all he had. Son decided he would take his leftovers for lunch but couldn't eat it because of the excessive char. Sounds like it was forgotten on the grill.  Possibly same fate of my veg order which couldn't be concealed in a loaf of bread. Boo Oregano's kitchen for sending out burnt food. Boo to last nights bartender for your mediocre customer skills.",

Food and drinks arrived quickly and were good. Prices are a bit high for pizza and pasta, but the atmosphere made it enjoyable. They have a good selection of menu items which gives you lots of options. For dessert they have a pizza cookie topped with ice cream which is one of my favorites and reason enough to come here.",

Things of note:  1) Memorabilia from the 50s, 60s or whenever it was people thought they were cool, plastered all all over the place. 2) The misters outside. No, not men. Those things that spray mist. See, I thought the word mister was funny to describe those machines. 3) The patio, it's nice out there when the heat isn't too dry. The misters do their job; the patio is awesome, especially at night.  Things that were awesome:  1) The service. Our waiter Kris was friendly, attentive, but not hovering. All smiles and did not begrudge us anything. 2) The Pizza Cookie! This was one of the best desserts I've had in long time. 3 scoops of ice cream on a freshly baked cookie the size of a small plate. Big O on a plate! I wish they had the Choco Macadamia, but all they had was Choco Chip. It wasn't what we wanted, but we devoured it like hyenas to fresh kill. MMMMM.  I had the Pesto Pasta Bowl, complete with the edible bread bowl. That was mighty wonderful, and plentiful. My friends devoured an all-meat pizza and my friend, he sucked down a plate of wings like a Hoover to a carpet, with a mess of red sauce on his fingers and his mouth. Lovely pic. Pollack couldn't have done a better job.  This was a wonderful venture. I begged them that we go back, but alas, we never had the time. I need to go back. We don't have this in SoCal. I wanna go back! I wanna go back! I wanna try more stuff!",

I think I've tried the margarita pizza and really liked it but I was dieting the last time I went and ordered the pesto pizza-it seemed a little too pesto-y and no other flavor kinda, but my husband liked it so...huge drinks and really great sweet potato fries with amazing dipping sauce. I just love the atmosphere at these places. The one in Tempe off of university I believe is my fav though. Their patio is very fun and awesome!",

Upon entering, I liked how the location was set up.  We were told there would be a wait for a table inside, or we could sit immediately outside or at the bar.  We really wanted a table, so we waited in the lobby area.  About 10 minutes later, we were escorted to a nice booth.  We reviewed the menu, which had a huge selection of not only pizza, but pastas and subs as well.  Quite an impressive selection.  We couldn't decide on a pizza to split, so we each got our own dish.  My friend got the Ravioli, and I got a steak n cheese sub.  The portions were huge!  Plus, there was not a tremendous wait for it either.  Anyways, I really liked this place, and would return to eat thier food again.",

Then the waiter (who was super fun and nice, just like their entire staff) said it would be twenty for our pizza to be ready...it was forty. The food is always amazing, but I noticed a waitress bringing the manager a spoon with a little bug in it!!! Apparently someone found it in their food! The atmosphere is fun, but horrid for large groups. It's insanely loud and our table was super crowded. It was a table fit for four, seating seven. Despite all the negatives, the food is always delicious, that is the pizza is good. The shrimp scampi was dry and tasteless. Waste of money.",

I would love to go back and get what i orginally order (deep dish pizza) and i would love to get it for free, if and only if that happens will i be returning to oreganos",

While I'm not a big fan of calamari, I absolutely LOVE wings. Oregano's wings were pretty damn amazing. It has to be up there with the top 1% of wings I've tried. The timing of the appetizers was pretty nice as well. Calamari came out first, then the wings shortly after, and finally...  THE AMAZING PIZZA. wow. the chicago pan crust pizza was simply perfection. everything was perfect about it. the only downside was that it came straight out of the oven to our table, and so if you tried to get a slice everything would fall off. My advice would be to wait for the pizza to cool off before you even attempted to take a slice. Other than that, try not to cream in your mouth from the orgasm you'll have from eating this slice of amazingness. Seriously, it is perfect in so many ways. The crust has an amazing texture, the cheese is perfectly melted, the toppings aren't crap, and the sauce is the pinnacle of evolution and mother nature.  To top off all of this, it was cheap. I think we paid $20 for calamari, 9 wings, and a 10\" pan pizza with 2 sodas. Now I'm confused if that is actually how much we paid...  I suppose the one thing we didn't try was the pizza cookie...oh well, now I have an excuse to go back.",

The 2nd order was the big besto saled. I had some questions i thought there was suposto be fresh onions and tomatoes. I called in. The women that pucked up the phone was extremely rude from the beginning. She would cut me off mid-sentence then asked me repeat my self then mid sentence she would cut me off agen.   When she finally allowed me to get a word in. She told me that you guys did not have a big Bistro saled on the menue. Well thats kinda funny because I literally just ordered it and on doordash. Anytime I have ever ordered anyting to go from this establishment something's always wrong with my togo order. I will never come back here again  Also the meat on your salad was extremely dry and tasteless. The only enjoyable thing was your guys's jumbo sausages. I would say thr pasta as well but with no garlic bread was the meal just felt incomplete.",

I door dash it and tonight was so disappointing.... they gave me not even half filled bowl of spaghetti with barely any sauce  this is not $11.78 worth. Every time I order this, it always comes full but this time I can not believe I got this delivered. Can't even go back because the door dash deliverer left. The salad however was filled up to the top :/ what's going on oreganos?? I ordered more than an hour before you guys close so I'm not sure why I got such poor quality food",

The server was great and did a awesome job.  We order the side of Italian sausages and they were fing awesome.  Cooked to perfection and the cheese was superb.  We ordered a deep dish with all sausage and with pepperoni on my half.  That was probably the best deep dish pizza I have had at this location for all the times I have come here.  The pizza was so balance in the amount of cheese and extras.  The bottom had a bit more dough too.  This place has been great.  We got the cookie dough desert too and it was fantastic.  Great place to eat.",

I ordered the chicken parm & was surprised at how small the chicken portion was compared to the pasta in the dish. The sauce was average (mine is better & I'm Dutch).  Service was good, but not as fast / consistent as it has been at other locations. I think this location relies heavily on the Oreganos brand for business as it isn't like other locations with regard to service or food.  We will definitely give Oreganos another shot; everyone has an off day",

Some positives, chicken wings were very good although a bit spicier than other places. The pizzas were huge. We will get 4 to 8 meals out of them. The problems (this was take out), my wife's pizza was supposed to have double pepperoni. We couldn't find any. My pizza had a lot of sausage but it didn't taste like the excellent sausage they used to use. And it was very undercooked, the crust was not set on the inside. We ordered the Caeser salad. Lettuce tasted stale like it came out of a bag. Dressing bland. Not enough dressing. Croutons were very good, sadly the best part. We will not be going back.",

I have gatherings her with large groups often because they have space and such a large variety for all. You cannot go wrong with the food here and they serve drinks as well ! The dessert cookie with ice cream is something you rarely have room to order because your meal was so fabulously filling. So order it and take it home I say! If they had more stars I would give them hands down! I will always be back oh and fyi..this is the same at all the locations. I have tried Tempe, Mesa & Scottsdale.",

My friend and I sat at the bar, Megan was our bartender and was so friendly. We were talking to her about our crazy night/week and our irresponsible plans for the night and she gave us suggestions for old town tonight! She was awesome.  We get our Bloody Mary, the fixings kinda sucked, one pickle and an olive. Maybe we are just spoiled from Wisconsin because Wisconsin bloodys alwayssss at least have cheese and a beef stick, bacon sometimes, pickle, lemon, lime and olive served with a beer chaser. Megan was awesome again, and gave my friend an extra pickle and a \"sample\" of beer to serve almost as that chaser. Again- Megan is great.  The Bloody Mary however was god awful. We asked to see the Bloody Mary mix and this shit came in a box. Like what? Lol my friend is slightly dramatic but was choking down her Bloody Mary saying it was so bad she was going to throw up and had to run to the store to get a new drink to wash down the taste. It did suck. We also got slices of pizza which were huuuuge such a good deal, delicious, crispy and just really great especially for Arizona pizza!!! I took a bite of pizza for every sip of the Bloody because it was pretty hard to drink. Overall- yes go to oreganos. But at all costs avoid the bull shit Bloody Mary. Who doesn't make their own mixes these days anyways? It's 2019, let's get with it guys.",

Because the kitchen equipment and working space are shared with Wheat products, Gluten Friendly means that there could be some contamination with Wheat.

My wife had the lasagna and called it the worst lasagna in the world.  I tried a bite and it was horrible.  She at about 1/3 of it and I don't blame her.  Service was poor.  The server never came around to refill my iced tea.  When he brought the check with my empty iced tea glass sitting on the table, I had to ask to have my iced tea filled.  The place wasn't busy, so it's not like the server had other things to do.  He was mostly standing over with other servers doing nothing.  Plus, we had a fly that kept buzzing about our food and I kept swatting at it until I eventually chased it away to someone else's table.  My wife says she'll never eat at an Oregano's again.

    "text": "I love every Oregano's location, but this is the one I visit most frequently, and now mostly takeout since my toddler is a little too active for a busy restaurant. The staff here can't be beat- every single person I make eye contact with says hello, goodbye, or thank you, and it goes a long way. They truly seem happy to be there, so Oregano's- you pick some winners!   My fave flaves are:  - The Numero One-O: But be prepared- I've only had heartburn a handful of times in my life and once was after this pizza, but I don't regret it. The other specialty pizzas are a little too \"weird\" in the toppings for me, so I usually go with one I build myself- simple and tasty. - All the salads. Pablo Picasso has some bite, the Big Dinner Salad is awesome with some chicken on top, and the Antipasto salad is my new favorite- such great flavor!  - All the pasta is good, too, but recently tried Alfredo the Dark and was really surprised how much I liked it- it wasn't \"alfredo-y\" at all- just a lightly creamy pasta with a tiny touch of heat.  Side notes: they will only seat you when the party is present, so make sure your group is on time, or put in an advance order of the Guac-a-Tony, since it takes a while to get to the table. also- check your order if you get takeout- I've had a handful of times where they've missed a side or a dressing, or something... not a huge deal, but they are busy and things happen!",

    "text": "OK, this pains me to write this because I love the food at Oregano's. I have had great service at other Oregano's. The waitstaff at other Oregano's are friendly and fun. I really like Oregano's. But not this Oregano's and not today. My friend, her daughter and I arrived for lunch and were seated right away (very nice). It was not overly busy when we arrived. Our waitress was pleasant but her connecting skills were lacking. Anyway, as we're sitting there, someone tried to sit a fairly obese man at a booth that clearly wasn't going to work and they had to request sitting at a table. I would have been embarrassed that this wasn't treated in a sensitive manner...but that's me. So we order, a salad and a pizza. The salad arrives (again, great food), the pizza arrives and then the \"are you done yet\" kinds of questions began. We really had the sense they wanted us to leave even when we weren't finished (\"can I take your plate, can I box this up, are you done with the salad\") and yet, my water glass (I'm a water freak) was never refilled during the whole lunch.   And then the kicker. The waitress came to remove the pizza pan and knocked over my friend's water (she's not a water freak)--all over her, the table and her daughter. Some even splashed on the table behind us to the point that they had to move those diners to another table. But not us, it was time (not according to us) for us to go. We got some \"sorry\"s from the waitress and manager (?) but no  \"are you OK?\" They gave my friend a towel and that was it. No offer of a dessert, no complimentary \"we are so sorry\" item. To be clear, we weren't looking for feebies but we were looking for better customer service, something that seems to be more and more lacking in some places. The way the water spilling was treated was the way the whole lunch experience was - impersonal, disconnected and inattentive.  I know there are rush times, I know things happen but there needs to be a greater attention to the needs of the diner and their dining experience. Other places (Tempe Oregano's for instance) do a crazy busy amount of business and still are able to make each diner feel important and well taken care of. I hope this Oregano's focuses more on the importance of taking care of their customers but I'm not sure I'll know because I'm pretty sure I won't be back.",

The manager said 25-30 minutes. 30 minutes later we ask for an update and he said oh well it will be at least another 45 minutes.

    "text": "At Oregano's, you will hear that same Louis Prima song on repeat during your entire dining experience, but at least you'll get good service.   Actually, I pretty much love Oregano's for their Aunt Shirley's Gorgonzola pizza an order of their nice, meaty wings with mixed sauce.  Oregano's is one of the only places I've been to that allows you to mix their wing sauces.  I love the Italian Gold wings there, a little sweet, honey-ish, salted perfectly, but I also like the Wings of Fire, the hottest selection there.  But get this, if you ask them, they'll mix the two sauces together, so you get this awesome giant, meaty wing covered in this brilliant sweet and spicy sauce.  It's sort of like sex but only a chicken wing.   I feel like I hear people bitch about the price a lot but to me, it's pretty much perfect for what you get.  It's a littler pricier than a place like Streets of New York, but the service and food is better, it's a little less than somewhere like Pizzeria Bianco or Le Grande Orange, but again, it's a little less, you know, delicious as those places.  It's also a great place to take out of town folk since it's a local chain, yet always consistent and generally there is something everyone will like.  Personally, I don't mind the long waits for a table on the weekends.  Once, I brought an uncle and cousin I hadn't seen in years there and it was actually sort of nice grabbing beers from the bar and catching up while we waited for our table.  In any dining setting, I doubt mind waiting as long as something delivers.   Which the place does.  If you can handle the Louis Prima.",

Sitting at the bar during mid-afternoon, the bartender entertained us with a couple of OMG stories of growing up and working in the mid-western USA.  And the thin crust bacon and pineapple pizza made our day.  Thank you Oregano's Pizza.  BUSINESS COMMENT & RESPONSE:  I strive for 5 as well. For me and reviews, I save 5 star for magical experiences such as zoolights and top of the rock.  It's not quantifiable. It's more like who I am sharing the experience with, if romance is involved, and if the stars are in the exact order/location.  If you study my 70+ reviews, you will see several 5 stars reviews and several 1 star reviews.  Extreme scenarios for both, 5 and 1 star reviews.  Consider, I will return to your restaurant. But unless it's on a date, the 5 star review is not likely.   For a variety of reasons i don't date so much anymore. But for the enterprising, it would be a wise move to hook me up.   Joking!",

I don't know if something's changed, but apparently now it's not possible to exclude peppers from the alfredo sauce that comes with several pastas, including the mac & cheese, which I'm not exactly a fan of.   Every time we've been here before there were no peppers if we ordered the mac traditional style, but now when they brought it loaded with peppers. I asked about it and the waitress said it's not possible to leave them out. The manager even came over and said it can't be done because they get pouches of frozen pre-made sauce or something with the peppers in it - which first off, what restaurant doesn't even make their own sauce and has to rely on frozen crap? And second, when I asked about having the exact same dish with no peppers before, the manager tried to argue with me and say they've been using it for many years and insist that I must be incorrect about our multiple previous experiences at this place.  Very disappointing to say the least, not just that they changed my favorite dish and rely on lower quality products, that's bad enough - but to essentially be called a liar by the management when asking questions about it, that's absolutely absurd. I'd consider trying one of their other pastas, or at least come back for the cookie pizza that is still quite good, however after this experience I'm very hesitant to return again.",

I told her what the employee had said and told my friend to double check. My friend went to the person at the front and the employee said that she thought we wanted a smaller table. We waited around some more. Then, we had another friend check on the reservation and we were told the table was just about ready. It took a little over an hour before we were seated.  I feel like I spent my whole evening at the restaurant. It took about another hour from ordering to get our food. The service seemed very very very slow.  I had the deep dish pizza, but the crust inside was a bit soggy for me. I could only finish a slice and a half. There were 8 slices in the pizza. The pizza was ok. I feel like I've had better tasting pizzas before. A friend ordered the \"Lady is a Scampi\" dish. Then, after that, we ordered the chocolate chip pizookie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate chips. The cookie wasn't cooked all the way and was actually quite mushy when I ate it. The vanilla ice cream was good. All of the menu photos on Yelp are outdated. I have some pictures of the new recent menu.  I liked that they were willing to put the ice cream on the side. Overall the service was quite slow and the food was ok.

Cheese has a little toasty effect yet not burnt. The sausage extends past both ends, they are not stingy with the portion size. Add the waffle fries and wow.  I'm ready to keep exploring the menu. Besides the pizza takes about 30 min to be served.  Jaren our server made the visit enjoyable and kept us informed with the progress of our order. His recommendations were on point.  Restrooms both male and female bathrooms were clean. Two stalls in women and one and one in male. Don't worry my wife went in the female and gave me the low down.  The restaurant set up made me feel like I was walking into an old Italian home(never been BTW). Just imagine it would have that feel.  I'm not sure what I think of that huge table in the entrance for waiting. Almost feels like it's in the way.  Overall I finally feel like this chain could become a choice to grab a bite rather than a place I go because I'm outnumbered.",

    "text": "Quite a let down. We have been to many different locations of Oregano's in the past, and have always had a good to great experience. This time however, it was quite different.   We ordered a thin crust pizza (add your own toppings), house salad, and garlic bread. The salad was huge (order the small to share for 2 as it is so big!) and tasted super fresh. The garlic bread was good - how hard is it to mess that up?? Normally you cannot go wrong with ANY of their pizzas, but maybe this was an \"off\" night for them. The pizza had WAY too much cheese, was undercooked, and this was a thin crust! The flavor of the pizza was off, and was super bland (there was even hardly any sauce on it). Again, I truly hope this was an off night for them and their food, but I would have rather just had a frozen pizza that night and probably eaten more. We were unable to eat even half of our food, before we just got the check and left.   All of the above being said - let me just state that what saved this review and got the extra star to bring it up to 2 was the service. Our server was fantastic and super friendly. He definitely saved the experience for us that evening. We have not given up on Oregano's and will probably try it again in the future, but we truly hope that this was an off night and that it isn't trending downwards. We know the quality is normally much higher.",

There was no wait, in fact it was nice and quiet. They had misters going out in the veranda however we decided to sit inside. We ended up getting the mushroom bowtie pasta bowl and the pesto chicken bowl. Both were extremely delicious and filling. On the side both bowls came paired with garlic bread. The service was very friendly and very prompt. Extremely happy with the overall experience and quality of food. We didn't have enough room for the famous pizza cookie which is a warm cookie freshly baked with scoops of vanilla ice cream on top. I think that's a meal on its own, next time that will be our meal. We are very much looking forward to coming back.",

Pastas come with a yummy piece of garlic bread!   If you're torn between whether or not to order a drink, I would suggest against it. My friend and I both got cocktails that were underwhelming. However, that didn't play into our experience at all since the main event, aka the pasta, was so yummy!",

I had to write something more than a check in because a lot of the people in my circle have been dining at Oregano's lately. And it was a special occasion.  My oldest son turned 20 this past week. I suggested we go out for dinner and God bless him, he chose Oregano's. My son has good taste. Also, I had just dined at the Oregano's near where I live, the night before. Regardless, I knew this would be an awesome time.  Then he chose the Calamari appetizer. More good taste demonstrated. It was as delicious as always! I even let him choose our pizza. He suggested a thin crust Clark Street Meat Pizza. All I could think was \"this is definitely my son\". We ordered a large 18\" pizza and destroyed most of it. I've never selected this one before, but always wanted to. The spicy sausage is outstanding! But so is the capicolla, the salami, the garlic, and all that jazz.  Of course, hanging out with my son made this experience  fun. But not to be forgotten, our waitress Cassie was amazing! She was busy, but she was always nearby and checked in often. Beverages were taken care of, the food was delivered quickly, and she made the meal more enjoyable with just her personality. Ask for Cassie!  Oregano's is known for their food. And I've always enjoyed that. What they also deserve to be recognized for is their consistency and service. We will be back!",

I had never had it before but it sounded fantastic. It was quite expensive, but I understand that you pay more for a delivery service, And guacamole in general. When the food came I was shocked that the pizza chips for the guacamole had chosen baked with a crap ton of raw onion. The chips were described as pizza chips, and never described a crap ton of raw onions on top. I would never ever order that again, and it still smells disgusting in my house with how many onions were on that pizza chip.The Alfredo was fantastic but the appetizer pizza chip with raw onion thing would never make me get delivery from them again.",

I saved half of it for the next day and it was actually a bit better cos the bread had softened up.  The bellinis are strong and only $6.  Apparently they used to have this ravioli dish that was amazing but for some reason they took it off the menu which greatly disappointed my husband so I'm docking a star for that.  The best part is the pizookie of course - and it was that good.  I've had similar at BJ's but this one is much better.",

A friend convinced me to try it again saying that their pasta is much better than their pizza.  I got Mama's Sausage and Peppers.  It was actually pretty good.  How do you mess that up, right?  It was a little confusing when two different people came by to ask if I wanted parmesan cheese on top, the top was already covered with parmesan cheese....  The notorious star of the meal however was the lasagna.  It was hands down the worst lasagna I've ever had.  There was maybe one layer of pasta, a layer of mozzarella on top and a little cheese in the middle, but the bulk of it was several layers of overworked ground meat(?).  It's almost like a huge nasty meatball with some sauce and cheese in different spots that you found in the back of the fridge.  I was going to give 3 stars until later on in the meal I tried a piece of meat that was hanging out in the middle of the plate that didn't have any cheese or sauce to hide behind.  That little morsel of meat lost this place another star.",

The gentleman who greeted me told me he first needed to take a phone order before helping me. No problem I thought, having worked in the restaurant industry myself many years ago, I understand that one may be involved with handling many activities at the same time.   After completing the phone order which took about 5 minutes, the same gentleman told me he was going to go check on my order.  5-10 minutes later, I looked over at the bar and saw that he was mixing cocktails. A few minutes later he returned to the front counter, and instead of helping me, he proceeded to take another phone call, which lasted another 2-3 minutes.    The last straw was that, after completing the 2nd phone call, which seemingly could have been answered by one of the 2 young ladies (hostesses?) , he reached down under the counter, and retrieved my order WHICH HAD BEEN THERE THE ENTIRE TIME.    So I ended up waiting 20 MINUTES to pick up an order that was done at the time I had arrived.  I left feeling like I was treated less than a priority, and the end result was that my food was cold when I got home.    We wont be back!!!",

The Vino Bambino used to be my all time fav. In addition to the cheap lettuce there was hardly anything else in it.  I ended up leaving almost a full bowl of just lettuce.  Pizza was average and our pizza cookie was WAY under cooked today. I know it's supposed to be a little undercooked, but today was bad.  We didn't realize it until our daughter had eaten over half of it.  Sadly she threw it up on the way home.  Totally bummed-a year ago this place would have been 5 stars all the way :/",

    "text": "I get a craving to come here about every other week.  Their food is consistently fantastic, even with their large, diverse menu.  The pizzas are fresh and unusual (Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato ... potatoes?  On PIZZA?  Who would have guessed that would be so fantastic?).  The pasta is full of garlic and flavor.  The wings are crispy and perfect.  The sandwiches are huge and tasty.  I could go on.  I've never had anything there that wasn't terrific!  Now, since the food is so good and the atmosphere so fun, and since everyone KNOWS that (due to reviews like the one you're reading now), be prepared to wait.  If you get there around 7:00 any given night, you should be prepared to wait about a half hour.  If you arrive at the same time on a weekend night, your wait could be over an hour.  Parking at the Tempe and Old Town Scottsdale locations is tight (as the Phoenix area tries to grow up and become a real city, this is inevitable, and will be more and more common), but it's better at the Mesa and Gilbert spots.  And since the food is fresh, you naturally have to wait longer for food that takes longer to prepare, such as the wings or the deep dish pizzas.  Okay, you've been warned.  Believe me (and I'm one of Earth's least patient people), the wait will be worth it.",

With that said, my boyfriend and i ordered to-go and everything was absolutely perfect till we sat down to eat. It was soooooo...ICKY, for lack of better words. We ordered the calamari, Alfredo the dark, and the bbq pizza. The calamari tasted like it had been fried in bad dirty oil, the pasta was just pretty much tasteless.....like REALLY tasteless, and the thin crust pizza was soggy and had way too much oregano or parsley or whatever that herb crap was that was DUMPED on top. Needless to say, i don't permit myself to eat a ton of carbs so when i do get that ONE DAY A WEEK, I hope for it to be phenomenal but will settle for edible.....and that stuff was not.  Ok so since my rating of one star, I have decided to go back and change my opinion and here is why. About two days after my post, the manager contacted me via email in an attempt to make it right. I don't see myself taking him up on his offer ( a gift card to Oregano's) but the fact he expressed concern and legitimately wanted to fix the problem says alot about their willingness to correct any mishap you may have.  Sooooo with that said i give them three stars, not the best food but great customer relations.",

My brother has tried to take me to an Oregano's for a while, but there is always an insane wait at whatever one we have attempted. Since it was an early weekday afternoon, I suggested this new one in Mesa since there was bound NOT to be a wait-and we were right!  We entered and this place is pretty spacious. They asked if we wanted to eat at the bar-but to tell the truth it looked like on of the most unappealing bars I had ever seen. It reminded me of the Barbie's McDonald play set I had as a kid. Plastic-y and just kind of kitchy-and not in the good way. No thanks. We were led through the restaurant and I have to admit it reminded me of a Pizza Hut. Hmm... we opted for outside but kind of regreted it since it was hot out and the misters didn't do much.  The table was kind of large and I felt like my bro and I were at a conference table waiting for a terribly important meeting. The host was friendly and wanted our drink order kind of fast-but since it was my first time, I told him that. He then proceeded to tell me ALL the drinks. I mean ALL of them. I wished I had kept my mouth shut and just found the last page of the menu that listed drinks, since he proceeded to list them off verbatim. While he sat at our table. Kind of awkward. Am I being too east coast about this? After all that, got a Fat Tire and then proceeded to look over the menu. As a vegetarian and lactose intolerant, going to Italian restaurants is kind of dumb for me, I admit. I mean I can eat pizza, but it just doesn't bode well.   I settled for the Pasta Basta, penne with feta cheese, pine nuts, olives, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, olive oil and with a slice of garlic bread. It was a little spicy, but pretty tasty and not a bad deal for 8 bucks. I had some left over and the garlic bread toasted well the day after.  I just wasn't super impressed. It was a good solid restaurant, one you could bring grandman, your ma, a study group, kids, whatever, which is nice, right? But I found the service to be way too familiar and way too friendly (which sounds crazy, and trust me, I didnt think that was possible until I went here). I understood finally why children are scared of clowns after coming here. Someone being overly nice and cheerful is just kind of eerie.",

Yesterday was my first time dining at oregano's with a group of church people and wasn't impressed.    First thing I do when I go to a restaurant is take a look in the bathroom.  As I walk across the threshold of the bathroom door.  A great breeze of old, milky, soggy urine smell just went up my nostrils.  What a great first impression huh?    Well after sniffing of the urine breeze experience I was wondering how a manager can keep a restroom so dirty like that.  Well my hands are washed and starving to death.  The waitress was very attentive of me and ask me what I wanted to drink as I sat down.  Of course I always get the free H2O and I just ordered the meatball sandwich (took some advice from a friend) and one of good friends ordered the calamari.  My friends calamari came out before my dish came out.  The calamari looked a bit weird shaped (like a cheeto puffs) and I kept looking at it.  My friend offered me one and I accepted.  GROSS!! What was this I was tasting? Processed meat.... that's all I have to say.  Nothing remotely resembling calamari.  After that experience my food came up and just by the appearance of it.  The meatballs were dry, and I was right.  Nasty calamari and dry meatballs... What a great combination.  Next time maybe I'll try the pizza as people are ranting about it on yelp.",

Crust is exactly like soggy cardboard. Taste is nasty too! I love olive oil but they take it to an extreme! For the cost of this mass-produced garbage, they don't put on much topings either. Asked the server to take it back 'cause the crust was raw, uncooked, soggy to the point it was falling apart... All they did was heat it some more and bring me the same garbage back! To top off the insult, they'll make you wait an hour for it too! Staff frequently ignore customers. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AT THIS PLACE!",

We went here very early (~4 PM) for our large party to get seated and there wasn't too much of a wait, but if I have to always go here at 4 to be seated without a really long wait, there's no way I would eat here.  We had an appetizer, pizza, and dessert.  The appetizer was the GuacaTony, which was amazing.  It had a very large portion of fresh guacamole with perfectly crispy cheesy pizza/flatbread to eat it with.  I also had some of the toasted ravioli which was nicely breaded and toasty, with a bit of spicy kick to it.  I wasn't too impressed with the pizza though.  We had ordered a pizza on the thin crust wheat, and it looked like a bunch of pizza toppings placed on a large, circular cracker.  The wheat crust was not very flavorful and was burnt in a few areas.  The pizza cookie was rich, decadent, and delicious, although I highly recommend sharing this with at least 2 other people.",

There is one in Mesa, now, very close to me, and the ambiance remains the same.  I love the vintage decoration, the music, usually Ella Fitzgerald and other jazz icons, and the FOOD!  All the appetizers are amazing, especially the Boom Dip.  My favorite pizza is the O-Riva.  And passing up the Pizzookie (pizza cookie) is out of the question, get your friends to dive into this amazing desert.  Also the bellinis are outstanding!  Enjoy your experience here, you will fall in love! Have patience at the smaller locations, usually there will be a wait.",

They have fabulous pastas and pizza's, salads etc.  We always look forward to eating their pizza cookies... big cookie with vanilla ice cream on top.  Couldn't ask for anything better.  They have seating outside and inside and you also have the option of eating at the bar which is quicker.  We always ,have great service although some of their pizzas etc take a little longer to cook.  Sometimes when you are with a preschooler it's hard to wait.  We come here every now and then because it's very hard to get seated right away because they are always so packed and don't take reservations.  We live closer to the Tempe location, but sometimes go to the Mesa one because it's a shorter wait.",

I went with a group and the wait staff and manager were very rude. We were  ready for a fun night and unfortunately this experience put a huge damper on the evening. I would not recommend this place for any group, EVER. I would put zero stars if possible. When I spoke with the Manager she said she would discount the bill, however when I looked at the bill closer I realized she had discounted the bill, but also added a 20% gratuity for a party of 5, when I asked her to remove the gratuity and keep the discount she refused.  Manger, Cher (I think that was her name), thanks for not handling this appropriately, I will be sending a letter to your corporate office.",

Inside, it looked just like every other Oregano's:  spacious, a little dark, a lot of leg room in the booths, and tables aplenty.  It wasn't busy at all around this time, so we were promptly seated by a friendly host.  Our server was nothing to write home about.  She was nice enough, but we have all been around people who clearly are phony, almost to the point of being farcical in their niceties.  This was our waiter.  Her smile was forced.  Her asking to refill our drinks seemed laborious.  I could have done without her.  I don't like phony.  I ordered their chicken Caesar salad, and my husband ordered two slices of pieces and a salad.  His food looked great.  He said he liked it.  My salad was mediocre.  It was fresh; the chicken was fresh.  But there was nothing that made the taste stand out.  It tasted no better than anything I could have gotten at Denny's.  I'll just stick with the one in Tempe.",

    "text": "Sadly, we called ahead to place an order for pick up (it was a girl who took our order) and once we got there, the take out gal was very disrespectful and aggressive in the fact that we \"were wrong\" and supposedly we didn't call ahead with an order. She then suggests that someone else \"must not have written down the order\". This was last night 1/17/2018 at roughly 8pm. Thus, we showed her the conversation history on my call log and she couldn't deny it at that point. So, we placed the order again and waited 20 minutes in the lobby. The whole time we were there she was the only girl working 'take out' so we knew it was her that didn't want to take responsibility which is frustrating. Moreover, she was frantically counting her cash at the register and tip jar the whole time. Finally, once we got our food, she didn't give us any utensils, napkins or the side for a dish. This was such a bad experience and very sad since I've been going to the other Oreganos locations for nearly 10 years without ever having any issues. This was my first and last time and this location. I would give this review negative stars if possible because of that girl.",

It actually was about 30 minutes.BUT we were seated at a long picnic table with another couple at the other end. That wasn't really that bad, there was quite a bit of space between us, but then some obtuse guy plopped drink then his body at our table while he talked to his friends. Incredibly rude on his part. Our waiter saw him and said nothing. I mentioned it to him and he was like \"sorry\" but didn't offer to ask him to move. It ruined our dinner. We had pizza. They said it was \"Chicago style\". I'm from Illinois and I'm pretty sure the only thing \"Chicago style\" was old time Dominos. The toppings were pretty good but the crust was cracker style on the edges and a bit soggy in the center. We didn't try the deep dish pizza, so it might have qualified as Chicago style.",

The service is always good, even when the restaurant and bar are packed. I've even had a server quickly turn an eat-in order into a takeout order (due to an emergency call) without blinking an eye. The wait can be quite long no matter the hour or location, so go completely outside of meal hours or expect to stand around in a parking lot.  The food isn't that great. The thin crust pizza is typically overcooked. The baked pasta is just so-so and too generously portioned, always baked with too much cheese. The marinara sauce is overly seasoned, perhaps in homage to their consistently over-the-top style. I do like their meatballs, which unfortunately are bigger than a child's fist. The meatball sandwich suffers from too much cheese (none would be a good amount), but tastes good.  I think my general malaise regarding Oreganos has to do with their menu. It is ridiculously large both in terms of size and options, most of which do not appeal to me. Everything seems too big, too complicated, too daunting, too smothered. If I had to build my preferred meal, it would be a half of a junior sized Mediterranean salad, one meatball, and a side of sweet potato fries. Knowing that I'll probably go back, I'll try to order it.",

The ziti is a favorite of mine, not only because ziti is just really good, but it also comes in a bread bowl! I recently found out that you can ask for any pasta in a bread bowl too! The food is great to start, but the Pizza Cookie...now we're talking! I always go for half peanut-butter half chocolate chip! YUUUUUM",

    "text": "Oregano's has outstanding pizza.  Hands down.  Enough said.    My absolute favorite is the Bistro Classic with added banana peppers, pepperoni, and sausage.  It has a very thin crust so two people can actually eat a large (oh my god I admitted that...we do take some home okay) without feeling disgusting.  That said, I've never made it to dessert.    Their salads are awesome as well.  My favorite is the Antipasto Thing.    I think the best thing about this location is the waitress that we always hope we get.  I shamefully don't know her name but she is easy to recognize.  She's really tall and skinny with dark brown hair and funny as hell.  The first time we went there she sat down at our table and told us a joke.  The next time we had her we made her sit down to tell us a joke.  And she was funny both times.  You might have to wait if you get there around lunch or dinner time.  Every time I've been to any of their locations they have been packed.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "I have been eating at Oregano's for many years. My all-time favorite dish is the Big Rig pasta.  It is a creamy pasta with a delicious kick of cilantro.  I also love the pesto penne bake (pesto and pasta in bread bowl) as well as the bollo pasta (unlimited pasta with delicious marinara sauce).  For an appetizer I love the calamari and the cheesy garlic bread.  The pazookie is the perfect dessert-  hot, soft, partially cooked cookie with ice cream on top.  The prices are good and you will have leftovers to take home.",

    "text": "Oreganos is amazing no matter which location you visit, but this one is the creme de la creme. The staff are so fantastic they could serve liver and onions and I would still come as much as I do, which is embarrassingly often. On one of my first times eating here, we left and our waiter chased us out with my son's bottle that was left on the table. We thanked him, got in the car and started to drive away, and he came running up with my son's backpack. We thanked him (again) and parked to make sure we hadn't absentmindedly left anything else. We got back in the car and got ready to turn onto the road, and there he was again with our debit card. Needless to say we were super surprised with the amazing service despite our extreme forgetfulness. They have continued time and time again to provide a great experience. And I haven't even started on the food!!!! Delicious! Make sure you get dessert!",

I highly recommend the bistro classic pizza, the pesto penne bake and the  pizza cookie for dessert.  Service was god and I did not have to wait for a table at this location. Both visits were after 8 PM.",

    "text": "I been to five different Oregano's in the Valley and although I've had bizarre experiences at three of them, some of it was due to the company I was with and not the actual restaurant itself.  As a native northeasterner who appreciates traditional NY style Neopolitan pizza, I'm not a big thick crust/pan pizza guy. Oregano's pan pizza is different though.  Their smallest pie can fill up two people and unlike Pizza Hut (not that I actually eat there), the crust is never greasy and with topping choices like cajun chicken or sundried tomatoes, who can complain?   Their house salad is great with lettuce options more exotic than your standard iceberg and excellent dressings. Chicken wings are also very good with a mustard flavor that tastes a lot better than it sounds.   Most customers hate surprises. At Oregano's they avoid surprises by telling you the wait time for a table or that pan pizzas take 35-40 minutes to cook.  I was at the Mesa restaurant on a weekday and our pizza was taking forever. We began dozing off at the table when our server came to us and told us the cooks forgot about us and there will be no charge for the whole meal (including salad we ate earlier) and did we still want to eat the pizza here or take it to go?  It was after 11 pm on a Wed. Following that a manager came to us and told us how he felt when a restaurant when he's in a restaurant and things go wrong and how he reacts to the staff (keep in mind we never complained or even asked about when our pizza was coming). He gives his apologies and tells us a desert cookie will be made for us while our pizza is being finished. That was also going to be free.   After eating our pizza and sharing the only desert they serve (a large homemade cookie served in the pan it was cooked in with lumps of ice cream on top) we tried to leave a tip on our zero balance bill that the waitress didn't even seem interested in accepting.   Despite the wait, it was a pleasant experience that someone could realize something was wrong and do something about it without you having to tell them.   I've also eaten at the North Scotts location, Old Town, Camelback and University in Tempe. All are pretty standard in quality.  If I have some criticism it is that I like my pizza toppings on top of my pizza. At Oreganos they go under the cheese, which makes it hard to get crispy.   This sometimes prevents me from ordering meats like pepperoni or ground beef. That's okay though, because I like the vegetable options too.   Also, I've waited nearly an hour on multiple occasions at the Mesa location to get a pan pizza. Other locations are usually closer to their 35 minute estimation.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying I have never written a review.  I eat out TONS and have a few choice restaurants I love.  I shop on Amazon like its my job... I read the reviews, but never actually review.  Having said that, I wanted to take the time to let people know what a wonderful experience I had Oreganos on Dobson.  I go to Oreganos all over the Phoenix Valley... Mostly Tempe on University and Phoenix on Camelback. I (generally) get the Big Beefstro Salad... Solid choice for those of you that have never experienced it... Ah-mazing.  Moving on... My server was Kim, she was DELIGHTFUL. Attentive, friendly, just all around a great server.  And the salad?  Best I ever had.  I would like to take this opportunity to commend Oscar, the salad guru in the back.  The most magnificent I've ever had it, ever!! My boyfriend got the Big Rig, and he can't stop comparing other rigatoni dishes to it; it, too, was far above the normal Oreganos deliciousness (which is already pretty up there).  Kudos to Kim and Oscar, job well done and thank you for making my experience so wonderful.",

    "text": "First of all, the only two bad things about this place are the parking and the wait. But with food this good, who cares???   I like to try something different most times and everything I've tried has been fantastic! Go with friends so you can try lots of things.   Start with the KickBUTT Garlic Bread with cheese. I could just eat this! For salads, my favorite is the Vino Bambino...salad, pasta, beans, chicken, cheese, onions, red peppers. Just YUM!   For the pasta, Pesto Penne Bake is at least two meals! It comes in a huge bread bowl that is so tasty itself. The Big Rig Pasta is also a huge hit.   The different pizzas are also fantastic, but if you are going to go with a pizza-ish thing, go with the Ozone Calzone. So melty and cheesy and just so freaking good!   Go with my favorite drink, the Bellini! A tasty frozen mix of champagne, peaches, raspberries and all sorts of other tasty stuff! They limit you to two, but it's worth it. Lucky I'm withing walking distance!   YOU MUST YOU MUST YOU MUST!!! Finish your meal with their Pizza Cookie. You can choose chocolate chip, peanut butter or white chocolate macadamia nut. We usually get half peanut butter/half chocolate chip. Ooey, gooey, hot, ice creamy goodness!!   The service is always fantastic as well! My friends and I had the displeasure of going last year once when their A/C was out. In July. Despite the fact that everyone was miserable, the staff still had great spirits and was right on the ball with everything. So much so that I felt the need to send in a positive letter about the staff despite us being miserable.  Go, eat, drink, LOVE IT!",

    "text": "We have been to this location many times, and this last time WILL be our last time there. First, the music was extremely loud therefore everyone in the restaurant was shouting to be heard. Next our waitress took our drink order and order she already had 5 tables and then they gave her a 15 person table on top of that! So we couldn't get her attention for anything we needed. Next, the manager brought our food out (because waitress was too busy) I ordered the Italian wedding soup and when the manager went to put it down he dumped a bunch of scolding hot soup all over my lap!!!! He looked at me, said that he was sorry and left the table. Not making sure I was ok or anything. I was extremely upset and when the waitress came again, I expressed my concern and she said she would let him know. We were at the restaurant for a good 2 hours and he never came back to our table! We got our check, nothing was taken off. At this point we were livid. How extremely rude to not address an issue that was brought up! My husband paid the check and I went to the car and he pulled the manager aside to address this. The manager had many excuses and said he was too busy to get back to us. Just like we will be too busy to ever return here. He eventually comped the soup and appetizer, which was a pitiful portion of our bill, but at least it was something. It's obvious that this man was a poor manager who does not care about customer service.",
