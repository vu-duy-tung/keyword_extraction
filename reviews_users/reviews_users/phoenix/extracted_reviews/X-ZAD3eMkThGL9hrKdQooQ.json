Just lets you know how \"Old Willy lynch\" is still holding people from getting into a better predicament or at least a meal from someone who was willing to pay! At the same time he lost a valuable customer (s) .Next time if someone is cramping your style Big Joe call the police instead of assuming people will look down on you because you serve someone of a lower class.",

My two buddies and I each enjoyed orders of two catfish pieces that also came with three shrimp, drinks and one side. we got fried okra, sweet potato tots, collard greens and an extra order of jalapeno hush puppies. The cost was very affordable at about $28 total. It was fantastic! The fish pieces were actually fillets that appeared to be very fresh, lightly dusted with breading and lightly fried. We got the spicy with is more of just some added pepper but it's delicious.   Comparing this to somewhere like Pete's Fish and Chips seems laughable as this is everything Pete's should be but isn't. The breading here is not overstated, everything seems fresh, it's delicious and you get a lot for around $8 per person. I'll definitely be back and I highly recommend Papa Joe's to everyone reading this review!",

I got the 3 piece catfish with 4 shrimp meal with fried okra. I opted for the spicy version and it was just the right amount of spice.. Not too hot but just enough to taste.  Lightly battered with cornmeal and amazingly good. The shrimp were good but nothing compared to the fish and okra.  Now for the okra..OMG..lightly battered with great mix of seasoning made this some of the best I've had. Portions are large..I had one piece of fish leftover.   There is also a lot of BBQ dishes and countless other options and sides. The guy who took our order which I'm assuming would have been the owner was super friendly and very enthusiastic about food. Very reasonable prices with a casual atmosphere.   A great little find and I will definitely visit here many times in the future.",

I ordered the one-piece catfish combo; this included a humongous fillet of catfish. Good thing I decided to order only one piece; two would have been too much for me, even though an additional filet would not have cost much more. The combo also included some fried shrimp, a side (I chose potato salad), and a drink (iced tea for me). The catfish was really good - the fillet was tender, hot, and  juicy and was covered with a light, crunchy batter. They gave me 3 fried shrimp instead of the 2 that was supposed to come with the combo - I'm not complaining about that ;) and the potato salad was quite good. Everything - including the drink - for $6.05 plus tax. It's rare to come across a place that serves food this good and tasty for so little money.",

Took me forever to find them, especially since the Maps app takes you to the hospital parking lot.   That out of the way, I arrived with a mean craving for catfish. I opted for the three piece, which came with four shrimps, a side and a drink. At about $12, that seemed reasonable enough.   I ordered to go, so I didn't get the in house dining experience. It is very casual. There were a few tables seated when I arrived, and a few people in the back were watching the game on the television set hanging nearby. Total family diner style.   It took about 10 minutes for my order to arrive. I found that the shrimps were perfectly seasoned. They were just...just so delicious. The catfish was curious. Of note, Papa Joe's has the seasoning and batter on point! It was so light and fresh! As though they grew the plants for the seasoning out back. But, strange thing, the catfish did not taste like catfish. It looked like catfish and smelled like catfish, but it was so very, very light. That was the only downfall. Other than that, very nice find.",

    "text": "My wife happens to be from the South.   So after we de-planed at PHX and picked up our rental, she naturally found this place on Yelp as we driving!  Papa Joe's isn't in the most glamorous part of Phoenix.  In fact, you may feel a little nervous around this neighborhood.  My wife and I didn't have any trouble though.   We parked in the strip mall parking lot where Papa Joe's is.   Walking inside, this a hole-in-the-wall mixed in with some down home love.   Papa Joe's is a very nice, gracious man.   And his son is really great too.   My wife did all the ordering:  6 pieces of catfish, 2 orders of fried okra, an order of peach cobbler and an order of fried green tomatoes.   Now unlike my wife, I'm in LA boy.   When I first heard my wife utter \"catfish,\" I was already thinking about how it was going to taste like it had sand in it.   I also wasn't too thrilled that everything ordered was fried, except for the cobbler.    But I worried for nothing... The food here is amazing.    The fried catfish was so damn good, that I've told so many people about it.   I can't wait until my next business trip into Phoenix and Scottsdale to go back here.    The okra, tomatoes, and cobbler were off the charts too.   If you're from the South, or are looking for some good cooking, you have to come here.",

    "text": "Thanks to Yelpers, I found a great place again. I was just driving through Phoenix on a long trip form Texas to California and I needed a place to get dinner after 9 hours of driving. I had a hankering for BBQ. When I saw that they had fish and BBQ, it peaked my interest. After a 6 mile drive from the hotel, I found the location and it looked nice from the outside. The construction on the street almost made me merge to the left which would be the wrong side.  Anyhow, as I walked in and saw the ordering counter on the left, I was greeted (by Joe?) and asked what I wanted. I wanted to try the Spicy cod and I wanted ribs. He recommended the Fish and Shrimp plate and I could get ribs for $2 each. So that's what I did. He asked if I wanted fries and I asked what he would recommend. He said the okra. Okra it is!  As I waited, I noticed the inside was cozy and kept nice and clean. There's a drink bar where you can get anything you want and the food prep happened right across the room. While trying to move into a position to see the TV better, I spilled my tea. Joe was more than gracious and came over to clean it up with out incident. I tried the tea and the lemonade. I like it when a BBQ place lets you get all the drink you want. That's the way it should be!  When my food came, I wasn't disappointed. There were 2 pieces of cod, 3 shrimp and okra. There was also some cocktail sauce and 3 packets of tartar. As for the ribs, they were nice and big, probably 7-8 inches each. They were covered in a delicious sauce. Both had some spicy pickled peppers as well.   The Fish was nice and thick at about 1 inch! It was cooked very well and the batter was light. I ordered the spicy, but it wasn't too spicy for me. That was fixed with some hot sauce. The shrimp were good, about average. The okra was seasoned very well. I didn't need to dip it in anything. The ribs were delicious. Nice and meaty and a good smoky taste. I really liked the sauce as well. It had a great mix of spicy sweet and accented the ribs quite well.   So the entire bill was about $15.00. Recall I ordered a combination and the extra ribs. It's not a bad deal at all considering the amount and quality if the food and the fact that it also included a drink. I can highly recommend this place. Yum.",

I took my mother to the eye Dr. today and thought it would be nice to go out for lunch after. This place popped into my mind because, once again. I had driven by just the night before.          We went in and checked out the menu on the wall. After going through about everything I ordered the catfish and shrimp as well as the 2 piece ribs combo. My mother ordered the catfish as well with the potato salad. Food came out pretty fast and I dug in. The catfish was fantastic!!! I ordered the spicy and it was full of flavor and cooked very well. I then reached over and tried the ribs. This was the only thing that did not floor me. They were very good but a bit to peppery for me. Good size ribs with lots of meat but still maybe a 3 on the 5 star scale.       The sides were wonderful. I had the onion rings and the okra with one order and the mac and cheese with the other. All of which were excellent. My mother loved her catfish and shrimp. Which reminds me, my shrimp was very good and would love a big plate of those guys.         All in all I would strongly recommend Papa Joe's. I will be back for more of that catfish and just about everything else I can try.   One last thing, the pecan pie was excellent. I could not resist. I wanted to try the sweet potato pie but they were out so I had the pecan instead. I was not unhappy with my choice.",

    "text": "let me preface this by saying that it is rare to find a restaurant in phoenix that has character and personality.  you go in and ask an employee what they like and what you should order to get a good idea of this place..they stare blankly or respond 'i dont know everything is good.'  Being from dallas i was so used to restaurants that have people with a genuine love for what they do and the business they represent.  Which leads me to Papa Joe's.  This place was amazing.  I asked the gentleman at the front counter and told him it was my first time there and what he suggested that I order.   \"one piece fish three shrimp, pork rib, hot link. fries.'  so thats what i got.  had a good conversation with the man who was from texas as well football and whatnot.  good texas homecooking.  heh.  i ordered to go  but enjoyed my ten minutes of waiting for the food talking to the staff and even talking to the man's wife whom he introduced me to.  he said i would enjoy the good homecooking being from texas and all.  this food blew my mind.  atmosphere was great.  staff was incredible.  food was to die for.  go.  seriously. price was ridiculously cheap.  paid around 9.00 or so for all of that food and a drink.  cheaper than anywhere else in town.  the ONLY negative is that i couldn't stop myself from eating until i was sickeningly full.  seriously.  it's that good.",

First, I prefer my sandwich on sliced bread and not a bun and I expected two pieces of fish for a sandwich versus one piece received. The mac & cheese i'm sure is prepared either daily (at least I hope) or it was from the day before, very average. I ate one of the onion rings, cause I had enough of the fried food taste from the fish.  Be prepared to wait upwards of 15mins for your ordered main dish, cause again the sides are pre made and sitting in a warming container. I'm still looking for a good soul food spot.",

After looking at the reviews and photos I just had to give it a try.  I am glad we did.  Best fish and chips I have ever had in Phoenix in a long time.  There's been a few places in the past that were good but sea food places are not very big here.  Too many taco, pizza and sub shops.  I will be coming back to try other menu items. We had the 3-piece regular cod, four-piece shrimp and large fries.  Also, a side of mac and cheese which was good.  It comes with regular size drink.  Bill total was $40.10.  $14.48(fish, shrimp and fries) +1.99(extra fries) +1.99(mac and cheese) =$18.46 x 2=$36.92+$3.18 tax=$40.10.",

The catfish / catfish nuggets are BOMB - and I don't have much to compare it to not having had much catfish, but the seasoning and flavor are out of this world.  The mac n' cheese was good and so were the greens but I didn't care for the okra (mushy) or the coleslaw (he puts sweet relish in it - and sweet relish ruins anything for me)... hush puppies were worth trying - but you absolutely must try the catfish.  I tried one of his wings - and it's not your average wing - it's practically half the damn bird.  Again, the seasoning was perfect and it was cooked to perfection.  We were greeted and our order was taken by Papa Joe himself.  Whenever I meet a local business owner who knows his product is money and yet remains humble and down to earth I'm instantly a fan.  He had a few recommendations - which reminds me, they have like four different kinds of Kool-Aid on tap and I suggest the cherry limeade.  This place is legit and I will most definitely be back!!",

After walking in I noticed it is a counter service only restaurant that centers on seafood and BBQ but the menu has more seafood items than BBQ. Because of that I decided on fried fish and ordered the whiting which came with one side and I chose fried okra. I then decided to also try their baked beans as another side that I paid extra for.   The food arrived about 15 minutes later. The whiting was excellent! The flavor along with being fried properly allowed me to really enjoy that fish (4.5). The fried okra was good and I rated them at (3.5). The beans were ok and I gave them a 3.   The owner was taking orders at the cashier stand and was very friendly. This is a place you come to that is laid back and casual for a good meal. While there I got the impression it is a popular neighborhood spot which is good. I wish I could have tried some of their Q but the whiting really was excellent!",

Small joint in a strip mall next to a quaint grocery store and barber shop, right off historic Bethany Home Road. Very nice people behind the counter and seemed like a down home family establishment.   The lady behind the counter was very helpful in my decision to get the spiced cod and my buddy insisted I got the fried Okra (my first time). And I HAD to get the corn bread!  The food came and it looked like it was prepared with love and carefully placed on the plate. Everything was amazing! My buddy got the catfish and he thought it was amazing as well. And the hot sauce is to die for!  Would recommend, 10/10. I will be back",

It is a simple place in a strip center and I probably wouldn't have just stopped by, had I not read the reviews. We had the spicy catfish and the cod. I had the okra which is one of my favorite things in the world and it was very good. It was not greasy and everything was freshly made. We were greeted with a smile and made to feel very welcome. We definitley will be back.",

Large portion size, recommend 1 fish not two, so full! My only concern was we got mild not spicy on the fish and it still was a bit spicy for us! We both suffer from heartburn so try to eat less spice! But never the less everything was tasty! Really far from home but if in area would visit again!",

Haven't tried the burgers, but I have to imagine they're great, too. So that's atmosphere, service, food. Now... price. Really, really reasonable for a fish house. Had a 3-piece catfish dinner (they all include 3 fried butterflied shrimp) with onion rings, and the catfish nuggets with hushpuppies, 2 fountain drinks - $22. Yeah... $11 each. That's about half of what you might pay elsewhere. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "That's what it'll be I said to myself as I drove the 20 miles down to the Doctors office from NW Phoenix, Papa Joe's Fish and 'Cue!  I had read the Yelp reviews and had wanted to go for weeks now.  So on the way back from sitting for 30 minutes in an MRI tube, I stopped at what I was sure was going to be a grand slam.  Kind of a rough part of Bethany Home Road but I figured it should be ok and it was, don't let it scare you off.  Walked in and the place was full of people but no one had any food in front of them and since it was nearly 1 PM, I figured everyone is already done with lunch (wrong).  Ordered the brisket sandwich and two sides for around $6.50, reasonable enough and even comes with a drink.  I was order #17.  I waited for my to-go order by the side counter.  After about 10 minutes they called #10 and that was my first red flag.  I thought this could be awhile.  Sure enough a few minutes later they called #11, then #13.  Twenty minutes in they called #8 and it was pretty obvious they lacked institutional restaurant control.  One of the patrons walked up to the counter and asked for his money back, that he couldn't wait anymore.  I asked how long he had been waiting and he said an hour and a half.  At 35 minutes and really late for work I asked for my money back and they said it was coming right out.  Oops, turns out #14 was coming out not #17.  At that point I just walked out with the nice lady behind the counter telling me she would give me my money back.  I just kept walking and will dispute the charge later with AmEx.  They seemed like really nice people, the place was clean, and (supposedly) the food is good.   The questions you have to ask yourself is, \"Do I feel lucky?\" and \"Do I have the disposable time to wait up to 90 minutes for BBQ\" -especially when Bobby-Q's is a mile up the road and I can get my meal in under 5 minutes.  Very disappointing.",

    "text": "First of all I want to counter comment the review from Brittney S.  You went to this place 3 times as you stated and I would hope knew it was a Soul Food place... Therefore alot of fried food. They don't offer smothered there either. If you don't like it, don't go... They didn't force you to order fattening item's feel your review was not accurate.   Anyway, we went on Saturday Oct 8th. Being a girl from the South I am always on the look out for good Southern/Soul food places everywhere. There are not too many in the Phoenix area. \"Mo\" took our order and recommended some items for me. He was nice and very helpful. We also met the owner \"Papa Joe\" who was very nice and very appreciative of our patronage. I ordered the pulled brisket sandwich, mac and cheese, greens, corn bread and sweet potato pie. The sandwich reminded me of Texas style BBQ. The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious. The greens were seasoned and delicious as well. The corn bread and desert was also equally pleasing.  My boyfriend ordered the ribs, fried okra, jalapeno hush puppies. The sauce on the ribs was tasty and have black pepper in the sauce, the ribs fell apart they were so tender. The okra was not too breaded and was cooked perfect. The hush puppies were great and not spicy hot like one might think. Over all we will go back, it was great food and the staff were nice to us. I do recommend checking this place out if you want a little soul in your hole.....",

Each time I've been to Papa Joe's I have ordered the one piece spicy catfish (which isn't spicy) and two shrimp. The plate comes with fries, but you can substitute for a different side. I recommend the jalapeno hush puppies. They aren't spicy, like the jalapeno would indicate and are addictively yummy.  I've never had the pulled pork sandwich, but my husband has and says it's really good.   They make home made sweet potatoe pie, which I have yet to try, but I certainly will soon as it looks soooo good.

Has a warm and nice touch and flare for New Orleans decor. Being a BAMA girl..I love my fried catfish and shrimp..so that is what I tried. After talking to Janet ( her family owns & works Papa Joe's) she told me the catfish is fresh and hand seasoned (to perfection, I might add) They have several catfish and shrimp options...I went with the 3 piece Catfish w/ 4 fried shrimp...it normally comes with french fries, but Janet said I could have my choice of a side instead. Which I opted for because my mouth was already watering for the mac and cheese...I also added a side of turnip greens and a slice of pecan pie. What is really a nice surprise..the cold drink comes with the combo meal..and they threw in a free piece of cornbread, wrapped in a cupcake wrapper. OK...I rolled up my sleeves and dug in!! OH LAWD...the catfish is to die for...perfectly seasoned and fried...3 huge whole catfish fillets, (no half fillets here) Dang! it was so delicious...I had to stop myself from eating the last fillet..cuz, I wanted some for dinner later. The shrimp is just as great..steaming hot and perfectly cooked! The mac n cheese is creamy and cheesy and heart stoppingly addictive..not overcooked and bland. My turnip greens were just glistening in their pot likkor, to which i let my cornbread sop up that delicious elixir..and then when no one was looking..I picked up the bowl and drank with delight the yummy pot likkor from the greens!! I could not stop smiling..while eating my gastronomic delight...it just made me so happy. I just had to meet Rodney (he's Janet's son and was in the front making some fries) and Papa Joe.. ( the owner and names sake) was very friendly..to tell them how delicious their labor of love was!! A very nice, warm and friendly family...where you can tell they put their heart and SOUL..into this wonderful little gem of a Fish n Que joint! I highly recommend the catfish, shrimp, greens, mac n cheese, and pecan pie!! i didn't have my glasses with me..so I couldn't read the full menu..BUT..I know they have some wonderful  BBQ...and maybe next time (if I can get passed that catfish) I will try some of their BBQ'd items! Definitely 2 THUMBS UP and a 5 star review from this satisfied localvor (local) eater!! I will be blogging on my Face book page and sharing Papa Joe's Fish n Que Restaurant! P.s. I only came to know about this gem..through the Living Social Coupon...and I'm so glad I did!! You won't be disappointed!! I\"m glad I bought 2 of those Living Social Coupons..I will Definitely be back for more!! Thank you!  EAT LOCAL!!!",

Papa Joe's catfish hit the mark: fresh, flaky, lightly breaded with a bit of spice in the mix, and perfectly cooked.  I'm sooo happy to have found this place.  It is definitely more of a southern type of joint than typical northwestern fish and chips with clam chowder and beer batter.  Papa Joe's instead offers a variety of comfort food sides including sweet potato tots, Mac and cheese, or fried okra. No chowder. They do have a full BBQ menu too, which we didn't try.  3 of us ate well for under $25.  We will definitely go back.",

    "text": "CATFISH!  After being prompted by a friend to check this place out for months and being in the area, I decided to give it a shot. Although I've enjoyed catfish before, I've never really thought of seeking out a place for it, nor is it something I would usually order. What a fool I've been.   Figured it would an unidentifiable white fish with an overbearing batter to cover up the low quality product... fortunately, I was wrong.  I ordered the 2 piece spicy catfish which comes w a few shrimp and fries.   It took about 10 minutes to get my food which was a good sign since it was obviously going to be fresh. The portion was huge and looked great when I picked it up.   2 really big fish filets w a golden brown crust. When I bit into a piece it was piping hot and the flavor of the fish jumped out. It was really good. The spicy crunch on the outside was awesome and just the right amount. Not too much breading but enough to crisp it up.   Fries were cold as they had been waiting for the fish (thus only 4 stars) and the butterflied fried shrimp with it were great too.   It's a dive for sure and a bit seedy inside (these 2 me are positive traits) and will be back for sure.   There was another guy there who said he has been eating at Papa Joe's every Friday for a year....I asked what else he has had and he looked at me like I was crazy. Said, \"I've had the catfish and there is no reason to eat anything else ever\"   I can't say that I disagree with him. Go and don't be sneaky...order the catfish and enjoy.",

The spicy version is harmless. The beautiful 8\" filet is covered in a crispy seasoned fish fry crust disguising the white tender juicy and flakey catfish. It had the qualities of freshly caught seafood. Without prior knowledge of jalapeno hushpuppies, they came as a fantastic discovery!   The 5\" cod had the same great seasonings but couldn't compete with the catfish in that juicy fresh taste. The oil used tasted clean and new. The cornbread was simple as cornbread could be. The quality butterfly shrimp is a great accompaniment. If you give the lemonade a chance, you may detect the cozy hint of honey. I will visit again.",

    "text": "This place is amazing!  I decided to try it one day because it is right by my work, and I have been hooked ever since!  Some of the best soul food around this side of town!  Personal favs: spicy catfish (which by the way you can now get in nugget style!), mac-n-cheese, and their beans (which are a combo between ranch style beans and sweet beans; I can't even begin to describe the mouth watering flavor).  I always ask for my catfish extra spicy because their regular spicy batter doesn't cut it for me; they never object!  Food is consistently ranked for HIGH QUALITY.",

Good idea. for just over $10 I got the burger combo and he got a cheeseburger. We could tell that the burgers were made fresh to order not frozen and thrown on a grill or re-heated. It was a nice big burger, and was delicious with lettuce, tomato, and would be onion except that he's allergic. And pickles. Ketchup and mustard plus they had bottles of ketchup that you could add if you so desired. My combo came with two sides and a drink, which they had a soda fountain as well as a lemonade fruit punch and grape kool-aid option. I chose potato salad and sweet potato tater-tots. the potato salad was in a separate bowl and was good. The sweet potato tater tots on the other and blew me away. they were simply amazing. there was a lot of them as well. Totally worth the $10. Prolly be back more often.",

I can be sure when I leave Papa Joe's I am full and Happy. The Owner and his wife make you feel like family.  You can't get better than that. At least the part of the family they still like......",

I don't like spicy anything but I have to say that I also thought this was the best catfish I've had. So much so that I had to go back and make sure I didn't think it was so good only because I was hungry. It was just as good the second time. This time I decided to try some of the sides. The mac and cheese was just okay, I've had better. The greens were just too bitter for me. I couldn't finish them. But I will definitely be back for catfish and try the BBQ next time.

They are just down to earth folks and their food was delicious. My wife had spicy cod, my children had the hamburger and french fries and I had the spicy catfish. Everyone was delighted.

I have been frequenting Papa Joe's for over a year now and since moving to Phoenix in 2012. In that time, I have never had a bad meal, either quality or service wise...and only awesome experiences talking with Papa Joe, his lovely wife, and all of the customers who, like me, value awesome soul food and atmosphere alike. I am always assured of a smiling face, and someone (in Papa Joe) who values and appreciates me for more than just being a paying customer. Also, and this speaks more to Papa Joe as a person than a business owner/operator, this is the only place around where one can count on a heapin' helpin' of spiritual wisdom and comfort on top of their fish and chips or ribs.   My staple meal is the 2 or 3 piece cod with french fries and cole slaw. Of course, the meal also comes with a drink and butterflied fried shrimp too. The portions are hearty and filling, and the food is always fresh and tasty. The oil they use to fry in is changed regularly, and results in fish and chips that are light and clean, and the fries especially are always fried to perfection. They also have a non-carbonated drink station now, including lemonade, grape and fruit punch drinks, which reminds me of the South and the original soul food movement in so many ways that my mouth waters and heart aches that I am not writing this from there with a cold drink in my hand! My favorite is taking the lemonade and grape drink in the cup together, and the entire meal compliments itself and my palate so wonderfully.   I have also had the ribs, and other menu items, and love them all, but return for the fish and chips almost weekly or at least when my wallet can afford it. But more than anything else, I return to support Papa Joe, his family and business--because they all treat me and make me feel like one of their own time and again, without reserve or fail.   I am not going to slight or judge any Yelpers who have left negative reviews of either the atmosphere or quality of food Papa Joe's serves... to each their own and everyone is entitled to their opinions, just as am I. However and as someone who has lived in and traveled to so many different states and countries outside of America even, and has sampled the cuisine in so many locales that I cannot even count--I believe Papa Joe's Fish and Que to be a cut above the rest when one is seeking the physical and spiritual comfort and satiation of a True soul food experience in the heart of the Valley of the Sun.   My hope is that you will try them and feel the same... and become a member of the family with your first and every visit thereafter:-).",

I ordered the 1 piece cod w/sweet potato tater toys (combo incl. 2 fried shrimp) and I added a piece of spicy catfish.  Everything was seasoned well, good size portions, lightly breaded, Not Greasy and cooked perfectly.  They also serve BBQ meats, but I did not try that this time.  It's located in a strip mall next to the bowling alley.  Parking is limited, depending on the time of day you come.  The place is a small mom & pop place with about 8 tables.

I called back to let him know I was taking it back, his answer yeah it would be an honor if you did. I get there he inspects it and said it was good. He has a chef, they have timers and refuse to let me get another order because he said it would be the same, and made a comment must be the heat. My response was so your saying I'm complaining just to complain. He gave me my money back. I gave him one star because his customer service is lacking. I will no longer tell people to go there. For someone who he thinks is complaining just to complain he should know,  this is my first complaint on Yelp. I never had a reason to complain on this app. Before, but he gave me two reason, the food and his attitude.",

The pulled brisket was good but, I have had softer pulled brisket before. I was disappointed at the jalapeno hush puppies. I could not taste the jalapeno so it was more corn bread than jalapeno. The coleslaw was good. Sorry people for the short review but, maybe next time I should go for the fish menu instead. My take is to give it three stars because it is a place that you need to try other menu items.",

I won't ask why bc I'm not gonna argue that, who would? The castfish was fried to perfection, perfect spice, Mac and cheese was thick n creamy, corn bread was FYE. Service was great too, they make you feel comfy. I will def be coming back, probably too often. Next time I'm trying the beef ribs, to be continued",

    "text": "I finally had an opportunity to try out this place after hearing more than a few people bring it up, so for lunch today my family and I decided to check it out.  THIS is not the \"dine in\" spot. This is a \"get your food and eat it at a stoplight\" place. Seating is limited, and it is hot as the fish grease in there. My guess is that the place has a swamp cooler, which is no match for 96 degrees and 40% humidity and a 66degree dew point... Call ahead and take your time getting there. Our order took 45 minutes to get to the table.  Service was good, and the staff was courteous. No complaints there, so let's get down to the real reason we came... The food... I've read the reviews of others and wonder how many of the people giving 5 stars actually know how to cook. If you know your way around the kitchen and your pallet is set to good food and good quality, you won't like this place at all. The food picture on the website is NOT the food that came out of that kitchen today...  In fact, keep driving past this place and find yourself a Mandy's or a Pete's and you'll fair a whole lot better. My wife got the three piece catfish, which came with three shrimp. She choose the baked beans potato salad as a side. One shrimp in and she passed it to me. Not only was it some pre-breaded shrimp (which most places serve) but it was a low quality (like not restaurant grade) and tasted as if it was thawed and re-frozen or poorly stored. Terrible. The fish also appeared to be some pre-breaded frozen variety that was a half-step below Gorton's Fish Sticks.  I got the hot link sandwich because four ribs for $16.42 was pretty steep tome seeing as how Famous Dave's has four bones for $14.99 that comes with two sides and a cornbread.  When I drove around the back of the building there was no grill and no smoke coming out of anywhere, and I wasn't paying for any one's boiled/oven browned ribs. The hotlink was hot and flavorful but they're small and they're cut down the center like your grandma used to do weenies when you were 7, and crisscrossed on a hamburger bun. Tip: Get a bigger hotlink, keep the bun. People will eat it with plain white bread if it's right.  Fries were lackluster, just plan shoestrings. They could sprinkle a little Cajun spice (on them to give them a little more flair. The person who go it the worst was my daughter. She ordered a pulled pork sandwich that consisted of a scoop of dry pork with a dollop of bbq sauce in the middle of it. Needless to say, that went straight in the trash...  I still don't understand what took 45 minutes... Maybe they only have one microwave...",

I consider Papa Joe's Fish-N-Que to be a fail attempt at Soul Food. I had the Catfish, Potato Salad, and Corn Bread. I prefer my catfish to be fresh as well as my shrimp. I also prefer my fish to be fried in corn meal. My fish tasted like it was straight from the freezer and just put in flour and dumped in the deep fryer. Not seasoned at all. The shrimp that came with the fish was absolutely disgusting it tasted like batter and grease. They didn't even bother to put any type of seasoning on it. The potato salad tasted like pickled potatoes. It was super sour. I don't know how you mess up cornbread but they managed to do so. The cornbread tasted like stale batter. It's obvious that they were cutting corners so I can't wrap my head around why it took 30 minutes to get my food. I'm giving this 2 stars because the people were nice and the place was clean. Other than that, Subpar at most. I don't recommend this to anyone who loves soul food and know how it's suppose to taste.",

Mac and cheese was yummy gooey and creamy. I could see the real cheddar in there!  Second trip I tried the brisket sandwich, fried okra, and cornbread. Very generous pile of tender brisket was great, but I am not a huge fan of the vinegary bbq sauce. Just a personal preference, but I prefer it sweeter. Fans of the sassy vinegar bbq will probably love it. I love that the fried okra was a bit spicy; nice touch. Next time I will request it extra crispy. The bits that were a bit burned tasted heavenly. Cornbread was perfectly sweet, fluffy, moist and corny.  Washed down with their delicious lemonade. I will definitely be back to sample other menu items. I love that its a mom and pop as I like to support local businesses especially when they go out of their way to make you feel welcome!",

He appeared to be chewing something in his mouth and had that cliche southern style look. I loved it, we ordered the catfish and cod with fried shrimp on side. I must say they were delicious. Good service with good food always speaks volumes in my book.  I'm not sure if the fried fish cooked by African American people was so good because they're great cold or because I'm biased because it's Black history month. Never the less, two thumbs up.",

I had the 2 piece spicy catfish and shrimp; the portions are generous, the catfish is wonderful -- he uses a real light breading on the catfish and a thicker, crunchier breading on the shrimp.  I like the that the catfish was reasonably mild in flavor, although he has an option for spicy breading.   Standard fare includes fries, although I opted for the jalapeno hush puppies, which did not disappoint.

    "text": "Wanted to try southern food this week so I decided to make my way to Papa Joe's Fish N Que. Upon entering I noticed that the design of the restaurant was pretty neat. I had trouble finding out where the menu was at first, found it was posted near the door, which I thought was an odd choice. Finally settled with something simple. Catfish with fries and fried shrimp, spicy. Placed my order...waited...waited...waited. For only one other group of people it took about 20 minutes to finally get my food. For somewhere with an emphasis on lunch hours, it sure took awhile. Sat down and started on my meal. Catfish was buried under all my fries so I felt compelled to eat most of the fries first. Personally, I found them bland. It's possible that other people prefer fries this way, but I just found it tasteless. Went for the fried shrimp. Pretty good especially dipped in the cocktail sauce. Lastly, had the catfish which was good. Was juicy and cooked well. Fell apart on my fork which increased the difficulty in eating. Also, I noticed nothing spicy about the catfish. Bummer. I love seafood but I've had better, way better, but I'm guessing for the price it makes sense.   All in all it was...ok. I was really underwhelmed especially after reading all the rave reviews. Of course I'm basing this off one item on menu but that's the experience I had. I just feel there is nothing at this particular place that is unique or above and beyond anywhere else with similar food and style. Not bad, but I probably wouldn't come back.",

That being said, Papa Joe's is delicious. We have never had a bad experience and have been coming here for a while. The pulled pork or pulled chicken are my personal favorites. If you go later in the day there is a good chance the pulled pork will be gone, that's a good sign in my book. He normally gets the ribs & has never complained. Their fried okra is good as well the batter has the perfect spices in it.  I have suggested Papa Joe's to several friends; its small & the people are friendly!",

Placed the order over the phone for pick up, greeted with a very warming and welcoming gentleman. Brought food home, and it was amazing. The fried catfish is lightly breaded perfectly, paired with shrimp and mac n cheese, I ordered the largest combo thinking I'd have some later for dinner. However, once I started, I couldn't stop til it was completely devoured. This place is definitely going to receive regular patronage from me if this catfish kick ends up ever going away xD",

Main choices are BBQ or Fried Fish. There are many options and sides. Opted for the pulled brisket combination with jalopeno hush puppies and cole slaw with a fountain drink.  The pulled brisket was very good, served on a hambuger bun. You can add their BBQ sauce or hot sauce and again there are options. The brisket was flavorful and juicy and a very generous portion. I would order that again any day. BBQ sauce that we tried had a vinegar base   Not too impresed with the jalopeno hush puppes. Small size nuggets but not spicy for my taste. Searched but could not find the jalopeno. The cole slaw was good, it had a mayo base.   Will be back to try the fried catfish with greens and okra. You can call in your order and take it home or dine in. A filling and flavorful lunch.",

Kind of an eclectic menu with a few fried fish choices and some BBQ options. I got a turkey burger and it was just okay. It was not great nor was it bad. Three stars for good. It had mustard on it which kind of ruined it for me. It had a lot of mustard on it as in they poured the whole jar on it. yuk! I do not like mustard on burgers at all and it seemed odd on a Turkey Burger. But I have to admit I can not remember if the menu mentioned that and I could have brought it back if I wanted to. However, I scarfed it down since I had not eaten all day and our movie was starting soon. Soooooo, I take that as a \"my fault\" type of hit. Well, except they should probably not put that much on it. Next time I will try another dish.   I did taste some other foods. The Jalapeno Hush puppies are good but again not five stars or anything.  The sweet potato pie is also tasty. Again three star for a good place to go.   I am still not sure about the five star reviews here. I am not staying it is bad place at all. It is a solid place to go if you want a fried platter. It is just not a five star place. There are way better BBQ otions and fish in town. Also, The staff could be a bit friendlier. They were kind of rude.",

This evening, after a 475 mile drive from Santa Fe, we tried PaPa Joe's.   PaPa Joe's is on a major East/West street not too far northwest of the central downtown area...about a 10 minute drive from 3rd and Thomas in moderate traffic.  The restaurant is in a small strip center that is loaded with active small businesses. The neighborhood is busy light commercial. Parking could have been a challenge but not this time, I pulled into the lot and had a spot immediately right at the restaurant entrance. Easy access.  The place is friendly, easy going, clean and neat. The menu is on the wall and includes a large variety of BBQ meats, fish and shrimp as well as a good selection of side dishes. It's order at the register, serve yourself when your number is called and bus it afterwards. The menu is also available on line and includes items not mentioned here...we were after BBQ and catfish. Comfortable setting.  With the idea of sharing our meals, she ordered a three rib combo with two sides while I had a two piece catfish combo with three shrimp and a side. My side was fried okra and hers were greens and sweet potatoes...There was plenty of food. We each had iced tea to drink. Less than five minutes after ordering, our food was out of the kitchen. It was presented in styro carry out boxes. The catfish was almost too hot to eat, crispy on the outside, moist and steamy on the inside. The fried okra was pretty typical of commercial fried okra and was tasty and hot. Her ribs were Kansas City style, quite large and meaty, tender and well cooked, the greens were home style, hot, tender and tasty...soft but not overcooked. The sweet potatoes were like Tater Tots, but as the rest, hot, tasty and cooked just right. Joe's BBQ sauce is a good combo of sweet and spicy unlike many that are poorly balanced and detract from the meat by overpowering it. There was plenty of sauce with the ribs but not too much. Good food, good portions.  While we were waiting for our food, I struck up a conversation with a fellow watching football on the wall mounted TV. It was PaPa Joe. He's a personable fellow but after a brief chat, had to get back to the kitchen...I wanted to talk some more but they were busy with the Saturday evening procession of carry out and eat in diners. Friendly.  $19.80 out the door...I did leave a tip in addition. In my opinion, a bargain given the good food, friendly atmosphere and fast service. I would go back and I would recommend it to a friend.",

The two young African American sitting next to me, were saying unbelievable racist rants about white people , not to themselves but very loud so I could hear it. The whole place heard it. No management intervened. Made me very uncomfortable and I will not go back.",

Having said that, I don't feel that I can give as extensive of a review as I normally would. I got the pulled brisket sandwich, sweet potato tater tots, and jalapeno hushpuppies and everything I put in my mouth was delicious! The atmosphere wasn't that great, but I don't really go to restaurants for the atmosphere (and besides, I got my order to go anyway). I definitely plan on going back as soon as I can (I'm a poor grad student with very little free time) and I plan on ordering something else off of their wonderful-looking menu!",

I also tried a bite of the pulled pork which I thought was passable (the vinegar based bbq sauce was, however, marvelous) but not anywhere in the same league as the catfish.",

The fries I didn't care for unfortunately and I couldn't tell that my order was the spicy version. I would have preferred the fish to have some kind of kick to it.   I definitely want to come back though and order other items off the menu. Wish it was in a different area since parking is limited.   This might be my new favorite spot in the area. Everyone working there was very nice and you get a very homely feeling when you walk in.  If they made changes to the fries and the spicy issue it would be closer to a five star rating. Restaurants with great fried fish are hard to find out in Arizona so I'm glad I was able to find this spot.",

Ten minutes later my rib arrived without my fish. The rib was 1/2 cold and 1/2 hot, definately microwaved. The rib wss tough as leather and dificult to get off the bone. Another 10 minutes passed and I asked about the fish. They finally located it and in 10 minutes it arrived. The small filets were only partially breaded and were mushy. Rather than the fresh fis I expected, they brought back my childhood nightmares of frozen fish sticks. The shrimp were boxed frozen and tastless. The saving grace was the fried okra was ok and the elderly order taker did offer a free desert for the long wait. I declined as I just wanted out of there.",

    "text": "MY TIP: \"We ordered the spicy catfish and the regular whiting...OMG the whiting!!!\"  Found this place on Yelp, surprised we hadn't seen it earlier, and wanted something different. We felt like having seafood but really don't like the overpriced chain seafood restaurants (Red Lobster, Pappadeaux's) that are never as good as they show or charge.   Anyway, found this place and it had great reviews - must be good. And yeah, not disappointed. We usually order directly from Yelp photos, so we really already knew what we wanted but were surprised at how much was on the menu.   One Catfish combo  (Joe recommend spicy) and a Whiting combo (regular batter). We got various sides to share and try. I would have to say, I wasn't impressed by the sides, but they were good. Just your good ol' average comfort-food sides, but the real star was the battered fish. I love catfish - so I always order it, but I wasn't as in love this time. It was good, didn't have as much flavor for me, so maybe I will try the regular batter next time. But the whiting - I would order that again. I don't know if it was the batter or what, tasted almost like lemon pepper, that was delish! Portions were plenty - I was kind of happy my boyfriend couldn't eat all of his and I finished his Whiting (oink oink).   Overall we enjoyed our meal and we will definitely be back. The restaurant was comfortable, overall pretty clean, wasn't too crowded, there was a TV with Family Feud playing so we were all guessing along, and service was decent.   That's what I have to say about it.",

Now on to the hot link sammich for once I had a hot link sandwich that has heat to it clearly cooked not reheated.

I'm originally from California Bay Area to be exact so we're super multicultural and we have so many soulfood and down south comfort food restaurants it's crazy! But since I moved to Arizona 9 months ago I hadn't found one the suited my tastebuds yet! Until last week it was almost 8 o clock I was craving and hungry I was yelping restaurants and PaPas was the only one that was still open. The nice gentleman took my order over the phone I drove about 7 minutes away and picked up my hot link combo with Mac and cheese, potato salad, baked beans, collard greens, and peach cobbler. I was highly satisfied and slept like a baby afterwards. The hot link was good ooh wee was it spicy one of the HOTTEST.... Hot links I have EVER had since Louisiana where my family's from. The Macaroni was A1 I am like guru of Macaroni and cheese so it says a lot, the collard greens were tender and seasoned to perfection, potato salad was good, and I could taste bbq sauce in the baked beans. I'm going back really soon... my new spot!",

No weird old fish taste. Food was piping hot. Also, they were relatively quick with putting out our order. They were very polite and the cost was VERY inexpensive!  Cons: the smallest combo came with 1piece of fish 2 shrimp, side and drink. While its nice all are included in the city combo the two little shrimp includes were well...funny to me.

    "text": "So after trying probably the worst \"so-called soul food\" restaurant, we didn't want to waste anymore of our time. We've been in Phoenix for a year & a half. Nothing. That changed when we went to Papa Joes. Our friends suggested that we go & we trust their judgment. So here we go.   We went in & ordered our food, sat down & waited for our number \"72\" to be called. Food took a little longer than anticipated but we waited. Then I heard 74, 75, 76, 77. At this point we're like wait, what's going on? The owner looked over at us and asked us what number we were & we told him. He asked the cook & apparently he forgot. Of course that was very upsetting. My husband now wanted to leave. But nonetheless,  the owner was concerned & apologized. They got our food together and it came right up.   He ordered the wing dinner with Mac & cheese & peach cobbler with Pink lemonade.  I had the half & half spicy & mild catfish nuggets & a sweet potato pie & grape Kool aid.  Our meals, delicious. My catfish nuggets, more than amazing. Oh & the price for it all, no more than $25. We had just spent $55 for a little less food at Off Da Hook Soul Food & had the worst service & food. I didn't expect the catfish nuggets to be so big and it was a 12 piece.     We want to go back today. Definitely getting the same thing. This time I'm going with greens. The mac was good but wasn't our favorite. So the wait was definitely worth it and the food, amazingly good. Best catfish we've ever had, hands down. 5 stars is a must.",

I wasn't a fan of the peach cobbler, I wonder if they used canned peaches bc something didn't taste right, can't pin point what. Sweet potato pie was good though!   Owner is friendly, lot of locals seem to frequent this place and it looks like he is on a first name basis with them; always a good sign.  Can't wait to return and try more items off their menu!",

I won't lie, being a Soul Food spot, I wanted to see if there were any reviews from Black people who said it was good...a legitimate metric! The reviews did not lie.   Customer service was great. The owner came from behind the counter to explain the menu on the wall to  newbies who lingered. Your food is cooked fresh, so expect to wait 15 minutes or so for your order. The restaurant has seating for about 20 customers, and a couple of tables on a small patio. Very unpretentious, but clean. It's all about the food.   I ordered the one piece spicy catfish combo, which came with two pieces of shrimp,two sides and a drink for six bucks. Really??? And it was plenty.   The fish was well-seasoned, piping hot and not greasy. The collard greens were good. Not bland, but not as flavorful as my taste buds prefer. Nothing a packet of hot sauce can't solve. But they won at having a smoky flavor without being greasy. The jalapeno hush puppies? Pure perfection! I added the peach cobbler, which was wonderful. I like lots of crust, and it delivered.   In a nutshell, I will drive out of my way to come back. It's worth the drive.",

Turns out that most of Papa Joe's family are from Texas and they brought back those great tasting flavors to AZ. Nice!  Love their simple menu of tasty treats. Catfish, Cod, and Whiting are all available in both regular or spicy. They have Shrimp, Hot Wings, Chicken Strips, BBQ Brisket, BBQ Pork, Ribs, Hot Links as well as Burgers and then some. The choices of sides are also a bonus and include items like Collard Greens, fried Okra, Potato Salad, Cole Slaw, Jalapeno Hush Puppies, Mac & Cheese, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Tater Tots, Beans ... too many to list them all.  Normally get the 3 pc Spicy Catfish with 4 Shrimp and a side of whatever with a giant Grape Drink. Boy that brings back the memories. My wife usually gets the Cod and Shrimp Basket with a side. I have not tried the BBQ yet but definitely have it on my radar for next time.  Papa Joe and his crew are extremely friendly and most helpful. Everything is very good and you can tell they put a lot of Love and Soul into their food. Don't forget a little Granny Ann's Sweet Potato Pie, Peach Cobbler, Cheese Cake, or Pecan Pie to finish off your meal.  Give Papa Joe a shout out and you will be pleased. Located in a small strip shop on the south side of Bethany and not in the hospital across street like the Yelp map suggest. TOUCHDOWN!  5 STARS",

For those that complain about the decor, this is a fish shack, if you want to pay double to eat in a better decorated and more modern establishment then by all mean venture onto Centeral. If you want good fish at a good price then this is your place.  I had the 1pc Cod (Spicy)/2Shrimp w/ Mac & Cheese Im not sure if the batter was the spicy part of the sauce, but the batter was not spicy to me. However, all the fish was battered nicely (not full of grease) and the tarter and cocktail sauce was very good and had a bit of a kick. To cure my spice crave I got some hot sauce by the pop machine and that did the trick. The Mac & Cheese was a bit bland, but everything was piping hot!  All the staff was fantastically friendly and very helpful.  Its not a bad place if you need a F&C fix.",

Ordered the 2 piece catfish with shrimp for my wife, 3 piece ribs for myself and a 2 piece ribs for my kids. The catfish was perfectly seasoned. I'm normally skeptical about ordering ribs anywhere I go due to the lack of meat on the bones. Wasn't disappointed there. And they were cooked to perfection. Very juicy and the meat came off the bone with ease. Portions weren't bad as well. I could've eaten more but I'm a big dude at 6'9\".   The sides we chose were cornbread, greens, potato salad and Mac n cheese. I went on a limb and tried the greens n Mac n cheese because I heard they were good but...I like mine better lol.   Definitely a place I'll revisit again but for different sides.  Enjoy!!",

    "text": "I had a hankering for some fried and thought I'd give this place a try based on many of the positive reviews from my fellow Yelp community.   After trying it, I have to say there isn't one ounce of regret in doing so....read on.  Location & Aesthetics - Located in in Phoenix on Bethany Road opposite the Phoenix Baptist Hospital. The restaurant isn't difficult to miss with their large sign but the street can be busy with traffic behind you so it's not easy to slow down and you can miss it if you don't know where it is.  Thankfully my trusty phone GPS pinpointed the exact spot. Parking can be somewhat difficult as the parking spots are limited and whatever are available are shared with other businesses.   There is a small street parallel to Bethany Road that must be used to access the restaurant and some of the other businesses and I believe one can park there as I saw a customer parking there but don't quote me on this.   The restaurant itself is a bit dimly lit but there are large windows in front that provide light.  The restaurant is a bit old too and could probably use a sprucing up in redecoration as some of the ceiling tiles had prior leak spots/stains.  The restaurant itself, most importantly, was very clean.    Menu - Clearly visible but not above or behind the cashier/order/checkout area but rather to the left on the wall.  Clear and concise.     Service - The staff was spectacularly nice, friendly, warm and welcoming.  Any questions were answered promptly.      Food - I had the whiting and my wife had the catfish.  Mind you, I have never had or tasted these two particular types of fish.  The side I had with mine was the fried okra (yet another item I've never had) and my wife had the coleslaw. The fish was well fried with not too much batter and very well seasoned.  It was soft and tender and didn't have any briny taste to it.  This opinion applied to both the whiting and the catfish. The fried okra was the perfect combination of batter and okra.  I was able to easily break it apart and see the okra which was well cooked and none of the slimy was evident from the okra itself. Another thing to note is the 2-piece plate does come with 3 pieces of shrimp (fried) which was very tasty and delicious, and a drink.    Despite never had whiting and catfish in my life, I have to say that I'm now hooked on it and since I left, I've been craving on returning to this restaurant to have more!",
