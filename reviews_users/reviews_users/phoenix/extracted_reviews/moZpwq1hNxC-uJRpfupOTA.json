The Carne Adovada Plate was always so tasty but the last several times I ordered it was dry and tough or else loaded with fat and quit greasy.  The Chicken Quesada used to be the BEST in town but no there isn't in cheese inside the Quesada.  I don't know if there's new management or that they just don't care about quality any longer.  It's sad to lose one your go to places but I won't be coming back.",

My favorite dish is the Red River Chicken. It has a kick to it and is topped with the most amazing Cilantro Pesto, yum! All of their salads & sandwiches are great and the Green Chile Mashed Potatoes are delish. My only complaint is that the Red River Chicken isn't offered on the dinner menu, really wish they would change that!  The restaurant has a nice outdoor eating area as well as cozy booths in the bar.   With all the traditional Mexican food in the area, it's nice to have some variety and New Mexican style at Carlsbad Tavern.",

The patio is great on a hot night- the sound of waterfalls make you feel like you are in a Mexican hacienda.  The cocktails were a bit pricey- 10$ each, but really tasty.  We had the special of the day which was 3 tostadas for 10 bucks- WOW- each of the three offered were so good!  The house specialty- pork adovada was my favorite.  The chile rellenos were excellent and the chimichanga came with a large side of rice and beans.  Excellent service- and a shout out to my friend TONY from NAPERVILLE, IL.",

The last time I went I sat in the bar area expecting to get faster service, but it was the exact opposite. They kept forgetting about our drinks, it took over 20 minutes to get our food, no refills, didn't ask if I wanted another beer, and then we couldn't even find our waiter when we were done to get our tab which ended up taking 15 minutes. The food wasn't great & it was kind of cold. If I hadn't of waited so long I would have sent it back. It was obvious that are disappearing waiter forgot about our food & it probably sat there getting cold.  The location is still great for me, so I'll probably try it again like an idiot. Who knows maybe I'll have a better experience next time, but for now I feel that 2 stars is being generous.",

By far the best thing was the chicken enchiladas.  It had good flavor, the meat was moist and seasoned.  Yum..  The pork stuff chile was decent too though a bit on the bland side.  I asked for pico de gallo which helped it a bit.  The carne acevedo(?) burrito wasn't bad, but even more on the bland side.  The sopapilla that came with the platter was pretty good, I didn't even put honey on it.  The worst thing about the plate was all the cheese.  I'm a fan of molty cheese, but this was just way too much.  There had to be like half a block on the plate.  We also tried the green chile pork stew which was decent..  The chile had a pretty big kick.  Somehow the dish didn't come together well.  Just tasted like veggie soup with green chile salsa in it.  The worst thing was the pork that was overcooked and dry in it.    The pricing is a bit high, even for happy hour.  The atmosphere and menus are creative.  The service was pretty good when we went, but we were there early for lunch (~11am).  Decent place, maybe I'll try the nachos next time.",

Perhaps it was an off day, but the food and the service were quite poor. We went in for lunch on a Friday, and I had chicken quesadillas because I wasn't too hungry. My date ordered a green chili burrito. The only thing that saves this from being a one star in my mind was that the green chili was really tasty on the burrito.

    "text": "I'm wavering between 2 and 3 stars. Good thing I had a dang good sandwich...  So, this place is kind of funny. I live right down the street and had no idea it existed--It's kind of tucked back in a parking lot. The gigantic fake waterfall outside the front entrance makes you feel like you're about to stand in line for one of those water rides where you're thrown around in a log boat at an amusement park. There are bats decorating the whole place. It's just funky.  We were greeted by the bartender, who sat the 5 of us (me, parents, grandparents) and promptly walked away. It became very clear to me that the one lone server was in over his head (although I only saw 2 tables outside by the waterfall and one other table besides us) while we waited AND WAITED to be greeted. Bartender had no one to tend bar for. She couldn't have at least helped the dude out and taken our drink orders? Server was slightly spastic but nice enough. It took a while to get our drinks and then even MORE of a while to place our order. He was running in and outside like a crazy person. To his credit our order came out correctly.  The menu is semi-hilarious. It's inside a fake newspaper and boasts all kinds of tex-mex/grill/general meat-loving delicacies. Being a vegetarian, I was all \"buh\" but thought the \"Portales Portabella\" sounded delicious.   ...AND IT WAS. At huge sandwich of a basamic-marinated portabella on fresh focaccia with different roasted peppers, red onion, pepperjack and avocado. Hot diggity (what?) it was good. I could barely eat half and savored the leftovers for the next meal. It was served with a huge portion of seasoned fries.   My grandma tried the green chili mac and a side order portion was pretty huge. It was tasty--pepperjack and cheddar cheese, corn, chiles...all served in a tortilla-covered bowl. Have you heard my new rap song, carbsoncarbsoncarbs?  In all, it was an OK lunch. Again, I was pretty appalled by the lack of help the one server got from the bartender and manager who seemingly had not much to do. Maybe I'm just sensitive to my fellow service industry family?",

So we found somewhere (thanks, Yelpers) that seemed to have a pretty solid selection of Mexican food. And that's what we found.  The food is in no way mind-blowing, but it's different enough that you don't find everything on the menu at a standard chain Mexican place. Our drinks were tasty, and they have a pretty wide selection of cocktails and beer to keep the crowd happy.   The ambiance is nice - even though it was pretty crowded, we were seated fairly quickly on the patio, and we didn't have to shout to have a conversation. Our service, though, was pretty mediocre, and we had to flag down our waiter several times because he would not regularly check on us.   Overall, if we're back in Scottsdale next year, I'll probably venture somewhere new.",

It was busy and bustling so I expected a possible stellar dining experience, I mean with a full house on a Thursday evening, it's gotta be good.  It happened to be 114 outside which might explain why all three of my beers were cool... not cold. I had the snapper tacos. Fish in Arizona is always sort of a gamble, but I have had better tacos made from fish sticks. The spice was interesting but not compelling. I didn't get to choose my tortilla preference, that's okay... but the overall dish was strangely out of place and lacking any sort of excitement or originality.  Service was good, friendly and attentive. So this in no way is a negative for the staff... unless you are the head chef.",

The first time I went for breakfast and the food was great, parking was easy to find and our server was incredibly friendly, however, this was not the case the second time I went. The second time, I had to use the valet parking as their lot is pretty small, as mentioned by others.  The service was horrible and the waiter was incredibly rude.  Even though the food was great that time, the server had a way of ruining the experience for us and it makes me think twice about going back.  Upon leaving I had to wait 10 minutes for the valet guy to bring my car around as he was out of sight and no one seemed to know where he was.",

    "text": "Eh I have experienced better, but I felt the 2 star mark was a bit harsh. I wasn't really disappointed in anything in our experience, I think my issue mostly was the fire burning in my chest for an hour after dinner. Their food is spicy!  We were seated in the bar area, perfect because the Sunday night football game was on and we had a perfect seat to watch. We started off with a couple of bears and their crap cake appetizer. I enjoyed the crap, boyfriend thought it was bland, but he is from Michigan and has very high standards for crab, so we will ignore him. It came with a nice tossed salad and an extremely hot dipping sauce. If you like that sort of thing, awesome, if not you should stay away from the sauce.   For dinner he got the roasted chicken with mac 'n' cheese, chicken was tasty and the mac 'n' cheese was to die for! I got the stacked enchiladas, subed green sauce for the red though, again their shit is spicy! The flavors of the meat were fantastic, however there is a lot going on with this place. I could only eat maybe a quarter of it. I would recomend both.   They also have this burger on the menu that is pretty much 100% made out of hobenerros; mixed into the patty, on top of the patty and in a sauce on the burger. They even have a disclaimer on the menu stating \"You order it, you own is.\" So not take backs. I witnessed a friend try to eat this once, it was so hot he just got made about it. Spitefully ate the whole thing those, I am pretty sure it gave him an ulcer or two.   Over all good place, but I wouldn't venture back unless it was very convenient to my location and I was in the mood for some heart burn and breathing fire.",

But then you figure when they're crammed to the gills (which is generally how it goes), you can't always expect Speedy freaking Gonzales to be your server. However, last night I don't think I could have sneezed between the time I ordered my food and when it arrived to my table. Excellent.. is all I can say about this joint.  If you're looking for some tasty New Mexican fare, get over there!! And if it's packed, let the valet park your car(CUZ ITS FREE)! Start off with a Dos Equis Amber, get some nachos(this vegetarian WILL eat the niblets of chicken in them nachos cuz it's just that tasty) and kick back. Preferably on the patio...because there's a waterfall!!!   And if Jacob's working the bar.. expect nothing but the best in cocktails... seriously.",

We especially enjoy the bar area after a hot day of golf, although the patio is fun if weather permits.  It is a casual place, which suits us just fine.  My favorite dishes are the stacked enchiladas and the Osso Bucco, although I also enjoy their appetizers: quesadillas (filet or chicken) and the crab cakes.  Their dishes have a nice spicy/smoky flavor, spicier than traditional regular Mexican food.  It's an affordable and friendly place and the food is consistently good.",

Some of the pieces were so tough I couldn't chew through them. The salsas had very little flavor as well.   There was only one other table occupied when we were there, and although we received our food quickly, it took a while after we were seated until our waitress arrived to take our order.

They came out on a BURNING HOT plate, hotter than necessary and unsafe.  I scolded myself just nudging the plate over.  Food was good but goodness it was spicy.    Service:  Waitress was a \"no BS\" kinda lady and I respect that!  She was in and out, checked on us, and let us enjoy our meal!    Atmosphere:  Unfortunately, this is where the review falls short.  Although the decor is funky and dark, and the outside is gorgeous, we were disturbed many times by a completely drunken patron.  He came to our table several times, belching loudly and disgustingly as we ate.  One waitress came over and physically pulled him up from our booth one time.  He nearly sat on my to go box when he flopped down.  That really ruined the night for us.  We were actually worried to talk to the parking lot out of concern for seeing him.  The management really needs to watch the over serving and call a cab for a customer like that.",

The food is spicy and very unique. I've also tried the jalapeno marg and loved it- it has a great kick! The only reason I'm giving this place a four star is because they need to bring taco Tuesday back and have a better happy hour menu!",

    "text": "Meh...Blah...Robin, don't ever take me to the bat cave again!  This was the worst New Mexican food and margaritas we ever had! I never have to force myself to drink anything with tequila in it, but their house margarita just didn't taste right. We got chips and salsa, which you have to pay for, and was told which salsa was mild and which was hot. They must have forgotten the chiles as neither was hot.   We then asked our waiter about some items on the menu and his response was \"it's popular\". We then asked what he would recommend and he said \"anything with sauce and cheese on it to cover it up\". Wow...we looked at each other thinking \"is the food so nasty that we need cheese and sauce to get through it?\" We decided to split the Blue Corn Enchiladas and the 1/2 Rotisserie Spicy Citrus Chicken. I don't know how to explain it but the enchiladas were tough and the green chile was tasteless. The chicken sounded like it should be spicy with habanero and guajillo chiles. It tasted more like it was smothered in BBQ sauce. It came with green chile mac n' cheese which was tasteless and the jicama slaw, well the jicama was okay but the cabbage was bitter and the dressing did not help it at all.   The only reason I gave it 1 star is for the cool atmosphere! Inside it's like a bat cave and the outside patio in nice weather looks relaxing.   Unless we hear some significant changes to the food and drink, I think we'll have to hang out with Superman instead!",

I came in at 11PM and I'm not sure if it was a bad time of day or what but when we walked in...nobody was there to greet us so we just sat in the bar area. Second bummer! This lady was super drunk yelling across the bar and obviously belligerent. The bartender didn't seem to care at all. This lady even spoke about how she was drinking and driving home. Say whattttt? Get a taxi!   Anyways, food was mediocre as well. Nachos were just chicken, cheese, and meat. No green onion, no tomato, no guac. Give me some colors on my nachos! Service was nothing stupendous either and they charged my friend $3 for a ramekin of a measly scoop of guac. That was our last straw. I will admit their margaritas were killer though. That may have been the reason for my extra star.  Los siento, Carlsbad Tavern!",

I was hoping for more heat and that great New Mexico chile flavor.  The carne adovada plate was also a bit on the boring side.  I have had carne adovada all over the place and this one didn't stand out.  When I think of New Mexican food I think green chiles, red chile, lots of spice and savoriness.    The patio was nice and the service met expectations for a busy place.  While it wasn't bad I really don't think I would come back as it is a bit far for me and was just okay.  I also can't say I would recommend it as for New Mexican food there are just better options around the valley.",

But we did recently go for Sunday brunch for the first time, and it was good!  I had eggs benedict with jalapeno hollandaise.  The eggs were properly poached and the hollandaise was spicy, but not too much so.  As a side note, whoever was in charge of those potatoes had an accident with the salt shaker.  Waaayyy too salty.  Oh, and most importantly, they have bloody mary's for $3.25.  Yes, $3.25.  Mimosas, too.  I know the current trend is bottomless, but I usually only order one or two anyway, or my whole day is shot because I'm stuck on the sofa in a drunken, overstuffed stupor.

Our favorites are the chips and two salsas, the new mexican potstickers, and the machaca red chile chimichunga. We've deviated from getting this exact thing once in awhile but keep going back to this combo. LOVE IT! I, personally, cannot say enough about the potstickers. It's the strangest combination and it shouldn't work, but it DOES! I crave them. I crave them NOW. I keep trying to remember to order them after my entree, as they would be a perfect compliment after the machaca which can sometimes be very spicy. But, the sopapillas are also a perfect meal ender after spiciness. We once had an issue with the salsa being bitter, but found that they forgot to add sugar when mixing it. The owner/manager was right on top of it and comped it - so no complaint there, in the end. Service is always exceptional. We always just show up, without a reservation and never have an issue getting a table - even when it looks to be packed. I love this place! Wish we would go more often but it really is something special and we want to keep it that way. You're bat crazy (HA!) if you don't visit this place at least once. And, get those potstickers!!!",

I chose a green chili burritto stuffed with carne adovado and it was spicy in the best way. It was a huge portion so I was able to take half home for later:) My boyfriend tried the Food Network acclaimed Habenero Burger, and seemed to love every bite.  The atmosphere is very relaxed and the decore makes you feel like you're really eating in a cave. We sat inside, but the outdoor patio was just as awesome with a running waterfall I'm sure helps cool you off in the summer heat.   Great menu, great beer selection and nice service. Highly recommended if you're up for some spice or a drink in a cool location, definatly not your typical \"Scottsdale\" bar.",

    "text": "I really like this place, but the prices are a little inflated. I used to come here a lot with my co-workers at lunch when I worked in the area, but not as often since I changed employers. I still want to come here because I love the habenero burger so, so much, but I'm a little iffy on spending $13 on a burger. I come occasionally when I'm not feeling cheap but I never have any regrets afterward. The drinks are also a little overpriced for how weak they make them. The fries are really, very good too and I really like the river running through the back patio. Gives your meal a great atmosphere. I also like to call ahead so I can pick it up and eat at home. The hostess and bartender are usually very personable and helpful. I would recommend giving it a try!",

    "text": "I went here last night with a party of 4.  It was about 7pm and the place was pretty dead.  A few years ago I sat outside which was good, but this time I sat inside which was interesting.  The decor is pretty weird with bat stuff everywhere.  Nothing like it around I can tell you that.  The patio is also very interesting as well with a nice water element.  My first trip here was about 4-5 years ago and I tried to be hardcore and order their habanero cheeseburger.  I love love love spicy things but it was a bit over the top for me and I couldn't even finish it.  I was trying to be a bad ass in front of my then girlfriend (now wife) but I just couldn't choke it down.  It was very good but it was just way too spicy for my gringo mouth/stomach.  So on this trip I decided to sample some of their other, more mellow fare.  I was really looking forward to this because I am a big fan of New Mexican cuisine, spicy food, green chili, etc.  * Chips and Salsa - the chips are fresh and excellent.  The 2 salsas they give you I think were pretty fresh as well.  The mild one was ok but was a bit too chunky for me.  The green one had some heat to it but was just ok as well.  It had a weird taste like it had pickled chilis in it or something.  * Green Chili Cheeseburger - good sized, juicy and smothered in green chili sauce.  I ordered it without the bun and have absolutely no idea how someone can eat it with one because it would be a giant mess.  Anyway, I wasn't a big fan.  I just didn't like the taste of the green chili sauce and would have much preferred just strips of fresh roasted green chilies on top of the burger.  My meal came with a side salad which was eh.  * Green Chili Philly - My wife ordered this without the hoagie bun.  I had a taste and I did't think it was very good.  Had some heat to it, but it wasn't very flavorful.  And the flavor it did have was just eh.  * Green Chili Mac n' Cheese - This was my favorite part of the meal.  It wasn't the best mac n' cheese I've ever had but it was pretty good.  It was a bit too soupy instead of think and creamy, but it was good.  Very interesting with the green chili in it.  I wasn't a big fan of the service either.  Our waitress was cracked out.  She kept forgetting things and basically shoved a to-go box in my face before I was finished.  It was all pretty odd because she was friendly and was quick with my diet coke refills.  I think she must have been new to the joint.  I dunno.  I really don't know if and when I'll be back.  There are plenty of other places that serve kinda sorta the same food and this place really didn't stand out in terms of food or service.",

Please take note of the menus! They look like newspapers. I had the Spicy Lobster Croissant with a side of fries dipped in lemon aioli. Really? REALLY. (And REALLY REALLY GOOD). I just wish smoking was prohibited even in the outdoor seating portion of the restaurant. Major bummer when our neighbors decided to take a smoke (while they were eating...can't they just enjoy their food for a few minutes?) Aside from that, I thought it was a fun place to eat! When I was leaving the restaurant I noticed the indoor portion of the restaurant looked pretty small? Oh no... :-\\",

    "text": "My first experience with the \"Bat Cave\" was an evening rendezvous with a friend of mine to watch a basketball game on TV.  It was a late night game, and to be perfectly frank, I don't remember who won - actually I don't remember much of the night at all.  It turns out that they had late night specials for food service workers, and we made the most of it.  But I do remember that it was a fun night, and after looking at the menu, I wanted to try some of their food.  One of the things that intrigued me was that most of the dishes had green chili's - either in the sauce or the actual dish.  Since I love chili's of all sorts, and had never really sampled authentic \"New Mexican\" food, I was looking forward to it.  I tried the green chili stew, the Carne Adovado and  loved them.  Since then I have tried almost all of their menu items, and haven't found one that disappoints me, although I keep coming back to the Carne Adovada.    The service has always been great - my beer never gets empty before another is brought - a really important consideration if you are eating the habanero sauce.  As has previously been described, the decor is a little different, and the bat theme a little over the top.  But it all comes together, and is a fun place especially later in the evening.  And the food is always good.",

    "text": "A friend of mine took me out here for a belated birthday dinner. I have always wanted to try this place so it was a welcome surprise. We were seated on the patio since it was a nice evening however me being the wimp that I am, I had them turn on the heater because it was a little cooler than I thought ( plus it didn't help that I had a a very thin top but that is another story lol)  We ordered Mai Tai's for our drinks and let me tell you those suckers were strong. Luckily for me I was not driving and my dinner companion sipped his sparingly. We had the Mexican Potstickers as an appetizer however although they were good, they were quite salty.  I ordered the Crab Stuffed Poblanos as my main course and my friend ordered Chorizo Stuffed pork chop. Baby, my Poblanos were stuffed with so much crab!! OMG it was soo good. They were huge as well So big that I even after sharing I ended up taking one whole one and a half one home with me. My friend's stuffed pork chop was delicious and the red chile cheddar mash potatoes had just the right kick. He too ended up taking half his meal home because the portion was so good. Oh and if you think I am complaining, believe me I am NOT by any means. I also ordered a pina colada later on (as again I was not driving) and that too was just as strong. They do not skimp on the alcohol and I was very happy about that.  Nothing like spending $9 on a drink and you can't taste any alcohol.  Now although were were stuffed to the gills, we also ordered a piece of key lime pie to share. Delicious to say the least. With the exception of the ultra salty mexican pot stickers, the serve, the food, and most importantly the company was fantastic. If I am ever in the area again, I may have to check out there happy hour.",

We enjoyed a few cocktails from the Late Night menu, and at the suggestion of our server, we ordered the New Mexican pot stickers. All I can say is they were amazing. The sauce was so good, I could've seriously licked the plate clean if I knew no one was watching!

I also had a taste of the Blue Corn Enchiladas which were also pretty tasty.  Having a sample of a few duifferent dishes we all decided that you probably can't go wrong with whatever you order.

Their green chili packs plenty of heat but I'm still missing that deep organic flavor of the Chimayo variety I grew up on as a young kid but this is better than most NM Chili joints. I think most of that high desert land has been bought up by the elites. All our great farmland is gone. Hatch is Hatch but Chimayo was green gold.  Service is excellent!

We were told a ten minute wait for a table because they were busy so she needed to let the servers catch up. So whatever fine that's no big deal. We sat at the bar while we waited. I ordered a frozen marg with light salt on only the outside of the glass, and got a marg in the rocks with normal salt amount. Which they put the salt on the inside of the rim too not just the outside. So there was a lot of salt in the marg. You also couldn't taste any tequila at all. My date just ended up drinking it. The interactions with the bartenders were also really odd. And they were kind of all over the place.  After we got a table I switched to wine and asked the server if the red cuvee they had was more sweet or more dry. And she told me 'it's in the middle'. LOL thanks. So I just went with a Cabernet. Which was mediocre. It was fine, nothing impressive.  Also multiple workers passed by our table not one pre bussed our table. We had multiple drink glasses and appetizer plates when our entrees were brought out. The drink glasses remained throughout the meal.   All that said... because the food and patio atmosphere was good, I think we will return on a different day and hope they have more experienced staff members working who are more knowledgeable of the menu and how to make adult beverages.",

First day I came here I wanted to watch football and the dining room was full and she sat me outside and went out of her way to get football on tvs out there. Honestly if you want great customer service, save some time and ask for her. Also the food is the best around and the $12 bottomless mimosas are hard to beat . By far worth my 30min drive to Carls bad every sunday.",

Just a cool place with unusual, kitchy vibe, good food, solid margaritas, and staff that make you feel like a regular even if you're not.  Their outdoor patio, with a huge fountain, is perfect for brunch when the weather permits. Their darkish bar is perfect for those hot Arizona happy hours where you want to escape the heat and enjoy a tasty beverage.  If you're into spicy food, don't miss their habanero burger.

    "text": "Visited tonight for the first time with a couple of guests, including one from out of town.  Hannah was our server and she was very attentive.  I ordered the carne adovada plate, and I must say it was fantastic!  The serving size was generous, it had great flavor, and came out sizzling - but without anything overcooked at the bottom, as can sometimes happen with a plate or skillet that hot.  Served with a tortilla underneath and another on the side, it was enough food that I used both as makeshift burritos while still having plenty to spare!  And while I am a fan of spicy food, this dish was actually quite mild, and would make a very good introduction to New Mexican cuisine.  The only reason I removed one star was because of the very loud, boisterous tables around us.  This isn't really the fault of the wait staff as they couldn't predict it, but the restaurant is divided into a dining room, bar space with booths, and outdoor seating.  They were putting almost everyone into the dining room, which meant we were seated between an oversized party at a long table and a small but extremely noisy group that came in sometime later and ideally would have been seated by the bar instead.  Once they started laughing, it became a bit of a shouting match between the two groups to hear over each other.  The outdoor area, however, was very peaceful and comfortable even in the evening heat thanks to the waterfall, fountains, and misters.  If it's a nice night, I would certainly recommend the outdoor seating for the ambiance.  All in all, I would definitely recommend Carlsbad Tavern for its uniqueness and delicious food.",

The decor is a little hokey, what with it looking like a cave and being extremely dark, but it was cute. I went with my dad and we shared a green chili burger and a sampler plate (the enchantment platter) that had a chile relleno, enchilada, and a carne adovada burrito. The burger was so so... really nothing special and not a lot of heat there, but the enchantment platter.... that thing was huge, delicious, and covered in gooey cheese. There wasn't a bad item on it. Everything was spicy and flavorful, it makes me want another one as I type about it. There was more than enough food, so I had leftovers, which were equally delicious the next day. I'll be back.

I had their chips and salsa and added their $6 guacamole as well as their tequila shrimp.   The chips and salsa tasted like it was fresh from a store product. Nothing special at all. Their guacamole was lacking flavor. You can make your own guacamole for half the price.  As my entree I tried their adovada plate. Again this dish lacked flavor and the sauce they cooked it in was just to spicy to enjoy. I only ate half and left the rest their. I can handle spicy food but this was just taking away from it.  If you find a good Mexican place please direct me there. Don't bother with this place",

Jalapenos should definitely be included on nachos.     Service was horrible and very slow.  I spilled my ice tea and used my napkin to clean it up.  When I informed our server, she replied \"you're okay\". I had to use the wet napkin because she didn't even bother to bring me another.

We were promptly seated on the outside deck for dinner and our server was very quick to greet us. We ordered two skinny margaritas made with casadores, which were really good.  Nice start. We ordered the red chili chimi with a sopapilla for a buck extra,  and meatloaf for our entrees.   Before the food arrived my husband and I ordered another round of margaritas,  and this is where the night began to go downhill. Mine came out perfect, but I have no idea what the bartenders did to my husband's.  He kept telling me it tasted off. I finally took a sip and almost spit it out; it tasted like flat salty sprite, it was so bizarre.  By the time I had tasted it I figured it was too late to send it back so we just ate the cost and didn't finish the drink. Come to think of it, each time we've visited,  we always are served margaritas that are very inconsistent.   The food arrived pretty quickly,  which was nice,  but we were soon disappointed again.  Both meals were passable but certainly not great.  My meatloaf had nice taste but the mashed potatoes were so bland and honestly looked like they came straight from the \"instant\" box.  My husband's chimi had very little meat and the rice and beans were nothing special.  Our server forgot our spoapilla as well.   If we ever come back,  it won't be for a very long time.  There is only so many times that we will settle for inconsistent drinks and mediocre food.",

It's a bit pricey and everything I've ordered has been \"o.k.\" Green Chile Cheese Crisp was fair. The Chips and Two Salsas was alright and the Homemade Guacamole wasn't much to write home about. Even less impressive was the Tequila Shrimp.  The ambiance is great, especially if it's cool enough to sit outside on the patio. The service has always been \"meh.\" It always seems like the servers have more important things to do and they're not very attentive.  The best part of Carlsbad Tavern is the atmosphere..but, that's not enough to raise my review above 3 stars.",

    "text": "Michael Martin Murphy might have said \"it's a long way back to New Mexico\", but in Phoenix, you can take a short ride down Hayden from Old Town Scottsdale to Carlsbad Tavern for a great taste of New Mexico.  this place is really cool.  As you might be able to gather, the restaurant is \"named after\" the Carlsbad Caverns.  (Did you know that a Cave is technically not the same thing as a Cavern but that a Cavern is a cave?)  The ambiance/decor of the restaurant is a cavern theme.  When you approach the building from the outside, it looks like you're approaching a \"cavern\".  When you walk inside, the restaurant looks like a cavern!  There is a moat with water outside that runs through the patio area.   I've been to CT for large lunches and smaller casual dinners.  I love the patio outside for this!  Oh, on the cooler spring evenings, that patio is addicting and intoxicating.  Now, for the food.  I have ordered several things from that menu.  I enjoy the Green Chile Stew.  It was the first thing I ordered when I went there, and I'm one of those weirdo creatures of habit, I\"ve probably ordered that 75% of the times I've been there.  I've ordered the Caverns Chicken Salad and I think it was Lobster Enchilladas more than once.  Their Sopas are very addictive.  You've been warned.   what I like about their food is that every darn thing is so cheesy!  They put a lot of cheese their food.  If you're looking for HOT/Heat, they can certainly spice up your life.  Their menu warns you about the spice level of certain food items.  I would say heed it, but you won't listen to me, now will you.  I tried that Habanero Burger and got half the pepper on the side... it was not that bad at all.  hehe...  Give them a a try, you will like it.",

Personally though...wasn't all that thrilled.   The Good:  Cool looking place.   The Meh:  Maybe it's just because I discovered I'm not a Green Chili fan...or maybe a fan of the way they do it.  I got the Blue Corn Enchiladas.  Just seemed like it was more spicy than flavorful.  The rice was good.  Black beans were tasty (and I'm not a bean fan).  The enchiladas though...didn't seem like they had anything done to them.  Meet wrapped in the tortilla (didn't even notice if the shrimp one had anything in it).  At least it was all slathered in chili and cheese...  I'd give it another shot though but I would try something else off a different section of the menu.  Plus...pricey.  Yeah..it was a decent amount of food...but $11 for a couple enchiladas seems excessive.    The Bad: I don't know...maybe I should've stood up and waved my hands around...but just seemed like I didn't really get much in the way of service.  Yes...I sat at the bar...but it seemed like others were getting attention (regulars perhaps?).  Took awhile before interest was shown to take my order...then awhile again after I was finished to get the bill.  Overall:  Cool looking place, kinda pricey.  Service, meh.  Food items, not bad.  I'll rate again if/when go again and try something different.",

To me that always means pricey but I was pleasantly surprised to walk in and look at the Mexican food selection to find that everything was under $15.  So my first disappointment was paying for the chips and salsa.  Paying, really?  The waiter was generous with the salsa and chips but that still disappointed me.  Food: Chips and salsa-  Salsa wasn't good.  I mean it was OK but being a Mexican food lover, I've tasted many salsas in my day and this was mediocre at best.  Chile Rellenos-  These were delicious and would highly recommend them.  Also, the rice is fantastic.  Not the biggest pork fan but I still found these amazing.  Machaca & Tomatillo Chimichanga- Also delicious. I mean it is a deep fried burrito but still very well done.  Sopas- you can add a sopapia for .75 each.  We each had one which came with honey as our dessert.  They were very good and not too much or too little.  Service: Fan-freakin- tastic.  Our server was great.  He was extremely attentive and friendly.    So this place is more like 3 1/2 stars probably but we ate at Dick's Hideaway the next night which was much more impressive and thus, because I am comparing, I have to give this 3 stars.  I would recommend it and come back!",

It's definitely a fun atmosphere and the food is actually good (sometimes). I found the service to be nice as well - although they seem to frantically run around like chickens with their heads cut off not knowing what to do next. Their stress stresses me out. If you have kids, they'll love this as a treat and will probably remember it forever.  Their margaritas are average and their mexican food is actually shitty and 80s and standard. It's edible, but not good. Their American food is pretty good though. You're going to go here for the atmosphere - bringing you back to smoking jackets and hanging out in the den.

One was frozen solid and the other tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge for way too long. We told our server who apologized right away and told us it would be removed from the check. 5 minutes later he comes back and tells us his \"Manager\" refused to give the refund. We kindly asked for the manager. Judith strolls out and leans on the vacant chair at the table and says \"How was everything tonight?\" Shocked she didn't already know everything was NOT ok; I again began to explain, from the beginning, the issue with our dessert. She said she was sorry but she wasn't going to give us a refund. Judith said she tasted the dessert in the back and it tasted fine to her and that due to that an the fact that she felt \"more than enough was eaten\" from each plate  she figured we just wanted to get out of paying for dessert. Disgusted with her penny pinching approach to restaurant management and customer service, I gave in and told her to give me the bill. Before walking away she said \"well I can maybe give you a discount\" and she walked away. We paid the $60 tab for 2 people and left knowing we would never EVER go back to this establishment. On the way out we found out that Judith the \"Manager\" we were dealing with was in fact the \"Co-Owner\" of the restaurant. With owners like that the only thing keeping that place afloat is the chefs that make the \"FRESH\" food. Judith you should be ashamed of yourself!   P.S. There is a great show on the Food Network called \"Restaurant:Steakout\" where a very successful restaurateur (that means owner Judith)  comes in to horribly mismanaged restaurants and fixes them. While doing so, he hammers in to the owners head that \"THE CUSTOMER IS KING\". Hopefully by watching this show you will learn. Good Luck!",

I'd never even heard of the place, and when she suggested it I looked it up online, found the website and decided it was a great idea.  The food is a New Mexican menu, complete with plenty of chilies in a lot of the dishes. The atmosphere on the outside look nothing what you experience inside. The bar looks comfy, and the patio (where we sat) is nice and intimate, plenty warm with the fireplace and heaters. The service was (mostly) attentive, only lacking at the point when we needed our server towards the end of our meal.  I had the Machaca & Tomatillo Chimichanga as my main course, M had the Portales Portobello Sandwich. Both were very good. The mushroom was a perfect tenderness, not too springy or chewy. The flavors were even, and the chipotle mayo a tad too spicy for M. My Chimi was tasty, the tortilla a nice combo of crunchy on the outside and chewy inside. The Machaca was flavorful and tender with a nice accent from the tomatillo. I was also impressed with the side dishes my meal came with. The rice was tender and light, with just the right amount of  slices and cheese (not too much of either). The black bean were cooked evenly and had a heat that comes up on you well after you've taken a bite.  I liked my experience, and look forward to going back again sometime.",

Especially when its not an inferno outside on their patio...surrounded by chili pepper lights and a small creek complete with foot bridge and tiki-ish bar...

Not much different, chili pepper lights and New Mexico license plates... excellent music and good vibe all around.    Spending most of my early 20s in the Midwest, I hadnt had a whole ton of New Mexican food before but let me tell you, I am now a whole hearted fan.  Lots of green chile menu items, burritos, enchiladas...  My recent favorites are the crab stuffed green chiles, and the carlsbad chicken salad.  HUGE portions so bring your apetite.    Prices are average but great for the amount of food you get...between $8 and $25 for steaks etc.  Perfect service, friendly staff.  Dont forget to try a prickly pear margarita--best in town!!",

    "text": "The hubs and I went here last night with a couple of friends. I have been here before years ago and remembered that it never really stuck in my mind as a MUST go to place.   First off, What restaurant in AZ charges for Chips and Salsa!?!?! SERIOUSLY, Who does that! The regular salsa doesn't have much flavor to, the salsa Verde is good, but has a weird lingering after taste.   Secondly, their newspaper menus are sooo annoying! They are all floppy and when four people are sitting at a table trying to open them and read them it gets a bit crowded and elbows in your face.   Thirdly, the service was lacking. I had to ask for a straw a couple times, they give you straws for sodas, but not for waters. We saw our waitress maybe twice. We asked for a side of enchilada sauce and they charges a $1 for it.   Fourth. The food. Its not terrible, but its nothing spectacular. The flour tortillas taste like they are store bought and not fresh. Their jalapeno mashed potatos are pretty dope, I will give them that much.   Would I ask to go back here? No. Would I put up a fuss if someone else wanted to go here? Nah. I'd go again....Maybe just bring my own chips and salsa!",

Their Carne Adovada is outstanding and the Lobster Enchiladas are magnificent, especially the three chile sauce.  One of the things I love about this place is that they serve spicy food with a huge depth of flavor, something that is very hard to accomplish.  If you haven't been, I highly recommend checking it out. You won't be sorry, except if you have the Habenero Burger, then you might be a little sorry about half way through it...very spicy. Enjoy!  :-)",

    "text": "So I should have known this place was bad when I pulled up and there was no parking available but they had a valet service that conveniently had reserved spots. So after being FORCED to valet park my wife and I went inside and were promptly seated(kind of strange since there were no free parking spots). I ordered an green chilly cheese crisp for us to share and my entree was a green chilly pork burro. The cheese crisp was flavorless and unappetizing. The burro tasted like it had ben PRE-MADE and over cooked in the microwave upon order. The pork was dry and flavorless. I would not recommend this place to anyone because it's NASTY and does not do Arizona Mexican cuisine any justice at all.*****AVOID at ALL COSTS*****",

The restaurant itself has an odd decor that will have you thinking more of LOST, or Gilligan's Island instead of the famous caverns. I believe it used to be a Polynesian restaurant back in the day, many moons ago.   The food is great here and the portions huge. They do have some Mexican beers on draft which is also great. My wife loves and swears by the Lobster enchiladas and my buddy and I spilt the Habenero burger. Thank god we split it as its by far the hottest burger this side of the Rio Grande.   Carlsbad does a really great chili both red and green and I haven't veered to far off the menu for other entrees.   I recommend it if your looking for great casual evening out with Friends or if your just driving by and in the mood for a great lunch.",

They should probably have warned us about the habanero sauce that came with one of the dishes (sorry, can't remember which one)... but after the initial burn, it was really good.  (If you like really hot & spicy, the habanero burger is awesome!).  Our waitress was excellent!  While we weren't a very demanding group, our server was on-the-ball and very professional.    The decor is very unique, as well...in keeping with the \"tavern' theme - there are bat-like designs everywhere.  If you visit during the cooler months, sit outside on the patio near the water or be sure to come at night and hang out next to the fireplace.  Fair warning, parking can be a bit of a bear as it is very limited.   Overall, it's a nice place and good food.",

The first few times I was here there were always long waits, but I was here last on a Saturday night at about 730 and it was probably half empty...hopefully they aren't losing too much business.  My favorite things here are the lobster enchiladas and the crab stuffed poblano peppers. The lobster enchilada plate comes with two enchiladas, rice pilaf and asparagus.  It's topped with a really nice mild spiced, lobster-y, tomato-y, creamy sauce.  I recommend saving a little rice until the end so you can easily clean up all the extra sauce.  The enchiladas are not too big, but you're definitely full after finishing them.  The poblanos are awesome.  I'm pretty sure they're broiled and there's a great crisp on top of the peppers.  It's a pretty rich dish and somewhat spicy, but the sweetness of the peppers brings everything together well.    The appetizers are good.  Last time I was there I had the nachos and mexican potstickers.  The nachos were awesome...chips were crunchy, plenty of cheese, and they came with green chiles on top, which gave it a great lil kick.  The potsitckers were not anything special, but kinda an interesting idea with the asian/mexican mix.   Finally, a trip to Carlsbad Tavern is not complete without the sopapillas.  They serve them warm with honey.  No matter how full you are, there is always room for a sopapilla or two.",

    "text": "Visited Carlsbad Tavern on Friday night, and I have to start off by saying that the service and scenery were fantastic. Cozy, with music a little loud but not overly so, a lovely outside and a comfortable inside. The service was great - never had to wait on a refill, drinks were kept topped off and ready. The portions were generous, and nobody was at risk of leaving hungry.  We started with the nachos, which were great. Excellent chips, good toppings, well balanced; out of six of us, five ordered the tacos for the entree and all but one really liked them. I ordered the habanero sliders, and they were...pretty alright? They were a little dry, but there was plenty of fresh pepper cooked into the beef, and a reasonable spice. I also apparently misread the menu, as I thought it was served with ghost pepper cheese and fries, not ghost pepper cheese fries. Those were, unfortunately, lacking.  The texture of the fries was fantastic, top notch potato, but the actual ghost pepper cheese just...barely existed at all. Turns out it was more of a powder added to the fries - the cheese flavor was good, in all fairness, but there wasn't a hint of pepper to them. I know they have to take it a little easy on the ghost pepper since most people can't handle it, but I at least expected some of that wonderful smokeyness that ghost pepper carries and for the heat to be at least close to the habanero burger's. In this case, it might as well have just been cheddar fries - perfectly good, but not what I was expecting.  The happy hour deals were solid; if you enjoy spice and are in the area, Carlsbad Tavern is a good choice (and the tacos came well recommended), but I don't think I'd go out of the way for it, either.",

It was a spur of the moment stop for us so I walked in to get us seated and the older woman at the front did not have a welcoming demeanor. She was out of uniform so I assume she must have been a member of management. However, I let her know there was five of us but got no reply or acknowledgement so I said it a second time. Then in a snotty tone asked if we had reservations. I should have turned around & left but instead I stayed & let her know we did not. She sat us down & then told me she'd have to throw my brand new Starbucks tea out or I have to put it under table at my feet. Uh no ma'am..i just bought this tea before my party decided to stop & eat & I didn't want to leave it the hot car to get warm while we ate. It's not like I wasn't going to order their food & beverages. I reluctantly took my tea back to the car but I was upset so I decided not to order anything to eat or drink.  Three members of my party decided they still wanted to eat so they ordered. Their feedback was that the burger and enchantment platter were good.  That said, the enchantment platter looked great so I ordered one to go with no beans. Our server confirmed my request and then we waited a really long time for it to come out. Finally it was out & we're ready to go but I check the order for accuracy. The order that was supposed to have no beans had extra beans! We didnt have time to wait for a new order so we asked for a refund. However, we were not offered a new order we were offered rice on the side. Uh no thank you...we asked for no beans for a reason. I don't think I have to say I have food allergy each time.  If I ask for no beans on anything I expect the kitchen to do as requested. Unfortunately I don't have a review of how food tastes.   Our server was very nice but very busy. This rating is not a reflection of his service. I am giving them a 3 star because the others in my group seemed to be satisfied with their food. Otherwise it'd  be lower.  And yes by the time I got to my car my yea was warm &almost all the ice melted so double loss for me.",

The bar area is very cozy and looks like a place I would come to just hang out for a drink or two. The hostess was so friendly and we talked a bit about me being a native New Mexican. She made some suggestions on the menu and asked what I like to eat in New Mexico. When I told her she brought me out a sample of the carne adovado and TRUE Hatch Green chile. My waiter was Kenny S and he was so funny. We hit it off right away. I ordered the Carne and to drink a Mexican Punch. The meal came and it was really good. I'm used to refried beans not black beans but they were good. The rice was dry and tasteless but he carne was so tender, I'm used to having it smothered with red chile so I ordered sour cream to off set the heat, not needed it wasn't covered in chile, this was a different change. The meat was seasoned perfectly and was so tender. A definite A+ there.  I had a Mexian Punch and all I can say is I plan on making thise at home. AMAZING!!!! All in all I would say they do New Mexican pretty well here. I plan on coming back again no doubt.",

    "text": "This restaurant serves Tex-Mex -New-Mexican Inspired cuisine. The atmosphere is fun and interesting. They offer a large patio with a large water feature and inside looks like a cave. When we entered we were greeted and sat promptly.   I started with a Margarita..The margarita was fine but it was garnished with a lime that has seen better days and maybe the dishwasher already. I know it's a little thing ...... I didn't feel like complaining about it but it turned my stomach and I was sort of afraid about what dinner would be like.  For dinner I had the Filet Mignon. My steak had really nice grill marks on it and was cooked to my liking. The steak seemed unseasoned and neither me or my husband could taste the pecan wood or salt or pepper. It was just plain beef. I didn't see beans in my plate's description but they sat my steak over a pile of beans that I didn't want so my husband took them. My steak came with mushroom and cheese enchiladas. The mushrooms were seasoned nicely and tasted good but the cheese inside tasted like process American Cheese that I don't care for. I NOTE that this doesn't mean this is bad it only means I would prefer a different cheese. My husband tasted the enchiladas too and he confirmed that they taste like processed American cheese. I wasn't expecting that...My enchiladas were also a little dry. I didn't think my plate was bad enough to send back or complain about because the beef was ok and the enchiladas were just a little dried out. I know I ruined the flavor of the enchiladas by using the Carlsbad Hot Sauce on them but the sauce juiced them up and the Carlsbad hot sauce is mighty tasty.  My husband had the Carne Adovada. He said it was ok but the pork was dry.  Our server was very pleasant and we were thanked for coming.  I feel I hit them on an off night because when I look at other people's pictures of the same food their pictures of the food look much better. Their food looks moist and melty cheesy unlike our plates.  2.5 stars rounded up because of service and the interesting atmosphere.",

    "text": "I had lunch there a few days ago. I was glad to see it busy for lunch. We sat at the bar and the bartender gave us good service. In general I am hesitant to sit at the bar at most places because I feel like more times than not the service lacks something. But I can't complain about the service.  My complaint is the food. I remember going here years ago when they first opened and my recollection was that the food was special.   This trip I got the chili relleno which comes stuffed in pork. It was terrible. I was thinking about it today and why it was bad which is why I'm leaving a review so others avoid this dish. Maybe I should have gone with the famous habanero burger?  It will probably be a long time before I give them another try so I'm saying this hoping I remember if I ever go back.  My issue is this. My guess is that who ever cooked the food didn't care. Relleno is best when the entire pepper is evenly covered with sauce. Not just a squirt slapped half hazardously on top. Take some pride in the art of cooking it's an art form.  I notice 99 percent of the time when a relleno comes out unevenly covered that I should expect the dish to taste half hazard.   The pork had a strong porky flavor. I can't describe it any other way. Not flavorful but meaty like it possible isn't fresh. Maybe the pork was cooked in the same half hazard manner.   When I was eating I had something crunchy that I assumed was a stem so I desperately put it in my napkin. As to not gross out my buddy who was joining me. Then a few bites later the same thing. Could have been cheese or pork that crispy but I had a few of that so I doubt it was a stem from the pepper   This gets me thinking maybe someone who is cooking food with love and care might remove the stem when they stuff the relleno.  I can't imagine this restaurant is using the same original recipe from when they first opened. Maybe over the years new cooks lost the tradition of making this dish properly.   I hope the owner of this restaurant reads this reviews and has a come to Jesus moment. Don't blame slower sales on local competition. But on lack of love and art in your food. Locals like old long time places with a feeling of nostalgia.  I'm going to make an assumption that at some point the restaurant was sold to new owners or that the original owner is no longer involved in the day to day operations.  I have to wonder how much longer this place will stay in business. I feel like they need a visit from restaurant impossible.",

The waiter was great and he wasn't the cook, so he still received a 20 % trip.  The food wasn't his fault. Very disappointed  Thank you for your response but we did send back part of our appetizer. But when the entree came , I seriously didn't have the heart or the nerve to send it back too. So I just as a mannerly individual politely let it be. But now you have my review.

I ended up having to order chips and salsa to have something else to try to get the hot taste out of my mouth. If the rice and beans didn't have so much green chili on them, then I could have eaten that instead of chips. Too bad almost all of the New Mexican entrees have green chili in them. Great flavor though!  My two dining partners both ordered the cheeseburger with fries. The seasoned fries were excellent and plentiful. The burgers looked delicious and they said they really liked them.",

    "text": "I've been playing catchup with many of friends and no better way to get together than over a good meal and drinks.   One the main reasons we hit up Carlsbad is because it's my buddy's local spot and our meetup location for some night bicycle riding with dinner and drinks to follow.   They have a good discounted happy hour after 10pm. The crowd numbers can be seasonal so a lot of times it's pretty empty, but service is really good and prompt to accommodate. I don't think I've eaten outdoors but the patio area is nice and ideal when the weather cools to have a nice size group meeting.  This trip, I went away from my usual hamburger & fries (which I've done many times in the past) and went for the Fish & Chips. It came with this salsa salad on the side... I didn't mess with it but my buddy said it was good. Nice batter, texture and crunch for the fish and a few Moscow Mules to top it off.   Future visits are planned and will look to expand my choices with the menu as they are 'New Mexican Cuisine restaurant'",

    "text": "I've been meaning to check out Carlsbad for some time, and finally made it a point to stop in and give it a try.  We came during Happy Hour and managed to do so on their Taco Tuesday, so we did both. First of all, our server was very kind, hospitable, and full of pep. Unlike everyone else, we chose to sit outside in the warm afternoon air and enjoy the scenery (waterfall and desert/cavern decor). As for the food, not bad. Definitely a step up from say, Macayos. The grilled chicken quasadilla was a little dry, but flavorful. The Mexican potstickers were like a party in my mouth. Their street tacos on special were very good, especially the fillet steak taco.   Yes, there are more authentic Mexican food places in town, but overall, we had a good experience here and would consider visiting again.",

That kind of humor makes me want to come back already!  My waiter Ryan's asked if I'd ever been there.  I had not so I said he explained the menu and spiciness of the food and brought samples of the sauces!  MUCH appreciated.   I ordered the Cabo Wabo margarita and shrimp tacos., then decided to check in! Surprise, free chips and salsa.  The red is way good, and I'm from Texas where we pick our restaurants based on the salsa!  Drink is damned DELICIOUS!  Shrimp tacos are very good.  Three tacos and a bowl of black beans for $8.75 during happy hour?  That's a great deal!    The only thing I didn't care for was the bowl/cup the salsa was served in.  It came with a spoon so I'm probably supposed to be spooning the salsa onto my chip, but for a girl from Texas that's just too damned much trouble!  We like to dip our chips and the sides of the cup are a bit too tall for that.    Wish we had a Carlsbad Tavern in Austin!  I will definitely be back next time I'm in town.",

I suggest going and sitting at the bar whenever possible and DO NOT go with a large party and expect to get taken care of properly.

Cool unique ambiance, nice menu, good staff, service has always been very good. Hint: nice late night Happy Hour for you restaurant peeps kitchen open late til like 1AM or so!   One thing that I dont like is that they dont allow dogs on their huge (often empty) patio. My dog even has service dog tags and the owner wouldnt let him in so we dont go on Sundays anymore with the folks. I dont mark em down for this, but some people ONLY go where they can bring their dog and they could do it here and it would be awesome. We just go somewhere else now instead. Read this and start letting dogs there and we will throw a huge Yappy Hour on the patio and pack the place dude!",

Chicken was dry and nachos had no flavor. Salsa was not spicy and very watered down. Chips were good and hot however. The food itself was OVERPRICED and just okay. Won't be back. It may be called Carlsbad tavern because its BAD. Also there is a rock for decoration inside the restaurant that says \"beware\". It should be on the outside warning people not to go in. Also their parking situation is crazy. I had to park down 2 blocks. Also I should mention it took 20 minutes for someone to come over to the table to take our drink order.  P.S.  If you wanted chicken wings, which my friend really did, you cannot get them any time. Its only for the late night menu. how hard is it to make chicken wings?? Why only LATE night?",

You have to order chips & salsa-salsa was not very good-not spicy at all. Staff was very friendly but took a minute to get the server to continue checking on the table. Overall not bad but would not suggest this restaurant if your looking for good, authentic Mexican food.",

    "text": "This was probably the 6th time here and each time I get something different. Past favorites of ours are the Green Chile Stew (only the Hombres eat this), Great Tortilla Soup,  Enchiladas are nummy.    My husband and I split an order if (2) Crab Stuffed Poblanos and though I found a rather 'light' crab flavor, it was very tasty. The pepper appeared dipped in a coating that was spicy without being hot...not a bad thing as too hot and I'd not have tasted the crab at all. Their black beans are great and my husband gave a thumbs-up on the Margarita.  And as always, the wait staff is excellent. The patio, which is outstanding, was 3/4 full at 10:00 pm (after a trip to SMIL) and I always had a full glass of iced tea, the food came quickly.  The staff was very busy but kept everyone happy.  Nice job, Carlsbad!",

I love that they're open late, and the food is always amaze balls and they give you a fairly large side portion. Drinks off menu are great and booze is a plenty in the cocktails. However my waiter was too busy to make my drink and then it didn't come in the traditional glass, I'm a stickler for by the book drinks. Plus, I was overcharged nearly $3 for my food, that's serious, a little bit here and there could be a lot. Although I'll keep coming back. Patio is to die for, during the summer it's great but wear bug spray because the water attracts mosquitoes.",

YES, YES, YES good job!  & fresh roasted Hatch chili!!!   Is the chili stuffed with a delectable Mexican cheese mix (or just  jack cheese)?  Well, this place uses a Good mix of jack & something else....no complaints.   What kind of batter? egg? breading?  Not sure but whatever they use it works well.  All in all, the Chiles Rellenos here are great!    Beware it's a very spicy dish so don't order it if you don't like it hot!    My hubby ordered the fish & chips?  I know!

However we had their New Mexican Potstickers and they were pretty good. Chips were fresh and salsas were tasty.

I said \"hello, for three\" and she turned to the gentleman (who was also Hispanic) and said \"these aren't your people?\" He said no and she said \"surprising, you would think so\" I then was a little baffled and said excuse me, then she ignored me and said follow me and sat us down.

It's almost as if they were masking the lack of flavor with spice. The salsa was mediocre (at best) and the chips were okay. Entrees start around $15 and the chips and salsa are not free (huge negative).   Luckily, I have this handy dandy Yelp app on my phone that scored us both the free chips and salsa AND 7% off our meal, putting $2.23 back in my pocket.   It was over 100 out and yet the misters outside made it feel so nice, so for ambiance (outside), I give the place a 9. The place was quiet for a Saturday but walking in, you would've guessed we were entering an amusement park. They really focused on their \"curb appeal\" with this place.  With a ridiculous amount of restaurants to choose from in the area and being so new, this place is off the list on places we will return to, but in all, it was fine.",

    "text": "\"A good spicy challenge strikes a balance between flavor and fear.\"Adam Richman  Carlsbad Tavern (CT) is a curious anomaly in the Yelp world; they're listed as \"Mexican,\" but they're far from your average Mexican, or Tex-Mex joint. They're actually their own genre known as New Mexican Cuisine which relies heavily on the New Mexico's State Vegetable: the Chile Pepper*. Being a Spice-Crazed Pepper Head, CT is right up my alley as almost every dish here has some kind of fresh or dried Chile incorporated into it. CT was actually the very first place I ate when visiting AZ, and has become my go-to spot whenever I'm in town. Now, let's get to the food!  Habanero Cheeseburger- The 2009 Food Network Magazine \"Burger of AZ\" comes with the special caveat of \"You order it, you own it\"--because the spice level on this dish is pretty extreme. They mix in Habanero Chili Powder into the freshly-ground beef and top it with some spicy Jalapeno Jack Cheese. It's a good thing it comes with a side salad because you'll need it to help cool down your mouth as the heat continues to build in your mouth. The burger itself is excellent with a pillowy soft bun, perfectly-cooked beef and spicy goodness made this the best burger I'd had in a good while! Spice Level 8 out of 10!    Green Chile Mac & Cheese- One of my favorite dishes here at CT, as the creamy, melted cheese and seasoning of \"Christmas\" Chiles makes this another Chile Heads dream. The fresh Jalapeno flavor really stands out in this dish. Spice level 4 out of 10.    Prickly Pear Caramel Flan- Words can't describe how amazingly good this Flan is! It's so decadent that it melts in your mouth and coats your tongue in a tantalizing array of creamy, sweet and velvety softness that you'll keep wanting more. They should call this dish \"Desert Crack.\"  Spice Level 0  Service & Ambiance- As CT's name suggests, the restaurant is a homage to the famous New Mexican Caves, and the decor throughout is representative. It's kitschy, cheesy and gauche--but I love it! Bat posters, Chile Pepper light strings, metal Bats and an awesome waterfall are just a few of the things you'll see at CT! It's done in a fun, tongue-in-cheek kinda way and you can tell they don't take themselves too seriously here which is to be admired. I highly recommend dining al fresco here, as the patio is much more inviting than the dark interior. The service here is always impeccable, and my last trip was no different. Our waitress (I wish I could remember her name) was amazing--kept my iced tea full, got our orders right and had a great attitude and sense of humor.  Value- Pretty standard AZ pricing of around $10-15 for an entree, but the quality ingredients makes this a good value in my opinion.  CT is a must go for any Pepper Head and for anyone else looking for a delicious meal in a clean, comfortable and fun environment. Highly recommended for spicy goodness--and that Flan!! *swoon*      *While a Chile Pepper is technically a fruit, culinarily speaking it is considered a vegetable.",

I highly suggest starting with the chips and salsa and a house margarita, for an entree I HIGHLY suggest the Osso Bucco! Some of the most tender, roasted pork I have ever had! Servings are well sized, and typically come with rice and beans.   Overall pretty good service, however every once and a while you will get a slow waiter (typically when sitting outside).   The happy hour is descent; however I think the Margaritas should be $1 or 2 cheaper based on quality and size.   I love the outdoor seating and when the weather is nice you can't beat a margarita and mexican food next to the waterfall.  Keep up the good work!",

    "text": "Carlsbad Tavern is hit or miss for me. Their food is pretty good, and they have some unique options. Their New Mexican potstickers were good, except they were obviously microwaved. their filet tacos are good, except they have come out cold on occasion. Usually their black beans are delicious, however the last time we went they were ice cold, and had no seasoning, as if they had just come out of the can. The macacha beef chimi is really good, although it often has more onions than beef in it. The food here is spicy, so if you get indigestion easily I would pop a zantec before you eat!   The service is also hit or miss. Sometimes we'll get someone friendly and attentive, other time's we'll get someone that basically acts like a dick. I hate having servers that are dicks. It kinda ruins the whole meal. I work in the service industry, no matter how terrible of a day I'm having or how rude of a client I have, I'm still NICE. Not nice servers makes me sad.   Sorry, this review is going on and on and on. Basically, I like this place. I just wish they could step it up a little. Be a little more consistent, ya know?",

I would have loved to sit outside but members of our party voted against it.   Other than that I wasn't impressed. Everything was spicy. Everything! The beans and rice that accompanied most meals. The pico de gallo was on fire. The guacamole needed a fire extinguisher. The only thing on the menu that wasn't spicy was the cheeseburger. I wish someone would have told me this before we sat down.    Our service also left much to be desired. We were there about 2pm on a Friday and the place was pretty empty. Regardless of that fact our server still forgot everything! He forgot drinks. He forgot sides. He forgot refills. He did not forget his snarky attitude when we asked for recommendations on what wasn't spicy. Oh but he did forget to tell us that things like guac and beans were spicy   If you like spicy (which most of Arizona does apparently) try it here, but I won't be back.",

    "text": "We were there very early this evening, so that may be the reason we had a less-than-5 star experience... We ordered off the happy hour menu -- crab cakes and potstickers. We also ordered the green chili mac and cheese.   The food was VERY good, for bar food. Nice spice in the crab cakes and the aioli that came with them -- and the salad greens on the plate were outstanding. The pot-stickers were okay, but not on the same level. The mac and cheese was good -- but could have used a few more minutes under the broiler to make them a little less soupy.   We got a side order of guac and should have gone with the full order.   Where Carlsbad lost us though, was the margarita. I know it was somewhat my mistake -- I ordered the house marg and asked them to substitute Grand Marnier. When the marg arrived, I couldn't taste any GM and asked the waitress to check if maybe it had been left out. She shouted over to the bartender to confirm that he had added the GM -- and of course he said he had... Oh well, without the taste of the GM, it was just a plain old margarita. I would have paid $5 for a decent dose of GM, but whatever.   I decided to pass on the margarita and just drank my water instead. The margarita sat on the table untouched throughout the meal and the waitress never asked about it. It would have been a nice touch to have had her at least offer to get me something else...   So I'm knocking a star off for service...   But the outside patio IS great looking and I recommend you head out there when you arrive. I'm not sure why this place shows up as a tapas bar in the Yelp listing, but it's really not a tapas place. It's a New Mexico themed bar/restaurant with very good food and I'm sure most of the staff is very good as well, judging from the other reviews... Don't pass this up on my account -- but do remember my experience when ordering your margarita...",

When we ate here it was a little chilly still at night, so the heat lamps were appreciated.  Service was a little spotty all night.  We ran dry on water a few times, and it seemed like it took forever for our food to come out.  We had some chips and salsa (mediocre, unfortunately, and not free, doubly unfortunately) to tide us over, but things were definitely not moving quickly.  The main courses, though, were good.  I had the stacked enchiladas, which were so big and different they barely registered as enchiladas.  They had good spice to them, though, and I liked being able to have two different meats going on.  The fried egg was a bit unnecessary, though.  I was hoping for a runny yolk, because I love me some runny yolks, but it didn't have one, and thus didn't add much.  Tanya enjoyed her Tesuque chicken salad.  It did have a surprising amount of spice to it between the veggies and the tasty dressing.  The jalapeno bacon was good, too, but the tortilla crusted chicken was more crust than chicken, which was a bit disappointing.  Our companions had lobster enchiladas, which seemed to be the biggest hit of the night, and crab stuffed poblanos, which were also popular.  I didn't get to try those, so that's just hearsay, but they appear to be safe bets.  Overall, things were mostly good, but there were some little issues that held it back from being a great meal.  I would definitely come back, though.",

The blood orange was a bit sweet but still good. The Cabo margs were our faves. We tried the Cherry mule and the Jalisco, which had a good spice flavor. The hatch chile sauce was not very spicy today but still had good flavor. The Carlsbad Brochettes were cooked perfectly and the cheese crisp was good. I am a spicehead, so I wanted a bit more heat but everyone else loved it. We didn't try the regular menu items today, but I will update when we return. The real reason I am taking the time to write this review is for the service we received. Lottie was FANTASTIC.  As you know from reading my reviews, I fully believe good service makes the food and drinks taste better. It's becoming a rare experience. Lottie had great suggestions, knew when a drink was low or empty, and had a fun and energetic personality. I will ask for her when we return for sure. Good experience! The bat cave looks fun...but if I see a bat, I'm done.",

The rice was undercooked, chicken was flavorless, and the beans looked like bat skat. The chimi was average and a tad spicy.   Their bat brew was alright... A bit sour. My friend had a random ass vegetable in his burrito (broccoli). Maybe they thought the bat brew would help us forget but nah boo.   Leaving the restaurant felt like exiting a Disneyland ride. Maybe if they put forth more effort towards the food than the atmosphere then maybe I'll try it again.",

Pros: -The restaurant looks like it could be a Disneyland installment. Take that as you will.  -Portions are generous, come hungry! -Anything involving lobster or a cream sauce here is a winner  Cons: -Anything involving non-seafood meat is dry or overcooked in my book -I personally like higher sauce/veggie-to-meat ratios, but they usually pack their food full of MEAT  :) Still love you Tavern.

I decided to have the habanero cheeseburger cooked rare, it came with fries and a salad. It was tasty but could have been cooked a little less, it arrived more on the medium than rare, it's all good though, it tasted good. It wasn't too spicy. It had chopped habaneros in it and was topped with jalapeno cheese, lettuce, onion, and tomato. I would've liked a little more heat to it though. The fries were cooked well and I didn't try the salad as I was getting full off of the burger. The service was excellent and friendly. I will go again, next time I'll just make sure the burger is a little more rare ;)",

I came here with my dad, so my entrees were strictly vegetarian.  I could smell the seafood and could tell the specialties here are more seafood oriented.  I will have to update this once I try something like a crab enchilada, but the smell was wonderful.  The flavors in my vegetarian burro and my dad's blue corn cheese enchiladas were amazing.  It wasn't so hot spicy, but there were a lot of amazing flavors.  If you get an item, I do highly recommend them to put easy on the cheese because I felt like half my plate had melted cheese.  I got a skinny margarita to go along with it.    The one downside is that they don't offer complimentary chips and salsa.  We actually ordered some, and it came after our food.  I was a little bit disappointed by the cost of it and the late delivery, which is why I give it a 3-star.  This will probably change after another visit, but this is just my first impression.",

It was a good pour of vodka and plenty of add-ons for the drink. I then had a mimosa which was good.   The guys got some food which looked awesome but I was too full to even try. Fiance got tequila shrimp (I think that's what it was called) but its an app of grilled shrimp on a bed of black beans.

Don't know if the front is policed by staff b4 opening 4 day but drinks were left on ledge of entrance wall at noon.  The french fries and  were very good.

    "text": "I think the prices are a little high but the outside patio is fantastic. I think happy hour here is good, but it only goes until 6 pm. I've had a good number of things off their menu:  - Tacos: Three tacos for $14 is a little too pricey to me for what they are, but the same dish for $7 at HH is spot on. The black beans are incredibly tasty (lots of spices and vegetarian), and the tacos are traditionally what you would expect. They subbed in vegetarian mexican rice for the meat for me, which was great. Love the guacamole on them, but otherwise standard ingredients for tex mex. - Chips, salsa, & guacamole: Good but I hate paying for chips & salsa at a mexican food place, especially one whose prices should afford a free basket. The guacamole is delicious. The salsas are pretty good, nothing to write home about but good all the same. - Nachos: My friends love this dish, it's giant and enough to feed two. Unfortunately there aren't much of toppings on it besides the meat, beans, & cheese. - French fries: These are AMAZING! You get a heaping amount with a burger and they are perfection. Soft on the inside, beer battered or otherwise some kind of crust crusty on the outside, and perfectly seasoned. I'm pretty sure I'd be happy to make a meal out of their french fries, guacamole, and beer.   So I recommend it for an outdoor happy hour if you can manage to get there early enough to enjoy it, otherwise there are a lot of good places at the same or less price in Old Town.",

Which turned out great because I am also a HUGE fan of themed places.  Carlsbad Tavern does a great job of celebrating New Mexico (and themselves) with a tongue-in-cheek flair without going too far into wackiness or kitsch.   My favorite drink is a Moscow Mule and they had several variations on their happy hour cocktail menu. Happy hour runs every day--not weekdays. We had to wait a bit to get service, but once we did it was very prompt.  The food was a bit sloppily presented and there were ants crawling all over my feet (we sat outside) so that is why this isn't a five star review.  But I am most definitely looking forward to going back!",

    "text": "Hidden gem alert! If you've ever driven on Hayden, traveled north from Thomas and passed by Carlsbad Tavern without stopping in, you're missing out! This is a charming little eatery complete with twinkle lights and a huge moat-like water fountain that surrounds the patio.   The atmosphere is casual and perfect for large groups. I celebrated a birthday here several years ago and have been for dinner several times. The interior is cozy and feels like you're truly in a cavern and the patio is charming with the sound of water while you eat under the twinkle lights. It's perfect for a casual but ambiance-filled date night, perfect if you have young children and need a place that allows noise and perfect for any sized group.   The food here is New Mexican and has a serious kick to it (in a good way). It appears that you must ask for salsa upon request. The salsa is very chunky and decent but the tomato chunks can make it hard to dip chips. The nachos are made with chipotle chips which is a nice change-up to typical nachos. Their go-to item is the Green Chile Burrito which is delicious. The combination of red and green sauce adds a kick and adds the perfect amount of \"mess\" to the meal. Anything here is good and the prices are reasonable so you can enjoy your meal without breaking the bank.",

The chicken wrap for lunch has great flavor, wish they offered this dish for dinner.   They don't advertise much and learning about the restaurant is sort of by word of mouth, but once I found it I keep coming back when visiting Scottsdale.  Good value and pleasant experience.",

    "text": "First time into Carlsbad Tavern. Shocking since I've lived in the valley for so long. Immediately coming into the lot there were no parking spots available, so I had to park across the street and walk over. Their atmosphere was quite interesting, I wish my friends had opted to sit on the patio rather than in the bar area.  Being there 2 hours we probably saw our server 5 or 6 times who only came by when drinks were empty already or someone new came to join. He also copped a little attitude when we needed to split the check so we separated everything for him. Am I wrong or do POS systems not have seat numbers on them? My flautas were OK and my margarita was awful but the rest of my party said the food was pretty good here most of the time, I suppose I'll have to come back and give it another shot.  One big pro though... When we left we realized there was a wait for tables. The atmosphere was so calm and people weren't crammed into the bar area while they waited. That is something they are definitely doing right. Stay posted for an updated review.",

Aside from a funky smell at the indoor bar everything was excellent. We sat out on the patio and enjoyed ourselves immensely.   3 stars just for being open and serving food until 2 am.   1 extra star for the steak quesadilla (recommended on yelp!) and the tacos and beans - all were beyond excellent.   The last star has to do with the drink order. One of our party can not handle sweetness in her drinks, so she asked for a margarita with Patron, just a squeeze of lime and salt. Not too sweet. The waitress responded with \"oh, basically a skinny rita? Sure\".  The other three of us ordered Skinny-ritas as well and a conversation before the drinks arrived braced us for disappointment - we all thought we would get four regular skinny ritas. But it didn't happen - three normal and one as requested made for the perfect start to a weekend visit.  Take away: Sometimes its the simple stuff - like getting a drink order right the first time. Everything was great.",

    "text": "We were looking for a decent Mexican restaurant to take out of town company to, near old town Scottsdale. This is New Mexican food rather than Mexican - but it was a perfect choice. We made a reservation for 7:30 on a Friday night, and I would recommend doing that  as we still had to wait a few minutes before a table was free.  It was a cold night, so we chose to sit inside, but we plan to return and sit outside on a warmer evening. There were plenty of people seated outside, under the propane heaters, even with outside temperatures in the 50s. We all ordered a house specialty, designated by a little bat on the menu (the cave/cavern theme is way overdone - but very charming nonetheless). We were all very happy with our food. I had the carne adovada that other yelpers have raved about and it was everything they promised. The portion size is very generous, so we had the leftovers for lunch today.  Our dinner bill was $65 for 4 full sized dinners - very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food.   The reason for the 4 star review is that we bought drinks in the bar while we were waiting for our table, and I was surprised by the cost of the margaritas. They were $9 each, and in a standard sized glass, that the bartender didn't even bother to fill to the top. He mixed them fresh for us, so that must be why it came up short, but for almost $20 for 2, he could have made a bit more.   Our waiter was great, too. I asked if the adovada was spicy and while he assured me it was not, he also offered to bring me a sample. I took him up on it.",

    "text": "I'm generally not one to leave reviews, but this restaurant was such a let down that I've decided I need to write more of them--I need to acknowledge the places that get it right. Carlsbad Tavern does not and is just, well, Bad.   I am a green chile fanatic and my wife is a big fan, and since we're visiting the southwest we went on a mission to find a great NM restaurant. Multiple locations on the internet pointed us to Carlsbad Tavern. Our meal:  1. Green chile corn queso dip: Not bad, just OK. Gloopy/thick without a ton of green chile flavor. Heavy.  2. Green chile mac bites: The panko had the most flavor after the ranch. No GC taste. If you want the same flavor with a quarter the calories, just dip a crouton in their chipotle ranch.  3. Salsas: Pretty dang good.  4. Blue Corn Enchiladas and the Enchantment mixed platter, both with GC. Most of the meats tasted absolutely bland, like they were braised in water. At least they were tender. The green chile sauce is literally the worst I've had anywhere--take a bag of roasted green chile, strain out the water, and then reduce them in a pan for 10 minutes. That's basically this sauce. Absolutely flavorless, but with a decent heat. The rice and beans were bland and forgettable. We joked about not wasting the calories and going to go get some tacos elsewhere.  We also had margaritas that were made differently by different bartenders. One of the four margaritas (mezcal margarita) was spectacular, but they couldn't seem to get the others right. The \"skinny\" margarita is supposed to be tequila, agave, and fresh lime juice, but I am 100% convinced either this is a pre-packaged mix or the \"fresh\" lime juice comes out of a little green plastic bottle shaped like a lime. \"Fresh\" margaritas aren't opaque yellow colored and tasting of citric acid zing. We've had 100's of fresh (real, not from a jar, including many homemade) margaritas and this is the first one we've complained to a server about. Instead of fixing the problem, the bartender came over and told us we were wrong. OK. We were even charged different amounts for the same margarita--at least the server corrected that one for us.   DO NOT come here if you're looking for solid green chile. If you're looking for milquetoast generic Mexican food and underwhelming margaritas, this is your jam. Patio is nice, though.",

When asked about the surf n' turf fajita special she said it looked really good.  Both were excellent!  Do this: go on a weeknight, sit in a bar booth, order the prickly pear margarita and the blue corn enchiladas. Assuming you don't have a shellfish or dairy allergy, you will not be disappointed!  The bat theme is a bonus, seriously fun for all ages.",

    "text": "Urggg, I hate it when I'm conflicted with being nice, especially when one of my friends knows the staff and owners, and being truthful, but I'm just not feeling Carlsbad Tavern enough to go more than 3/5 Stars.   I want to though, so I'm not writing this establishment off forever.  Screw it, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and change it. I'll add the extra star. Whatever. 4/5 Stars.  CARLSBAD TAVERN  Carlsbad Tavern was established in 1995. The New Mexican Bat Cave theme started at the original location on Scottsdale Road and Osborn with bats, Mexican Movie Posters and Roswell memorabilia.  However, upon the move to Hayden & Osborn in the Spring of 1998, the Bat Cave theme took on a new shape with the creation of the Guano Canal with a waterfall on the patio and the main dining room becoming The Bat Cave with a fountain.  After 11 years of adding to the decor, Carlsbad has been transformed into a place all ages can be comfortable in a multitude of different environments to suit the whole family.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  My girlfriend and I had just been to Postino Highland, which I love and previously reviewed (4/5 Stars) and we were supposed to meet some friends at Carlsbad Tavern.  When I arrived, I immediately fell in love with the entrance. I love the dramatic waterfall-moat thingy; it's very pretty.  The inside was dark, like too dark. It was hard to see what was going on, and it was mostly empty, with a few regulars at the bar. I guess that makes sense, since they call it \"The Batcave.\"  Like I said, my girlfriend knows the bartenders, and she ordered the drinks. I have no complaints about the service at all. Everyone was very friendly.  CONCLUSION  I'm not throwing in the towel to Carlsbad Tavern, it just didn't live up to the fun exterior and all the hype.  4/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *Plenty of parking out front. Valet available.  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcarlsbadtavern.com&s=e8bdc5cb4071e2076288ff4ff118117ceba30b145b9baef5aa5cc5d8c609256e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">carlsbadtavern.com</a>",

The drinks here are good and it's a nice spot to just meet with an old friend and talk. I always get the blue corn shrimp and chicken enchiladas. They are absolutely amazing and the flavor of the whole dish is spot on. One downside is you have to pay for your chips and salsa they don't come with your order. Plus side is the chips and salsa are fantastic and worth it. The food usually comes out really quickly as well!",

It is a spin off of the Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, as Mexican is their main cuisine.   We didn't eat the first time, but the drinks were great and the bartender were friendly and surely added to the experience.  Lastly, we went back for food today and we got the Mexican Potstickers. Thy were absolutely delicious!! We also got the Caverns Salad, but that wasn't the greatest personally just kinda a bland salad and wish the greens were mixed greens instead of just iceberg lettuce. Just wasn't what I was expecting and the flavor wasn't there. Made me think twice about getting food there.",

But then, you get there and actually taste the food and experience the slow service, and come to the conclusion that all those people who wrote reviews have never had good mexican food before in their lives. You can't really put the blame on them, can you? They've been deprived.  We ordered the carne asada tacos which were very disappointing. The waffle fries/nachos were also disappointing. I must say, the blue corn tortilla enchiladas were not that bad. So if you do happen to give this place a try, I suggest you stick to the enchiladas. The good news, is the valley does have plenty of other great Mexican spots for those of you who have been deprived. So don't give up hope, just yet.",

Every one of them had mixed reviews. If there were ten reviews with five stars there were two whining about something.  We chose the Carlsbad Tavern because there were good reviews about the food, great pictures, and the service sounded exceptional. The deciding factor was that the manager responded to almost every post. I hate writing these when I don't think anyone is reading them.  Several reviews raved about how wonderful a server Hannah was. After we were seated I asked my server if she was Hannah. She was not. I let her know that she had some mighty compelling Yelp reviews to surpass. Kristen did more that surpass them. She was pleasant, fast, attentive, helpful and above all smiling.  I promised to let this be known, and to clue everyone in that Hannah ain't got nothing on Kristen. Now, having not met Hannah, I will not assume that she is anything less than the reviews suggest. We look forward to returning, and giving her a run as well.  Oh, and the food was good as well. Definitely try the skinny margarita.",

Free chips and salsa when you check in   The bad- food is just lackluster. The small cup of salsa we ordered had quarter cuts of tomato in it. Everything else is just on the bland side.  Cocktails are pricy and overly sweet. Also majorly lacking on the alcohol. Take it from the worlds biggest lightweight, I felt nothing after my $9 drink.

It was busy, but we were able to grab a table outside. Our server was great.. he is from WI as am I. Our drinks came, our food came out. The food ended up being cold. The server came back to check on us, and I mentioned some of the food was quite cool. He apologized and took some of the food back . When he came back he told us they were comping out entire bill! There was a large party seated outside at the same time, and it caused a bit of a back up .  The team there really did go over and above we thought and we thanked them. The food did come back completely re prepared and wonderful as always. I can't say enough was the wonderful meal and service we had that day. There are not a lot of places out there that would do the same. Thanks Calrsbad Tavern! We will be back soon I'm sure!",

He didn't say hello, didn't even look at us as he continued his conversation. We waited.....and waited.....then finally we just walked away and sat ourselves.

I had been trying to plan my Mom's birthday party and instantly knew this would be the perfect location.  I spoke with the manager,  Tolan, who was SO SO accommodating to arrange a large group of people for my mothers birthday party. During the party, all the servers were SO on top of things, and never was there any confusion on how the bill was handled etc. Everything was perfect. I was impressed by that and the food enough that this is now our \"go to\" place for lunch",

Our new server Conner and his mentor Natalie were welcoming and accommodating.  The heat lamp was moved to accommodate the opposite side of the cozy fireplace. We requested outdoor seating.  Drink orders were promptly taken and recommendations made.  I always order the chili rellano, slightly crispy, accompanied by black beans and rice.  Everyone was pleased with their order.  Natalie asked us how Conner performed our service.  We were in agreement he earned his wings to serve solo.  As an Az Native, Carlsbad is often a dinner suggestion for visitors.  Best patio, fireplaces and waterfall.  Bravo!",

I was surprised as about everything in my experience was the opposite of what I'd read on yelp. The service was actually good. The bartender, I think his name was Louie, was very friendly. The food was mediocre at best; it kind of reminded me of airport Mexican food. The green chile isn't the same time of green chile I'm used to in Denver. This green chile was more like a salsa, not the stew/roux I've become familiar with in the southwest. My experience was fine, but not close to good enough to bother with Carlsbad again.",

They use Pecan wood in their grill which makes a big difference. Start off with some grilled Tequila Shrimp and some grilled Carlsbad Brochettes. A few of my favorites are the Machacha and Tomatillo Chimichanga, the Carne Adovada Plate, and the very spicy Habanero Burger. Menu reads \"Warning Hot! ... may cause temporary blindness or loss of hearing\". I thoroughly enjoyed it and was sweating like a dog. More napkins please. They have a large amount of choices on the menu including their NM spin on the Reuben Sandwich, the Philly Cheese Steak, and the Chicken Sandwich. Don't forget some desert to cool things down a bit. Carmel Flan covered with Prickly Pear or Chocolate Grand Marnier sauce or the decadent Chocolate Bread Pudding covered with Butterscotch sauce. Touchdown for the team!",

The staff has always been friendly here, and seating inside isn't bad either but it is really dark in there/ I can't pass up sitting on a good patio. This is a great spot for me because we live across the street so we can walk there or ride our bikes. The salsas that come with the chips & salsa are much tastier than your typical salsa (I like the green one) so I recommend getting those to munch on while you wait for your entrees. The Tesuque chicken salad is the bomb, the snapper tacos are really good, and the blue corn enchiladas were pretty good too. I want to try the Habenero burger next and I definitely want to go to brunch here one day. Two complaints are that the drinks on happy hour weren't cheap they were til like $7 (originally $9) and I wish it opened before 11am for brunch because I am usually up and hungry well before 11am which in turn, forces us to go elsewhere.",

Our server was very nice and energetic but super slow. I don't know what his name was and it took forever to put our order in! Was it busy? No. It got pretty annoying because my 18 month old is FAR FROM patient. Oh well, she got back at slow service with the beautiful mess she left under her chair :) None of their salads sounded good, but I'm picky with dressings. I'm sure they're great. I could have eaten burgers and fries but I'm really trying to eat healthy! SOOO I got a cup of soup and it was overpriced and wasn't \"stop the presses\" fantastic. My bad. My husband got the \"Green Chili Philly\" and that was friggin' GREAT! I should have ignored my diet for one meal.  My daughter had chicken fingers and fries and those were also great! (Yes, I nibbled on a few).  Lesson learned? Do NOT go here for soup :) All in all, it was OK.",

The decor inside was like a fun sports bar or Texas steakhouse restaurant, minus the peanut shells. Our waiter was nice and attentive.  We both ordered the Manchaca and tomatillo chimichanga.  Generally, I don't tend to order beef at any restaurant, except for the occasional Wendy's hamburger (I just love those square patties!).  The shredded beef was absolutely delicious.  The chimichanga was also served with rice and beans, which were fine, but the main dish stood out on its own.  If I am back in town and Carlsbad Tavern is still open, I will definitely come back.",

Lots of variety for a Mexican Restaurant. The dishes are inventive and there are so many that I wished I could have tried. All the portions are fairly generous.  The Osso Buco that I had was excellent. The sauce and potatoes it came with were also very good.  For lunch I had the award winning Habanero Burger. It wasn't cooked as I had ordered. They cooked it well and I asked for medium. However, it was still very good and the fries are excellent. The only downside was that the fresh chopped Habanero is not very much fun a few hours later when it's on its way out.  I really want to go back and try more of the varied fair.

    "text": "We've been to Carlsbad a number of times. The location is great and the nachos are fantastic. However, let me explain why we won't be going back: 1. The service is atrocious. We have gone in groups of 15 and as a couple and either way, the service sucks. I understand when there is a big group that service will be slower, but not bringing in 2 servers for extra large groups is just dumb. We ordered HALF the beers we could have because our server was never around! The food orders have taken 20-40 minutes! It's just insane. This is also when the restaurant does not appear busy.  2. The manager was a jerk. He mocked my husband and insulted some of our friends.   3. I personally would prefer to see some \"lighter\" options on the menu. There are 3 or 4 salads and that's about it. If you don't want a salad, then you better not be on a diet.   Overall, we are disappointed with the service. I don't go out often, but when I do I expect better.",

I did for years...just wondering about the name and thinking that I needed to try it.  Then, a way long time back..I took a friend there for dinner.  What a blast!  Not sure what time of year but a perfect weather to dine alfresco.  So we sat outside and the hours fairly cruised by as we ate from one end of the menu to the other.  The food was pretty good too!  Everything we tried tasted great. I think!  The drinks were good..I can swear to that.  So a few months go by and I try it again.  Second verse, same as the first!  The food was good, the service was good!  Anyhow, in the intervening years, CT has never failed me. For me, it has always been kind of a fun place to take someone who has never been there.  The outside gives no indication of how cool the interior is.  I will keep heading back and recommend it pretty highly!",

Outside on the patio they have a pretty \"stream/mote\" whatever you want to call it, with the misters a great combo. The menus are on newspaper that looks like its out of a western which is cute.  My favorite dish is the chicken fried steak, it's delicious! As far as an appetizer the skewers are good with mean and veggies. My favorite, and most unhealthy, green chili mac and cheese. Yum!   I have been 3 times and each time service has been slow. That and the inside being dark are my only complaints.   Other than that this is a great place for happy hour or to grab some dinner with friends/family. One out of the three was a date and I wasn't impressed for a first date.",

Our waiter asked us if we wanted a drinks. Not wanting any originally, we decided to get a margarita and Moscow mule. We ordered three chicken tacos and the blue corn enchiladas. After about ten minutes, he asked us what our order of food was. We repeated the order back to him. 20 minutes go by and we are asked if we need more drinks. \"During the waiting he sat at our table to talk about he world series game.\" Another 20 minutes go by and we are asked again if we need more drinks. Finally we ask if we have food coming after watching all the tables around us get served their order. He says yes we do. 5 minutes later he comes back and tells us the kitchen lost our order and he doesn't remember what we ordered from him at all. He couldn't remember the two simple things we ordered twice!!!Disgrace to the food industry. We left at 11:10 pm. Hungry to say the least! Never seen anything like it before in my life.",

    "text": "Being from New Mexico and missing the food something fierce...made me want to not like this place.    I have to tell you, it is not like the food back home.  No matter how hard anyone tries...New Mexico is hard to replicate.    Thanks to Yelp, we got some free chips and salsa.  The red salsa is very chunky and can be difficult to scoop out of the little bowl with the chips...tasty and could use a bit more jalapeno in my opinion....sorry I love hot chile!  There is also a green/tomatillo salsa that is also very yummy!    I couldn't decide what to try..a green chile cheeseburger or one of their brunch offerings.  As I perused the menu, I noticed that it does have more of the northern New Mexico feel to it rather than the souther NM food I am used to. I opted for the brunch offering.   I can tell you it is very rare to find dishes served with black beans in southern NM, but theirs were tasty...a bit on the salty side.  They were served on the side of the Carlsbad Benedict...a very spicy and unique take on some Eggs Benedict. I opted for them to be served with carne adobada.  Very different from how it is back home, but very tender and spicy nonetheless.  Here, they prepare it as shredded beef marinated and saucy, where I am used to it being more of a steak that is in a drier rub type of seasoning.  Again, I really did enjoy this take on carne adobada.   The eggs were poached perfectly and I absolutely LOVED the jalapeno hollandaise sauce that finished off this dish.    I wasn't thrilled with the fried potatoes that were served on the side.  They looked and tasted as if they had been sitting there for a while.  Not fresh at all.    The kicker...in a good way...was the build your own Bloody Mary bar.  For $3.75, I was given a very generous serving of vodka and made my way over to the little table.  There was a wide range of offerings or \"accoutrements\" for your custom bloody mary!  From pickled asparagus, seasoned and marinated jicama (MY FAVORITE), olives, pepperonccinis, pickles, a ton of hot sauces, tomato juice, clamato, V8, and even fresh horseradish!  I'm sure there was more, but I couldn't fit anything else into my glass!  I must say, I make a mean bloody mary!  For the price, you can't go wrong!  I look forward to going back and trying their large menu!  It is a cool place and I'm sure it gets packed during football season for the early opening for the early games...early! ;-)",

    "text": "I'm sorely disappointed considering the many good reviews of this place. Plus the fact that it is open late and so conveniently located to where we live. My family and I decided to try it out for the first time on July 4th for a late, late lunch.  THE PLACE: I love that they have a water display as you come into the restaurant. If you decide to sit by the patio area, you also get to experience the relaxing sound of water. The inside, is pretty uniquely decorated and we sat by a wall made to appear like a bat cave.  THE SERVICE: Friendly reception and our server, was super hyper and eager to assist. For sure, we never ran out of beverage. He also addressed any questions we had about the menu, as it was our first time.  THE FOOD: Oiy Vey, let's start with the good. My daughter had a simple cheeseburger. It was okay, and the fries were deliciously crispy and not oily... sadly the good ends there for us.  First, we had chips and salsa, which does not come free. The chips were nicely spiced, which would have been terrific, if they weren't stale. We can tell they were re-heated somehow as the basket it came in was warm.  But there is no masking a stale chip.  The red and green salsas in came with were pretty good though.  My hubby had the new item on the menu, Pork Tomatillo Burrito. The burrito itself was okay, the bad part was the red rice. It was so obviously old. You can taste it especially after they had to reheat and top it with cheese. The rice on my Carne Adovada Plate was just as bad.  My Carne Adovada, I had no complaints on the serving size considering price. But it just tasted off, like it has been sitting for awhile. I know it takes awhile to cook, but this just tasted old :(  Maybe it was an off day for the resto, but I'm afraid once is enough for me and don't currently plan on trying the place again.",

(This is one of the items that didn't have peppers.) even the guacamole has to many peppers. Strangely enough the salsa are too bland. Go figure. By far the best thing on the menu is the Caramel flan. Make sure you ask for the sauce on the side. Another plus, the service was very good.",

The staff here are all incredibly friendly. It looked like they actually enjoyed working there. And you can tell this place is family owned. It has a certain fun factor that corporate lawyers would most likely have advised against (examples being...the giant waterfall, outdoor canal, and large objects hanging tenuously from the ceiling).   The food was pretty good. My dining companions complained of too much cheese, but this is \"New Mexico\" style Mexican food. What better way to \"Americanize\" something than to put giant portions of cheese all over it. Am I the only one who occasionally has a craving for a giant burrito covered in savory green chili sauce and melted monterrey jack?  As soon as I hear those magic words \"be careful,the plate is REALLY hot!\" I turn into a human version of Pavlov's dog.   The margaritas were very good, and their tomatillo salsa was top notch.",

This was one of our \"bitch about work\" spots so we pretty much just stuck to drinks, chips & salsa and maybe a Quesadilla here and there.    But still - I really like the place!  The set up in the bar is awesome, with kinda U shaped high back booths that allow you to squeeze in quite a crowd - and only the folks on the end really see anyone else in the place. Great for a girls night or if you just have obnoxious friends - and don't we all have at least a few?  The bar itself is really cool.  I love the look of it - very cave like.  What I really want to come back for though is their outdoor patio.  Huge area with tables and chairs all around and a great moat/fountain/waterfall out there.  While we all know this was totally man-made of course, it has a great \"hanging outdoors\" feeling.  Which of course you are outdoors... but.... well....crap.  It's like your \"outside\" vs. in a parking lot or a cement slab.  You know where I'm going here, right?  Anyhow, it's a good time, if your just hanging out with a frosty beverage or, apparently based on other reviews, to eat.",

This place has a one of the nicest patios around. I would recommend to this place to anyone wanting to have a great meal in a fun atmosphere!",

To begin, I don't even know how this place has 4 stars and falls under \"Mexican food.\" I arrived at this place under the False pretense  that I could get some decent Mexican food. How wrong I was. First, I thought we would receive chips and salsa when the water came out, but I was wrong that would be at an additional $3. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with red sauce. While you would think this would be an easy ask it seemed to be very difficult to do. While the server was very nice in getting this done the burrito was HORRIBLE! The beans tasted as if they were thrown from the can to the stove for about 2 min and then out to us. The rice was crunchy and did not taste like regular spanish rice. Needless to say I will not be back for Mexican food.",

The overall feel of the restaurant is very kitschy, which I'm not opposed to if done right, but Carlsbad's ambiance is kinda like a ride at Disney World that hasn't been updated since the early 90s.  The food was just okay. The chicken in my salad almost tasted like pressed chicken you'd find in a fast food sandwich (I'm guessing it wasn't, but the flavor wasn't much better). Overall, the food is on the spicier side, which I typically can handle, but perhaps I'm just not a green chili fan, because here...you have to be.",

    "text": "So after a most mediocre meal last night I'm still wondering how this place is so positively Yelped? Please don't get me wrong.. CT is a great hang out and is VERY well priced with huge portions but, quality over quantity is a sound rule that for my experience didn't hold True.   We sat for about 15 minutes before we're even acknowledged by our waiter.. I was so thirsty I almost took my chances and drank from the pool on the patio.. who knows what was in that water but I was SO ready to find out when our waiter showed. Once we got moving the service was decent though one of the entrees was nearly 10 behinds behind the rest. So of course we waited for that entree to come out while ours got cold so we could eat together. Pretty annoying though forgivable I suppose. What wasn't forgivable were the screaming kids that were playing around the pool as their stupid parents sat there and got drunk. How can you enjoy a meal when there are babies crying and children playing.. it seemed like fucking Romper Room instead of a TAVERN! *Sigh* I miss Lambchop!  The food.. eh.. so so. The Pork Adovada sauce was bitter to the point of needing to drown it in sour cream to take the edge off. Me personally would have sent it back but there were other powers that be. The Rotisserie Chicken wasn't better then something you can get at your local grocery, though Id have to say that the groceries are far more moist and flavorful. There were 2 standouts.. Habaero Cheeseburger and the Green Chile Mac 'n Cheese.. both very very tasty!   We will certainly come back here from time to time but there are other old reliables that make better New Mexican food in Scottsdale.",

I did not recognize more than 1 face ( a younger guy server). My boyfriend and I walked in to ask for dining for 2. There was an older lady as a hostess maybe in her 50s. She said one table left. I kindly asked okay no booths by chance when I saw several open. She repeated herself verbatim but so rudely \"One table left.\"  I look at her confused by her tone. She sat us in the back and our serve has 4 tables from what I saw. She was nothing extraordinary with her customer service. I asked for my usual filet minon quesadilla. She said I think that's only for happy hour. Walked away 10 feet to another server and came back saying yeah we can't do that. Now keep in mind I have been there for years different days a week different times. Happy hour and non happy hour. They have never refused to make it. I ordered tacos and the server rushes us to pick. Food came out & food was bland and so disappointing. I tip over 20 percent and am not super picky. But rude hostess, unwilling staff, awful food. Used to love this place. Never going back. I read all the recent reviews since new owner. Sorry carlsbad but you lost your oldtown rating to me",

From the road, it looks like any establishment, but as soon as you get to the entrance, it's like you're walking on the set of Pirates of the Carribean! It was really cool. The outside patio was designed to look like a beach front dock with a lagoon. There are two fireplaces on the lower patio with a bar in the middle. And then seating on a deck on the outside of the bar. Inside there is a bar and also high backed booths to fit two or four people. The ambiance of this place is unlike any place I've been to before. (note...I'm new to the valley!). The service was fast and courteous and the drinks strong! There's room for large groups outside and it's a very festive crowd. I'm going back there this Saturday for drinks with friends and encourage you to go too.   I haven't eaten there yet, so I can only give the place four stars, but I loved this place.

I was basically judging a book by it's cover, which is so stupid because this place is AWESOME!  First of all, you have to sit outside.  Their outdoor area is fantastic and doesn't make you feel like Hayden Rd. is on the other side of the rock wall.  I really wanted some Mexican-style food, which is why my boyfriend and I went to Carlsbad in the first place.  We saw the habenero burger and quickly changed our minds to challenge the heat of the burger.  We also got a side of the green chile mac, which complemented the spiciness quite well.  The burger has a warning saying \"you buy it, you own it,\" and although I thought the burger was excellent, I didn't think it was all that hot or scary.  Don't get me wrong, it was definitely hot, but nothing the average heat-lover couldn't handle.  I love it when you find a place that has so many things you want to try, and Carlsbad is one of them.  I am looking forward to going back and getting something new, oh and having another one of their house margs which are also great!",

The salsa now tastes like it comes straight from a can and there was such a huge layer of grease on my food that I couldn't figure out where my enchiladas stopped and the beans started.  Last night I went there with my mom and Grandma and the waitress was a huge snob, we didn't even want to tip her (of course we did).  It was so dark in the dining room that my grandma couldn't see the menu so she asked if they had a shredded beef burro. The waitress, in a condescending voice says, \"Yes, of course we do, what you want is a green chili burro\".   Gma then asked if that was spicy and she said, \"Not really\".  It came out so spicy that she couldn't even eat it.  The waitress did not offer to make her something else or take if off the bill, she was sooooo rude the entire meal, I won't even write about all the instances.  Her name was Michelle, so if you go there and she's your server you may as well get up and leave.   I really want to like Carlsbad, its within walking distance from my house and has a good concept... I just don't know if I can go back after my experience last night.",

I had to go all out and try the enchantment platter which consisted of chili releanos, a blue avodaba burrito, and tamale ...to top it off delicious red and green sauce covered the delectables as well as melted cheese mmm, with tasty black beans on the side  ....the highlight of the evening had to have been when my dad, new to places reviewed by yelp was in awe of his chimichanga and had proclaimed it was by far the best he had ever had!!! what a night :D",

I love spicy food, and the habanero burger caught my eye right away. The burger was delicious, the meat was well prepared. The only thing I was disappointed about was that it was not as hot as I expected, I have tried quite a few spicy burgers in my day. The fries and salad were excellent as well. My family members had cheese crisps and quesadillas, to which there were no complaints. I did not order a beverage from the bar, but it looked very spacious with a wide selection. The restaurant also features a good sized patio setting near a pleasant moat. Service was average, nothing special but no complaints.",

It was BIG, and full of chicken and green chiles.  Salad was wonderful with the house jalapeno ranch dressing.  I had a great chardonnay and a great time.

The complimentary chips and salsa were good; the salsa did have some kick to it. Our meals, however, were very lame. I had the blue corn enchiladas - one chicken, one shrimp - and honest to goodness, the \"meat\" had no discernible flavor. Not only could I not tell which was which, but couldn't identify a particular meat flavor at all; the ingredient was totally without flavor. My husband ordered the chile rellenos which he reported also lacked any discernible flavor; he said the only thing that had any flavor was the cheese. For dessert we had the sopapillas. No flavor there either! Granted, the meal was only $37 for two entrees, three sopapillas and two house margaritas (good flavor, verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry little alcohol). We were not inspired enough to go back. Bummer. Not a place for foodies.",

For our table there was one umbrella and the sun, if directly on you was hot! We had to gather umbrellas and position them ourselves..it was quite a comotion. Our server even saw this and didnt even offer to assist!  The server, didnt seem to care about the service, after all the 18% was already included.  It took forever to get our drink orders and even longer if we wanted to partake in the bloody Mary Bar.. because he had to bring us glasses.  The Bloody Mary Bar, was on a teeny tiny filthy table next to the bar...the garnishes were extinct, the table was dripping various ingredients. It looked like the remnants of a rager the night before. One of my friends asked for an olive, since none were provided and the bartender (who wasn't busy) rolled her eyes and scoffed! WTF?  I have to say the food was good.. at least the lobster croissant was but it wasn't worth coming back with all things considered,",

This was my first visit to Carlsbad Tavern, and it will not be my last.  I went with a house salad and will agree with Rick S in recommending it with their jalapeno ranch dressing.  Either it was really good or I was really hungry, but I digress!  For my entree, the lobster enchiladas were completely satisfying - especially once they brought out a side of guacamole per my request.  Jared had the carne adovada plate.  (I guess he gets that every f-in time he goes there; i don't think he's ever had anything else!  Guess he likes it!)  No desserts or drinks this visit, but I'm sure we'll be back for more... although the mints on the way out were great!  (And for those curious about the price, our bill was $36 before tip).  We noticed they serve a Sunday Brunch - Bloody Mary Bar as well... sounds good to me; especially once we move to Old Town and won't have to worry about drinking and driving!  Friendly attentive service at the bar, and many more menu items I am excited to try.  Until next visit, Carlsbad Tavern...",

We got to the parking lot and I must say, I was immediately turned off. Cheesy decor outside and even cheesier decor on the inside. It smelled like if they just cleaned the place down, so I couldn't smell any food, only flowers and botanical junk. We decided to stay anyway. The menu wasn't appealing at all, but maybe it was because I was already turned off. I ordered the fajita quesadilla (i think that's what it was called) and the Tequila shrimp. To my surprise they were both very very good. Very well seasoned for both dishes.  I had also tried the house made sangria. Skip it, it tastes like hawaiian punch. Way too sweet. All in all, the food we had was good. If you are in the neighborhood and your expectations are not high go ahead and try it. But if your dining experience includes decor and ambience, then go somewhere else.",

Inside was a little dark and I guess it was all the bats around but it reminded me of \"Dusk Till Dawn\".   We were seated, I hope was hoping for chips and salsa, I guess they don't serve them here?  We weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary.   Anyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics)  There is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get.  For $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon.  There was more garnish on the plate than anything. Other than that it was good.   My Friend ordered the Green Chile Stew and The Green Chile Mac and Cheese (see pics) She has been here before so knew what she liked. I tasted the macaroni and thought it was pretty good too.

During our visit the owner's adorable 4 year old daughter was holding court at one of the tables.  We ordered some nachos and a couple of pollo burritos. The nachos were only half good- the top half. The owner/cook didn't drain one of the nacho components properly so there was a bunch of water at the bottom of the platter, rendering the bottom tortilla chips to mush.  The chicken in the  burrito was under spiced but with the addition of the salsa verde and their zippier chipotle salsa it made the spice level just fine. I also didn't understand the addition of the lettuce in the burrito. If I am not mistaken, isn't an authentic Mexican burrito just the meat and beans and/ or rice? Maybe that is an east coast rendition that I 'm not familiar with.  Overall, a decent place to pick up cheap, fresh food.",

But, I just stood my ground and told them how great this place was and that they would like it. We made a reservation for 9 for the outside area. The guys were all late, figures.

They offer smoking and non-smoking on separate sides of the patio.  Of course you know that if anyone is smoking, the entire area gets to \"enjoy\" the smoke.  Being a non-smoker, I would appreciate an True non-smoking area but being outdoors was too compelling to pass on this beautiful day.  Another small observation - the tables were too low for the chairs causing you to lean over to eat and the chairs were not comfortable at all.    We ordered chicken quesadilla & crab cake appetizer.  The quesadilla was made w/ green chiles and cheese, served w/ green & red salsa.  Didn't care for the red salsa but the green was pretty good, rather mild.  A side of sour cream was all that was missing here.  Crab cakes were ok, nothing special.  Served w/ a nice side salad it made a very good small meal.  A side of some kind of orange sauce (chipotle?) for the crab cakes that seemed really HOT to me - skip this next time please.  Just based on the outdoor atmosphere alone, I would definitely come back again.",

Good local beers on tap and they are very friendly to Spring training baseball goers! Great service and open late! After 10pm they have a late night menu, which still has a great selection that will fill you up! Highly recommended.",

Believe me, don't need the song and dance, but when your table is clearly celebrating something, it seems like the polite thing to do to just say \"happy birthday\".  Was a great day to sit on the patio, fountains were fountain-ing, and psrking's plentiflu/easy.  Two of us had the Carl's Chicken Sandwich, which had a bunch of good flavors. Side salad was nicely put together and not just iceberg lettuce. The third person had the Southwest Patty Melt with fries--also very good. The tangerine margarita wasn't too bad. Prices vary between steep and reasonable.  Will we go back? Meh...",

It's not a matter or free food but principle. First time ever my yelp offer was not honored. Not returning again as I don't believe the yelp reviews or yelpers are valued.  Disappointed !!",

Though on second thought, the waterfall and moat was pretty cool.  In case a medieval army decides to attack I guess.  There's a nice little patio to the side, but I chose to sit at the bar to people watch - \"Hungry Eyes\"!  I ordered the Green Chile Burrito and boy was is massive.  However, I couldn't believe I ate the whole thing!  YOU, get in my belly!  Felt like mini-me was in my belly!  ooof!  It was definitely well worth it.  The chile was tasty and the black beans were well spiced.  The shredded beef inside the burrito with the chiles were to die for - mmmmm!  I pounded it down with a few drinks.  Gluttony!  Now I just gotta look our for Kevin Spacey! (SE7EN reference!)   Service was good, I think the waiter kept pushing drinks on us haha!  Do I look like I need another one!  Well yes, yes I do.

    "text": "I have no idea how this place has 4 stars on here. To begin with, I think the outside of the restaurant sets False expectations as to what you shall find once on the inside. The entrance of the restaurant is delightful with a beautiful patio, running waters, a mini lake/river, romantically lit up at night making it look like you are about to enter into a devine culinary experience. Once on the inside, the restaurant is dark and dingy, divided into two parts: a bar area with enormous booths, and a dinky room with fake wildlife where more booths and tables are. We were lucky enough to sit by the dinky wildlife/fake mountainside/faux cave where there were still last years halloween decorations up. My personal favorite was the bats. And to top it all off, it was incredibly dark in there, adding to the dark and dingy halloween theme they have going on.  If the ambience isnt enough to kill your appetite, the food sure is. We got two entrees: steak tacos (from the appetizers section) and a trio platter (one of the supposed \"favorites\" according to the trippy waiter) with the chile rellenos, enchilada, and burrito. Lets start with the steak tacos: personally I think Taco bell tacos are superior to what I ate. The steak inside was cold. On to the platter: first of all you could not physically distinguish which was which without the help of the waiter pointing out each item due to the amount of sauce on top of the whole dish. Better yet, my taste buds couldn't distinguish the difference between each dish because it all just tasted like generic mexican flavored mush.  Usually yelp reviews and star ratings are really legit, don't know how this one has escaped that. You're better at off at Taco Bell.",

We ordered a chicken quesadilla and 4 bowls of soup to split between 4 of us. The chicken inside of the quesadilla was cold and the soup was luke warm. When I told our server he told me it was probably because of the sour cream and walked away. He returned with some other food and with attitude offered to \"throw my soup in the microwave\". I declined that offer. He left the table and came back to let us know they had a fresh batch of soup that was boiling hot and they would replace our soups. They brought the fresh soup and only 1 had sour cream in it. I asked for sour cream in the others and he told me there was sour cream in all of them. But there was not. Again, attitude. I asked for the manager. The server came back with the big stainless steel bin with sour cream from the kitchen and plopped it into each of our soups (awkward and with attitude). Manager came over and agreed with server that sour cream was in all soups and didn't really comment on the servers attitude at first. Then he said he would talk to him. We pointed out the burned hamburger bun for a kids meal on the other side of the table and he agreed it was burnt and said he would talk to the kitchen about it. No offer to replace it. We were NOT being high maintenance only asking for what we ordered to be cooked and served properly. The server never apologized and we were charged for every item on our bill. We tipped 10% only because I feel a tip is part of the deal on eating out. I am sad to say I will never go back.",

So many things on the menu I love.    One of my favorites is the lobster croissant.  Its so amazing.  And I love their side salad with house dressing instead of fries.  Not to say the fries are bad, they are good, but they have one of the better side salads with the jalapeno ranch dressing.  They have an awesome chimichanga if i am in the mood for something heavier.  I haven't had anything on the menu that I dislike, and  i have nearly tried all.  Their specials are always excellent.  The other thing I love is the atmosphere.  Outside is great, inside at the bar or inside the bat cave is cool.  They always seem to be playing 80s pop wave music which always cheers me up.  I am a fan of the 80s! Everything about this place is great.",

The dinner plate was loaded with so much cheese you could choke from it... unhealthy and fattening meal, and unfortunately the taste, quality of food, or flavor did not justify the calories.   The atmosphere is very nice, unfortunately the food made it such that I'll never return.  Service was good overall.  The manager walked over to ask us how we were doing, but didn't stay long enough to hear the answer.  Enjoyed the 80's alternative music.",

For our meal, I ordered the Green Chili Open-Face Burger with a side salad with jalapeno ranch. I typically order ground beef well done, and this was no exception. Unfortunately, the burger I received was cooked to medium. I didn't notice at first because we were seated on the dark patio, and the string lights above us were burnt out, so we couldn't see our food. It was evening, and another waiter went around to light the candles on the tables, but I guess he forgot ours. Our waitress was unattentive, and my husband had to ask the food runner for water. When the waitress did finally acknowledge us, she apologized for not getting us more water, and then told me that my burger was probably undercooked because the stove doesn't work well. Good to know. Anyway, I'm just not sure I want to return. I came here a few years back, and the waiter forgot to put in my order until all the other people in my party were served. Unfortunately, the service here needs improvement, and though I like the food (for the most part), the service is bad enough for me to spend my money elsewhere.",

    "text": "A great late night spot when you're looking to stay out of Old Town, but not a place that I would make it a point to dine at otherwise.  For several years, \"The Bat Cave\" has been our late night stops after concerts, shows, etc. as they have a slightly abbreviated menu, but still offer many of their New Mexican dishes and drinks at a reasonable price.  The crab cakes are a great appetizer and are served on a bed of fresh greens with a very spicy habanero aioli.  My favorite entree is the green chile carne adovada burrito, of which I've also had a vegetarian version.  The carne adovada plate is good too since the meat is typically quite spicy, however, on occasion it can have some dry, leathery chunks of meat that seem like they've been severely overcooked.  In fact, there were a few times that I probably looked like a member of the Griswold family as they were trying to gnaw on the overcooked turkey at Christmas dinner (come on, everyone knows that scene!).  The enchiladas (one chicken, one shrimp) are so-so as there really isn't much spice involved and they tend to be oily and heaped with cheese.  The food always comes out quickly, but the service in general is slow as we normally have to flag down a server passing by to get another round of drinks and the bartenders seem to be moving in slow motion when making a drink or opening a bottle of beer.  The atmosphere is unique (I said unique, not upscale or even overly clean) and the outdoor patio offers a nice waterfall for scenery.  They do at least make an attempt to segregate smokers onto one side of the divided patio so there is some chance that people can enjoy the patio without shortening their lifespan, but wind direction plays a critical role here.  If you set your expectations correctly, this place has some redeeming qualities and is worth stopping in to at least try it out.",

I got the Carne Adovada plate and man was it good. The spiciness level was perfect and just enough to clear the sinuses. The flavor was full and complex. The rice and beans were solid (this is usually my indicator of good Mexican cuisine) but not anything so delicious that I felt compelled to eat them all. The decorations were really cool and I liked how the menu was like a newspaper.

Our server was prompt and attentive but she was of the old school diner waitress type...all business, no smile but gets it done! We never had to ask for beverage refills because she was two steps ahead.   My friend and I are both gluten free and after a recommendation from the aforementioned waitress we opted for two of the tex-mex specialities; the blue corn enchiladas and the stacked enchiladas. Food was delivered fast and we also got free chips and two types of salsa for checking in on Yelp (sweet!).  We both enjoyed our meals thoroughly. The food was tasty, piping hot, and portions were large enough for a doggy bag. Just beware that the plates the entrees are served on we're scorching hot! I mean like burn your fingers hot, they really should do something about that because it could be a safety issue.   So everything was fabulous except the random drunk man. Several times while trying to enjoy our meal this drunk patron stumbled over to our table and blew kisses, winked, stared mumbled some nonsense, and very loudly belched at us. On his last trip over he actually sat down at our both on top of my friends take-out box! Not our waitress but another server saw this go down and apologized and made him leave. She told us he had been doing this all night to various other customers. Ok, so here's the deal. Great that you handled it BUT why did it get this far??? Why did the bartender (who only had two other patrons) keep serving this man? Why didn't anyone call him a cab? Why didn't the manger intervene? Why did this poor girl have to be the one to deal with his drunkeness? So, while the food and service were both great that man did impede on our evening to the point we were worried about leaving for fear he was roaming the parking lot, luckily he wasn't.",

We arrived at 4:30pm on a Saturday and had our pick of the seating. Fantastic, cozy atmosphere in the dining room. Our waitress was fast and courteous--really, perfect service. I used the Yelp check-in to get the free chips and salsa. Delicious stuff--loved both salsas.  Since it was happy hour time, we order ala carte as a family: brochettes, grilled chicken quesadilla, habanero sliders,and New Mexican potstickers. The brochettes were primarily mine and they were awesome. Going back, I'd make that a meal all by itself. The chicken quesadilla was delicious, though the bottom was very crunchy and required the steak knife to cut through. The potstickers were great and not hot-hot but good flavor. I didn't sample the sliders because I can't handle the heat, but my husband loved those and the fries.  For dessert, we split the chocolate bread pudding as part of my Bread Pudding Quest. This was a solid entrant. The texture was perfect and the chocolate flavor in the bread was just right. I'm not crazy about butterscotch but it worked well here to add moisture and a touch of sweetness. It's not my favorite bread pudding but it's very good and I recommend it if you're a chocolaholic.   I'm pretty sure next time we come here--and there will be a next time--my husband is determined we try the sopas.",

    "text": "Love this place. Surprised I haven't reviewed it already. I would say this is in my top few places to take visitors. You have the fountain, the bat cave thing going on, the outside seating around the water, and awesome food on top. Inside, you feel  like you are in an old lodge, adorned with license plates, memorabilia, fun things to ogle at while you swallow beer. Lots of beer. Because its great for drinking. The bartender is on top of things.   No wings here, unless you order the BBQ chicken, which I did. I order this most often when I go after breakfast. They make a spicy sauce and roast a half chicken to perfection, served with slaw and mac and cheese sides. The mac and cheese is a SW style, try it. Yummy to the bottom. You can order a whole bowl if you are carb-loading.  I have tried many other things, they have really good burgers, many with a SW feel.  If you really want a treat, come for breakfast where they make these twisted benedicts and burritos that look like they came off a magazine cover. You will always bring food home and always have a nice time because, well. because there is lots of beer here. Fun, fun place.",

My stomach always hurts afterwards and I never knew why but it was always worth it so I never asked questions. Come to find out their rice is made with chicken stock (which is normal) but she was the first waitress to tell me that without my mentioning being a 13 year vegetarian. She said she had a hunch and thought she should tell me beforehand. Now I know! Their rice is amazing, by the way. Just don't get it if you're a veggie. Or do and deal with the stomach ache because it's worth it, hah. Anyway, it was so thoughtful of her to proactively mention that. The veggie enchaladas are absolutely amazing and so is the green chili mac and cheese that I got. Drinks-wise I got the Miracle on Hayden and asked for the jalapeno to be added. Amazing. I love it here!",

Looking over the happy hour menu we decided on the chicken quesadilla and the New Mexican pot stickers with green salsa. The green salsa is definitely a must try as it's quite different than what I'm used to. I can definitely see the pot stickers being very popular after trying it.  It was nice to be able to sit outside and I loved the atmosphere. It's a great place to gather with friends and family. The service here is great and they make sure that you have a pleasant dining experience.",

Mainly because I was young and dumb and had no idea that there was a Carlsbad in New Mexico (my heart & brain was sooo naive) and couldn't figure out the bats inside the restaurant (fake bats everyone, no bats were harmed while doing this review). But the first taste of the chips and salsa I didn't care where this place was, I just knew I needed this and couldn't wait for my meal.   Fast forward 8 or so years, I still have the same excitement when I go. But now know there's a place in New Mexico with amazing the flavours, hence the hatched green chilies. The food is still just as decadent as my first time. I would lick the plate if people wouldn't judge me on that. But that's just how good this place is! My goal is to make it there for brunch and do my happy food dance when it's in front of me.   This is such a nice and relaxing spot for fun, dates or to just sit in the bar and talk with the people around you. You can't go wrong with the food, the customer service or the ambiance.",

Met our party, who were already seated, at 5:50 and the waiter came by the table at 6:02 to see if we needed anything. Happy hour ended at 6pm so that was a bummer. Please come to the table before happy hour is over!  Our kid ordered a kids cheeseburger with spicy cheese  instead of American. The waiter was nice and recommended it.  The cheeseburger came out as 2 sliders and the cheese was wrong. Our kid took a bite and realized this so the waiter ok the sliders back to \"remake\".  He came back with the same sliders, bite out of one and all, with the new cheese on it. Guessing they scrapped off old cheese, put on new cheese and then microwaved?  The meat was over cooked as well, but they did replace the bun with a bite in it. To top it off they charged us 1.25 on top of it.   There was a nice gal (wearing a lighter shirt) that was buzzing around checking in on tables through the night.She was very friendly and truly seemed to care about the guests.",

    "text": "This is a really cool place! I first visited here probably 15 years ago back when I lived in Scottsdale. I remember ordering and loving their stacked enchiladas for late night happy hour. Carlsbad Tavern opened in the mid-90's with a New Mexican theme that pays homage to Carlsbad Caverns Park. I have always loved its cave theme and have wanted to pay a return visit for years. I went out for Valentine's Day recently and they were able to squeeze me in last minute (much appreciated!). The outside of the restaurant is very unique and beautiful. They have a mini waterfall, a bridge that crosses over a little canal and plenty of shaded outdoor seating. The inside is like being in a cave with lots of bat decor and memorabilia that reflects New Mexican culture. Family owned for many years, Carlsbad Tavern serves up delicious New Mexican cuisine. I started off with their Green Chile Stew. It was nice and thick with a hint of spiciness. For entrees, I had their popular Carne Adovada and my date had the Chimayo Chicken. I can see why the Carne Adovada has been such a signature dish for years. The meat is slow-roasted and nice and tender. But what we were most excited for was their basket of sopapillas for dessert. I love dousing those things in honey and they didn't disappoint. Our server gave us great service and the overall experience was a lot of fun for us. One of favorite things about this place is the late night happy hour and kitchen service they offer till 2am. I'm looking forward to another visit.",

The red salsa was mediocre at best. Where are the chunks? The chips are awful. There was a time, I would order to go the chips. When did you move to the cheap brand of chips?

Was violently ill for 8 hours after eating the spicy crab cakes. Violent, like The Exorcist violent. I know the aoili is hot (thank you one million to the bartender for the warning) so I only had a small smear. The manager previously responded, before deleting, to state the aoili accompanying the crab cakes is the hottest thing on the menu (hint: maybe don't kill guests on the appetizer menu? Just a suggestion) My guts are still in severe distress. This goes beyond just the heat, sadly. Something is dirty in the kitchen.  The bartenders were fantastic and it was a cool place. I will be back for happy hour because my bestie works around the corner and visits this place often for happy hour. I can't ever eat there again. Ever.

Service was excellent, our waiter was Nick and he was very patient and kind.  We came at midnight on a Saturday night and ate from their Reverse Happy Hour Menu which is from 10:00pm to 2:00am. We ordered the New Mexican Potstickers which were amazing! I highly recommend them. They were chicken and Anaheim Chiles with a sweet corn cream sauce. We also ordered the Lobster Bites which were huge fried balls stuffed with Green Chile macaroni and cheese, and lobster. These were okay, wish they had added more lobster, I barely tasted it.  The setting and ambiance is just gorgeous. Excellent outdoor lighting, great firepits, wonderful sounds and views by the waterfall, and just a perfect place to have a drink, snack, or dinner with family, friends, or a date. I'm definitely coming back soon.  I did ask about the bat art and where they got it from. I wanted to order some from the artist or company they got it from for my own home, like the hanging bats near the bar, and the metal bats outside, but no one seemed to know. They mentioned the owner would have known but he wasn't in at the moment.",

Food: Started with the cheese crisp which is rarely seen in NM, basically an open face quesadilla. Although not a traditional New Mexican item, the standout was the chile! Excellent flavor. We share the Enchantment platter which is a combination plate. Standout on this plate is Carne Adovada burrito and green chile. Would have liked to taste more red chile on the burrito.  BIG disappointment...bartender gave the remote to a bar patron who decided that all TVs should be on 2 basketball games. We were in the midst of a entertaining UFC fight. What in the world?? Grrrr. Last item to note, black beans. Never did grandma whip up a pot of black beans.",

    "text": "Thanks to yelp, we checked in and got free chips and salsa so it pays to be a user. We ordered off the happy hour menu with 2 minutes to spare. This gave us 8 a few minutes to decide what to order since we arrived 10 minutes before happy hour was over. My husband and I ordered the filet tacos and New Mexican Potstickers off the happy hour menu and the Blackened Scallops Special to share.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and the veggies/rice sides were good. The sauce on the scallops made the dish. The beef in the filet tacos was very tender and tasty and three tacos were served with a side of beans. The taco was dressed with guacamole on a very thick flour tortilla.The pot stickers were delicious with a slight teriyaki taste.   I had traded one of my filet tacos for a shrimp taco ordered by my mother-in-law and had a difficult time determining which was better. I loved both.  The server was busy, yet had time to chat and ensure everything was fine. And, we purchased a Restaurant Arizona card at Costco which discounted the meal by 30% (the $100 gift cards only cost $70 to purchase.)  The parking lot is a bit small but there is valet available. The parking lot is quite active so we found a spot by just waitng a few minutes. We did not have reservations but was immediately seated at one of ghe last available tables outside.   We sat near a water feature and the babbling water was soothing. There was a wood fireplace and occassional whiffs of smoke would drift by just enough to smell pleasant and not enough to be irritating. We were lucky because the weather was perfect.  I was a bit weary of the bat cave theme i had read about but it turned out to be fine. I would definitely go this restaurant again and now my husband wants to go to New Mexico to visit the real Carlabad Caverns.",

I work about a half mile from this place, which should allow more than enough time to get your food back to work without it being cold when you get there.  This was not the case today.  I am not a fan of cold, soggy french fries.  The fries had the potential to be good but when they are cold and soggy I just can't do it.  The BIGGER issue was the burger I ordered.  This burger was RARE.  I don't eat burgers unless they are well done.  I bit into this burger and the taste was of raw meat.  I went in to the kitchen at work to cook it further and had to cook it through our little oven TWICE to get all the red out of the center of the burger.  There is no excuse in my book for serving someone a burger that has barely touched a grill unless someone specifically orders it that way, and I most certainly did not.  I really don't think I will eat here again but if you do get food here, eat at the restaurant, do not order to go.  You will be disappointed.",

The restaurant/bar looks like it can be hopping on busy nights, but on this particular night (Wed), it was slow.  I saddled up to the bar and asked for a menu.  I asked the bartender if they had any IPA's and he suggested the Odell brewing company IPA.  I went for it and asked him what he would recommend I try.  Since  it was considered 'late night', there was a special menu and he suggested the Pork Loin Sliders (3 Sliders with Pepper Jack, Poblano Serrano Mayonnaise, and Tortilla Encrusted Onion Rings).  It sounded awesome, so I went with it.  The IPA was really tasty and hit the spot.  After a few minutes, the Pork Loin Sliders came out.  I spread the Poblano Serrano Mayo on them and then for fun added some Fries on the Sliders.  I took a small bite out of the first Slider and it was awesome!  The Pork Loin was moist & juicy and the Poblano Serrano Mayo was the perfect compliment....adding a nice bite to the flavor.  I devoured the Sliders within a few minutes and then sat back and enjoyed the rest of my IPA.  I really enjoyed this place and would like to return on my next trip to Scottsdale.",

Drinks are way overpriced and the mixed drink one of us had was actually undrinkable - not sure how that happens. Service is pleasant, but a little slow and we could have easily been out of there in half the time; if you go expect that.  Based on the price and quality we won't be giving this a second shot.  Bit of a disappointment.  Noting comments from the Restaurant - Thank you for responding.  Would agree that yes, the food and prep does vary from region to region; this was just very different.

Dinner salad was very nice, more than just a bowl of lettuce.  House dressing was the best choice (jalapeno ranch), cream but with a bit of heat.  On a previous visit I had the seafood pasta special which had tons of seafood and a VERY spicy red sauce.  I enjoyed it, but if you want just ask and they will tone it down for you.  Customer service here was excellent.  Wait staff quite knowledgeable on the menu, willing to explain what's hot and what's not, give recommendations, and just make it an enjoyable experience for you.",

The inside is pretty small from what I saw (compared to the patio area), and we decided to sit in the bar.   Used my Yelp check in for free chips & salsa, which were okay. I had a skinny margarita, as it was HH and it was very good and strong. We both had burritos, I had the green chile burrito with adovado, which was very good! I had the leftovers today which were just as delicious. The only reason this isn't a 4 is because the interior could use some attention, even though it's campy, there was visible dust and cobwebs.   Either way, I'll probably be back",

If you enjoy great food and nice people in a non-pretentious atmosphere that brings you back to the southwest, this place belongs on your list of places to try. And if you enjoy spicy food, order the habanero burger.. Fantastic! If you don't do spicy, don't worry. The menu has something for everybody.   The theme here is all things New Mexico. Even the bar is made of copper with little red chili Christmas lights creating a really inviting Southwestern ambiance. The menu is paper (which is far more sanitary) and looks like a newspaper. Take the time to read it, it's hilarious!!  There is also an extremely cool outdoor area to enjoy drinks with friends & family in the beautiful AZ weather.  Ask for Krista in the bar area (bar top & booths), she'll take great care of you!",

We got in just before they stop serving dinner (10 PM) and I appreciated that we didn't feel pressured to not to order a meal. They're open until 2 and it sounds like they have a separate late night menu for food. They had some fun sounding mixed drinks too. I tried the prickly pear old fashioned that was super unique and tasty. Not only was the prickly pear a nice twist but it also had Frangelico. All three of us enjoyed our food. I was really impressed with my stacked enchilada. It was super flavorful and filling. I tried my friend's Carne asada NY strip. It was cooked beautifully and was quite tasty. It was spicier than I expected. Our server, Veronica D was attentive, friendly and helpful. She helped make my first experience great",

If you & a friend or date want to try a variety of things, the Enchantment Platter includes the adovada, some good chicken, and a chile relleno.  It's enough food for two.  I think there was a $5 second plate charge, but it's still a decent deal.  I need to try their machaca in red chile sauce next time I go.",

I had never been there but the waitress (Natalie) and her Waiter-in-training (Xavier) were extremely friendly and gave great recommendations from the menu.  The multi-color chips and salsa (a red one and a green one) were a delightful snack while I waited for my friend to arrive, and the bar was not stingy with the alcohol in my cocktail!  The meal came quickly after we ordered and every bite was delicious. The menu has many spicy options but Natalie was sure to help me order my meal so as to accommodate my sensitive pallet (sauce on the side).   I do not have a singe complaint and will use this place to meet up with other friends in the near future!",

The interior and exterior of the place is very fun though and that's part of the reason for giving a higher score than just 2 stars.   I ordered the guacamole, chips and salsa for a starter. The guac was for sure nothing to get excited about. They played it pretty safe. Nothing unique about it at all. Very simple. I guess you could also say it was very americanized.  Also ordered a Pina Colada. It was okay. A tiny bit too sweet but not bad.  For my entree I ordered the Vegetarian Enchiladas with mushrooms, asparagus, some special spicy creamy sauce, rice and beans. The flavor was a little weird. The type of weird that would make you question if you might be spending the rest of your day getting cozy in the bathroom. Very weird mix of flavors going on with that plate.   Lastly, I ordered the Prickly Pear Flan. Which was actually the main reason I chose to eat at this place. When it arrived at the table, the presentation of it made me feel it might have been a few days old. Was all crumbling apart which is something I've personally never experienced with flan. Check my picture out of it. The look of it looked disgusting but the taste was yum. Although, I didn't taste the flavor of the prickly pear as much as I had hoped.   Eh. I wouldn't eat here again.",

Chicken enchilada, pretty tasty, but the blue corn tortilla was tough. Pork enchilada was good. Chile relleno, good. Rice was okay, came with black beans, not a favorite. I prefer frijoles, pinto beans. Sauces were tasty, spicy but not burning hot. Our server was very good, a nice young lady!  Not so good... Sopapilla was flat, heavy and tough. They are supposed to be hollow pillows, light and puffy. The ambience is unique, but the interior is rather worn and grungy. Conflicted because overall food was okay, service very good. Priced appropriately. Overall, a pretty cool place, wish the food was a little better.",

The green salsa was awesome. The red salsa was more neutral like blended tomatoes.  The green chili was not what I expected. Although it was kinda bland, there was plenty of soft pieces of meat that made for a hearty meal in itself.  I was disappointed in the sopapilla. It was smaller than I most restaurants in New Mexico that serve them. Granted it was tasty with honey.  I doubt I will come here again for the food.  I would come for drinks perhaps since it has a really cool ambience.  Atmosphere : 4.5 Food.            : 2 Service         : 4",

    "text": "We decided to celebrate an anniversary here because of the decor, the Yelp check-in offer (three color chips and two salsas), and the food.   The Yelp check-in offer is really great, but the chips left a little less room in my stomach for the main entree. That's not a bad thing if you can control yourself with the chips (I just didn't).  Recommendation: The Prickly Pear margaritas are really yummy (especially during happy hour).   You'll also find a lot of great choices on the menu (which is in the form of a newspaper). I enjoyed the decor with the bats hanging from the ceiling and the beautiful entrance with rock formations and waterfall.   My Green Chile Burrito was very good. I did order guacamole, as I felt that was missing on the burrito. I don't know if it ended up being the cup of homemade guacamole, but it tasted pretty good, so I'm guessing that was what it was.  Great place with some yummy food and fun decor, plus remember the Yelp check-in offer!",

Thus the reference to the bat cave. No, they don't serve fried bat or vampire bat margaritas! They have two happy hours, one from 2-6 pm and the other from 10 pm to closing. The service was excellent, the margaritas were yummy and the food was delightfully filling. To be truthful, after chips and salsa and a cowboy meatloaf, I was stuffed to the gills. A great experience and brilliant ambience. A fun place to take a whole group of friends (room for about 12 without running out of space inside the bar cavern). Awesome outdoor patio for when the temperature drops below 90 degrees. Room for a larger group-maybe 20-30 adults. Holy catfish, Batman, this place is totally the bomb!",

Any place that has a waterfall and water rushing past while I eat has my vote!  The extra lovely addition is the misters. When it's a \"warm\" evening the misters are so refreshing.  The salsa has a special kick to it!  Love the Chef's twists on the simple Mexican Cuisine.   He makes you feel like you are experiencing out of the ordinary.  I actually did a reading of a few excerpts from of one of my Amazon books at a lunch there one time.  It was a lot of fun and again the servers are really in tune with a diner's needs.  Karen S.

Having lived in New Mexico for 3 years I get the craving every once in a while and decided to come check this place out.  The venue itself is quite surprising as it has water features and a neat decor I wasn't expecting from the strip mall location.  The food was great I enjoyed their green chile, but wished it had been a bit hotter.  I had a sampler type combo dish for dinner, everything was great if I had only one complaint, it would be that I wish I had the choice of pinto or black beans instead of just getting black beans.  The chile was good, as was the salsa, I knocked a half star off for the straight out of the bag chips.  Well worth a visit, and overall 4.5 stars.",

They used to have an excellent rib eye, and I was quite miffed when they stopped selling them. The waiter told me they could not get a consistent product and cost were high. I find that hard to believe but whatever.  I have also tried the Habanero cheese burger. This is not for the faint of heart. I tried it 2 times. The first time it was not as hot as I expected. I did see another older couple who both ordered it and it was quite humorous (to me) the husband took one bite and got this very unhappy face, and never took another bite. his wife ate the whole thing.  The second time it was definitely hotter, almost too hot for me to eat. I was sweating up a storm. but it was very good. If you think you like spicy food watch out this burger is way hotter than you think. If you think taco bell is spicy then don't even think of trying this burger.  I would like to see their menu change more often, and maybe serve more dishes with lamb chops. Bring back the rib eye!  All the margaritas are excellent here.",

    "text": "It breaks my heart to have to write this review of a restaurant that used to be one of my favorite places to eat in Scottsdale.   Today we were having a Sunday brunch for my bestie who lives in Texas. I had fond memories of the food, and especially the sopapillas. We arrived at noon, it wasn't terribly busy, so we sat outside on the patio.   First off, we ordered margaritas and several others decided on the bloody mary bar. The margaritas were gross, salty and sour w/ limes that were long past their prime. The bloody mary drinkers were made to wait...and wait...and wait for their glasses to walk inside to make their drinks.   We ordered our entrees at about 12:30-12:45 and didn't get them until after 1:30. When I received my carne adovada burrito, it had been nuked beyond recognition, the rice was shriveled and was burnt onto the plate, as were the black beans. My first bite of the burrito was a hunk of fat...that pretty much ended it for me, also, the sopapilla I ordered for the dish came out 20 minutes later after I reminded him. The sopapilla was not at all like I remembered, and was more of a flattened piece of naan than anything else.    The rest of my party had varying issues with their meals. To add insult to injury, my lunch cost $55 for one gross burrito, 2 drinks and a piece of bread pudding due to whatever gratuity they added. The waiter was surly...when he was present at all, which was rare. No water refill, completely unapologetic for the various issues with our experience, and never took away the offensive margaritas he served in the beginning.   Needless to say, we will not be returning. What the hell happened to this place??! ugh! BUMMER!!!",

Whenever you want really great food without the pretentious atmosphere or patrons of some other restaurants in Scottsdale, Carlsbad is the way to go.  I've loved every item I've ever tried there, especially the Green Chili burger and Carne Adovada.  Also, they have the absolute best french fries I've ever had, especially with a side of chipotle mayo.  I agree that the chips/salsa should be free, as that's standard for most mexican/new mexican restaurants, but it's not that important.    They also have a good beer selection and always have one special seasonal selection which is always good.  The seasonal tends to be a Four Peaks offering, but I've also had Trummer Pils and Hoegaarden as well.  The service has always been great, the prices are excellent, and they're open late for when you're craving food at 1am.  I only wish that I lived closer!",

    "text": "DELICIOUS!!!! When we set out to have dinner last night we thought we knew what we wanted but this place blew our minds. Carlsbad Tavern has so much character, it's almost Disney-like. The patio has a waterfall and a cool outside atmosphere. Inside is very \"bat cave\" and I love it. I do wish there was a little more light in there (sometimes it was hard to see what I was eating) but I can move past all of that.   Everyone is extremely friendly and quick to seat you. We were able to get a very private booth which was nice on a busy Friday night.   Lets get to the food. AMAZING! The chips and salsas (thats right, two yummy salsas) are a must have. These things are to die for! My boyfriend had the Enchantment Platter and he said it was exactly that. I had the new Veggie Enchiladas and they were very good. I picked some of the spinach out cause it seemed like too much.....  but maybe I'm just picky?? We had some hot and very fresh sopaipillas with honey for dessert. YUMMMM!!!  Our waiter delivered excellent service and was always checking on us. I did hear some of the wait staff complaining about a tip someone left him last week. Not very professional. But I've been a server and I know how it is. Keep the complaints for after work.  Our experience was excellent and we found ourselves asking why we don't come here more often. Believe me.... we will!!!",

    "text": "It had been years since we had visited this location; upon a spur of the moment decision, my husband and I decided to drop in for dinner with our young son.  Upon entering, much to my surprise the place looked just about empty; then again it is a Tuesday night.  The host greeted us warmly and offered us a booth which we eagerly accepted.  Once seated, it was clear that the only positive experience of the visit was the host.  We sat for at least ten minutes without being acknowledged.  At first we patiently enjoyed one another's company as we all came in in good spirits.  Finally my husband asked the bartender (who was close by) who would be taking care of us.  The bartender graciously came over to take our drink order while we awaited our (absent) server.  We each ordered a margarita without salt, which he repeated back to us and then promptly brought two heavily salted margaritas.  At this point I was grateful just to get service and proceeded to wipe the salt off of the rim to enjoy my drink...That was until our absentee waiter, Tyler came over with a condescending smirk and absolutely no apologies.  When my husband asked him why it was that we had not been acknowledged, he actually leaned into my husband's personal space and smirked again and stated ver batem: \"What do you want me to do about it?\".  My husband politely replied that we simply wanted to place an order...His reply: \"Well I have a whole other dining room full of guests besides you.\" (followed by another smirk and again, leaning into my husband's personal space).  At that, we got up to leave.  We have now arrived at Los Sombreros where the ambiance is night and day.  Here too we have fond memories and yet have not revisited in years.  So far the service and food is above and beyond our expectations.  The entire staff has been more than warm and welcoming. (Review soon to follow).  Do yourself a favor and skip Carlsbad Taverns where there is a snooty feeling of entitlement amongst the supposed 'servers' and a complete lack of regard or decency in general. Take the short drive only a few minutes up the road to Los Sombreros where you are welcomed, treated and fed like family.",

The bartender greeted us quickly and served our drinks. We weren't going to order food but as 10 o'clock came around he informed us that they were switching over to their late night menu that included food and drink specials! I'm a big fan of whiskey and Jameson was only 5 bucks after 10pm! How can you pass that up! We couldn't stop there tho, after checking out the food on their late night menu we decided to get some snacks. Got an order of carne asada waffle fries, boneless wings, and pot stickers. The food was awesome came out quick! It's tough finding a place that open late and serves good food! We will defiantly be back soon!",

He was very knowledgable about most everything and he really did an amazing job making is laugh. He suggested the brochettes and potstickers for appetizers which were very good.

We bought a condo just a few blocks away about 6 months ago, and have had a blast trying new restaurants in the Old Town area.   This place had a great atmosphere and we were very happy to be seated near the water fountains. Things went downhill from there. To be blunt, our waiter was just a flat out a jerk. When my girlfriend asked if there was anything on the menu that wasn't spicy, his response was rude and he acted like how dare she ask a question like that!  He said that she might as well just have a cheeseburger.  We were in a Mexican restaurant and my girlfriend was told she shouldn't have Mexican food!  We asked for chips and salsa (not free like in EVERY other Mexican restaurant BTW). When they were delivered the guy said something like \"this sauce is hot, and this sauce is hotter\".  When the waiter came back, my girlfriend asked him if they had a cheese sauce for the chips that wasn't spicy and he acted all jerky again and said \"no\".   At that point we left and will not be back. We went a few blocks into Old Town and ate at Los Olivios and had a ball. Not as fancy, but \"normal\" Mexican food with lots of non-spicy options. Great waiter too!!!",

Seemed a little pricey $15 meals-They are huge though For 3 women we barely ate half our meal so definitely we should have split   3 meals with 5 drinks total (3 house wines & 2 beers) was $75 plus tip  $90 total seemed stiff to me but I live in Gilbert with 3 little kids so maybe I am bad judge of eating out pricing ???   They should really give out free chips & salsa-If they start doing that then I would give them 4 stars",

A couple reviews said the Enchantment Platter had four items with rice and beans: Two different enchiladas, a relleno, and a sopapilla. It was huge so I thought for sure I would have leftovers. Nope. I ate the whole thing. All were so yummy. If you \"check in\" on yelp, they give you free chips and salsa. Thanks!",

The fact the manager laughed at me when I called to make our original reservation, the fact that NO honey came with our soapailla and my friend paid $6.00 for 3 tablespoons of guac were left off of the original review.

They also do a pretty tasty sopapilla.  The inside is a bit dark, but its a cave right?  And they have a killer patio with water falls when its not blazing hot outside.   Note: I hear their lobster enchiladas are killer (though i don't eat seafood) and the Habanero burger got Food Network magazine's best burger in AZ!",

The service is very good. We asked for some more of the red sauce and it was brought to us in a minute. Water glasses were refilled before they were empty.  They also make excellent burgers but do tend to overcook. If you want medium well, ask for medium rare. On another occasion we asked for medium well and got hockey pucks.  On your birthday you get a choice of a margarita or a flan. I got the flan and it was splendid. My companions ordered the key lime pie, bread pudding and a chocolate cake. Everything was yummy.

Food: not as good as authentic New Mexican food served in New Mexico, but that's my opinion. Much better than average AZ Mexican type fare, have had blue corn enchiladas, very tasty but needed much more \"kick\". I like my Mexican food spicy, someone who prefers mild would be totally satisfied. I just kept dumping hot sauce on my food.  Habanero burger: just a big, juicy burger with a lot of spice and nice sides, salad and fries. A great burger, but would be inclined to order from the Mexican dishes menu. After all a burger is a burger. I don't think you come to Carlsbad Tavern for a burger, you come for New Mexico type food.  Dined here some years back, my recollection was that the chips and salsa were free at one time, but of course not now. Considering chips and salsas are inexpensive ingredients, I think they should be gratis. Far less well known Mexican restaurants put a platter of chips and salsa in front of you when you sit down to dine.    All in all, a very pleasant atmospheric place to dine, bartenders very friendly and helpful, laid pack place to relax. I would NOT call this comparable to True New Mexico cuisine. I have not tries Los Dos Molinos yet, have heard they are authentic , wish they had a Scottsdale branch.",

We sat in the dining area surrounding the bar and got great service. The waitress was very attentive and you could tell she really liked her job and was knowledgeable about the entire menu. The chips and salsa were really good. The chips were a variety of white, red and blue corn with a light dusting of spices. The salsas were chunky and very tasty. They bring you red and green, and are nothing like what you get around town. Very good. I ordered the filet mignon tacos, which came topped with cheese, pico, and guacamole on flour tortillas. They were delicious. My husband got the open faced green chili hamburger which was smothered with their green chili sauce and cheese. It was amazing.   We of course ordered drinks. My husband got  his usual beer, and I tried the skinny margarita. It was awesome and reminded me of what an authentic margarita should taste like. I also got the sangria and it was good. Not as sweet as what I normally expect though.  We will definitely go here again with our son this time as they have a kids menu. It's not a stuffy Scottsdale restaurant and has character and awesome food!",

Seriously? We're not talking cappuccino, people and you're selling build-your-own Bloody Marys for the same price! * The carne adovada was tender but not very spicy.  That said: * The green salsa was really good. * I'm so desperate for carne adovada, I'll settle. (besides, $9 is more than a fair price for 3 eggs, black beans and carne adovada in a bowl on a flour tortilla - even if it was more beans than pork.) * There are several options for $5; and, if they are all like the eggs benedict, they are generous portions. * The patio is nice and the bar area feels like a neighborhood pub (not a cave, but that's not got to be a bad thing!)",

It was pretty empty by the time we got there since it was so late. And it's quite dark inside, haha. But the food was GREAT!  We ordered the crab cakes as an appetizer - YUM. Definitely get these, you won't be disappointed. We also got the Fresh Snapper Tacos (nothing special, but the fish was really really good) and the Stacked Enchiladas - SO GOOD. It was so dark in there that I didn't realize it had a fried egg on top...a really nice surprise :)  We also ordered the Flan since all the reviews said it was good. But it was just okay...too thick & rich for my liking. But overall, great place! I would come back again.",

    "text": "Sad to say, but I have to knock off a star and remove Carlsbad Tavern from my \"Best of\" list. My last experience there wasn't very good. Overall, I still love this place. I've taken out-of-towners here, and will still return myself. However, my last experience there makes me hesitant to recommend it to everyone.  The flavor of the food we ordered was bland, and the temperature was much too close to lukewarm for my liking. The Lobster Enchiladas were meager, tepid, and the flavors didn't really meld. We've ordered these before and they were much more bountiful and robustly flavored. The fish tacos were \"Bleh.\" No flavor and they smelled profusely like fish--which often means the fish isn't very fresh. I don't often order seafood in the desert because of the freshness factor, but I thought I was safe at Carlsbad. Maybe not.  The service was good, thankfully; and they offered to replace my meal with something else. I took them up on the offer, and the replacement meal was much better than the one I sent back. Still, Carlsbad Tavern wasn't the type of place from which I expected to receive a sub-par meal. I can only really say now that it's 4-star good, and not 5-star amazing. Hopefully my next experience there makes me want to add the fifth star back.",

    "text": "Every once in a while you come upon a restaurant that has it all. Well this gem in Scottsdale Arizona is just that place.     First of all Carlsbad Taverns has a sizable parking lot, however, it can fill up quickly because this place is so popular. They have solved this by offering free valet parking.     Just walking from the parking lot to the main entrance is an experience. This restaurant has maintained a beautiful green lawn area with palm trees present that draws you to the main entrance. The entrance appears to be made out of  adobe. There is a large brightly painted Archway with the name of the restaurant and a simple sign saying \"New Mexican Grub\".     Walking through the archway into the restaurant itself is jaw dropping. You are welcomed by a 30 foot waterfall which which drops into a beautiful little lake. While you're taking all of this beauty in you can see other customers down below seated around this lake enjoying their meals. But that's only the beginning, as you have to walk into the inside dining area which to me re-created the experience of walking into the actual Carlsbad Caverns. As your eyes  adjust from the bright Arizona sunlight to the dimly lit inside dining room you see many separate dining rooms and just a myriad of unique decorations adorning the walls. It's something to be seen especially if you love New Mexico and the Carlsbad Caverns.    You can now exit to the outside seating area which is just as beautiful as can be. There are so many small touches such as the bat built into the fireplace. The more you look around the more you'll see. But overall the ambience is just incredible and I'll just leave it at that.    Our waitress was just incredibly friendly and as I looked around I saw this restaurants customer service was just impeccable for all.  Taking our drinks and food order was all done with a smile. The menu itself is unique because it is a newspaper (The Daily Guano) complete with headlines and news on the front page.  Once you look at the menu you can see that it is wide ranging and just like reading the newspaper you can take your time and find what you want to order.    But what good is all of the above if the food if sub standard? Well no worries here because everything served was well plated, visually unique and delicious. As the saying goes, \"you know quality when you see it\".     I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant and I highly recommend it to all.",

Their patio outside is among the best in the area that includes a gorgeous river like fountain running along the building . There are also some fireplaces and a surrounding wall structure decorated with Mexican style furnishings and art that  gives a feeling of peaceful seclusion from the busy streets just outside.      Before I mention the food I have to give a shoutout to the service . Our waitress Stephanie was a rockstar .  She was so friendly and professional. Our drinks were never empty and she answered every question about the menu we had without hesitation,  if she's available I would recommend sitting in her section if possible .   We have had the pot stickers before which are my favorite appetizer. They come with a sweet cream sauce covering the plate that I could drink in the form of a milk shake . It's ridiculously good so if you haven't ordered this dish I highly suggest it . I also loved the filet tacos with black beans . The steak is so tender and the accompanying black beans are among the best I've had . There's a depth of spice and flavor in the black beans that makes you not put the spoon down . I finally manned up and ordered the Habanero burger this visit . This burger had been featured on the food network at some point for its fiery habanero blended beef and accompanying pepper infused fixings . I feel if I describe it I will ruin the suspense of going into the unknown with your burger venture so I'll just say this . Eat the pepper that comes on top to fully experience it and Order a glass of milk BEFORE . It was delicious .",

So I was pumped to find Carlsbad Tavern!    I'm into campy stuff so the whole tavern cavern theme was appealing to me.  It's like dining in a cave.  They have a great patio too but I don't do 115 degree dining...no sir!    The food was pretty good and what I expected for Scottsdale.  The hubs got a Enchantment Platter and I got the Calsbad Tacos.  I enjoyed the hubs plate more than mine so I kept stealing his food.  If you haven't had New Mexican food and don't know what to order get the Enchantment platter!  It comes with a carne adovada burrito, chicken enchilada, a chili relleno, all smothered in red and green chili (Christmas style) with a sopapilla on the side. Ahh that hatch green chili burn!  It is so different from all the other chiles.  It cannot be described it just needs to be experienced.  The sopapilla was a little dense and flat.  I so wished it was soft pillow-y, puffy, and cloud like but no...oh well.  My tacos were served on those bigger tortillas which is what I was raised on in NM.  The filet mignon was kind of tough.  The flavors were were good and I appreciated the gobs of cheese (NM style!) but was a little disappointed in the texture.  Overall, it was a decent meal in a fun environment.",

    "text": "In the home stretch now and we're finally in some familiar territory; first stop I need my fix from Carlsbad! I have been going to this place for about 12 years now, spent literally 1000s of dollars and wasted eons (and my trusty liver) at the bar. I always like to introduce new friends to the joint, specifically for Green Chile Stew and the Carne Adovada, which can vary in Scoville units dramatically on a daily basis. Since the last drive was from Amarillo to Phoenix I had a lot of time on my hands to patiently wait for the gorge and once again I didn't let myself down.   At the bat cave, things always start with an ice cold Negro Modelo and perhaps a shot of Gran Centenario Reposado...this is a requisite in my company. The stew is such my comfort food, thick and juicy with potatoes, carrots, tons of hot green chile & roasted pork, then covered in Colby jack and served with a tortilla. If you need any extra heat they have habanero hot sauce plus chipotle so you and your toilet are covered there. I don't know if it has magical powers or if it's just the combination of tequila, beer and the hot chile endorphin rush but I always walk out floating in my shoes and wanting more...so much so that I went back the next day to procure two quarts of green chile stew to take back home to my baby. Next, if you have never had Carne Adovada, go, go now, and seek out the majestic dish dating back to mayan or...well frankly I have no idea, but it's F'ing tasty. First they take Pork Roast and heavily marinate it in Red Chile for up to 18 hrs, then it's slow and low roasted for like a day. It just falls apart when it arrives, and the heat can be deafening, or not, depending on which Sadist is slinging beans on that particular day. It is always served piping hot with black beans and rice, and flour or blue corn tortillas to sop up the crimson mess. Top it off with about six more Negros and you are in a happy place--every time. Salud!  Sidebar: just watch your speed driving in Scottsdale, because AZ is now a police state. If the pigs don't nab you, the speed cameras surely will. Vote Libertarian.",

Totally chill environment.  A True hidden gem. I always have to drive by like 3 times because the sign is black and it is tucked behind some vegetation.  Cheap.  Big portions.  My favorite is the carne adovada with red sauce.  It's definitely campy with fake rock walls with stuffed animal bats hanging from the ceiling in the dining area, newspaper menus and a lagoon outside, but that is part of the charm for me.  You don't have to be a fancy person to feel at home here and go ahead, bring the kids.  It's family friendly.",

Small outdoor patio, family-friendly, but being outside you have the proverbial attack of the flies. Of course we could've dined inside and skipped mother nature's friends. We started out with The macaroni and cheese fried bites which were very crispy and a side of sauce for dipping pleasures with a quantity of six. Happy hour offered a wide variety of appetizers and drinks which we took advantage of. Our server was very conscientious of the timeframe before happy hour expired and kept us apprised of the time limit. Our dinner consisted of the steak fajita quesadilla which was fabulous. We also enjoyed chicken quesadilla and their nachos which could've fed a family of eight. For dessert we had the fried ice cream which was a caramel base ice cream with caramel drizzle & corn flake outer crust. On a 1 to 5 for the desert I gave it a one only because I did not care for the corn Flake outside crust. To me it was a little tasteless but my guest enjoyed it immensely. On a scale of 1 to 5 service was the five , food was a five ,drinks were a five, as well as appetizers. Again my opinion of the dessert was a one but I believe my guess rated it as a five with one abstaining with a three star rating. I would recommend this place A five and would return in the future because of the wonderful staff and ambience of being outside. Bon appetit",

The menu did that kitschy-kootchy faux old-time newspaper sort of look, which wasn't necessarily entirely user-friendly, but was serviceable, and the indoor water feature wasn't necessarily all that great either, but the waiter was charming, and the selections on the menu seemed interesting. The food was decent; my salmon wasn't exceptional, the salsa was a little more watery than I like, and if everything overall was not exactly as hot or as spicy as I was hoping, it wasn't bad. Basically, it's a step up from Chili's and the like, if still something short of a genuine Mexican food experience.",

He had the idea to backtrack to Carlsbad Tavern; the perfect spot to unwind, relax and enjoy some great food. We sat at the bar (late afternoon and the place was pretty empty) and the bartender was delightful! Also, a couple of the servers were off duty and sat down to chat. We enjoyed the banter and the obvious friendship and felt priviledged to be included!  They have a nice happy hour menu (early 'bat' specials, ha ha)  with appetizers and drink specials. But we went straight for the blue corn enchiladas (one chicken and one shrimp is how they come, but you can have them other ways) on their regular menu. Delicious! And the margaritas are really good...tart with lots of lime, not like those extra sweet ones you sometimes get in Mexican restaurants. The menu includes other New Mexican specialties and burgers that are supposed to be out of this world.  We inhaled our food (and a couple margaritas!) and felt so much better driving home in the new car!",

Even as we walked to the front door, it was delightful to see water and a waterfall outside... making each of us trying to remember what cooler than 110 degrees is like.  Once inside, it was wonderful, the perfect temperature and a bit dark like a cave, but not so dark as not to be able to read the menu.          I ordered the special of the day, Blackened Shrimp on a house salad with deep fried onion crisps on top.  The dressing was a jalapeno ranch.  In the center, under the onion crispies, was a guacamole mash of some sort.  (The official description makes it sound much better!)   I LOVED it!   Just the right amount of flavor and heat.        Just before we got our lunch, we realized there is a Yelp Check In special!  So we got Chips and salsa for free!  Got to love that!!!      My lunch partners really enjoyed their meals too.  One had the Patty Melt.  Ate as much as she could... plenty and yummy!  Betty had the Carne Adovada Plate and in her words, \"It was delicious.\"         Tracy was our server and she did absolutely everything right.  Perfect in friendliness, menu knowledge and making sure we had what we needed right away.  We appreciated her very much.       I look forward to going back to try some more items.

    "text": "This was possibly the worst Mexican and definitely the worst New Mexican food I have ever had. I am a New Mexico native who was looking for a place to get my fix a little closer to home. I usually go to Si Senor in Chandler - it is fantastic, but a 50 minute drive for me.    At the Carlsbad Tavern,  I tried the Enchanted Platter - a sampling of their offerings and the Green Chile Macaroni and Cheese.     - Black Beans instead of Refried Pintos? - only in highfalutin Santa Fe - Heavily breaded Rellenos?- yuck - not only was there too much breading (breading! not traditional light egg/flour batter) the breading just plain tasted bad - The Green chile may have been Hatch, but just scooped out of can on top of enchiladas not  the wonderful \"Green Chile sauce\" found in NM.   -Sopapillas were served with your dinner plate!  Right on top of the rice so they got very cold while you ate your meal.  Not at all the nice hot puffy fried dough that should come at the end of the meal (see Si Senor!) - The only thing that was edible was the green chile macaroni and cheese- not exactly a traditional NM dish, but it was the only good tasting item we had here - Both the Red and Green Chile were flavorless - really did a disservice to people who want to get aquainted with New Mexican Food  Bottom Line:   If you are looking for traditional Southern New Mexico cuisine, skip Carlsbad Tavern & go to Si Senor in Chandler - that's what I'm gonna do!",

Our night also started with the hostess sitting us and then five minutes later coming up and saying she made a mistake and asked us to get up. She did buy us our first round of drinks though. We then got placed next to the waterfall in the spotlight. It took the waitress about 7 minutes to come greet us at the table after we were sat at the correct one.

When we got seated (outside) we sat for 19 minutes before a waitress came over to us to ask what we would like to drink. We ordered our drinks and asked if they could turn on the heating lamp next to me because I was cold. The short woman bussing the tables had a very difficult time getting it started, figuring out the propane needed to be changed. Then after multiple attempts to get it to work, they moved it and got 2 more which also didnt work. I was annoyed it took 3 heating lamps and 5 people to figure one out to get it's started. Guess I was that hassle guest! Lol anyways... The food was good when it was served although ridiculously hot, my husband burnt his taste buds off with his first bite of enchiladas. So he finally got to eat more after 15 minutes of cooling. It atmosphere was nice, but the service was definitely scatter brained on surprisingly not such a busy night for them..I am not sure we will returning, we definitely got the vibe that it's a local hang out kind of place, not an enjoyable evening...",

Rock shrimp is an odd mix on this dish but it worked. The flavor marination wasn't as coordinated as I'm used to in NM. The bar is high, I admit.  The NM mule name didn't make sense but it was also good nonetheless.  It's a very sweet version of the Moscow - warning only.    I've avoided this restaurant due to its bad service rep.

I think they wanna give you the nm cavern type vibe so me and my kickballer friends who came straight from the fields felt under dressed but have no fear the friendly staff shows love to everybody! We got there pushin 11 on a Tuesday night but still a very generous (variety and wallet friendly) list of choices to pick from. We had green chili Mac and cheese (only 1 other spot tops it) Carne asada fries, dumplings in a wicked cream sauce and cheese crisps with green chili. Definitely have the Carne adovada on something. We put it on the Mac and cheese you could do it on your cheese crisp or probably even the fries. Great late night drink specials. Ladies had a few different glasses of wine to choose from @ $5. Handful of draft beers... I'll definitely give a margaritas a chance next time. I was just in need of a thirst quenching beer. I wish I remembered our servers name... Slight ed Norton vibe cool guy helped us pick grub quick and friendly even though we were his only patio table by the time we left",

Their margaritas are tasty and go well with the spicy food. And, most importantly here, they know how to use those hatch chilis.  On the down side the staff always seems to require flagging down, especially right before Happy Hour ends. Would have been nice to get in one last order beforehand, but couldn't find anyone. Had the carne adovada, one of my favorite dishes, and it was a mix of tender and spicy with burnt and unchewable. Seriously, I spit out one whole chunk of meat I couldn't chew through after several minutes. There was enough good meat in there that I was full by the end (though the chips and salsa helped), but I should never have to eat around bad bits to get to the good.  My wife had the chile rellenos, and they were spicy and tasty. Might be a better bet to go with if you try the place out.",

We were out spending a day doing shopping in Scottsdale and drove by on the way home.  I mentioned it to my wife and she agreed to try it.  As we walked in we both exclaimed that this was a really cool little place.  The interior is like a cave and there is running water everywhere which I love.  Our waitress promptly sat us and took our drink order.  Our drinks came back very quickly which was perfect.  We ordered some chips/salsa for an appetizer and a couple of the chicken salads.  The chips and salsa arrived quickly and our drinks were refilled.  The salsa was awesome and the chips had a spice on them.  Most of the items in the restaurant are a little on the spicy side so if you don't like spice your menu selection may be limited.  They may be able to make something less spicy for you too but we didn't ask.  Our drinks were refilled two more times before the salads arrived.  The salads were excellent.  They were huge and had a wonderful flavor.  The chicken in both was very tender with a crisp outside.    Our drinks never went empty and our waitress was incredibly nice.  This was the best service I've had at a restaurant in a long time!  I wish all service was like this.  We ate half of our salads and took the rest along with the remainder of the chips to go.  The waitress talked with us as she boxed up the rest of our meals which was a nice touch.  I even tipped over 20% because I was so impressed by the service.  As we were heading out we were thanked for dining there by a lady at a table (perhaps an owner or manager) which was also nice.  The awesome food, incredibly friendly staff, and decoration of this place will keep us coming back.  I'm glad I finally tried this place and look forward to many more visits!",

The staff was so attentive, the owner began a conversation with my friend and ended up they were both from New Mexico and both in the military- the owner ended up paying our tab (which was so nice) then invited us back the next day for the 18th anniversary- so we went back. Once again we had an amazing time, ended up staying after the event ended and hanging out with staff and the owner. We had so much fun and this is now our new favorite place. I cannot stress enough how great the service was, the atmosphere is wonderful and  the food is fabulous as well.",

    "text": "Only reason why I'm only giving 4 stars is because of the manager Art that we had to deal with. Natalie was our server and she was amazing. I would give her 10 stars if I could. The owner of our company passed away on April 2nd a few years ago. For the past couple years we have done a happy hour/dinner at Carlsbad tavern. We have never had a problem until this year with Art. I called a week before and made a reservation just like I have done in the past and everything went smoothly and the girl that I spoke to said she wrote us down. Art called the following day and left a message to call him back to confirm. I had never had to do this before. I called back and he was not at work I called the following day and he wasn't at work again. I didn't leave a message which now thinking back I should have. He called me a total of 2 times and I called him 3. When I arrived an hour before our reservation the day of I was greeted by Art rudely. He pointed out to me that he did not have a reservation down and argued that he called me three times. He expressed that they would seat us but that my party of 20 would only have one server. I didn't mine only having one server since I knew we would be there for several hours. Thankfully we received Natalie as our server. I overheard Art arguing with another guest even bringing out the reservation book to the customer showing her that her name wasn't written down. Art gave our party of 20 and their party of about 15 both to Natalie. She was a rockstar and handle both parties. If it was just for Art we would not have next years party at this location. Since they do have employees like Natalie we will definitely be back.",

Although the restaurant does not normally provide separate checks, the manager agreed to do it for us upon request when setting up our reservation.  Our waitress was knowledgeable and efficient, assisting us in making good choices from the menu.  The food was amazing.  Just spicy enough, with great taste and a little (or a lot) of bite.  I had the brochette from the appetizer menu along with a cup of their fantastic green chili mac and cheese.  Both were excellent.

We have many relatives coming from the East Coast as well as overseas, and want them to have a unique experience.  We saw this restaurant from the outside and thought it looked nice.  After reading reviews we decided to try it.  We were greeted by the host who told us to pick any table and he would follow us with menus.  We sat at a booth but the host was nowhere to be seen.  We waited about 10 minutes before the manager finally brought us some menus.  We considered leaving right then, but we were curious to see how long we could sit there with no menus before anyone noticed.  Anyway, we started with the chips and salsa appetizer and I got a margarita.  I have never been to a Mexican restaurant that charged for chips and salsa.  They were not very good, but the margarita was fine.  I ordered the enchantment platter and the fiancee got the carne adovada plate.  Both were very good.  All in all, the food and margaritas are decent to good, the inside is a little tacky, and the service was subpar at best with the servers and bartenders looking like they would rather be at the DMV.  We will probably not return.  The manager who served us (did not catch his name) however was very friendly and attentive.",

Thank you.  Lightly sprinkled with cojita cheese.  Cooked down in red chile sauce, it was absolutely delightful.  I still asked for a side of green chile.  Not because the flavor was absolutely perfect, but because I wanted to pour it over the accompanying.  Carrots.  Corn. Zucchini.  And you guessed it, mashed pots.    I'll be back for the osso bucco.  You should go to the tavern for bucco.  But don't tell me how to eat my pork chile stew!  ;)",

So I ordered the plate, and was really disappointed. Like so sad I couldn't really eat my meal. I would like to first say that I think it is more of a personal reason than Carlsbad Tavern's issue. I grew up with Mexican Food, not New Mexican food. So when you get a plate with meat, you get salsa, sour cream (very gringo, btw) and other sauces, for lack of a better word! With the Adovada, it was meat, beans, tortillas, and rice. No sauce nothing to make it more interesting.  So I took most of my meal home and doctored it up the next day.  Lesson learned, order the burrito if you want Carne Adovada. Although Next time I go back, I will for sure get the Chile rellenos. I am sure they will be as good as I remember!",

    "text": "I am giving 4 stars on a few conditions.  But first; 1. We had a party of 12 that agreed to meet there at 11:30 PM because their web page listed a reverse happy hour menu from 10Pm to 2AM.  So one of our party arrives at 11PM and is told by the bartender they discontinued the late night happy hour.  When asked how long ago, he was told \" 3 years ago\"!  They would not honor the old prices so we went elsewhere.  In all fairness they shut down their web page to remove the reverse happy hour after we complained to the manager.  2. A week later I went in for their daytime happy hour that is 2PM-6PM.  Had the potstickers. Nothing great, but different.  Had the shrimp tacos were okay.  Had a margarita not served in a proper glass, and salt I said I didn't want.  At least they use quality tequila, not that cheap Jose Cuervo crap.  I will be going back  again but.......... 3.  If you are going to eat here go during 2-6PM, or their \"late night menu\" where  most of the prices are about 20-30% cheaper. Otherwise I think the prices are too much.  But if you are hungry after midnite when everyone else closes the kitchen, this might be a good pick for you.",

They do have traditional type Mexican food with a spin on the ingredients.  Cute concept and decor.  The outside was very neat and would be a great place to enjoy Happy Hour when temperatures are a little warmer. It was a Saturday night and the restaurant was extremely busy but we were seated promptly and greeted by our server immediately which I thought was great! We ordered chips, salsa, guacamole and drinks.  The salsa's were decent and the guacamole was very good.  I was a little surprised that they charge for the chips and salsa since most Mexican food restaurants do not.  We both ordered off the Green Chile Trail section of the menu.  I had the Green Chile Burrito and my friend had the Blue Corn Enchiladas.  Both were outstanding and portions were large!! We couldn't finish the rice and beans which were good but not the highlight of the entree.  The flavors were incredible and had just the right amount of heat.  Service continued to be consistent and friendly.  We really did enjoy our experience and look forward to returning soon.  I would defiantly recommend this restaurant for a different experience with Mexican food.",

I have read a lot of the reviews and one thing is noticeably absent and that is any  comments on their Tortilla Soup.  It is the best in the valley as far as I am concerned.   Another thing I have noticed a lot of previous reviews have mentioned is the water feature.  Some like it, some don't.  It may be helpful for some people who have not lived in valley for a long time to know that in it's previous life the building that Carlsbad Tavern now occupies was once a seafood restaurant called Pier De' New Orleans or something like that.  You can vaguely see as you walk into the restaurant the old motif of a seaside pier, and the bow of the boat was the main dining room.  So Carlsbad Tavern inherited the water feature and kept it as part of their dinning experience.  I like it and just wanted to shed some light for anyone who might find it odd or out of place.",

    "text": "Food Allergies Beware!   I would have posted this review much sooner after eating there, but it took me a while to get around to it. Why you ask?  Because I had a severe allergic reaction from not one, not two, but three different dishes that I was told would be fine for me.  I have a severe tomato allergy.  I know, I know.  It's not the best idea to go to a Mexican place when you have tomato allergies but my wife loves Mexican so I went.  We opted to go for several appetizers instead of entrees so we could have a little bit of everything.  We chose a chicken quesadilla, chicken nachos, and shrimp tacos.  I told the waitress I was allergic to tomatoes and asked if tomatoes were in any of the items.  She replied no.  When the food came out of the kitchen it looked great.  I bit into the quesadilla and BAM! tomatoes!    We promptly sent it back to be remade.  Then I bit into the shrimp taco, and you guessed it.  Tomato!   Finally, the nachos also had tomatoes on top.   When the waitress returned, I was informed that they cannot make a chicken quesadilla (or nachos) without tomatoes because they are actually cooked in tomatoes.  The shrimp was also cooked in tomatoes.   I was in the process of having an allergic reaction.  I could barely speak, I couldn't breathe, and I was experiencing a massive headache.  We just asked for the check and left.    When the check arrived, of course, the waitress billed us for everything that I couldn't possibly eat because she was too inept at her job to learn the menu, or even ask a chef about specific allergies.  I'm not a big fan of being ensured three different times that I can eat something, it arriving completely full of what I'm allergic to, then being expected to pay for it.  If you have any allergies to anything, don't go here.",

Whatever, I don't care as long as your food is good.   Ordered the Carne Adovada... bland, dry, and boring. Other diners at the table had similar sentiments about their food. Chips and salsa shared at the table was more what I'd expect to find in New York City. No spice, no flavor, and runny as all get out. I guess I should expect all of this lack of flavor and spice, as this place is obviously appealing to tourists who aren't used to our spices. This was further proved by the goofy bats all over, the fake caves, and the awful service which is so typical of a tourist trap.  TOURIST TRAP. Avoid if you're a local.

    "text": "My girlfriend and i did a 24-hour stint in Scottsdale last weekend and were craving Mexican food.  I found Carlsbad Tavern and decided to give it a try.    Granted, like most eating experiences...i peeped out the menu before hand.  I already knew what I was going to get:  an ala carte order of Green Chile Macaroni and Cheese and an ala carte order of Veggies.  I love green chile (i think New Mexico when i see green chile) so i requested a side order of green chile to go with my order.    Green Chile Macaroni and Cheese:  This was yummy.  It's served in a bowl lined with a large flour tortilla.  I knew i shoudn't have touched the flour tortilla, but the cheese was soaked through within the tortilla and after I took a bite of the tortilla.....it was gone quickly thereafter.  Okay, back to the Macaroni and Cheese.  I didn't notice a considerable amount of green chile, but luckily i requested a side, and i would put that over my mac and cheese as i was eating it.  With me, you can't go wrong with Mac and Cheese.  It was creamy and good.  I forced myself to NOT finish it...but as i type this review, i wish i had the left over so i can eat it now.    Veggies:  The veggies was a meadly of onions, brocolli, carrots, zuchinni, mushrooms...i think that was it.  It was stir-fried or grilled, in some oil.  So although it may sound fairly healthy -- the oil was a FAIL.  it was good though.  It had to have been better than some of the other richly divine dishes.    I'm sure they have a better crowd during happy hour and brunch.  But for me and my girlie...it was a good welcome to AZ straight from the airport.",

    "text": "A group of us went here for dinner Friday night since the restaurant we wanted to was super busy as it was restaurant week. I've driven by this place several times but never thought to go in. Their big bat sign in the front looks like Batman should dine there and I was never sure exactly what that place was. However, I remember reading a review not too long ago for this place that my friend wrote and decided that I wanted to put it on my list of places to try.   We got seated right away which was great since they looked pretty busy. The lighting inside is super dark. Their menus are printed on mock-newspapers which are very hard to read and not practical when you have 5 people crammed into a booth. After fighting each other off with our elbows and putting the menus 2 inches from our face so that we could read them, we all decided on what to get. Make sure you check-in too since you get a free chip and salsa app (free refills!). I wasn't too hungry since I had a big lunch so I opted for the crab cakes. The entrees were all pretty pricey, not that the crab cakes weren't but they were still cheaper. When they came out, there were two small crab cakes buried in dressingless salad on top of a grilled tortilla. The crab cakes were pretty good, nothing spectacular. The presentation was pretty odd and seems very inefficient money wise. Vegetables are not cheap and they wasted a lot of perfectly good greens. I tried eating some of it since I don't like to waste food but since it didn't come with any dressing and I'm not a bunny, I left the majority of it on my plate. I tried my boyfriend's quesadilla and it was pretty good. The serving wasn't huge, like half the size of a tortilla. They also used some kind of cheese that I didn't like, it was a little too pungent for me to use with a quesadilla. My friend got the pork chops and let us try a small bite. I don't really care for pork but I have to say that it was really good. The glaze/sauce that it was covered in was sweet and just right.   Maybe I didn't order the right thing, but I didn't want to spend a ton of money on food when I wasn't that hungry. If I were going to spend that much money on an entree, I'd rather go somewhere else. The service was great and our server made sure that our glasses were always filled with water. Overall, this place was kind of a miss for me but now I can say that I've been to the bat cave and wont have to wonder any more.",

Rice and beans were also equally excellent. Come to think of it, i coulda given it a 5 star meal if it wasn't for the arrogant bartender. Oh and if you haven't read, you have to pay for the chips and salsa.",

Because the service it outstanding. Matt & Jacob were working last night- we always have such a great time with them. The conversation, the drinks, the food. It's like our home away from home.   My husband had the Surf & Turf and I had a bite of the filet and the shrimp and both were supremely delicious! The filet was cooked to perfection and smothered in shitake mushrooms. To. Die. For.  He ate everything on his plate. I thought he was going to lick it clean.  (Thankfully, he knows better).  I'm dieting. I had a salad with no dressing and ate the whole thing. Really. A salad with no dressing and I still ate it all! Plus they didn't roll their eyes when I brought in my diet tonic. And believe me, I deserved at least an eye roll.  This is what I really wanted to share with you. During the month of September they have 1/2 priced food items from their late night menu. 12AM - 2AM Sunday through Thurs HALF PRICE! The sliders were already a screaming delicious deal and now they're half off.   There is a God and he loves me! Loves me to eat  Half price Sliders. AMIRITE?!",

    "text": "Carlsbat Cavern, or rather, Carlsbad Tavern, is a campy New Mexcian restaurant/bar that was the \"ethnic\" concession made to me by my parents after pleading to go to at least one regionally appropriate restaurant during my visit.  What do I mean by campy, you ask? - Stuffed animal bats on the ceiling. As G.O.B. from AD would say, \"Come on!\" - Newspaper menus headlined \"The Daily Guano\" - Bat sauce: a Habanero-based hot sauce that was mild considering the base - A cave-themed interior, a bar area, and a decorative pool/moat exterior  After I assisted my sheltered family in translating the \"unfamiliar\" menu, we consumed: - Nachos (~$6 on HH, normally ~$9): Chips were a bit light for the heaping toppings - Lobster Enchiladas (~$16): Disappointing - slightly bitter and not much taste overall - Chile Rellenos (~$11): Peppers stuffed with pork and cheese, tasty but a bit heavy - Green Chile Mac + Cheese (~$6): Standard with appreciably subtle pepper flavor - Chocolate Mousse Cake ($7): Too much cake and too much sugar, not enough cocoa - Chocolate Eruption ($7): A \"cake\" with hardened chocolate mousse and cheesecake chunks; better than the aforementioned but still overly sweet  On happy hour, for a meal made of discounted appetizers and ~$4 margaritas, I could see this being a fun choice, but skip dinner (even though admittedly I am compelled by the ample outdoor moatside seating and the Habanero burger replete with medical warnings.) While I don't feel I wasted my restaurant selection, I also don't feel I prospected and struck pay dirt in Carlsbad Tavern either and I'm sure gold is out there.",

I really just can't stop thinking about those nachos, and they have obscured most of my other memories of the place...or maybe it was booze that obscured my memory.

Things I've had: Southwest mac n cheese - This is a bowl of creamy heaven with a just a bit of a kick that will make your tastebuds sing.  Filet salad - Holy yum. I asked for this with no tomatoes, and apparently their avocado salsa has tomatoes in it as well, so they gave me just a ridiculously wonderful amount of sliced avocado instead. How thoughtful of my waiter to make that adjustment for me.   Deep fried ice cream - If you need to know one single thing about me, you should know that ice cream is my weakness. It's also my one True love. And my soul mate. If it was up to me, I would eat this for every meal, every single day, for the rest of my life. My waistline might hate me, but my tummy would die a glorious deep fried ice cream filled death. And it would be totally worth it.  The point is, the service is great, the atmosphere is awesome, and the food is phenomenal. If you are looking for somewhere to have a great meal, this is hands down the best place in the area.",

Now it's almost midnight.  You're hungry, but you're also not in any shape to drive.  Well, if you're fortunate enough to live within walking distance of this joint, you're in for a treat.  Right when you get past the parking lot, you feel like you're in line at Disneyland or Universal Studios.  There is running water, fake caverns and bridges taking you everywhere.  Plenty of tvs too but I was focused on one thing, lots of icewater and now it's time to talk about their green salsa (that happens to come for free along with chips and a yelp check in - BOOM).  In my 36 years, I have been partial to red salsa ever since I can remember.  That's only because I hadn't yet tried this one.  It's like the perfect blend of tomatillo, jalapeno and green chiles... best I've ever had.  The waiter even brought out a 2nd tub due to our inhaling it in mere moments.  So good - I can't even explain.  If you ONLY come here for the green salsa and the New Mexican potstickers you are winning at life.  I realize that maybe some of my taste buds were off due to that much day drinking, but I am convinced that whenever anything is the \"best I've ever had\" it's my duty to shout from a rooftop so my fellow friends and yelpers alike can also enjoy.  I don't remember which entree I ordered, and it was too difficult to determine what it was when I finished it off yesterday - but it was also tasty.  I will be back, and will be dreaming of that green salsa until that happens.",

When I ordered the lobster tacos, the waitress warned me without being asked that they were \"cheesy\" with tons of cheese and you could hardly taste the lobster. That sounded unappealing, So I ordered vegetable enchiladas. However, those too were extremely cheesy. In fact each enchilada appeared to contain a glob of cheese and you could barely taste or see any of the the vegetables.I think that a little bit of cheese enhances flavoring, but too much is overwhelming and smothers the taste and natural flavors of seafood and veggies. Really, it's a lazy way to cook and totally lacking in imagination.",

So we went to the next close place. Looking at the place from the outside it's built like a big dark anthill. We crossed a little bridge by an adorable outdoor patio/bar. The water and patio were clean. Walking inside we were immediately greeted by a dank smell. There are no or very few lights. There was no or very little AC and the place felt sticky. 4 in the afternoon we were only one of two families in the place. We were taken to an empty table in a big dining room. There was what appeared what once was to be a water feature/waterfall on one wall. There was no water, only a couple VERY old, VERY dusty silk plants laid around it. The walls were a dark brown black and bumpy like the inside of a cave. It felt more like an old root cellar. The table and the atmosphere were sticky. Then the waitress. Nice lady but she was wearing everyday Jean shorts and a plain black tshirt. Not very professional. She was able to take our order for 6 people without writing anything down, impressive. The drink menu was sparse. Just a couple of margaritas over ice, beer or wine. None of which sounded good so we went with the prickly pear because we hadn't had it before. Awful. Too sweet almost thick. Kind of like a thick lemonade. The food, while not expensive was severely lacking on quality. There were super hot chilies in every dish. Its almost like they were covering up for lack of taste Obviously the food had set inder a heat lamp before coming out because the black beans had a crust and the flour tortillas were hard aeound the edges. The food wasn't terribly expensive, about $130 for all 6 of us including 4 drinks. All in all, it was like having a microwaved dinner in your Grandma's basement. It's sad, because with a little lighting and some thought to decorating it could be a neat little place.",

    "text": "My husband and I came here during Restaurant Week. The menu looked enticing and the place sounded interesting. Boy, was it ever! The entire place is fashioned to look like the Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico. Walking up, it feels like you are entering another place as you walk under the large arch out front. To your left is a flowing waterfall that encompasses the patio. To be frank, the inside is dark (like a cavern). We didn't explore much inside, other than using the restroom, as my husband and I were quickly whisked to our seats on the patio. While the patio does face a busy street, we couldn't actually see the street or hear much car noise. Instead, we had a perfect view of the waterfall, eclectic decor, and night lights. Our waiter was prompt to take our drink orders and describe the Restaurant Week menu. We knew what we wanted before arriving, so we quickly ordered. The deal came with two appetizers, two meals, a dessert and a bottle of wine to share.   I ordered the tequila shrimp as an appetizer and the Cowboy Meatloaf as my entree. The tequila shrimp were delicious! They were spicy and perfectly cooked. My husband stole a few bites and agreed on how great they were. My entree, the meatloaf, was good but very different. It was mixed with jalapeno bacon and gouda then topped with prickly pear glaze. This all rested on a bed of mashed potatoes and a side of veggies. The flavors were good but the actual meatloaf was dry. My husband tried it and loved it.   My husband ordered the spicy crab cakes and the Chile Rellenos. He really enjoyed the crab cakes, but thought my shrimp were better. (I agreed.) His entree was your stranded chile rellenos - which my husband really likes. However, the portion seemed small compared to my large meatloaf dish. It was spicy and tasty.  For dessert we shared the chocolate bread pudding. Normally, I am all about bread pudding and went through a phase of only ordering bread pudding for dessert. This particular bread pudding turned me off to bread pudding and I haven't ordered any since. It was a good chocolately taste but the texture and consistency was off. I also didn't like the butterscotch sauce. My husband, however, ate it right up and enjoyed it.   Overall, my husband really enjoyed everything he had (and my items as well). I only really enjoyed the tequila shrimp appetizer and the scenery/vibe. I would like to take my in-laws here as I think they'd enjoy the ambiance and even the food (especially since my husband liked it so much). So we'll be back for another round.",

Let's talk about how her attitude and smile instantly boosted my mood. Her service was fantastic and she was even running around busy. Yet, she still had the time to make sure everything was great and still had time to joke with us. The food was incredible as well, we followed all of her suggestions including that chocolate bread pudding with a shot of baileys. Game changer. My wife now pours it on her brownies at home! I just find it fantastic how this place finally found a server worth tipping and returning to see every time!",

Upon ordering I told our waitress Elizabeth about the bad review and she asked to read it. She was in disbelief and assured us that the Chile Relleno was their third most popular menu item and she said we would enjoy it. Two of our party ordered the Chile Relleno and we loved them. Normally Relleno's have just a cheese filling, while these had pork filling with an excellent sauce, and a crunchy outside. So, Elizabeth was correct!  Three of our party had Pork dishes, and one had a light appetizer and everyone enjoyed their meal. In all cases the Pork preparation was superb and very flavorful.   We enjoyed the cave ambiance, the food, and especially our server, Elizabeth. Thank you for a delightful experience.",

Great service throughout.... just ordered fried ice cream (I'm sure it will be as amazing as Hannah described). See you soon Carlsbad Tavern!   Update- been here a few times since our great service with Hannah. Other times we've had great service and food from other staff here.   Tonight Elizabeth was not your best server. When asking if the Seafood Pasta special that was on the board was available, her response was \"I don't know I just got here\" with hands in the air. Followed by her going to the back and never returning to answer the question.   Fast forward to getting our food. Food delivered all by Elizabeth which is great in my book. But when all food and drinks were delivered, there was never any words... took over 10 minutes for her to even walk by our table after that (had to ask another staff member for mayo/'mustard).  They must pool tips here because she clearly doesn't up-sell and try to get her check average up. Margarita empty and no \"would you like another?\"... I had to ask for another as she was running away...  She lost you a star this time, Carlsbad. Your food and drinks will keep us coming",

The water feature and fireplace create a beautiful ambiance. The food is top notch. Like most New Mexican cuisine, it has some heat. I love spice, but if you're sensitive to it, this is your warning. Our hostess on the evening of January 17 was very friendly and helpful, she even checked on us after we were seated. One recommendation for the restaurant, do not fry the sopapillas in the same oil as fish. Although the fishy taste was very faint, it was noticeable. I will not deduct a star for that because the restaurant does know how to make a proper sopapilla otherwise.",

We ordered the eggs Benedict and huevos rancheros and added a side of carne adovada.  As a NM native it was a little taste of home and we were very pleased with our meal.  This was until we received the bill.  Both our meals came out to about $5-6 each but somehow the addition of carne adovada added an additional $9 to the meal. This didn't make sense as they had entire meals with carne adovada for half that price already on the brunch menu.  All we asked for was a side to add to the huevos rancheros.  We commented to our server about the price but nothing was done to make things right or at least disclosed it up front.  Unfortunately a bittersweet ending to a great meal but will not be back because of this.",

After I saw one waiter take an order and then proceed to refill a couple of water glasses for other booths, I figured we were forgotten. We must have been there 10-11 minutes. No worries, went across the street and got a table at the bar in Uncle Sals. Plenty of places in Scottsdale to eat. One star because the Nachos looked good!",

Friends told me this place is not good but I decided to try it myself.   It was a Thursday night and not too busy. Apparently they weren't busy on Wednesday because the meat in my burrito and my rice were left overs from Wednesday if not Tuesday. The meat was old and extremely dried out. My rice was hard. They also don't use seasoning. Not only was it old but there was no flavor at all.   There are plenty of good Mexican restaurants not too far from this one. Save yourself the grief and find another place to eat.  This is a follow up to the Manager who felt the need to resopnd and tell me that I'm wrong. I have in fact had New Mexican style food before both in the valley and Santa Fe. The food had NO seasoning. Second the rice was old and dried out. It was actually hard. That is not New Mexico style that's just old. I had a shredded beef burrito. The meat is in fact not cooked to order as you would suggest because it would take too long. The meat was so overcooked it was completely dry. It sat in broth or on a steam table all day. Please don't confuse users as to New Mexican as it has nothing to do with your poor food quality.",

Entrees: Two of us had the chicken fried chicken- it was terrible. The chicken was hammered almost beyond recognition, and the chorizo gravy had no flavor. Seasoned with spice but almost zero salt (this was pretty much the theme for all the entrees- spiced up with chiles, but not salty or seasoned enough otherwise.)  The chimichangas that came out suffered from the same issue- the meat and stuffing weren't seasoned almost at all, and all that came through was the chili taste. The rock shrimp tacos were so poorly seasoned, my friend took one bite and took the rest home in a box :(  Wouldn't ever go back, unless they improved the menu. Cool place and good service, but the food was disappointing to say the least.",

My dad had the stacked enchiladas and they were amazing as well. There was a slight mix up with our order but John took care of us and then some, and we couldn't have been more impressed!

    "text": "I would not recommend Carlsbad Tavern to anyone looking for quality Mexican/New Mexican food. Save your money and your stomach!!!My husband and I came in on an afternoon that this restaurant was not busy but service was still awful. Our waitress walked away before we could finish the end of our orders which in hindsight is probably why my husbands dish was completely wrong. Food was terrible and expensive for what it was. We ordered chips and salsa, the enchantment platter and the adovada burrito plate (we got something other than adovada that resembled boiled mystery beef) The Chile relleno in the enchantment platter was sloppy and flavorless. The chicken in the enchilada was dried and falling apart because of the flour tortilla (enchiladas are typically made with corn tortillas). The salsa and chips was the worst part!!!!! Red \"salsa\" is just tomatoes and red onion (no flavor) and the green salsa just tasted like blended jalapenos and lemon.  I paid $50.00 before tip for 2 entrees, chips and salsa and 2 iced teas. Such a rip off. Please please please go anywhere else.",

    "text": "Man, did anyone else get hit by that powerful hail-tastic burst of heavy rain yesterday? I was driving to Carlsbad Tavern when the clouds unleashed buckets upon buckets of rain on my car. By the time I got there the rain had subsided to a drizzle and it made for the absolute perfect atmosphere as I walked up the wooden planks into the cave-like atmosphere of Carlsbad Tavern.  But then I looked to the right and saw an empty lagoon with tchotchke plastic turtles and fish upended and scattered atop PVC pipes in the concrete enclosure. I can accept the fact that they wouldn't keep that filled during the summer though. It's a waste of water with all the evaporation, although I'd really like to come here when the waterfall moat thingy is functioning because it looks like it would be great ambiance for a fun dinner!  I got there 15 minutes late and ended up having to wait another 15 minutes for my mom and aunt to arrive (what can I say, we're a punctual family). So I sauntered up to the bar and ordered a margarita on the rocks with salt. Since it was on happy hour it cost me only $3.75 and was a smooth combination of tequila, triple sec and sweet and sour mix. For only four bucks this well concoction was one of the better margaritas in recent memory. Chile pepper lights around the bar with all sorts of bat related memorabilia managed to be campy fun rather than campy trashy and gave me plenty to observe as I was waiting.  Feeling like the traditional Mexican munchies, I ordered the tricolor chips with two salsas. This was an unfortunate choice. The salsa de casa was very coarsely chopped, which made it really hard to dip or spoon onto a chip, and was extremely heavy on tomatoes with few other discernable flavors. The tomatillo salsa tasted okay but was also chopped so coarsely it was like layering strips of tomatillo on chips. The chips weren't too bad, but they were reminiscent of oil they've been using to crisp chimichangas in for the past week. I've worked in food service and I know what old oil tastes like.  But the conversation with my aunt and mom more than made up for the disappointing appetizer, and it cost two whopping bucks so I totally got what I paid for, although it is a little disappointing that they don't come complimentary.  Once we were seated in the main dining room, I was pleased by the atmosphere and decor (stuffed bats hanging from the ceiling! high seat booths with comfy cushions! cool copper light fixtures! rock walls and a huge floor to ceiling rock feature with vegetation!), which managed to maintain a cave-like atmosphere while still being inviting. We placed our order with a very friendly server that was a natural at making small talk and joking around, instead of coming off as peeved that we were taking too long to examine The Daily Guano. I also liked the more open ended, \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" Rather than the usual leading questions like, \"Can I get you something to drink? Do you know what you want to eat?\"  I ordered the Enchantment Platter so I could try a little bit of everything, a chicken enchilada, carne adovada burrito, a chile rellano and a sopapilla. When it came out I was pretty disappointed by the presentation. It was smothered in so much sauce and cheese that it was difficult to discern just what the hell I had on my plate and it looked like my burrito had anointed the surrounding items with a liberal splash of greasy red sauce. It most definitely could have done with two plates instead of just one.   (I'll admit it. It really, really pissed me off. That gut reaction made me want to rate this place around 2 stars instead of 4. I have issues with food presentation. I rearrange every sandwich I order at a restaurant to ensure even distribution of ingredients. I don't care if things are touching and mixing it up, but it better be doing so in an aesthetic manner.)  But once I dug in it turned out to be a delicious meal! The chicken enchilada with tomatillo and green chile was deliciously cheesy with huge chunks of chicken. The carne adovada was tender but relied a bit too heavily on some weird tomato flavor that was thickened with what tasted like cornstarch, solo it was weird, but when the burrito entrails leaked all over the place it added a delicious flavor to the meal. The chile rellano was pure pork and cheese, a dense and delicious concoction nested atop rice and black bean. Rice was generic, black beans were delish. And I've got enough leftovers for three lunches, all for only $12.95!   Psst! Don't get the habenero burger unless you want to shit fire for the next week. I've heard that from so many people that it must be True! It's not served with a complementary glass of milk for no reason...",

    "text": "The fact that Carlsbad Tavern has been around so long exemplifies how forgiving people can be of a friendly neighborhood place. Large portions of mostly fried, mostly bland food, with posole and black beans added so that they can call it \"New Mexican.\" Our steak and chicken entrees were disappointingly low in flavor. Our ravenously hungry teenaged male companion gave his cheeseburger and fries two thumbs down and didn't bother to finish. Artificially colored corn chips came from a bag and were slightly stale. Avoid the guacamole--it was made of underripe avocados that had been pureed into a runny cream. Very friendly service and pleasant outdoor seating, but don't go there for the food. But if you love South Scottsdale tacky, you'll appreciate the entryway, a simulated cave entrance, and the moat circling the restaurant.",

Carlsbad Tavern gets it though. They offer truly authentic New Mexican cuisine. Some will love it, some won't.   On top of good food, the atmosphere is cool too. Even on a freezing cold night (freezing from the Phoenix perspective), you can sit comfortably on the wicked cool patio thanks to fireplaces and heaters.   Service has been above average on every trip I've taken.",

Our service was great as well, unobtrusive yet on the ball.  Our iced teas were refilled quickly and our waitress always seemed to be right there when we needed her without hovering.  But the food wasn't that impressive.  It wasn't bad, and I probably made a bad menu choice: I ordered a steak at a place specializing in New Mexican cuisine.  For $21 I expected a steak of a bit higher quality than what I received.  It was difficult to cut and had none of the grilled flavor that I was anticipating, but it was smothered in a decent creamy peppercorn-laden sauce.  However, the mashed potatoes and veggies were great. The potatoes were loosely mashed with good amount of spice added that was noticeable but not overwhelming.  The veggies were a nice variety and not overcooked.  Again, the food wasn't bad, but not as good as I was expecting for the price.  I would go back for one of the menu items that is more in line for a restaurant specializing in New Mexican cuisine, but I'll go elsewhere when I've got a hankerin' for a good steak.",

Carlsbad Tavern offers a wide variety of New Mexico style dishes that tend to leave the competition behind. People who like it HOT will love this place, those that prefer mild will find it tasty and bearable, and those with no tolerance for the heat should stay away from this kitchen. The restaurant offers a unique large patio complete with waterfalls and a small dining area with a cozy cavern like atmosphere. Beware of sitting near the pick up window during peak hours as it tends to be overly noisy and relatively chaotic.",

    "text": "Carlsbad is truly one of my favorite places in the valley, although I usually only get the opportunity to go for lunch. This place also holds a special place in my heart because it was my first real meal in Arizona. This is where I went to lunch on my first trip out here for an interview. It's also a favorite place for my coworkers and I to visit.   First things first. The atmosphere is fantastic. The inside and outside both have great seating and I love the welcome feel you get when you arrive from both the staff and the decor. The outdoor seating area is one of the best I've ever seen. If you've never sat in between the outdoor bar and the pond, you are truly missing out.   The food is always fantastic, well portioned, and well priced. Blue corn enchiladas are one of my favorites. Warning though, do not eat them if you are not a fan of cheese. I, however, live for cheese and am in love with them. The lunch specials they have are *always* incredible and definitely worth trying. I don't know anyone that's ever been disappointed by them. Last time I was there it was roasted chicken enchiladas with a mushroom cream sauce. Can I say please eat me now?  If you enjoy fantastic food, amazingly personable staff, and a great setting, this is a must!",

    "text": "I went here with a friend that is originally from New Mexico and thinks New Mexico Mexican food is the best around.  Being from the NW originally, Mexican food is pretty much all the same to me (I know that makes many, many people want to hurt me right now).  We decided to hit up happy hour after work.  They have happy hour from 3-6 and we arrived a little after 5, so it was busy, but we were still able to sit at the bar.  The problem was the only two seats left were the one where my friend kept getting hit with the drink garnishment tray every time the bartender opened it and the one where the sun was piercing into my retinas if my friend didn't strategically place her head.  We decided to stick it out to take advantage of happy hour at the bar.  We would have sat at a table behind the bar, but we were told that happy hour didn't apply there and it was for dinner only.  The happy hour there isn't so happy - Unless you think $1 off of a $9 appetizer is a deal.  Granted, there were a few lower priced items if you just wanted items such as chips and salsa, but let's face it, we take advantage of happy hour so you can get the overly priced apps for what they're really worth.  We didn't really think the specials were anything special, so we decided to pay for the drinks (no tax at the bar - a helpful hint from the bartender) and get a table for dinner.  The whole place is pretty cool inside and the patio would have been even better had it been a little bit warmer or if we had on a few more layers.  The dark wood and low lighting make it cozy and comfortable inside.  We ended up ordering the nachos to share and they were delicious with chipotle chips, black beans, cheese, and lots of other goodness.  My New Mexican guru told me green chile anything is the way to go, so we both ordered a bowl of the green chile stew.  It was good and I was satisfied, but nothing to write home about.  The service was good, as was the food, but I would only give it 3.5 stars.  The extra star is because if you go here for only one reason, go for the basket of sopapillas - it's worth it.  No more needs to be said, just go there and order them and you'll know what I'm talking about.  And don't give me the crap story about how you don't like fried dough with powdered sugar on it that you pour honey inside of because that's just crazy talk!",

I tried the Taos Pork Tenderloin and was disappointed because the pork was cut into medallions, which I believe is the reason they were dry.  Frankly, I was happier with the side items: my mixed vegetables were good and cooked to perfection and the Jalapeno potatoes are awesome but apportioned too small.  My dinner companion had the Carlsbad Ribeye with which he was very happy.  I guess it was me who thought that the meal should be more balanced than this huge piece of meat (20 ounces) served with a tortilla smaller than my hand.  I remember the first time I visited, thinking that the waterfalls were an unusual touch, but the more I sat there, the more I found myself thinking of Gilligan's Island.  A little too corny for me, I guess.  Our service was great though; both the host and the server were really friendly.",

The enchiladas and burritos were great, especially the machaca and the shrimp in the enchiladas. The green chile was tasty, as was the side of red chile we asked to try. It was the best I've had in awhile, especially outside of New Mexico. The machaca meat was really tender and had a lot of flavor.

She knew the menu so well and we took forever to order. We had drinks ( my sangria bev was so refreshing) with appetizers, then ordered dinner. At no time did our server make our party feel rushed. We were there for a couple hours having fun eating and drinking with family. Everyone's entree looked fantastic. I tried the lobster enchiladas and they were wonderful. I had the shrimp app for my entree and it was plenty. My husband had an chimichanga and it was fantastic too. We finished up with a chocolate explosion cake which we all gobbled up.  The place is charming with its theme.  I sure would go back because the menu was huge and I want to try all those New Mexico specialties you just don't see in Arizona. So glad I got introduced to this restaurant.",

    "text": "Not as great as we had hoped, heard and read.  A couple of my girlfriends and I came here for Brunch on a Sunday afternoon. It was noon but still cookin up brunch meals. I was happy bout that since I was excited about tryn their Chilaquiles. They also had a Bloody Mary bar going on but since I'd had my fill of drinks the night before at the Chandler Craft Drinks Festival I decided to give my liver a rest and not partake.  A friend and I order the chilaquiles with scrambled eggs. My other gal pal ordered the eggs Benedict w chorizo sausage patty. We wait.  Not long after our food comes. It does not look very pretty. The filet minon strips were way over cooked. The beans looked dry and the main course, chilaquiles looked like a slop of mashed up, over cooked enchiladas. Eggs weren't mixed in they were on the side. Ok so whatever it doesn't look good. I can get past that if it tastes good. Well it didn't. The chilaquiles tasted like a spicy masa (over cooked and mashed up corn tortillas). For those of you that don't know chilaquiles is diced up corn tortillas pan fried to a light crisp w eggs and enchilada sauce, meat added optional. What was presented was not at all what I was expecting or used to. My friend was so disappointed that she requested chips to substitute her need for a lil crunchy tortilla. Plus she was even more upset because the menu clearly stated that it came with queso fresco and crema (sour cream) and it came with neither.  I check in to take advantage of the free chips and salsa offer. We ate what we could muster, which wasn't much. However my friend that ordered the Benedict loved it! The waitress was kind enough to take our chilaquiles dishes off our bill. I should've known better than to eat out at a Mexican food place. I'm always disappointed. Nobody cooks like moms.   The place it's self is cute. A lil dark inside which is nice during the summer heat days.",

Our server waited several minutes to greet us, and when he came over he complained that his replacement wasn't there yet and proceeded to spit (like you do when you stick your tongue out and blow) on the table. Although he seemed to be joking and announced he'd be taking care of us, I wasn't impressed at all. It was obvious we were keeping him there late when he proceeded to answer one word answers about the menu. When we got our drinks, there was a huge crack in my margarita glass I noticed after I had several sips. When I pointed it out to the bartender, she actually asked me if I wanted a different glass or if she should remake it...needless to say, I asked it be remade completely. The ambience of the restaurant was ok, the food was just ok, and all I can remember from my experience was feeling like an unwanted guest. I served and bartended my way through college so I'm pretty understanding. I won't be going back there, and with all the great Mexican places in old town, why would I?",

    "text": "Yikes. This place is cool looking, and has nice service- but the food is totally lacking.   My friend and I went for lunch and were seated within a few minutes. I saw there was a free chips & salsa with Yelp check in. I requested that, with a side of guac. I was told that the guac would be $5. Seemed kinda steep but maybe they make it super well- so I ordered it.   Guac arrives and it is in a small cup- that could fairly be priced at 2-3 bucks- if it's quite good. This stuff was like a movie prop- it looked right but had 0.0 flavor. It was so odd. In addition to being a small serving, & having no flavor - there were also two golf ball sized chunks of underripe avocado. Like you couldn't cut then with a knife. So weird. Literally no flavor. How do you fug up guac? It's avocado, garlic, salt, lime, onion, some type of pepper. Not here though.   For lunch I had the red chilie chimi. Again- it looked nice- but really lacking in flavor and crispness of the tortilla. That came with rice and beans- both passable but that's about it.   Throughout- our server was sweet and did a nice job, without which I could only leave one star. Oddly when the bill arrived our chips and salsa were on there. Our server told us she would take them off when we pay. It's weird because if you're planning your tip off the total- but the total is off by nearly four bucks?..... Also the $5 guac was now $6 on the bill. So our chips and salsa were \"free\" but a small side of anemic guac was $6?  It's sad when the guac at Chipolte crushes this restaurant.    So buyer beware- cool atmosphere, weak food. In the future when I'm seeking New Mexican cuisine I will hit up Richardson's in Phx.",

My favorite dish is the green chili cheese crisp. It's basically a toasted tortilla that is topped with New Mexican Hatch Green Chilies, tomatoes, and cheese.  The Green Chilies are what make this cheese crisp so amazing. I've even eaten them with a fried egg on top for breakfast, but the eggs Benedict with Jalapeno hollandaise are also amazing.   They also make blue corn enchiladas that have their amazing green chili sauce as well. One is filled with shrimp, the other chicken. Make sure if you get a salad to try the jalapeno ranch, it's awesome too.  Carlsbad has really cool seating outside with a giant water fountain that wraps around the restaurant and bridges that span over it. They also have a Bloody Mary bar on weekends and TVs outside for the football games.",

Totally recommend it ... get to sample some of the best stuff on the menu all in one entree.  Margaritas are pretty good there too.   4. Service is good.  Everyone I've ever encountered is really friendly and efficient.    5.  The place as a physical structure is rad.  It feel like you are entering an Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland. A rough and tumble stone facade archway leads you up a ramp to the entrance.  Fake bats dangle from it.  A little waterfall, bridge... but no snake pit :)",

It was lunch time, and there were only a few poeple on the patio, and the dining room was relatively full. There was no host at the counter/stand...so we asked the very sweet bartender if we could seet ourselves outside, she smiled and said yes. We weren't even out the door to the patio when the host walked up and appologized for not being available. We were seated, and he brought us our menus and waters, and told us the waitress would be with us shortly. It was no more than two minutes before Tia came to our table and took our drink order. She gave us a good amount of time to look over the menu and brought out the two cocktails we orderd. We put in our order and about fifteen min later we got our appetizer, these delicous kabobs of chicken and steak. The gentleman who brought them was so nice, he made sure we had plates to share the app. Our waitress Tia brought the entrees out about ten min later, my husband had the Habanero burger, and I had the fish and chips. I have to say, this was by far the best food I've eaten in a while. The entire staff here is so attentive, and made this entire lunch date with my husband so memorable. I recomend this place to anyone wanting a great time, great food, and great atmosphere. Thanks Carlsbad Tavern, best date ever!! :-)",

At lunch time I will normally eat the Crab Stuffed Poblanos which is two poblano chilies stuffed with crab meat, peppers, onions and cilantro covered in a smoked cascabell & yellow bell cream sauce.  After 4:00 PM you can order dinner entrees I recommend the Osso Bucco which is pork shank slow roasted with serranos, garlic, onion and leeks with an apple chipotle glaze. Or the Red Chile-encrusted Halibut which is baked and encrusted with red chile spices and chipotle lime beurre blanc. If you look to the top right of each entree selection you will notice the wine pairing that is recommended for each dish.  If you like New Mexico styled food with green chiles you will love Carlsbad Tavern I think the food has the correct amount of heat and is not to spicy except for one item the Habanero Cheeseburger which comes with freshly ground habanero chilies mixed into the ground beef don't say I didn't warn you but umm good. A Habanero pepper is freaking ridiculously hot checking in at 100,00 to 300,000 Scoville units of ass kicking heat come on ice cream.

With inventive New Mexican entrees, Carlsbad Tavern provides both great atmosphere and eats!   It's steaks, ribs, and burgers are grilled over pecan wood, adding a smokiness that's a nice alternative to hickory or mesquite. It's carne adovada rivals both Richardson's and Los Dos Molinos (though less spicy than Los Dos.) Start off with the Tequila shrimp, served with cilantro pesto black beans (to die for!) Chicken tortilla soup also rocks my world...Chili rellenos are among the best I've had in Phoenix. Ribs are way up there also. The sauce is unique, flavorful, and works perfectly with the meat. Don't forget the corn muffins with cactus butter!   Well stocked bar with a friendly competent staff. They also have one of the funnier menus around called...\"The Daily Guano\"  Much more seating here than Richardson's. What really sets it apart is the tables outside. All heated, for comfort any time of year. Add to that a creek and a fireplace...and you get a restaurant that works for lunch after golf or a on date.",

    "text": "Yay a new place to add to my list of good grub and a menu that makes me want to come back several times to try out more.  My girlfriend and I went for dinner last night and had a great meal.  She got the chile rellano plate and I got a filet salad.  Yes I know I just said salad but it had filet mignon on it and jalapeno bacon.  I mean come on it's not healthy especially with the chipotle ranch dressing on it.  It was just what I needed.  I had a bite of the chile rellano and I thought they were good as well.    Like I said there were many other things on the menu that I for sure want to try so I will be back and hopefully soon.",

    "text": "I took a group of out-of-towners (from London, specifically) here as I thought it would be the perfect blend of Southwest style without the cheese and all of the kitsch. And I have to admit, it was less pastel-pink-stucco-and-bleached-cow-skulls and more twisted-Old-West-mining-camp. You'd be more likely to spot a chupacabra lurking in the shadows here than a mint green gecko stenciled on the wall. So score on that one Carlsbad.  I was mildly disappointed in the patio area - but my expectations were probably too high to begin with. Like when everyone and their mom raves about how amazing Avatar was, then you finally see it and go, yeah, I mean it was cool or whatever.   The food was pretty good, and the blend of familiar (burgers) with New Mexican/Mexican variety. Makes it hard to find a diner who couldn't find something to eat here. After dinner, some of the party headed home and a small group of us moved to the bar area to have a couple more drinks and chat it up in a more lively atmosphere. Also a score for that change up in vibe.  The one major complaint I have to share is that the server ran one card for the entire bill (we had two cards and the rest cash, with it clearly marked which card should be run for which amount) accidentally, before charging the card correctly. That wouldn't have been so bad, but he didn't bother to mention it, so my poor friend had quite the surprise when she checked her bank account to see that it was about $290 less than it should have been. I think it took about 3 business days to get that money back, and that's a long time to wait for almost $300 of your own money to get back to you. I'm sure it's a fluke and I doubt it's a common occurrence here, but sure was a bummer and not exactly handled professionally.  If I come back, it would probably only be for day drinking and snacks or happy hour, or if I had more out of towners to entertain. I wasn't impressed enough to make my way out there for a regular dinner.",

Lunch- Green Chili Stew and Lobster crescent  sandwich. Dinner- YOU GOTTA TRY \"Osso Bucco\" it is a Pork Shank, (Not Lamb) on top of  a mound Jalapeno mashed potatoes. Guest we were with  had the 'Rack of Lamb' which they raved about! They're served separated, pick them up by the bone and eat like a plate of appetizers.  Last time we were there, the 'Surf and Turf' was Rib eye and Marlin- WOW, I have never had Marlin before; this was prepared seared with a light crust- unbelievable!  OH ya.. the serve a great 'after hours' menu from 10pm until 1am!!!  If you are in Scottsdale, you have to stop by!",

The food was ok and the server had no problem honoring the yelp complimentary chips and salsa.  We each got the green chili chicken burrito.  The food was laden with cheese and not for the cholesterol conscious.  It was hard to taste much besides the cheese and the spice but, there was chicken in there too.  If it weren't for the patio/water feature, I don't think this place would be in business.",

    "text": "Solid 4 star rating, very consistent which is a trait high on my radar.  This \"is\" New Mexican cuisine, which translates to hatch pepper green sauce and sopapillas. After that the sky is the limit with variations and combinations of cooking styles.   And vary it does!  At Carlsbad there are 3 distinct dining areas, The Bar, The Cave, The Grotto. Each area presents a completely different atmosphere and draws corresponding cliental.   Casual fine dining in \"The Cave\".   Trendy down in \"The Grotto\".   You will find the regulars in \"The Bar\".  I prefer eating \"fine dining food\" at the bar, because that's how I roll. The bar tenders are witty and quick with a joke and light up your smoke if you know what I mean? The drink strengths vary by the bartenders.   Its very dark and low key and you will drive right by the entrance if you are not careful. Carlsbad is also one of the few places in town that serve late night food. You have to try this place out for yourself, nothing else like it in the valley.   My kind of place!",

    "text": "Was in the neighborhood and Yelp'd \"Nearby\" on my phone, so we ended up here.  Like several other reviewers, we are baffled by the many five star reviews of this place.  When we walked in, the first thing that struck us was the extremely unfriendly greeting.  The restaurant was nearly deserted at 8:30 and we didn't feel very welcome.  The second thing that struck us was, despite its claims to be a \"New Mexican\" restaurant, it's really more of a generic type menu.  Speaking of the menus, they are printed on newsprint and were filthy.  The restaurant in general was not very clean.  All in all, mediocre and over-priced.   We tried the Habenero burger and the machaca chimichanga.  Both just average and comparable to your typical chain restaurant.  The black beans were inedible and the rice was microwaved and obviously quite old.    We asked for some chips while we were waiting and we were told that they were $3.00.  Uhm, ok.  Surprisingly, they turned out to be the best part of the meal.  Our server was pleasant enough but the overall vibe was unfriendly despite the fact that there were only 3 or 4 tables in the immense dark cavern that is this restaurant.  I guess the next time we're in the mood for actual New Mexican food, we'll have to drive over to Rokerij and hit up the Robertson's menu there.  Vastly superior to this joint in every way.  $40 with tip and one beer. I can't imagine ever returning here.",

From spicy potstickers to salads, they've got a lot of variety. The drink special I got down with was the Tres Agave Margarita. (I know, quelle horreuer on the missing Malibu, but sometimes you've gotta try the specialties).   The drink I asked for was on the rocks, lotsa salt. And boy, did they make it like I ordered it. It was good, not as good as a certain favorite margarita place of mine, but I'd give it a 4 star on a 5-star scale.   Service was friendly and spot on. No empty glasses or dying for a drink around here. Guess the bat cave bartenders have some good drink radar going on.   The food was average. Nothing spectacular. But it didn't repulse me or remind me of stuff I used to make in home ec class. So that's a plus.   They did have Malibu behind the bar so when I return, I'll go back to my usual. Don't know if they use a pineapple gun or the cans. That may sway me into sticking with the margaritas :P",

The lobster enchiladas were good but could not be ordered without the heat as they are delivered premade each day. Lobster is not a strong flavor so the heat really masked the seafood's flavor.  The rice and beans accompaniment were also great. Friend in our group raved about the marguerita. will return next time I am in the Phoenix area. almost forgot-great outdoor seating beside a pondlike water structure.",
