The host is pleasant but our server is snooty and the taste of their food do not justify their pricing. We're from CA and dined at places that charges this much but tasted way better than this. We were in Albuquerque (El Pinto) and Santa Fe (Taberna La Boca) the weekend before and had excellent food but didn't pay this much.",

We sat in in the bar area, and the bartender grudgingly served us, never once checking on drink refills or food; she seemed offended when I asked for a clean glass (my wine glass was pre-lipsticked and not in my shade...)......  Each server  on duty on a quiet Thursday evening  had to pass by our table to pick up orders from the kitchen, not a one made eye contact or offered water refills, drinks, nor checked on food quality.  See Daren & Nathan's reviews; the owner is great, very sociable, etc, but the staff is ill trained,  not at all up to the five star food.    Towards the end of the evening, a nice young bus-girl asked if we'd like a to-go box, and she was literally the only person who checked back on our table with out being flagged down.    Previous visits had EXCELLENT service, to match the food, not so much this time........disappointed.........",

    "text": "This may be my new favorite spot in Phoenix! I have been here about three times over the last two weeks and every time was all around peeerfect! I had heard of this place a million times and had never made it in, so finally my sister was in town to visit from San Fran (total foody might I add) and I paid Fuego Bistro a visit! We were impressed! First of all their specialty-the empanade, was excellent, which you would expect considering it is the specialty...but seriously it was great right down to the house made salsa on top! We happened to be there at a slow time between lunch and dinner and our waiter was also our bartender and he made one of the best mohitos I have ever had state side! I wasn't going to drink (driving) but, after seeing my sister's, I had to try one! The pork nachos are fabulous: the chips are made fresh, the pork was perfectly cooked and the salsa again was very tasty! We both had salads and the veggies were fresh and I always love house made dressings!   Last time I went to Fuego on a date and we sat outside on the patio; it was very romantic and I ended up with the same server I had before...he is wonderful and he remembered me! My date ordered the ribs and they looked amazing and my tuna steak was tasty with the mango salsa and balsamic reduction! I HIGHLY recommend this place and the happy hour prices are wonderful considering the quality and quantity of the food!   One more thing, this place is a little hard to find tucked back off of Palo Verde Rd. and buried within the middle of a courtyard...but it is well worth the effort to find it!",

    "text": "This place is just lovely - a True hidden gem.  I discovered Fuego Bistro after it was featured on Groupon, and I'm sure glad I did!  I have been there 3 times now, and each visit was just a great as the previous.   I have been there on a date, I took my 50 year old mom there, and I also went with my mid-20s female friends to celebrate a birthday.  All different audiences, but everyone I have taken has loved it!  Needless to say, it appeals to many, and is perfect for birthdays, anniversaries and friendly get-togethers.  Environment:  I have never sat inside because I very much enjoy the outside patio.  At night, it is very quaint and romantic with a water fountain, Christmas lights of sorts, nice trees and vines, and there has been pleasant live music during all 3 of my visits.  It is a quiet venue, making it very easy to converse with those at your table.  Service:  The Fuego Bistro staff is attentive, friendly and genuine.  It seems they have all worked there for some time and that the owner does a wonderful job of making them all feel as though they are a family.  They seem to know and care about each other, they believe in the place they work, and the customers benefit as a result.  Food:  Delicious!  My absolute favorite dinner dish is the braised angus short rib roast, and I'm not even a beef person!  It is wonderfully marinated and very flavorful.  I have had all of sides from the mashed potatoes to the carrots, and all of them are great.  What I love about Fuego is that they take a classic dish and add its own flare with an array of spices and sauces.  Prices:  The dinner dishes range in the mid to low $20s, but I have only visited Fuego with a Groupon or LivingSocial voucher in hand. I love that Fuego is so supportive of deals and the waiters/waitresses are not only accepting of the vouchers, but they are enthusiastic about your savings as well.  I highly recommend you visit Fuego Bistro for a unique and pleasant dining experience!",

I ordered the Pernil Asado which is my favorite and their signature dish.  It is slow roasted suceulent pork served with an orange habanero mojo and local corn tortillas.  The pork seriously melts in your mouth and with the sauce I can't get enough of it.    For the two sides that go with it I love the Jalapeno Creamed Corn which is actually perfectly spicy and yummy.  I also got the Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes which are very good as well.    The Mojito's are a must have I usually can't go without at least two and they have many flavors to choose from I really like the Blood Orange flavor.    The best part is they usually have groupon's which make it very cost effective.",

All of which were delicious. The prime rib special had sauteed mushrooms, peppers, onion, topped with Bleu cheese, which was my personal favorite.  All the meat entrees was extremely tender and nothing needed additional seasoning (salt and pepper). Out of all the sides I would highly recommend the cornbread, mashed potatoes, cream corn, or the carrots. The cornbread was moist and had a kick to it. As did the potatoes, which had jalapeno and cheese blended in. The carrots were cook in a nice sauce and were soft and tender. I got the short rib and that had a great taste. Honestly you can't go wrong with anything.  The drinks were good, I loved the blackberry sangria, my parent's margaritas were top notch. It was a bit pricy and wouldn't suggest going with a family, but more as a date night. It's extremely romantic and has live music, tonight there was a solo pianist.",

They were \"pre prepared\" so we couldn't get them they way we wanted.  The place was very tiny. I can see why there were only one other pair of customers there in the middle of dinner time. I was expecting a lot more than what I got.",

The empanadas are a must for an appetizer. The crust was golden and perfectly and evenly cooked. That was followed by the most flavorful short rib enchiladas I've ever had. The seasonal (blueberry) sangria was the perfect addition to a magnificent meal. My boyfriend & I both found ourselves taking smaller bites and eating more slowly in an attempt to savor every morsel and prolong our dining experience. Will definitely be going back when the rain stops and hopefully sit in the courtyard for some live music.",

    "text": "Fuego Bistro was one of the go-to lunch spots for me and my coworkers. I have since left that job, or else it would STILL be one of my go-to lunch spots (oh, if only you were closer).   The food here is wonderful, and the patio is just lovely to sit at when it is nice outside. My personal favorites on the lunch menu are the chicken tacos, with the cream sauce and the jack cheese. They melt cheese between 2 corn tortillas which give the tacos an amazing texture, and the grilled chicken, and the cream sauce (chipotle cream, i believe) are a perfect combination. My other favorite is the chicken enchiladas. They aren't too heavy, I love the black beans, and they are perfect for lunch. There have been times where literally everyone at our table order the chicken enchiladas. They are THAT good.   However, I must say that my absolute FAVORITE part of my dining experience here is the rice. I'm not sure what you guys do with the rice, but my goodness. It's so fluffy and compliments the meal perfectly.   The only reason I knocked down one star, is because of one particular server that we seemed to get quite often. The staff for the most part are wonderful and friendly, however this particular server just struck me as a little rude and hurried, even when it wasn't necessarily busy. We have had this same experience every time we've been seated at his table.  But besides that, Fuego Bistro is fantastic! I highly recommend (especially the rice)!",

And, i wasn't dissapointed. everything i ate was so good. i had the empanadas app. they were good but when you put that sauce on them, it makes them even better. i had the ropa vieja with arroz con gandules y black beans. omg! everything was so yummy. the meat was tender and flavorful like my mamas! and the arroz was good along with the beans, they both had good flavor. i had the cheesecake flan which was equally good. i stuffed it down despite the fact that i was full.   the service was great. the atmosphere was chill. there was a guy performing jazz on the patio which set the mood. it was really a nice place and if i lived closer, i would be back often.   i only have 1 suggestion. you should have cafe con leche on the menu instead of just plain old coffee :)",

But the staff was very nice to us and if you are close to this place, it is certainly worth a visit.  finally, i am a HUGE fan of small, local owned restaurants....so if for no other reason, this place deserves a visit just because it is fighting against the chain mentality in PHX.",

It came with black beans which are okay but, not my favorire and rice that was very tasty indeed. I also tried the flan which was excellent. I thought was food was very good and it was also presented beautifully. Yellow rice next to purple cabbage arranged to be pleasing to the eye. The flan had a dollop of whipped cream, a scattering of nuts and carmel sauce drizzled in a zig zag pattern. Food that is tasty and beautiful. I will be going here again.",

The service was good I took some of my customers their a few weeks later for lunch and they loved it also.  This place is a hidden gem I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "So my boyfriend  and I were suppose to go to this restaurant for a friends bday I called the place to get info about the groupon. He didn't know much about it, I asked to speak to the manager or the person who put it up, he then told me he was the owner. So I said well wouldn't you know about the info that is going up on groupon and he hung up on me. So I then blocked my number and called back cause he kept forwarding the calls. So then I told him there was no reason to hang up on me I was just asking why you wouldn't know being the owner. He said no I don't need some little girl telling me how to run my business. I said that's not telling you how to run anything it was a simple question. Nothing wrong at all. He continued to be rude. I said well I guess we won't be having the birthday here and he said well sucks for you then and hung up. There was no reason for his behavior like that towards me. I was very polite and nice the whole time even when he was being rude. I feel if you're running a very expensive restaurant you would know what is on groupon and in fact be nice to customers calling with questions. He was very out of line and I feel the Phoenix area should know how this owner is to customers. I will boycott and encourage others to boycott. He has no respect for his customers. Also I couldn't tell if the owner was a female or male so the \"he\" part may be incorrect, I apologize if that info is incorrect for your future visit there. The reason I choose not to go is because if I'm gonna be treated like that why would they deserve my money, and how will the service be? Horrible first impression. I'll go to the outback and spend $100 on great service",

Also, my food came out on chipped dinnerware that probably should be thrown away.  I think the chef and owner need to think outside the culinary box if they expect to compete with other restaurants in the area. I like to support local businesses but this just didn't cut if for me. Just being honest!",

    "text": "The food here is soooo good!  The first time I came I had to try the chicken chili relleno, as it came so highly recommended. I was not disappointed! It's your basic chili relleno kicked up a notch with the addition of tender pieces of chicken, cheese, onion, and black beans to the filling.  Oh, and it's also GIGANTIC, so come hungry. Although I usually get the chili relleno when I'm here, I've also tried a few other things like the chicken enchiladas. Mmm, chicken, cheese, and a creamy enchilada sauce. So good! The drinks here are also fantastic - I love the sangria, but also enjoy their mojitos. The restaurant itself is so quaint; by that I mean tiny but very nice inside. They do have an outdoor patio, which is great during cooler months and helps with the space issue. Service is quick and attentive. I'm cheap, so I tend to go here for lunch when the prices are a bit lower, but the food is just as delicious.",

Jeff the owner, Kevin (yes you Kevin) were the hosts with the most!! Kevin gave recommendations and was dead on with each course. Jeff was so sweet and checked in on us as well. Fuego has a great patio with a guitarist on Fri/Sat nights. A relaxing fountain added to the atmosphere.  My friend and I started with the House specialty empenadas with ground beef, cumin, garlic, and peppers (I forgot to get pics) and I chose the Pernil Asado Nachos with homemade guacamole  with shredded pork..We also ordered the CUBAN FEAST: Pernil Asado, Ropa Veija, Plantains, Arroz Gondules, and Cuban black beans and seafood enchiladas with cheddar chipotle mashed potatoes and spicy creamed corn. They didn't have the full menu that I saw on line but still had great selections. And for desert the Baked Flourless chocolate torte with dark chocolate chile sauce..All of which got put into a doggie bag for later. The portions were huge. The atmosphere was relaxing. I would go back again...Especially for the mojitos.. Check this place out its a wonderful little hideaway in Central Phoenix.",

I cleaned my plate and didn't have room for dessert. I really like the setting. Far enough off 7th St to not have the traffic noise and with umbrellas and misters it was cool enough to sit outside. Perfect!",

In the back of a little hidden courtyard we found a small 12 table restaurant with a 10 page menu full of exciting cocktails, wines & delicious food.  I was so hungry I didn't even take pictures.  We had the HH Pork Nachos, Tacos, Salmon Croquettes and all was delicious. To finish the meal I enjoyed the Ancho Chile Flourless Chocolate Torte!  Interested to see this place at night time with their live music.",

    "text": "I am very glad that my mom and I weren't deterred by Fuego's sort of hidden location and lack of visible crowd. We had a fantastic dinner this past weekend.   Service was great - enthusiastic and informative.   Mom started with a coconut mojito (one of Fuego's signature cocktails) and I had a glass of white sangria. I don't even like coconut and I thought her drink was delicious.  We shared an order of empanadas as an appetizer, per the recommendation of fellow Yelpers. I don't remember what they were stuffed with but they were good. I could have perhaps used a guac or some kind of dip, but then again I am a condiment freak.   I let our server pick my entree, between their nightly special (a blackened mahi mahi in tomatillo cream sauce) or the short rib. He chose the mahi for me and it was really, really good. All entrees come with your choice of 2 sides and I chose some sauteed green beans and jalapeno creamed corn. The creamed corn was tasty, but definitely had a kick to the aftertaste! Mom got the seafood stuffed chile relleno and let me tell you it was AWESOME. I was super jealous of her entree but she was nice and let me have a bite or three. I would definitely come back just to have that dish. Yum.  I will also be back to check out Fuego's happy hour, which runs Tuesday through Saturday from 3-6pm and includes a bunch of small plates and discounts on booze.",

I had purchased a Living Social certificate, so we decided to try it out one Friday night.  First off, to really enjoy the experience, make sure you request a table on the patio so you can enjoy the nice live guitar music as well.  The entire menu sounded amazing, so it was difficult to narrow down the choices and decide what to enjoy.  I finally settled on the chicken stuffed with spinach, apricots and cheese special with a side of jalapeno cream corn and a green chili cornbread to share with my husband.  He thoroughly enjoyed his pork medallion entree with a side of chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes.  Next time we want to try the feast to taste many different items as it appears you can't go wrong!  We can't wait to go back, so try this place out pronto!",

The menu sounded great and I came for lunch and LOVED my Cuban sandwich - A LOT - but dinner seemed steep.   Came for happy hour and had a top notch mojito and enjoyed delicious sliders. Still, for dinner... I wasn't convinced.   I saw a Groupon but the conditions (must buy 2 entrees) didn't earn any points for me, personally. My friend, however, had a Groupon and suggested we meet here for dinner.   Holy mole! The dinner portions are HUGE. No wonder the prices are what they are. You can easily share an entree - or take home left overs. There must've been a dozen shrimp on my plate. MOUNDS of pork on the other. You get to choose 2 sides and they're all wonderful.   So, to put an end to this long story... do NOT let the dinner prices scare you off. The food is delicious and you get your money's worth, not just in the quality but in the quantity too!",

    "text": "Came here this past Saturday during Phoenix Food Week and got their Pre Fixe special for the event.  It was 30$ and had 3 courses including a free drink choice. Not a shabby deal.  I went with a date and we agreed to get different things so we can sample more of their offerings.  For my drink I got the Blood Orange Mojito.  Supposedly this place is known for their Mojitos, but as a huge fan of Mojitos, I can tell you that the Mojito is simply \"Ok\".  They use Monin syrup for their flavorings so dont expect an actual prickly pear or blood orange in your mojito.  The other drink we got was a Carribean Volcano which was made with SoCo and some other medely...but all I could taste was Pineapple.  Ok so drinks aren't their thing....on to the food.  Course 1:  There was 4-5 things to choose from but the two that caught our eyes were the Salmon Croquette and the Chili Empanada.  From what I hear, the Empanada is also something that Fuego Bistro is known for.  I dont know if maybe I got unlucky but I really did not care for the Empanada.  The shell was crispy and tasty but the beef filling was bland and boring.  The pico de gaio sprinkled on top did not really do anything to the dish either.  In contrast...the Salmon Croquette was amazing...I want to go back and order a whole meal of that! lol.  The salmon was perfectly mixed with the other spices in the Croquette and it was cooked perfectly.  Course 2:  We got the Pernil Asada and the Tilapia.  Both dishes were tasty and I cant say anything bad about them, I also cannot say anything great about them either.  The Tilapia was basically Country Fried with a mild sauce on top and the Pernil Asada was a well executed pulled pork.  Each dish came with 2 sides and I can safely say that the side dishes impressed me more then the main course.  The creamed corn was heavenly, the Mashed Potatoes were delicious and the cornbread was phenomenal....(im out of adjectives, sue me)  The Green Beans were cooked well but needed seasoning...simply adding some salt fixed that problem.  Course 3:  We got the Bread Pudding and the Chocolate Torte.  Both were served with a scoop of ice cream that had chocolate slivers in it.  I gotta say, the bread pudding was awesome...I wish there was more of it, though im sure my waistline is glad there wasent.  I am not a fan of heavy chocolate dishes so the Torte was not for me, but if you ask my date how it was she would probably describe the event as orgasmic...at least thats what it sounded like.",

I was early for my hair appt (Veez, next door) and my stylist was still with her previous client, so I went next door for a happy hour drink.  After perusing the hh menu, I decided on a margarita and the pork nachos. I wasn't hungry, but i am a sucker for pork and nachos... Put em together and seems like a winning combination, right?  Well, it is!! Wow, that pork is so incredibly tasty. It was all I could do not to moan at the bar while I ate them. The chips are good and thick (girth is important ;) ) There was perfect amount of melted cheese, black bean salsa and a nice pile of guacamole on top. I put a serious hurting on them nachos. And my margarita you ask? Fantastic! With salt, on the rocks... Classic. Delish. Perfect accompaniment to the nachos.   I honestly can't remember what I ate on the two previous visits, as they were sometime last year, but I've not been disappointed in the food. On one visit last year, the service was a little slacking, but not enough to keep me from wanting to go back. I think I'll always plan to be early for hair appts now...",

Lot of really good roasted pork!  I opted for beans and rice over fries. Both were nicely seasoned and the rice was good (it can be really bad at some places) Huge portions and our server was super friendly and relaxed and kept my water glass filled.   Desserts all sounded to heavy.  Might be nice to go in the evening and have coffee and something.

    "text": "I have been to this place about 3 times now.  Although I do enjoy the outdoor dining, lights, nice music, etc. this last time was not so good.  Maybe this was because it was a Friday?? The place was very busy and although we got seated fairly quickly it was at a table situated above an overhead mister which dripped water on me throughout my meal.  I managed to maneuver around the problem so it would not hit my head or food.  I have to admit, it  sort of surprised me that the establishment was not aware of this problem.  At any rate, I did not mention it to the staff until much later in my meal and I did not ask to be moved since I managed a \"work around\" the problem.  The music that evening was louder than the previous evenings.  I personally prefer music to be an undertone when I am dining.  Don't get me wrong, the music was good, I just hate having to raise my voice to be heard over dinner which is the last thing I feel like doing on a Friday evening toward my significant other.  I am starting to question the food here  -- the fact that it comes out so quickly makes me feel like I am being served fast food and the prices do not reflect that. Perhaps it's the ambiance we pay for.  The dessert we shared was, in our opinion, not so good even though we ate it but who has not eaten something they thought was not that great??  If we all did that, how would that change dining out?  Everybody has different taste buds and dietary concerns as well.",

I had the short ribs and was wowed by the sweet/savory tender meat and the delicious cheddar mashed potatoes that came with the entree. The serving sizes of all the food was so ample, I mis-judged the capacity of my stomach and overate. The service was fine that night. I remember our waitress being very acommodating and prompt. We sat in the pleasant, quiet patio area and had a really nice dinner.   I went back with my husband a month or so later after telling him how good it was. This time, I ordered the nightly special, a grilled tuna dish. The tuna itself was fine, actually seemed like a high quality piece of fish. My criticism was that they served a large piece of tuna unsliced. It made the fish kind of chewy because I had to cut off large pieces with a less-than-ideal steak knife.   So, the worst part was that the service was poor enough that even I was annoyed. We sat and waited for our dishes to be cleared and our bill to be presented for probably 20-30 minutes. I'm usually pretty tolerant of mediocre service, but man! If it was like this every time, I would definitely have to avoid the place even though I like the food. I plan to give it another go, hoping the poor service was a fluke.",

Between the old gurgling fountain, colorful christmas lights, old trees and flowering coriander plants, my girlfriend and I quite enjoyed the offbeat decore. Not your typical bistro spot.   The waitstaff were attentive and friendly, especially our waiter, a young dude who's name escapes me. He answered my celiac girlfriend's questions courteously, and was mild mannered and easy-going in a way that really suited the environs. Happy hour menu looked great, and the house marg and mojito were both fresh, simple and tasty.  GF got mussels and a street tacos, with the mussels being right up there with the best she had, and the tacos fresh, tasty and clean.  My main course was the Soy & Cola braised short-ribs with something-something au-jus, I opted for the mashed potatoes and maple chile glazed carrots as sides. At this point, i was feeling like, while the drinks were good, and the atmosphere & service was quirky, natural and relaxed, I wasn't totally expecting the food to blow me away - I was wrong. The dish was both incredibly well balanced and delicious (and very healthy portions at that). Spicy, rich and fall apart tender meat, with gentle touches of sweet, fruity, savory and spicy. The potatoes were addicting, and the carrots (being from Vermont, and a maple lover, i know that maple can be a difficult thing to cook with) were not over sweet, but perfectly tender, buttery, a touch of salt and heat.  All in all a great, friendly and offbeat dining experience. We'll be back.",

    "text": "We really like Fuego Bistro. It has one of the best patios in Phoenix, the staff and host are awesome, and the food is spot on. They have a great wine list and the short ribs is one of the best dishes in Phoenix. When the little lady and I dine at Fuego, we always share the short ribs and the pork. For sides, I get the cornbread and mashed tatters, she gets the tatters and green beans. The one downside is this is what we always get. We really like this combo, but we haven't really found anything else we like. We have tried almost all their other entrees, and several specials but haven't found anything we would order again. With that said, I would recommend the short ribs to anybody, anytime, over most all other Phoenix restaurants.",

That was just the beginning of the bad experience...we were going to leave but I had bought a voucher from Amazon Local and because of the time they wouldst except it I talked to the owner who was very rude and didn't want to give away food even though I paid for my voucher......Will never go back there again.....Amazon did refund my money",

    "text": "We went to dinner at Fuego Bistro last week.  It was a great night to sit out on the patio and have ourselves a quiet dinner with some delicious food.  If you've never been here before, its' tucked away off the street so it might be a little hard to find.  It's outdoor seating is set in a courtyard with indoor seating set in the building behind it.  We walked up to the hostess who was very warm and welcoming and she asked if we had a reservation.  We didn't, but she was still able to accommodate us.  She sat us next to the water fountain which was very relaxing.  We then were promptly greeted by our waitress who was extremely nice and a little playful.  I really liked that.  We ordered our drinks and then perused the menu.  We placed our order...  I had to do it. I had to have the Cola & Pineapple Soy Braised Angus Short Rib Roast.  When I got this, it was like heaven met earth!  SO tender and flavorful!  With your meal you are able to order 2 sides.  I had to have the cornbread and mashed potatoes.  The cornbread is amazing! So moist and the texture isn't like traditional cornbread.  The potatoes too were so yummy, I couldn't' stop eating them.  Yes my plate was pretty much a carb-fest, but sometimes you just have to do it.     If you're in the area, check them out sometime.  I know on the weekends they can get pretty busy, so maybe make a reservation to be safe.",

    "text": "Finally made it to this hidden gem...have to go back and check if anyone else had to search for it. The fact that it is inside the courtyard of the complex threw us off for a couple of minutes. Liked that we had to hunt for it a bit!  This is a place where once you start eating, you want to fast forward to the next day so you can try something else on the menu.  Dined off the happy hour menu.  First, if you order a salad of the HH menu....it is the big dinner salad, so be advised....you will get filled up! Jeannie and I each had different salads and they were both very good.  The downside was that we could not gorge ourselves on the other good stuff .   BBQ pernil sliders & tilipia tacos....too hard to call one the winner.  Will require a rematch or two....  Will be coming back until we get through the entire menu!...at least a couple times.  Happy hour means drinks and the bistro did not disappoint here either. Jeannie went with a well liked sangria and I tossed back two margaritas. Very picky about my margaritas and this was a good one. They do use a bottled pre-mix, which I didn't recognize, but it was neither too sweet or sour...the death knell of a good marg and a waste of a shot of tequila.  P.S. Was in Costco two days later and saw a gift card offer.... $49.99 for  $100 in gift cards! They are good at all three locations. Guess you know what we are buying!",

    "text": "There is nothing more exciting than trying a new restaurant without any huge expectations and being blown away. I was celebrating my gf's b-day week and we decided to check out Fuego Bistro. Thank goodness we found this place, the experience from beginning to end was flawless. You can tell immediately that the food is made with love, every single thing we ordered was absolutely flavorful. We started with their cornbread 1/2 portion, personally I didn't eat it as it contains bacon and I don't do meat but my gf said it was the best cornbread she's ever had. For our entrees we ordered from the \"small plates\" section as we wanted to definitely save room for dessert. I ordered the fish tacos and she ordered the Peasant paella. My tacos: OMG, 1 bite in and it was love. They use 2 tortillas to make sure you have a good hold of all the good stuff and nothing falls out. Mind you, they are full of good stuff. Let's just say if the fish was missing, I wouldn't care, everything in this taco was magical! Did you hear me, magical I say (I don't use this word often for food mind you). I will DEFINITELY be ordering their tacos again. I liked that as a pescatarian they had veggie options as well. Black beans: I'm cuban guys, we live off black beans as it's a staple in the cuban culture. OH man, these beans tasted just as good if not better than what my family made growing up. They are legit, tasty, unbelievable black beans! Totally unexpected to love them so much but like I said, made with love. Glazed carrots: Damn, best carrots ever! If a restaurant's sides are this good, you won't be able to wait for your entree and dessert! Peasant paella: One of the best paella's she's ever had, and this is a dish she grew up eating made by spaniards. It did look great with a perfect balance or rice to meat ratio and delectable flavors. Mind you we both felt for the \"small plates\" the portions were plentiful and filling. Then for dessert we opted on the berry empanadas with pineapple icecream on top. WOW! One bite in, again that magical dreamlike experience in your mouth. Absolutely made with love, from scratch with tons of berries. I wouldn't have changed 1 single thing from our entire dining experience. Now, the service. It was slow when we went, about 8ish on a weekday. We were greeted right away with a smile from our lovely server and another server which was nearby also gave us great service such as refilling our waters, offering suggestions on some food items and picking up our empty dishes. I LOVE getting great service, being in the food industry in the past it is just AWESOME when a restaurant gets it right. We visited several restaurants (all very different cuisines) during my gf's birthday week and I must say, Fuego bistro won hands down best meal of the week. It was such an awesome experience I would've paid twice as much for our meal because man, it was just that good. This doesn't happen to us that often, to be THIS pleased with an overall dining experience in every possible way. Well, guess what Fuego bistro? Not only will we most definitely be coming back, but you've made our list of places to take all our out of town guests to knowing they too will have an amazing mouthwatering experience. Thank you so much for having such an attentive staff, cozy but inviting atmosphere and ridiculously great food. Much appreciated.",

    "text": "Tried this place for the first time last night.  Expiring groupon coupons will force you to do it, NOW!  It was early,  so getting a table wasn't a problem, or parking (small parking lot, can definitely see it as a problem finding a place once it gets crowded).  We were greeted by a lovely hostess and given the option of indoor or outdoor, we chose indoors - cozy place with tables somewhat close in proximity to each other....I can tell you what they were talking about at each table around us- \"I would have left him too if he acted like that\" LOL!!    Our server was very nice, answered all our questions, we told her we were first timers, and she educated us on the menu and made some suggestions - which were fabulous!  Drinks were delish (red sangria for both my hubby and I) and then we ordered the salmon croquets (so good), entrees my husband had the pulled pork, and I had the enchiladas - both very good and plentiful.  My only negatives are these   1) food came too fast, we had just started to enjoy our drinks when the appetizer arrived, I like to enjoy my drink a bit before I start eating, didn't happen had to start on my croquets NOW, then half way through our croquets, here comes our entrees  - I felt rushed and don't like that my food has to sit on the side and wait till i'm done with my appetizer (it was simply too good to let go and we were paying for it).   2) Had a hard time distinguishing staff from customers, not that i want to see uniforms on staff but wasn't sure if the lady with the coat was just taking food to & from random tables ...and there was a guy that kept rubbing girls shoulders (on staff masseuse perhaps) just give me something that helps me determine who's who   3) kinda pricey...here's an idea scale back the portions and adjust the price.  Portions are LARGE - but I don't think enchiladas should cost $27.00, and pulled pork $25.00.  Salmon croquets (2) $14.00 - come on man...... (we chose sides of mashed potatoes and corn bread, my husband had cornbread and green beans).  Didn't save room for dessert and we just couldn't finish the meal...too much, saving it for the next day.",

    "text": "This is the second time we have been here via GROUPON. This time we sat on the patio. I highly recommend the patio seating. Even this time of year where out evenings get pretty cold, they have the heaters working. I had to take my jacket off. The heaters made the patio area the perfect temperature for enjoying eating outside on the patio. This is a Saturday night so live music is playing. What a wonderful time. We are warmly greeted and quickly seated. We had a reservation, and I'd recommend you have one as well. This place packs up. With a GROUPON you must get an entree. Although you are getting $30 off the bill, it does limit you as to what you can get. Next time we are going without the coupon so we can try the other many non entree items on the menu. I had the short rib enchilada with a mole sauce. It was wonderful. My wife had the seafood Chili Relleno. It was also an amazing dish. Sangria's are great. And the mixed berry empanada for dessert was a great finish along with a french press coffee. If I could give more than 5 stars I would.",

Great outdoor seating in the courtyard with numerous different size tables. We came without a reservation on a busy Saturday night  and were seated within 10 minutes! Everybody was very kind and super nice. The place was very busy but you can immediately notice the stuff was working as a team, checking on everybody and bringing the food out with a smile. It felt like I was in my Latin friends house! The courtyard is so cozy and has local art! We ordered 3 different tapas! Let me tell you - they are perfect sharing size ! We were so full. You might think the restaurant is pricey but I believe you get what you pay for. It was certainly worth the bill!Excellent food! Great wine! And not to mention live music! Good live music. Not over the top... not loud... just a great place for either a romantic date or friends gathering! Love -love -love Fuego Bistro! Phoenix food scene has great future!",

    "text": "Saturday night lead us to Fuego .The location is near a very up and coming booming area with other great restaurants and bars. Luckily we didn't drive , as this place is tucked away and was tricky to find at night! Upon reading the menu, that's part of its charm:'hidden' , 'secret hideaway' &'tucked away'. We had reservations & were seated in the courtyard. The hostess, who was on her cell phone, decided to seat us at a far back table in the patio , ( other tables for two were available near the live music ). The patio is charming with iron tables & a fountain.  The live music, though not Latin, was a nice romantical touch. Here is where the issue begins & it would follow thru the evening :service. We waited a good 13 minutes for anyone to greet us &take a drink order. When I asked to see the wine list  as the drink menu has a quip at the bottom and I quote , 'a library of unique and quirky wines is also available', response given to me from our waiter was, 'What is it that you are looking for? The bartender just keeps different wines back there.' I looked at him so confused, because I was. I asked for a sparkling wine & was told ,'Oh no, yeah , we don't have that, just these', as he points again to the wines listed on the menu. Okay, confused I may be, but I can bend & clearly this waiter was not interested in explaining why the wine menu said there 'may' be more! So, I ordered the Remix Sangria, a mix of red and white wine sangria. It came with fresh fruit & not too sweet. Perusing the menu for the next 20 minutes (yes 20!) we found a lot of items we wanted to order! The menu is very Latin with classics like Empanadas & Croquettes. We ordered the Empanadas & Sauteed Prawns. These two orders were HUGE! The empanadas are like 'turnover' size! They were full of ground beef, cheese, peppers and so much goodness! The prawns were so delicious: two sauces divide the plate for a nice presentation: a green tomatillo sauce and a chipotle chile sauce that's sweeter and down the middle of both: mango and avocado chutney! This was a great dividing balance for the spice of the shrimp. I truly wanted more of the mango chutney. It was chunky and fresh! My entree choice was the Pernil Asado: authentic Latin slow roasted pork served with orange habanero mojo & corn tortillas. Again, HUGE entrees! My husband had the Short Rib Enchiladas : a sweet flavor of cola & pineapple over the tender short rib and Oaxacan cheese stuffed into tortillas and topped with more of the cola sauce. It tasted much like a sweet mole to me. Very tender and rich. The entrees come with TWO sides. There is an abundance of sides to choose from. I had a Fuego Salad that was said to be 'small'; its full size! I also ordered the Black Beans. My husband is a carb king! He ordered the Green Chile Cornbread ( the size of a hand!) & the Chipotle Mashed Potatoes. Now for the big, fat negative: The only thing on my plate that was hot were the black beans. My tortillas were literally cold to the touch. The pork , although amazing in taste, was lukewarm. The mojo, barely warm at all. The salad was served when the meal came. Pet peeve. We also had now ran out of water and drinks. We flagged down a bus boy, ( seemingly the only one working on a busy Saturday night, & a hostess who would not put her cell phone down! ) who would bring a water pitcher out and fill a table next to us; go drop the pitcher & he's done! I asked for lemon ; never got it. The busser got our server to take our drink orders , who then sent a runner with my second sangria but forgot my husbands beer. She came back a few minutes later with it; in a Latin restaurant, water is needed! THAT said , I wasn't going to send my food back for a heating up. It may have taken another twenty minutes to get! There were only two small corn tortillas with my meal. We just never saw the waiter & again, the hostess never helped anyone. We ordered the Ancho Chile Chocolate Torte to share from  our waiter who finally showed up, only because it was so unique sounding, in fact, many of the desserts are. I can not have walnuts so they were put into a small ramekin for my husband. We think this is where the 'chile' taste was in the torte , although he said it was slight. Otherwise , the torte, albeit very good, was just a chocolate flourless torte , IMO. The sauce was amazing & the Malted Ice Cream was unique! I would have loved an after dinner coffees .. but we weren't asked so, that is that. All said, great  food , but the service and unprofessionalism of the staff (taking drinks after being off to the front to gossip ??) are def things that make me rethink a return. Social Hour looks amazing with many apps & drinks for $6-7! The Latin Sampler for dinner would also be a great way to sample a lot of Latin dishes for $32.95 pp (you can not use a cert for this or Social Hour). NO one wants to pay a premium for lackluster/uncaring service. 5stars-Food 1Star-staff",

    "text": "We've eaten at Fuego at least a half dozen times and it is always excellent food. The menu used to have an amazing cornbread covered in pork roast yum that was always recommended as a specialty. Then, it was gone. When we asked about it, our server and the chef was always happy to accommodate and make it as they have the ingredients.  But today was a very different experience at Fuego. I feel compelled to leave a review on here in the hopes that a manager or owner will see our concerns. Our server (Sarah) gave us grief at every turn today. When we asked about our favorite dish, she made it sound like it would be a huge inconvenience to make it, but that \"she'd ask.\" (It came out and was delicious.) When we got our bill we were given grief about using our Groupon because the cornbread was on the dinner menu, not the lunch menu (and has the price to match!). We assured her that we'd used a lunch Groupon many other times with no trouble. \"Well, we already made an exception by making it and I don' think you can use your Groupon, but I'll ask.\"  She mentioned the huge exception one last time when she dropped off the bill.  Sheesh. Server to server -- just say \"no problem.\" There's no manger out there that is NOT going to accommodate a more expensive meal or a pre-paid Groupon. We've met the owner of Fuego before, and he's awesome -- once offered to buy us dessert because we knew a mutual friend.  Across the street there are two new restaurants that had a steady stream of customers we watched while we ate on an empty patio. Customer service is the first thing that will drive away customers. If our experience today is any indication, I can imagine why they're not coming to Fuego.",

    "text": "Had an appointment right around the corner so we  went here yesterday for dinner after seeing good reviews.   The entrance to this establishment is a little confusing. You have two options. A side or  front entry. Either way it's awkward cause you have to walk through the tables of patrons eating to get to the host to get seated.  The tortilla soup had a nice strong kick to it. Probably the boldest in flavor I've had. Wished I had got a bowl.  The seafood chile relleno had a great presentation but unfortunately it wasn't quite hot in temperature and the flavors didn't seem to distinguish themselves as much as I'd hoped.  The side of jalapeno corn had good flavor but the jalapeno was missing.  Bread pudding for desert it was decent.  Our experience wasn't bad but not close to spectacular either. All in all I was expecting a little more seeing 4.5 stars. Personally I would give a 3.5.  Nice atmosphere, we sat outside. Live music was being set up as we were leaving.",

They provided my group of 4 a standby table while our table was being prepared.  With the space heaters, my friends and I was quite comfortable.  The servers were polite and friendly. They were trained well.  Food was simply amazing. I can understand why it has such a high score....I am contributing.  Live music was the cherry on top. Wasn't too loud. We had a great and cozy time.  Definitely be back!",

    "text": "It's patio weather people!! So of course I had to come and sit on the cutest little patio of Fuego Bistro. It was my husband and I's second wedding anniversary. And I thought it would be a nice romantic setting for the 2 of us. And sure enough it was. With the live music playing on the patio with us, to the pretty lights hanging above us, green sounding us, cobble stone beneath us, and sexy Latin food and drink in front of us. It was pretty much what I was hoping for. My only complaint would be the service. It took about 10-15 minutes for someone to come great our table. There were other tables that got sat after us that were greeted by their server. I am not really sure where ours was at the time, but I'm just going with he had an emergency bathroom break or something. It was just odd to me as the busser and hostess standing in the middle of everything sat and watched us sit there that long with out saying something. But, Once our server arrived everything went very smoothly.   We started off with 2 of their signature cocktails and the Salmon Croquettes - Salmon With Bacon, Onion, & Mashed Potato,Dusted With Ancho Chile, Pan Fried & Topped With A Lemon Caper Beurre Blanc Sauce. Oh man.... I do believe I will make those my meal next time. Perfectly seared, and that Lemon Caper Beurre Blanc Sauce... just amazing.   For our Entree we ended up splitting Pernil Asado - Their Signature Slow Roasted Succulent Pork,Served With An Orange Habanero Mojo & Local Corn Tortillas, with the Green Chili Cornbread Casserole, and the Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes. And boy was it plenty. Not only were we unable to fit dessert, we couldn't finish the plate. Everything had great flavor. I really enjoyed the Pork. Tender and juicy.   Thank you Fuego for making our anniversary night so great. We will be seeing you again soon.",

    "text": "Absolutely loved sitting out on the beautiful patio.  The live music was wonderful and the atmosphere is really top notch.  The service was very good, we had someone come by pretty frequently to fill up waters, check to see if we needed anything, etc.  We enjoyed the margaritas - they were generous in size and didn't skimp on the tequila which is always nice.  Unfortunately there are some areas that could use some attention. Making a reservation is a pain.  Once you call the restaraunt you learn through the recorded message that you have to text a seperate number (not listed on the website).  Due to how busy the place is, it can be a bit before you get a reply, which I totally understand, but it would be really nice if there was an online reservation system or a person you could talk to.    We found the food itself to be mixed.  We both really enjoyed the short rib enchiladas (the mole is beautiful and the ribs are tender) but thought that Fuego Pasta was just OK and overpriced for what it was.  The mushrooms in the dish didn't work for us and I can't say that we felt a pasta dish needed to be served in a tortilla and then topped with fried tortilla strips.  We also tried the Horchata Bread Pudding and were a little disapointed that we couldn't taste the horchata and found it to be a little dry.  All portions were really generous, you will not leave hungry.  Overall I think there are places at this price point that have more consistent food but you won't find a better patio for a Saturday night dinner.",

    "text": "Holy crap.... What a waste of time and money! I should have listened to the previous commenters. Such a disaster and so unprofessional.  We went here on last night (Saturday night), got a sitter, got the Groupon, and wanted a great meal. Ya know, the whole bit. It's the first time we had been out in a while so our expectations were high, especially for the stars and detailed reviews on here. We pulled up and there wasn't enough parking. We found parking down the street and walked through the side entrance. We passed five separate staff members and not one said \"Hello\" or even acknowledged us. We obviously looked lost and yet had no idea where to go.  We found our way up to the stand and the host called me \"Boss\" every time and was very unprofessional. We were seated right away outside and were seated on a slanted table and chairs. It took at least 10 minutes for the server to come out and greet us. She was at first interested in us, but once we mentioned the Groupon, she told us the terms of the Groupon and disappeared.  We ordered an appetizer, The Tour de Fuego. The Salmon Croquette was dry, flaky, and had overbearing taste with the capers on top. The Empanada (the popular item that everyone raves about) was overcooked and had a very strange sauce on top. The veggie tostada is a joke. The highlight of the meal...and I mean the whole meal was the Cubano Sliders.  We were sitting outside for this meal and were extremely parched. We had to ask for refills from just about everyone else but our waitress. She was no where to be found. Once she finally returned, we had some questions about the menu but she seemed less than interested in going through the menu with us. She was put-off with our questions.  We asked for recommendations on the entrees, we were pitched the Pernil Asado and the Short Rib Enchiladas. The Pernil Asado came out dry. There were hard pieces of pork and hardly any flavor. Worst part was they only included two small, and I mean SMALL tortillas with the plate. For $25 I would expect a hell of a lot more than that! My wife ordered the Short Rib Enchiladas had an overbearing Mole sauce that just made her gag. I thought it was because she's 8 months pregnant but I tried it and found it to be overbearing. The meal comes out like mush and leaves much to be desired. In addition to the disappointing food, our sides were wrong and the whole experience was a disaster.   To end the disaster we tried paying with our Groupon, which we showed to the waitress upon arrival. She looked at the Groupon again and straight up told us that she couldn't accept it. We didn't meet the terms of the Groupon. We asked for clarification and she told us that we had to order Four Entrees after she just told us that we had to order Two Entrees. WHAT THE EFF? I sat there asking her what she could do and all she could say was that I could order two more entrees or settle the bill and leave.THIS IS NOT HOW YOU TREAT YOUR GUESTS. THIS IS EXTORTION!   I won't ever return and won't even pawn this Groupon off to the next person. DO NOT GO HERE! Go somewhere were they know how to cook, know how to treat people and will anticipate your needs. The value isn't there and what you pay for is not what you get. If you want to feel like another number or to feel forgotten about throughout the meal, come to Fuego Bistro.   Oh and Mr. Owner, your snarky comments to reviewers shows just how pathetic this establishment is. Oh, and fire your staff!",

The seafood chile relleno was ok.  Too much sauce drowned out the flavor for me.   String bean side were simple but good.   Mashed potatoes are good.  Mahi mahi special was good on flavor.   The maple glazed carrots and the corn bread are AWSOME.   The bread wasn't as hot as I liked though.     Here is the best part of the night.   STACY was Awsome.    She was a server I don't think but she was incredible.   Personable, lively, fun, friend, and she was hustling to take care of the table all night.   She was the best part of the night.  By far she made the experience   The live music was Awsome.  The guitarist had great music selection.   Although he was Awsome the music was a great variety of classic rock, country, current hits, there was no Latin music to keep with the theme of the restaurant.   I would have liked something Latin sprinkled into the mix during the time we were there.",

The owner is friendly, the ambiance is soft and super pleasant--even romantic if you want it to be, and did I mention the food?  A group of us went here for Restaurant Week.  SO HAPPY we did.  I had the cola and pineapple braised short ribs, the green lipped mussels, and the horchata bread pudding, along with a berry sangria.  The short ribs were amazing and a good portion.  the flavors balanced beautifully and the meat melted in my mouth.  Oh, and the sides?  The corn bread casserole was enough to make me cry for joy. the mussels had blue cheese and fresh tomatoes on top, and were good enough to be a meal on their own.  I would never have thought blue cheese and mussels could be so amazing together. The bread pudding?  Not so great.  However, I tried the key lime pie and I wished I had ordered it so I could take it home and roll around in it like a happy puppy.  Holy moly, was that key lime pie crazy delicious!  Fuego Bistro is top notch.  Loses one star because while I was there, my chair got kicked by passing waiters and busboys ELEVEN times.  Three of those times  the chair was kicked so hard I was smacked into the table.  Not exaggeration.  If they had not been packed, I would have insisted on being moved elsewhere.",

Atmosphere: It's tucked off a main road in a quaint little plaza strung w/ festive lights and has ample outdoor seating with heating lamps. There's live music (not sure if it's every day, but lucky it was going on at dinner time) and the musicians are so talented.  Food: The Travelzoo voucher is probably the best bang for your buck. I tried the blackberry sangria (highly recommend), and a little bit of everything -- I mean everything. Pernil, mashed potatoes, jalapeno biscuits, chorizo penne pasta, corn, salmon croquettes. Super flavorful! I don't think there was an item I disliked.  Service: Amazing! I think this is what really did it. The hostess is so bubbly and the waiter is genuinely nice (sorry I don't remember their names, but previous posts mention them as well so you know they're consistent).  Zero complaints for this place. Very glad I stumbled upon it!",

The apple crown royal concoction Steve made me was good, as well as the Jamaican Mai Tai, but the guava mojito was so-so (not enough liquor lol) I ordered the seafood Chile Relleno with maple glazed carrots and jalapeno cream corn. All of it was delicious but I think the crust of the chile relleno was too thick and too much so I just ate the inside lol. The boyfriend got enchiladas with green beans and chipotle mash as the sides and it was all yummy!  A couple got engaged next to us which was cool.  Oh we also ordered the chocolate Torte which was decent.   We used out Living social deal ($10 for $30 can be used any day for dinner between the times of 5-9pm for a party of 2 or more buying 2 entrees, Groupon is $13 for $30 ) which helped with our hefty bill!  Our overall experience there was great!  P.S. The patio is beautiful and a bit romantic with the hanging lights all over",

We happened to stop in during restaurant week, and we barely got through the 1st course and we were full! Everything is good. The only thing that we were not a big fan on is the Salmon Croquette appetizer. Otherwise... Everything is very flavorful and full of spices! I am excited to come back!

I got thePanko crusted Tipalia which was a little dry, but my girlfriend's stuffed mahi mahi was delicious.  The Horchata bread pudding was really good too.  They have a nice patio where most of the customers sit, I will be bringing my dog with me next time.    It is a bit expensive, so be prepared to drop some money, but it's definitely worth checking out.",

    "text": "Just had my father's 70th birthday. They customed our meal to my parents' likings. We started with croquets and salad Which were delicious. Though the salad included walnuts...of which I'm not the biggest fan, the croquets were flakey and the meat was seasoned well. The main dishes included a Panko fried, thickly cut tilapia that was covered in a semi spicy pepper sauce, pernil asada that is HANDS DOWN the best pulled pork I could ask for, spiced mashed potatoes (against my diet but well worth the splurge), green beans and a pasta dish that I was too stuffed to try (and my carbs were already high). I tried a bite of the cheese cake which was awesome. The chocolate chip horchata bread was creative but not to my liking, but I also have an extremely high standard for anything sweet.   The service was superb! They were well trained and deserving of big tips. They didn't get in the way but were very pleasant at the same time.  Great left overs. I'm looking forward to lunch. The chef has really matured in quality over the past 5 years since my first review, and even then they were a 4 star restaurant in my book.   All 24 of us had a great time.",

    "text": "Ok first time here with a groupon. The deal was good for $ paid vs. $ you get . Thank god because the dishes were expensive, but we aren't yelping groupon.  Ok let's start the review  First we could find the place. They are located down an alley like street with no signs indicating their location. After circling and then making a phone call we see a wrought iron sign indicating their location down in a courtyard. Although we arrived shortly after 5 (beginning of dinner service) we were told if we didn't have a reservation we could only sit outside. Well since we had already drOve all the way across town over 20 miles I wasn't turning back now. So we opted to sit outside. It was shady but come on this is phoenix and it didn't take long Til I was dabbing my forehead with sweat.   We were given a menu and ice water. We had restrictions to our Voucher and had to order two dinner entrees which started at 21.00.  We started out with a beer and a reposado margarita. The margarita was small! They also used table salt instead of margarita salt. I had salt running down the cup everywhere.  Then we ordered two of the same dinner entrees. The panko crusted chicken breasts with two sides. I chose the cheddar mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans. My husband had glazed carrots instead of potatoes.  I felt like our food was Luke warm and my plate was chipped.  Our bill was almost $60 and I could have fed a family of 6 the same food at the same price.  They get rave reviews for their happy hour which may be \"great\" but our dinner certainly was subpar.",

I would blame it mostly on our terrible service from our waitress. We saw her a total of maybe four times (we had to ask other people for more drinks, water, and to bring us our food) in an hour and a half time period. After wAiting 45 minutes after we ordered, we finally asked someone else about our food since our waitress was no where to be found and they brought it to us right away but unfortunately it was cold so it's hard to leave a review on the True quality of the food. I would imagine it would be pretty good if brought to you right away. Spending $100 on dinner for 2 people I would just expect our server to actually bring us our food and more sangria when we are done within a reasonable time frame, especially on a slow night. The other servers were awesome though for picking up her lack of service. I won't be returning.",

    "text": "07/05/12   Had two Voice Daily Deals ($10 for $30) to use up before the 14th, so I asked my young cousin to meet me for dinner.  I'd never eaten here before, but I know from the reviews that it's popular for happy hour.  Indeed, the HH menu sounds fantastic, and so do the prices.  However, these certificates were only good for dinner, and so here we were.  But first, about the location-- it's tucked away a bit, away from the road, so don't blink, or you might miss it.  There are many parking spaces, so that's not an issue unless you're there for HH.  (If you are, then come early.)  FB has a small patio area that looks promising, if only it was decorated a little better.  I remember seeing two tables, but cousin remembers four.  I don't think there are misters to help keep cool.  Inside, it's even smaller.  I would say about six tables of two- and four-tops, and about five to six seats at the beautiful blue-tiled bar.  Sit here to maximize on atmosphere, have questions about the wines or cocktails, and if you want to be entertained by the staff.  My cousin doesn't drink, so she had water, while I tried the guava mojito.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=pCA97HLAPYRN0bJTQUs1Pw#pCA97HLAPYRN0bJTQUs1Pw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvN...</a>  It tasted like a regular mojito, but a bit sweeter.  It's alright- nothing fantastic.  Maybe I'll try a regular one, without the added flavorings, during HH one of these days.  After poring through the menu and asking our server Steve (who is also the bartender) about the dinner special (ribeye), I found I could only try ONE item, since everything else had allergens all over the entrees (shellfish, corn, guacamole, bell peppers, dijon reduction, etc.), instead of just added on top, and so I ordered the Natural Farm Chicken Breast, with tomatillo sauce, pico de gallo, goat cheese, and bacon. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=o8X2VwUplwqRZfvuQUunDA#o8X2VwUplwqRZfvuQUunDA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvN...</a>  My cousin ordered the ribeye special, with mushrooms and a dijon reduction.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=fMtwu_Aw8ynU-gaOspzWWQ#fMtwu_Aw8ynU-gaOspzWWQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvN...</a>  Entrees come with your choice of two sides from the following choices: green chile cornbread casserole, jalapeno creamed corn, sauteed organic green beans, chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes, and maple-glazed carrots.  Cousin chose the cornbread and creamed corn, and I asked for the green beans and mashed potatoes.  Cousin LOVED everything on her plate!  She especially liked the cornbread.  I enjoyed my dish, as well.  I liked how spicy it was, which may turn some people off, but I thought everything worked well together, especially the addition of the goat cheese, which helped to cut the spiciness.  I say add more cheese!  Loved the bacon bits, as well.  The green beans were sauteed to perfection-- nice green color and crisp, and not greasy.  We both thought the mashed potatoes were very tasty!  It's a good thing I liked the dish, since it's the only one I can order, unless they offer something new as a special.    We were too stuffed to order dessert, and it's a good thing, too, since out of the five choices (Ancho chocolate torte, Banana burrito, Kahlua creme brulee, Horchata bread pudding, and Homemade Key Lime pie), I could only have the brulee, and I wasn't feeling like creme brulee that evening.    Prices were too high for me to consider dining here for dinner without a discount.  Now, it's one thing if the menu is all-organic, but it isn't.  Service was attentive and friendly, so that's a plus.  Loved the intimate setting, but only if I can sit at the bar- we sat at a table.  07/12/12  Came back solo to use up the second certificate.  This time I sat at the lovely blue-tiled bar, even though the seat wasn't too comfortable, especially after leaving a massage session...  It was great fun speaking with bartender Steve and server Kevin.  \"T-Bone\" was nice, too -- he always made sure to open the door for guests.  Had the chicken breast again <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=P_dIQjZufh2dJ6m_rjYmTA#P_dIQjZufh2dJ6m_rjYmTA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvN...</a>, with a glass of sauvignon blanc, and the Kahlua creme brulee.  The chicken is as good as I remembered it, but this time there was even less goat cheese!  However, the creme brulee made up for it.  The best part of the dessert were the caramel and chocolate sauces that accompanied it.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=tmq5bH42X_to8nG9fuT6yg#tmq5bH42X_to8nG9fuT6yg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvN...</a>  Mmm!  I'd like to have these over ice cream, but not the Thrifty ice cream that accompanies many of the dessert plates offered here.  (Sorry, but I cannot have products that use corn syrup.  Besides, I'd rather have ice cream made from high-quality ingredients, and carrageenan and corn syrup, high fructose or otherwise, aren't.)  Thanks for honoring the Voice Daily Deals, FB!  I'll be back with family and friends for happy hour, maybe.",

Excited to have drinks and dinner we made our way over after shopping in Scottsdale.  At first since it was dark the streets seemed a bit sketchy but as soon as we walked in the place was magical.  There were lights strung across the courtyard and live music playing in the restaurant.  There was limited seating indoors but the weather was pleasant so we sat outside.  The service was a bit slow and the dim to no lighting made it hard to read the menu but once we were able to see what we were ordering I decided to have the Fuego Seafood Chile Relleno : a signature dish; scallop,shrimp, and Mahi Mahi stuffed in a jumbo Pasilla pepper with a panko crust and a lobster chile cream sauce.  The food made the extra star on the rating.  Amazing and fullfilling to the max! The Chile was full of flavor and the side dishes could have easily been a dish on their own! The corn bread puts any other corn bread to shame and the mashed potatoes were the perfect creamy and extra kick with cajun flavor.  I'm glad we had this groupon otherwise would never had made our way to this hidden gem.",

A bit difficult to find since there aren't any signs. It's tucked in between a dance studio & a hair salon. The patio is a big open courtyard shade by large trees and a nice ambiance from the bubbling fountain and music. They have live music ever weekend.

Now we have probably been 12 or more times, sometimes for full dinner with friends others just to sit at the bar and nibble appetizers.  If you're expecting white tablecloths or unusual architecture, you will be disappointed but the quirkiness of this place is its charm.  The menu is extensive and we have yet to try anything that was not to our liking. I would call the prices reasonable and in-line with restaurants we regularly eat at. The drink list is extensive and Steve, the bartender, very personable.  At their busiest, service has always been good to excellent. And now when we show up we are greeted like family. And then there's the live music.  Check out their menu and give them a try!",

Fuego Bistro isn't the newest and flashiest place in our neighborhood, but it's one of the best! The food is so savory and delicious and the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. My favorite is the pork medallions and my wife loves the seafood chile relleno. And you HAVE to get the cornbread and creamed corn! We've dined at Fuego 5 or 6 times now and we've never been disappointed. You feel like you're dining with family. Their staff is amazing! They have great line music every night. Tonight was our anniversary and we wanted to be somewhere where we could sit back and enjoy a little conversation with each other with a nice romantic backdrop. Fuego was the perfect choice. You guys are exceptional! Thanks for doing what you do for our neighborhood.",

    "text": "Wow.  What a memorable dining experience; if I could give six stars, I would.  This gem is hidden from the street and you wouldn't know it was there if it weren't for the interwebs!  It can be a little disorienting finding a place to park and finding the restaurant for the first time, but once you are past that, who cares?  The charm of the place is the courtyard-patio dinning experience with live music and lights strung everywhere.  Wonderful character that I don't see often in PHX.  I appreciated that the hostess asked if we wanted to be seated closer or further from the live music; she cared about our preferences for noise.  It does get a little noisy with the live music and that it is full of patrons, but nothing that bothered me.  I enjoyed the live music and it added to my experience; it wasn't too loud.  My meal was excellent and looked very colorful to the eye.  The chicken dish was extremely tasty, and so were the sides (salad and black beans).  I couldn't believe how the black beans tasted, I had never tasted anything like it.  The entree was fairly spicy, but not too spicy.  I really wish I had room for dessert, so next time I will definitely order appropriately.  My dinner date left a yelp review to get a discount on our meal and there was no trouble at all from the server.  Also, I must add, our food came so fast that we were shocked.",

If you simply can't choose for yourself on which meal to dine; their savory beef, flavorful chicken or succulent pork are sure to inspire. I experienced the \"Cola and Pineapple Soy Braised Angus Short Rib Roast\", \"Signature Pernil Asado\", and \"Pernil BBQ Quesadilla\"; all cooked to inspire moments of bliss.   The Short Rib Roast; my favorite of the three, leaves no room for disappointed, and that's a personal guarantee ;)  April and May are the perfect months to enjoy their outdoor patio, tucked inside the conspicuos hidden courtyard at the corner of 7th street and Palo Verde.   As usual with many establishments I visit, snag a great deal by picking up a $25 off 2 entree's certificate from restaurant - com. With certificate in hand, you could walk out the door for close to $30 including tax and tip. During the hours of 3-6 pm (Tuesday - Saturday), try appetizer portions of most popular dishes for $5 - $7 each.  Happy dining my friends!",

She used to take dance class in that building so we had all watched the restaurant evolve into the lively location it is now.  My husband made reservations for Valentine's Day as a surprise!  We got dressed up and went to the booming \"Crown Plaza\" area.  We selected a table indoors as it was 8 pm and getting cool.  We started with cocktails and I had the Ernest H. Mojito.  It was the closest to the cocktail described by Papa himself I have found!  I selected the pasta for an entree and the husband had the special paella.  We also got a side of the maple chili glazed carrots.  The food was delicious and the carrots are to DIE for.  Oh my...I could have just had the carrots and cocktail and been happy.  For dessert I sample the key lime pie and it was quite good.  The hubby had the Horchata bread pudding and it was huge!  It was a wonderful celebration!",

The pernil asado, glazed, carrots, and tomatillo/cotija/bacon chicken are our favorites; and don't even get me started on the horchata bread pudding!

The chicken chili relleno was good, not great.  Only major complaint was the nachos we not hot enough so much of cheese was not melted.  Guacamole was not a favorite of mine either.  Pleasant patio atmosphere, a little tight quarters but could be called \"cozy\".  We will certainly come back!!",

The chicken tasted fresh and the green tomatillo sauce, bacon, goat cheese, pico de gallo and tortilla strips complemented the chicken well. The tortilla chips were crispy and delicate, which I thoroughly enjoyed because they seemed homemade. For my first side, I had the cornbread, which was also moist and sweet. There were real corn kernels in the bread. My second side was the chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes. I thought this was also delicious and creamy. I would like to go to this restaurant again and perhaps try out their desserts.",

Low priced yes! However the small plates were absolutely delicious!!! Service was attentive and friendly. Relaxing atmosphere and the ambience was perfect. Such an unexpected yet great evening that we agreed to return for an actual dinner. Fast forward to tonight where we returned for dinner. Holy cow. Again, so pleasant from the moment we walked in. Hostess greeted us, asked if we wanted to sit inside or out. Now it was about 105 degrees at 7:15 however the misters, other folks sitting outside and the live music made us want to be out there too. Glad we did. Musicians took requests and were just awesome. However I'm a huge music fan so the fact that they were able to play George Benson and Al Jarreau did it for me. And live music on a Tuesday?? Score! Moving on to service. Excellent. I wish I remembered his name but our server was great in every way. Attentive and friendly. Was able to elaborate on dishes we had questions about. Entrees: my fiance had the tilapia with jalapeno creamed corn and chipotle mashed potatoes. Good lord!!!! That corn is probably one of the tastiest side dishes I've tried in a while, so flavorful! However I didn't detect any jalapeno or spice. Yet soooooo good and worth trying. I had the special of the night which was a chicken dish, the name evades me. Chicken stuffed with apricot and other delicious goodness. Paired with arroz and black beans. Oh my!!!! Such flawless flavor! I am not a fan of salt. I prefer flavor. Fuego comes through with the flavor, not the salt! Give this hidden gem a try. You'll be glad you did. Perfect for a romantic date night. It's such a casual place yet the food, staff/service, water fountains, umbrellas, misters and music turn it into a worth visiting! I'm an official fan and plan to return again and again",

I ordered the filet mignon (medium)  It was cooked to perfection the meat was so deliciously tender melted in my mouth.  As a side order I included the Jalapeno Corn Bread and the Mash Potatoes,  It was by all means a new edgy spin on comfort food.    Location is small and intimate, family owned, cute patio, perfect for a date or couple of friends.  The staff was great, greeted with a genuine smile.

Everything was fantastic and the service was impeccable. Everyone was nice and attentive, but that being said ,this has to rate as one of the BEST meals I have ever eaten. Its hard to find, but well worth trying. I eat out about 2-3 times a week and living in Chicago we are not hard pressed for a variety of places to eat, and I'm telling anyone that reads this, if your in the Phoenix area , you have to check this place out.",

The sides were actually better than the main dish which is where they fall from 4 stars, especially considering that entrees are $20-25 bucks.  I had a chicken breast that was panko breaded, smothered in tomatillo & cream sauce, topped with bacon, goat cheese, pico de gallo (fresh onion, tomato, cilantro, etc) and crispy tortilla strips.  Frankly I don't think I ever tasted the chicken.  Or the bacon.  Or the goat cheese.  Those are the things I was looking forward to.  That's what sold me on the dish.  But they were lost in the tomatillo, the cream, the salsa, the tortilla strips...this dish tried to do too much and suffered for it. This chicken was a jack-of-all-trades, master of none.  The sides-cornbread casserole and spicy mashed potatoes-were very good.  The bottom line?  Good but not great and if I'm paying $21 for a chicken breast I should be wowed.",

Chipotle mash was creamy and fluffy and not over powering on the chipotle. Cream corn was sweet and my fave of all was the corn bread casserole!!! Wow! You're not gonna find a better one anywhere!

    "text": "Fantastic food, but a little pricey.  I grew up in the neighborhood, but after all these years I FINALLY sat down to dine at this place.  My family took me here for my birthday.  Would've sat outside, but a monsoon rolled through so we settled for interior accommodations with a view of the bar.  Being a newbie, I pretty much stuck to anything on the menu that said \"signature\" on them.  So started with their \"signature\" empanadas.  Wow, were those awesome.  Almost look like a meat turnover, but packed with flavors across the board.  Also went with their \"signature\" pulled pork.  Grabbed their cheddar chipotle mashed potatoes and green beans too.  The pulled pork was tender as can be.  The orange sauce that came with it was sweet, but had an almost ferocious spiciness to it that caught me be surprise.  The mashed potatoes were excellent and I used those to absord the meat juices leftover.  The green beans were good, but nothing special.  Washed it all down with a red sangria.  As mentioned earlier, the prices were on the steep side.  The empanada appetizer was $10 and the pulled pork was $25.  Including sangria, tax, and tip, it was about $60 for my whole meal.  I definitely left full and the service we got was excellent, but still pricey.  I know for a fact they participate in Restaurant Week and usually charge about $30 for a three course menu (including drink), so if you're looking to save a few bucks and take this place for a test drive, that would be a good time to try.  If money isn't an issue, you can't go wrong with this place.  Great Latin American flavors abound and the sides and appetizers are great too.  I'll definitely be back at some point down the road.",

    "text": "We had a Groupon for this place that we just couldn't seem to get around to using. I suppose it was because the place was nearly an hour from our house. Anyway, I really wanted to love it. But here's what happened:  Things I loved: When we couldn't get a reservation the last week of the Groupon the owner offered to extend the date so we could use it; They have a GORGEOUS patio - with live music; service was very good; portions were generous: amazing mashed potatoes and cornbread casserole.  Things I didn't: The prices - they are steep; the complexity of the food. Now this last requires elaboration. I was reminded of a TV show (this actually sounds harsher than it is) that Gordon Ramsey does. In one episode a very nice French restaurant was having trouble and he explained to them that their dishes were too complex and it hurt the flavor. He suggested they simplify, which I believe they did, and to good result. This was my experience. The dishes I loved were simple and absolutely delicious.  But our entrees were not and they suffered for it. For example, my ribeye had cajun seasoning, then it had a roasted vegetable medly on top, then it had melted blue cheese over the seasoned meat and vegis. Too many flavors. And not one wowed because they all got lost in each other. Same with Jim W's chicken. It had panko breading and tomatillo cream sauce. But it also had goat cheese, crumbled bacon, pico de gallo and tortilla pieces. It sounds delicious but when I tried it the flavors were muddled and confused.    I hate to say it, but I would have been happier elsewhere. I'm going with 3.5 stars. I'm going to keep an eye on their menu. Maybe I'll give them another try.",

We arrived a couple of minutes early but we were seated right away and the owner Jeff came over and said he would be taking care of us personally. The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected. He asked if there was anything we were allergic to or didn't like, and then he just started bringing out food:  First dish - Veggie tostadas. Seemingly pretty basic but very flavorful Second dish - Beef empanadas. Delicious! Third dish - Jumbo prawns. Also very good, I liked the avocado sauce Fourth dish - Fuego pasta. Winner!! Super good and flavorful. Just had my leftovers for lunch and still held up.  Fifth dish - The \"finale\", cola and pineapple short ribs, ahi tuna, chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes, cornbread casserole, jalapeno creamed corn. I am not a huge seafood person, but the ahi tuna was really good, a great \"vehicle for flavor\" as my boyfriend said. Everything else on the plate was great. Unfortunately we were stuffed from everything so we were at odds with ourselves trying to finish what was left.   Just as we were remarking about how excellent everything was, Jeff brought out dessert! omg...  Sixth dish - Horchata bread pudding, key lime pie, chocolate malted ice cream, and ancho chile chocolate torte. My bf loved the chocolate torte and I could not have gotten enough of the bread pudding and chocolate ice cream.   To drink, I had the caribbean volcano and sangria mix. The sangria mix makes me never want to go back to just red or white sangrias.   The experience was great and Jeff and his staff were wonderful. We sat in the courtyard which was heated and had live music which was a nice touch. It was pretty busy the entire time we were there, and it looks like Jeff knows how to run a successful restaurant. We will definitely return.",

So yeah, Fuego has that going for them. They also have good service and a cute little patio. But this restaurant is in the weirdest location and I've never seen it busy. In fact, on all three of my visits, the place was practically empty. I also am not super interested in the majority of their menu options. They do have some tasty drinks, but their menu is lacking basic options for those of us that aren't quite up to par in the foodie world.   Anyway, if you're looking for something a little different with a delicious pork option, then this is your spot. Try a mojito and have some fun.",

The entree itself would have cost 30.00, so the restaurant week menu is a great deal.  We had the empanada for appetizers and they were very tasty. For an entree I had the Fuego pasta and my husband had the chili releno. We were both surprised at how large the portions were. 2 sides accompanied our meals and we both got the cornbread and I had mashed potatoes and he got the jalapeno corn.

    "text": "I'm embarrassed to say that I'd never heard of Fuego Bistro until last night. Now I'm a fan and I can't WAIT to dig into leftovers and go back again! The empanada app was delicious and a perfect portion. There was risotto special with seafood (that isn't always on the menu).... If this is a special when you're there, do yourself a favor and order it. Put the menu down, don't think about it again and order the risotto. Wow. Amazing. The Seafood Chile Relleno was equally delicious. Go on an empty stomach though - the dinner portions are HUGE!! But like I said earlier, I'm already excited for leftovers (I only finished about 1/3 of my dinner)!!   The staff was so nice and so much fun to be around. Our server was very attentive and super funny. The drink selection was quite unique with many drinks I've never even heard of and a pretty good wine list.   Like I said... GO ON AN EMPTY STOMACH! Portions are huge and so delicious it's difficult to stop eating even when you're full! :)",

    "text": "If I could give this place 50 stars, I would. My first visit I wanted something to go and ordered the Cubano sandwich. Now I lived in Tampa years ago so I know how a real Cuban sandwich should be. This was the absolute best one I have ever had. (My mouth is watering now). The rice and black beans that were with the sandwich.....well I almost didn't try them...how could beans and rice be anything but blah?   Well let me tell you, they were delicious and I ate them all.  Three weeks later I was back in the area again and I could hardly wait to get to Fuego Bistro. Ordered the empanadas and they were wonderful too. I mentioned to the server that next time I would try the pork because I love pork.  When I I started to leave she brought me a \"to go\" box. I had cleaned my plate so wasn't sure what it was. When I opened the box at home there was the most delicious pork I have ever had..I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!  I live in Scottsdale so I can't drop in every day BUT every three weeks I go to hair salon nearby. And I will always have lunch at Fuego. I'm going to work my way through menu. And one night soon I will be coming for dinner with hubby and friends.",

    "text": "BETWEEN FAIR AND GOOD.  We went here on a Friday night.  I had short ribs, which were a big pile off the bone and recommended by the server, huge portion, tasty, and in general pretty good (I shared with everone and they were a hit with young and old).    My wife had the tuna, which was at best average.  I'm terrible cooking fish, and I do better.  What shined were the side dishes.  I dislike cornbread normally, but the cornbread caserole was filling and outstanding.  The mashed potatoes with cheddar tasted several hours old, but still were good.  My wife tried the cornbread and like it, but also tried the carrots and said they were very, very plain and disappointing.  Children had standard fair chicken fingers and fries for $5.  Other option was buttered pasta.  Can't complain about the price, but it would be nice if they had something a little healthier or interesting for the kids, like a very small portion of the short-ribs, which my kids loved.   So here is the verdict... setting was pretty nice, especially in the enclosed patio, but food was just okay for an upscale restaurant, and in general overpriced.  For $20-30 entrees, I expect tastier better food.  However, quantities were nice.    Use your GPS, because it's easy to get lost finding this place.  Just when you are about to turn around because it's residential, look to your right and it's there.  Would I be back?  Perhaps.  I would like to try the happy hour (we just missed it) and try greater variety.  But I think there are definitely much better options in this price range in this portion of Phoenix (for example, Sierra Bonita Grill up the street comes to mind).",

Maybe it's all the new Fuegos they're opening up around town?  This also used to be my favorite place for mojitos, but no more. They've either changed their ingredients or the bartenders have forgotten their craft. It tastes even worse during happy hour.  Their food is still good, but its lost something recently. I wish I could describe the prior experience better, but its still a go-to place near the house. My main dish is always the short rib and I love their cornbread casserole and mashed potatoes. Happy hour is hit or miss at times on taste(both food and drinks). Service is always great and I've never had issues.",

    "text": "It took me a couple of u-turns to get to this place and I parked in the wrong parking lot, but I made it! It's definitely tucked away.   The patio is inviting; tables have umbrellas, lights are strung around the patio and could provide intimate dining ambiance in the evening.  I was here early 4:30ish for \"social hour\" and there was only one other patron. It appeared regulars and groups started to trickle in after 5:30.   They have a pretty good \"social hour\" menu that enables you to get a sampling of food. I shared the Peasant Paella that had shrimp, chicken, fish , chorizo with traditional saffron rice. The paella was filling and had a good amount of protein. It's only $11 on the HH menu and enough for two. We also shared the Pernil Tacos (shredded pork).  I would order both again, but the favorite was the Peasant Paella.    The drinks here could fair better. I ordered the Guava Mojito... But there was not one bit of guava to be savored. It was a refreshing drink, but not much alcohol in this $7 HH drink. My second drink was the Seasonal Sangria which was served with Apple sections and blackberries.  The dessert was rather large! It consisted of two robust squares of \"Horchata\" bread pudding scoops of Chocolate Malted Crunch ice cream and topped with whipped cream. I did not taste the Horchata, but It was good. Not phenomenal, but good.   The bathroom can use some MrClean and elbow grease.   On the menu it acknowledged the time that each of the employees have worked at Fuego. It's nice to know that employees have been with them for several years. They also advertise on the website that there is entertainment during social hour. While we were there (Friday 4:30-6pm) we simply enjoyed the swoosh of the leaves on the trees as the nice breeze pushed through them.  Overall, the food was good, the service was quick and the environment enabled the enjoyment of the food and company.   This would be a fun place to bring a large group.  our tab was just a tad over $55 : Mai Tai , Blue Hawaiian, Guava Mojito, Seasonal Sangria, Peasant Paella, Pernil Tacos, and Horchata Bread Pudding.  All items were off of the HH menu.  I would go back for dinner and I would bring a few friends.",

I'm not sure what Missy's position is at this establishment but she is the glue as we she that keeps it together!! With Missy we got hot fresh food, awesome cocktails & some great service!!

You have the option of sitting outside or inside. When we walked in I felt like I was in Ikea. lol. It looked like a home decked out in Ikea. Everything from the lamps to decoration to seating. haha  We ordered the Reposado margaritas since they were on happy hour. Hello Tequila! Oh my gosh, it was definitely worth the $5! The food was actually reallyyyy good. I ordered the Fuego Pasta which comes with a special creamy sauce, chicken, mushrooms, sausage and tortillas. I really liked the sauce. Some of the dishes comes with sides that you can choose from. My boyfriend got the creamed corn side and corn bread and they were both delicious! The creamed corn had a hint of jalapeno in it. There was a kick to it but it was amazing!   Each entree is a bit pricey.. we're talking about $20 a plate but I thought it was worth it because it was quite delicious. Other then their hidden location I loved their food. Plus I love me some Mexican/Latin food. =)",

    "text": "There is so much to love about Fuego Bistro.   One of them is the ambiance. This is the perfect place to take your date to. The setting isn't anything overly fancy and/or cheesy, but somehow they manage to make anyone feel romantic. We had dinner outside, at a time when the weather in Arizona is at its best and had a wonderful and picturesque dinner while being serenaded by talented musicians. I love this place because it doesn't try to be trendy or try too hard period.   The food of course is great. We started off with their signature empanadas, and it is definitely something I would recommend. The ground beef with the onions, cheese and barbecue sauce mixed together is spectacular. We also had the salmon croquettes and they were delicious. For my entree, I ordered the seafood kabobs with rice and the cornbread casserole. The seafood kabobs were just okay. I thought the kabobs lacked flavor. It was topped off with pineapple and papaya, which I've never really liked to begin with so maybe this entree just wasn't for me. The cornbread casserole however was AMAZING. It's probably one of the best things I've ever had. I would eat that cornbread every day if I could. My boyfriend had the seafood chili relleno and he is completely obsessed with it. It came with the jalapeno cream corn which was good but definitely not as great as the cornbread casserole. Our server said that we should try the chipotle mashed potatoes because it's supposed to be amazing. Speaking of our server, service was great. Everyone was helpful and ensured that we had a great time.   I'm planning on coming back soon to try their happy hour menu which consists of items that are not included in their dinner menu such as paella.   Writing this review makes my mouth water. I cannot wait to go back to Fuego Bistro!",

I've learned to stay away from their cocktails (weak and overly fruity sangrias and syrupy sweet mojitos) and just order wine or beer.  I always look for something new and exciting on the menu but it just doesn't happen. On this visit I had the usual short rib dish (that and both the pork dishes are the only stand-outs for me).  I've watched the prices rise and have not seen the menu options or the service keep up.  I realized on this visit that I only go here because I like to support an establish local business and the food is fairly consistent.  At this price point however, I'm looking for something a bit more.",

    "text": "This place is a hidden gem! It is in a building with a dance studio and art gallery. Parking lot is pretty small, so you will probably need to find street parking when it gets busy.   The restaurant itself is all outdoors. I loved the musician playing for us! He played great songs and had a great voice!   We had quite a large party, so our server suggested we start off with appetizers. The restaurant chooses 3 appetizers for our table to share for $7 a person. The prawns were served on a plate with different sauces, the empanadas were also very good, and the nachos were good to share.   Their drink menu is quite lengthy. I decided to try to the popular Moscow Mule. It came in the traditional copper mug and was so good. The people are me also enjoyed their beverages as well.   The entrees come with sides of your choice. I ordered the ahi entree with a side of jalepeno cream corn and green beans. The ahi was great- thick and tender! My favorite was the jalepeno cream corn. I like spicy food, so I enjoyed the nice kick to the dish. I tried another person's cornbread. The description is a bit misleading. The cornbread is described as a casserole, so I thought it would come out with sauce poured over the top. However, it was just a regular cornbread with some extra flavors in the bread. It was quite tasty. I also heard great things about the cheddar mashed potatoes as well.",

    "text": "I am insanely in love with this little gem of a restaurant. I, like many others, first went to Fuego Bistro after the happy hour Groupon was released awhile ago. After checking the restaurants website, I was intrigued enough to get a Groupon, but hardly prepared for what I got. So here's what I've had, in order of least fave to OMG-I-get-it-everytime: (Because I've only been during happy hour, none of this is the dinner menu stuff. So excited to order those in the future, though!) 1) chicken tacos- while probably better than most placeschicken tacos, this was sampled off someone elses plate after I had already had something better. So while good, not the best I've had here. 2) Horchata bread pudding- it almost pains me to put this so far down, but again, the other items were just that good. Presentation on this dessert is a ten. Size- wow big. I had to bring most of it home. Flavor was where it lost me a little. I'm big fan of horchata and was just expecting a stronger cinnamon flavor, not to mention I'm pretty sure there is no rice in this dessert.  The bread pudding was good, especially with the slightly melted chocolate chips and candied walnuts on top, but nothing resembling horchata. On a positive note, it was served with the most amazing cookies and cream ice cream I've ever tried. Id have been happier just getting a large scoop of that (next time!) 3) tilapia tacos- ahhh... spicy but tolerable, perfectly cooked, great blend of flavors. The fact that everytime I order these the tortilla falls apart and I end up eating it with a fork does nothing to dissway me from them. Terrific! 4) pernil quesadilla- and here is the reason I'm hooked. The most tender and flavorful pork inside a perfectly chewy/crispy tortilla, with gooey happiness inside. I'm in love. The last time I went, knowing how good these were, I ordered one to eat and one to go at the start of my meal. Try it. Love it. And then there's the place itself. Yeah, hard to find, but worth it. And have I mentioned that I live in Surprise? Completely worth the trip. Service is exceptional, ambiance is exactly what this place should be like. Can't wait to go on a weekend night for the live music. Def. my fave Phoenix restaurant!",

We got their early and were warmly greeted by whom I can only assume to be the owner himself as he was answering the phone. The tortilla soup was some of the best I have had in a long time and the entrees did not disappoint. I'm a sucker for goat cheese and my chicken was absolutely amazing! My husbands pork was very flavorful too (he was sweating that's how I know it was good). Our drinks were filled just at the right times and we left very satisfied customers.  I would love to come back again for happy hour if/when I'm on the east side again.",

    "text": "I would say Fuego Bistro's specialty is, well, everything.  Stand-up service, great lunch/happy hour selection and pricing, awesome patio setup, and some of the best Latin food I've eaten.  The waitstaff will definitely remember your name if you come back (and trust me, you will).  The mojitos are certainly delicious (blood orange for sure), but I would go for the sangria.  I like the red, but I hear the white is delicious as well, although a little sweet for me.  Pernil Asado is a sure pick, as is the dish with the mole should they put it on special again.  I'd eat and drink just about anything on the menu, and I'd be sure to leave full, drunk, and without a huge hold in my wallet!  Thanks, Fuego Bistro, I wish I found you sooner!  PS - they are on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a>, and they have a pretty lenient coupon-use policy if you're cheap like me.",

We ordered the HH pernil sliders for my daughter ($5) and it had pernil (marinated, slow-roasted pork), avocado, and a sweet slaw/cabbage on the buns. I snagged a few bites while my daughter ate. I was a little irked when I ordered the pernil (pronounced \"pear-kneel\" while rolling the \"r\") and the server responded, \"Oh, you mean the \"purr-nill\"?\" Note to owner, if you are going to have authentic dishes at your restaurant, please train your servers to pronounce your dishes correctly. Alright, rant aside, I had their red sangria (not that great), their first course grilled shrimp dish that had a really good avocado, guacatillo sauce. Yum. We also ordered the emapanadas. I liked them alot but my husband wasn't a fan. FB fills their empanadas with ground meat and my husband is used to my mom's stuffed with pernil. I thought they were good, though. Overall, I enjoyed my experience here. Their menu had a number of dishes I am interested in so I think I will come back again.",

It was kind of awkward because there's the main dining room and a separate red-headed step child dining room around the corner, not really attached at all to the main dining room and probably all the excitement. We got there right at the end of happy hour and wifey ordered a glass of Sangria, I had a glass of Tempranillo (that totally blew by the way).  I ended up ordering another glass of wine (don't remember the name) and it was pretty good. I got the cola and pineapple braised short ribs, jalapeno cream corn a chile corn casserole. The sides were good, although the corn casserole was a tad dry. The shorts ribs were great, they didn't have that cheap pot roast taste that some braised short ribs can have. The sauce was a bit thick for my taste, but not a huge deal. Wifey had the grilled shrimp appetizer with avocado and mango sauce appetizer and the empanadas. She loved her food. I wasn't a fan of the empanadas. but the shrimp were pretty good. Overall, I think it's a pretty good place and it's nice to have another option in the area. Would I choose to go back? no, probably not, but I know the wife will make me go back at some point.",

It's a small restaurant with a patio. We chose to eat on the patio, and it was very pleasant, plenty of umbrellas for shade and even though there is a busy street close by we could not hear the traffic. Now for the food, in a word: delicious! I had the chicken tostada with a chipolte cream sauce. It was actually 3 small ones piled high with tender well-seasoned chicken with the chipolte sauce, cabbage and guacamole.  There was also a side salad with it that had spicy glazed walnuts and seasoned tortilla strips, with a spicy dressing. The Fuego enchiladas were also very good, with sides of well-seasoned black beans and fluffy spanish rice. We did not have dessert but the offerings sounded wonderfully tasty, so next time we are up this way we will come extra hungry so that we have room! The place is a little hard to find but don't give up. It's in a courtyard surrounded by other businesses, there is a parking lot just past the building.",

I checked them out on Yelp and off we headed. The parking was a bit of a confusion. Do not park in Apollo's lot, but on the side street there are spaces near the entrance. The place was packed on a late Friday night. They close at 9 and we got there about 8:30. There was live music. Some better than others (open mic?), but entertaining all the same. The crowd was very mixed. Everything from Families with kids to Gay Couples and all in between.  We were not looking at spending a whole lot of time as it was close to closing. We skipped the starters (which turned out to be a good idea). We ordered a Natural Farm Chicken Breast and a Signature Pernil Asado. The Chicken was awesome. We would certainly order this again. The Pernil Asado was less than desirable. It came with two tortillas. The meat was plenty juicy, just not all that flavorful. The Chicken though was the bomb. For sides we got the Green Chili Cornbread Casserole (YUM), Maple Chili glazed Carrots (YUM) and the Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes (Good). Not the best waitress, but hey you can't have it all. The place was very relaxing and I loved the feel of it. I am sure I will be back. They have a great happy hour, though I do recommend going for a late dinner on the weekend. To bad they are not open an hour later, but the place is nice at night. I just want to try one of their famous Mojitos next time.",

Then you have to find the small sign as it is in a alcove of a small building.  We sat outside which was pleasant, if not a little cold.  The service was average, nothing special.  We did enjoy the food which was flavorful with good portions, if a little pricey.  The live music they had was enjoyable and nice addition to a nice evening there. The atmosphere is relaxed, yet efficient.",

    "text": "I have been to Fuego Bistro many times, all on Groupon deals.   This review was updated on 5/8/16.   I did not know this place existed until the Groupon, but the first time I went, I had a memorably negative experience with, I think, the owner.  He talked like he was the owner and he had \"owner profit concerns\" that an employee would not voice.  He was quite a heavy man about age 40, 5'10\", dishwater blond hair.    The Groupon required reservations, but when I called to make reservations and said I was coming at 5 pm that day, the waitress said I did not need reservations, just come on in.  I was dining alone.  When I walked in, the owner/manager did not believe me that someone on his staff would tell me I did not need reservations.  He told me nothing was available, but I saw only about 2 parties sitting on the patio, a few more inside.  I was upset that I was told I did not need reservations, and here he was turning me away.  Well, he said, that I could sit at the bar and eat my dinner,when I wanted to sit at the patio.  He also whined that he was not making any money on the Groupon.  I was not happy that he was denying me to eat there, when his staff told me I didn't need reservations.    I told him that I cannot be responsible for what his staff tells me, and if he was unhappy about losing money via Groupon, he should not have advertised his deal with them.  I think I sounded like I was going to give him a bad review, so after about 15 min of arguing, and not being seated anywhere, he told me that I could have a patio table.  After all we were arguing for 15 min and if the tables were all reserved, certainly no one showed up for their reservation at that time, and the patio was almost empty.  Since I was dining alone, I picked the most expensive item on the menu, which was the steak, to use my $30 Groupon myself.  This owner/manager became my waiter.  As I said, I think he thought I was going to give him a bad review as we had all this conflict as soon as I walked in.  I then realized that since I was dining alone, he did not want me to occupy a nice patio table for 4 on the patio, where he could make more money serving 4 people, so he wanted me to sit at the bar.  Even tho tables were not fully reserved, they had the POTENTIAL to be.  I was eating $30 worth of food and he was making only $5, which he even TOLD ME !  He made me feel like I was being punished for buying the Groupon !  Well he changed his attitude as my server, and became a very very gracious waiter.  The steak was PERFECTLY COOKED  (I ordered rare), and soooo pleasing and delicious!   The sides he recommended were terrific.  He seemed to make up for his rudeness as manager, when he became my server, tho his \"regrets as manager\" were unspoken.  The second time I went, was about a year later.  $30 Groupon required minimum party of 2, so I invited 2 friends.  This Groupon only said reservations \"recommended\", not required, and I did make reservations.    We ordered the Angus shortrib entree, the tilapia, and I had the seafood chilli relleno entree.  The sides were A+, and the serving size enormous.  I am a big eater.  The servings were so large that I recommend that people pay the $5 share cost, and share a dinner.  I made 3 meals out of what I was served.  The tilapia was bland to me, and I would have liked the Angus shortrib to have more sauce, but that is me.  My friends did not have my comments.  I am a picky eater.   The tortilla soup was not good enough to me, to order again.    We had two waiters, one said he did not know the menu because he had only worked there for one day, so he said to ask another waiter.   I always ask servers what are their regular customers' favorite dishes.  I have no complaints about our service, I would rate B+.    I would have given this place 5 stars if it were not for my bad experience with the owner the first time.    Our total bill was $69 before tax and tip and we got $30 off that.    I would come back here again without Groupon discount, which I cannot say for about 95% of the Groupon, Living Social, DealChicken, etc. deals.  It is a nice place to bring a visitor from out of town to sit on the patio, which is entirely shaded from 5:00 on.  They have misters in some areas.  This place is a good deal for the atmosphere on the patio and the generous servings of food that you could make several meals out of.   The happy hour food is really delicious, as well.",

I ordered the slow roasted pork with green chili cornbread and chipotle cheddar mash potatoes. Wife got the cola braised short ribs (huge portion) with cornbread and jalapeno creamed corn sides. Corn was a little spicy for her liking but I thought it was excellent. Would order her meal if we were to go back. Will keep an eye out for another Groupon.  I also have read past reviews about how this place is hard to find but we had no problem locating it.  Reason for the 4 star rating, and was close to giving it a 3 star, is because of the crying/whining kids in the dining room, maybe parents should take the kids outside when they start acting up or a staff member should ask them also. No one wants to hear crying & yelling while eating. Food saved it from the lower rating.",

    "text": "What a nice little \"gem\" ~ Fuego Bistro, to find that serves great food, has a nice ambiance and is conveniently located from just about anywhere (that is if you can find it : ^)   Our journey to Fuego's started by making a U turn in the middle of 7th because we missed Palo Verde Drive.  Some advise here ~ if you're not familiar with this area, using your iPhone or android map is a must! Although I must say, my co-pilot was using their android phone, that's why I had to make the U turn....  My iPhone would have done a better job in getting us there.    Back to our journey ~ we finally found Fuego Bistro, ugh...  or at least a sign that stated Fuego Bistro...  but the sign was in front of of hair salon and a dance studio.  Thankfully I read the Yelp reviews before going and knew this place was located somewhere behind these places.  Park the car, this is it!  After walking past stated businesses we found Fuego's Bistro! Tadda!  This is somewhat of an unpretentious restaurant with dinning both inside and on a patio.  We chose inside due to the weather.  It was not crowded so we were seated right away.  The service was very accommodating and pleasant.  We got our drinks right away and our apps were not far behind.  Drinks were very good and our empanada's as our apps were OK.  I would have preferred the salsa on the side so I could control how much to use.    We ordered the Fuego Enchiladas ~  chicken breast stuffed in flour tortillas, black beans, jack cheese, in there homemade red chili dijon cream sauce with a side of their black beans and rice.  It was very good, great temp with a nice balance of spice and seasonings.  The rice was the side \"super star\"!  I chose their House Speciality ~ Chili Relleno which was stuffed with chicken breast, black beans, jack cheese, cilantro, panko bread crumbs, covered with guajillo chile sauce and it was also served with black beans and rice.  The stuffing in my chili relleno was delish!  The breading on the out side was a bit too thick for me and tasted a little stale.  But the stuffing and rice were fantastic!    This is a great little \"gem\" of a restaurant and I am looking forward to going back to Fuego Bistro again very soon.   Next time I will most definitely use my iPhone map, I might make a hair appointment first, then eat at Fuego's and then book a dance class afterwards to burn off what I just ate : ^)",

It was a smaller portion, but the main entree portion was very generous, so I'm glad the appetizer was small.  The seafood relleno was filled with seafood and tasty sauce -- yum!  I also had the cornbread and the mashed potatoes.  Both were excellent.  I had to take half of my entree home because there was so much food!  The dessert was also good.  The banana burrito was just ok, but I had a bite of the bread pudding and that was amazing.  Definitely get the bread pudding as your dessert.  I also loved the blackberry sangria.  Just delicious.

I would have liked to try a dessert, but I was so stuffed. Also, our server reminded us that tip was included in our bill.

    "text": "I found the service here attentive and timely, but have to share some sentiments with other unimpressed Yelpers about the mediocrity of the dining experience. I was introduced to Fuego Bistro by my roommate who had purchased a Groupon without knowing anything about the restaurant.  It has a charming vibe, it's off the beaten path in a quirky courtyard bordered by a salon and dance studio. But the food was unremarkable... not by any means inedible, but rather forgettable. I felt the restaurant concept was a little confused given the choice of sides which don't necessarily pair well with every entree. I had the seared ahi tuna which was topped with a balsamic reduction and a mango/red pepper/avocado salsa. It was cooked properly but underseasoned except for the balsamic reduction which was nothing but sweet. Perhaps the blandness of this dish could be remedied with chili and lime and salt, but regardless, it did not deliver on taste. I chose to have the chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans as side dishes. The green beans were the best of the two, simple and tender, but the potatoes were lacking in flavor. Chipotle was only hinted at and the cheese was entirely understated. I know there has to be a way to elevate this food, but Fuego has fallen short.   My roommate was in agreement that the meal was not a hit. Even the Key Lime Pie for dessert did not make the grade. I see potential in this restaurant, since the staff is friendly and helpful. But ultimately, it's about the food and I can't recommend it. The only saving grace was that we did not pay full price.",

We were there for about 5 minutes before we even saw the employee. It isn't bad food, but for the price and from the reviews we were disappointed. I had the Enchiladas. they were cooked well, but the flavor was there. Bland. Not a good thing when the most flavorful thing on the plate is the rice. We won't be returning.",

We looked over the menu and were pleased with the choices.  Our appetizer choice were the empanadas which were quite flavorful.  I was crazy about the empanada dough they used, but it was passable.  The wonderful spiced empanada filling and crazy hot sauce fusion made up for the sub-par empanada dough.  We also had the chorizo and bean soup.  The blend of flavors in the soup was really fantastic.  We were both pleased with the soup.  It was also moderately priced at $3.00 per cup.   For entrees I had the Crusted Talapia.  It had a strange, yet flavorful sauce that it was served in.  For sides I had the arroz con gradules and the chipotle mashed potatoes.  Both my sides were great.    My partner had the Pork.  It was good, if a little fatty, but it had a wonderful marinated flavor to it.  For sides he also had the mashed potatoes (he raved about them too) and the jalapeno creamed corn.  The creamed corn was really good.    My entree was $19.  His entree was $18.  For dessert we had the banana burrito.  WOW!  This was so decadent, but we both ate it voraciously.    Drinks were good.  The martini my partner had was an interesting fusion of flavors.  I had their sangria which I found enjoyable enough, even if not on the fruity side.    All in all we would definitely go back to the Fuego Bistro.",

    "text": "Fuego is appropriately named, because this place is on fire. I'm not a big fan of Nuevo Latino places, because usually they underdeliver and end being more Mexican than Latin American.   The setting here couldn't be better.  Stop the presses.  Finally a restaurant.....not...in...a...strip....mall.  It feels like it's a neighborhood cafe you would find in New York or something. It's located on a side street off 7th St. and Bethany Home in a cozy courtyard building.  Kind of hidden. About 10 tables in the whole restaurant and a few patio tables.  The food here is outstanding.  For apps, we had empanadas and the coconut scrimps. It seriously had to be the best empanada I have ever had.  The pastry crust had just the right texture of flakes and bubbles.  It was filled with ground beef and herbs and topped with black beans, corn and pepper jack cheese.  Get the Pernil asado.  It's oddly reminscent of the cochinita pibil at Barrio, but better.  Drinks were pretty cheap ($5 Bacardi and coke), and the service was great.  The owner served us.  He was casual wearing a black hoodie, so it caught us off guard, but he was quick and attentive.  I really couldn't find anything wrong with the place, but don't feel it's entirely a 5 star place.  4.5 stars.",

If you don't mind the occasional table bump by patrons and staff alike, then your fine.        I had the Pernil Asado..Awesome!  Soft, flavorful and very well done.  The jalapeno creamed corn was good, but not spicy enough.  It is all about the mashed potato with cheddar!  My wife had the surf and turf and loved it...      It is out of the way and a bit hard to find, but totally worth the search.  Come hungry and leave happy!",

    "text": "Fuego Bistro is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix, if not my #1 favorite.  I was asked to attend a surprise anniversary dinner there a couple years ago, and since then I have returned many times for lunch and dinner.  Everyone has mentioned the food and how wonderful it is, and I am in complete agreement.  The Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes and Jalapeo Creamed Corn are amazing; I would go for those sides alone!  The appetizers are generous and the drinks are delicious.  Great all-around.  I will assume the generous portions have left the other reviewers too full to even consider ordering dessert; that's the only reason I can imagine not mentioning them here.  On my first visit, I ordered the Pastel de Tres Leches and fell in love.  The huge slice of cake wasn't your run-of-the mill Tres Leches.  It had an amazing mango or guava filling between each slice of cake and was pure heaven.  Also wonderful is the fried ice cream, banana empanada (I'm not certain that's what it's called), and the key lime pie.  So good!  My one and only complaint about this wonderful place is that they will not under any circumstances split the bill.  They will allow you to use multiple credit cards and cash, but you have to do the math on your own.  This is only tricky when you're with a large group, but even then, it's well worth it when you've enjoyed an amazing meal, tasty drinks, and were given top-notch, friendly service.",

The food is pretty killer too, I had empanandas with onion rings and I cleaned my plate-really good very, very slight greasy on the end of the empanada, but others would have crested much sooner.  Usually I get to sample other dishes but my companions were fully content keeping everything for themselves at this place, a testament to the quality of food being offered.

Really, this place is tucked away behind Apollo's on 7th Street, and I mean tucked away, in a small squarish strip center with a workout place and a psychic reading business. So, you can eat, workout and find out about your future love life all at one time.  The food here is wonderful with a strong Latin influence.  One of my favorite things on the menu is the creamed corn...holy crap...where do you see creamed corn on a restaurant menu these days outside of Mississippi. This creamed corn is absolutely devine and pairs well with many of the main dishes on the menu.  The shrimp is good, the latin style pork roast is my favorite, and the price is reasonable as long as you don't get carried away with the wine.....yeah...nothing seems to be reasonable for us.  The wine list is compact but very good.  The sangria is also very good, not Lola's Tapas good, but Ticoz good, which is pretty darn good.  A nice shot of brandy in the sangria can be a big help.  The patio is good when the weather is nice, and the interior is small, but charming.  You can often find the owner present and chit chatting with the patrons or eating dinner with his family.  All in all, great place to bring your wife....or your girlfriend (just kidding honey, this is our place...... I'll take my girlfriend to Durants.)  Waiting for the slap.",

Their soups are quite tasty and flavorful. The salad, I could've lived without. It was kind of wilty and blah. The empanadas are delicious, despite the cilantro. They have a hearty, starchy filling and a light pastry crust.   If they have the chile relleno special - get it! It's unlike any relleno you have ever had. Instead of being chocked full of cheese, it is filled with a melange of beans and other goodies.  The shrimp cocktail is a must-try too -- mostly for the salsa and avocados they are served on. The rest of it was kind of meh. We ended up scooping out the other bits and slathering it on the rest of our food.  Come early and come hungry!",

    "text": "This is the wedding of a smart owner and some great cooks in the kitchen.  First off, they have a small--probably 8 tables at most and that's counting several 2 person tiny tables--cafe offstreet in an alley.  We had a little problem finding it with the gps but we did.  He does have tons of parking, tho, across the street so that's no problem for those of you who worry. When we went last night in mid-January he had plenty of tables outside with many people sitting out there and even his hostess podium there, too.  Very smart move. Nobody seemed to mind it was winter and sitting outside, so I can only guess it was suitably warm out there.  We, however, were sat inside right next to the kitchen.  But, then again, if you are inside the cafe you will always be somewhat close to the kitchen. Now, the service:  Either this owner has told his servers to realllly take care of the patrons or we got the world's greatest server.  This gal (I'm guess 40's, long blonde hair) first gave us when we said we'd order sangria 2 tastes of both white and red for us to decide which one.  We went with the white that night.  It was good, but, having lived in Spain, it wasn't really authentic sangria.  Where was the fruit that always goes in sangria a la Spain?  Oh well...still good tasting. The lady server also gave us 2 free empanadas for me and my gal pal to taste.  OMG!  I have never ever liked empanadas because the crust is always crap and the filling is always dry or dull.  But these empanadas...like nothing I have ever tried before:  judgment is fantastically delicious! We both ordered the pork dinner which is pork shoulder (pulled pork to you) sans any sauce which comes on the side.  It's a whitish sauce--I think they called it mole or moro or something--that was light and delicious to me.  I poured it all over my huge portion of pork. I also ordered the special potatoes (wonderful!) and the creamed corn (a tad jalapeno hot for me but not bad at all).  My friend ordered the jalapeno bread, and I will get that next time as she gave me a taste....and, again, delicious. I consider myself somewhat of a foodie, and I say this place is soooo worth going to again and again.  Great food!  And even my gal pal who has some kind of intestinal bowel problem said she wanted to go back she loved it so much. This is my go-to place to eat in Phoenix now when I want some Spanish-style foods.  Fresh, delicious and you REALLY get taken care of here.  I love this place, and I can tell by this young owner's attitude that he really wants you to love his food and his service...and to enjoy yourself.  We did, we do and we will definitely be back here!!!! My prediction from the smart way the owner has set his place up that he will go very, very far in the restaurant business.  Clever set-up, great food, great service = a whopping success!!!!  (Oh, forgot:  The lady server--since we went between getting the short rib or the pork--also brought us a couple bites of the short rib to taste.  Is that fantastic service or what????)  UPDATE:  Been there a couple times now and ordered the same thing as before--only they didn't give up any free empanadas that night.  Dang...we were so stuffed anyway we could hardly get up from the table.  Food still delicious, tho! I love this restaurant, and plan to bring my ex-Chef son here to eat soon.",

I am living in the USA for the last 25 years, and I have being dreaming and missing the brasilian Empanadas all the time. Never, never at these 25 years found an Empanada good here in the USA like the brasilian Empanadas.....well untill this Memorial week end. I was in Phoenix and went to the FUGO BISTRO and told myself..\".well try again order the Empanadas, what do I have to loose?\" Woooowww......what was my surprise, the Fuego Bistro Empanadas were better than many brasilian empanadas. I went to heaven and had a orgasm enjoying the delicious FUEGO BRISTRO EMPANADAS. Let me tell you, their Empanadas are crispy, fresh, not....no not oily or fat with lots of delicious feeling of meat and black beans....just like the ones they offer in a wonderfoul bar in \"SANTA TERESA NEIBORHOOD\" IN  Rio de Janeiro. Sweet bayby Jesus, now each time I will be in Phoenix I will go to Fuego Bristro for the  Empanadas, and don't worry there is plenty of good very good food for all the Americans that don't care about Empanadas. My american husband and  my american friends ordered other things and loved it. The \"Chile relleno\" was a sucess. So...do not expect a fancy place, Fuego is a very simple location on 7th street a little hard to find but is worth. Don't judge for the first impression of the place when you get there, wait until you taste the food and you will agree with me it is food they will  have in HEAVEN if we get to HEAVEN. So, please go and try the EMPANADAS, specially if you a dreaming and craven for good Empanada like me for so many years.; Thanks Fuego crew you guys are fantastic and I WILL BE BACK. Beto the empanada's lover.",

    "text": "My husband and I always pick local restaurants and have eaten at many across town. First, let me start with the positive. The staff was very friendly, and the sweet story about the place on the back of the menu is a nice personal touch. I also liked the introduction of the staff on the menu; a nice way to personalize the people and place. So far so good. The only thing that was a little \"off\" was the jazz music playing inside. My husband and I looked at each other and shrugged. It definitely didn't fit with the cobalt blue tiles of the bar and the rustic look to the tables.  So the story about the place was sweet, atmosphere was conflicted, but after reading reviews, we very much wanted to like the food. We didn't. I ordered that paella and my husband went with chicken tacos; both on the \"small plates\" menu. On a positive, neither plate was \"small.\" However, the paella came out so hot that it was inedible and burned my mouth. I had to stir and stir it to just be able to eat it. When I finally got down to eating it, I noticed that it lacked any flavor and spices. Perhaps I just hadn't tried the meat? I took a bite of the white fish and it tasted horrible! It had no seasoning and it tasted \"fishy.\" Not a good sign. I tried a shrimp and then a piece of chicken, and then finally the sausage. The only thing I can say is that is was totally underwhelming. I have had many a paella, and this was frankly flavorless. I wanted to make a remark to see how my husband was faring, but the restaurant was so small that I was worried we might be overheard. I noticed from his body language that he wasn't too thrilled, so dinner was spent in uncomfortable silence. We payed $50 including tip and walked out.   My husband asked me what I thought and I shared my statement above. When I asked him, he said. \"I thought that it had flavors, but it just wasn't done correctly. A piece of chicken fell out of my taco and so I ate it separately from my taco. There was no seasoning. It was like they pulled a slice of chicken out of a package, threw a mayonnaise sauce and and some pickled cabbage on a tortilla and called it good.\"   We were both disappointed and sad to see a local place serving such mediocre food. We aren't critics, but we were truly disappointed in our meals.   Two stars simply because the staff was kind. Would not recommend.",

    "text": "We were in the area on a Wednesday evening for an event and left hungry so decided to pop in for a little date night food & cocktails thanks to their fab Yelp reviews. It was a gorgeous evening and to our surprise, they had LIVE music!! That is so hard to find these days, especially on a Wednesday. We even had plans to hop on over to The Womack for a cocktail after dinner but stayed because we enjoyed the music so much!   I ordered a delicious cocktail that had gin, lemonade, grapefruit bitters, and other goodies. It was served in a martini glass with a sugar rim! SUPER tasty - yes, I had 2! My husband had their margarita and also enjoyed it.   For dinner, we split their Paella and the Fuego Sampler that had a great variety of items. These two dishes were the PERFECT amount of food for us since we had already eaten a few things at the event. The sampler is LARGE!   All in all, we had a great experience with friendly service, yummy cocktails, tasty food, and live music under the stars on their romantic patio. My only complaint is that it is pretty pricey! However, portion sizes are large, so that is a plus. For small plates, you can expect $12-$17 and for entrees $25+. Cocktails were around $10-$12. They DO have a Yelp deal so you better believe that we purchased that to get $10 off of our meal! :)",

I'd never had empanadas before; that being said, these were sweeter than I expected.  But they were still good.    The nachos hit the spot!  We sat outside and listened to live music and, with the misters going above our heads and lights on outside, it was quite comfortable and a fun atmosphere.     The service was a bit slow at points, but all the servers were friendly.  I would recommend this place!",

    "text": "I went to this place for the first time on June 30th around 8 pm. My friend and I took a seat on the patio. We were given a menu. Five minutes later we received water. We spent several minutes looking at the menu and waited for a waitress. Several minutes had passed. I hear the waitress sayin good night to the table behind us. I think to myself, okay here comes the waitress making her rounds. Nope! No waitress comes to our table. My friend and I continue talking. I check my phone. 15 minutes have passed. Several tables on the patio empty out while we wait.  I tell my friend, I don't think you'll be getting that drink I promised you. Her response, I think maybe not. We finally decide to leave about 25 minutes after arriving. As we walk out, I hear a woman (staff I assume) saying good night.   It's unfortunate. The patio and atmosphere was nice and the food smelled good but I'll never know because I have no plan to ever return. No restaurant that knows anything about customer service should leave customers waiting that long to order. Damn shame that Denny's has better service than this place.  Let me add, I wish I read the reviews prior to going here. I tend to read the worst reviews first to see if there's a pattern and there seems to be one. I also would've thought twice about going after seeing how the owner likes to rip into his reviewers. That's most definitely not cool or professional.",

Then there's the food...  We shared a few appetizers for the table and they were all incredible.

I'll be mad at myself tomorrow for not saving some for leftovers. I tried everyone else's food, too, and there wasn't a single sub-par meal.  Dessert was next level. Get the banana burrito.",

    "text": "I had a massive internal debate on how to rate Fuego.     As much as I don't want to admit it, I had a 6 year old <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> gift certificate (purchased in 2011, no joke), and they actually accepted it no questions asked.   That's a plus.    The courtyard patio with ample heaters and live music was a great scene.   Another plus.    My food was incredible.  Both apps brought to our table (the prawns and the empanadas) were massive portions and delicious.   My entree of short rib enchiladas with mashed potatoes and cornbread was...well there's no other way to describe it besides fantastic.   Incredible meal, all around.  I loved the food and based on this place's ratings, just about everyone else does too.  But none of it was hot when it reached our table, and therein lies the problem.  Service.  So before I pick the service apart, I want to say that the food really is top notch and therefore why I debated so heavily on whether to give Fuego 3 stars or 4.    If the service was as good as the food, this would have unquestionably been a 5 star review.     Service was quite literally terrible:    1) It took almost 15 minutes to get service once we had been sat.    2) The full menu suggests that there's a separate wine list available upon request. We were, however, denied when we requested this from our server.     3) The kitchen was clearly working much more quickly than the wait staff, as our apps and entrees had cooled significantly before being delivered to our table with the sole exception (inexplicably) being my wife's side of piping hot beans.     4) I can't tell you how many times both my water and Negra Modelo and my wife's sangria sat empty to the point it got uncomfortable.  Actually, I can tell you on the alcohol.  We went for 10-15 minutes after the first round went dry before being offered a 2nd round, and were never offered a 3rd round.  Getting water refills and drinks brought from the bar was incredibly difficult.       5) When we ordered dessert, we asked for the nuts to be put on the side as my wife is allergic to them.   It turns out the nuts were tossed in the spice mix that gave the dessert it's \"Ancho Chile\" designation.  There was otherwise no \"Ancho Chile\" in the desert.  It was therefore just  an ordinary dessert and if our server had advised us that the nuts carried the dish's spice, we would have ordered something else.    6) I watched the hostess loiter around and do mostly nothing, at times wandering completely off the restaurant property while messing around with her smart phone.  IMHO she could have been helping the rest of the wait staff.    7) The obvious signs of shutting the restaurant down began around 8:45 (they stop serving at  9pm).  While they didn't kick us out, the anticipation of going home was obvious from the staff even though there were a lot of people still there.  I have a problem with the \"I can't wait to leave this place and I don't care if people notice\" appearance.    Our server was friendly and polite, he (and the rest of the staff) just weren't nearly attentive enough.",

The food is way too expensive for no reason. I can think of at least 5 higher class restaurants with better food quality, better service, less expensive. I don't think I would ever come back.  This is post your comment, Jeff.   - 1. I never argued with anyone regarding pricing, I just showed you that the Yelp menu differed from yours. As a matter of fact, I didn't even tell her the pricing was different, I just showed it personally to you. Nor did I mention in my review that you made the mistake of showing the public two different menu prices.    2. It's never professional to use vulgar language in a review, this reveals immaturity and inability to receive constructive criticism - the first thing you mentioned to me was tell you how I felt.   3. Your wife's service was not bad, I never said her service was bad, just not attentive like I mentioned above. I've had much less experienced waiters/waitresses that provided me with better service.   4. It's nothing to take personal, it's something to learn and improve from.  5. If leaving an honest review of something that didn't meet my expectations defines that I'm a bad human being, I think you need to reconsider what the definition of being a good/bad human being is.  6. Are customers not entitled to order what they want? There is a reason why we didn't finish the food that we didn't box and also a reason why that tip was left. Also, if you look at other reviews that were not to your liking, you will notice there is a consistency with what I reviewed as well.   7. 5 restaurants that are less expensive and better. Also, their ambiance is much more elegant except Greek life. One thing you did great on is the way your restaurant was set up outside.  Maggiano Persian room Postino Switch Opa Greek Life",

    "text": "Another Restaurant Week find! They had a preset-meal  for $33 that had numerous choices. I went with the cornbread appetizer, a 3 pork sampling, maple glazed carrots, chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes, and the red sangria. The downsides: white sangria tasted relatively watered down and the bread pudding = yack! Literally, one of the worst things I've had in the last several months--dry and tasted burnt. Came back a second time for HH--we tried the pernil nachos (greasy) but tasty, the empanadas, chicken tacos (stuffed full), and a blue Hawaiian to drink. Even with just the appetizers, we were full! Portions on the first meal experience were also generous.  The entertainment on the patio was really fun! A woman with red hair singing and playing the washboard, there were some spoons, and a guy on the guitar. They were great!  The set-up is very unassuming but cute, with tables outside on the patio and a small inside space. If it weren't a million degrees for 5 months here, I'd choose the patio every time.  Service has been good and all staff members have been very nice.",

It is awkward to invite out of town business people to eat here and have  them see plates with chips and cracks on the edge.  This is not a run down Denneys guys!  Plates cost money, but losing customers will as well.  Toss these old plates out--please!  This is supposed to be UPSCALE....good lord could you imagine having cracked plates in Scottsdale?   YIPE! B.  All bars have containers with fruit (limes, oranges, lemon slices) to put in drinks.  It is a RULE to have a lid to cover on  this when not taking items out.  This not only helps keep items fresh by keeping out air,  but keeps flies off.  But  here at the bar in plain sight-- all the fruit slices are in open containers..bad bad..dries out the fruit an attracts bugs and worse customers see this!  NO NO. That is why every time I get a drink I have a piece of fruit  that looks DOA! C.  other than that I have no gripes..love the staff and food--well it would be nice if you had an email...but don't worry I will still be eating here..but until you fix these two complaints I will NOT be bringing my business   people here..Sorry.  They do not understand.. looking forward to your response.....",

    "text": "Ambience, great music, great wait staff - this one will rank very high in my list of places to go when in Phoenix.  We did not have much trouble finding this place, though it is not that obvious from the street. There is a ballet school at the front so once you find that, you are there. You can walk to the back of the small parking lot or just past the entrance of the ballet school to enter the courtyard where the restaurant is. We were seated in a side room where they have live music. We were eating early so we missed the piano player.  Both of us had the blueberry sangria which was the special of the day. Since we were there during happy hour, we were able to order from that menu. I had the house salad and the peasant paella (which is only offered during happy hour or until gone). The house salad was large with fresh avocado, lovely variety of fresh young greens and slices of tasty tomato. That was so filling I had trouble getting through the paella which was one of the best I have ever had. It had chicken, tilapia, shrimp and chorizo with Spanish rice. I think if the salad had been smaller I could have managed both. I had to eat the entire salad, it was SO good!  Hubby chose the empanadas appetizer from the happy hour menu and it looked to be a meal sized portion to me. Two could have definitely shared that. Hubby also had the seafood stuffed chili relleno which he declared exquisite. For desert we shared the kahlua creme brulee - I only had a bite or two because I was so stuffed but it was an incredible dessert.  We are planning on returning to this place because of the ambience and the fantastic food. I envy the folk in the residential neighborhood for their luck in having such a place within walking distance.",

The atmosphere is amazing - the outdoor patio is pretty and romantic. I was thankful to be seated inside though - it's still a bit hot outside for dining alfresco! The inside is quaint and cute and cozy.   Service was excellent - everyone was friendly and helpful   And then the food...my lord....the food! Started with the empanada appetizer - so delicious. The sauce was sweet and it went perfectly with the pastry and the hearty filling. I had the Panko crusted chicken breast and it was really good - but the sides....that's the thing to go for...the cornbread pudding business is to die for - sweet, savory, creamy, crumbly - insane!!! The cheddar mashed potatoes were pretty amazing as well.   This little bistro is worth your time and your money - I plan on becoming a regular.",

The inside dining is very limited, but the place you want is on the patio, anyway.  We went for Happy Hour, which is a smashing deal.  The mojitos are truly wonderful.  We tried the Classic, Dragonberry, Blood Orange, and Coconut.  All fantastic.  For eats, we had the empanadas, (beefy, beany and oh so yummy), pork quesadillas, and Ahi tuna sliders.  All winners.  But the desserts, DANG!!!  We had the chocolate torte and the Key Lime Pie.  Now, it's really hard to get good Key Lime pie, but theirs is homemade and fantastic!    Service was wonderful, prompt and friendly. We can't wait to go back and try the full dinners.",

We went with a large group the first time and they were great about us having 7, including two smaller children.  Last night my wife and I went back for a date night and had the most wonderful time!  Jeff, the owner, is fantastic and always wants to make sure you have a great time.  The sommelier was also great.  He talked to us about the wine, gave us some tips for pairings, and even had us take a sip of wine while chewing our food.  It totally changed the character of both the wine and food.  Speaking of the food, the short ribs are amazing!  The best sides we've had are the creamed corn and the chipotle mashed potatoes, but the maple chili carrots and the cornbread green chili casserole are also very good!  The cocktails are great and the happy hour menu is pretty reasonable.  We will definitely be going to Fuego on a regular basis!!",

I've been to all the Fuego Restaurants (Cantina, Bistro, Cityscape, Tacos). They all cater to a bit different crown and have a different vibe and, aside from a few staples, different menus. This one, Fuego Bistro, is by far my favorite.  I love this restaurant. I'm not a foodie, not a snob, don't give half a crap about the historic atmosphere and unique setting or vibe. In fact, I don't even eat there (I almost always get it to go). BUT MY GOD THE FOOD IS SO DAMN DELICIOUS.  I've tried a number of their dishes. I'm not a fan of spicy (very finicky stomach)... I never cease to be impressed with this place. The food definitely has a unique zing to it, very flavorful, but still somehow doesn't kill my tummy. It's not overpowering, but unique. The flavors and textures really work well, too (and I'm not one to normally give a hoot about things like \"textures\"). Even I know that it's VERY well made, well-thought-out food.  Kinda small menu, but everything is so good. I prefer the dinner menu - it is quite different from the lunch menu. Not cheap, not expensive, very generous portions. Well worth it. It really is fusion, like none other I've ever tasted - I can't describe it using anything other than \"INCREDIBLE\"!  Some of my favorites:  - Empanadas (wow)  - Dinner Menu Chili Relleno (oh my god - it has mahi mahi, mini scallops, shrimp, and other deliciousness). Definitely get the jalapeno creamed corn as one of your sides, they are perfect together.  - Steak (get the mashed potatoes as one of your sides)  - Prawns (amazing)  To the people that said their shrimp was probably from Trader Joe's, their food was bland, the service was bad, or the experience was \"just MEH\" you must be THOSE people, the ones who always have to bitch about something. I've been here at least ten times now, and I've never gotten anything but perfection. It may not look like the Ritz, but you definitely won't be disappointed.  Very personable, nice staff, good and quick service the one time I ate in, lightning fast service when I do take out... even when they are packed. What I love - even when I go in there with a LivingSocial voucher, they treat me well. EVERY single time, whether it's dine-in or to-go. Usually when you use a voucher and order to-go, the hostess's face reads 'I'm not getting a tip' and you get service to match. Not here! Truly impressed. Also, I've noticed elsewhere that to-go portions get stingy compared to if you dined in. Also not here - the to-go portions are still huge!!!  They get busy on weekend evenings (especially during fall/winter - patio season), so make reservations.  My SINGLE gripe: They have limited seating, and most of it is patio (very little inside seating, small place). I'm not a people-person, I like my privacy and personal space... I like to tuck away in a corner. This is impossible inside (it's a not-very-large rectangle, there just isn't an out-of-the-way table)... it's kinda possible with some of the courtyard patio seating, but I don't really like to eat outside. This is why I get to-go. Oh, yeah, parking does get a bit skimpy when they get busy... I've so far always been lucky and gotten a close spot, but I can see how some people might complain about it.",

    "text": "Despite the awkward location, the food was really good!  As part of restaurant week we came here for the tasting menu.  Our reservations were for later that evening and we got in maybe 30 min early.  There were several tables available, but the manager or whatever he was...made us wait on this awkward bench next to people who were eating.  It was really uncomfortable....and I was getting annoyed.  Later he realized that since there were a handful of tables open...and instead of torturing us he would finally seat us (the entire time we were looking on yelp for the nearest restaurant as we were starving and tired).  He made some off handed comment about money being wasted since we were sitting there...and then made another weird comment about my birth year when he carded me?!?  Anyway, we ordered off the tasting menu and had the nachos and empanada- AMAZING.  must try.  For dinner my date got the Asada and I went with the pasta- both came with two sides.  I just have to say the mashed potatoes are amazing and you must get them.  My mouth was at a happy on fire state of and couldn't be happier.    I will have to say that the service is just ok.  It seemed like this may have been the first time these people were servers and were a bit shy.  Even when we were awkwardly sitting there two ladies we were sitting next to were complaining it was slow.  Besides that, the food was really good and so was my watermelon mojito.    I also really liked the atmosphere- sitting outside and having a nice quiet dinner.  perfect.",

    "text": "Fuego Bistro is one of my new favorites! A couple people have recommended it to me, so my boyfriend and I decided to try it for restaurant week.   We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation to have a drink on the patio. The staff was super welcoming and friendly. Matt enjoyed a mai tai and I had a red sangria - both very refreshing. Our table was ready right on time and we had an awesome waitress who gave great suggestions on ordering... there were so many good looking options on their restaurant week menu. We're sharers, so we ordered with that in mind.   Drinks:  We got the pomegranate mojito (very refreshing) and a peach-blood orange mojito (sweet, but very good)  Starters:  Signature empanadas: Tasty. The focus was the meat, I would have preferred more vegetables inside. Sauteed prawns: The star here were the sauces - delicious!  Entrees:  Cola Braised Short Ribs: AMAZING! Some of the best we've ever had. The short ribs were very tender and not fatty at all. The flavor was so good! Pernil Asado (shredded pork): So delicious!! I made little tacos with their fresh corn tortillas.   Sides:  Green chili cornbread casserole: A little drier than I had imagined, but great flavor.  Maple chiliglazed carrots: The glaze didn't really stand out to me, but good as far as baby carrots go. Jalapeno creamed corn: I was pleasantly surprised - really enjoyed this one!  Chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes: A great side with the short rib.   Dessert: (By this point, we knew we'd need to be rolled out of the restaurant, but we HAD to have dessert since it was part of restaurant week).  Chocolate chip bread pudding: Really good chocolate chip bread with scoops of malted chocolate crisp ice cream. This was a lot of food after that meal, but I savored the bites I had. The ice cream was excellent! Banana burrito: exactly what you'd picture with scoops of the same icecream - delicious!   I can't wait to go back to Fuego and tell my friends about it. Great service, charming atmosphere, and excellent dishes.... Fuego is a winner!",

The house red wine was great, beer was cold. We enjoyed our entrees, chili relleno and short ribs. I took half of mine home so I could eat dessert. I had the chocolate chile torte. The dark chocolate torte was excellent, not much chile but that was okay. Husband had the key lime and loved the tartness.  Nice evening!!",

I started with the November Rain cocktail which was strong in a good way and very tasty (well strong for me, maybe I am a lightweight). For dinner I had the Pork Medallions with green chili cornbread and tortilla soup as my two side dishes. While the pork was delish, I felt the chorizo was a bit understated. The flavor of the soup was divine and the cornbread was a fun compliment to the meal. Oh and hooray for local music!!  The meal was excellent and the Groupon made it that much better, without it I think the food is a tad overpriced.",

There aren't too may Latin American places that I've found in AZ.  So I was excited to try it.  We got there about 5:15pm.  When looking at the menu noticed that we got there right before happy hour ended.  We ordered the empanadas, cubano sliders, salmon croquette and a salad.  Plus a glass of sangria.  When the food arrived it looked so good!  Wow the flavor was amazing!   Our server was very attentive as well as the wait staff.  Our drinks we're never empty.  The ambiance was very relaxing.  Music playing but not so loud that you cant hear each other.  I think the only negative was that they didnt have coffee.  According to our server they usually dont make coffee during the summer time since it is so hot.  When I have dessert at a restaurant I like a coffee.  I think coffee should always be available.  Maybe even make it to order.  I'd give this place 4.5 stars if I could.  I'll definitely be coming back next time I'm in town.",

When calling for a reservation ask to dine on the patio or in the room with the bar, the \"other\" room isn't as lively.   Beware the food portions are huge....save room for the deserts as they are simply devine & made in house.  The new times have given the restaurant kudos for their mojiotos & i have to agree with the new times staff, they are good  i like the regular ones the flavored ones are also good, just not my favorite. It is a small operation, the kitchen is effecient & depending on the day you could wait for service & food.  It is well worth the wait.  Bring a companion that you actually enjoy their company, or sit at the bar & be a companion of the restaurant.",

My wife had given me explicit instructions... \"good food tonight\", and from the reviews, Fuego Bistro seemed interesting.  We're in from SF, and don't know the area at all.  First, we were struck by the pleasant ambiance, with a fountain in the courtyard and a jazz trio playing - quite a juxtaposition from the parking lot and surrounding block when you arrive.  The owner, Jeff, greeted us and even though we didn't have a reservation (on a Friday night) was really pleasant and found a place for us - especially important because we had our little one in tow and he was getting hungry.  Jeff helped us with the wine list and pointed us at a great \"off-menu\" bottle at a very reasonable price - a great way to start a meal.  But it was the food that really impressed.  We tried the empenadas, the pork, the salmon croquettes, the tortilla soup and the prawns.  Everything was outstanding.  I have to say though, strangely the real standout for me was the jalapeno creamed corn - and I'm not usually a creamed corn fan.    The deserts were also great - we split a chocolate torte and some ice cream for the little one.  The torte was rich but yet light.  All I can say is to try this place.  It seems like the folks working there have a real pride in what they do and it shows.",

Our server was friendly but inexperienced (which honestly would have been fine if all the other things were good).  The food was mediocre at best and the atmosphere was pretty depressing.  When I asked the hostess (who was refilling our waters) if she would mind getting me a straw she said she would try and then never came back.  The guac tasted like the prepackaged guac from Trader Joes, the Ahi was tough, bland and mushy all at once, and the corn reminded me of canned creamed corn that I ate when I was little. There was great music outside but it was too hot to be out there was no music inside. The staff seemed miserable and bitter.  I'm so sad that this place with such a cool inspiration was such a disappointment.",

    "text": "My man took me to Fuego for a pre-birthday meal on a Wednesday night. I was surprised to see how many diners were there a. Because it's a Wednesday and b. Because it's in such an odd spot!! Once you get past the randomness of it's location, you will see how quaint and homey feeling it is. The two servers working the front of the house were friendly multi-taskers who welcomed, advised and fetched drinks while we decided on, then waited for our meal. We started with the scallop app and agreed that it was great, although small (3 scallops/$13). How bout one more tasty morsel? Apparently, it was small to save room for the hulking entrees we graciously received next! Wow! I had the seared ahi-a huge portion of it spicily seasoned, lightly seared, and great tasting! The man had the stuffed chicken breast, and inhaled it. It looked great as well. Also in the \"great\" category were the side dishes! Omg, the cheddar massed potatoes were so freaking scrumptious I could die! I also had the jalapeno creamed corn, that I mixed with the potatoes to make a combo from heaven! Man got the green chile cornbread casserole, which sounded meh, but tasted incredible! Such a fantastic meal! Stuffed with amazing food, and pampered by attentive servers, I was disappointed that I couldn't give Fuego 5 stars. But it wouldn't be prudent.  Why, you ask?  Because the sangria sucked. I had both the white, that tasted like watered down kool-aid, and the red, that tasted like old, cheap red wine mixed with coke a cola. They both sucked. Not good. Hopefully it was an off night, beverage-wise and I just happened to be there for it. Everything else was spot-on!",

    "text": "Maybe my expectations were too high...but I was underwhelmed by my experience here. Nothing I tried was bad, but the flavors were fairly bland. The best dish, IMO, was the empanada appetizer. The bbq sauce was great and did not take over the flavor of the filling. We ordered the pernil asado and chicken breast for entrees with sides of jalapeno creamed corn, green chile cornbread, chipotle mashed potatoes, and green beans. I barely tasted the jalapeno, green chile, or chipotle. The mashed potatoes had a kick of heat, but not of flavor. The chicken was moist but nothing spectacular. The one thing I would go back for is the pernil asado. It was moist, tender, and the orange habanero sauce was not too sweet. I really wanted to like this place but it just didn't work for me. Although the portions are big, at this price, there are many other restaurants in the area I would choose for dinner.",

    "text": "My first visit was intended to be a weekend afternoon of appetizer's and cocktails. After reviewing the selections on the happy hour menu, it was easy to see that choosing \"one\" option was not going to be easy. We started with the wild salmon croquettes with a lemon caper beurre blanc sauce and the vegetarian tostadas and at the suggestion of our server the white and red wine sangrias. While a favorite here is difficult to choose, I would have to say the croquettes are at the top of my list. The tostadas are made of small fried tortillas with a guacamole spread was served with veggies and cheese, and topped with a chipotle aioli. By the time all was said and done, we had spent a greater part of the afternoon sampling the happy hour menu and ending it with the chocolate ancho chile torte, one of my favorite desserts of all time. For dinner, if you enjoy a spicier dish, you might try the green chile corn bread casserole. It is a great balance of sweet and spicy that I can't resist!   The atmosphere and staff are both welcoming making this one of my favorite downtown local spots.",

I mean, I dream about it sometimes lol. I love stopping by for lunch when the weather is perfect, like it was today (it reminded me of being back in Orange County) and eating out on the patio. Oh, and the corn bread...oh my goodness, the corn bread. That has to be the best side dish you can get this side of the Milky Way. I've gone through about half of their menu and I'm telling you that there is no way you can go wrong with anything there. Their cocktails are really good too, and I love the names they give them. Had the \"Boss' Wife\" today and it was very tasty. This is one of those places one should absolutely check out. If you're a local, there is no reason not to come here often, and if you're in town for a day or so and want to go back home bragging about the best food you ever had, this is the place to come. Regardless what you order, I absolutely, without a doubt, recommend that you order the cornbread side with your meal.",

    "text": "My bf and I went to Fuego Bistro last night and we were so impressed! Usually food at that price point can be pretentious and bland but our meal was amazing. We started with the empanadas which were to die for. (highly recommended) My bf got the Fuego Pasta which was impressive looking to say the least. While you don't get any sides with that entree, the portion size is huge! But be careful, this dish is SPICY. I ordered the beef short ribs and let me tell you, they changed my life. The meat was sweet and tender and the pineapple-cola glaze was incredible. Since I got two sides I ordered the cornbread casserole and the chili-glazed carrots. They were both delicious (the cornbread was my favorite) but the carrots were a little too spicy for me.   We each ordered a mojito with our meal. My bf ordered the traditional and I got the grapefruit-pomegranate. That is EXACTLY how a mojito should taste. The mint wasn't overpowering and while those babies were strong, it didn't taste like I was sipping on mint-flavored nyquil.   For dessert we ordered the horchata bread pudding. This was the only part of our meal that was a bit of a disappointment. We couldn't taste any horchata and the bread pudding itself had without a doubt been microwaved as it had a rubbery consistency.   The staff is very attentive. Our glasses were never empty and we didn't have to wait long for our food.   All in all we were very pleased with our meal and will be for sure returning in the near future!   P.s. Make sure you order a mojito. It's easy to see why they've won awards!",

It was delicious and was bursting with heat. It came to the table hot off the stove and the flavors were spicy in a good way. We would order it again. For desert we had the grilled banana with the whip cream/coconut/walnuts/chocolate&carmel&strawberry sauce with ice cream ($8)...ya it hit the spot perfect. Delicious!  Only downside is the prices are on the high side; but if you have the dollars to spend the food tastes great. Even the water was good...cause it was filtered, which was a nice change from other restaurants that serve Arizona's awful tap-water.   Thumbs up! Service was good too. Ate by candle light.",

It is hard to find the first time, but once you do you will go back again; Did I mention the Sangria? red is my choice, but he also has white; and just about any drink you can think of; the Happy Hour is great with terrific items and low prices. When we go early we get some Tapa's and then dinner after, and always wind up carrying a box home for the next day; and the leftovers are just as good.  You cant go wrong with any of the entrees, although, i have a hard time deciding between the Short Rib and the Pernil Pork. My hubby loves the seafood, but the Chef always has a special of the day, that is to die for. l personally love the Chile Cornbread Casserole, and the Creamed Jalapena corn,, but all the sides are good; and, if you are in the mood for sweets,, their desserts are unbelievable . Spring and winter you can eat outside, and some nights they have music. The Staff are great, and we go again and again.",

All of the tables were taken when we showed up for dinner, so we ate at the bar which was actually our preference.  Steve the bartender served us - nice guy, knowledgeable and passionate about the food there.  We split the special that night, which was a stuffed pork tenderloin - absolutely delicious.  Also split the scallop appetizer - also delicious.  Great (red) sangria also.  All in all a really good find and we'll be back to try a couple of other items highly recommended on the menu.  Steve mentioned they have a jazz group outside on Fridays which sounds like fun.  Definitely recommend.",

Everything I have ever had at this place is phenomenal. They flavor their food in unique ways I would never even think of and it turns out great.  The sides are delicious too (example: try the Green Chili Cornbread Casserole and Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potato). I typically do not enjoy desserts, but they have a Chocolate Torte with ice cream that melts in your mouth (yes, that means you should get it!). I very rarely write reviews, but this place is totally worth it! The staff is very pleasant and you can usually catch the owner, Jeff, sauntering around. Every person I have introduced to this restaurant is blown away. One tip: The food does take a little longer to prepare than Jack in the Box, so allow a lunch break longer than 30 minutes to allow time to order, receive and enjoy your food. Also, if you are planning on going on a busy night like Friday or Saturday, I would suggest you call ahead to ensure a reservation since it is a smaller restaurant. I first found out about this restaurant a few months ago through a promotion and once you try it, you'll be hooked too.  They also participated in Restaurant Week in 2010 and I hope they do it again in 2011!",

Typically go for lunch and happy hour which are divine, but very impressed with dinner selections as well. Enjoyed the once a year  prix fixe featured during restaurant week (RW) with a 4 course offering of several options to choose from. The empanadas were very good, chile rellano comes with seafood but asked for chicken and they obliged, the cornbread casserole has bacon in it which should be listed on menu and I do not believe was. I do not eat pork  and since my son is a vegetarian when I shared a taste with him the waiter informed him it had bacon in it. No worries they replaced my side with the cheddar mash potatoes (scrumptious).  The only complaint is the feeling of being completely stuffed upon our departure. :-). Will continue to revisit all the Fuego locations to enjoy their Latin cuisine. However my favorite meals are the happy hour or lunch menu over dinner. The lunch menu is truly representative if Latin cuisine and the dinner more southwest style. Either way good eating.",

We did have a reservation for 7:00, but since it was a Thursday night, there would probably have been no problem just walking in at that time.  We ate inside (loved the decor!), but would have been equally comfortable (temperature-wise) eating outside as it was a temperate evening and they did have heaters if it got cold.  The restaurant is a little hard to find, but they do a good job with sandwich boards on the sidewalk pointing you to the restaurant, and it's totally worth the search.  If you have a GPS, that'll help, otherwise look for the signs and park in the lot to the left of the restaurant and the little cluster of businesses it's in.  I had the Tilapia Incrustado with sides of the cheddar mashed potatoes and jalapeno creamed corn, and he had the Ropa Vieja with sides of Arroz con Gandule and black beans.  Both were very well done with good flavors in all items.  He really liked the sangria, and had a basic mojito with 10K added during dessert.  The Banana Buritto for dessert was delicious.  We were happily full from the meal.  Yum!  Service was a tick slow, but there were only the two guys working the tables.  They never forgot anything we asked for, tho', even if they had multiple tables' of things to remember.  Entree prices are moderate, altho' adding drinks and desserts puts it in the \"spendy\" category.  We were extremely pleased to get the Yelp 20% discount ($14.95 for us) just by asking for it.   We're not local to Phoenix, but would definitely come back on future visits to the city.",

His beef was just a big ol' portion of the same thing that comes in taco form over at Fuego Tacos. So, I think fuego tacos is a better value overall. But it was a big portion and he had plenty for leftovers.",

Fine drinks, very friendly staff, and I find the restaurant's setting and location to lend itself well to the slightly rustic (and slightly dirty) overall feel of the Bistro.  But, whatever Fuego may be missing in terms of polish, it more than makes up for it with a menu of very tasty and moderately creative offerings.  I would order meats with confidence here, especially their pork, as they seem to really know what they are doing with their slow cooking.",

    "text": "Went here with a Groupon and had heard great things about this place so were looking forward to it.  Had to make a reservation according to the Groupon, which is not what  I like to do, but went along with \"the instructions\" .  Got a nice table on the patio and order the made from scratch sangria and looked over the menu which seemed great.  The sangria just didn't do it for me - it tasted a little off, if that is possible with sangria.  I noticed that no-one else had ordered it around us, so I am guessing that was not the right thing to order.    I ordered the chicken and my partner the pork.  We had the same sides of green beans and cornbread.  The cornbread was good - we have both moved here from the south, so it was as good as what we were used too.  The green beans were a little bland for me - I felt they were just like I cook them at home (i.e. nothing special !).  The chicken itself was fine, just not a wow - I just can't tell you exactly why.  I think there may have been too much going on with it, I am not sure, I just wasn't like  \"OMG I must have some more of this\".  The pork, to me, just tasted like shredded pork, again nothing special, but my partner really liked it.  Overall i was disappointed after hearing such great things about this place and have had better Latin American cuisine elsewhere at better prices as well  - sorry Fuego Bistro.",

    "text": "I went here tonight with the BF. We thought it was really meh, capital MEH. We had a reservation, but for some reason got sat inside. There were virtually no people eating inside and outside was lively and had a band playing... we couldn't even hear it inside... it was like silent. I would think they would at least open the doors, but nope. So that was a bad start. It took our waitress a long time to even come to our table, and when she came she asked if we wanted drinks and apps (which we didn't given the portion size) and we ordered dinner. The waitress seemed kind of short with us, and it may have been that she was busy or that she was mad we didn't order more items. Anyway, so I ordered the chicken and the bf ordered the pulled pork. Both were pretty lack luster. First off, the food came out really fast... like it was all premade fast... and it wasn't really hot, just kind of warm. Like other people have said, the chicken sounds really good but actually comes out kind of bland. The menu says the chicken is pounded but my chicken was like 2 inches thick, so that was weird. The breading wasn't really crispy and the whole thing just wasn't that good. The bf's pork was also kind of bland, even with the dipping sauce that came with it. The sides were alright (mashed potatoes, corn bread, carrots-these didn't have a ton of flavor). Despite the food being underwhelming, we did decide to order dessert. This is why I gave this restaurant 2 stars. The banana burrito was delicious! I wish I had just eaten this for dinner.  So we get our check and I have a 30$ groupon. The bill comes back and only 20$ was taken off. We waited for about 6 minutes for the waitress to come back and she was good about it, she fixed it. It just seemed like a weird mistake. Anyway, for the two of us to get mains and split a dessert (no apps and no drinks) cost me a total of 45$ (would have been 60). This was way too much for what we got. I felt kind of ripped off. Maybe it was just my experience, but it was overall underwhelming.",

The food wasn't bad, although they drench everything in sauce, covering up the flavor of anything the meat/fish could taste like (maybe on purpose). Not to mention their food is overpriced for the quality & venue ambiance. Our waiter was one of the worst I've encountered. He should probable change occupations soon. he was lacking customer service & a personality. Autozone may be a better fit. My girlfriend asked our choices of sides and his response was \"they're listed on the menu\". Wow. He also treated us like criminals because we had a groupon. He didn't want to let me see my bill and once I seen it I noticed he charged me full price for my drink purchased during happy hour and said it was bc I used a groupon.... Although my entree alone covered the $30 groupon...?? Felt like punishment. Lol. They also don't serve tacos after 6pm, weird! Oh, & the restroom Is disgusting, felt like I was at an auto repair shop.  I would NEVER return here or suggest this place. Stick to Fuego tacos & Fuego city scape!",

If you know how picky I am about quality., preparation, flavor and that I pretty much tolerate today's restaurants, you know how picky I am. They have really wonderful flavor combinations. It has all the flavors Arizonans love, chili's and spice, vibrant notes of sweet and salty, depth of flavors. We had the steak special, you could almost cut it with a fork, it was tender with an amazing port reduction glaze topped with a sprinkling of blue cheese, we also had the seafood chili relleno. The seafood was fresh and lovely, the relleno was made correctly (which is saying a lot, sadly) and the cornbread casserole is worthy of bringing home an extra piece. We had the kahlua creme brulee, it made me smile. It reminded me of an updated tiramisu; a perfect cap to an amazing meal. Fuego is a great place for a nice evening for two or for an adult gathering. Did I mention there's four pages of drinks on the menu? A great place to start an night of fun. Make a reservation because this place can get really busy.",

The layout is odd (we were in some sort of disconnected annex that was loud enough with three couples sitting in it...can't imagine what it's like when full), and it's pricey.  The mojitos are amazing, but the Yelp special is really misleading. It says:  \"Mention YELP and receive one free mojito with each entree purchased at the Bistro, CANNOT be combined with any offer.. Who wants mint?\"  Except apparently you have to eat there three times to activate the whole free mojito thing. That doesn't sound right, does it?  Also, we had a great server, but there was another lady there that was EXTREMELY boisterous. Like, slightly obnoxiously so. I'd rather have her than a bad server any time, but she'd be a bit much after a while.",

Friday and Saturday nights you'll definitely want to make reservations ahead of time but the live music while enjoying your meal is ambiance icing on an already delicious meal.  I had the Pernil Asado plate which even without the sides was amazing.  The most succulent pork tacos on corn tortillas you'll ever taste makes you not want to put one down until finished, that is until you try the side choices.  I ordered the cornbread cassarole and the chipotle mashed potatoes, both are very generous portions and my brain couldn't make it's mind as to what my next bit was going to be because everything tasted so good.  I decided on a round-robin approach to get the most out of it all since my taste buds then couldn't become immune to one flavor.  The cornbread cassarole was a slightly bit spicy due to the chiles used but the sweet cornbread tamed it to a very light and slow burn.  Chipotle mashed potatoes, the name itself is pretty descriptive and if both of those things call to you, you will never be disappointed.  With the meal was also ordered a dragonberry Mojito which was probably the best Mojito I've had in a long time, it went really well with the entire meal...especially the sweet sugared rim as a contrast to the spicy/hearty flavors of the meal.  Excellent place, excellent food.  Only issue I could comment on is the lack of parking.  Don't park in the empty lot of Apollo's, they get real angry.  If you're not lucky enough to get a spot in the complex's small lot, you'll end up parking on the local side street, which does give the opportunity for a little post-dinner walk to help digest.",

    "text": "If you are picking up Spanish and you want to learn one word, you might consider that word to be 'fuego'. Just don't scream it in a movie theater or any other densely populated place where people are looking for excuses to get their trample on.  You see, Fuego, which means 'fire' in Spanish, also happens to be the name of another kick ass, hidden Phoenix restaurant. (Although with 136 reviews and counting I'm not sure if 'hidden' is appropriate any more.)  Understand this... I am not one to use 'lingo', but I found myself describing the pernil asado plate with the side of green chile cornbread casserole and chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes as 'the bomb'.   Yeah. I know.   I even said it out loud. Defcon one faux pas. Get out the dead culture carbon-dating machine.  Now here is where it gets worse. Not only did I use this expression once, but I used it again and within a span of minutes of the first offense.  Yep. The horror and the humanity.  So, if we define a 'bomb' as something that, when detonated, levels everything inside the immediate area, and by 'everything' we define that as most of the metro Phoenix restaurants alive - then yes, Fuego is 'the bomb'. Usually my wife would be blushing and apologizing to restaurant patrons for being within earshot of such verbal offenses but she was right there with me, elbows to the sky, eyes ablaze, emitting barely articulate grunts and enhanced hand gestures in what we now lovingly refer to as 'the Devouring'.   Even though they have expanded, the restaurant is a small place so making reservations is recommended. We arrived a few minutes before 6pm on a weeknight and the restaurant could have easily charged us full price for the appetizers we ordered but they honored the happy hour price. (And we did not even ask for it!) Sweet!   For appetizers I had the signature empanadas and my wife had the ancho dusted wild salmon croquette. Both were amazing and only tantalized us for the main dish. The main plates are large portioned and we even took some home. We then finished the evening with their homemade key lime pie and coffee. Service was quick and efficient and food was delivered at perfect temperature. The prices have increased a bit since a year ago, but it's worth it because when you dine at Fuego you get to partake in a restaurant that respects the art of the food. I hope this restaurant stays around a long time.   We were there for a birthday so we went with appetizers, drinks, main dishes and dessert, but you can easily come away in the 2 dollar sign ($11-$30 per person). Do the happy hour thing and you'll even save more.  So, be like a caveperson and go discover Fuego. If you are reduced to slack-jawed grunting and lame superlative lingo, don't say I didn't warn you.",

I said she was rude to us and slammed the bowl of guacamole on the table and he interrupted me several times and w/out coming out and saying it directly, he was insinuating that I was lying.

So, we went yesterday for a pre-birthday lunch for me and my sister. I started with the spinach salad with citrus vinegarette dressing, BACON, goat cheese and candied walnuts. It's an entree side so I split it with my man. My main course was the stuffed empanadas. It came with a large portion of beans & rice. Um, um, good!! At most restaurants it seems like the beans & rice are an afterthought, but not here. Everything was perfectly seasoned.   Surprisingly, I managed to save room for dessert. Key lime pie with topped with toasted coconut. I'm a key lime pie connoisseur and this is as good as it gets.

    "text": "Alas...I've given up the idea of writing a review for a place if it isn't at least 4 stars. Sue me; I'm in the industry.   Fuego Bistro is by far one of the best places I've been to recently. I was introduced to it this last weekend on a date. Ironically, it's super close to my house yet I've never heard of it. When we were arriving, I was a little curious to see where the hell he was taking me since there aren't any signs really and it's pretty hidden. Once we were inside, though, it was like finding a little treasure.  The patio is welcoming & even though we didn't have a reservation (aka we couldn't sit outside) we snagged a table close enough to enjoy the beautiful weather.   We started off with a round of mojitos and even though it's been a few years since they've won best mojito...I can say the Prickly Pear was the best I've had in a while. The Ahi Tostadas followed & they were awesome...the sauce added a kick to it & it was a perfect start to the meal.  After, we shared the Fuego Pasta with chorizo, chicken, mushrooms, peppers, & a chipotle cream sauce...huge! What I did eat of it was delicious. My favorite (and my date's I'm fairly certain) was the special...an herb crusted Mahi Mahi with a pineapple sauce, home-made cornbread, & chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes. Amazing. Even though the Mahi Mahi might be hard to come by if you visit, the two sides aren't & are so good, I'm droolin' just thinking about it. :)  Dessert? Try the banana burrito. Heaven on the tongue!  Kevin was an excellent server which just highlights the night. It's hard to have a great meal without great service but he provided just that.  If you're in the area...check it out. If you aren't...check it out. I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed.",

It was so rich with flavors, packed with corn with a healthy distribution of jalapeno and bacon.  Fell in love with the cubano sandwich. The pernil was smoky, juicy, and was just all around delicious. Hands down, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  Also had the pernil nachos. I was initially concerned that we'd have too much pernil on our table, but this was not the case. The house salsas and sauces were so good as well. I couldn't get enough of the green sauce and kept wondering what the heck was in it. I considered getting a spoon to straight up slurp it, and in hindsight, maybe I should have.  Had the margarita and mojito. Solid drinks.  For desert, we had the ancho chile chocolate torte. Though I was so full from the cornbread and pernil dishes, I needed to order desert to complete the food experience. The flavors were really good. The torte was rich but not too sweet, which made the desert enjoyable.  I rarely go for take out boxes, but I couldn't leave the unfinished cornbread (I needed room for the pernil dishes!) and torte hanging. I further enjoyed these later on.  I couldn't deny the 5-star rating as we had an all around stellar experience surrounding the food, ambiance, and service. I cannot wait to drop by again. I'm the type of person who likes to order new things from the menu, but best believe that I'll have that cubano sandwich again.  Thank you, Fuego Bistro.",

She did very well in the beginning, checking on us, willing to answer any questions. Once our entrees came, she was no where in sight. She would spend 10 min gossiping with other customers making her rounds. We never saw her. A few times we watched as she almost dropped dishes carrying them out to other customers, she did it twice. Although there was a tall white guy, kind of nerdy. He was the buser/host. He was amazing!! Always filled our drinks, took our empty dishes and glasses. He made up for our horrible waitress. He deserved our waitress's tip and then some. Other than that, I have no complaints.",

    "text": "If the review was based on how hard it was to find this place they would be In trouble....haha....but luckily it Is based off the food, drinks and service (which were all surprisingly good). First I must say that this is a great patio restaurant and we went on a night with live music which was a bonus!  The inside space is super limited so if you are going in the summer definitely make a reservation.    We started with the empanadas which had great flavor.  Highly recommended!  For dinner I went for the pernil asado, it was super tender and had a lot of flavor.  We also ordered the seafood skewers which had plenty of meat and were cooked very nice.  They were not my favorite (I would rather have my tuna rare/seared not fully cooked) but they were still good.  I ordered my son the nachos off the kids menu.  The nachos were $9 which I thought initially was a bit ridiculous for a kids plate but when they arrived I was pleasantly surprised. They were bigger than most regular nachos you would get at any restaurant and had a ton of the pulled pork Which my son gobbled right up (I had a few too).     I had the seasonal sangria (6/10) and a blood orange margarita (9/10).  The drink selection was really good and I'm looking forward to going back and trying more of them.  If you're not in the mood to spend a little coin I wouldn't recommend this place.  The appetizers are between 10-15, most dinners 25-28, and the drinks 7-10.  If money is no object then this place is a must visit.  Also it seems like they run a groupon quite often where you spend $10 and get a $30 credit towards dinner.",

We unfortunately had to sit inside because we didn't have a reservation but either way it was great.  We started with a order of the empanadas and they were awesome!  My wife ordered a mojito and it was poured very strong and very good.  We then ordered something that was not on their menu but we saw pictures of it on Yelp so our excellent server Pashley helped us get it.  We got the braised beef and it was to die for.  The meet was so tender and moist.  We got the potatoes as one side and the jalapeno cream corn.  Was one of my favorite dishes and places that I've been to in a long time.  We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Little disclaimer: we came on restaurant week so they likely had all hands on deck, but based on our first visit we will definitely be back  We had the appetizer sampler and while all of it was worth eating again. Perfect little Cuban slider and the empanada was different and flavorful.   My wife had the relleno, carrots, and mashed potatoes. I had the asada, corn bread and creamed corn. We both really enjoyed our food but I wouldn't order the creamed corn again. It was much better than canned but not enough to order in a restaurant. I'd definitely get the potatoes next time.   For dessert we had the banana burrito and chocolate torte. Both came with chocolate ice cream. Both were good but I had to ask for a knife to cut the fried banana. It was a bit tough to eat with a spoon.   Service was great, everything arrived right on time and the food was very good. We sat on the patio and the atmosphere was really nice. They had a talented combo start playing just before we left and they weren't too loud for the environment and sounded very good.    The restaurant is definitely eclectic and you do have to walk through the tables to check in, but that is because of the building and size of their patio. Don't let it throw you off. If you like your food the temperature of the sun then this is not the place for you. We found the temperature of the food to be fine although not piping hot as some seem to expect.",

The waiter was sort of a doofus, stumbled thru the specials and was not very engaging.  4. The drinks, while crafted beautifully, were $$, not really worth it in my opinion.  5. The food is generous, cooked perfect, tasted good, but not worth the $$.  6. The dessert was beautiful and $$ and not worth it.  7. The LIVING SOCIAL saved me $20 bucks (free drink and dessert) 8. The band was awesome 9. The space was perfect for an April evening, forget about July.  10. I would go back, with a LIVING SOCIAL type deal, order and split one meal, skip the drink and the dessert. I would be in and out of there full, happy and for about $30 buts before tip.   I had the Strip steak, mashed taters and casserole. The flavors are great.  Wife had the pasta with chicken and sausage. (EVEN BETTER LEFT OVER) Drink was some foofoo tasting drink, good but small Dessert was a malted sundae, I liked the candied pecans.

All that having been said, it could be like many other restaurants, but then comes the food. The menu is unique in its own right, featuring a variety of meals. The quality, portions and taste of the food are, in this reviewers mind, the best we have ever experienced.

    "text": "Would definitely come here again - 5/5 for food, and 4/5 for service, but the food was good enough to bump it up to a 5 overall.   FOOD: Amazing. We got the Lunch Feast, which was reasonably priced for all the food you get. We were absolutely stuffed, and had leftovers to bring home. For anyone who's curious, here's what it included... Our appetizer platter had empanadas, spicy veggie tostadas, Fuego salad, and Cubano sliders. Everything on this platter was mind-blowingly good except for the salad, which was good, but nothing special. The meat in the empanadas were my husband's favorite - tender and flavorful, with a delicious sauce, and I loved the way everything went together in the Cubano sliders. The tangy pickled slaw on the veggie tostadas made them a highlight, as well.  The entree platter came with Pernil Asado, Fuego pasta, tortilla-crusted tilapia, beans & rice. The Pernil was excellent, the same as the meat on the Cubanos. It was juicy, and came with pico de gallo, tortillas, and more pickled slaw for topping. I think this is one of their signature menu items, and for good reason. We loved it! The pasta was really good with the other menu items, but my husband and I agreed that we probably wouldn't get it by itself, just because there are so many better options here. At a different restaurant, I would definitely get it. It was cheesy, with lots of different vegetables and a unique sauce. The tilapia was probably the worst part of the whole meal - I usually love seafood, but there just wasn't anything special about this menu item. The fish itself was well-cooked, but the sauce was bland. The beans and rice on the side were delicious, and some of the best I've ever had. They didn't taste like an afterthought, as they are at so many other restaurants.  The Feast also came with two desserts - the bread pudding, which was pretty good, and the flourless chocolate cake, which was to die for. I still crave it. Their homemade ice cream was unique and delicious! I probably would have been able to appreciate it more if I weren't so stuffed at this point in the meal.  SERVICE: We came on a weekend for lunch, and it wasn't too crowded, but there was only one server taking care of everyone. That was our only complaint - the service was slightly slow, but it wasn't the server's fault. She mentioned that there was an unusually large crowd for a weekend lunch, so this probably isn't a thing all the time. Bussers and others seemed to do what they could to help the server out, which was nice to see.",

We got veggie burritos, hold the cheese and sour cream.. they were filled with lots of yummy veggies including lots of green beans.  The sauce was good.  My side of roasted carrots was good - crispy.  GREAT service - it was a rainy night and we sat inside next to the piano, which we thought might be a problem for conversation, but it wasn't.. because the music was only a couple of songs and then it was over.    I dropped a star for 2 reasons - it was expensive IMO for veggies, and there really was a very limited selection.  TIME to do better - Phoenix has LOTS of vegans, Fuego Bistro!!

I had ordered the seafood chili relleno which wasn't great but wasn't bad .. the sides of the cornbread(great), mashed potatoes (alright)... the bummer was being in the back room our waiter totally forgot about us ... we saw him when he took our order . Some one else delivered the meal , we had to ask another person for a refill on drinks , and a fourth person gave us the check . That really was a bummer !  The live music was alright , wish they hadn't put speakers on as well !  Overall quite a few things could have been improved .",

    "text": "I came here with my wife during restaurant week and I had the special they were running for the week. I had the empanada, slider and tostada appetizer which was excellent! The empanada was the star of that fish and the pico de Gallo was fantastic. Then I had the Fuego house salad which was ok but would not be worth the ten bucks it would cost on the regular menu. My main meal was the peasant paella which had tilapia, shrimp, sausage and chicken. This was excellent with the caveat that there was too much tilapia compared to the other ingredients. My sides were the jalapeno corn bread and the cheddar jalapeno mashed potatoes both of which were excellent! The dessert was the chocolate torte which by the time we got around to that we were almost too full to eat it! My wife had the beef main dish that was special and that was excellent as well!",

    "text": "Can't say enough good things about Fuego. This is been a place I've been coming to for several years, and I always like the fact that the owner is active in the business. Either working the front desk or checking on gas, he seems to take a passionate interest in what happens at his restaurant. From the food to the drinks to the desert all our top shelf. There's often a special or some kind of limited offer on the menu which is always a win. I've probably been here for happy hour over a dozen times, for lunch half a dozen times and for dinner a few times other than that. You can't go wrong with Fuego, I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a unique concept.",

    "text": "A hidden gem near downtown Phoenix. Latin inspired food and drink in a funky back of parking lot location   Cocktails and sangria are interesting, intricate and made with love.   The food in complex and deep in flavor. Example --the cornbread is fresh made with whole corn and baked to a crunchy crust.  The empanada appetizer is nothing like the street food you may have experienced in the past and is made with a light crust and filled with a ton of meat, spices and a few veggies for accent.   4 people in our party and our dishes ranged from steak to seafood and everyone raves about the food.   They have inside and outside seating in a cute out of the way location.   Owners and staff have been together for many years and you can tell everyone has worked together for a long time and still enjoy working together.   Funky not fancy. It's awesome.   Go now.",

    "text": "My wife and I joined a foodie meetup here for our first visit. Before anything else, be sure to bring your appetite! The portions are very generous, from the tapas, to the entrees, and even the desserts.   I had the pernil asado with sides of maple chile glazed carrots and the green chile cornbread. The pork is very flavorful and juicy. The orange habanero mojo sauce adds tang and zip. There is enough pork for at least two dinners! The carrots are tender and tangy, with just a little heat and a little sweet. The cornbread is both crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, with loads of corn kernels, slices of chiles, and smokey bacon bits. Heavenly!  My wife had the vegetarian pasta. After eating her fill, there was enough for two more meals. It was filled with green beans, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, and a chipotle cream sauce to add some heat and zing. She loved it.   We shared the ancho chile chocolate tort for dessert. The tort is a dense lode of chocolate goodness with just a touch of the ancho chile's heat and flavor. This is joined by a huge scoop of chocolate ice cream, crunchy malty bits, whipped cream, and a drizzle of chocolate sauce. As good as it is, we were not able to finish it, as it is as generous in size as the entrees.   This is a place we will keep on our list of favorite restaurants!",

    "text": "2018 YELP CHALLENGE: 68/100  3.5  More like PRICEY Mexican-inspired Latin fusion! Incredibly festive yet relaxing atmosphere. We luckily got a reservation on Mother's Day/Graduation weekend Saturday night (which is kind of odd). Again, expensive, but the portions are good and it was such a relaxing experience.  Quick Tips: -GROUPON. -Mostly OUTDOOR patio, but they do have a private dining room (great for groups, family outings, and date night!) -Bad cell reception.. but who's on their phone at dinner? ;) -Live music 7pm-9pm that changes nightly! A Mariachi band proceeded the Live Music (wish we came later!). Check their website for a Live Music schedule. -They share a tight parking lot with the Ballet Boutique, but there's street parking and another restaurant's lot next door.. -Only ONE bathroom for each gender. It's a wait on a busy night. -Skip the cornbread.   Taste  Tour of Fuego ($16.25) 3.5/5 A crispy empanada (4/5) with ground beef (supposed to be pernil?), a salmon croquette (4/5), a spicy veggie tostada (3/5), and a cubano slider (4/5). The MANGO SALSA on top of the empanada was delightful! Tostada was NOT spicy. It was meat, pico de gallo, and guac. The croquette was doused in a light butter sauce and the salmon resonated throughout! Cubano slider was good. This appetizer was hard to split among 5 people.  Fuego House Salad ($11.25) 4/5 Mixed greens, black beans, corn salsa, 1/2 an avocado, pico de gallo, candied walnut, tomato, and tortilla strips with an onion vinaigrette. I think it would have been better if the avocado was sliced in thin slices or cubed instead of two 1/4 pieces, but the cinnamon spiced walnut was really good. Not overly dressed. Simple, somewhat substantial salad. Expensive for no protein.  Coconut Shrimp Martini ($15.25) 3/5 About 6 huge battered prawns nestled with pickled red cabbage in a martini glass. Fun presentation! Well seasoned and sweet. Worth the price? ehhh.  Short Rib Enchiladas ($28) 4/5 I split this dish, and half was the perfect portion. Entrees get 2 sides, so I got the Cornbread (2/5) and Black Beans (3/5). Cornbread was like baked mac n cheese. Supposed to taste like green chile, but I didn't get a hint of it. Black beans were a little watery, but good. Not enough cilantro. Short Rib enchiladas were topped with very complex mole. LOVED IT. All entrees (except the Surf and Turf) come with a side of pickled cabbage, which gave a lot of contrast of texture to our dishes.  Surf and Turf ($30.50) 4.5/5 A huge piece of steak and a massive amount of penne and veggies. We had asked for the steak to be cooked Medium Rare and it came out PERFECTLY. The sauce, however, was just a creamy sauce (the green chile flavor was too subtle). Yes, this was worth it, even though it did NOT come with sides.  Pork Medallions ($26.50) 3.5/5 More like chorizo stuffed rolled pork, but it was delicious. About 5 slices of pork rolls (like sushi) were smothered in a heavy creamy sauce. Good, but again, the red chile was too subtle. We got green beans and black beans for the sides. Nothing special about the green beans (3/5) and the black beans were a little watery (3/5)  Key Lime Pie ($10.25) 3/5 WAY WAY too expensive for a slice of pie NOT a la mode. The good thing, the key lime is not subtle!! Maybe too much key lime. Coffee is necessary to cut the key lime. Ice cream would have brought balance to the force.  Price 3/5 The reason why we didn't LOVE it.   Service 3/5 He checked up on us only at the end. But he was sweet. Shout out to the wonderful busser who kept our waters full!  Come for the vibe and share plates (which are much more expensive than most tapas). I really recommend the Short Rib Enchiladas and Surf N Turf Pasta.",

Initially, I had just bought a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate online since I had some spare credit there and we came during happy hour - they didn't let us use the certificate AND take advantage of the happy hour deal but the happy hour was so nice we didn't mind. Shared a couple cocktails, empanadas, paella, a quesadilla, a plate of nachos, and the berry empanada desert. It wasn't the cheapest dinner/happy hour, but every dish was well executed, not greasy at all, appropriately seasoned, and left you wanting more.  The second meal is what earns this place five stars though - we came during restaurant week.  Holy crap. Most places during restaurant week offer 3 courses for $33 but shrink the courses significantly to make up for the fact you aren't paying full price. Fuego? Four courses plus a glass of sangria, and if the entree wasn't full sized I can't imagine how large it normally is! Where do I even start?  The sangria was tasty. All three of the appetizers (empanada, spicy veggie tostada, cubano slider) were well-seasoned and we could have had more of any of them - but quickly forgot about that as we ate the chicken tortilla soup. I had the pernil asado and my wife had the chile relleno - but both of us got the two included sides as well. I could have gladly filled up on just the cornbread, which was infused throughout with fresh corn. The jalapeno cream corn was well done as well as were the mashed potatoes. I barely had any room left for the desert!  All in all, this is freshly made, tasty food and you'll pay for it - but it's a cute little place that's definitely worth a good date night. I still have yet to use that initial certificate so I'm planning on coming back for sure.",

And would never recommend this place! Never!

I had the Scallops and she tried the Pork... both done to perfection. Try the creamed corn with jalapenos for a side!!!  The menu is simple yet diverse (steak, chicken, pork, shrimp, scallops and fish), and they also offer nightly specials if you burn through the menu too quickly. Highly recommended for a romantic dinner... I will be back to try lunch next time I'm in the area.  This gem is off a side street near 7th and Bethany, and in a courtyard off of that street... Good luck finding it :)   *Thanks goes to Groupon for helping me find this place...",

    "text": "Entree portion sizes are generous. Cheddar mashed potatoes and the green beans were both delicious. I was disappointed in the waitress recommended braised short rib. Good flavor, but meat was a little dry and chewy. Not tender at all. Drinks and appetizers seem to be overpriced, but at happy hour are reasonable. The Reposado margarita tasted great, but didn't seem to have much alcohol and was served in a smaller glass with lots of ice. Empanadas as our appetizer were good, but not great. Lots of meat in a tasty sauce.  Plenty of options for happy hour and very cool that they let you combine happy hour prices with Groupon. My friend got the special, which was a chicken dish that I enjoyed more than my short rib. I love the concept of picking side dishes and portion sizes were great, but wish they had more healthy options. The green beans were just about it. The corn bread had actual chunks of corn in it, which I am not a big fan of. The service was very good. Ambiance is pretty solid too. Only drawback is the main dining area is slightly cramped. Would go again on another Groupon or special occasion otherwise just a bit too pricey regular dining. Overall, a nice experience.",

When we got there we had to wait for the wait staff to find a table.  For a Thursday night the place didn't seem busy but the wait staff couldn't handle the crowd.  After several minutes getting soaked by the misters we finally got a table.  Several minutes later we received our waters and several minutes after that we finally got our Sangria.  The host/waiter seemed very flustered even though the place did not seem too busy.  For my meal I decided on the Organic Spinach Salad.  The salad was perfect for such a warm night.  The bacon citrus vinaigrette dressing and goat cheese were a perfect combination!!    I have heard so many wonderful things about Fuego but my experience was not the best.  The host/waiter kept apologizing which didn't help the situation.  The food was amazing and I will probably go back to give this local place another shot.",

The chili relleno was outstanding, the hard exterior and the outstanding chicken and cheese inside was the perfect Friday lunch, the mai tai just topped it off.  Looking for a good dessert place, Fuego has what you need, the chocolate cake was phenomenal.  Sitting inside was new for me but it was way to hot mid day to sit outside, the interior is just as cute as the outside.  I know I will be back again!",

    "text": "No place does a better job of transporting you from a nondescript commercial corner of central Phoenix to a quaint open air patio of San Juan better then Fuego.  It will utterly surprise you how comfortable that spot is.  It definitely eases you into a singular culinary experience. The menu is relatively small but that's not a problem.  Every dish is percolating with flavor.  The Cuban-southwestern fusion that they've got going on is enough to make Fidel wonder if he should foment a revolution out here....just so he could get closer to these dishes.  The pork dish is on par with the Barrio Cafe Cochinita Pibil in terms of bliss. But the nod goes to Fuego when you consider the incredible sides, namely the jalapeno creamed corn and mashed potatoes.  The tilapia is also an item worth the return visit.   A great restaurant, in my opinion, is a combination of several things namely food, service, and location.  The Fuego excels on all three counts.  Drop by and experience what it is like to escape Phoenix while still being in Phoenix.",

    "text": "We were gifted a Groupon for Fuego and had the pleasure of dining there on Friday night. We did not have a reservation, which would have helped us sit outside, but we were seated inside right away. The host was very pleasant and welcoming.   Much has already been praised about this little gem, and I agree with all of the accolades regarding the atmosphere, the service, the food...it was all wonderful.   We had the Fuego salad, which was huge and lovely (although I would have liked some diced onions on it; maybe I'll ask next time), the tortilla soup (husband raved about this), the Pulled Pork with cheddar chipotle mashed potatoes and maple-glazed carrots, and the panko-breaded chicken breast with creamed jalapeno corn and maple-glazed carrots.   In all it was delectable. The entrees were succulent and nicely plated. I particularly loved the creamed corn, which was perfectly spicy and helped clear by sinuses (I succumbed to a bad cold the next day, so maybe I need some more!).  The only thing I would not order again is the carrots. I didn't feel these added anything to our dinners. The maple taste was pretty subtle, to the point of being nonexistent. Also, I think that if you're going to put yourself out there as an upscale restaurant, go the extra mile and use real carrots instead of the bagged \"baby carrots\" that you can find so readily on cafeteria lines. It will look better.   Our waiter forgot to charge us for the soup. I pointed this out, and he comped us anyway. I will definitely continue to patronize an establishment that empowers its staff to make decisions like that without worrying that they're going to get a dock in pay.  We'll be back, probably first to try out the amazing-looking Happy Hour!",

Thank goodness we tried it because now Fuego Bistro will rank among the few restaurants we make a point to patronize whenever we visit AZ! This is 95% due to the heavenly dish we both ordered: pernil asado, with jalapeno corn bread casserole and maple-glazed baby carrots. The cheapskate in me told my friend who suggested we eat here that, for $25, \"the pork had better be moist and flavorful.\" When the waitress brought our plates packed with shredded pork and sizably-portioned sides, my first bite revealed the juiciest pork I've ever had and it was bursting with porky goodness! The carrots and cornbread were likewise delicious, and half of my meal sufficed as dinner while the other half was reheated and just as yummy for lunch the next day. I can't wait to go back!",

The mojitos are among the best I've ever had. Including the ones I had when I was actually in Havana. Heard the portions were big so we decided against an appetizer, but the empanadas looked delicious.  Ordered the pork and the Fuego Pasta. The sauce that came with the pork was great, but the plate could have come with a couple more tortillas.  Had the chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes and the green chile cornbread casserole. The potatoes were good, with just the right amount of spice, but the cornbread was amazing. Seriously, its one of the beat sides I've had in Phoenix.  I'm a big fan of the Big Rig at Oregano's and the Carlsbad Pasta at Carlsbad Tavern, but the Fuego Pasta might be the best pasta dish I've ever had.  Can't wait to go back during happy hour to try the sliders and pork quesadillas. I can see myself becoming a regular here.",

For my main entree I got the Chile relleno  which has seafood in it and is topped with a creamy lobster sauce. It was amazing. My husband and I agreed that mine was the better dinner of the two (he got the pernil asado). For a side dish I got the green chile cornbread casserole which is very tasty. I also got a small fuego salad which isn't small. It had a delicious dressing on it and was a very good salad. For a drink I got the pomegranate mojito which was ok. It had salt on the rim instead of sugar which I thought was odd. I also got a chocolate espresso drink which was very good. For dessert we got a banana burrito. It is a tortilla wrapped around a banana and chocolate and deep fried. It was served with chocolate malt ice cream, candied nuts and whipped creme. It was very delicious I highly recommend. The only downsides are that the atmosphere could use some improvement. We were outside and our table was dirty. Things appear kind of run down. Also the wait staff isn't dressed very professionally although we received good service. I think it's a little high priced considering those things, but the food is top notch!",

I have been looking for a decent Cubano in Phoenix and have tried a handful of places. This is the best in town that I have found thus far, but the search continues for one as amazing as what I had on a trip to Puerto Rico a few years back.  2. Cost: The prices are a bit high for this part of town. You get what you pay for though.   3. Service: The servers I have had are a mixed bag. One of them was really great and the other was pretty inattentive. She spent most the time conversing with a friend of hers rather than tending to the customers. I overheard a couple at another table complaining about it as well.  4. Atmosphere: Clean. There is only a small indoor section and most of the tables are outside in the courtyard. Keep this in mind on those blisteringly hot Phoenix days.   I gave 4 stars instead of 5 simply due to the waitress being so absent. 4 stars is a good rating and I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants Latin food. I have every intention of coming here again and again as long the food remains so excellent. The owner of this restaurant clearly takes pride in their work and you should try this place out without any hesitation. If you are particularly sensitive to having a good wait staff then you should go elsewhere as it is very unreliable in that department.",

We ate quite a bit earlier in the day and I initially thought of getting there a bit later, ordering later. So our reservation was for 8:30pm, the place is definately hidden. Most tables are outside, three small tables and a very small bar is all that's inside. I thought we could hang out a bit, enjoy the ambience, have a couple drinks and either share a plate or have an appetizer. That would have been lovely.  But, we were seated outside and it was a little cold. I was really looking forward to the live music I had read out. They had a 2 person hillbilly band playing a banjo and washboard, not what I had in mind. We were there, so kinda felt obligated to stay. We ordered the appetizer platter ($16) and the short rib enchiladas (about $27).  The service was attentive. The food was good but overpriced. I didn't enjoy it and wish I'd tried somewhere else for our Saturday night visiting Phoenix.",

The food came out luke warm and every single dish was extremely salty. They have a cute patio and the live music was nice otherwise this restaurant would get 1 star at best. Our bill came out to $45 which I found absurd considering the quality. I so wanted to like this place but will not be returning.",

Her only complaint was that it was made with chicken breast and not thigh meat and the breast was a little dry. My only disappointment was that the horchata bread pudding was dry and cold and instead of a delicious warm tres-leche or horchata type sauce, it came with chocolate ice cream?! very disappointing,  wife had the chocolate cake, it was good but had the same not very flavorful ice cream.   In conclusion, overall the meal was very good, I would recommend this place for very flavorful Latin food, but hold on the desserts!",

Had the house special pasta dish the cornbread appetizer which is a meal unto itself and the New York strip which was the evening special. All of the food was terrific!!  Really look forward to our next visit for the food and cocktails, BUT, the young lady who was our wait person was incredibly slow and in-attentive. Something I don't appreciate when paying for a fine meal. Here is hoping management can fix this issue. I would also suggest selecting a musician who does not have a tin ear for the entertainment. We do look forward to visiting again!",

We arrived just after 4 PM on a Saturday, the back patio was still getting set up, but totally ready for us. Our waitress was very helpful, friendly, and patient. We started with drinks, and social hour appetizers. The cubano sliders, and nachos were simply mouth watering. The mojiti was so fresh and light, I could have sipped them all night!  Then we worked our way on to the dinner menu. Even the sides looked as fantastic as the main courses! All 4 of us ordered different items (chicken, pork tenderloins, short rib enchiladas, and pernilas) and plenty of sides. Everything was above and beyond our expectation!   The musicians were getting set up as we were eating, I only wish we didn't have plans after dinner, or we'd have stayed to hear them. They sounded so whimsical, funky, fun, and eclectic!  The ambiance was magical, and truly tied everything together. I can't wait to return, and will certainly recommend to everyone in this area!",

    "text": "There's really nothing I can say that hasn't already been said except that this is going on my \"Pissed at myself for not trying sooner\" list. Hats off to Lisa E. for making me get my ass in here.  I knew where these guys were located but I had no idea how charming their set-up is with courtyard dining, the main dining room and bar, and the secondary room where we had dinner.   I was able to try the empanadas which were delicious while sipping on my first pomegranate mojito which was dangerously refreshing and delicious. Might have to \"go home sick\" from work some day around Happy Hour!  For my main I had their out-of-this world, mindblowingly awesome special which was seafood risotto: clams, mussels. calamari and shrimp cooked in butter with garlic and herbs, served up with soft, fluffy risotto and tomatoes. Too good for the common man.   It was SO good but there was so much of it that I couldn't finish it, which was nothing short of a tragedy. Our awesome server, Kevin promised to email me if they ever offer it again-apparently it is a rare item. I REALLY hope that they serve it again so because I will be there with bells on!!!! SO good......truly one of the best meals I've had in a while.  I got to try to sample Lisa's chocolate cake which had a chili sauce on it which had just a tad of a kick.....nice balance of sweet and savoury.  Anyway, from all the reviews I am not telling anyone anything they don't already know but I am very glad that I finally made it here. There service was so warm and hospitable that it really added immensely to the whole experience.  This is another one of those hidden gems that make me glad I live in Phoenix.",

We really were looking to unwind after busy family time and this did the trick.  We started with drinks and the house made sangria hit the spot-strong, sweet and refreshing.  My favorite summertime splurge!    The entrees were outrageously delicious-Pernil and Short Rib Enchiladas.  Both delicious, I favored the enchiladas-I love mole!  Paired with the pico-what an amazing combo of flavors.  My favorite thing might be the sides though.  They all sounded way too good to pass up-and they were, with the star being the cornbread.  Some of the best cornbread I've ever tasted!    Whatever you do, do not come here expecting to receive standard Mexican fare (even though tacos, enchiladas and chile rellenos are on the menu).  It's elevated Latin American cuisine with prices to match.  But the explosion of flavors and fun atmosphere will have me returning.  We were delighted to find this spot.",

    "text": "Best random find ever during our trip. We sat in the beautiful patio and it just so happened they have live music and restaurant week was going too (!!!?!!). For $33 per person, we shared a sample of appetizers, had each our own pick or salads and soup, entree, dessert and glass of sangria (score!) or they can make virgin cocktail too. I got the very tasty virgin mojito.   Overall everything was actually quite delicious and well executed. We tried the following: - beef empanada  topped with some amazingly refreshing pico de Gallo or salsa.  - veggie tostada - fresh flavors - a Cuban inspired pork slider- hearty and meaty - the Fuego salad was great. It had some candied nuts too  - the chicken tortilla soup was actually light broth and very delicious. Not heavy or creamy kind but still surprisingly good - the place is known for the pernil (shredded pork) which is a must. It held up to expectations. It came with a sweet sauce to drizzle but I didn't think it needed it.  - the Ropa vieja- tasty enough but I didn't care of it as much as the pernil.  - each entree came with choice of 2 sides so we tried 4. In order of preference: corn bread, chipotle cheese mashed potatoes, jalapeno creamed corn, green beans and almonds. They were all good actually  - the berry empanada with pina colada ice cream was a recent favorite - I wasn't a huge fan cuz the taste reminded me of a pop tart - the bread pudding was not served warm but it was served with a chocolate ice cream that had crispy malt balls.   The waiter was awesome and helpful in giving advise. Great service and food for sure. My only regret is not having a bigger stomach as it was a lot of food and would have liked to try the other small plates from the regular menu.",

    "text": "Fuego Bistro is one of those places where, I think if you know exactly what to order, you'll be very happy with the end result.   Fuego has been on my list for years and for whatever reason, we just never got around to dining here until recently. I largely blame this mostly on my mixed opinion on Latin American cuisine. Not that this place is strictly Latin American, as they seem to kind of do their own thing in many ways.  Playing it safe (probably too safe) with their chips and guac isn't probably your best choice. For 10.50, a bit of guac, salsa, and pico isn't really worth the price, in my opinion.  Now, entrees are a different story. I ordered the pernil asado, which you can pack into some tortillas. The meat boasted some excellent flavor and quality. Additionally, the sides I chose of chipotle cheese mashed potatoes and cornbread were both very unique in comparison to most places. The cornbread here is sweet and chunky. Too chunky for my liking, but still quite satisfying nonetheless.  My girlfriend ordered the empanadas from the small plate section. She thought they were just okay, feeling they would have worked better with my pernil asado as opposed to the somewhat lame ground beef that they use.  Desserts here are a bit odd in the sense the chef/creator seems to really, really like chocolate malted crunch ice cream from Thrifty. I mean, to the point where four of the six offered desserts use it. Not that there's anything wrong with some malted crunch, of course. We opted for the horchata bread pudding, which included scoops of said malted crunch. Not too bad for the asking price.  On a side note, the majority of the restaurant's patrons seem to prefer sitting on their giant patio, which often has me wondering how they handle summer crowds.   Overall, I find Fuego somewhat difficult to rate. The food itself was all executed just fine - to the point where I feel if we returned and experimented with other menu items, there's probably some really great stuff here. But for a first time visit, I'd call it fun, but kind of forgettable.  Recommended to check out.",

I'd order two of these and make it my dinner next time. And since it was our birthdays, for dessert we had the chocolate brownie with ice cream.   All were yummy.     The cornbread and mashed potatoes are the best.   So creamy and thick.   I liked the short ribs that were on the menu prior.   I guess they don't have that anymore and have nor pared the meat down and are using it in the enchiladas.   I'm a meat kinda gal when I'm in the mood for meat so I've always liked it.   Disappointed they no longer have it.  I loved the shrimp.   Definitely I would order it as a meal versus an appetizer.

    "text": "Bought a groupon deal for this place and didn't have any expectations for a scrumptious meal. Lucky for me, I don't have any problems with accepting when I'm undeniably wrong, and ended up having one of the most memorable meal EVER!!  We started with drinks. My kilauea volcano not only looked dashing(see its hotness in my photo-no photoshopping required), but it also had substance! Mmmmm!!! I had a taste of the tortilla soup as well. Let's just say, if my sister wasn't the one who ordered it and was enjoying its hearty flavor, a cat fight would've ensued between us over that oh so heavenly tasting tortilla soup!!  My main squeeze was the 12oz prime new york steak special with almond green beans and cream corn. One word...WOWZA!!! Steak was cooked just right to my liking and succulent in flavor. I will say that I wasn't a fan of the cheese topping on the steak after trying it, but a few scrapings of the cheese off of my steak and voila---back in steak heaven!! :)   We went on a cold Thursday night, but they had warm heaters (maybe a little too warm!) out on their patio. Service was good & a lovely musician serenaded us throughout our entire meal. Overall, it was a pretty spectacular night at fuego bistro!! We were too stuffed to try their dessert, but will definitely be back to get our fill!!",

We are pretty boring as my husband usually orders a meat entree and I always order the seafood chile relleno. However my friends have ordered a variety of items and are never disappointed. The corn bread is SECOND TO NONE. The chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes are also wonderful.  The drink menu is fun and creative and I always try something new.  Love the Peggy Sue and the sangrias. Most important is the way the staff makes you feel when you go there which is so welcoming and friendly. They deserve lots of credit as the staff has remained the same for a long time.  They truly love working there and it shows. We love it because the food is fresh and excellent, the staff is delightful, it is quiet and relaxed. It is guaranteed a wonderful evening for either a date night or a night out with good friends.",

Tried the Fuego Tour to have an opportunity to sample a few of the menu items that sounded amazing. The Cuban slider was to die for, the salmon cake was tender and light, the empanada was seasoned nicely and although the veggie tostada was super  spicy, it had wonderful flavor. The service was great and the live music made this hidden Bistro a wonderful find. Will definitely return!",

    "text": "Fuego is a typical Spanish/Latin inspired hipster restaurant and the price tag to go with it. There is indoor seating and outdoor seating with nice mist machines, which helps combat the smothering heat. The restaurant is bit tucked away, it's next to a hair shop and a blue/gray wall.   We came around 11:30AM on a Friday, which happens to be their \"Social Hour\" = Happy Hour. It wasn't busy at all, we were the only patrons for at least 30 minutes. Perhaps it's more of an evening or night restaurant.   We ordered the:  1. Pernil Asado: Signature pork roast severed with sugar cured cabbage orange habanero mojo, and tortillas (13) -- It was a generous portion size that is enough to share if two people are only moderately hungry  2. Peasant Paella: Shrimp, chicken, chorizo, tilapia in a savory Puerto Rican rice (13) -- The dish had a nice variety but as for texture and flavor, it did not live up to my expectation. I found the rice to be a bit soggy and lacking rich flavors   3. Blue Hawaiian Margarita (10.50): It was cute and topped with a couple pieces of pineapple, cherries, and an umbrella. Alcohol isn't my thing, so I'm not sure what to make of it but I was told it's \"not too strong\"   4. Horchata Bread Pudding (10.25): I'm a sucker for good bread pudding. It was alright but not spiracular or worth the price. I enjoyed the ice cream much more than the bread pudding     TIPS AT FUEGO: 1. Social Hour is 11AM-2PM, 3-6PM, Tuesdays through Saturday and Lunch is from 11AM-2PM 2. They have a Groupon deal, but it's ONLY for entrees: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.groupon.com%2Fdeals%2Ffuego-bistro-fuego-tacos-fuego-cantina-fuego-cityscape-parent-2&s=779b5a809c9b9109d1441bf2194fdfee730c7fdcc9edadb6192dff372384df9d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">groupon.com/deals/fuego-...</a>",

    "text": "Pretty far from our house, so we don't come here often.  Last time we were here everything was great.  Let me start with what wasn't so good.  The singer was too loud, or rather she had the amplifier turned up too high.  Take it off eleven, girl!  And she did all her songs with the same style to the point where they almost sounded the same.  How do you make the Beatles sound the same as Taylor Swift?  And the style she chose made her very pitchy.  Her voice actually squeaked when she tried to go high.  Last time the live music was MUCH better.  Between the volume and the not-good voice, it really detracted from the dining experience.  The food, however, was good.  Pricey, but good.  The Fuego pasta had a nice smoky flavor with a kick.  I sampled the pernil, and it was very good (like last time).  Same for the empanada appetizer.    The paella was a bit disappointing.  Having been to Spain I have had authentic paella, and this wasn't even close.  Even as an 'interpretation' it was pretty weak.  There was a hint of the flavor there, but it was as if they were afraid to emphasize that flavor.  Probably won't order that one again.  One restaurant week entree was ordered also, and it featured a beef dish not on the regular menu, Ropa Vieja.  That dish was pretty good.  Not really \"wow\", but pretty good.  All in all not as good a performance as our last visit.  Especially for the price.  Pretty good, but not much \"wow\".  And you really want \"wow\" at these prices.",

    "text": "Wow, a lot of rave reviews here. Somehow I think that company management has slipped us all a mickey . . . perhaps Uncle Mickey,  because he and Aunt Phylis and all the kids are posting here. That's because I can't find any of this stuff they are raving about.  OK, yes it is hidden and hard to find. But does that by itself make it good? In my opinion, this is one of those restaurants that is making a killing off Groupon and other promotions. I think that we're now seeing a certain type of restaurant emerge that actually LIVES OFF OF those \"daily deal promotions.\" While my wife and I were eating, I saw two other transactions in which someone handed the Groupon coupon to the waiter.   That's OK if its normally priced, or a good deal, because than Groupon is introducing you to something special and you're getting an even better deal. But hey . . . $9 drinks? $5 bottles of beer? These prices at a place where you have to sit on rinky-dink plastic outdoor furniture with wobbly tables just like you might see at the \"patio\" outside some cheazy taco joint or fast food place.  My wife ordered a THIRTEEN DOLLAR appetizer, because it was one of the cheaper things on the menu and it included four scallops that someone had squirted some sauce over. That's it. LIterally gone in four bites. While my dish was larger, and the pork and mashed potatoes tasted good, it just didn't make our expectations after reading Yelp reviews.  I like to support small, hidden out of the way places, and I enjoy the kind of latin fare that this restaurant promotes. But I'd like to see fair treatment of the customer first and foremost. Offering a pint of draft beer at a fair price and a mojito special would be one way to start on that path, Fuego. Reducing your dependency upon the \"jack up the price and then offer them a Groupon discount\" would be a second suggestion.",

But don't get me wrong, the atmosphere is great.  Tonight they had all the indoor tables from around the bar outside since the weather was nice.  Add in the live music and all the friendly staff and it makes for a great night out.  As a complete side note, my wife noticed that the bathroom door has a mail slot in it.  Who knows what this place was before it was Fuego Bistro.   The food?  Well Jeff, the owner, will most likely stop by your table and sell you really hard on something.  Not in a bad sort of way, I believe the guy is just really exciting about his food on a regular basis.  The good news is he isn't full of it, all the food has been great that I've tried.  Tonight he suggested the special, a seafood chile relleno.  Fried goodness with a great spicy finish to it.    The only possible downside would be the prices.  If it were any cheaper I would be a serious regular there.  But there is always a special of some kind going on.  I got our mojitos discounted just for mentioning Yelp tonight.  The last time I used a groupon.  So shop around for coupons before you go.",

The food was phenomenal - I had the Tilapia and my lovely companion had some sort of stuffed chicken deal that was too complicated for me to figure out.   The drinks are strong for being in a restaurant - a huge plus for me.  The mojito is definitely worth a shot.    Take great food, a great atmosphere, attentive wait staff, and throw in a guy playing acoustic covers of slower indie songs (think Decemberists) and you've got a winning combination!",

I tried their special seafood enchiladas which were stuffed with goat cheese, shrimp, crab and scallops, all topped with a creamy tomatillo sauce.  YUM. The creamed corn and chipotle mashed potatoes, also YUM.  We sat on the patio and watched a dance class happen next door.  My one and only complaint.... the table.  The actual table itself.  It was wooden, and very pokey.  Like, we all thought we were going to get splinters.  Not nice.",

    "text": "I find it hilarious that someone would reference this place as being terrible,  compare it to (overpriced and bland) Humble Pie, and in the same breath say it was the best chili relleno you ever tasted.   I can't vouch for the chicken tacos but most street tacos are nowhere near packed with meat. By definition they are usually very tiny with onions,some guacamole, a little cabbage, and some small cuts of meat.  I can say the tilapia tacos are tops(large filet on each) on the list of my girlfriend's quest for good fish tacos. I can say the pork nachos are the best I have had as the pork reminds me of Los Dos Molinos in a small way. The empanadas are excellent as well.  If you go for happy hour you can get two empanadas for 6 bucks. You can also get 2 large fish tacos for 6 bucks. Would you like some awesome tortilla soup? 4 bucks. If you get the dinner version of the emapanadas with a large portion of some of the best rice and a side of black beans I think it sets you back about 11 bucks. I have also had the chili relleno and it is the best I have tasted as well leaving me to wonder with the single review you have for anything, why the venom?  I learned long ago to ask for what is recommended for before you order and if someone recommends a place try what they are harping about first. When I asked they said the chili relleno, pork, empanadas, and red sangrias. Guess how my dining experience went? Try ordering tacos from Los Dos Molinos and you will leave pissed. Order the green chili pork and you will drive 100 miles for it.  I do hope you give it another chance I have honestly never had anything sub par here in my 7 or so visits and they seriously could charge way more for quality than they do.  I agree that Main Ingredient is great also, that's why I took the time to write about it.   But to reiterate:  11-13 dollar for most dinner items besides new york strip(on the list to try), is not pricey  happy hour has most items for 4-6$  street tacos are not bursting with meat  ask what is the best thing on the menu when you order some place then you can write it off all you want.  Humble Pie  was more pricey and not worth it, All it does is take up parking from a much better place next door. For a place with the reference to pizza in it's name you would think it would be better, it tasted like peter piper.  I would love to know what a good chicken taco is in your opinion, I cant think of any besides maybe the California tacos at the now closed Chuy's, but the ones my sister ordered from here were full of chicken and topped with a nice chipotle/ranch like sauce which is similar.",

    "text": "My partner brought me here for what we thought would be a nice, romantic birthday dinner at a cozy neighborhood spot. We hadn't been in a year or so, and were both disappointed - here's the good + bad:  The good: 1. Shared plate #1 - slow-roasted pork, green chile cornbread casserole and maple-glazed carrots were all excellent, especially the pork which was so flavorful. Would have this again in an instant. 2. Classic lime mojito - very good if not just a bit sweet (but see point about drinks below) 3. The happy hour menu - 1/3 of the dinner page - looked great. 3-6pm, may have to give that a try instead of dinner  The bad: 1. Place was empty at 8pm - just one other table inside besides us (plus one guy at bar, one table on patio) 2. No music until halfway through dinner - then The Cure, Violent Femmes and other 80s alternative - which I like, but not in a sit-down restaurant for dinner. And the bartender sang along occasionally - ugh. 3. Mixed drinks in a pint glass - never a fan unless at a dive bar. 4. Out appetizer never came - waiter said he didn't remember us ordering even though he commented that the dish was good when we ordered. With just one other table, a big disappointment. (to his partial credit, he did bring us A SMALL PORTION of the appetizer with our entrees for free) 5. Shared plate #2 - new york strip, cheddar mashed potatoes and organic green beans were all just OK. Not a fan of the sauce the steak was in, and topping of mushrooms, onions and peppers too heavy. Way too much mashed potatoes and green beans, which were both pretty bland. 6. Toward the end of our meal, a young boy came into the restaurant and started playing with a ball right next to our table. I am not joking. wtf?  Overall, I'd like to think we just experienced an off-night here. But, attention to details like mood and music  (plus getting everything you ordered) are also important. Some of the food was very good, so we may give it another try sometime - but, truthfully, I think there are a number of better restaurants in the area.",

I had the stuffed chili relleno and my husband had the pork asado.  Both tasted amazing.  We also had the horchata bread pudding for dessert.  It was good and not too sweet.

I had the chili relleno plate and the sauce was delish. The breading was too thick for my liking but it was good. I believe they used a poblano chili, which was different from my Mexican cuisine expectations but I enjoyed the difference. It was stuffed with cheese and chicken. The rice was fantastic. If I can duplicate it at home I will. That may require a few more visits, though. My dining mate had the pork carnitas tacos and the meat was delish. I'll try next time, for sure!",

    "text": "Long ago, I went to a great little cafe in uptown Phoenix. We had dinner in a courtyard with a fountain, live music, and a ballet school next to it. I couldn't remember what the place was called or where it was at to save my life. So I never returned...  Years later, I started my search to go back to that great little cafe, only to find out it changed to Fuego Bistro. I was sad at first, until I saw the menu online. Soooooo up my alley. I love delicious spicy mixes of Latin and American cuisines. Restaurant week came and Fuego was on the list and they were including a cocktail with our 3 course dinner. Hells yeah!! Definitely my kind of place!  Here's the meal rundown:  1st course: I got the empanada. So sad it wasn't empanadas. I could eat these for every meal for the rest of my life and never once complain of monotony. My buddy got the tostadas. Lucky him, he got two. I stole some of his beef that was on top and it was melt in my mouth delicious. So far, 2 for 2.  2nd course: I got the chili relleno with jalapeno creamed corn and chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes. O-M-G!!!! I don't even know where to start. The corn definitely had a kick and was made sweet white corn which added a nice balance to the spice. I have since bought sweet white corn and jalapenos to try to recreate these. It won't be as good; but that just means I'll be heading back. If I could make mashed potatoes this good, I'd move to Idaho. The chili relleno was bomb-diggity. Chicken, black beans, cheese, love.  My friend had the signature pernil asado and the same sides as me. I hardly got the chance to try his he ate it so fast. Signature for a reason. YUMMMMMMY!  Score: 4 for 4.  3rd course: I got the horchata chocolate chip bread pudding. I was so full I could not fully appreciate this giant plate of wonderfulness. My friend got the creme brulee and it was just as fantastic, but I'm going to say this round goes to the bread pudding.  6 for 6.  As for the included cocktail, I had the white sangria. I love sangria. It was a perfect blend of sweet and crisp and didn't have too much fruit or wine flavor to it. It was strong and I could only make it through one.  The server was super friendly, the atmosphere fantastic, the food to die for, and the drinks strong and delicious. I'm surprised this place isn't constantly packed with an hour wait. Definitely a new favorite. I'm so happy it's not that old cafe I was searching for.",

The location is not the best, but what was lacking in appearance, certainly made up for it with the food that was served.  The decor inside of the restaurant is very well put together.  Somewhat, a kind of modern mexican feel.    I ordered the Cola and Pineapple Soy Braised Angus Short Rib Roast.  A great choice that I will definitely order again.  The meat was so tender and melted in your mouth.  The spices were spot on.  I paired it with the green chili cornbread casserole and chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes.  Both of which were amazing.  My fiance had the pernil asado.  This was also very good, but was not my favorite of the two.  Although, I don't really eat pork.  Overall, I would definitely recommend.  If you plan on going, get reservations, or you might end up having to sit at the bar.  Its a small place.  Sometimes so busy that they never answer their phone (something they can probably improve on).",

I am just assuming they are simply angry elves and will never be pleased, perhaps they were never loved as kids or just need a hug...but pay no attention to them.  This place is amazing!  It's quirky, charming, hidden, sort of a tex-mex latin fusion, but at any rate- it's just plain good!   Definitely try some of the different mojito flavors, I think pomegranate was our favorite.  It's easy to rack up a bill at this place with the entrees, but I've heard they have great happy hour deals so check that out.  About the restaurant itself- it really doesn't look like one from the street.  It is a bit hidden.  The restaurant inside is smaller, but very cute.  Personally I prefer the patio/courtyard, although I haven't been there recently I am assuming they have space heaters set out.  Each time we have eaten here we have the same waitress, who is just as quirky and charming as the restaurant itself, loved her, she just seemed like the happiest person on earth lol!  The owner also stopped by on one occasion, incredibly nice and personable.   In short, go there and try it.  It might not be your style if you don't care for the tex-mex latin cuisine or if you are an angry elf person who cannot be pleased :)  LOL- look at the one person that gave this place a 1 star rating, angry elf!",

I arrived on the menu for Fuego Bistro and after reading the reviews on yelp decided this was THE PLACE.   We arrived around 7pm and were somewhat confused where to park, but after we did, we found the restaurant entrance and were seated. The host was very friendly and proactively saw our table was shaky and fixed it for us. They have a nice area for sitting outside and had live music, which was quite enjoyable. It did take our waitress awhile to greet us and take our drink order, but other than that slowness at the beginning, the rest of the service was good. Also, something I really enjoy is when the servers are passionate about the food they are serving and at Fuego, that definitely came across.   Now, the most important part, the food. It was excellent. We tried a bit of everything since it was restaurant week. I really liked the nachos (which were HUGE) and empanada. The pasta was excellent, with a nice kick and the chorizo was a great touch. The corn casserole is to die for! Dessert was OK in my opinion, but the appetizers and main courses for surpassed the dessert.   To sum things up, Fuego is a fun, unique restaurant with great food and passionate service.",

Both of our dishes were very flavorful and tasty.  We also tried the banana burrito for dessert, which was perfect!  I couldn't have asked for a better tasting meal.  The service was very warm and attentive.  We had a groupon, which helped with the bill, as it was on the pricier side (average $20-25 a plate).  It still would have been worth it to me.  They even gave us a BOGO flier after we paid!  I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Ok-It pains me to have to take away a star. Dined here on Saturday. The service was really awkward and everything was a little off including the food which my dining companion noted did not \"wow\" him this time. I had to agree that mine was not quite as tasty as usual. I would have loved a second cocktail but our server disappeared so by that time our dinner was well over so we just decided to go somewhere else for that second drink. There were also two couples waiting for a table that just kind of loitered in our vicinity. It was strange being stared down for a table at Fuego. I am not willing to write Fuego off yet as I loved it so. I am really hoping it was just an \"off\" night. I don't think I can persuade my dinner date to go back there anytime soon but it is still on my list of faves.",

The only thing was the groupon was only valid for din din... bummer  Although it was Friday and I was in a Happy Mood and decided to stay for lunch. We decided to sit at the bar and familiarize ourselves with the lunch drink menu. I would have to recommend the Mojito. For the lil' drinker in you, choose the white sangria over the red (I heard it has more alcohol in it)  But for the tummy I would shout out the recommendation of the Tostadas! The were amazing! I hope you are not allergic to avocado because instead of refried beans the avocado is the base of this lovely snack. I only ordered one portion that was probably the only thing I was upset with. I can't wait to head back for din din to use my groupon",

This was some extremely tasty business! I started off with the pork bbq sliders. Two came on a plate, and it was a heaping full of meat. I shared it with the rest of the table. My wife got the empanadas and they were very good as well.  For main course I got the chicken breast with the chipotle mashed potatoes, and jalepeno cornbread. One of the best meals I have had in a long time. There was a lot of different flavors that were playing in this dish, and I loved it!  Half the table got great service, the other half not so good. My drink was forgotten, my meal didnt come out with everyone elses... But she made up for it in the end, so its all good in my book! :)  My only complaint is that they dont have a very vibrant bar scene. Their specialty is mojitos, so if you love them, this is your place! My wife said it was the best mojito she had ever had, a blood orange mojito.",

I can't believe that Fuego seems to remain a well-kept secret... it is really fantastic.  The guitar player-singer that was there this evening was great - such a nice surprise!  Husband and I were greeted by the host upon our arrival.  I LOVED him.  What an awesome, vibrant personality... and he recommended a killer peach-grapefruit mojito - mmmm!  We shared the Salmon Croquettes, Empanadas, and the delicious Chicken dinner (I'm sure it had a name...).  All of the dishes were presented beautifully, had fantastic flavor, and persuaded us to not only clean out plates, but to order dessert too!  The side dishes of jalapeno creamed corn and green chile cornbread casserole were SO good.  I would have ordered a dinner made up strictly of side dishes, had that been an option... the maple-chili glazed carrots and chipotle mashed potatoes were also calling my name, but they'll have to wait for my next visit.  We finished up with the Horchata Bread Pudding.  Yum!  I liked the contrasting texture of the fried and sugared flour tortilla strips on top.    During our meal, we had fantastic service.  They took their time, and we never felt rushed... which is a change from many restaurants around town.  We really felt like we could sit back, enjoy the music, and chill as long as we wanted to.  I'm looking forward to a return visit... probably for Happy Hour very soon(how can you turn down those prices?!).",

We shared the braised short ribs and pulled pork with creamed corn, mashed potatoes, cornbread casserole and baby carrots. Absolutely divine! The flavors all melded together perfectly and was filling but not greasy.   If you haven't been yet, go check this place out. Its a real treasure worth the hunt.",

I have to admit, this place intrigued me because of the \"mention Yelp & receive 20% off\" offer. And I am so glad I decided to try it out!  Fuego Bistro is hidden away inside an older looking complex. The inside is very small but they do have additional space in the patio out front.  Our waitress, Suzie I believe, was very sweet! She was very good about refilling our drinks & asked how everything was.  For my entree I ordered their Signature Empanadas & for my Hubby's entree he ordered the Fuego Enchiladas, both came with a side of rice & black beans. The empanadas were so delicious, there were so many flavors going on it was amazing. Hubs said his enchiladas were delicious as well, some of the best he's ever had. I had to order the Captain Morgan Banana Burrito for dessert even though it was lunch time. I am SO glad I did, it was one of the BEST desserts I've ever had & I am a dessert junkie.  They have a rather large bar for such a small space so I definitely want to come back for happy hour & dinner sometime. This is my new favorite place!",

Nachos were standard (its hard to mess it up right?), the fish tacos were very good.  Nothing very crazy different here.    The next time we went we perused the dinner menu and got the FB pasta dish and the short rib.  The short ribs were very good, not overly fatty, easily came apart.  And they were even better reheated.  I got the creamed corn and the corn bread casserole as sides - interesting and pretty tasty.  The pasta dish was kinda oily, but the portion is pretty big.  I wasn't a big fan and I'm sure it was very \"expensive\" calorie-wise.  This place is very tucked away and \"cozy\" meaning 9 tables and a bar.  There are a couple more tables on the patio area, but in the room that is it.  They share the bathroom with the rest of the complex.  Not complaining, I've seen places like these in California and such.  Just wanted to be clear since you can fit 50 people sometimes in \"cozy\" places and this place definitely cannot.  Its also in kind of a bad location with confusing parking arrangements.  All in all, the food is pretty good, but the prices are too high to justify getting dinner there.  (The dinner entrees were about 25 each).  I would go back for lunch or happy hour since the food is pretty good and the items on these menus are priced pretty appropriately.  I can think of a lot of other places that would be worth 60+ money for dinner..",

The steak was delicious, thick and juicy, cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor and spice.   The restaurant itself is tiny (which I like) but also has open patio seating. Make a reservation if you want a table inside. Or if you're a native Phoenician like me who loves sitting on a patio on warm summer nights under a cooling mist, then no reservation is needed.   Staff was friendly and kept my water full. (Bonus points for that!) I'll try to go back for happy hour soon. I'll be taking my out of town friends here as well. It's a triumph.",

My hubby and I found ourselves cooing to one another and holding hands while listening to the musician play Simon Garfunkel oldies.    The wait staff at the restaurant were top notch.  Friendly, nice, and they helped one another out by re-filling empty glasses and checking on customers.  The wait staff can make or break a joint.    The food was good.  We had the ribs with fresh green beans (crunchy and yummy) and mashed potatoes.  We also had the crusted tilapia.  The tilapia must have been substituted with halibut.  This dish presentation was beautiful however the flavor was a little lackluster.  I think the fish was not seasoned prior to cooking.  The creamed corn was amazing!!  I could have had this for dessert.    We ended the meal with a chocolate torte.  The torte itself was lovely.  Rich and decadent.  However I don't know that I was a fan of the pumpkin ice cream and the berry sauce.  The chocolate sauce was much better - wish there was more of that instead.   Portions here are huge!  I noticed several people had to-go boxes.    Overall the experience and the food were great and I would love to go back soon.",

    "text": "My BF and I just happened to come here for dinner during restaurant week so I was happy to see the $30 prix fix menu for appetizer, main meal, dessert and sangria or soft drink. We were seated on the patio and I loved the ambiance, the warmth, soft lighting and a guitarist who must have known every singer/songwriter song ever written. OK admit I liked him because he played Dylan and Leonard Cohen among others. I was enjoying the vibe until, as the evening grew darker, I realized we could not see our food, like, at all. A single small candle was not adequate to light our table. That really is my only complaint and I think it is repairable. It was hard to love on my food when I seriously couldn't tell what was what. So much effort clearly went into making the food, so come on, let's see it. My other comment is the serving sizes. I expected that a menu such as the restaurant week menu might have smaller servings and they definitely could have. Nearly everyone I saw leaving was taking a box with them, as we did. With full size appetizers, we only ate half of our full sized main dishes. BF had to bring his dessert home, although I pressed on to try the chocolate chile torte with the most amazing malt and coconut ice cream. Not seeing it added a kind of different taste dimension which wasn't Unpleasant but it was a bit unusual. I enjoyed all of the food but the big hits for me were the renowned pork pernil and the corn bread casserole thingy...well it's not typical cornbread but very rich and home style with chiles and other unseen bits. Will go back next time I'm in Phoenix but will likely see if we can split a meal, saving room for the excellent desserts.  Last, not least, I found the texting reservations very easy and a great idea for those places that may not want to deal with Open Table.",

    "text": "The short: Mouthwatering Cuban-influenced cuisine, awesome service, cute and warmly decorated space with a cool mix of art all over the walls. This is a restaurant I'll be going back to.   The long:  Fuego Bistro is off the east side of 7th St., just south of Bethany Home. Keep an eye out for the sign that says Apollo and turn in just north of that building. Fuego Bistro is next door to Apollo, and the small main parking lot is on the east side of the restaurant, but there's parking, sometimes makeshift, up and down Palo Verde Dr. If you're brave, or dumb, you can try to use the spot with the power pole growing out of it.   I liked the look of the place--not too loud (visually or otherwise), and cozy without looking homely. I love the art there. The diners represented an even spread, which is always nice to see. The restaurant smelled like pork, but not in a scary way--it smelled like their famous pernil asado. The host was friendly, and the rest of the service staff was wonderful--fast, efficient, and totally unobtrusive, sliding silverware and refills in as needed before slipping quietly away, doing quality control checks after we'd taken a couple of bites of each course. That was especially impressive, considering out table was just big enough for the two of us.   We split the appetizers. First we had the green chile cheeseburger empanadas with Yucatan BBQ Sauce, and fresh pico de gallo. While a lot of food can get by solely on the merit of being fried as long as they're fried well, as these were, the filling and accompaniments were so yummy. All the flavors melded together beautifully, and the pico de gallo added the fresh zest and bright flavor I wanted to start off the meal. We also had the Ancho-dusted Pacific wild salmon croquette with fresh capers and lemon buerre blanc. This was also well done and tasty, though it took a backseat to the empanada for me.   My entree was the signature pernil asado, which the restaurant describes as \"slow roasted succulent pork shoulder with a mango habanero mojo sauce.\" And it absolutely was as mouthwatering as its description implies. This was as good as any pernil asado I've ever had, and while I can't attest to Fuego Bistro's recipe, I can definitely say it tasted like a hunk of luscious meat that's been marinated overnight and roasted low and slow for 5 or 6 hours before landing on my plate. *sigh* It came with a continuous supply of little flour tortillas, tasty chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes, and perfectly cooked and delicious sauteed organic green beans.   My boyfriend has the Fuego chile relleno, which was stuffed with \"Natural Chicken, Black Bean, arroz, Oaxacan cheese, Penko Breaded in a Guajillo Chile Sauce.\" This dish was also really good and well cooked, but I was more impressed with his side dishes--a highly addictive green chili cornbread casserole and maple chiliglazed carrots, which were the best cooked carrots I've ever had. Between my green beans and his carrots, I was totally happy. If you make veggies as if they were a boring obligation or afterthought, you lose major points. I eat my veggies first before any other part of the entree, and if I don't want to go into my main dish feeling sad. Fuego Bistro does veggies right.   For dessert, we had the Ancho dusted chocolate torte and the horchata chocolate chip bread pudding. Dessert's often the highlight of a dinner out for me, and while both were good in this case with the chocolate torte being my choice, it doesn't bother me at all that the first and second courses were the stars of the meal. Bonus points for the bartender who was so willing and gracious as to translate their extensive mojito menu into virgin drinks for us, since we weren't drinking that night. We would not turn down another round of watermelon and mango mojitos, and I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu.",

The manager/owner was snippy that we didn't have a reservation (we didn't know it was a special week), the server was snippy, and they seemed to be trying to hurry us out so they could move more people in. They kept pointing out that they had 200 reservations in a single night. Ok...good for you, but it would be better to take fewer and give them all good service than take too many and be stressed and unpleasant. We'll give it another try, because the food is good and they have THE MOST AWESOME live music there sometimes (a duo called Joe and Jess), but we'll be sure to check ahead of time to see if they're busy...and if they are, we won't bother.",

    "text": "Our dinner at Fuego Bistro last night was stellar.   Our mission: to explore Cuban-inspired meals for an upcoming Cuban party. We accepted with glee, and we finished with happy, full bellies.   First things first: drinks. Three of us ordered a different type of mojito: mango, blood orange and pomegranate. I had the mango mojito, and it was very good, but I could really only have one because it was rather sweet. My friend Cara doesn't do rum, so she got her signature margarita ... sort of. Our waitress, Suzie, was fantastic. \"Oh, you want the skinny girl margarita - I'll take care of you, don't worry.\" Her other famous line of the night was, \"Don't worry, if you don't like your drink, I'll drink it for you and we'll make you another.\" When we DID like our drinks, it was \"Oh, so I guess I'm staying sober tonight.\"   The four of us shared the signature empanadas and the jumbo sauteed prawns - both very good.   For dinner, I ordered the Natural Farm Chicken Breast: pounded, panko breaded in a sauce of tomatillo cream, goat cheese, bacon and tortilla pico de gallo. I chose the Green Chili Cornbread Casserole and Sauteed Organic Green Beans for my sides. Half of the meal is sitting in my fridge right now, waiting for me to visit it at lunch time. The portions were so huge!  The rest of the table featured the Cola and Pineapple Soy Braised Angus Short Rib Roast, the Signature Pernil Asado, the Homemade Tortilla Soup and the Fuego Salad. Two thumbs up from every diner. And, I was not the only one who went home with leftovers.   My husband gets some Yelp brownie points for telling our waitress, \"My wife here, she's a big time yelper. She'll write a great review of this place tomorrow. \" Suzie said, \"I'm glad you just mentioned Yelp because now I can take 20% off your bill.\" And she did.   Fuego Bistro IS tucked away - be sure you have clear directions with you. You can't expect to see if from a main road like 7th Street.   Enjoy!",

    "text": "I have to agree with the folks giving Fuego two stars. I've been twice and it's not hard to find at all if you've lived in Phoenix for more than 5 minutes and can read an address. Geez.   The first time, I ate lunch at Fuego. I don't remember what I ate, but it was not bad! I would have remembered if I didn't like it--it just didn't stand out in my mind like the mac'n'cheese at Main Ingredient or the baked cookie dough at Switch, or the oh, so delicious garlic fries at Humble Pie. We ate inside that first time and there was only one person on duty, so the service was slow, but as we were not in a hurry, it didn't matter.  More recently, my mother and I took an out-of-town friend to dinner at Fuego and my experience was disappointing enough to warrant this review. Not our waiter, though--Steve was AWESOME. Very attentive and friendly. He earns one star for the place just by showing up at the table with a great attitude! The ambience was fine--we already knew what to expect, so no disappointments, there, either.   But what do we go out to dinner FOR??? It's the Food. The FOOD we pay for needs to be GOOD, especially at those high prices! Well, the flavors were there. The cooks are decent at flavors, but the chicken in my so-called \"street\" tacos was so dry, I couldn't eat them.  Also, they are nothing like real street tacos, which, in inner-city Phoenix, is what I was expecting. REAL street tacos are small, warm, double corn tortillas, filled with soft, juicy meat and topped with things like red onions, lettuce, tomatoes, or CHEESE!!! There was none of that, just a big wad of gross, pickled red cabbage and a tiny dab of some pink sauce that was so insufficient that I couldn't tell you if it was tasty or not. What I can tell you is that my single-layer, cold, raw, 6-inch tortillas were filled with  very, very dry grilled chicken. I took a piece of chicken out to taste it separately. It had been marinated in something tasty, but it lacked any sort of moisture and I wished we had gone somewhere else.  Judging by the tacos alone, I would have rated Fuego only that one previously mentioned star, but I took a bite of my mom's chili relleno and it was the best I've ever tasted anywhere. Bravo for that, Fuego! And an extra star, just for giving my mom a good dinner.",

The Bistro, especially, has something that tends to fall flat in Phoenix--great service.  Steve and Kevin are both experienced waiters that know their customers and provide top notch but unintrusive service.  When you return, the waiters know you, and even remember your likes and dislikes.  The Pernil Assado is by far my favoite dish, and I haven't had a side that isn't great.  They also have a fne happy hour menu with reduced price small plates and deserts, and you can make a meal out of 2 or 3 appetizers and a cocktail.  A little hard to find the first time, but worth the try.",

Silly me, I was not really expecting a Bistro, for some reason I was expecting something fancier with white linen table cloths or something like that for the price point. I felt overdressed. Well the candlelight was a nice romantic touch.  We had a reservation and were seated immediately upon arrival at the corner table. There was live music on the patio which I always enjoy.  Our waitress was nice and attentive. The busboys were also on top of their job which was great, I hate having dirty plates just sitting there while I'm chatting. We ordered off the special RW menu which came with a glass of sangria. I tried the white sangria which was light and fruity. I ordered the tostada for an appetizer and the boyfriend had the empanada. Both were pretty tasty. For Course 2 the boyfriend got the steak and cheddar mashed potatoes and I got the Seafood Chile Relleno with yummy cream corn and the most delicious cornbread. Both meals were good, no complaints but the portions were huge, we didn't even finish half of our meals. I got them to go. But not before having dinner, I got the chocolate bread pudding and he got the Banana Burrito. I didn't like the Banana Burrito. The bread pudding almost tasted bland but that could because I had so many different flavors in my Course 2 dishes. Anyway, I think I am not that partial to latin food so maybe that's why everything was just A-OK for me, not spectacular. It was worth the try though.",

    "text": "I don't write reviews too often, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to share how great Fuego Bistro is.  I found out about Fuego Bistro through a Groupon and what originally got my attention was the mojitos.  While dining here, I enjoyed two fabulous mojitos, an original lime and one blood orange, which were both quite tasty.   They have several different flavors and quite the selection of rum.  However, it wasn't just the mojitos that I enjoyed.  I happen to go during Restaurant week and had a three course meal consisting of Mini-Vegetarian Tostadas, their Signature Pernil Asado with Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes and Green Chile Corn Bread Casserole.  I also sampled the empanadas as a friend of mine had those for an appetizer.    Oh my goodness, every single bite I had was fabulous...and I think I stopped to say that every time I had a bite, I couldn't stop talking about how delicious everything tasted. The Signature Pernil Asado - basically slow roasted pork shoulder (24 hours according to the waiter) was the best shredded pork I've eaten at any restaurant.  It was so tender and extremely juicy which doesn't happen very often.  To top that off, the chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes were creamy and accompanied the pork perfectly.  I wasn't expecting perfection from the corn bread casserole, but this also exceeded any expectations I've ever had of corn bread.  You could actually taste the green chili in the corn bread and it had the consistency of a fresh baked brownie which may sound weird but was some of the best corn bread I've ever had as I was expecting something rather dry and not to flavorful.  To put it simply, everything was spectacular.  I haven't stopped talking about this place since I went, it's a must try and I know I'll be going back real soon!",

I had made reservations in advance and we still waited about 25 mins to be seated, the host even forgot that we checked in. It seemed very busy that night and it's a small place to begin with so crowded as well. They may have been under staffed that night.  While we were waiting for our table we both had drinks, I had a coconut mojito and Javier had another specialty drink. They tasted great but there was very little alcohol in them, I would of liked some more in there for $10 per drink. Once we got seated we ordered and got our food, it came out faster than I thought considering how busy it was. Javier ordered the seafood Chile relleno with chipotle mashed potatoes and corn bread; I had the same sides with the cola pineapple soy short ribs. Our food was great and the portions were Huge. We had enough to take home and eat the next day. The food its self was so good I am willing to overlook the mishaps earlier in the evening. For dessert we had the Kahlua creme brulee, this is my favorite dessert and this one did not disappoint me.  We will be going back again but not anytime soon, this is another issue. They only have patio seating which I normally love, but not during the summer in AZ. So we will be back when the weather permits.",

Started things off with a mojito, which was very refreshing and quite large.  I've been a bit of a light weight since dialing back the carbs, and spent most of the meal with a healthy buzz - it didn't help that we skipped the appetizer.  Onto the meal - I got the asado, which was served up as a pleasant tasting mound of pulled pork.  The 3 small tortillas paired with the dish couldn't hold up to the juiciness and broke apart into mush, but I enjoyed my meal anyways.  I chose cornbread and creamed corn as my sides - both to die for, though I did kinda regret doubling up on the corn.  My wife got the short rib enchiladas - again, a mostly delicious dish, though the mole sauce was a bit to strong and she had to scrape some off to the side.  We finished with the bread pudding - it was good, but also my least favorite part of the meal. It's paired with a strong, chocolate ice cream - probably heaven for chocolate lovers, but I felt it overpowered the pudding.",

We came in pretty late so we were one of the last tables there that night, but the staff never made us feel unwelcome (which can happen when you're the only reason they still have to be at work.) Our server (though I wonder if he was also the owner or manager) was extremely helpful and personable. I think his conversation and service was one of the reasons we had such a great time. Gave us a lot of great suggestions on the menu and drinks.   I had the ahi tuna and he had the feugo pasta. Both dishes had a perfectly pleasant amount of spice to my taste - enough to bite but not enough to be overwhelming or uncomfortable.  They also have amazing mojitos. I had the blood orange flavor but I liked the prickly pear flavor better so if you go, try that one.   After dinner I wanted a coffee, rather than a whole dessert, and was disappointed they didn't serve any. But our waiter improvised a coffee cocktail that was absolutely delicious and I appreciated the effort rather than simply saying \"we don't have it.\"  As we were leaving our server was telling us about a comedy night they do on Tuesdays that sounds pretty fun (apparently it goes for the next three weeks) - might have to go back to check it out. It's supposed to include happy hour pricing on the drinks and menu.  All in all I fell in love with this place and would definitely come back. It's a little pricey for it to be a regular place for me but they seem to do a lot of specials and discounts which make it a bit more affordable.",

If you go for dinner, get the Southwest Crab Cakes and regardless of when you go or  what you get, leave room for desert. Or be really naughty and just get desert! They are all sinful and totally worth the calories!!!  Service is typically quite good. If you go when it isn't fire truck'n hot, sit outside and enjoy the lovely patio. It's less claustrophobic than the intimate interior and has a more relaxed feeling. And if you go on Friday or Saturday nights, they have some great live jazz to spice things up even more.   One last thing that I beleive makes them unique is that in addition to normal catering services, they will do mid-week business lunches. For anyone that has to pull together meal options for meetings, this is one sure hit!",

    "text": "*Update- Their leftovers make a good meal the next day. Actually, I think I enjoyed them more than I did when I was there!   I was really excited to go to Fuego Bistro on one of the last days of AZ Restaurant week. However, I left feeling like I was missing something.  The choices for the three courses sound and look really good on paper but must have been mistranslated.  I had the classic Fuego Empanadas, the chicken with cheddar chipotle mashed potatoes and green beans, and the cream cheese flan.  First, the empanadas. While the filling was delicious, it wasn't any better than my mother's picadillo (which says a lot because she isn't the world's best cook) and the empanada itself tasted...off. I think the flour they use could be better. It just had a very bleached baking flour taste to it. I did like the corn/black bean/cheese mix on top and the sauce that accompanies it was very tasty.  The chicken with apricots and goat cheese was next. I have to give them major credit for the cheddar chipotle mashed potatoes, the chicken was a little dry and the goat cheese was tasteless. I really thought that the apricot or the mushroom would give it a flavor but no. However, the balsamic sauce on top was delightful. You SHOULD try the potatoes.   Finally, the flan. I did enjoy the flan but I wonder why they make it so thick. I don't like a watery flan as much as the next person, but this was pretty thick! The sweet marmalade type sauce (I believe it was raspberry) confused me but I still wanted to take a finger and lick it off the plate.  On a side note, perhaps it is my single-ness coming out, but there were some obnoxious kids running around. This normally doesn't bother me, but one in particular would start to cry for what seemed to be no reason at all. I put \"good for kids\" because the owner/waitresses/staff did not seem to mind them.   Overall- Not amazing, but still decent. I'd go again if my boyfriend paid for me and maybe order a seafood dish. The staff was great, very friendly and super attentive.",

    "text": "Two words of advice:  1) Turn into the parking lot to the east of the building.  Walk right into the Fuego patio.  2) Go veerrry hungry, the portions are huge.  A friend and I went for dinner on a Groupon.  It was happy hour, but since the Groupon required two entrees, we didn't get appetizers.  However, some of the dessert items are on the happy hour menu, so we ordered one at the HH price, for consumption later.  This was typical of the cooperative and friendly service during our whole visit.  Everything was topnotch and my friend claimed that the dessert, the horchata bread pudding, was the best dessert she'd ever seen/eaten--this from a real dessert maven.  Beautifully presented, it was almost more than two of us could manage, even with taking home two-lunches-worth of our entrees.  Attractive and cosy, and we enjoyed watching the servers work--they're a really professional team.  I look forward to returning soon.",

    "text": "What's not to like?? This place is absolutely awesome and is quickly becoming one of Phoenix's not-so-best kept secrets. I tell everybody about this place. It may be a bit difficult to find for the first time - it's is in a very non-descript area of town, off the beaten path with no street visibility (except when they put their A-frame sign out.) The food is consistently delicious.Both the Asado and White Prawns were cooked to perfection. The sides of chiliglazed carrots, green chile cornbread casserole, chipotle mashed potatoes and creamed corn are also incredibly tasty - and just the right portion size. As much as we love this place, we hadn't been in quite a while so were pleasantly surprised that they have expanded. We sat outside because the weather was terrific, but it is great to know that there are now more tables available for when our weather es caliente!",

You might want to make a reservation if you want to sit inside.   They have a pretty big drink selection and the menu has a little bit of everything. I ordered the signature pernil asado which is pulled pork with a orange habanero mojo sauce and got the chili glazed carrots and cornbread casserole for sides.   The dish was prettty basic, it was just pulled pork with a side of the orange habanero mojo. The pork itself was pretty good, nothing spectacular, it was the sauce that really made the dish. The dish was tasty but I dont think it was worth $19 though.  Overall Fuego bistro is a great restaurant with creative latin american  dishes and would recommend this place to other foodies.",

When the weather is cooler, it's a perfect patio for happy hour.  Dinner gets a little pricier, but not any less worthy of praise.    For drinks, their maragarita is a smooth, fairly strong tasting wonder.  The wife prefers the blood orange/peach mojito (also quite tasty).  Think most happy hour drinks are $6-9.    As for food, you will *not* go wrong with anything pernil.  Their pernil (slow roasted pork) is fantastic.  At happy hour, get the pernil nachos - we get at least 1 order everytime we go and sometimes more if we have a few other people with us.  Fish tacos were quite tasty if that's your bag.  Shrimp and lightly friend and tasty.  I can honestly say I've never tried anything here I didn't enjoy.  Sure, some things I love more than others, but there isn't a disappointment on the menu so far.  Cannot recommend this place enough for happy hour.  Great service as well.",

    "text": "I came here with a Groupon we had. It had great reviews from what we saw, so we decided to try it.  It was a little tricky to find and to figure out where to park but nothing that was overly hard.   It was much smaller then I expected. Definate hole in the wall I would have never had noticed it not for Groupon.  It's in an aging building that gives it a nice bistro look.  There are tables to sit outside in the courtyard. The inside had only a handful of tables and I felt very cramped.   So since we are on the subject of apperance..... For the price of the food they really need to clean up this place.  When your going to pay $25 for a meal I expect the place to be clean and up to date.  The menu's are old and the lamination is coming apart and yellowing.  The ground was dirty not just from foot traffic but from not proper cleaning in years. The corners and where the wall meets the floor was disgusting! Major gunk! They really need to do a good scrubbing or at the minium mop everyday.  The place is small so there shouldn't be that much of a burden to clean it.  Cobwebs in the upper corner of the dining area was not a pretty site and the windows are dirty.  I am not one to look for these types of things so when the jump out at me I am shocked.   The food was good but not what I would pay that high price for again. I ordered the Rare Blackend Ahi Tuna.  The flavor was good and I did enjoy all the food we ordered.   Waiters and owner are very nice and welcoming.  There are no high chairs so this is not a kid friendly place which is fine I don't think all places need to be and yes I am a mother. We brought along our baby which sat in our lap and we were fine.    If this place had been clean I would give it 4 stars but I just can't get over all the grime on the floor and the yellowing menu's.",

The special menu was 33/pp, came with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd course AND a glass of Sangria. When I heard free sangria I automatically thought it would be some watered down, sugary mess but it was delicious! And we even got to pick between 4 different types. I think we all got the \"remix\" one which was blackberry. For the first course we got the empenadas, green chili cornbread, and giant prawns. The cornbread was the favorite I think...it was sooo good, and not just a little slice of bread, it comes in a bowl and is HUGE. For dinner we had the signature pernil asado, chicken breast, and I think it was short rib enchiladas. Each entree came with a choice of TWO sides! Seriously....so much food but it was all soooo good..of course we all got the cheddar/chiptole mashed potatoes that were super spicy but delicious. Key Lime pie won the dessert round for sure. Service was great! Timing between courses was a little quick (overlapped between 1 & 2) but we tried to pace ourselves. Our server was really great in offering his opinions and answering every question. There was also a lot of team work going on which is good to see. All in all this place was AWESOME.  We got THREE meals out of our one (totally sounds like my grandma wrapping her thanksgiving leftovers in foil, but it's True) We will definitely be back, with or without restaurant week.",

I sat at the bar and had a mango mojito and the special, a delicious seafood enchilada with scallops and crab.   Food aside, this place has a 5-star vibe.

Service: waitstaff and the service in general seemed a little unorganized possibly due to the large party that came in as we finished up. Once they round to us the host, dressed in shorts and an oversized button down, made it right and extended the social hour for our whole stay. They do a good job just don't have high standards/expectations.   Food: empanadas, chicken tacos and tostadas. The two chicken dishes looked a like but it seemed like the tostadas were spicier and with smokiness, maybe chipotle. Anyway the apps were delicious and filling.   Drink: spicy margarita, Moscow mule, and NOT YOUR MOTHERS margarita. I cap the latter because it was awesome. Don't be fooled by the Amber color from the agave nectar this is a solid refreshing libation. Spicy margarita had a spicy sugar rim and the mule came in a copper mug.

The misters on the patio were great and it was actually comfortable enough to sit outside. Pashley, our waitress, was fantastic. I ordered the salmon special and my husband the enchiladas, both amazing. But I think the corn was the my favorite! The drink menu looked awesome, but as I am pregnant I couldn't try any of them :) the bartender made some muddled delicious drink to accommodate me and growing baby and I was in heaven. The live music was outstanding! We talked to a couple other diners who are regulars there and said that the music continually rotates but is always great. We will definitely be back!!",

We started with cocktails - I highly recommend the Sangria - it was wonderful!  They had an extensive wine list that we also both enjoyed.  We started with Tapas - the crab cakes and empanadas.  I am not a huge crab fan, but the crab cakes were to die for!  There was a mild pesto sauce that the crab cake sat in and a chutney for dipping.  It really pulled all the flavors out.  The empanadas were spicey and tangy enveloped in a fresh, flakey pastry that was excellent.  For entrees my husband had the steak, which he loved and I had the pork.  Although it was a bit fatty it was really flavorful.  We both had the chipotle cheddar potatoes and creamed corn which were out of this world! We ended the evening sharing the chocolate torte, which although rich was decadent and the tres leche cake which might be the best I've ever had.  Overall the evening was excellent, the service wonderful and it was a romantic evening.",

With that being said, the food is delish! Yum! DId I say yum? I had the short ribs, the cheddar chipotle mashed potatoes, and the green chili cornbread casserole. All very good, with a generous portion size. My friends each had their special, which was very good, even though I can't remember what it was! The mojitos...ok, but not worth the $9.00 price in my opinion. I had the pineapple one, and I really didn't taste any pineapple. My friend had the black cherry, and again, it was ok. The staff was very friendly, and the service was good. I will return, but maybe for lunch or happy hour, when not quite as expensive. And one more thing. If you have a bratty kid, who ignores you when you ask him repeatedly what he wants for dinner, leave him at home! Ugh!",

Fuego have the best mojitos in town.. PERIOD.. try the pomegranite or the passion fruit... they will blow you away... I eat here a couple of times a month.. The pasta, scallops, pernil, and the Ropa are insane good.... Not many places also give you great supporting cast of sides as well... At lunch the chile relleno is fantastic, and I think the coconut shrimp, and empenadas are stellar appetizers..(Trader Joes bag aside?) I think they hit all 3... Atmosphere, service, and the food are worthy of an incredible night out..",

I was lucky to get in at all, since I went on NYE, but my excitement was dampened by waiting at the bar over ten minutes before anyone took a drink order.  (Hence the missing star.)  When the bartender realized that, though, he promptly apologized and took both drink and food orders ASAP.  The prickly pear mojito was amazing, and the bartender was personable and helpful to everyone.  The dinner menu was kind of pricy, but the food was very good.  I had the tilapia and the chipotle mashed potatoes, and I thought they were both amazing.  The portion size was big enough to make for a comfortable dinner and leftover lunch the next day (except the potatoes, which predictably never left the restaurant!).  I also had the jalapeno cornbread casserole -- to me, it was okay but less impressive than the mashed potatoes.  The wait staff and hostess were all very attentive (other than the minor glitch at the beginning), which made up for sitting right next to the credit card machine.  I'll definitely be going back (albeit either for the happy hour menu or a coupon!).  Good food, pleasant people and great drinks!",

Perhaps it was the incoming storm bringing along humidity - or perhaps it was that the tiny place had the thermostat set at 84 with the sun beating in the window - regardless no one seemed concerned except the diners.    The food was very good - the dinner selections were over $20+ but quite large ($5 charge for plate splitting) however there were only about 7 options.   Lunch menu sounded good - and had more choices, but isn't available after 3 (or 4).     We started with the pork nachos & empanadas.  Nachos were filling - but well - they were nachos.  The empanadas were savory, slightly spicy and fresh tasting, flaky and had a delish sauce.  Personally I settled for appetizers - Cubano pork sliders and a side of carrots.   Sliders were good, the pulled pork nicely seasoned and accented with their purple slaw.  Chile Maple Carrots were lacking any maple and left your mouth a little tingly from the heat.  I also had a mojito - which is one of their specials but wasn't anything to write home about.    My hubby had the Pasta de Fuego -  huge portion, lots of veggies, chicken and sausage in a tasty spiced cream sauce.   He got an extra side of the chipolte cheddar mashed - those were my favorite thing there.    Our companions split the seafood chile relleno.  They enjoyed it - I didn't try (scallops are not my friend).  They had the jalapeno cornbread as a side - it was good, full of corn, crusty outside, moist middle and bits of bacon.   They also had a sangria - which mostly tasted like wine with an orange slice floating in it (yeah - I know, what is sangria if not wine with fruit floating in it  - but it can be much more).    We would have stayed for desert as we were celebrating a birthday - but it was too hot.  Believe me - if I'm too hot to eat cake it's pretty darn warm.    We did have a groupon - but it didn't get talked about till we were ready for the bill, so there was no disparaging service.   The waiter did seem quite pretentious - perhaps he just treats everyone like they don't quite deserve to eat there.",

We shared the empanadas and I had the chicken tortilla soup. My mom had the Jumbo Sauteed Prawns and they looked good. Dinner wasn't cheap so it was nice we had the giftcard.

The outdoor patio is cute and there was a live jazz band when we visited on a Saturday evening. I had:  - Vegetarian Tostadas: Yum! The guacamole and chipotle aioli was quite delicious and nicely balanced the sweet cabbage - 12 Vegetable Enchiladas: Amazing! These have to be the best vegetarian enchiladas I've ever had - real vegetables with a lot of flavor instead of just cheese. - Bread Pudding: This was the only average food item we had all night. I just didn't love the combination of fruit and chocolate and cinnamon - personal flavor preference. - Jalapeno Creamed Corn: Oh my gosh delicious. Sweet & hot at the same time - I highly recommend this side dish. - Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes: Also really great - full of flavor and very satisfying.  The service we received while at Fuego Bistro was excellent. Our server was great and provided prompt service without being intrusive. She was also very observant - I ordered a vegetarian appetizer & entree, and had selected vegetarian-sounding sides that actually were not. She asked if I was vegetarian and let me know that the sides I had selected actually contained bacon. Now that's great service!",

There is truly something for everyone, beer and wine to boot. The prickly-pear margarita was by far the BEST margarita I've ever had - thanks for that! Food - wow. They have a marvelously affordable social hour from 3-6pm with terrific choices. We shared the epenadas, the paella, and the cornbread smothered with chicken, resting on black beans. The short rib enchiladas were the hit of the table, but the pork pernil wasn't too shabby either. The seafood enchilada was a bit overdone, but that may be a personal choice. Loved the sides - gorgeously vibrant maple spicy carrots, fresh green beans, cheddary mashed potatoes, and that glorious cornbread. Don't miss it... or the chocolate chip bread pudding with malted crunch ice cream. Not sure how often their menu changes, but skip on over and give them a try. You will not be disappointed.",

Since most of the dish was spicy it was served with a side of candied cabbage. I've never had that before... It was quite interesting and a fun contrast to the spiciness of everything else.   I ordered the dragonberry mojito. They have awards for their mojito's so I was expecting a lot. It was good but I would have preferred a little less mint and a little more dragonberry.

    "text": "Fuego Bistro: This is what a bistro should be.   Had it not been for a great deal on Groupon, I don't know if Robert M and I would have made it for dinner here. It's not that we hadn't thought about it, it's just that it's oddly located. But that's neither here nor there, because last night we dined--and we dined well.   We started our date with sangria--Robert the white and I the red. Initially I thought I'd erred in my decision (the white was fruity and intense while the first taste of the red was merely okay). But then the complexity of the red unfolded, as spices piqued out and enveloped the glass. Either way, both are exceptional.   Our first course was the empenadas. In a word: Magnificent! The perfectly flaky crust and the robust filling could be an entire meal of its own. I, however, would do away with the hot sauce served on the side. Just a preference, or if they had a house salsa that would be good.   Main course was the Pollo Ajedrea for Robert and the daily special (chile rellenos stuffed with scallops, shrimp and tilapia) for me. Sides were chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes for both of us and black beans for Rob and green beans for myself. After sampling our own entrees, we tried each other's. To be honest, after being blown away by my dish, the chicken was a bit flat, and that by no means indicates it wasn't very good. It's just that I was so amazed by the chile rellenos. It was one of the things of which I dreamt last night. Those mashed potatoes were another thing dancing through my head. :dreamy eyes:   It's located in a ballet studio complex, which is enchanting. There is also a lovely patio which some braved the cold last night on which to dine and be entertained by a local musician. Once the weather becomes more tolerable, I'll give it a go.   Service was fantastic! Susan was genuinely friendly, as if we were regulars, and cemented the deal that we would be back again and again.   Fuego Bistro has an incredible happy hour, from what I understand, that runs from 3-6 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. Yes, boys and girls, I said Saturday. They have about two dozen items from their menu for $5 (including those empenadas) and assorted cocktails. This could turn in to a sordid love affair, if I don't mind myself.",

After a whole day of driving around the Valley, it was so relaxing to go into the beautiful patio and indulge in made-from-scratch sangria. Our host and our server, who were a pleasure to talk to, guided us through the happy hour menu and we decided to have the ropa sliders, followed by the pernil asado sliders - both excellent.  We capped off the evening with the creamy decadence of their banana burrito, then headed out into the cool January night warmed by our pleasurable experience at this charming place.",

    "text": "Perfect for a quiet birthday dinner, or a date night. This low-key place, without fancy decor or furniture, has room for 25-odd diners. What it lacks in terms of the set-up, it makes up with the food and the attentive service. I think we got served by four different people! We got two white sangrias, a tortilla soup and  jumbo sauteed prawns in a tomatillo avocado sauce and a chipotle guajillo sauce with mango fruit chutney, for appetizers.   The tortilla soup was served in a deeeeeep bottomed bowl, and was hot and delicious. I would have been happy making a dinner out of the soup, with some garlic bread thrown in, but since it was a special dinner, I couldn't linger over the soup and finish it all up...I had to leave space for the main course. The prawns were not jumbo, but they were delicious nonetheless.   For main course we got the day's special, which was a  medley of all their seafood: mussels, ahi tuna, prawns--on a bed of deliciously soft spinach and rice, and their famous Pernil Asado. The pork was soft, juicy and flavorful.   We had no room for desserts...though I would have loved to try the Kahlua Creme brulee. Well, I'll save that for next time, I guess!",

We enjoyed some of the small plates - have to say the enpanadas were awesome! But the so-called amazing drinks we kept hearing about, definitely didn't find those. My husband's mojito looked and tasted like it had been sitting on the bar counter waiting for someone to order it. My sangria tasted a little better than something you would buy at the store in a pre-made mix.  Not saying we won't go back, like I said the food was great, but we definitely won't be spending $13 on a drink, probably stick to wine and beer.",

    "text": "Really enjoyed Fuego Bistro for date night. The ambiance was charming and the server was friendly, knowledgeable and unobtrusive. My husband and I wanted to sample a bit of everything and had heard the entree portions were huge (literally every customer was going home with part of their dinner boxed up), so we split an appetizer, an entree and dessert. It was perfect and I left feeling satisfied but not overly stuffed.  I ordered the pomegranate mojito (virgin because I'm pregnant) and it was so refreshing, not too sweet - perfect summer drink. Can't wait to go back and try it with rum! We started with the vegetarian tostadas, which I would definitely recommend; the vegetables were really fresh on the crispy tostada and there was just enough kick from the pico de gallo and chipotle sauce.  For our entree, we shared a stuffed chicken dish with cream sauce that was the special that night (the husband loves ordering specials). Chicken was cooked perfectly and I really liked the sauce which managed to be creamy but not too rich. We chose the cornbread and creamed corn for our sides. The cornbread was yummy - light, fluffy, a little spicy - but I would past on the creamed corn next time. Too sweet and nothing special.   Finally, we split the key lime pie for dessert. We were deciding between that and the bread pudding, which sounded a bit too heavy for the 100+ degree heat outside, so we opted for the pie based on our server's recommendation. It was awesome! Smooth and slightly tangy with a crunchy chocolate crust, served with whipped cream, chocolate sauce and nuts. Definitely worth splitting an entree so you have room for dessert.  I will return to Fuego Bistro, it's a small menu but there are several dishes I would try. Our server didn't up-charge us a split plate fee for the entree which was nice, because the prices are a little steep. I also plan to check out their Happy Hour which looks like a great value...once I can finally drink again!",

What a disappointment!  I had thought it would be filled with mostly cheese but it wasn't.  I did not like the filling or the crunchy skin.  Also it was too hot and spicey.  next time I will stick to my pork tacos.  Hopefully they will be the same as at their other restaurant.  I also do not like their salsa.  It is not chunky and is TOO HOT.  Now if they served their pico de gallo to those who do not like the spicey salsa and without charging 3 bucks,  I mean like if you are serving salsa then at least besides HOT, serve some medium, and some mild.",

Slowly after a couple minutes, I saw a ballet place and a quaint courtyard leading to the restaurant.  When we walked towards the courtyard, it looked much better.  They have outside seating and some inside seating.  We chose the outside because they had some live music going on.  All the items looked very interesting.  I went for the Restaurant Week choice of Chicken Tortilla Soup, Vegetarian Enchiladas, and Banana Burrito sundae.  The vegetables in the enchilada tasted a lot better than I expected.  My friends shared beef empanadas and chicken chipotle pasta.  The flavors were very vibrant and rich.  Everything tasted exceptional.  This place is family owned and the two chefs are from Guadalajara, Mexico.  This Hole in the Wall is a place I will have to visit again for Happy Hour.",

It's apparently hard to find if you don't have a GPS, but most people do these days so no sweat.  The food was AWESOME!!!! It was some of the best food I've had in a long time. Everything was perfect and very filling. I ordered the carnitas tacos with rice and beans. The carnitas were slow cooked for a few days with various spices. OMFG, yes please. The rice and beans, generally a side that are NBD, were soooo yummy. I could eat that combo everyday. Seriously. That sauce on the tacos was delish too.  The rest of the trip I talked about how good the food was and how I wanted to go back. Sadly it was too far from my Mom's place. Next time it's on!!  I'd also like to casually mention that Yelp may or may not still have a $5 for $10 deal for it. Even better!",

Each item we had was so unique and beyond regular fare taste that our taste buds were at attention!  Food: We ordered Empanadas which had a tender crusty outside and a tasty center which included ground beef, cheddar cheese, black bean, corn, peppers, onions, and roasted Anaheim chilis served with a homemade chipotle BBQ sauce which was a spicy sweet taste. Yum! We both ordered the Pernil Asado which is pork roasted until it's so tender and very juicy that it falls apart. No knife required. 2 homemade tortillas and an orange habanero mojo sauce are included. The mojo sauce is so tasty we used every last drop. The entrees come with 2 sides so we tried 1. Green Chili Cornbread Casserole which is so moist and the best corn bread I've ever had. 2. Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes which have a smoky unique flavor.   One thing I can say is bring your appetite because there's lots of food. This is a real comfort meal!",

    "text": "We have no shortage of Mexican Food joints in the Phoenix area. Some would say we maybe have too many. However, as an avid Mexican Food fan, I can't ever have enough. I will say, though, that some tend to be the same old story, with slight tweaks. Example? The burrito at Garcia's tastes a lot like the one at Manuel's. Don't even get me started on Macayo's...  However, Fuego Bistro is that breath of fresh air that we Mexican Food lovers have been waiting for. Everything is fresh, unique, and absolutely fantastic. The first time I came here, I tried the pernil asada, a tender, shredded pork dish that beats any carnitas-style dish I've ever had. The crisp, sweet red cabbage that they serve with it and other dishes is so amazing that even I eat it, and I typically hate cabbage.   Then there's the happy hour. Cheap prices on wonderful food, to include the Cubano Sliders. Oh my goodness, were these something to die for. They go quite well with a cold Modelo with lime too, by the way.  Prices run a bit high, but the lunch menu offers a bit of a break, and happy hour of course is very reasonable. In all, you won't be disappointed here. If anything, you'll be thankful for a fresh take on a cuisine that has become rather saturated into the Phoenix area. My kudos to the chef, staff, and owner of this fine dining establishment.",

My favorites are the empanadas,  the chicken with the tomatillo cream sauce and the Fuego pasta. My favorite sides are the green chili cornbread casserole and the chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes.  Just talking about it makes me want to eat there. The space they occupy is near a dance studio so it's fun to see students running around.  The outdoor dining space is gorgeous when the weather is nice and they have live music some nights. The iced tea is a must and I have tried the Kahlua Creme Brulee with friends but I didn't love it because I don't love Kahlua but if you do then it'll be amazing!  You can't go wrong with this place. Casual enough to bring family and friends but the food and atmosphere are lovely enough to bring a date or to impress your boss or clients. The portions are huge which is great because then you get to enjoy your meal all over again the next day! Lastly, the service here is top notch!  I'm pretty sure the owner goes around refilling drinks and bringing out food! Oops almost forgot, for those with kids there is a kids menu for 12 and under who need more familiar foods like chicken fingers, tacos or cheese quesadilla etc.",

Interesting artwork is available for purchase on the walls.  We were promptly and courteously seated, but I did notice that when I had called earlier to make the reservation, I had been asked if we preferred outside or inside seating.  I chose outside, and we were promptly seated inside!  This was no big deal, and we were offered a table outside if we wanted.  Our waitress was friendly and efficient, and the food was excellent, with huge portions.  Make sure to save room for dessert!  The only hiccup was really not the restaurant's fault - their internet was down so they couldn't use the credit card terminal machine.  This created a bit of confusion and significantly slowed down paying the bill.  Despite the fiasco, our server remained calm and polite, even though she was not particularly thrilled about us splitting the bill.  In summary, I do recommend giving this place a good look and enjoy a mojito while you're there!",

    "text": "Spinach salad with bacon citrus vinaigrette dressing, goat cheese, red onion and house caramelized nuts @ afternoon happy hour prices.  Cool spot to cool your heels on a hot afternoon on the shaded, mist-cooled patio or the small-but-not cramped wonderfully cool dining room and bar.  This is a really relaxing oasis of calm down to the Ottmar Leibert (spelling?)  Latin jazz in the background, quiet enough so you hold a conversation without having to raise your voice.    A thoroughly inviting a place to sit, have a cool drink of your choice and add something with some heat from the kitchen perhaps more because you are in no hurry than due to hunger.  For the delicate gringo stomached among us, note that Fuego does mean \"Fire\", and there is a little - or more in nearly every dish I've tried.  None have been overwhelming but some did incite some internal conversation over self-induced gastric distress. For those similarly afflicted, a pink bismuth aqueous solution shooter may be the perfect preparatory aperitif.  It's worth it.    A surprisingly delightful, sophisticated find tucked behind Apollo's on 7th Street in a commercial area of 7th Street not otherwise particularly aesthetically appealing.  I was already a fan of Fuego Cityscape and this Fuego is all that and more.  More  upscale in offerings and prices as well, but watch for the frequent Groupon or similar offers online.  Maybe it was the hot day, the iced tea, and the cool, relaxed comfort of the dining room (not to forget the attentive service), but all in all on this day, this was bliss. 5 Stars.",

Tremendous depth and complexity of flavors. Dishes that compliment each other without ever getting over-whelmed.  A festive atmosphere with live music in the background.... Wow!!!  We had been to The Mission 2 days earlier which everyone raves about.  That was good this was GREAT!!!     Next time we are in town we will be back!",

The food is perfected and is a mouthful of flavor no matter what you get. My favorites are the chipotle mashed potatoes and the jalapeno corn bread paired with the ancho chile rubbed steak. In the evening time they have live music that adds a romantic touch with tables that are candle lit. The staff are very attentive and always make sure your having the best dining experience possible. The only shock is for two people without any coupons the bill will easily be about $100. It's well worth it!",

I'm kind of sad that our experience was not all that great this time.   The waiter that we had was not very good.  Was not very helper and he never came around to see if we liked our food or if we needed anything.    Also the water guy was great, he came around and checked on us, to see if we liked our food or if we needed anything.  I wish we could have tipped him and not our waiter.   Now for the food, it was pretty good.  We ordered the Pineapple short rib roast and it came with mashed potatoes and creamy corn.   It is definitely an enough for two people.      Last and not least, the atmosphere of this restaurant is not all that great either.  It is in the middle of this little shopping center and you could hear the music for the dance studio that was right next to the patio seating.   Happy yelping everyone!!!  If you decided to come here the food is not all that bad.  We in joyed it!!!",

I had the Bistro Seafood Chile Relleno with the cornbread and tortilla soup. The entree and the cornbread were perfect in every way! The outdoor seating was cooled by multiple misters.  Two musicians performed for the patrons and that was fun! Our server was attentive and helpful with the menu. A \"Perfect 10\" for dinner! Can't wait to try out the lunch and happy hour menu!   If you like unique local restaurants who deliver quality menu items and friendly service, then head down to Fuego Bistro!   On a side note, dinner entrees are in the $23-$28 range.  I asked if you can order off the lunch menu and was told that was not an option. Although we didn't have lunch or happy hour there, I can attest there are plenty of less pricey items to chose from on those menus.",

Server called owner about HER mistake when providing the infomation to me to which all the owner had to say was \"MAKE SURE HE PAYS\".

    "text": "We went here for dinner and it just so happened to be restaurant week... lucky us! Usually restaurant week isn't my favorite because your service isn't as great or you get smaller portions, but that wasn't the case here (I hadn't dined here before but I will say that if these weren't full size portions then the portions must be HUGE). Live music (on Friday nights at least - and I would assume all weekend), so many gluten free options, great food, great service... awesome!   Food: We (very much) enjoyed the Guacamole, Chips & Salsa small plate... the salsa is a chipotle salsa with a little kick.. yum! We also got to try a sampler platter of small plates, which came with an Empanada, Spicy Veggie Tostada and Cubano Slider... unfortunately for me I could only enjoy the tostada (only GF item of the three) but it was seriously delicious! Definitely hard to share... but nonetheless, delicious. My aunt and cousin did say that the other items were just as good, especially the empanada! I tried a bite of the Tortilla soup (5/5 stars) and had the Spinach Salad - seriously, SO good... their balsamic dressing was one of my favorites I've had. For my main meal, I had the Ropa Vieja (it didn't look like it was on the regular menu) but it was so good. Such great flavor, wonderfully tender and more than I could eat so definitely enough for leftovers); for my sides I had the Jalapeno Cream Corn and Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes -- both highly recommended... unique, great flavors. For dessert, the Chocolate Torte isn't technically GF because the pan it is made in is lined with flour... I went for it (only eating a bite) and tried to not eat the outsides because none of the actual ingredients contain wheat/gluten... it was very rich and I only had a bite because I was so full.  Drinks: With the restaurant week menu came a glass of their sangria. Honestly, not a fan... tasted semi-watered down. I wish I had tried the Mojito as I had originally planned. It was kind of a let down so I wouldn't order it if (I mean when) I return... my cousin also agreed that this wasn't our favorite.   Service: So great and tentative. The (I think) manager was very friendly and checked on us multiple times throughout our meal. Our waitress was super awesome and friendly! Just as good as the meal itself.   In conclusion, I will definitely be back! The ONLY thing I didn't enjoy 100% was the sangria, as mentioned. But I am picky with my drinks and I'm sure next time whatever drink I have will be amazing. The outside seating may get a little warm in the summer months but they do have misters (they weren't on when we were there because it wasn't too warm). The live music really set a great ambiance. We were right next to the band and it wasn't too loud but it's also loud enough to be heard all over the patio. I definitely think this is one of my new favorites.",

He scoffed at us and said \"wish I could take your dough, but we cannot take anyone - not even at the bar.\"  Really didn't care if they were going to be able to seat us or not, but treating us a little bit better when breaking the news would have been appreciated.

My wife and I came for lunch on a Saturday. What first caught our attention was the lack of any real formal entrance. You kind of just find yourself in a courtyard with tables. Lunch is less formal so we just found a seat and the lone server (that's right, there was only one on shift), took our order. The courtyard wasn't the nicest looking, but it definitely felt warm and cozy.  We got the lunch feast, which was basically a sampler of all their popular dishes. Not only did we thoroughly enjoy it, we also felt the price was more than reasonable. We got appetizers, main courses, and two desserts.  Everything tasted good, with some dishes better than others. In my opinion, the Pernil Asado and their empanadas were the best, while my wife really enjoyed the Cuban sliders and veggie tostadas. We had their chocolate torte and bread pudding for dessert. The bread pudding was good, but their chocolate torte was amazing.   The reason I would lower the score by a half point if possible would be due to the slow service. It had nothing to do with our server, who was friendly and helpful, but rather due to the fact that she was waiting on about a dozen tables at once. Getting our bill and paying took a little longer than desired.   Overall, I highly recommend trying this place out, especially for lunch.",

Once you get there it is not as bad, but it is tiny and it feels kind of crowded. The menu is very creative, but the dinner prices are a tad to high for a small place like this in this location. You can easily go over a hundred (including tip) for a dinner for 2 (no alcohol, yes to dessert) We had the Fuego pasta and the Angus short ribs. The short ribs with a side of jalapeno cornbread (these guys bring cornbread to a whole new level) and chipotle mashed potatoes.  I thought they were really good, I was not so crazy about the pasta but my hubby liked it.  We shared a Kahula Creme Brulee $9 (Big typo in the menu, I believe it was Kahlua), it was so so, I did not love it. No Kahlua on my creme brulee next time : )  Service was great. We may be back, if we are even in that neighborhood : )",

    "text": "Amazing.  Micdrop.  From someone who is in the industry and is extremely particular about what I put in my body this place did not disappoint, and in fact, impressed.  I primarily eat fish and I had the kabobs with shrimp and ahi.  Ahi has to be perfectly cooked to temperature and the chef did this.  This was my \"cheat meal\" as far as nutrition and it was well worth it.  The cornbread had bacon (but large pieces so I could avoid it), the chipotle mashed potatoes were Fuego (no pun intended), and the creamed corn was off the chain.  To be honest this food was just overall amazing and everyone in my party agreed.  I don't know if you can call me a foodie but again I am super particular and have worked in many places that take great pride in their product and Fuego Bistro I see you!  Jesus our server was right on point and super patient with us and our needs!  Right on bro!  Thanks to all the staff- I can't wait to see you again.  You made my night off amazing!",

I like how it's off the beaten path and you kind of have to know where you're going. It has a super cute patio area where they play live music EVERY NIGHT. The inside is a little smaller but super cozy, and my parents love Missy (the bartender) but our waitress and the others working were all nice.  I got the Pernil Asada with tortilla soup and the fuego salad. My parents ordered the tilapia that was lightly crusted with an amazing sauce. They also got the black beans and the cheesy mashed potatoes. I have to say, every thing I had was delish.  I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "There are many reasons why I love this restaurant, so I'll share with you my \"Top 5 Reasons You Should Dine At Fuego\".  5. The place is f*cking charming as a mo-fo. If you want a romantic setting for date night, sit in the art gallery near the piano. If you want to dance after dark, sit outside on the hacienda style patio under the misters and shake your hips to the live band. If you want to get schwasted via craft cocktails, sit inside near the bar so your drinks won't have far to travel, thus arriving in your hand quicker from round to round.   4. It is locally-owned and operated by a staff that really knows how to make you feel welcome and appreciated. I've been here at least a half dozen times, over the course of the past 5 years, and see some of the same smiling staff members in the dining room and in the kitchen during that period of time. Everyone is gracious, everyone is pleasant, everyone is accommodating.  3. The crowd is a swath of humanity. Old folks, young folks, families with little kids, couples on date night, girlfriends meeting up to share a bottle of wine- there's a little bit of everyone dining and drinking at Fuego. You can't help but feel comfortable.   2. Latin-inspired food that looks and tastes like it's made from scratch. This is not a Mexican restaurant, even though some of the dishes are Mexican-inspired and feature common ingredients from that cuisine, so don't get it twisted. Empanadas, quesadillas, enchiladas, rellenos, TACOS (but tacos are only for lunch or happy hour). All excellent and anything including pernil will set you up for happiness. Get the cornbread as a side and perpare to make an \"oh damn\" face as you bite into it. You ever go to a restaurant and ignore the server schpiel about the specials? Don't ever do that here. Listen and take notes because you'll probably want to order one. Unless you are a vegan or a vegetarian because the specials always seem to star a meat of some sort. Also of note- the servers always tell you the price of the specials. I can't stand it when that important info is missing but it's always included at Fuego. My favorite steak besides the steaks coming off of my grill at home are served here. Don't pass up the ribeye!  1. Happy Hour. It's called Social Hour at Fuego and it offers discounts on drinks and appetizers that are hard to beat. You could show up with a few friends and do a tapas style dinner for not a lot of ca$h with $4 beers or $6 wine glasses. That would also afford you a chance to try a lot of the food to see what you might want to go steady with as an entree sometime.   It's not the cheapest restaurant (dinner entrees are all $25-$30 give or take a buck) but you'll enjoy every bite of your meal and you'll have impeccable service and probably have leftovers. With a few new drinking and dining establishments opening nearby, I imagine Fuego will only get busier.",

We didn't make any reservations so we were unable to get a table outside, where live musicians were strumming and singing on their guitars with a lovely fountain in the middle of the plaza. But lucky for us, we got the next best thing and were seated in the adjacent art gallery. We didn't mind at all, because our spontaneous dinner decision became a blessing in disguise, we had THE ENTIRE ROOM to ourselves! When we looked at the menu, the amount of delicious entrees overwhelmed me. But at the very bottom was something awesomely titled \"The feast\"  which could be ordered for two-six people. The only description on the menu was \"Ask server\". The mystery baited us, and our lovely waitress Pashley described it as a three course meal that had all the best items the restaurant had to offer. The only catch was that unfortunately we would not be able to apply any of our deals towards our order. We looked at each other, it was a special occasion after all...and so in the name of food adventure and love we said, \"Screw it, let's do it!\" Our waitress couldn't help but share our excitement and already pre-congratulated us on our decision. \"It's A LOT of food,\" she said mischievously. And so our journey into our 3-course Latin meal began... Course 1: An assortment of appetizers that included a perfectly stuffed and cooked beef empanada, a cuban pork slider, a chicken taco, and a full salad. We basically tasted every animal you could in every type of Latin flavor you could muster, and I am oversimplifying the amount ingredients in this first plate. What can I say except de-li-cious! Perfect way to set the tone! Course 2: Entrees galore! Shredded pork, fish that had been cooked and prepared for over a week drizzled in sauce, sweet jalapeno corn, green beans, corn bread with corn bits in them, pink pickled cabbage. So Good, just so good! Course 3: Dessert! Death by chocolate anyone? We had two plates, one with a fudge torte and ice cream on top with walnuts, the ancho chile chocolate, and another with a gelatinous dessert with caramels and fudge covering it topped off with dollops of whipped cream, the fuego sundae. (Yeah, out of all the dishes, I unashamedly finished this entire plate.) We tried, oh my gosh we tried, to finish everything, and we still went home with two boxes of leftovers and stuffed to the brim. I ate those leftovers for two days afterwards! Was it worth it? Hell yes it was!  On a personal note, we were celebrating our one year anniversary, and the staff, from the jolly maitre de to our lovely waitress Pashley, was so sweet and warm that it made the whole night spectacular. Coupled with the live guitarist, delectable courses, and private room, I'd say this was a win-win-win!",

Wanted to try a whole bunch of food from the happy hour menu but for some reason she gave us  the dinner plates. She didn't warn us that it might be too much food. She even recommended what else to get. The two good things that make it worth one star at least was the cornbread and vegetable tostado.  The waitress was in her own little world thinking we were loving all the food we weren't eating nor drinking.  I was expecting to be wasting $35 or so but due to the dinner plates it ended up being over $100.",

As we were in route to this restaurant we were talking about all the cookie cutter Mexican restaurants with the chips and dip upon entering and hoping this was not one of those. Fuego Bistro is off of the beaten path and a bit difficult to find.  * We had to use our GPS to find the address.  * We found the parking lot, but there was no hint how or where the restaurant was. * We ended up calling the restaurant to get directions from their parking lot. Once we walked into the restaurant, we found that most of the restaurant is in a garden. The \"roof\" of the garden consisted mainly of vines. Although most of the tables were close together, it did not feel crowded. So far, we are pleasantly surprised. When our server arrived with the menus, she did not have the chips and sauce.  Both my wife and I were delighted with the food. The service was rather slow, but that was fine by us as we were enjoying the atmosphere of the garden with live entertainment. Fuego Bistro is an excellent restaurant, albeit a bit pricey. Our dinner was $85 for two dinners and one dessert. Although they are hard to find, the adventure is worth it. If you are interested in great Mexican food, in a fantastic atmosphere, Fuego Bistro is the restaurant to try.",

Great taste and unbelievably large servings. You can definitely share here or make the most of it as they're almost always on Groupon.   This place is well worth it.",

I got the vegetable enchiladas with a side of cuban black beans and chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes. Great concept for all of these items, however, the flavor was not executed.....at all. Needed salt!! Also of note, if you want to sit inside you'll need to make a reservation, otherwise you'll be outside in the very misty misters. Again, great concept and menu ideas, however, the execution of it leaves plenty of room for improvement.",

(We came for the social hour between 3 to 6 pm). The patio was very open filled with tables. It was really a pleasant scene to behold with the fountain in the middle. At first our waitress was very attentive but after more people arrived her attentiveness waned significantly.  The happy hour menu food was delicious. Peasant paella was delicious with generous portions of protein variety (chicken, fish, sausage, and shrimp) Pernil tacos were pretty good as well (the chipotle mayo took the cake) The drinks were pretty good concept but I had varied feelings on the mixture  Blue Hawaiian needed a little mix but eventually was able to drink it  Guava mojito had no taste of guava The Jamaican Mai tai needed a bit more fruit flavor Dessert was delicious and plated with that  Fuego bistro insignia. Quite the presentation. Highly recommend it. Would return with groups :)",

    "text": "Based on the awesome reviews on Yelp and a Yelp offer of $5 for $10 deal, we decide to give this place a try.  We chose to come at lunch time, because we heard lunch has a better price (Thank you fellow Yelper - Doug D).    The restaurant is small; half of it is bar and the other half holds about 8-10 tables.  We just moved from Salt Lake City, so this much liquor in a small restaurant is surprising to us...a nice surprise, of course.  There's a nice size patio, but no one in the right mind would want to sit outdoor for lunch this time of the year (monsoon season) in Phoenix.  We got here about 5 after noon, the restaurant already started to fill.  We waited about 5 minutes, not because the restaurants are full; because the only waitress is chatting with other customers.  I was annoyed.    We finally sat and the waitress kindly helped me pick out Pernil Asado.  Hubby got a Cubano Sandwich.  Both came out quickly and super delicious.  Honestly, I did not expect the pork to be so juicy and good.  You can tell they pay attentions to food they prepare, when the beans and rice are so tasty.    My belly is happy so I am happy, and I could forget about the wait.  In fact, it might have been more than 5 minutes I waited, but......I forgot it already.  I guess I really don't mind having a nice, friendly, and helpful waitress who might be slower because she is also nice, friendly, and helpful to her other customers.  Hubby and I are planing to come back for dinner sometime soon.  I'm dying to try their sangria.  To be continued......",

It's tossed in a delicious onion vinaigrette that I could just as easily eat alone or inject intravenously. It's served with generous portions of avocado, candied walnuts, and these magical homemade tortilla strips. The tortilla soup sets itself apart from those of other restaurants with its big pieces of chicken breast, chipotle sour cream, and once again, the amazing homemade tortilla strips.  Unfortunately, this soup and salad combo is so awesome that I have not been able to move past it and have ordered it each time I've been to Fuego. Hopefully one day, I'll find the strength to tear myself away from the grips of the salad and soup combo and venture on to new Fuego horizons. Or not ;).",

    "text": "Restaurant Week, 2015, Fuego Bistro strenuously solicited entering patrons to participate in its 3-course, prix fixe dinner with a glass of sangria, for $33.  My party all ordered the \"seasonal,\" blackberry sangria. It was watered-down, containing little alcohol, a single, unripe blackberry, and no complexity of flavor.  The first course arrived, served family-style, and consisting of two empanadas, a salad topped with fried tortilla strips, a single salmon croquette, a single Cuban slider, and two vegetarian tostadas. Before I get to quality, let's address quantity. So the server could hear, I rhetorically asked whether a single diner would get half an empanada and a third of a Cuban. No, no, that diner would get a whole of each. But a party of 3, paying 3 times as much for occupying a single table, gets less...The empanada crust was reminiscent of pop tart crust, that is, flavorless. It was perfectly fried, but was a source of no other satisfaction. The filling was simply unadorned, seasoned, ground beef, and topped with a sweetened pico de gallo. The salad was exactly like the Southwest version at McDonald's, only the latter's packet of dressing is better-tasting. The salmon croquette, with \"wild\" salmon, was either overcooked, causing resemblance to the farm-raised variety, or it was, in fact, the caged variety. Overcooked salmon is like cat food. This croquette had no crust, and had yet another, cloyingly sweet, but one-dimensional sauce on top. The Cuban slider was delicious. It had whole-grain mustard, the pork was quite flavorful, and the bread was pleasantly unique to the classic, flat and crisp approach. The tostada had some good texture, another sweet sauce accompanied, but added nothing. The first course should have been a pile of Cuban sandwiches.  The second course arrived in a sizeable mound, on a giant platter. There were corn-based dishes-a-plenty. There were corn tortillas, chile-infused cornbread casserole, corn tortilla-crusted tilapia, jalapeno creamed corn, penne rigate with chicken, green beans sauteed with sliced almonds, and cheddar mashed potatoes. Oh, where to begin? Described as a \"Latin feast,\" the pasta was Italian, tilapia is a fresh water fish from Africa, green beans cooked in the style of France or central Kansas, and mashed potatoes also from Kansas, blended with a cheese from England. What the hell were those food items doing on this platter? They were cheap ingredients. That's the reason. They could be scooped out of the troughs in the back, precooked, then kept warm, and served overcooked and cafeteria style. The green beans had the yellow tinge, characteristic of canned green beans. It's not that they came from a can. It's that they were cooked to death. The pasta was sickening...so overcooked that the noodles would fall apart on the fork. There was shredded pork, touted to have been cooked for 24 hours. WHY?! It was not smoked, so there is absolutely no reason to braise pork for that long. Even if they cooked it sous vide, in an immersion circulator set at 145 degrees, it would not have taken 24 hours to cook. The cornbread casserole had wonderful flavor, but since it was cooked en-masse, it was desert-dry. The mashed potatoes were orange, but contained no cheddar flavor, and the chipotle chiles (smoked jalapenos, in adobo sauce) provided no heat. Last, and definitely least, the tilapia likely sat next to hundreds of its brethren, in stick form, and the breading quickly became soggy and peeled away from the meat. This all took place before it was served, so the solution was to cover up the mistake with a sauce. Without exaggerating, tilapia is the worst fish I have ever eaten. It's a fresh water, lake fish, which is, in and of itself, unappetizing. It carries a foul flavor that Fuego Bistro was able to preserve. High-end restaurants do not serve tilapia period. Phoenix currently stocks its canals with tilapia to curb algae growth.  For dessert, there were three dishes: an ancho chile, chocolate tort, a chocolate chip bread pudding, and chocolate, malted \"crunch\" ice cream. The tort was actually a brownie, so just call it a brownie. The bread pudding was so tough and so dry, it required too much saliva to reconstitute it to maybe draw out some flavor. The ice cream, by comparison, was pretty good, except they texturized it with something that was once crunchy, but quickly became water-logged. They could have used Clark Griswold's, \"non-nutritive cereal varnish, 'crunch enhancer.'\"  My first visit to Fuego was incredibly satisfying. We had better cared for empanadas, a lobster chile relleno, and a pork enchilada with the best mole sauce I have ever tasted. Fuego Bistro's quality, has since, gone up in flames. Maybe we ordered the wrong things...No! Ignoring that the platters were a sampling of several menu items, it's the restaurant's fault if the patron has a bad meal. It was wrong to serve this swill, to charge that much for it, and straight-faced, stand by it.",

First the positives, greta tucked away location, cozy, had some live music playing which was really nice.  You don't find that often.  Service was amazing, and very attentive.  It was our first time here and we went with a group of four and we had a plan to sample as many things as possible, which is what we did.  For me, the food was not that great (except the cornbread and jalapeno corn sauce).  That was YUMM.  But the new york steeak, for me was not marinated or flavored much, and when I can grill something better at home myself, I can't give a shout out.  The bbq pork sliders I had two bites and left the rest.  Margarita's suprisingly were not ever good either.  I tried to doctor them up, but was not a fan of these either.   That being said, my wife liked the nachos and the chicken, but my other friend Jess didn't care for her fish (which she said was dry).  At any rate, cool place, and like I said, I know people will disagree and tastebuds differ, but I don't see myself making a huge effort to go back anytime soon.  I do give them a shoutout in general as I said its a great place to hang out, but that is as far as I can go.  Have fun, and find your sizzle!

I also had a sangria-rita.  The mussels were overcooked, very tough. The taste wasn't bad but underwhelming. I'd rather go across the street to the Yard for them.  I did like the pasta, it had a good spicy kick, but for some reason I just didn't like the chicken that was in it. The mahi mahi was pretty good, though I think the real highlight was in the cornbread-- unfortunately this became really soggy with the broth on the fish.  The sangria-rita was okay-- a novelty but not a great attempt.  The waiter was fantastic-- timely and welcoming. However, for the price and quality of the food, I won't be back for this one.",

    "text": "I had a groupon to this place so a few friends and decided to check it out.  This place is tucked away in a little courtyard building near some dance studios..great ambiance on the patio and quaint dining area inside.  Service was spot on. First I ordered their house made white Sangria.. Was refreshing and delicious.   I decided to get their signature dish after eyeing some of the other customers getting it. Was a HUGE Panko breaded pasilla pepper stuffed with mahi mahi, shrimp and scallops.. I mean really how can this not be amazing and sure enough it was..but just as amazing was the green chile corn bread and cheddar mashed potatoes sides..OMG.  Servings are huge and you won't leave this place hungry.. 20-28 dollar entrees for dinner but you get what you pay for.  Four of us decided to split the banana burrito topped with ice cream and whipped cream and chocolate.. If I died right there I would have died a happy man.. So definitely check this place out for some good Latin inspired comfort food. The server handed us all cards for a free entree when you buy one so we will be coming back.",

We started with the corn bread appetizer which was amazing. I highly recommend it. Then we had the Short Rib Enchiladas and their Chipotle Cream Pasta. We were in heaven. Don't miss the Corn side and Mashed Potatoes side they were delicious. We couldn't get enough. If you like southwestern cuisine go to Fuego Bistro you will absolutely love it.",

    "text": "3.5 Stars. Came here for restaurant week and everything was pretty good!  Got the Cola and pineapple soy braised short rib with jalapeno creamed corn, Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes, and the taco appetizer. Didn't like the tacos, but I tried my fiance's empanadas and I wished I had ordered that. The shortrib was very tender and flavorful I would totally order this again, as well as the side dishes. My fiance ordered the ribeye, it was yummy was cooked perfectly. Everything was delicious but very heavy and buttery so I could only eat 1/4 of my dish before I got full and a little sick lol. I tried my friends green beans too, very tasty even thought it was just green beans.   We all alternated and got the red and white sangria, both were tasty but the red was definitely stronger. I was really looking forward to the horchata bread pudding and was really disappointed. I was expecting a cinnamon explosion but I couldn't really taste the \"horchata\" in it and it was more of a bread than bread pudding... it was super dense and not very moist. Maybe they were having an off day? I did however try my fiances kahlua creme brulee and it was delicious. Make sure to order this for dessert!  The restaurant itself is kind of in a random residential area, the indoor part is small but the outdoor patio is spacious. We came wiht a big group for restaurant week so we had to sit outside. It's a little awkward though because the restaurant is surrounded by other buildings, including a kid's dance studio. So we had kiddos dancing and watching us while we stuffed our faces...yeah it sort of killed the ambiance. There was a live singer there though so that was nice touch.   I'll probably be back to try more items on the menu, but we will sit inside this time!",

    "text": "This was a great spot found by little sisters boyfriend. He saw it on groupon and did the research on Yelp and we ended up going as a group of 6. First off, their happy hour looks worth it in itself, but the dinner and drink menu is great.  They are very tucked away, so it took us one time circling to find it. I liked this aspect of it because when you do find it, its quiet from the road and it makes for a really cute patio.  We started with drinks - mom got the prickly pear mojito, dad got the blood orange (everyone's favorite), sister got the white sangria, boyfriend had a margarita, and little sisters boyfriend got a regular mojito (I was boring with white wine). All of the drinks were good and strong.  Boyfriend had the short rib for dinner and man was that good! Dad and little sisters boyfriend had the pernil asado, which aside from the short rib was everyone's favorite. The flavor was slightly smokey with an all spice or cinnamon after taste which was just delicious. Little sister had the special of the night which was a sea food risotto (odd for a Mexican restaurant but no one will complain about some good fusion). Mom had the seafood chile relleno and loved it and I went with the chicken. Everything was delicious but I think I would go back for the short rib or pernil asada for sure. All of the sides were great, green beans, creamed corn, cornbread, carrots - YUM.  What I loved was the happy service along with the great food. We even got a little coupon for the next time we come in and we will be there sooner rather than later -especially to try the big happy hour menu.",

Fuego salad is delicious and is perfect to split. Some of our favorite apps include the prawns and the vegetarian tostadas. As far as entrees goes, my husband always gets the tilapia, I get the pernil pork. If you get the pork, ask for extra tortillas. The best sides by far are the chipotle mashed potatoes and the corn bread casserole. The creamed corn comes in a close third. We're always too stuffed to have dessert, but one of these days we'll give it a try.",

Not only was it live but also it was really really good! The music genre was perfect for the atmosphere. We were already impressed with the atmosphere and amazing music when we ordered chips and guac and pico de Gayo. The guac was so delicious and the  chips and pico de Gayo were super fresh at a very reasonable $6. We ordered the house salad their salmon cakes and their kids pasta with chicken. All of it was superb! I also have to note the service was also excellent! Our waitress never let our drink glasses go below half. It started to get pretty busy and I have to say our service was still excellent! In the end we ended up getting a banana burrito for dessert and there are no words to describe how delicious that was! This is definitely one of my new favorite spots to bring family and friends from out of town! We will definitely be back.",

It's a hidden gem in downtown phoenix which is at first almost annoyingly hard to find. However, when you do find it, you don't regret it!   Do yourself a favor and start off with a mojito. They make amazing mojitos. I have had the strawberry, mango, and original and all of them are good.   As far as their food, I've never really been disappointed with a meal there. The chili relleno is my personal favorite. They do it with fish and chicken and I remember both to be good. Try this place out on a day you are craving a mojito and you won't regret it!!",

    "text": "My husband and I went here for dinner for the first time a couple weeks ago. I have to say, I was a little disappointed in the place.  Based on all the high reviews, I was expecting something... I don't know, more.  The restaurant itself is really, really small and the seating is not exactly comfortable. I saw the nice patio but even that is in a courtyard without anything particularly interesting to look at.  I did like the overall decor and vibrant colors on the wall so I am not saying it is ugly or anything, just not as fab as I was expecting based on the reviews.  The menu was also really small.  There is not much to choose from, really.  We started with the empanadas which were a bit of a disappointment.  They just didn't have the same flavors or texture as other versions I have eaten at Mexican or South American places.  And it was weird that they were served with a sauce, especially one that didn't seem to complement them at all.  Fortunately our main courses were much better than the starter.  I ordered the prawns and my husband got the steak.  We both ordered the chipotle mashed potatoes and cornbread.  Usually, the first time we go somewhere new I try to order something completely different from hubby so we can sample more items but who can turn down chipotle mashed potatoes?  I make a version of these at home but I have never tried putting cheddar cheese in them.  I will definitely do that from now on because these tasted fantastic. They were really creamy and delicious with great flavor but not too spicy.  I didn't eat all of mine b/c they were a little too rich but hubby practically licked his plate.  The cornbread was equally divine.  In addition to the green chili chunks in there it also had pieces of crispy bacon.  The flavor and texture was just perfect!  The steak and prawns were both cooked perfectly and with really scrumptious sauces that complimented the meat perfectly.  Our waiter was really friendly throughout the whole experience and made sure we were happy with everything.  Overall, the food was delicious but necessarily anything unique.  In my opinion, it just didn't justify the high prices.  We spent over $80 on our meals and a couple of beers.  I am really left feeling a little confused about the experience because I think the no-frills locale and menu mean it is not really a destination restaurant but more of a neighborhood joint... but then why the high prices? I guess I just don't get it.",

Fuego had been on my list for a long time, and fellow Yelp pal Christina P generously shared her Groupon with me.  Now while there has seemingly been a lot of complaints lately about restaurants treating their Groupon customers poorly, we experienced no such negativity.  I went with the seafood chile relleno...\"scallop,shrimp, and Mahi Mahi stuffed in a jumbo Pasilla pepper with a panko crust and a lobster chile cream sauce.\"  I will let the description speak for itself other than adding, \"yes, it was that damn good.\"  As was the green chili cornbread and jalapeno creamed corn.  The restaurant is small, but they have a very lovely patio.  Someday in the distant future, it will be usable again.  Until then, I imagine a reservation would be a necessity and deservingly so.",

We didn't have reservation so we just seated in the patio. We were greeted warmly and they were very apologetic as to why we can't have a table inside.   Food: We ordered Empanadas which was beyond amazing! It's spicy but the right amount of spicy where you could still taste the filling. The sauce was phenomenal. Husband ordered their Carnitas plate and it was served in BIG portion. It was hot too which we loved. The meat was tasty and well seasoned.

I've tried many items on the menu over the years but my favorite is the breaded tilapia or NY steak, with jalapeno creamed corn and chipotle chedder mashed potatoes.  Mmmmm... so good!  We usually also get an appetizer, our favorites are usually the shrimp or the tostadas.  And the banana burrito for dessert. YUM.    They also have the best mojitos I've ever tasted and their sangria is pretty top notch as well.  Service is always excellent and we have never once had a bad experience.  We usually go nowadays when there is a Groupon so that it's a little easier on our wallets, and never have any problems.  Like with any Groupon, don't wait until that last day to try and go.  You've got plenty of time to make your reservations!    When it's not 100 degrees outside, we enjoy sitting out on the patio on weekends and enjoying live music.  The only strange thing I've ever thought about this place is that for the prices, it seems like the decor, tables, especially outdoors, would be a little nicer.  I love this place though and it doesn't bother me, just something to be prepared for if you've never eaten here before.",

    "text": "My husband and I went here for restaurant week. The waiter was very nice and it seemed the owner and his family welcomed us. We sat outside, and it was perfect weather with the misters on. I was hoping we'd eat and get our food slower, to see the band perform longer and see the twinkle lights on, but I felt kind of rushed; it was their busiest weekend of the year though, so no complaints. :-) I totally understand!  My husband doesn't drink, so I tried both the white and red sangria. :-)  I loved the white- it was so good and not too sweet (I actually thought the red was too \"berry-sweet\", if that makes sense at all).   We received a three course meal with the special, and ordered:  - House Made Green Chile Cheeseburger Empenada with Yucatan BBQ Sauce: This was mine. I don't like cheeseburger, do I don't know why I ordered it, but it was still decent. It did taste reheated; this was the only thing I wasn't a fan of.   - New Zealand Green lip mussels with chile, blue cheese, and bacon: my husband is a seafood lover, and he loved this. I tried a bit of the bacon and it was good!  - Seafood Chile Relleno filled with Scallops, shrimp.and Mahi Mahi. topped with a lobster chile cream sauce: again, my husband is the seafood lover. He made me try the sauce which tasted like lobster bisque (BLECH for me, yum for him).   - Ancho and Chile Rubbed New York Strip Steak with a hot and sweet onion and pepper relish: this was my entree. It had great flavor, was a bit too cooked, but overall good.   - House made Key Lime Pie: this key lime pie was fantastic! Hubby and I both loved it.   - Captain Morgans Amaretto Banana Burrito: this is SOOOO Bad for you! but it's so good. Literally, it's what it sounds like: a delicous banana burrito dessert. The chocolate sauce was delicious.   We both had the cheesy mashed potatoes and the corn bread stuffing. That corn bread stuffing was awesome, and if I ever go back, I think I'll make it both of my sides!  Overall, great deal for Restaurant Week, esp. since it included two drinks. If I feel like Latin food and want to take a drive (Chandler), I'll definitely go again.",

Great atmosphere and ambiance created in tucked away location in the city. I had the Seafood Chile Relleno with Chipotle mashed potatoes and their signiture side salad. I enjoyed everything each item offered with each bountiful flavored.",

Wonderful drink menu...hard to decide.  We settled on monitors, which were big and yummy.  We couldn't decide on the menu...everything sounded delish.  I has short rib enchiladas and she had roasted pork.  You get 2 sides (great offerings).  We chose cream corn (definitely not your out of the can stuff), rice, cornbread and glazed carrots.  Everything was awesome.  Service was very good. Only small suggestion...have a fan outside to keep the flies away.  I will definitely go back!",

We all ordered off the happy hour menu. The waiter brought most of our food and put it in the middle to kinda share as a \"FAMILY STYLE\"! Those that ordered Salads and Soups got their individually.   There was a little mess up on the bill we ordered a total of 3 empandas but only got 2 so the manager was nice very polite when we brought it to their attention and told us to take 6.50 off.   Because we were a ground for 7 they added gratuity to the bill and the waiter was kind enough to let us know.  The only bad thing is we were outside so I never got to really see inside, but we were also next to the dance studio that is in the same plaza and we kept hearing the same song over and over again as the kids practiced dance.  But over all I was very pleased and we will be back again!!!!",

We come to Fuego Bistro about 2-3 times a month and that says a lot because we don't like to eat out much. I order the Natural Farmed Chicken Breast, sauteed organic green beans, and jalapeno cream corn.  My Husband gets the Pork Medallions, chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes, and green chili cornbread casserole. We always order the iced tea which is always refreshed without even asking. The Banana Burrito and Key Lime Pie are so delicious. There's nothing more wonderful than sitting on the patio, sipping ice cold tea, and listening to music. We'll be there tonight!",

    "text": "As a group of five of us arrived shortly before our 7:00 reservations, we were nicely greeted by the host and we immediately seated.  Unfortunately the table we were placed at was less than satisfactory.  It was two different size tables pushed together.  One was much larger than the other but could still only sit two of us.  The other table was one that had been brought in from the outside patio made of gated iron.  Nonetheless we requested to be moved to a more comfortable table.  As we were asked to hold for a few minutes we asked if we could start with drinks.  We were quite surprised that the answer was no.  Twenty minutes after our reservation time, we were finally moved to another table.  This too was two different sized tables pushed together.  At least this time they were both from the dining room though.  We ordered a bottle of wine as well as some cocktails.  As we are awaiting our drinks, we begin to notice how unbearably warm the dining room was.  I would have to say it was close to 90 degrees at our table.  The drinks couldn't come fast enough as we all began downing the ice waters.  We made reference to the warmth in the room to the manager and his comment was this was normal as it's an old building with an old AC.  We three appetizers to share:  the signature empanadas, the organic spinach salad, and the jumbo sauteed prawns (more like large).  All were excellent!  On to a second bottle of wine and cocktails we ordered our entrees.  Two of us ordered the short ribs, one ordered the evening special (blackened fish), another ordered the pork roast, and I ordered the grilled NY Strip.  All of us ordered an array of side dishes as well.  The short ribs came out great, but as they cooled, the flavor went bland and they were ultimately dry.  We all agreed to stick to Cowboy Ciao's short ribs. The Cajun Blackened fish too came our over cooked to the point it was hardly eaten.  The pulled pork was extra tender, but lacked in flavor as well.  My strip was cooked perfectly, but I could have the same steak at Applebee's.  Unfortunately the main dishes were far from what we had expected after reading the reviews of the restaurant.  All the portions were large, but it didn't help as the food was mediocre.  On a good note, the sides were all awesome!  Fuego brought the much needed spice to the valley with their sides.  Then we all shared a piece of their key lime pie with coffee.  We believe the coffee was a generic Folgers at best.  However, the pie, especially the crust, was some of the best key lime pie we had eaten since being in the keys several years ago.  All in all, we had great company with a poor choice of a restaurant as none of us will be heading back to Fuego Bistro.  My recommendations are if you do choose to try this place, go during the winter and only order the appetizers and desserts.",

    "text": "I left Fuego Bistro conflicted tonight. Our food: empanadas, short ribs, and pork. Everything tasted great. I was especially surprised that the BBQ sauce topping on the empanada didn't ruin it but added a unique taste that fried foods often lack.  That being said, the service was awkward at best and straight up bizarre at worst. Orders were taken in a timely manner, plates were removed promptly, water was always full. The whole nine... What threw me off was that everyone we interacted with seemed like tonight was their first night. The hostess was interrupted mid-seating us by a manager that had to have a quick conversation with her. The first thing our server told us was that she didn't know our table number (with many other amusing \"stories\" to follow), AND (and this one is a big no-no- I worked in restaurants for years) I saw two busboys put their fingers in pitchers they were using to refill drinks multiple times. It's actually hard to explain what was off. I felt like I was in a movie filming the \"date at a restaurant\" scene with a bunch of actors pretending to be restaurant employees. Learning to be a good server/busser/mgr is much more difficult than it seems and acting like you know what is going on is imperative. I guess I just wouldn't have hired from the D-list if I needed a crew to come and \"play restaurant.\" I think I would return. The food really was the scene stealer. Portions were generous and very tasty. I would just expect that at their price point, there would be a little less \"WTF-ness\" to the service.",

The short rib dish was outstanding.  I loved the way the spices went against the cola flavoring.  My wife had the pernil asado, and she enjoyed that.  It should also be noted that the sides were outstanding.  We closed the evening out with the chocolate cake with ancho chiles and ice cream that had little malted milk balls in it.  One of a kind dessert, that was.  Honestly, chocolate cake desserts are so commonplace, and it's easy to forget all the different ones we've tried, but this one will certainly be remembered.  Wines were not ridiculously marked up, either (and that is a huge pet peeve of mine).  We look forward to a return visit soon, as it's right by the ancestral abode.  I just wish it was around when I used to live in Phoenix.",

We had yelped a place close to the museum,  and this one popped up, and we are glad it did.  What a wonderful find.  And the previous yelp reviews helped in ordering:  chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes, jalapeno creamed corn, the cornbread, and the raspberry mojito (of which they had many choices to pick from) .   All were as yelpers described ---- superb!   An extra bonus was  to get to this place during the happy hour (3-6) because the drinks and appetizers were  less expensive, so that convinced us to try the Empanadas for the appetizer - yum!  (but other people were raving about the chiles rellenos, as well!)  Our congenial and helpful waitress Susie suggested pernil asado (pulled pork with a special sauce), and we were so glad she did because it was the hit of the evening for us. She had also suggested the Ribs, which we probably should have ordered, too, instead of the tillapia ---- the fish was good, but just not as wow as the other food on our plates.  She suggested to have dessert, but we are sorry we were just too full to take her up on the suggestion --- and there were desserts on the happy hour list, as well!  The outdoor seating capped the whole wonderful experience.  One added thing ---- you really have to search for the sign for this place because it doesn't front on the busy street --- but it's like Oz once you leave the drab parking lot (Dorothy's home) and enter through the gates of Fuego Bistro.

    "text": "Before I launch into my critique, I need to say that Phoenix is lucky to have restaurants like the Fuego Bistro. It is so sad when places like this fold because they are not supported. I started off on a good foot with a Sagres Bohemian lager from Portugal and FB's signature empanadas. The lager had that distinct continental aftertaste (that's a good thing) without too much of that skunk you find in many Czech and German pilsners. I could tell a lot of work went into the empanadas, I just wish they were served piping hot, not luke warm. For the entree, ($21) I ordered the Cola and Pineapple Soy Braised Angus Short Rib Roast: served with a chipotle mango au jus. The operative word here is \"roast\", this dish is a roast, like a pot roast or barbacoa and not to be confused with ribs. It was very well executed, not too fatty, and so tender I was able to gently pull it apart with my fork. It is all about expectations, I really wanted ribs, but I was served a delicious braised roast . The Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes were just strange, and very dry. The simplest solution for the mashed potatoes is butter, and more butter. The Jalapeno Creamed Corn was strange also, but it was the highlight of my night. There is no question the owner had a very precise vision of what kind of restaurant he wanted to create, and to be fair, he did not fall short. Overall, my complaints are minimal and I think it's fair to balance out some overly glowing reviews. I suspect that some reviewers' judgment was mojito and mood driven. One last gripe the waitstaff seemed to interrupt every 45 seconds. The busboys kept coming over like they wanted to hustle us out so they could get on with their evening, it was a bit much, and there was at least another hour until closing..",

    "text": "Fuego is indeed hidden but not too hard to find, and not really the gem it has been labeled.  After several visits to explore the menu and sample the dishes described by other critics as wonderful, I would have to politely disagree. The Latin description actually translates to Southwestern/Mexican.  The food itself is not bad, but it is nothing exceptional from any other Southwest grill. They do know how to correctly grill a steak, but most dishes under whelm, and the over-use of chipotle sauce is many dishes is a poor substitute for seasoning skill in the kitchen. Service is fair enough, drinks are good but still not exceptional. Here is the downside -this restaurant has two seating areas, not counting the outdoor patio. One is separated from the kitchen and bar area, and has reasonable ambience. The second dining area has the bar and kitchen access. Waiters are constantly running through it, out the door, and around to the other dining area. As a result it is distracting and quite noisy. A couple announced that they were celebrating their wedding anniversary and asked their server to take their picture, which she happily obliged after asking the kitchen staff to stop running past their table.  I felt sorry for them.  On the upside, it is not a chain or cookie-cutter place and has plenty of opportunity to improve.  A rating of 3 is really quite fair all things considered. Overall it can be a fair to very poor experience for dining.",

We ate during happy hour, so the appetizers and alcohol were cheaper. Definitely enjoyed the Mojitos! I had the mango and husband had the original. Definitely recommend! Then came the empanadas, since other people said they were good. We both really enjoyed those. My husband got the asado with the cornbread casserole and chipotle mashed potatoes. The asado and the potatoes were pretty good. We would get those again. The cornbread casserole was awesome! I ordered the tilapia with the cornbread casserole and creamed corn. The creamed corn is pretty yummy too with a kick! The tilapia was ok. Not sure what made it un-exciting, considering I love tilapia. But, whatever it was, I wouldn't order it again.  Overall, I think we would go back for happy hour - just drinks and appetizers. The dinner menu is a little pricey for what you get. Maybe we would have dinner there again if the prices were about $5-7 less. I realize that it seems like a trivial amount but when the entire bill is $66, you kind of feel robbed.

To start the waitress said that Fuego makes the best mojito in town and I was so intrigued because in my mind Havana Cafe makes the best Mojito I have ever had. The mojito at Fuego doesn't stand a chance, all you could taste was the booze, no lime or mint, or sweet, just booze. We ordered the coconut shrimp to start, for -----'s sake I wouldn't be surprised if they went to Trader Joe's frozen section brought them back to the restaurant to deep fry them and there you have it the most over prices effortless appetizer you have ever sunk your teeth into. I ordered the scallops which didn't melt in my mouth, as a matter of fact they were chewy and under cooked, I was pretty disappointed, not only because of the price but because I can do much better at home in my own kitchen. My friends ordered the chicken dish and the pork. The chicken was cooked well I just didn't like the flavor combinations together. The pork was great, it had great flavor and was nice and moist. We ordered dessert and the tres leches cake was very good and the cream cheese flan is really creme brulee so if you are looking for flan drive down the street to Richardson's. Actually it will cost you about the same and the food will be 100% better the only difference would be the wait, at Richarson's on a Saturday night you might wait an hour but at fuego you will sit right down, hum? Need i say more, O 1 last thing, the presentation was sub-par. For the delicacies on the menu I was expecting presentation not piles of food plopped randomly on a plate.",

    "text": "Fuego Bistro is my favorite place for a date night or for taking friends out for appetizers and yummy drinks.  Hands down, they make the best mixed drinks in town!!  I love the drink menu and the wine selection is awesome!!  The appetizers are wonderful, the empanadas are the best, full of flavor and the dipping sauce adds some extra heat.  They plate their food like art!   I also LOVE the Tropical Shrimp Martini!  The avocado mango salsa is so sweet and wonderful.  The chips are made in house and are so crispy and flavorful! I adore the Ropa Vieja.  It's the most tender meat I have ever had!  It's so full of flavor.  I also really love the Pernil Asado.  It's also so tender and full of wonderful spices.  The sides are to die for.  I love the Arroz Con Gandules!  The Jalapeno Cream Corn is so awesome and flavorfull, a fun and different kind of side that I always ask for.  I also enjoy the salads at lunch.  They are fantastic and full of flavor!  What I love about Fuego Bistro is it's different, not the same kind of menu items you find at other places in the valley.   I take my out-of-town guests there all the time for a fun and unique experience for them.  They all love going and ask to go everytime they are in town. Fuego Bistro is the perfect size place to feel welcome everytime I go, not such a big chain restaurant.  The servers and bartenders are so friendly, so is the owner.  It's tucked away in a cute courtyard.  When I'm there, I feel like I'm out of the city and in a quaint small town in Mexico.  Please take my advice and find your way to Fuego Bistro.  You won't be disappointed!",

We arrived early during what is normally Happy Hour, but our server, Steve, and the chef accommodated our request for dinner entrees.  The service was impeccable and the food was phenomenal.  My husband had the short ribs and said they were the best he had ever experienced and I had the chicken/chorizo penne pasta, which was out of this world!  If you like spicy, I guarantee you will love this entree.  Everything about our dining experience was perfect, right down to the deep-fried chocolate banana dessert!  Arrive with an appetite and high expectations . . . you will NOT be disappointed!",

The happy hour was great, mojitos are refreshing and the food is tasty.  We split a bunch of things but what was amazing was the chipolte chedder mashed potatoes!  When the heat goes away, I will be back to sit outside and sip some mojitos!  Great place!",
