    "text": "WOW!!!!  Arizona already has the best Mexican food around, but this place is truly a gem.  All the sauces are homemade and present a wide spectrum of flavors.  My favorite unique items from the salsa bar were the peanut salsa (spicy, most likely has habaneros in it), pecan salsa (similar but very mild with interesting flavor), strawberry salsa, and jicama salsa.  Everything was incredibly fresh.  After sampling everything from our group, I would recommend getting one of their mole dishes (the mole is stellar) or the mahi mahi fish tacos.  Also, their house made guacamole was amazing; very unique and chunky with lots of different veggies in it.  I will be back again and again.",

This is what I have been waiting for since we move to Arizona 11 years ago...Let me describe the food...no wait...I can't except to say that layers of complex and subtle flavors is unique in every dish. I had tacos...These are the real deal tacos and they do not skimp on the meat! My son is a fine dining head chef and has taught me how to taste and eat really good food. This place is all of that and more...We ordered the Al Pastor Quesa to share...my sone that is without doubt the finest and most complete Quesa he has ever had in his mouth...It was to die for.  I had the El Gaucho Taco...trust me...order this! it was huge and complex...I was tasting new flavors every bite...I also got the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco...pulled pork with a hint of some spice that drove us all crazy tying to identify it...I will be back for both for sure. I waited a long time to find this place...you simply must try it...you will never go back to your heavy, greasy stand-by. I wish they had 10 starts to award. this place rocks in a way your mouth will now best!",

It had a cool Dia de los Muertos skull on the sign and I thought someone had told me about it so we stopped in for a weekend lunch.   Our server was super nice and explained about their awesome salsa bar as everyone else here has commented on. I loved the chipotle tomatillo salsa, while my husband preferred the pico de gallo and my daughter (who is 2) could not get enough of the creamy cilantro one. I had the Condesa special tacos which were awesome, especially when topped with some of that chipotle tomatillo salsa.   What was really outstanding though was the horchata. So outstanding that after finishing mine in the restaurant, I ordered another one to go. It's not like any horchata that I've ever had before as it was kind of light brown in color and had lots of chopped up fruit and nuts in it. I would go back just for the horchata!",

Parking is a SOB, look for street parking because the lot in front of the place is always packed.   Lunch time is out of control packed and the dining area is TINY so come at odd times for your best bet and shortest wait. Love the decor tho. Old school, giant wooden tables/chairs, giant local art.   20 salsas to choose from, ranging from pica de gallo to pistachio, you'll always find new ones to try. Tacos are quite good. Maybe a little pricey, but it's worth it. I always try something different because it's guaranteed to be tasty.",

The place was full when we arrived and filled with an assortment of people. It was promising.   This place did not disappoint. I had the sorano arrachero taco plate (or whatever... Something like that) and Dan got the carne asada street tacos. Right when I bit into it I knew..... This was going to be a good meal. Dan is a taco snob and gave the street tacos 10 stars. Very rare.   My tacos made me forget that our table was wobbly and that it was hard to find this place at night.  Just go and eat the tacos.... Just do it.   Food 5/5  Atmosphere 4/5  Overall 5/5",

It is a small restaurant with some very authentic details, which were really cool. The door is the old Mexico style (very popular in New Mexico) and the bar is really beautiful carved wood. They restroom in the back have awesome art on them, and the door for the mens bathroom is labeled \"Santos\" with a painting of El Santo on it. (Old time famous Mexican wrestler my father looked up to and actually my Grandfather had the pleasure of wrestling many years ago.) This was very cool for us.   The food is really REALLY good! I loved my tacos! I tried the Chicken Mole, and mine was some sort of slow roasted pork with a hint of sweet. (I can't remember the name, but it was toward the bottom of the menu.)   The people were nice, but we waited a very long time for our food. My biggest turn off was that it felt a little TOO authentic when our food came to us on real traditional Mexican pottery style plates. They seemed to be very old terra-cotta with the paint chipping off the rim of mine. I couldn't help but feel that they might not be lead free. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed my food 100% but I think it would be a little better if they upgraded to some ceramic.",

    "text": "I've technically been to La Santisima twice, but have only eaten here once. I'm so disappointed because I live nearby and wanted this to become one of my regular spots.  Tonight the restaurant had a disappointing mix-up with me. I ordered pick-up from them using yelp. I waited 15 minutes then drove the 3 minutes it takes to get there from my house. The place was packed, and there were people waiting outside as well (on a Monday night at 8pm). I tried to get someone--anyone's--attention, to no avail. The staff do not seem friendly and will ignore you and try not to make eye contact with you, even when they are just standing there. I decided to ditch the crowd and wait in my car, refreshing my order status on the yelp app; even after 25 minutes they still hadn't confirmed my order. Soon I got a call from yelp concerned that they hadn't confirmed my order.   I finally mustered the courage to go back in and push through the waiting area to speak with a staff member. They gave me a dirty look but I had to ask why they hadn't confirmed my order after such a long time. They quite nonchalantly explained to me that their yelp interface doesn't work. I told them I had prepaid and they said they couldn't do anything for me refund-wise; they didn't even think to ask if I wanted to re-order the meal I had pre-ordered via yelp. They were happy to take my money but not find out how to give me the food I had paid for. All the while, the staff member was more intent on doing something with the cashier computer than giving good customer service and talking to me.   Previously, I have ordered the gandhi tacos. They were really rather pricey for some pretty basic ingredients and flavors.   I hear this place has a great reputation; I am very frustrated by the terrible service offered. Also, if you know the yelp interface is broken, why not contact yelp to make sure no one pays for something that they inevitably will not receive? Thankfully, yelp is issuing me a refund (unfortunately I have to wait a couple days for processing). La Santisima did not own up to its mistake and made no apologies. Very unprofessional and very frustrating.",

    "text": "Really great Mexican food in Phoenix.  I highly recommend that you visit.  Everything I tried was fantastic.  We shared the Queso dip with Chorizo (which came with thin \"tortillas\", which felt very traditional).  The 1/2 order of guacamole we shared was extremely tasty.  They throw in some dried cranberries to liven up the flavor and texture profile.  Per other Yelp reviewers' recommendations, we shared the giant horchata; 1/3 of an order was the perfect amount for me, and their twist of it with fruit bits was a nice departure from the traditional horchata.    I ended up getting the gourmet Mayan Pibil taco and one of the food truck style tacos (but can't remember which protein).  They were both fantastic, and the perfect amount of food.  I really enjoyed the expansive salsa bar with over a dozen varieties of salsa.  It was fun to try most of them.  My girlfriend ordered the Quesa which was ginormous; with the chips and queso that we shared, she barely touched the quesa, it was so big, but it looked delicious.  I'd definitely come back to visit next time I'm in Phoenix.  I'm confident they won't disappoint!",

    "text": "Came as a recommendation by a friend that visited here when he was in Phoenix. I also had to come because there was HAPPY HOUR and UNLIMITED SALSA.  TINGA STREET TACO ($1.25) - wasn't too spicy - very well marinated - I originally only ordered 1 but couldn't resist and ordered another one soon after I finished the first one!  CARNE ASADA STREET TACO ($1.25) - meat was relatively tender - good but definitely preferred the Tinga Street Taco more  MARGARITA ($3) - not too strong that it tasted like alcohol but there was definitely alcohol in there. - good drink to help celebrate the beginning of the weekend.   HORCHATA ($3.99) - VERY GOOD - different from any horchata I had before; it had dices of cantaloupe, honeydew, and strawberry - super large thirst quencher  UNLIMITED SALSA BAR - any salsa from strawberry, cilantro, pecan, or pico de gallo - I almost tried everything because well I've never been to a place with so much variety - it also helped that I had unlimited chips so I just kept trying  SERVICE: nothing too special. Staff members were friendly and refilled my water appropriately.  ENVIRONMENT: a bit hidden in a not so great part of Phoenix. There is the large signage that you know it's not the wrong place. The place doesn't get too busy which was good.  Overall, great place for tacos. I can't compare it to other places in Phoenix but I did enjoy my visit. They are a bit different than the tacos I have in LA Taco Trucks mainly because I get different kinds. The price is reasonable and well UNLIMITED SALSA BAR! Also try the horchata...it's so refreshing!",

They had a good variety of vegan, vegetarian, seafood and a salsa bar to woo any salsa lover. I got the 3 street Taco plater the flavor was good only complaint was that some of the meat was dried out which I had to pick out. My husband got some seafood Tacos that he picked here and there.

You grab a menu take a set if you need a moment like I did as a first timer and when your ready you order at the counter and pay which is good to get it done and not have to wait for your bill when your finished eating.   The girl next to me had a quesadilla and looked good so I decided to try it. It's called la quencha and food presentation was nice topped with cotija cheese, red onions and avocado and green sauce but I did not expect the tortilla to be as thick as it was. It reminded me of a quesadilla chimichanga. I was full fast and the flavor was ok. I think for me next time I will try one of the specialty tacos.   They have a nice salsa bar with a variety selection .   Overall it was a nice experience and a nice first try",

    "text": "First off this is a Oaxaca style type of \"Mexican\" food. Get similar with the style.   My friend and I do taco Tuesday every week and we have seen great reviews about La Santisima. So glad we decided to give this place a shot.   We started with agua de Horchata. It was so sweet (good sweet) & different from a typical Horchata; which had strawberries and almonds mixed in. Our appetizer was Queso Fundido with chorizo. The queso is a Oaxaxa cheese, which is very thick and comes on a very hot plate with flour tortillas. We really enjoyed the cheese. Yum!  The gourmet tacos section had a variety of tacos at 3.99 each (which is on the pricey side for me) and street tacos for 2.55 each. Because we like to live on the edge we decided to go gourmet this evening. The best deal is just to get the plate for 8.95 which includes 2 tacos (same tacos) with rice and beans. I ordered the Wild Tiger Shrimp, which was breaded topped with cabbage and some type of lime sour cream on corn tortillas. It was really good once we topped out tacos with salsa. The salsa bar must of had about 12 different salsas. Guacamole was pretty spicy, more spicy than most of the salsas on the bar. The beans were amazing! Who would say that about beans, but yes I did.   Over all we loved this spot. Not sure if they have happy hour or a taco Tuesday special. The waitress did not mention any specials. I'll sure to be back.",

I actually wasn't a huge fan of any, but I combined the peanut with some other chipotle salsa and the tomatillo with another green salsa and made two amazing new salsas.  The food is indescribable. You can only understand if you eat it. I've had the carne, pibil, pastor, and mole tacos. The only one I didn't like was mole but it's an acquired taste and I think if you like mole you'll love it. The beans are also super flavorful and the rice is pretty good. It's closer to an Asian fried rice than the Mexican rice I've had, but I'm not complaining!   The horchata was also like nothing I've ever had. It had cantaloupe, pecans, And strawberries and somehow it still worked out?? You have to have it if you come here.  I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this place except that I wish they delivered to where I live (NY) hahaha",

The service here is also really great. It's a small place so the service is very fast. We got seated right away and got chips and drinks out within a couple minutes. The location is a little weird, and it doesn't look like much from the outside but the inside is very well decorated and put together.

So many amazing flavors of salsas to choose from. My favorite salsas here were the Guacamole salsa (has some heat) and Mexicana salsa (salsa Mexicana, lots of lime flavor).  I had the Dogfish Shark taco based on reviews, as well as the filet mignon taco. I wasn't overly impressed with the shark taco, there weren't any flavors that distinguished it from just a regular fish taco. However the filet mignon taco was incredible. The beef was cooked medium and tender, and the dressing/fixings was an avocado salsa with cranberries. It was delicious. There was way too much food to fit onto the tortilla (a good problem to have) so the tip is to eat a lot of the filling, then try to roll it up as a taco. The one sad thing to note was that they ran out of grapefruit juice so the house margarita wasn't as good as I've had it previously. But you definitely need to get the house margarita, it's so good. Plus it's only $5 during happy hour!  Had to ask for a water refill since the server wasn't paying much attention to our water status. That's the only constructive feedback I have.",

    "text": "Mole. That's all I have to say.  If you can eat anything containing the above listed ingredient at this restaurant, I highly recommend it. You will send your taste buds on a journey not unlike the opening credits of \"The Great Space Coaster\". Yes...I know...that dates me.  But seriously? This place is one of the best holes-in-the-wall in the downtown area. A wide array of menu items including burros, tacos, and house specialties will not disappoint. And then there's the salsa bar - which is regularly replenished - and is yours for the taking. No waiting around for someone to bring you more salsa. YOU are the salsa master. There are always at least 12-15 different and wonderful choices.   Their berry and nut topped Horchata is a delightful surprise that easily shareable. Though I'd rather have one all to myself. 'Cause I'm a greedy bastard.  I've never seen anyone seated at the bar, but with it's rich woodwork and veritable smorgasbord of tequilas, I'm half tempted to walk one day in with a 10-gallon cowboy hat, chaps, and plop down to have a couple shots of reposed...while turning my head slowly to give various people in the tiny but functional dining room the ol' stink eye. It's the only way I'll ever feel tough.  So my verdict? Go here. And eat. You won't be sorry. Todo bien.",

    "text": "Gonna keep it short(ish) and simple today.  Arrived at 6PM on a Sunday, and to say that parking is extremely limited is an understatement.  The restaurant itself is small, which explains why there weren't too many parking spots.  It was a 45 minute wait for a table for two so we ordered takeout instead.  A little crammed and loud with people talking over one another, but it was actually pretty cozy.  The staff were really nice, pleasant, and efficient even with the crowd and gave us little lids for the salsa, along with our horchata, after we placed our order.  Fast forward through standing around awkwardly in what felt like everyone's way for 20 minutes in the restaurant, we had our burros in hand - an Al Pastor burro and La Santisima burro (chicken).  The burros are pretty sizable and scrumptious.  The salsa bar is probably what sets this place apart from the rest.  It's fun and most of them have a little kick to it, so have a glass of water nearby.  I loved their horchata, it's a little sweeter than other horchatas, has more cinnamon, and the fruits (strawberries) are a great touch.  Definitely will be back, probably for takeout.",

Wasn't necessary in a great location, but I'm so glad I went in regardless.  This place is pretty small but people popping in and out in a Saturday afternoon. Definitely a good sign but again I kinda want to keep it as my own secret place.  Got a their Cabo Shark taco and it was absolutely amazing. Also tried a bite from one of their shrimp tacos. Again amazing. Definitely coming here again.",

    "text": "Worth any wait,  ours was minimal.  Horchata and salsa bar were great highlights!   Loved the decor and character of the place.  Dia del morte all about including cool mosaic tile art. We walked right up past the bar to look up menus and wait on a table.  No tables available.  I was directed to use the men's room.  Which was decorated yet cluttered with a music stand,  stool,  and supplies.  I couldn't open the slider lock easily and had feared they'd have to break the door down but I got lucky and got out.   By the time I got out,  only a few minutes,  my friend was seated.  Tunes were good,  Even when I couldn't understand the music I was grooving.   Menu was a bit overwhelming with so many choices.  Got the best horchata ever with strawberries, cantaloupe, and pecans.  It was mammoth.   Settled in on a fish taco and Mahi Mahi,  both grilled.  They were hot to handle,  and a bit over filled.  Nice because good value,  but the bottom tortillas were soggy.   Only got two bites of this delishness in,  because I filled up on chips and fun salsas from the salsa bar.  The horchata contributed too.   The peanut salsa was the hottest,  and the salsa de albor was my first experience with this fruity hot Mexican Chile.  The jicama was nice and refreshing and cooling but very hard to get on the chip as by its nature wasn't saucy.  However the cilantro was too soupy so I could only pour it on.  The pecan wasn't spicy like the peanut and was therefore nice against the heat as well.",

My husband had the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco Plate. Tender and moist meat, he ate it with the Salsa Pecan from the Salsa Bar. The rice was OUTSTANDING. And the House Margarita was one of the best he ever had.  I had the El Gaucho Taco and a Carne Asada taco ala carte. Both ON POINT. And the horchata? ENORMOUS. The melon, berries and pecan at the bottom were such a treat at the end of a satisfying beverage.  I read some complaints about service. This place is small and every table was taken when we arrived. The two wait staff people were great. They were busy, the restaurant was full, and they were sharp. If you are in a hurry, don't come here. If you aren't and you are willing to stand at the bar with a drink and wait (which we did), it is ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT.",

A decision should be made if this is a full service restaurant or a cash and carry establishment. There is little to no regard for patrons entering the front door. Be prepared to be treated as an afterthought as they either do not have enough staff or are too busy playing multiple roles. It appears that take out orders are the priority.  The salsa bar is great. It also serves as a distraction from the fact the service is slow and food order/delivery is 30 minutes away. Make sure you order drinks, food,etc. all at once. My experience was \"piece ordering\" compounding the wait.   Overall, I will return for the food.. Take out only",

Incredible offerings and a blending of flavors you'll be hard-pressed to find elsewhere.  We've been to both locations, but for whatever reason, prefer the 16th Street location over the Glendale location. Same food, same wonderful service - just personal preference.  Tacos: Al Pastor, Carne Asada, Oaxacan Black Mole, Chicken Asado. All excellent, super flavorful, seasonings not overpowering and well presented. The mole is probably the best I've ever tasted. Hint of cinnamon/spices, chocolate & chilies. Just the right blending of flavors to bring you back for more. Looking for something out of the box? Try the Arabe Burro. Al Pastor pork with hummus lettuce, cucumber and even some Tzatziki! Very refreshing. They also offer quite a number of vegetarian offerings.  La Santisima also boasts a homemade salsa bar unlike any you've seen. This really gives the customer the opportunity to try flavors and you just may find you've discovered a new favorite! The salsa made with peanuts is very good - really! And don't forget the adult beverage - the hand made house margarita is very good, too!  Restaurant is very unpretentious. Small in size. Glendale location has parking in the rear, street parking in Phoenix.  Neither location is close by our neighborhood, but worth the drive for great food.",

I thought north phoenix was really only pawn shops, tire shops, and smoke shops, but my gf had heard of this place so we made a special journey out to La Condesa. After checking to make sure our doors were locked 4 times, we entered this \"gourmet\" taco shop...and boom all my misconceptions were erased.  This place is extremely clean and friendly. The tacos I ordered were overflowing with flavor and ingredients. I was thoroughly filled after two tacos.  I had the Shrimp tacos - not the cabo ones, i think they were simply grilled and guess what? that's right, no diarrhea afterwards. Also had the the sonoran carne asada tacos....which were arrachera steak marinated with fresh garlic & olive oil, charbroiled with mesquite charcoal. The tacos were amazing and the salsa bar was mind blowing. The yhave about 12 salsas to try from and I had to try them all. My personal favorites were the cilantro, chipotle and the surprisingly  yummy peanut salsa.  I REALLY wanted the horchata, but they had just run out..i won't ding them for running out because we did come in 5 minutes before closing.

Napkins couldn't soak up the grease fast enough. Salsas available, because some were empty were quite tasty. Ambient- sound bounced of the walls and couldn't really have a talk with out contributing to the already loud room. Lighting not great. Beautiful mexican culture inspired art. Loved it. Service- not good. Sat us down and then disappeared had to stop them and ask any of the employees to put in our order, refills, and our check. The worst part was... there wasn't that many people. Other- loved there terra cota plates. Cups were paper cups, and they had nice silver wear. Couldn't figure out whether it was nice dinner restaurant or just a dive.",

They didn't bus the bar for us. We were passed by several times with no eye contact. I've been here before and the food is great but the service is terrible. We had to walk out 15-20 minutes after sitting down. Sad because I really love the food here but this makes us not want to come back",

The pork is marinated and has great flavor, the inclusion of pineapple adds sweetness which works great with the savory flavor of the pork.  My personal favorite is the chicken mole which is not for everyone but I love it.  The mole sauce has great depth of flavor.  It is made from unsweetend cocoa and chiles.  Unusual but delicious!    The salsa bar has a great selection.  I recommend the chipotle salsa with its smoky flavor.  The tomotillo and guacamole are excellent.",

They also feature a super salsa bar with (I thing I counted right)12 different types of salsas! The guacamole salsa is spicy to watch out. They have a cilantro pecan salsa which I found surprisingly tasty. You must get several to find your personal favorite. They have expanded from a living room sized dining to the next door pad.

Their salsa bar also has creative, delicious salsas. The people are friendly. The prices are good, not super cheap, but around $12 for lunch and more than worth it. They expanded into a second big room. It used to be a bad place for lunch because everything was so packed together, but now there's no reason not to go. Well, except for the parking, but just find something on a side street and walk half a block.",

You order at the counter and then find a seat.   We ordered an assortment of tacos. A unique option that they offer is to order a protein taco. Instead of the tortilla, it was replaced with an egg. It was delicious, but filled us up quickly. If you go this route, consider ordering a taco or two less than you normally would. Not sure how many eggs they use per taco but it's probably between 1 and 2. I don't think this extra protein option widely advertised. My friend found this option somewhere on the menu, and we didn't know about it until he received his order. We were perplexed by what he ordered because he was the one who was enthusiast about tacos, and it didn't look anything like a traditional taco. Great option if you would like to go with the no carb option. I've never seen this at any other Mexican restaurant before.   Our favorites were the Sonoran carne Asada taco and the shrimp tacos! They also offer a salsa bar and complimentary chips while you wait for your food. Fast service and delicious food!",

The street tacos, the service, and the salsa bar were the standouts for us.  We had no wait when we entered on a Friday at 1:30 and were seated at the two top right by the bar. We were served by I believe one of the owners or managers and he took great care of us also answering questions and offering suggestions. The tacos are divided into a \"gourmet\" and \"street\" section, priced at $3.99/$2.25 respectively. If you don't want your protein in a taco, they also serve burros, quesadillas, and lonches. If I had my dirty menu police badge on, I would have cited them for one count as there was a couple splotches of salsa verde on my menu.  We upgraded to two combos for a buck and change so we could have some beans and rice. And of course we sampled plenty of salsas while eating our chips. I enjoyed all three of the street tacos we ordered. The shark taco was overcooked and the corners were tough. The black mole was different with a deeper flavor with bitter notes and very mild sweetness. For two combo plates with 5 tacos, $20 was an affordable price. I'll definitely see what else they have to offer on the next train stop.",

Gave away the other half (more like 2/3) of my burrito n I hope this was just an off kitchen day  Sooooo being on Food Network elevated my expectations when I saw the sign inside after I ordered .. The salsa bar is definitely nice but means nothing if they're not all on point. I'd rather have 2-4 really good salsas vs 12-14 mediocre ones. Much better tacos, salsas/salsa bars out there (Ta'Carbon or Tacos Sahuaro) than here. The staff is friendly, the space is small but soon expanding I believe. The burro (La Santisima) w arrachera (carne asada) was disappointing; everythg just seemed muddled as far as flavor, it was one note. The spinach came through n the carne was nothing different than what u may find at filibertos. A return is still up in the air.",

You can definitely get buy with three tacos, four if you're super hungry like I always am and feast in all the deliciousness! The salsa bar is fantastic here as well as the guacamole.   Ignore the fact that they've been on Food Network and have gotten a bit more touristy; the food is still legit and isn't that all that matters? So stop by, have a margarita and chow down on some delicious tacos.",

I came here a month ago with some friends and we drove separately. Some of them got there first which was good because they were able to snag us a table for 6 in this small restaurant. Since it was a Friday night, it was busier than usual and several parties had to wait or go elsewhere.   Their menu has a lot of options even for vegetarians, which is nice. I ordered a taco plate with three different kinds: aguacate, la santisima veggie, and the cactus one. I did like them, but I would've enjoyed them better if they were served in flour tortillas rather than corn. I'm not a corn tortilla fan. The salsa bar is fun to try, I got the strawberry one to balance out the spicier ones like chipotle. The beans were tasty too.   Service was good and we got our food in a timely manner. I just wish they had more space and alternate choices for tortillas.",

Add in the massive salsa bar and I was a fan before I even tried a bite.  This place is tiny, so go off normal dining hours or expect a wait. We lucked out and got seats at the bar, and ended up getting to try an extra margarita that was accidentally made for a large party. While you wait for your order, cozy up to the salsa bar, where they have ten different options ranging from mild to mouth-on-fire. The strawberry one was my favorite, but the tomatillo was really good too.  We ended up trying five different tacos, and they were all good in their own ways- this is a place to skip the generic fried fish tacos and go for the stuff that's really out there, like chicken mole and things you have difficulty pronouncing correctly. Will be coming back next time I'm in town to try more!",

The place is small but seats quite a few people. You may also sit by the bar to eat (which is what we did since we didn't want to have to wait forever to eat).   I had 3 carne asada tacos with rice and beans. The meat was well seasoned and they double up on tortillas so they def won't fall apart.   The highlight for me was the salsa bar. Omg it was yummy! They have your traditional salsas, like salsa verde, salsa bandera etc, but also have very inventive yet delicious spins on the ordinary, like their salsa siete chiles (7 types of roasted chiles with red onion and it was super chunky) or another salsa made with a base of chopped radish.    It was great that they also gave us a basket of super crispy chips to enjoy with all the salsas.   The ONLY thing that I did not like was that I saw drinks poured at the bar and the bar tender grabbed the fruit out of the open bin with his bare hands. I had a bottled drink, but would have not asked for a drink if the bar were the only option. Just to be clear, the kitchen staff had gloves and you could see into the kitchen, which was organized and clean.",

The fish taco was really basic. The salsa bar is ok, even though it has more of a variety than most they are not that good. I tried all of them and most were pretty bland maybe one was spicy. I'd say the spiciest one was maybe a little hotter than siracha. I've only been once so they could have been out of something. The rice and beans are decent, better than most chain Mexican spots. The horchata was the best part, we may go back just for a couple horchatas to go. Overall I think most will like it, I had high expectations considering a close friend was telling me to go and the menu looks great.",

    "text": "I came here on a Saturday for brunch around 11am and were seated in the front room which is kind of dark. I saw the main room on the way to the bathroom & asked to be moved because it's so much brighter & nicer in there. Not sure why we weren't set there to begin with considering it wasn't super busy at the time.  La Santisima's main room is decorated with Dia De Los Muertos inspired artwork -- pretty cool! There's also a salsa bar that has a great variety of sauces! I tried them all & my favorite was a smokey, spicy salsa roja; it was hot but not over-powering & still had fresh acidity which I love.  Their taco trios have a lot of different protein options - I chose their Mayan Cochinita Pibil, Sonoran Carne Asada, & Aztec Tinga. So unique & delicious in their own ways but my favorite was definitely the Tinga.   Chilaquiles in roja & verde salsas with scrambled eggs were so tasty with generous portions.  My dining companion said it reminded him of his grandmother's chilaquiles which seems a pretty strong endorsement! Next time, I'd probably opt for an over-medium egg to add some yummy yolkiness.  Overall -- a great experience with tasty, authentic food, & lots of variety! Definitely would recommend :)",

I ordered a pork/tomato/onion \"not a\" torta, and it was most certainly a sandwich with mustard and mayonnaise??  That didn't seem authentic.  But I ate the thing- it was good.  But I would get tacos or a burrito next time... if there is one.  DUN DUN DUNN!  MILEY, WHAT'S GOOD? The salsa bar is great... though the best ones (\"guacamole\") were empty the Friday lunch hour I went.  Chunky pico is good.  Strawberry salsa?  Um ok.  Peanut salsa.  Sure.  Cilantro salsa- tasted more like bell pepper to me.  Hit and miss, but fun to try them all regardless.    DRINKS? Skinny margarita so watery my wife switched the beer. But the iced tea is good and comes in a big 32 ounce cup so you don't have to bother anyone for refills.  And you get your own water bottle.   Kinda of a fun, dark, (maybe too) little dive w/ good service.  Would be greater if they could extend the bar to more than three seats.",

I had a chicken mole taco which had just a couple too many red onions on it (which were easily dispatched). The mole was rubbed into the chicken rather than glooped on top, so the fragrant smokiness really soaked into the chicken. I liked this taco even better with a spoonful of the juicy strawberry salsa on top.  I also sampled the carne asada burro. Simple handmade flour tortilla (I could eat them plain for days), filled with black beans and beef. The meat had a deep flavor and was slow-cooked tender. Again, a dollop from the large assortment of salsas, this time the creamy cilantro, made good taste great.  My calabacitas were grilled just right: nice char marks, but with some body still left to the slices.   La Condesa only loses a point because the chips could have been better (fresher) and the parking in front is rather harrowing. Otherwise, it is going in the regular rotation. I hope they have t-shirts sometime soon with some of the amazing artwork!",

From the folk Mexican art depicting Santo and Freda Kahlo's uni-brow to the leather and rough wood La Condesa is as much a treat to the eyes as to the nose and mouth.  We are so used to fiery Tex-Mex here in Arizona that it is hard to believe that there is another side to good Mexican food....a delicacy of flavor that counts on subtle textures and refreshing herbs and vegetables to cool our palates and the heat of Southwest days.  I tried every one of the salsas available on Saturday and I can still taste the peanut salsa while I dream of the strawberry salsa (and the cilantro cream salsa and the chipotle...you get the picture).  We split the dogfish and carne asada tacos along with a mahi burrito and were too stuffed to make our way any farther down the menu, guaranteeing we'll be back for more.  Any complaints? Only the smallest of one....I actually prefer water to soft drinks with my meals and appreciate a reasonably sized cup (I promise I won't steal the Coke). I was given an 8oz styro cup filled with ice, necessitating several trips to the counter to ask for more. Totally rediculous since the soft drink dispenser is behind the counter and I couldn't rip them off if I wanted to ;-) ....and yet another styro cup waiting over a thousand years to biodegrade in a landfill.  La Condesa is what a good taqueria should be, just make sure to weedle a paper cup out of the cashier if you quieres agua.",

A lot of their food tends to be on the spicy side, but not all. The house-made beverages (horchata and jamaica) are very good. The guac is chunky and very citrusy, which I approve of. Do not hesitate to check this place out, but be forewarned that parking can be challenging and the location is small and crowded.

As a salsa and hot sauce (they're different, people!) fanatic, I tend to judge Mexican food joints based on their quality of salsa - and La Condesa ranks high!  Last time I was there, I counted 10 different salsas and 2 or 3 different condiments (limes, onions, etc.).  They offer a wide range of salsas from their exotic strawberry salsa, to spicy chipotle, or creamy cilantro.  It looks a little silly with 8 little cups on salsa at your table, but you have to try them all!   The horchata here is also 5-star material.  Don't be a cheapskate - shell out the $4 for it! Its giant, it will make you happy. And, when you're done with it you can eat the fruit and nuts - the drink keeps on giving!   I have been here twice and have only eaten the veggie tacos, 2 of them are enough to fill me up and they are very delicious!  I must say I am not a huge fan of their rice and beans, which seem a bit bland to me.  But, the tacos, salsa and drinks all make up for some plain 'ol rice!   I was very  happy to see a decent sized crowd here on my most recent visit and that La Condesa is applying for a liquor license.  This place needs to stick around for awhile!",

But the one that got me was the shark tacos , now thats a taco ! Just wish the would recomend the sauces/ salsa to put on it that would help bring out more flavor. They have so many salsas I WANTED TO TRY ALL OF THEM !  Great place for a good lunch and awsome concept ! if you have'nt tried it , you must go once its a fine meal for $10. Happy hour prices seem to be reasonable also. I will be back again i must say and will ask more questions about the sauces.",

They give you soft drinks in a to go cup so that was convenient to take with me in the 100 degree weather.   The food was really good and was better than similar tacos in CA.

My husband had their marinated shredded pork in a burrito and got sick after taking the first bite. This must be an acquired taste, it was gross, really gross. Then I found what looked like a gray slimy booger in my rice. When I pointed it out to the server he took my plate away and came back saying it was an onion!! No way was that an onion, or even a close relative of an onion. No apology, no asking if i want something else, he just came over, slammed the bill down and said we didn't charge you for your food, so don't worry about it, and walked away.

It costs $5 for two a la carte large tacos served on fresh corn tortillas that are filling.  There are a variety of choices, you cannot go wrong. The meats are all prepared with strong spices, and cooked appropriately without being dry. The seafood is well seasoned, and kept moist after preparation and frying. Best of all, there is a salsa bar with over 10 different types of fresh salsas to accompany your dishes.  My only gripe is that there aren't additional \"authentic\" cuts of meat like lingua or tripe. But still, everything done here is done exceptionally well.",

Between a family of 4, we had street tacos, quesadilla , and the pork burrito with some great seasoning ( can't remember the name of it).  All of it was super tasty.  Don't forget to try all the salsas, each one of them offer a great addition to the food provided.  Finally I leave with this.... My kids asked if the restaurant had churros, so I asked and they mentioned they recently took them off the menu.  Waiter very nicely apologized and said sorry we don't have them anymore.  2 mins later the guy came back as we were signing our bill and told me he could make them for us.  They had the ingredients.  Within 5 mins my two kids had not only churros, but churros with strawberries, chocolate, Carmel and pecans on the plate.  Well presented and very delicious!! To top it all off I asked them to provide me a new bill for the dessert and he said its on the house.  There not on the menu, no need to charge u.  :) :).  Please don't use this against;).  What a fantastic experience!!  10 stars!!",

I had two tacos and rice and beans.  The cochinita pibil taco was very good but the star of the show was the Aztec tinga.  So flavorful, so fat, so hot!  Man, good thing I had a horchata to cool the flames.  The horchata was very good but around halfway through it became nearly impossible to drink through the straw because of the fruit and nuts.

    "text": "You may need several visits to try all of their different gourmet tacos.  If you are indecisive about choosing among multiple great menu items like I do just get the 3-taco sampler (comes with beans & rice) and whatever three tacos jump out at you.  Then go back again and try different ones.  We got the chicken tinga, cochinita pibil (done right), Oaxacan mole negro (a flavor explosion), 2 Andalusias (chorizo and potato - hard to find a better combination), and chile en nogada (a chile stuffed with fruits, nuts and meat, topped with a sweet, creamy sauce - very different).  All were great.  Each taco has a double corn tortilla and is a pretty good size but not enormous.  I was stuffed.  Some of the more gourmet tacos are a small upcharge, but for 50 cents or a dollar per taco go ahead and splurge! The help-yourself salsa bar had about a dozen different house-made salsas including pico de gallo, peanut, pecan, cilantro, guacamole, and many more.  My two favorites: chile de Arbol (smoky & a little spicy) and seven chiles (mild, chunky chiles and charred red onion). Horchata: is a large 32 oz and has strawberries & almonds to make it more festive than your normal horchata. Because this place advertises itself for \"gourmet tacos\" we didn't even look much at the rest of the large menu. A lot of people around us ordered burritos. Location: the few parking spots out front on the main street were full so we parked down the side street, slightly nervous about the loudly-arguing people across the street, then the crazy-talking-out-loud-to-herself person with the shopping cart on the corner.  But the food was worth it and our rental car was still there and intact when we returned. Customers included a combination of locals and tourists.  We had a twenty minute wait for a table of two around 6:30 on a Saturday night.  It was well worth the wait.  Will make it a point to try this one again when we're back in Phoenix.",

THE UGLY: the food doesn't taste like there is a thoughtful process in its creation any more. have they changed owners? everything we ordered here was run-of-the-mill, not ravingly good as we'd experienced previously. the fish in their tacos was fishy, which is never a sign of freshness.  so disappointed because a meal here used to be worth a special trip.",

First I thought ewww peanut and pecan salsa?? I was so wrong don't judge a book by it's cover the salsas where delicious! I ordered the shark tacos omg they where yummy I was licking my fingers lol and didn't care who saw I was happy enjoying my plate. With the plate came beans and rice, the rice was moist and soft. One thing have to applaud is the lady that was our server I totally should of asked for her name she needs to be recognized on top of being a friendly employee she also has integrity. Let me explain, so I basically ate and left on my way home I was looking for my most precious thing ugh oh my cell phone where is it?? We all know that scary sad feeling. To make things short I went back to the restaurant and who was there at the cashier greeting me with a smile and raising my phone up high the wonderful employee!

I really enjoyed the way that the restaurant was decorated; it definitely creates its own vibe, and it's not painted with a lot of loud colors (there are a ton of pictures of the decor if you look at the pictures). It's very classy to say the least.  The salsa bar is the first thing that I have to mention. It was overflowing with variety and flavor. Every time that I thought I'd found one that I liked, I tried another and pushed the previous aside. My girlfriend and I managed to polish of two baskets of chips without a problem or remorse because we had to try every salsa. The tamatillo and cilantro were two of my favorites in the mix.   We also ordered the Mayan Conchinita Pibil tacos and the Aztec Tinga tacos. I'm usually hesitant about chicken on tacos because I usually always have bad experiences, but not here! The tinga taco was great. The meat was tender and well marinated - I could taste the sauce in every bite. The conchinita though is what really won me over. The pork was so good! Imagine the tenderness and juiciness or your favorite BBQ pork sandwich, but replace the flavor with a bevy of delicious Mexican spices and we'll pretty much be on the same level.  I'm pretty baffled that I didn't see a lot of my Yelp friends raving about this place. As a result, I will send this review out to you all (go try it =) ). This is a great little place that isn't pricey yet brings great flavor. The next time I got there I will be getting a quesa, no question, and hopefully I will be going back very soon.",

    "text": "Huge and delicious Horchata! Strawberry salsa! Shrimp taco!  Those are what I had at my first visit. First it a little bit hard to find the place because we did not know exactly where this place is located at. Once we stepped inside, the artwork on the wall blew us away.   We started off with the chips and 10 different kinds of Salsa. This is the incredible ideas since none of us love the same kinds of Salsa. I loved Strawberry one. My husband loved 7 chilies. Others also love different kinds, such as green chili and jicama.  Then our meals arrived shortly after. A basket full of tacos, rice and bean. They are all delicious and I have never had the shrimp tacos this good before.  I am glad that La Condesa is not to far from where we live. It is our new spot to go get some delicious food.",

I think I would have loved many of the salsas, but they ran out of cups & had small plates to put the salsas on instead. Dude, it's really hard to dunk a tortilla chip into a plate of salsa. I tried the cilantro & the tomatillo & both were great, but couldn't muster the effort trying to scrape another flavor off the bottom of a plate.  The Mayan pork taco was damn near perfect, but I thought the chicken mole was a little too much on the sweet side.",

We came here on a sunday evening, with a -very- hyperactive 5 year old in tow-as the restaurant itself is -very- small, even the smallest sounds he made felt like they would bring on an avalanche- or maybe I was just self conscious, as no one seemed to mind.  The staff were very attentive and kind, the food arrived super quickly.  And now onto the food-O M G I had the Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken tacos- they were <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fincredible.Rich&s=8ce1a21e552e26ae7c31e3bca8f92318f19c59dc3b3f4608499c45c7c793c579\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">incredible.Rich</a>, thick, delicious, amazingggggggly good. My son had Mayan Cochinita Pibil tacos[banana leaf roasted pork shoulder], and though usually I do not like pork, but from what I had of his, was delicious.  Husband had Aztec Tinga[shredded chicken] bowl, with a fresh tortilla the size of a UFO saucer.   There is a salsa bar with about 12-16 different, freshly made salsa;from pico de gallo to more exotic offerings such as strawberry salsa[the bomb], creamy cilantro salsa, creamy cashew .etc etc.All were super fresh and very tasty.  We will definitely be back-the mole sauce alone was worth the drive!",

We found that and more. In our one month since we've moved to Phoenix, we've eaten here three times. By far the best item we've had is the fried quesadilla with mole chicken. Oh, and the horchata. Best. Horchata. Ever. It's not your typical horchata, so watch out. Mole poblano tacos are also heaven, as is the cochinita pibil. Salsa bar is to die for.   I love the hole in the wall vibe. Only bad moment was that I got trapped in the bathroom, but that was my fault. I swear the door opens out, not in. This place is super casual. Plastic cups and nothing fancy, but the vibe is uber awesome. It is very small, and seating can be limited, but it always seems to work out. I don't recommend this place for very large groups.

My pal and I went to LCGTS on our way to see Cheech and Chong at the Dodge Theater.  So we were up for some good Mexican food munchies.  We walk in and there is a line... okay no big deal.  BUT there were no forks (we had to eat with spoons and fingers).  There were no napkins, and the salsa bar was bone dry.  I mean the salsa trays looked like they had been licked clean by a starving dog.  They were able to replenish the salsa but they completely ran out of forks.  We got no chips and no drinks.  We had to beg the poor, nice girl who was completely stressed out.  They were a tad understaffed.  It was a \"trip\".    But somehow they managed to bring out my dish.... a Chicken Mole burrito and a Carne Asada Steak taco.  OMG were they amazing.  The flavors of those dishes and the flavors of the AMAZING salsa were just super.  The meat in that taco was cooked to perfection.  Crusty bits of steak that had a crunchy sear but were still very tender on the inside.  I didn't mind not having a fork.  While we were there, they LOCKED the door, just like Cheech Marin did in the Vampire den in \"From Dusk till Dawn\".  We were locked in as prisoners.  Apparently they were closing down at 6:45 p.m. due to being understaffed and not having forks or more salsa.  Luckily, my buddy and I were the last people to be served.  I will definitely go back.",

Their quesadillas are like a thick fry bread, I though they we're too greasy but everyone else raved.  Leave extra time to check out, it took longer than the meal.",

    "text": "Well... couldn't help it... gotta bump this up to a perfect five stars after our last visit. Our first visit we tried every taco on the menu... this time we tried a quesadilla, an Oaxacan Black Mole Burro, and for good measure a regular old bean burrito because we wanted to try their beans. On top of that I just had to get another 'Dogfish Shark' taco because it was my favorite, and instead of the Horchata we tried their Jamaica drink...mmm.   The quesadilla was very different, made with a really thick corn tortilla with sour cream drizzled all over it... damn good. Perfect to tear pieces off of and dip in the different salsas. The two burros we tried were equally tasty... and just like last time the chips were spot on. What's not to love about this place? It's just one of those 'easy to fall in love with' little holes in the wall.   I think I'd give just about anything for them to start selling their salsa's to-go... especially after our last visit and finally being able to try the much talked about strawberry salsa; it really is as good as everyone says it is... heaven in a sauce basically. Whoever the mad scientist is behind these salsas really deserves a pat on the back, because I'm hooked.   From what I've been hearing this place is slowly starting to get busier and busier... it puts a smile on my face to see good food and good businesses succeed based on word of mouth. In my ideal world there'd be a La Condessa on every other corner, instead of a Taco Bell... eh, baby steps I guess. 5/5.",

    "text": "My definition of Central Phoenix ended at around the 12ths on both sides, but this place and Urban Beans have taught me the folly of my ways.  Condessa is a simple and beautiful spot, serving a different, more expansive menu than most of the other Mexican restaurants I've been sampling.  First impressions won me over on first step in, I am in love with the Dios los Muertos art aesthetic and they have some beautiful works adorning their walls and doors.  The self-described gourmet menu was enticing, many selections I've never seen in person, only read about in my food travel readings, so I was intrigued.  I really wish I was more hungry, I settled on the Queso which was recommended by my server.  The food takes a bit of time to prepare, but that does give you time to enjoy the salsa bar, which this day included 10 varieties including strawberry, chipolte, a creamy cilantro, guac, pico, can't remember them all.  When my Queso came I was a bit shocked by it's size and relativity to fry-bread, not that this is a bad thing.  The pork inside was unbelievable, comparable in portion size and taste to that of much more expensive places.  Fried cheesy porky goodness, topped with rotating different salsas, each bite was another slice of heaven.  My gripes:  I have much respect for the work they put in to make this food outstanding, but they are shooting themselves in the foot with the plastic silverware,  cheap baskets and togo cups.  I know doing dishes is annoying, but you need to match your great food with great accoutrement.  After writing this, I'm going back today.  Yum.",

I don't know...I asked my buddy...he's a trained physician and he didn't know either (so what good is he?...unless I need a heart transplant and then, you know...he's a god:)  As I contemplated all of the fresh and interesting selections available at the salsa bar, I thought to myself \"well, it's a bar, why don't I just pull up a chair and make a day of it?\" :-)  After The Countess herself came out and asked me to please eat at my own table and quit embarrassing myself and my lunch buddies, I remembered that this kind of thing is what got me banned from the Top of the Mark in San Francisco (although I will tell you what I told the SFPD...having a Caviar Bar with bar stools in close proximity is just asking for it:)  We finished our delightful lunch without further incident and agreed that this place should be much closer to our respective homes and open 24/7 so we can walk over and grab a burro or a platter of tacos whenever we feel like it...which would be pretty much every day, for at least 2 meals:)  Do you think The Countess will go for that?",

The owners sure had a nice vision and succeded in creating a great spot for the neighborhood.  The tacos and quesadilla I've had here was nothing less than spectacular.  Having lots of flavor and not skimping on the portions. The salsa bar is quite fun as well with many different and uniques choices to choose from.  Never seen so many salsas offered anywhere else and I'm sure I will make it through all of them with my many visits to follow.  Keeping the flavor of the area being on the edge of a very artsy neighborhood the decor is amazing.  Vibrant paintings all around and murals on the bathroom doors definitely makes this place stand out with style.  This place is a must see for anyone who likes great food and culture.  Take a deep breath before you walk in and inhale an experience I am sure you will remember.",

    "text": "Oh Food Network, how you have let me down. Honestly, I should have known better because Guy Fieri seems to always think everything that goes into his mouth in his show Diners Drive-Ins and Dives is \"dynamite.\" Seriously, I mean, has he ever said anything negative? I've been to many restaurants he had endorsed on his show and have generally been disappointed... La Santisima would be on that list as well. I can't just blame Guy though, because Yelp also has raving reviews for it. Perculiar...  I came here an hour before closing time on a Wednesday. No wait. We were given a complimentary basket of freshly fried tortilla chips. I was impressed when I was told by the waitress of their selection of 18 sauces at the sauce station. Who doesn't love sauce?! Unfortunately I tried nearly half of them and none of them really stood out. For my meal, I decided to order the tacos since that is what they are known for. I got three a la carte gourmet tacos which were $3.99 a piece: pacific white fish taco, aztec tinga taco, and el gaucho taco. They all tasted just okay which was a disappointment because from all the reviews I was expecting some sort of out-of-body experience when, in fact, I've had way better tacos just about everywhere else. I had a taste of my husband's chicken quesadilla (I think the La Santisima Specialities Quesa) which I thought was actually better than the tacos. Still not awesome, but better. The crust was thick which is unlike any quesadillas I've had before. The quesadilla comes in a rather large portion and is very hearty.   Overall, this place is definitely overhyped. I rather have Taco Bell.",

The list of Mexican restaurants and taco shops is endless in Phoenix and while I can't possibly try them all, I have at least found one I thoroughly enjoy.  From the quality of meat, to the portions, to the highly touted salsa bar, this place delivers on all levels!  I started with a half order of guacamole to compliment my assortment of chosen salsas.  Their guac tends toward the chunky side mixed with red onion, tomato, mango, and cilantro.  The chips were disappointing, but they served their purpose of sampling salsas and the guac.  I also heard great things about the horchata, which I can never pass up when available.  First of all, it comes in a massive 32 oz cup.  I would definitely share this with somebody else next time.  It's also loaded with strawberries and mangos, which I initially thought seemed unnecessary, but provided a unique twist.  The fruit proved difficult to fit through the straw, so maybe I'll order without in the future.  I ordered 3 of the gourmet tacos - El Gaucho Taco, Baja Sur Shark Taco, and Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco. All were $3.99 and excellent and I would say the Cochonita Pibil was the best I tried!  It went really well with the salsa cilantro, a cream based cilantro salsa.",

First off, what the heck kind of quesadilla are the making?  I am still not sure.  Why fry a tortilla and throw some cheese in the middle, it just doesn't make any sense to me.  I love quesadillas, but this one was not good.  Second, the \"carne asada\" was not good.   It just didn't have much flavor.  The only burrito that I liked was the shrimp burrito, although I didn't realize that it had mushrooms in it, which was disappointing.   The salsa bar is very good.  The tortilla chips are ok.  The location leaves a little bit to be desired and so does the food.    I am sure many will go to this place based on yelp, but I was not impressed.",

    "text": "My grand finally in Scottsdale came the evening I went to La Santisima.   I wanted to some good Mexican food before I left the west coast,  so I looked this place up and based on the Yelp reviews I made the journey.   It was about a 35 minute drive from my hotel in Scottsdale,  but well worth the trip.     The place isn't that big,  but it's very clean and pretty traditional.   The whole time I was there I heard bob Marley playing.   It was odd,  but cool at the same time since I expected mariachi music playing.   Anyhow,  me and my friends placed our orders and came to the salsa bar.   This had to have had the most variety in salsa that I've seen.   Tasted a few salsas for my chips and ordered a few alcoholic drinks which were fantastic.   I tried the peach margarita and my friend had the strawberry one.   The food was also delicious!  I had the asada burrito smothered and my friend had the chicken quesadilla.    The quesadilla is pretty stuffed and filling.   I would definitely come back and have lunch or dinner here in the future.",

They have this great salsa bar that is their calling card and you literally can not see what you are selecting. They also have a beautiful, ornate, hand carved bar that is completely dark.   The service is outstanding and the clientele is a great mix, from hipster to subarban.",

It's small and a little cramped but the people who run the place ( I believe it's family-owned) are always pleasant to us. Being Caucasian, this isn't always the case when we go into other Mexican restaurants. I love El Goucho Burro. The salsa bar is fantastic. I like that they bring you a glass bottle (about a liter) of water at the beginning of the meal. My wife is pregnant so we usually go a little early so we don't have to worry about seating but when normal dinner hours role around the place gets pretty packed. Great food - my mouth is watering as I write this.   The could probably splurge to fix their front door. It does slam when people go in and out.",

The tortillas are factory, not freshly made.  The salsa bar has a lot of options, but nothing on the bar stood out as much better than anything you'd find on Baja Fresh's salsa bar.  Service was confusing and wait staff was confused. Transition from counter service to table service after the lunch hour wasn't handled well. I was seated and given a menu but no one took my order, so I ordered and paid at the counter. Then at the end of the meal, other waiters kept asking if I wanted to pay my check.  La Condesa is good enough, but I'm not impressed.",

    "text": "I want to say don't go here... Why? Because my wife and I loved it so much on our first visit to La Condesa that we selfishly want to keep it a secret from others.  The food was really good and such a unique sampling of traditional Mexican food dishes, with a twist.  The mole was to die for and the shark tacos were amazing.  The rice is also so tasty and I am not usually a rice kind of guy.  I always forgo ordering the traditional side of rice & beans and initially I did the same on our visit.  But my wife ordered the rice with her meal and after seeing and tasting hers, I actually added that to my order even though we already had received our food.  Everyone has already mentioned the amazing salsa bar so I won't repeat the accolades other than to say what a journey of amazing and unique concoctions, coupled with a few of the standard salsas.  Have to recommend the cilantro salsa if you go and be prepared to order more chips if you want to take the salsa adventure and try them all!!!  Gets pretty packed during the standard rush hour periods but worth the wait and if you plan accordingly (noon or early dinner meal), you can avoid the surge.  Definitely one of my favorite taco places in Phoenix.  Ray",

I haven't frequented other taco bars in the area so I can't comment on how it stacks up.  However, I think if you are charging higher prices for tacos they should include the rice and beans if you order two, or be packed to the brim with filling.  I must admit I was a bit jealous when my brother got his pibil taco, as this seemed to be one of the more filled-tacos on the menu.  The shark was outstanding and had great flavor.  Seating is at a premium so be careful with larger groups. You may just want to get them togo, sit on the curb outside and have yourself an authentic Mexican experience. I'll definitely visit again next time I'm in the area.  I could see myself pouring that Cilantro salsa on some fries to make for an excellent side dish.",

I had the shark taco and the cochonita pork taco. Excellent! The pork had a strong tangy flavor to it, the pickled onions on top kind of had a strange taste. The shark was beer battered and very tender crispy on the outside. Great tastes on both.   The salsa bar is impressive with done really unique styles of salsa, some even have pecan flavor in them! What?  I also had a Horchata which is a sweet rice milk, you can get it plain or with pecans and fruit, impressive! But if you get the one with the pecans in it don't try to drink it with a straw!  I wish we had a place as great as this where I live, I'd eat there weekly. Lots of creative items.",

It is located in a run down strip mall with limited parking. But once you go through those doors you are transported to a dia de los muertos paradise. Really cool decor with awesome art on the walls. Love the bathroom doors!  Service was warm, informative, and attentive.   Salsa bar. Wow, what can I say? I consider myself an expert on Mexican food, as a Mexican-American myself and a native of Arizona. But I have never seen these sort of salsas in my life! Peanut salsa? Strawberry salsa? Yum.   My husband had the dogfish shark taco dinner and I had the veggie taco dinner. Yummmmm. Hubby loved his tacos and I had the BEST veggie tacos of my life. The cheese in the tacos is delicious. The beans and rice were great too.   I had their house margarita which was so different and refreshing. It had a hint of grapefruit juice which I loved.  My only (very minor) complaints? They charge for chips. Only a couple bucks but I wish I was warned before I saw it on the receipt.   Also, I saw a tiny bit of unidentifiable meat in my taco. It must have gotten mixed in accidentally on the grill. Hey, it happens, but it can really unnerve a vegetarian.  Love this place. We will definitely be back, preferably during happy hour when I can knock back a couple of their margaritas at a discounted price. :)",

    "text": "I came here with friends on a Saturday afternoon during a visit to Phoenix. There's a very authentic vibe to this place. Inside, it's very colorful. Although this place is simple and casual, I was a little surprised at the condition of their menus. They're quite literally falling apart and have holes in them...probably something they should work on replacing. We started off with guacamole and chips (around $10) which was medium sized and delicious. My vegetarian friends ordered burritos which were literally the largest burritos I've ever seen. How does one person eat the whole thing?? Needless to say they were only able to eat half of it. I ordered 3 different tacos ($3.99 each). All three of these were pretty good, but not the best tacos I've had. I thought the tortilla (I think it was corn tortilla?) was pretty thick which I didn't like. The tacos weren't as flavorful as I had hoped. Tacos were also quite filling and I was really full from eating 3 of them. Overall the main thing about this place is that portions are HUGE and you should consider sharing.",

They add cranberries which add a perfect bit of sweetness to counter the slight spicy. I got the street taco combo. I ordered the three options to the right, chilango Suadro,al pastor and chicken asada. They all came with a good amount of meat to taco ratio and all had a different sauce. I could have ate 20 of each! They are the street size so about two/three bites. For my hubs, If he was there, 1.5 bites. However came with side of refried beans and rice with a bit of corn. My entire meal was 8.99. They had a salsa bar which lots of options. Service was nice and extremely friendly. This spot was also on drivers, dived and dine. ( whatever it was called) we had no idea until we got there. Yum",

We all the menu is way to complicated and very fine print so it makes it very hard to choose something. Simply the menu and people will appreciate it. The salsa bar was a hot mess and way to many to choose from which is actually a good thing because more than half had nothing. I was with a party of 5 and after sitting down I was not sure if I wanted to stay after viewing the menu. We are all happy we did as the food was great. We ordered 2 orders of the pacific fish tacos which were awesome, street tacos but don't order the tinga as is was way over seasoned but the asada was bomb, mariachi loco burrito was awesome and kids quesadilla which was good but missing something. Over all very good place to eat and priced correctly except for the plain quesadilla.",

I have never seen a Baby Shark Taco on any menu before and they were the first. My brothers, who are just as adventurous with food as I am, REALLY liked the Baby Shark Taco and the Mincon Taco. Secondly, as a person with Gluten Sensitivities, I know that corn tortillas are safe. But La Santisima took the time to mark everything on their menu that is gluten free. Made my life easy! And the Quesas are gluten free! Lastly, our server was very patient with us (we had a party of 13) and explained to us some of the accolades La Santisima had just received (Best Salsa and Best Horchata). Since we had come from out of town (California), the server took her time explaining the menu (Quesas, Lonches) to us and checked on us frequently. We have all been to Arizona before (Tempe) and hadn't received the best customer service. But La Santisima was great!! Not a bad experience at all!! I am DEFINITELY bookmarking this place so I can come back and try more tacos and indulge in the salsas and 32oz Horchata.",

Even on a Monday at 130, which we thought would be after the lunch rush, we still had about a 20 minute wait. And then when we were seated, we waited another 15ish minutes just for someone to wait on us - no water or drinks in that entire period. However, we made about 3 trips up to the salsa bar, almost just to pass time, but also because he is addicted to the peanut sauce.  But luckily it was all uphill from there. Once our server did come to us, we placed our order right away. I got an orange Margarita (funky, but good) and he got the gigantic horchata, which was sweet, but just not really for me.  I decided on the street taco plate - 1 chicken, 1 carne asada, and 1 chilango, plus rice and beans. My boyfriend got a chicken quesadilla.  For street style tacos, it was definitely a good amount of food. And his quesadilla was gigantic. But oozing with cheese, so we knew it was going to be good.  It was my only meal of the day, but we both finished our plates and didn't have a single regret in the world after that.  It's worth the wait and you get a good amount of food for the price you pay.",

The salsa bar is really cool as well and has a lot of great different salsas you can try!   It took forever to be seated! And there were so many open tables! It took us about 20 minutes to finally get our seat and probably another five for someone to come up to our table. After that, our waitress was pretty attentive until she brought the bill. After that... We waited and waited forever for her to come pick it up so we could pay and leave.  Margaritas were a big bummer too. I originally ordered the grapefruit one as our waitress told us it was fresh squeezed, and it was sooooo sweet! To the point where I couldn't even drink it... almost like artificial sweetener. Our waitress realized that I didn't like it, and asked if she could bring me some limes to hopefully cut some of the sweetness. I took her up on the offer, but unfortunately limes did not help at all. After that, she suggested I replace it with their classic margarita. She brought it to me and took the original one off the bill which was really kind. However, the original margarita wasn't that great either. Definitely didn't have the extreme sweetness, but did not taste fresh and I did not enjoy it. Coming back here, I would definitely just stick to beer.",

    "text": "We are talking about \"one of\" the best Mexican restaurants in Phoenix according to the internet, a city with a huge Hispanic population. With high expectations, La Santisima was the first restaurant I visited after I landed.  Saw some reviews saying that the wait is usually insane, so I went for a late lunch at around 2:30pm, and it was pretty empty. There were still parties leaving and coming. The inside has beautiful art, and great Mexican restaurant vibe. My server handed me the menus and came back shortly for my drinks along with some nachos. There was a whole list of margaritas to choose from, so I asked him to bring me the best seller.   Near the back of the restaurant is a sauce/dip station where you can go customize your own personal dip for nachos according to your preference, or you can get each sauce individually. There were at least 14 different ones to choose from, and I never tried most of them!  Server came back with my margarita, and helped me finalize my main, something that he said he loves as well. That's great, now my expectation is even higher.   The margarita is B O M B. The first sip made me go whoa and my super cool server chuckled. He came over and told me he has made at least 5 of them today!   Food came faster than I expected, in under 10 minutes. It looked massive, could probably feed 2. At that point I was close to drooling and the excitement on my face probably gave it away - my server asked if I wanted a picture with the food!! LOL how awesome is that. Took pictures with the food and I dived in.   First bite and I was in heaven.....  This is what I call perfect Mexican food. The green sauce was perfection, I could literally eat anything with it. Rice and meat were cooked just right, and I ate about a quarter of the food in less than 2 minutes. My server checked up on me while I was in the middle of stuffing my face, and he mentioned that I came on a good day. Usually theres a line up throughout the day.  I was only able to finish half of my food, really want to go back and try the Quesa that my server was raving about!",

They call themselves a gourmet taco shop but I believe they fall short.  I ordered a Cabo shrimp taco, Baja sur dogfish shark taco, and Mayan cochinito pibil. The beer battered shrimp and shark were tasteless and lukewarm. Perhaps some better seasoning would have helped. The service is slower then most places like this, so lunch can be a challenge. The pibil was the only consolation in an otherwise mediocre experience.  The reason to go would be for the art and I hear the Quesa is ok.(Cheese). Not sure I'm heading back anytime soon.

Secondly, they have an unlimited salsa bar with ALL kinds of salsa (everything from traditional salsas like pico de gallo to interesting dips like peanut butter salsa). Thirdly, to top it off, margaritas are $4 all-day everyday...whaaaat?? These deals are almost too good to be True.  My boyfriend and I decided to order and share all five street tacos plus the \"gourmet\" baby shark taco. Each taco packed bold flavors in it - the al pastor was possibly the best spicy pork taco I've had (loved the pineapple bits in the avocado salsa!), the brisket in the chilango suadero was incredibly juicy, and the chicken tinga with pickled onions made a perfect combo. The star of the show though were the shark tacos. The fried fish had a light crispy beer batter, and each bite had delicious, tender, flaky baby shark in it. So good.  The only taco I probably wouldn't order again was the chicken asado. Not that it tasted bad by any means, but after eating all the other tacos, the flavors in this one were rather underwhelming.  Good service and great food. Absolutely will be back next time I'm visiting Phoenix.",

I was not impressed by the way place look.  Floors were dirty with food.  But then I saw waiter cleaning tabla and dumping crumbs on floor.   After we sat down waiter left and didn't come back to take our drink order for a long time.  We almost got up and left because of how long they took to take our orders.  We had the al Pastor mahi fish and mole tacos.  They were super good!! I also had a michelada and it was delicious!! Food wise I give them Five stars.  But service and cleanliness I give them two stars.   Next time I'll give the one in Glendale a chance. Hoping food is as good as here but with better service and a more clean environment.",

I ate dinner at La Santisima on a Thursday. I arrived around five and was seated quickly. I did not receive any service quickly though. The restaurant was clearly understaffed. It took a long time to get a drink, a bowl of chips, and my ultimately my check. It was never clear who my server was either.  The food was excellent, but the service was overwhelmed. I would try La Santisima again, but hopefully the service will be better next time.",

Tried for the first time the strawberry salsa, which I drank like a shooter (yum!) and the jicama salsa was really good, you could eat this like a side salad, nice crunch!!   Jamaica was served in a huge to go cup.. Thumbs up..  Get here early this place has a small dining area and it fills up fast !! Worth the wait though!!",

    "text": "Four stars for the tacos and salsa. Three stars for everything else.   Coming here on a Tuesday night, it was packed. Oddly enough, there was a whole other room that seemed like a \"group table\" room, even though there was room for other people. I got seated fairly quickly since I was solo, but a group of four literally sat at the waiting area the entire time I was dining. I started off with their horchatas. I didnt like the fact that they only serve a 32 oz but I went with what they had. The horchata came off more like water than rice milk. They add alot of fresh fruit, which is great, but is hard to drink with skinny straws. Many of times the straw got clogged. Id recommend packing a boba tea straw. The flavor was mostly cinnamon, lacking a cream flavor.   The chips are nothing special, but that salsa was something special. Not only do they have a wide variety of great flavors, but its all self serve! It was hard not to devour all the chips with that salsa.   Service wise, it was lagging. The waiter didnt bring me water until 20 minutes after I sat down. At the time, i wa swell, hydrated, so I wasnt evem mad about it. I will say that I had to flag down the waiter everytime I needed something.   I ordered the Santisima Taco and the Gaucho Quesidilla. the taco was superb. Great ingredients, great tortilla, and the shrimp was a nice addition! The salsa only made it better. The quesidilla was not exactly what I was expecting. They deep fry the thing, but its more like corn masa than flour. Its not bursting with flavor, but its decent. The ingredients inside of course were really good. the avocado and cheese they had on top of the quesadilla only enhanced the meal.   I would be curious to try their Gaucho as a burrito. i wouldnt mind coming back here again, but I really hope they get better service. I know I wont be ordering that horchata!",

I ordered the 3 Al Pastor street tacos with rice and beans, for my daughter we got the Pollo asada tacos with rice and beans and she sure enjoyed it! Normally she is very picky about onions but she sure enjoyed them from here. They have a large selection of salsas to choose from but there were only a couple that I was fond of, a lot of them seemed to have some weird mixtures but to each their own  I would recommend this place if you're looking for tacos here in Phoenix!",

    "text": "I had this restaurant bookmarked for a while after seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. We were attending a show in Downtown Phoenix, so we went by La Santisima before that. It was around 6-ish in the evening when we arrived and there were only 1 or 2 small tables open, so we were seated immediately. Getting to the table was kind of like walking through a maze since the restaurant is small and crowded.  It was very obvious that they were super busy and there were only 2 people taking orders, delivering food, etc. It took a while for them to take our orders and then even longer to bring us chips to snack on & our drinks. When they did, however, we were more than happy to wait for our food as we were were enjoying all the different salsas with the chips!  The salsa bar they have is very unique. They had very flavorful salsas that I've never had before. My favorite was the peanut one. It was kind of thick and creamy with a bit of spice. Other salsas that both me and my boyfriend liked were the pecan salsa, the salsa roja, the guacamole, etc. There were a total of maybe 10 or 12 different ones, all that tasted great with the chips and also on our tacos. I'd come back here just because of the salsa bar!  As far as our food goes, I ordered the Tinga taco and the Cabo Shrimp taco plate with rice and beans. My boyfriend ordered the La Santisima Speciality tacos with chicken. Both the tacos I ordered were completely different from each other. The Tinga taco tasted good as it was served but I thought that the shrimp taco needed a couple of salsas to enhanced the flavor of the breaded shrimp. The La Santisima Speciality tacos were much like the Tinga taco in that there were a bunch of different toppings on them, so they tasted great as served. My boyfriend couldn't help but to add the delicious salsas on them anyways, however!  Next time, we come in, I'd probably skip both the rice & beans and instead order one more taco! It's not that the rice & beans weren't good, it was just that the tacos were SO GOOD! It's great that everything that can be ordered a la carte or as a meal. Some tacos are bit more expensive than other ones, but the whole menu seemed fairly reasonably priced.  Overall, like I've said, the food was great but the service is where there could be some improvement. We'd recommend this restaurant to others!",

    "text": "All of these years I've been living downtown just down the street from here and I haven't been until today. Everything here is amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Except the service. In their defense, the restaurant does warn you that the dining area has recently expanded and they are relying on a small kitchen. Too bad our food and drinks were out right on time. Our server was hard to find and not very friendly. That's a shame.   Now that we've gotten that bad stuff out of the way let's talk about the fun stuff. First, the salsa bar. Oooo girl. There's something like 15 salsas and sauces here. They're all amazing but I'd recommend the pecan salsa. You do get a free bowl of chips, but it is 2.70 for another one. A little disappointed about that since there's so much salsa to try but that's okay.   Second, dranks! We ordered the blue devil margarita, which was full of fruit and sweetness almost like an amazing marg-sangria hybrid. My table also got a huge michelada and some other regular margaritas. All were absolutely delish.   Last, but not least, those tacos tho!!! There are just too many to list here but out table ordered some of the best looking ones, mahi al pastor, baby shark, tiger shrimp, battered and fried avocado, cauliflower, and Barbacoa. The Barbacoa was certainly the least exotic but my favorite. The tortilla was softly fried and just tooooo good. The vegetarian and vegan choices were numerous if that's your kind of thing. Much appreciated to see a restaurant that serves lots of options for those with dietary restrictions other than just another damn salad!   Get here now because you are missing one of Phoenix's greatest hits!",

This is one of those places! Parking can be dicey at times and first appearance is not an indication to the inside! Once you walk in the door, you notice how clean it is and smell great food! The service is helpful in answering questions. The salsa is great! They have a huge selection of salsa, and even a few I would have never imagined! I have tried probably 3/4 of the salsa flavors and have not been dissappointed yet, which is a huge thing as I love salsa, but it has to be good! Now for the main course- I have tried 90% of their tacos and they are all fantastic! Their burrito's are great too, but pretty hard hitting because they will bring you to uncomfortable full, but soooo good! Great place! Highly recommended!",

The shrimp had a bit too much breading on it for me, the fish was fine, the steak was my favorite. The green chili pork burrito was good but not the best I have had by far. My husband tried the al pastor, carne asada, and steak tacos and enjoyed his but was not overwhelmed. The drinks are decent size but overall the food and drinks are pretty pricey. With so many good Mexican restaurants in Central Phoenix, La Santisma would not be my top choice but it would be a good place to bring an out of town guest looking for some authentic Mexican flavors.",

I just wanted to try them all!   I highly recommend this place. The mahi taco at the bottom of the menu is to die for. The shrimp one with like hibiscus was also good.   We all ordered margaritas and they were fantastic.   Service was slow but very friendly. They expanded and it seems they just don't have the staff to keep up. We weren't bored or in any rush so there wasn't any issue.   I unfortunately won't be spending much more time in phoenix, but when I do, I'll be hanging at this place.",

The variety of salsas at the salsa bar make for a great combination for both tacos and chips. The horchata is also a huge size and very delicious. The fruit added in the horchata makes it a special drink compared to most other horchatas.",

For starters the Paloma drinks were probably the best I have had from any location, the freshness of the fruits mixed with the tequila was tasty! Now the salsa bar was a surprise but a good one with the vast selection of salsas ! The pork burrito was phenomenal, must say the flavor can't describe but the picture I post can speak for itself ! I will be back very soon to try out the tacos !",

    "text": "This is a great little hole-in-the-wall mexican joint. Overall I'd say while service can be a bit iffy, the food is great and reasonably priced.  Chips and salsa is one of my fave foods, and it's complimentary here. The self-serve salsa bar in the back is extensive, with about 8-12 different salsas at a time. I've been here twice and my favorites are their jicama salsa, pico de gallo, and chipotle. I wish the salsa cups were larger, but that's a minor peeve ... and let's face it, I'm not someone who's ashamed to go up to the salsa bar 5 times. (Given the rate at which I inhale chips, I probably need to fit in some excercise laps to the salsa bar anyway.)  On my most recent visit (around 5:30pm on a Thursday) we ordered standard margaritas. I wasn't super impressed with them (and think they were just made from a mix), but when I got the bill and saw they were only $3 each, I wasn't too upset. They did have a proper drink menu, so next time I'm here I may try one of their other cocktails.  Just as a menu tip for if you're debating between tacos, the \"street tacos\" near the bottom of the menu are smaller (~4\") than the \"gourmet\" ones listed at the top (~5\").  I've gotten both kinds and prefer the smaller street tacos, but maybe I'm just biased toward miniature foods. The first time I visited I also ordered rice and beans, which were better than I've had at most places, though I'm not a huge fan of rice & beans in general.  I love mole and they have mole tacos and other mole dishes which I would LOVE to try, but alas thanks to my nut allergy I can't ... I'll have to live vicariously through my fellow Yelpers' reviews & photos on that one!",

Don't come with a party of more than 2 for that's not gonna happen. Dropped a star for the cramp factor  Another star goes for the restrooms.. Let's just say it's best to avoid it all together for there is no coming back once you go in... Now that the negatives are out the door the food was good. By good I mean they have a real unique selection of salsas and the tacos are good too but really the seating takes away from the experience ... For me it did ..

Would have been nice if they replaced the chips on our table - having four of us the first basket didn't last long. I had chicken tacos for my meal, which were also good.

I've had many of the tacos from fish to shrimp to beef to shark and all are good. 2) salsa bar. So many choices! All delicious. Seriously see the pics this is not your average salsa bar. 3) Quesadillas- a unique take on this dish that seriously takes it to the next level. You will not regret ordering any of these!

The salsas were interesting to taste, and helped make this restaurant unique from others that I have tried.  I ordered the tamarind soda, which was nothing special, and honestly just tasted like normal soda. Although the restaurant is well-known for their tacos, I decided to order the Al Pastor burro (burrito) which contained pork, guacamole, pineapple salsa and lettuce.

The shark taco was outstanding, it was not too greasy and topped with cabbage and crema.  The carne asada was some of the best I have had.  It was juicy and seasoned perfectly.  The chicken mole had great flavor and was very rich.  I wasn't too crazy about the cochinita pibil but that is most likely just a matter of taste, nothing was wrong with it.  The salsa bar is very overwhelming with close to one million different selections.    By the way, parking is a nightmare.",

We were the first table in on Sunday and were greeted right away by our server and felt at home with its cozy interior.  It's a small place but has lots of character with the heavy solid wood and wrought iron furniture.  Love the Dia de Los Muertos art and heavy wood bar with cowhide bar stools and authentic Mexican glassware.  We sampled quite a few of the salsas at the salsa bar and there is a little something for everyone including those that can't take a lot of spice.  This is a big plus for us since our family has spice tolerances from 1 to 10+.  What was on our menu? we tried the divorced eggs (which I added avacado), black mole chilaquiles with chicken, and an egg scramble with side of bacon; all of which were served with black beans.... Delicious and full of flavor! I'll have to post the brunch menu next time since it is not currently on their website.  Each of us would order the same thing again, but so want to try the other items of delicousness on their menu.  I guess we will have to make La Condesa a staple on our restaurant list!",

I asked the cashier for a couple extra lids for salsa and she said that \"it's three per order\".  I told her I needed more salsa and if I had to pay so be it.  I really hate when places do that. That kind of thing makes me not want to go back.  Then after that incident, I had ordered to go and while I was waiting this man kept calling the to go order for  \"ranchero burrito\" and I didn't pick it up because I ordered a steak burrito. A few minutes later he asked me what I ordered and when I told him, he said \"that's the order I've been calling!\" How am I supposed to know my order was called a ranchero burrito when the menu doesn't even call it that?!   Service is important to me when I go out to eat, as good as the food was, I probably won't be returning for this reason.",

    "text": "Absolutely delicious.  This small place doesn't have a lot of adequate seating but it has an amazing salsa bar.  Let's get something straight.  A salsa bar consists of more than the standard 3 to 4 salsas.  This place had about 20.  You can tell that some of them were experiments that went well like Peanut salsa and I believe there was a curry salsa.  There were so many.    We ordered the famous baja sur dogfish shark taco, an El Gaucho burrito and an El Gaucho quesadilla.  I am not a big fan of quesadillas because of the flour tortilla and there is usually not a good filling.  This one was deep fried goodness.  Oh man, it was so good that I could only get down half of it.  The filling was steak, cucumber and just hell goodness.  My husband's burrito had majority of the same filing as mine with a little tweaking.  He enjoyed it a lot.  The fish taco was really good as well.  I only had one bite because I was aggressively attacking my quesadilla and fighting off the stares of people watching me enjoy.  With all that being said, customer service is once again an issue.  The small place was pretty packed.  Only one small table was open right by the door.  This table had to be misplacement because who would want to sit by the door and every time someone opens the door, they get smacked in the back of the head?  Our waiter was so non-existent that a waitress would come over to only end up doing the same thing.  Sigh.  The food was so good; I couldn't even dock any points for that.  Be aware that the first bowl of chips is free.  The second bowl is about $2 more.  The chips are good and hot so, I willingly gave over my money for an extra bowl.",

Their happy hour tacos are delicious, especially the tinga tacos. SO GOOD.  Helping ourselves to the fresh salsa bar was a blast. There are so many unique and yummy flavors up there. I think we tried 12 different salsa and absolutely loved four of them. (Not to say that we didn't like the other flavors.)   We then went on to order the the shark, the mahi mahi, the mole and the pibil pork shoulder tacos. I can't say enough about these. The mole was tasty and rich. The pibil pork shoulder was sooooo good. The meat in that one had so much flavor and was just perfect. The shark taco was more like a shark taco with a LARGE side of more delicious shark. Seriously, too much shark for one taco. (Not that such a thing is a bad thing!) The mahi mahi taco was more like a scrumptious mahi mahi pizza. The portions for these tacos are more than enough to keep get you full by the end of the night!  I really liked every little taste that this place offered up. Why isn't this a five star review? Honestly, the service isn't the greatest. It isn't bad service, it just isn't five star service. Seriously, I would over look this little point time and time again if I lived close to this place. The food is AWESOME. Seriously. Check this place out and you will leave full and happy!",

    "text": "OMG! La Condesa, I love you!   If you drive too fast down 16th on your way downtown, you just might miss this little, neighborhood taco joint...and it will be your loss.   La Condesa is a delightful little 10-12 seat restaurant with seating also available at the bar. The wait staff are courteous, helpful and knowlegable about the food. There is a salsa bar with no less than 15 freshly made salsas.. everything from your standard pico de gallo to a strawberry jalapeno and a spicy chipotle peanut. We've been here a few times and have not been disappointed. Try the Sonoran Carne Asada Arrachera steak marinated with Mexican herbs, fresh garlic & olive oil, charbroiled with mesquite charcoal or the Mayan Cochinita Roasted Pork Shoulder Taco with marinated onions and salsa habanera. If you order the \"taco plate\" for a few dollars more, you can get sides of their slow cooked beans and rice.  This is a place nice enough to take your mom and trendy (and inexpensive) enough to take your out of town hipster friends.   Total neighborhood foodie heaven on a budget.",

I'm happy to report that the tacos here are about as authentic as one can hope to find north of the border.  The Horchatas are fun and tasty as well.  I enjoyed the food and the small dank dining space brought back memories of the small eateries way down south.  So why only 3 stars?  The price is not right.  For a family of four (with two kids), we walked out with a bill of $55.  All we ordered was one round of tacos and some Horchatas.  Ouch.  Down in the DF, one can find better quality and quantity at a full-service sit down restaurant for 1/3 that price.  Maybe I'm looking for something that doesn't exist in Phoenix and I should just be happy to have this food at any price (or perhaps I just paid the \"Guy Fieri tax\").  No... I'll keep searching.",

The serving cups are too small so as to adequately support the dipping of the chip. Speaking of which, the chips are too thin and cold.   The food itself is good quality. The shark taco was crunchy and tasty, the pork shoulder taco interesting and flavorful. Sadly neither was worth the 4 buck price.",

CONS: The place is very small and definitely gets crowded because the food is so good. When it is busy, the staff have a hard time keeping up so service can be slow and you may even feel like you are being ignored. Parking is the worst.

On the first night in Phoenix, my friend and I drove here for dinner at 8 PM. Neighbourhood is very quite/rundown/sketchy. However, the restaurant was fully packed. Just when we entered through the door, everyone looked at us. May be this is what people in Phoenix do. It felt a little weird as if we were crashing someone's party. We were seated at a table just emptied by someone else. That table was not very clean.  We got a basket of chips and started getting salsas. I was in salsa heaven. I like spicy food. This place serves it very well. We ended up ordering their La Santisima burritos and quesos. Another order of chips. Decided to come back again before we go back from Phoenix. I liked the burrito better than the queso.  I don't want to spend more time in Phoenix. However, this will be go to spot for one meal when I am there. Definitely worth the wait and experience.

    "text": "For our Sunday lunch we were in the mood for some truly authentic tacos and thought we'd give this place a try.  Location & Aesthetics - located on N 16th Street in Phoenix which I noticed can be a little busy with traffic even though it was Sunday. Parking is a little poor (-1) with a few stalls located outside the restaurant, and some of these parking spots are shared with another business on the corner.   I did notice some other available parking in the vicinity but believed they were for other businesses. Unfortunately N 16th Street was busy, at the time of our visit, so you can't really stop alongside the parking spots to wait for someone to leave as that might cause some traffic on the busy street.  Thankfully there's a side street on the right that you can turn into to turn around. The facade of the restaurant cannot be missed with its brightly green colored painting and large saint figure adorning the front of the restaurant.   Another drawback the restaurant had going for it, in my opinion, is the small interior size (-1).   As soon as you open the door, you will immediately notice how small it is as you will see diners siting at their tables right at the door as you enter.  I can see this could be a little bothersome if you've been seated close to the front door, and with it opening and closing, doesn't bode well for a nice dining experience for some. There is a bench outside of the restaurant for you to wait for seating if the inside is full, and with no real shade and I didn't see any misters, that can be uncomfortable, I guess, during the summer months.  Menus - provided to us as soon as we were shown where to sit and were pretty self-explanatory.     Service - We were warmly greeted by staff upon entering.  It might've been nice if we were asked if we've been here before but no problem as any questions we had, was answered promptly.  Food - Once seated, you are provided with a bowl of tortilla chips, and there's an available salsa bar with a large variety of salsa dips to choose from.  The dips all sit on ice being chilled and have varying degrees of hotness.  From the 5-6 dips that I chose from, they all tasted freshly made and was enough to open the appetite. Prior to ordering, I was in the mood for some libations and ordered myself a mojito which in my opinion was perfectly concocted as you could taste the lime juice (tasted fresh), rum, right amount of sugar, and contained enough leaves of mint. For food, I ordered the -- Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco, Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, and the Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Shark Taco with a side of rice and beans.   All three tacos tasted absolutely great and delicious.  There were all flavorful, seasoned well, fresh, not too spicy, and cooked just right.  Definitely a place I wouldn't mind returning to.",

Every meal that was brought out, I wanted to try!!   For my meal, I stuck with all tacos and tried the Carne Asada, Al Pastor and the Baha Fish Taco. They were all so flavorful with their own distinct tastes. All the salsas were different and I believe we tried all of them. They do have a pretty full bar so if you are in the mood, you can try it out. Many people were ordering the Horchata which I made the mistake of not ordering, so this will on Round #2's menu. I did stick with a Mexican Coke and it hit the spot!  I was very intrigued by the artwork, it made me feel like I was somewhere else outside of Phoenix. As I said, I cannot wait to return :)",

I opted for the brisket taco, carne taco and pollo. (Chicken) All three were great. They give you the standard chips when you sit down to snack on. Nice thing is there is a salsa bar too!!! Our server was great, smile from ear to ear. I definitely recommend giving them a try. You will not be disappointed!!! Oh, and look for the famous guy on the wall!!!",

    "text": "I sure would love to give this place 5 stars. I promise myself Im coming back so perhaps you may see an update.  I have been hearing about this place even before I saw it on Triple D and I am not quite sure why yesterday was my first visit, I will tell you it wont be my last.  The menu is massive and somewhat confusing it's very wordy with such authenticity that it was just overwhelming. But it is primarily composed of appetizers, Lonchas, (sandwiches) Tacos, Burritos, and quesadillas. thousands of words filled that menu of 100 choices. I snagged a paper menu on my way out and will be ready next time.  Once sat we were greeted with a welcome, and some chips and directed to the salsa bar. Now The salsa bar has a reputation, and I feel it didnt live up to the hype. 4 of the 10 bowls were empty and it wasn't neat and fresh looking. I did try many of what was available  and they were great, if not super spicy!!!!! Strawberry salsa was a stretch but it wasn't bad, and the pico was good, just a basic pico, chipotle was tasty and there was another that was pureed and very hot that's was my favorite. The creamy cilantro could be epic, but some one thinned it out to the consistency of milk, if it was more of a creama I would still be there.  I ordered a burrito because I couldn't comprehend all of the taco choices, upgrades and extra charges for this and that. Tacos range from 4 to 10 dollars ea ala-cart. My choice of the Norteno with green chili was a hit. so very good with a great combo of moist roasted pork, rice, chile, sour cream and cheese. I didn't opt for the enchilada style $5 upgrade because I am fussy about enchilada sauce. I realize now I could have trusted this kitchen. I was a bit surprised to find my plate unadorned with anything but a fair size burro cut in 2. after a few bites all was forgiven.  My buddy loved his street tacos I tasted his beans they were amazing but the rice! The Rice was simply perfection, served on the side and just a little off white. There was something in that recipe caused those flavors to soar!!!! Most Cravable menu item.  It's a cool dining room with lots of quality art covering all of the wall space, along the walls were long naugahyde covered banquettes and loud chairs that sqauwked if you moved the feet across the floor. Felt pads are greatly needed for the chairs.  Restrooms were a mess and poorly stocked, and I could go on and on about that but it doesn't seem to do much good, owners and managers just don't seem to care about them any more, and that was the missing star in this review.",

Unfortunately terrible employer whom the owner doesn't want to pay for my days worked, just putting the word out hoping he will pay im not asking for extras im only asking for what is fair and that is the hours I worked and the tips i recieved from all the generous customers, Christmas is just around the corner and im really hoping to get my full paycheck so i can buy my kids some gifts. I have reported him to the Department of Labor,I also posted on FB which to my surprise several people have come out to say the owner Felipe owes them hours worked as well. I hope the owner realizes what he's doing is wrong and touches his heart to pay me what is fair. Like i said in the beginning food is great and i do recommend it, just not as an employer.",

Small intimate restaurant kind of off the beaten path. My friend took me here and she loves the tacos. Next time I'm back I'll have to try them- but my burrito was so good I will probably just get it again.  Salsas GALORE at the salsa bar.

During our last dinner, we were lucky to get one refill and at no point did the waitress check on us after the food was delivered. I actually had to leave the table and go looking for her so we can get the check. The kitchen as always is very slow, so plan on waiting for at least 30 min, even if your order is a simple burrito. The guac is very good for the first few bites, but then you discover that the bottom half of your $10 guac is nothing but onions and tomatoes.  So I am paying $10 for a few slivers of cut up avocado and the rest is the free salsa that's sitting on the salsa bar?  Again food is excellent, but they really need to make sure that the rest of the place comes together.  I am willing to drive out here and search for parking, but more visits with bad service and I will not be coming back.",

SO GLAD WE DID.  5 of us showed up for some Gourmet Taco's.  A bit of a wait - but not bad.  Not a lot of room to sit/wait inside - and it could be a hot wait on the sidewalk out front on a summer day - but - once we were inside and seated...Happiness ensued.  A pretty comprehensive menu - various taco preparations - from a traditional Barbacoa (Mariachi), Chicken Tinga, a Sonoran Arrachera steak, to my choice - the Sonora Carne Asada Burro.  Wonderful!  Very flavorful, tender and moist meat.  My dining companions had a variety of taco's and quesadillas, and everyone was completely satisfied.  Lots of wow's every time someone tried something new.  The salsa bar was great - only complaint - I like to really dip my chips, and the small cups provided just enough room to put the tip in, and just enough for a taste.  They were all very tasty - some much more hot than others.  Loved the sweet/slightly hot fresh mango salsa.  I could eat just a bowl of that and be happy!  Too full for deserts.  Well be back again for sure!  Enjoy!",

I also particularly liked the texture of the tortillas used to wrap the creative goodness of the tacos. My wife and I also shared the poblano queso.

From strawberry to peanut butter to mango, that really was the highlight of our visit.  I recommend this place to all Mexican food lovers.",

However, the service, as always, was awful. Our server didn't do a bad job, but the host was horrific. It was like she had never been in a restaurant before. There was a wait and she never took anybody's name down and didn't quote any wait times. We walked in, noted a couple groups waiting, and the host looked at us and said \"we don't have any tables\" ... ... Yeah no kidding. We know. My wife made a face and said \"... yeah... we'll wait..?\" Awful, unorganized mess. They obviously didn't train this host whatsoever.  Once we got sat, our server took over, did a good job, and the food was great.",

We have been coming here when it was small and I mean small. When there was actually seats at the bar. Now they have expanded and the place is always packed.  You will fall in love with all the salsa they make homemade... there is such an arrangement and you really can't go wrong with any you choose.  I normally get a beer here, but the last time I grabbed a margarita and for me not being a sweet drink guy, this wasn't at all and was extremely good... especially for the price!  The artwork is also really amazing... overall great service (always) and amazing food. Highly recommend a stop!",

The chicken was okay.  Some will like it but it did not appeal to me.  The rice and beans were good.  They brought chips out.  We enjoyed the salsa bar too.  I liked the chipotle sauce the best.  The flavours were great.    Next time we come back I will try a couple of other things on the menu.  I might go with a burrito next time.   Great place if you are looking for something unique.

The horchata was INSANELY good, it had fruits and pecan, which I never knew I needed in my horchata but now will want it served that way. We had the baby shark taco - it was unlike any taco I've had before - to inform you shark tastes like if fish and chicken had a baby.  Their quesadilla is not the \"traditional\" quesadilla and instead was a fried oogy gooey amazingness with Oaxaca cheese which is basically Mexican mozzarella. Did I mention the huge salsa bar? You can try all kinds of tasty salsas and other sauces. Be careful though if you're not a spicy person, read the name thoroughly so you don't accidentally inhale what seemed like normal salsa and the heat sneaks up.  If you're in the city you HAVE to try this place, we were here for a week eating Mexican food everyday and this was our favorite by far.",

The pico is always my favorite because it's so fresh and usually has a kick from the jalapeno which I love- but I usually get a small side of every single thing from the salsa bar! Yummmmm! (By seriously, make sure you get the pico)   I ordered the street taco plate with rice and beans. I tried the chilango suardero, chicken asado and carne arrachero. My favorite was probably the chilango suardero and my least favorite was the carne arrachero (mostly because it had a strong chipotle taste which I didn't care for). The chicken was really good too!! If you like a lot of flavor then def go with the chilango! Although I may be biased because I poured mounds of salsa and pico all over my tacos!   The rice and beans were good too, but I was sooooo full from the tacos that I didn't eat more than a bite.",

I  finally chose to chicken taco combo, it was nothing to right home about, they were rather bland even with lime and cabbage. The rice and beans were flavorless. There was a salsa bar with several different salsas, all with different ingredients, it was like  they were trying to hard, none of them were not really to my liking, i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for real street tacos.

Take a peak at the average rating over the past few months, and you will see I am not alone.    Tip to diners:  make sure you sit in the main dining room, away from the entry / bar.

We got a horchata to share. All together this would set you back about $40.00-$45.00 before tip. I consider it a little steep considering the sides were pretty much refried beans and a clump of rice (a colorless platter lacking guac, lettuce, and sour cream). But I'll have to admit that the burro was large and delicious. Taste was on par with a top ranked authentic Mexican restaurant that I used to frequent before I moved to Phoenix. They give you tortilla chips when you first sit down and there is a bar of various salsas in the back corner. I like how the waitresses make sure you are taken care of, but are not intrusive by checking on you too often. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting because the food truly is delicious.",

To me, it is a bit too expensive to feel like the tables are grimy. Don't get me wrong, I love grubby places but this just didnt have the right combo. It needs a deep clean.  The tacos were ok, and the beans and rice were very very very tasty!  Again, the staff was absolutely charming and I did enjoy myself. But personally I probably wouldnt return.

Since it was a new place for me I decided to order several items so that I could try different flavors. To begin, I ordered the shrimp queso which had a nice, smooth taste to it. I loved it. For my main course I ordered 4 different tacos and the very first thing my eyes saw on the plate were a long piece of hair! Yuckkk! I got up and went to look for the waitress, the manager, someone I could talk to about this and everyone seemed so busy so I went to the register and told the cashier what I had discovered. At that point, she called the manager over and he apologized and asked if he could get me a new set of tacos but I advised him that I was too grossed out to keep eating. I asked for my check which they ended up charging me for the queso and my drink and I left, adding this restaurant to my \"never return\" list. Sorry but it is what it is and your cooks and even waitresses should be more attentive.",

    "text": "This restaurant is schizophrenic.  The front of the house is a nightmare: incredibly slow, somewhat aloof service, small plastic cups of water that don't get refilled, restroom issues (the men's was closed and the women's was dirty which is unacceptable at all public establishments but especially in a restaurant).  When we sat down there were chips on the table but no napkins; those didn't arrive until dinner so I went into the restroom and grabbed some paper towels.  Speaking of salsa, the restaurant has a salsa bar with at least a dozen different types to choose from -- great idea in theory, but unfortunately about half of the containers were empty and they were not refilled the entire time we were there.    However...I gave this place 3 stars because the food is indeed delicious.  My husband and I ended up ordering the same thing -- a \"street taco\" plate with 3 different tacos, rice, and beans.  The al pastor, chicken mole, and pork pibil tacos are fabulous, with complex flavors that explode in your mouth. The food is high quality, fresh, and incredibly tasty. I would have liked to tell you about the guacamole, but at 8:00 p.m. they were out of it.  We noticed that they offer take out service and I would recommend that as the sole way to get food from La Santisima.  In addition to the lousy, indifferent service the restaurant is tiny, crowded, and doesn't have much atmosphere.  They really should expand to a larger space where they can better meet the demand that's been generated from all the favorable press and their admittedly delicious Mexican fare.",

Anyway, The BF and I both got taco plates. I got the pork and the gaucho tacos. The pork was alright, very tender and the flavor was decent - a little sweet a little spicy, but the gaucho was pretty not good. There was something incredibly sweet about it...I did not like it at all, and I love chimichurri sauce. Their salsa bar is fabulous! I liked the pecan salsa and the tomatillo. I thought the strawberry salsa was odd...not my cup of tea. The salsa was the best part of the meal. I also had the horchata.....I did not care for it. The fruit and nuts in it did not add to the flavor and it was served luke warm...not so good. I do not know that I would go back.",

    "text": "Of the countless Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, it's hard to find one with an authenticity to it that brings back memories of Mexico City. Fortunately, La Condesa, an excellent taco shop in an unlikely location, succeeds. The first time I went there, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, as I had been recommended numerous times by family members and friends.   What I noticed immediately was the eclectic selection of homemade salsas. From smoky peanut sauce to deliciously sweet avocado salsa, Condesa has just about everything a chips & salsa lover could imagine. As for the chips themselves, they're actually warm and delicious even when not dipped in one of the many salsas offered. Condesa makes you believe that the chips are being made in the kitchen right before they bring them to your table, even if this isn't the case.  The restaurant's atmosphere perfectly matches the food, with excellent music playing at all times and fascinating art adorning every wall of the room. Based mostly off of classic Mexican art and architecture, La Condesa is beautiful to look at it if you decide to dine alone. Even if you are with friends or family, the many art pieces hung around the room will surely spark a conversation; they're all gorgeous and full of Mexican history.  For the main course, I had a Veggie Burrito with a side of rice and refried beans. Just about everything was absolutely delicious, and pouring a little bit of salsa on it made it even tastier. The beans weren't very full of flavor but were definitely enjoyable especially when eaten with the rice and burrito.   Since my first visit, I've tried a variety of foods at Condesa but my favorite so far has to be the Shark Meat Burrito. Before trying it there I had never eaten shark meat before and always wondered what it could taste like. To my surprise, it was actually delicious and made for the perfect filling to an already delicious burrito filled with mushrooms, spinach, melted cheese, and garlic.  To drink I only had a pink lemonade, but the person I came with had Condesa's famous Horchata. While I'm used to the delicious and legendary Horchata from Mexico, I did enjoy the Horchata at Condesa, even if it wasn't as perfect as some of the more authentic renditions that I've tried over the past couple of years.   The fountain drinks are served in large cups, the kinds that you see in gas stations directly off the freeway, complete with a plastic lid and straw. Of course, the presentation wasn't anything fancy, but the cup is so large that needing a refill is unlikely, something I enjoyed (especially when the place is extremely busy, making it near impossible to get speedy service).  This brings me to my final, and only entirely negative, point. Where Condesa is lacking is in the service. While all the servers are very nice and accommodating, the food has a tendency to take a while to get to the table, especially if the restaurant is busy. With room for about 20 or 30 people at the very most, Condesa is a small restaurant, one that operates with a maximum wait staff of about three at all times.   The best advice I can give you is to take your trip to Condesa before the lunch rush, or before the dinner rush. The enjoyable experience of the food and atmosphere will be quickly deflated once the restaurant reaches 65% capacity or more. The tables are far too close together and eavesdropping on another group's dinner conversation is entirely unavoidable. It's best to not come with massive groups, as the restaurant prides itself on its intimacy.   Anyone looking to try authentic Mexican food should come to Condesa immediately. While I'm one to enjoy places like Filiberto's almost any day of the week, the experience you'll have at Condesa is one that few other restaurants in Phoenix can offer. The prices aren't extremely high, and the food is worth every penny.",

I'd recommend the peanut salsa to anyone. It was some seriously good sauce.",

The abundance of flies in the restaurant made it difficult for me to enjoy my meal to the fullest.  It also made it hard for me to concentrate on the otherwise stimulating conversation I was having.  I had to swat flies the entire time.  Maybe it is because they leave the front door wide open?  The flies can't resist such delicious food?  I'm no snob and the food really was good.

This makes it hard to take our kids here, as they find it hard to wait for their food that long.  We go here a lot, because the food is amazing, but that is the only reason.  If they had the service aspect of dining, it would be one of the best restaurants in the state.",

    "text": "Great place, if you're looking for excellent unique Mexican food rather than the plain old run of the mill rice and beans being served every half mile in Phoenix. My wife and I love new and unique, we had one look at their salsa bar (all made from scratch) and had to try them all. The tortillas alone are fantastic, but then filled with shredded chicken, mole, shrimp, roasted peppers, fried cheese, cochinita, all blended with traditional spices and cook to delicious Mexican perfection and add to that the accompaniment of ALL THOSE SALSAS! The decor is beautiful, it has a very rustic cantina feel to it, with some amazing artwork on the walls. Over all the only disappointing thing is that we didn't discover this place sooner.",

    "text": "This place was amazing! The only downfalls would be the parking situation and the service is freaking SLOW. We came on a Saturday a little before 5:30 pm and a 10 minute wait. We ordered 2 margaritas as soon as we sat down and didn't get them until maybe 30 minutes later after flagging our waitress down. Pretty sure she forgot, but still c*mon. They were pretty dang good too. I love the complimentary salsa bar and the variety of flavors! Salsas definitely can make or break the meal and you have so many to choose from! The chips were fresh and tasty. 1st basket is complimentary but I think like $3 for more as it states on the menu. The fried fish taco was fabulous, light and crispy! The refried beans were creamy and smooth. Rice was simple, so it was a refreshing change from other restaurants. The whole dining experience  took 2 hours! So it's definitely a place you need to go to when you have the time to spend. We had time to look at the menu and decide what we were getting before we sat down, so we weren't taking our sweet time or anything.  The line was out the door at 6 pm and the service is on the slower side, do be ready for the wait. However, I was impressed with the food and will definitely be back!",

Our waitress graciously explained that this was a tamarindo in my drink, which gave the margarita flavor. I have been driving past this restaurant for years, admiring the beautiful sugar skull mosaic glistening in the Phoenix sun as I drove by.  Well tonight was the night. I pulled into one of the limited parking spaces located directly on 16th street, momentarily pondering how I will pull out later, but consumed with curiosity as to what was behind the big wooden door. I apprehensively opened the door, and was pleasantly surprised with what I found. A quaint mom and pop restaurant with a True southwest feel and experience. With the likes of a visit from Guy Ferari (?) And Best of New Times awards plastered on the menu, I was feeling pretty proud of my mystery choice.  My sister and I ordered and split the bean and Oaxaan cheese burro, mole chicken taco, an the al pastor tacos.  All were excelente!! Ok, thats enough for now as I am feeling the nice mellow effects of my magnefico tamarindo slowly wear off.  We will be back!!",

The waitress was the only one, so I was forgiving when it took her a while to take our drink order. At least the bus boy had given us water. By the time she came around we were ready to order as well. It didn't take too long before our order was out but it was missing a few things. My boyfriend had asked for his burrito enchilada style and it was not. He was also missing the rice he ordered. Since we had never been there before I ordered 4 different tacos to see which one I liked the most. Our waitress only brought 3. We told her our issues and she went to fix them right away. I was almost done before my boyfriend's burrito came back with sauce. When she finally brought the 4th taco it was the wrong one. By then I gave up and just took what she had given me. I was just super disappointed that the service didn't match the food. Hopefully next time will be better.",

It isn't cheap by any means, but the salsa bar has so many choices (delicious each one) that more than makes up for the slightly higher cost.  And the choices don't just range from pico de gallo to hot to hotter.  Some are tart, some are creamy, some are smoky and hit the back of your throat, some are hot on the front end, etc.  Just go and taste it for yourself  Because I live close by, I prefer to take my tacos home because the space is very small and (because the food is so good) it can get quite cramped in no time.  (And when the unfortunate circumstance of someone bringing in a baby happens, there really isn't any way to pretend you aren't in hell no matter how much Yoda you think you can channel.)  But get there early and down a few of their happy hour margaritas you might not care about the space.    If anyone knows of another place with a salsa bar even half as good as La Condesa's, please let me know.",

We had a 30 min wait, but it was so well worth it, the food was amazing!!.. the owner was very kind and started us on drinks while we waited for a table.  The staff is very courteous, the food is phenomenal.. the price is a little up there, but then again it's not your local Taco shop, this is definitely gourmet tacos at it's best.  I loved their Shrimp tacos!! and of course their cochinita pibil quezadillas were lickity good.. everything on the menu looks very very good.",

While the salsa selection is incredible, I was encouraged to order an Aztec Tinga Taco. While I enjoy slathering salsa on virtually any Mexican food offering, I found that the Aztec Tinga Taco was so perfectly seasoned that it require no additional seasoning. Perfect.

    "text": "I came here because my coworkers were all talking about how good this place was. I also heard that they had shark tacos that my bf really wanted to try. The place is super small and kind of divey. They have a salsa bar for you to enjoy when you first sit down. The strawberry salsa was my favorite. Sweet but a little bit spicy. They definitely get you on the chips though because there are no free refills like most other places. Another basket of chips is almost $3. I got the chicken mole quesadilla. Their quesadillas are definitely not like your typical quesadilla. It's almost like a deep fried calzone. The portion is huge though, I could only eat half of it. My bf got one shark taco to try and it was kind of disappointing. It tasted like cod and there wasn't very much flavoring. The taco just came with a tiny bit of lettuce and some green sauce. We got the guacamole and it was delicious. They put raisins and some other fruit in it. At first it sounds strange but trust me, it's so good. Wish we saved some chips to eat with it since we ate most of it with the salsa. The service is friendly and the food came out pretty quick. I'm glad we tried it out but don't know if I would be dying to go back.",

Having been a server for 3 years, I'm very understanding and knowledgeable about the difficulties and disasters that can occur while serving. My experience at La Santisima was severely impacted by the understaffing. There was one woman on the floor and one bartender. Their roles included greeting guests, seating guests, getting water/drinks, making drinks, running food, taking orders, bussing tables, resetting tables, taking to go orders, packing up to go orders, and checking people out. I came the day after Christmas at 2pm, and every seat out of the 40 seats available at this restaurant were occupied. Not only is this impossible for two people to manage this type of volume on their own, but guest service several suffers because of it. My sister and I opted to just order to go, rather than sitting and adding another table to their load. After we ordered, We were directed to the extensive salsa bar, which would have been awesome, if half the salsa containers weren't already empty. I mean who has time to restock the salsa bar with sooooooo many other tasks to do, but as a guest it's disappointing.  The food we got to go was great! Hopefully they can get some more staff to make the whole experience more enjoyable for the guest and less stressful for those currently employed.",

The place is a little hard to find if it's your first time so after multiple turn arounds and a stop at the Panaderia to ask for directions my colleague and I arrived at taco bliss.   The meal starts off with an endless bowl of fresh tortilla chips and a salsa bar that would make Bobby Flay  jealous. They had some of the best homemade salsas with a large variety. From your classic Pico De Gallo to a Creamy Cilantro salsa.   I ordered the two taco platter with a tinga taco and a carne asada Taco. These were both great. The carne asada was a little dry for my taste but with the assist of the homemade salsa's it was a perfect combo. The tinga taco was a perfect combination of slowly cooked shredded chicken and seasoning. My colleague got a carne asada burrito and a tinga taco and was satisfied by both.   In short if I am looking for a great taco for a good price I am going back to La Condesa.",

All of them tasty); and their thick-rolled, flavorful quesas.  In the land of a thousand Mexican restaurants, they bring a fresh spin to the cuisine and the food is awesome.

I had previously only eaten the cochinita taco which is good, but not out of this world. From now on everything I eat at this place will be in \"quesa\" form...   This was unlike any quesadilla I've ever had. The tortilla was thick and crunchy and soft all at the same time and had a taste of sweetness to it. Oh man, Delicioso! The chicken tinga was a perfect compliment as well.   The salsa bar is kind of BS, as there are only a couple of salsas worth your time. The peanut salsa? Give me a break, terrible! But the mexicana salsa is one of the greatest things ever.   This is a \"fine dining\" type Mexican place that will knock your socks off and run you about 10 bucks. Check it out if you're in the area, it is definitely worth your time!",

I ordered One Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco as my Appetizer which was lightly battered and fried perfecty in obviously clean oil.    My Entree was the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken Quesa.  The 2 Quesas were crispy, pastry like and filled with Mole Chicken.  Oaxaca cheese was sprinkled on top and was a nice compliment .

We went in for lunch, and it all went wrong on so many levels.  1. It took them almost 20 minutes to get us chips and drinks. 2. It took another 20 to get our order. 3. Then just as our food was coming out, they had the audacity to ask us to MOVE TO ANOTHER TABLE AS OUR FOOD CAME OUT! 4. We had the Lonches, and the bread was so stale that you couldn't eat it.  I have never, ever had this happen anywhere in the world. Its considered sacrosanct in the world of food service that once a customer is seated, barring an emergency, that you don't move the patrons. Yet, a group of 8 land roving manatees with bad prison tattoos garnered enough respect in this place to get the manager to force us to move.  Now if you do fuck up this badly during a service, you comp the meal and you apologize. This is scripture when it comes to food service, and you don't defy this logic.  Yet, no apology, no offer to make it right, no nada.  I will never go back to La Condesa. We've been eating here loyally for two years, bringing in others to eat there, going out of our way to vouch for this place. Things have changed, and not for the better.   I suggest you skip this place at all costs. Just not worth the BS and rude treatment to even risk it.",

I hate our society now that this is acceptable behavior of bringing your crying baby to restaurants ...how about taking that kid outside for a stroll like a responsible adult than totally ignore them and put us through this stressful situation (you're just waiting for me to snap RIGHT?)  Well back to the review... Food was fresh, unique, authentic. Plus, Plus, Plus. Salsa's were plenty, yes tried them all. But I'm a foodie and I need flavor, though I thought it's a bit on the bland side for my taste, I'll instead rave about them being unique and not your 'ordinary' mex-restaurant. The night we went, there was a line and busy, and they do treat you as family/friends (another Plus) but maybe too crowded. We had the center table and everyone, servers and patrons jammed right in there.  I ordered up the Sonora Carne Asada Burrito (it says: A char-broiled mesquite Arrachera steak with homemade beans) unsure what Arrachera Steak is but gobbled it up with extra salsa from the buffet. Jodi had the Fish Tacos and well... they smelled fishy. Not the best either one of us ever had ...but was now check off our bucket list. Mission complete",

We had an hour since it was on my husbands lunch break, and decided on this place because I was craving some \"street tacos\", and the reviews/pictures looked awesome.... oh how I was wrong!!  Seems easier to number all the issues we had!  1. We walk in at 12:10 to a nearly empty restaurant, I first try to use the bathroom, and the light wasn't working... that should have been my first clue.  2. We sit down and a few minutes later the place is packed, but for some reason everyone has been help except us!?!  3. Finally someone comes to help, I ordered the horchata since it was mentioned so frequently in the reviews, my husband ordered a Sierra Mist (remember it came in a to-go cup with a lid)  The horchata was bizarra, and $4 4. My 2 year old daughter grabs the free chips.. and I see MOLD on it, then realize the whole basket is full of moldy chips!! No wonder they are free! 5. A different waiter finally shows up since the other waitress was busy taking care of the customers that came AFTER us... I ordered the Sonora Arrachera Taco, and told them about the MOLDY chips, he apologized and took the chips away.  The original waitress came back, apologized for the chips, and said she would comp the drinks, I returned the horchata, and got a Sierra Mist as well (also came in a to-go cup, there's a reason I am mentioning this) 6. After 20 min and being there for 40 and food had not arrived I asked for it to-go. about 5 min later it came along with the bill that only included the food.  By this point I was annoyed but probably wouldn't have given it 1 star, so we leave with to-go cups in hand along with food. I dropped my husband off at work, then drove home. When I got home I ate 1 taco which was pretty good, the meat was flavorful and tender, I only wished I had some of that salsa to add to it. Then I got a text from my husband.....  7. My husband asks \"is your Sierra Mist BROWN??? I  open the lid and sure enough it looks like dirty water!!!  Seconds later the entire meal... is in the trash! VOMIT!   I gave this place more chances then I ever give a place. WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!",

I disagreed, but that evening, I just so happened to bike over to La Condesa to try out this new gourmet taco place on 16th.  The cursive red neon sign, that word \"gourmet\" and the dozens of Yelp endorsements ushered us in on a Tuesday night.  Warm walls. Original paintings. Furnishings from Bellas Artes de Mexico.  The most substantial wooden tables and chairs in central Phoenix.  When we had opportunity in our conversation to \"knock on wood,\" we felt a bit shamed by the feebleness of our gesture and the robustness of the table.  Order at the counter from a cheerful and demure young lady, whose accent we could not place.  I linger on the ambiance because others have noted the stellar food.  Your food food for thought:  Come for the two taco meal (with beans & rice (with corn!)), and stay for the fresh and diverse salsa bar.  This isn't Baja Fresh.  This is Condesa cuisine.  Think jicama and orange salsa.  Think peanut salsa. And the creamiest, zingiest cilantro creme salsa!  I must disagree with Lali about the beans: America's Tacos' are more memorable, but you are still right, Lali, on a technicality -- the beans at America's are not pinto...It's a secret. Not really. Ask them.",

I went with a vegan and even they found something to eat that was reaaaaally good (vegetable burrito). Some of the salsas were really spicy, but all of them were awesome. Decor is great (chairs are a little heavy and make a crapton of noise if you move them, but I don't really think that's a dealbreaker, come on now), and yes, it's in a bad area (really guys, let's keep posting about locking our cars. Shouldn't you do that everywhere anyway? Most of the people I know who have had their cars stolen had them stolen from outside their houses, or at work, in BETTER neighborhoods than this. Get. Over. It), but overall it was fantastic, servers were attentive and very nice, and the food was YUM and at a good price.",

An extensive salsa bar with many clever flavors, many more than most places. Cilantro lime cream sauce, pecan salsa, seven pepper salsa... etc. You get the picture. This place deserves all the hype. Really nice service, very original ideas and flavors like you will taste no where else. Go check this place out for yourself. I personally will now be a regular here.",

    "text": "It is interesting that the bust of a tattooed woman above this restaurant specializing in tacos should have such a strong Aztec feel to it since, according to Wikipedia the Spanish conquistadors were the first Europeans to enjoy tacos and incidentally wiped out the Aztecs. I guess that means cultures may come and go but tacos, they are forever, and thank goodness because this place, one heck of an bargain for such a great foodie experience.  The restaurant, if you don't know what you are looking for, can be easy to drive past so have you smartphone out with the map function on Yelp to make sure you don't miss it. Once I arrived, as it was just me, I sat at the bar instead of taking up a whole table. After ordering my drink, which comes in a take-out cup (and I ordered iced-tea, not the famous Horchata which seems well worth trying) you get a basket of tips and then you can go hit the salsa bar which has at least a dozen different types of salsa. I was partial to the peanut salsa, sort of feels like a Thai/Mexico crossover though the pecan salsa, which creamy, was somewhat bland.  I did especially like the 7 pepper salsa, a mix of roasted green peppers, slivers of garlic and olive oil, from what I could tell and their more traditional red salsas seemed quite good.  I had the two taco special, which is about $10 and comes with a small side order of rice (fluffy white rice with corn in it, nothing special) and a small container of re-fried pinto beans, also nothing special but they look nice on the taco plate. For the two tacos I ordered, and this is a mouthful, the \"Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco\" and some sort of grilled steak taco..both came made with two corn tortillas instead of one and the nice thing, they were not overly soft but had a dry feel to them that kept them from getting soggy from any juices from the taco fillings.  The grilled steak taco had some sort of lime based topping that was really good and both tacos were quite substantive. The Cochinita taco was made with pork shoulder roasted with some sort of red spice and what tasted like orange juice and topped with pickled onion and it was also quite delicious. I did like adding some spicy salsa to that one to kick up the heat a bit.  The menu online is rather limited compared to what they offer now but for a meal that was $13 with a drink and tax, it was a great food experience. If this place was up in Scottsdale instead off of McDowell and 16th St (by the way, easy to get there on the 202, just get off on 24th, go to McDowell, drive to 16th Street and turn. I plan to take some co-workers from the office here next Friday so I can share the experience.  Oh, by the way, found t his place because it was listed as one of the best new 25 restaurants in Phoenix in Phoenix magazine, and they were spot on. Next time I have to try the Horchata which is enhanced with pecans and fresh fruit. Bottom line, worth you time to go here! :-)  Bit of an add on - went back this Friday and boy, even at about 11:30 it was packed. I tried the Horchata this time and the best I've had - I like the pieces of pecan and diced fruit they mix in with it. I also had the steak taco, I guess it is the Condessa taco, that has the spice and olive oil mix on it and it was wonderful, especially with the oil based salsa that tastes like it is made with oil, dried crushed papers and salt, excellent, and I also ordered the grilled squash which, while not amazing, is a nice addition to the meal. I have decided, now that I've eaten there a second time, that I like the grilled steak tacos but the pulled meat, both the chicken and the pork, nothing special, and the side of rice this time, really clumpy and overly sticky, not like what I had last time so I'll give it four stars but need to do something a bit more special with the rice and beans to get a five.",

The mole is so delish and you gotta order this taco. I ordered the steak and it was good too, but my fave...the carnitas taco. The pork is so tender and flavorful! I also love all the salsas! I just wish they didn't run out of some of them...there were so many to choose from it was hard to decide what to try so I relied an a regular to steer me in the right direction. The margarita was ok, but I would definitely go back for the mole and the carnitas!",

They're much better at carne asada tacos. Also, America's Taco Shop is far better with this, which is their specialty.  The homemade salsas are awesome. In particular, I was blown away by the salsa cilantro, and the strawberry salsa. Yes, they have strawberry salsa.",

    "text": "We finally had an opportunity to check out La Condesa and it lived up to all the great reviews we had read.  We overordered as we wanted to try several things.  The salsa bar was fun.  It was nice to try a few different flavors.  My daughter who doesn't like spice really enjoyed the peanut salsa.  The tomatillo was exceptional as well.    I did not think the guacamole was well executed.   There were onions, tomatos, pineapple and cilantro but it was more pico-ish than guacamole-like.  And where was the avocado?  For $3.95 the portion was relatively small.  I would definitely pass on this in the future.      For main courses, we had the mole chicken quesa and an assortment of tacos.    The mole was exceptional and wasn't at all bitter.  The quesa itself was flaky, crisp and delicious.   If you are a mole fan, this is a must try.  For tacos, we had the baja shrimp, slow cooked pork and carne asada.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the breading light and didn't overwhelm the flavors.  I loved the pork which was moist, flavorful and satisfying.  The carne asada was very good though pretty typical street taco fare.     I will definitely dine here again.   The setting matched the food... casual, comfortable but not your typical mexican fare.  It's definitely a step above.",

    "text": "Walking into this small restaurant, i could image I was in a nice part of Mexico City.  Showing up with my customary crew of three little boys, you can imagine some people would be annoyed, but our hostess greeted us kindly and found us the space to sit down. They didn't mind at all that we had to park the stroller at the small bar. The boys were hungry monsters and we got baskets of chips right away. I found several lovely non spicy salsas for the boys, including a pecan salsa, cilantro salsa, and strawberry salsa. We ordered a mole taco, shark taco, and pibil taco with a side of rice and beans to share among us. It was plenty for two adults, two little ones and a very picky 8 yr old who just ate chips. Each taco was awesome.each was  Realy  unique in flavors. The beans and rice were both boring and bland. All salsas were delicious. It almost didnt m atter what we ate because it was all so delish. The decor was very appealing, although the walls were pretty dirty. The service was good, the music good and rather loud, which helped to drown out the baby pulverizing chips with his fists. This is not wat I would categorize as a good place to take kids, but even so, they were tolerated, and I am just not going to miss trying a place like this because I have my kids with me.  The only drawback for me was that this is a SMALL place, and it was hot and airless inside. I don't know if the air conditioning was broken, but just a room fan would have helped a lot. We were sweating by the end of the meal, and not from the pico de gallo. I hope they get that worked out before summer melts the asphalt.",

This is that place. Authentic Mexican food with a gourmet twist. So so yummy.  I ordered the el gaucho steak taco and the cabo shrimp taco. Add in a $2 Negra Modelo, and life was good. If we didn't have two kids in tow, my husband and I could have kept ordering tacos and beer.   Be prepared to go early, and the place is small...so seating is limited. Not good for large groups.

The interior is fairly nice for a Mexican food joint and what first caught my eye was the salsa bar. At least 10 different kind of salsas for the taking. This is a good omen. Gourmet Taco's feels incredibly insincere. It is like when MacDonald's have \"a la carte\" on the to of their back lit wall menu. It becomes a joke.   I had the shrimp tacos that comes when ordering some cheesy slur that most surely contains the words 'baja' or 'cabo' or something silly to that nature. I also ordered the horchata to go with my lunch. The order is two decently filled tacos with both double corn tortillas. The shrimp wasn't the long monster that I expected but instead three minor in each taco. This was OK. Then it was filled with some kind of cabbagy mass that was completely raw and tasteless - but would look good on a  picture. This was not OK - tasteless filler is pointless. The horchata was tasty, but way too much ice in the glass. The salsa bar did not disappoint - they have hot and mild and spicy and seasonal, in this case some strawberry salsa that was strangely tangy. But I love the variety.   I liked the food. Not all of our party did enjoy their meal, but I did. But it is too pricey for Mexican food.. because it isn't that spectacular at all. The price would be the discouragement for me, when it comes to my return factor. I have had better tacos for cheaper. that is the bottom line - but it wasn't bad. Not at all.   In summary; meal was good but too expensive.",

Paid $100 for 7 and the kid only offered us 4 salsa's to go. If I wanted more, I had to pay extra. At least 2-3 per person, jeeze (Trust me, they are tiny) Would have given you guys 5 stars if you weren't so stingy.   Also, bring back the strawberry spicy salsa, why remove your best?",

We both also had the Al Pastor burro which was good portioned and delicious.  Our server was friendly, however, the petite lady with dark hair when we entered was NOT. Dunno what her problem was. We \"may\" be back, but hopefully not when she's there. We got such a snotty vibe- and its not a good look. Maybe cause we're cute girls & she's a hater?  When we walked in, no one presented themselves as a hostess so I ask snotty do we seat ourselves? NO response. Ignored. Lol! Ok, so we just sat ourselves.   I agree with other reviews, that we just sat there with no water, a basket of chips, and no service for like 10-12 minutes with workers wondering around knowing that we were sitting there. We had never been here before, so we didn't know about getting our own salsas until we were sitting for 10 mins and finally were able to ask. Even a \"thank you!\" on our part to snotty woman was ignored.. Ok lol. Just cause foods good doesn't mean you should lack in service.... And your SERVICE is what I will be telling people about if they ask about your restaurant.",

The salsa bar was really fun to explore and we ended up sampling all the different salsas. The guacamole was delicious and chunky and you could see all the fresh ingredients - no fillers here.   There were so many different burritos and tacos to try and you could even make things into bowls. While not everyone in our party was a vegetarian, we had two and I'm vegan. They had multiple menu items for both, which was amazing and extremely rare for an authentic Mexican restaurant. I tried the cauliflower taco and Gandhi taco (black beans and more) and they were delicious!  We'll be back again to continue exploring the menu.",

I tried them all - the Chile en Nogada, Santisima Specialty, and Nueva Espana were my personal favorites but you really can't go wrong. The salsa bar is also incredible - at least a dozen salsas including basics like Chile de Arbol and tomatillo; and other specialties like pecan salsa. All were outstanding! Prices are affordable considering what you're getting (with few exceptions the tacos are $4-5 each, fairly large). I did not try any of the non-taco items. Note: I tried taking a few home, but they did not re-warm very well, so best to just stuff it in while it's fresh. This will definitely be a do-again next time I'm in town!",

Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  The restaurant is incredibly small. You have to try to snag a table, which makes lingering not an option. Plus, it makes it feel a little bit like people are watching you eat.  I ordered the Tinga Chicken Burrito. I was disappointed to find the chicken to be all dark and lacking flavor. The burrito had no cheese or spice. It was an okay burrito, but it was heavy and certainly not one I would crave.  Overall, I wouldn't come back.",

Uber took us out there....ummmm a kind of sketchy area but what the heck.  Put our name in and waited about 45 minutes to get seated (place is small). Once seated we ordered margaritas and had chips with the amazing salsa bar!  There have to be 30 salsas freshly prepared.....from mild to OMG that's hot.  My favorite was the Pecano......sooo yummy.           Ordered food and I chose the Mole (Black Oaxacan Mole) in burrito form.   I will say that was a damn good Mole.....probably in my top 2 that I have had.  Burrito was big and I love that they make the tortilla crispy by flattening the burrito on the flat top.  Wow soooo good. Came with rice and beans.  A wonderful plate for sure.           So if you go it's tiny.....there will be a wait BUT it is sooooo worth it.  I'm from San Diego so I do know great Mexican food and this was GREAT.  Inexpensive as well.  Give them a shot.....you won't be disappointed.",

I recommend getting the two taco plate with rice and beans. I got the Aztec Tinga Taco (Shredded Chicken, Tomato, Onion & Aztec chipotle sauce) and it was SO juicy with the perfect combination of spices. I also got a Carne Asada taco that was delish! The restaurant is small and I hear it gets busy so I would recommend dining here during off days/times. We went on a Thursday night at 7:30 PM and it was perfect!!!

Then fifteen minutes passed by and nothing. No acknowledgement, no I'll be right with guys, and no would you guys like anything else to drink. My wife and I decided to get up and leave the establishment. As we left, the same host that greeted us said thank you and have a great day. Didn't even think twice that we left so quickly!

    "text": "As someone who's travels to Southern California a few times a year, I sort of know my Mexican food especially as it comes to street tacos and such.  I do admit this place has more protein for your tacos than any other Mexican restaurant I've been in.  It can also be overwhelming the number of choices but at $3.99-$6.50 for a single taco, the prices are pretty high so I had some high expectations.  What I can say is that the al pastor tacos were dry, in fact tasted like tree bark in terms of texture.  The braised pork was good though but the tortas were very interesting, it came out on a toasted French baguette.  It was decent but I had to put quite a bit of salsa in it to moisten it up due to it again being very dry.  Imagine dry meat on a toasted French baguette.  What I believe does set this place apart is their amazing salsa bar, it's self serve and unlimited.  You get your first bowl of chips on the house, refills are $2.70.  The other thing that stood out was the horchata, it had fresh ground cinnamon, some oats and bits of strawberries on the bottom.  It was very interesting, but nonetheless, was very good.  We also had a strawberry margarita, tasted more like sugar water with a half shot of a tequila and very very sweet.  I believe the strawberry margarita was $9.00, so it was a little high.  If I ever go back, I think I'll stick with the horchata instead of their margaritas.    They said an hour wait for two, we waited outside for 30 minutes and was called, so at least that's nice.  A tip is to write your name, party size and phone number on the waiting list, they will call you when your table is ready.  And no waiting inside either, all waiting is outside.",

There is an option to do a taco llate, two tacos with a small side of rice and beans.  I'd skip this option.  The sides were quite small.  If you're hungry go for another taco or perhaps a side of chips and explore the free salsa bar.  You must order at the register.  You are given a number so they can bring out your food.  This is all fine and dandy until you have to find a table.  La Santisima is quite small and has very few tables inside.  We had to stand, basically hovering over people who were eating, and leap at the first table to open up.  I'd say it would be obvious to follow etiquette and let those who ordered before you grab a table first, but we all know not everyone is that poliet.    They do offer to-go orders if you don't want to wait for a table. I'd also recommend that La Santisima invest I outdoor seating to aleviate some of the indoor congestion.  I'll keep my fingers crossed for my next visit.",

I mean theirs so many different salsas to choose from and its all self serve take as much as you need or want.  The only thing missing at La Santisima is fresh hand made tortillas. That would make this place even better.  The inside is very nice. Rustic wooden tables and seats Mexican made. And lots of Mexican art and cultural motifs on the walls. Theirs a bar too.  Its more dimly lit so it gives the cozy feel Waiters and waitresses are all friendly and attentive. Nice place for lunch or dinner and conversation no need to feel rushed.",

    "text": "I only gave it three stars because I feel the food didn't really exceed my expectations and the service was a real buzzkill. My friends and I went on a Tuesday night, the night before Halloween. There was a line but it moved fairly quickly so that was okay. We were informed there was a shortage of menus so we had to share. That was fine too, but they definitely need to get that issue addressed in future, especially if they have large parties coming in. The salsa bar was good, but underwhelming. A lot of it were just average; some tasted like each other and many didn't have standout flavors like I was expecting. And the spicy one was not very spicy at all, haha! I presume this is because of the clientele though. I was born and raised in Asia, so I love all my sauces with lots of kick! Ok, down to the food: I got the 3 street taco mix-and-match bowl with beans and rice: carne arrachera taco, chilango suadero taco, and al pastor taco. Tbh, I couldn't tell which was which, but one of them was super dry and I needed to load up heaps of salsa to make it good. I couldn't even tell which one was the spicy pork. That being said, the other two tacos were good. The rice and beans were the standout parts of my meal, in my opinion. The beans and rice tasted fresh and wonderfully home-made. Final thoughts: the tacos were fairly decent, wasn't too much to shout about especially considering this place's past accolades, but the beans and rice were fantastic. I would come here again to try their burros, which were served to others around us and looked delicious! I had a sip of my friend's horchata, and it was yummy! The menu is pretty extensive so points for that one as well. That being said though, the service here was kinda bad; they were clearly understaffed so I hope they fix that, along with their lack of menus, in future ! :)",

We got the steak quesadilla stuffed with avocado, peppers, onions, etc... I thought to myself this might be my favorite thing I've ever had... We then ordered 4 tacos to split. I wasn't the biggest fan of any of them besides the white fish! The shark, and steak tacos were very good but the quesadilla you couldn't be satisfied with tacos... Last final thing.... We ordered the burrito to split (yes we took half of it home). We got the steak burrito stuffed with all the good stuff! WOW - I thought okay this might be better than the quesadilla but close call.

We born enjoyed our meals quite a bit although my sister liked the cactus tacos from two hippies beach house better (she's vegetarian).   They were so good you must try!!!

    "text": "Pros: Full bar, salsa bar  Cons: No bartender, watery salsas, poor service.  We visited this shop for a weekend lunch.  We were starving and didn't have a lot of time, so we opted to quickly sit at the bar.  We waited 5 minutes, and a server brought us chips.  We then went and picked out a few salsas from the salsa bar.  Out of the 4 salsas I tried, I liked none of them.  They were very thin and watery, and the plastic containers are smaller than the chips - so you can only dip the corner of a chip (but the salsa won't stick), and you can't pour the salsa onto a chip (because it will run off).  The only chips that sort of work are the 'defective' folded ones. I have no idea why everyone raves about the salsa bar, perhaps for the novelty of it, but chips don't work as a salsa-delivery vehicle for watery salsa.  After 10 minutes, we still did not have water, and 15 minutes into us sitting there, we apologized and left.  Their tacos may well be amazing, but we didn't have time to sit around.  Waiting for 15 minutes (literally) with no water delivery during an AZ summer should be criminal.  There appeared to only be 2 servers for the entire restaurant, and no bartender, and they clearly couldn't handle a lunchtime rush by themselves.  Luckily, there are many other excellent taco shops in the area.",

I ordered the Gandhi vegan burro with red enchilada sauce over it. I highly recommend it to anyone. It was huge so I had to take half home. However, it was so delicious I ended up eating the remainder several hours later for dinner. The house margarita is definitely worth the order as well. Mixed perfectly! We were both truly blown away- well for two gringos born and raised in AZ who've had our fair share of trips to numerous cities in Mexico. This place is small- roughly 32 people can dine in. While we were there there was not one empty table. I'm glad we stopped in- we will be back.",

There were so many things to choose from, but I thought a place that bills itself as 'gourmet tacos' should get a chance to live up to its name--and it did. I chose the 3 taco platter so I could sample different ones. Each was unique and tasty. The barbacoa was probably my favorite. There is very little parking and there was a line inside but it was worth the wait. Baskets of chips and orders were going out of the kitchen every few seconds. We got there a little before noon and I don't know if it was because they were so busy, but every table was cleared and cleaned within minutes, or less, of being vacated.

It's a small place, so expect a wait unless you go during off times (avoid lunch and dinner). The salsa bar is incredible, so many different variety of salsas from cilantro, pecan, to a delicious jicama or a bomb pico de gallo. The quesadillas aren't your typical ones, they fry them entirely that it almost looks like a empanada/quesadilla hybrid but they're so good! It's True about what they say about the horchata, it's the best I've tasted. They put pecans and chopped fruit in the horchata giving it some extra flavor a but its so delicious. My favorite tacos are the Shark tacos! Try them! Only reason why I give them 4 stars is because the service is alright. Sometimes they are not staffed adequately and it takes forever to get your order in, other than that, it's a great Mexican food joint!",

    "text": "We were so impressed with this place and so surprised we had never heard of it!  Salsa: There are something like 20 different salsa to choose from in their salsa bar but our favorite was the salsa mexicana which was nice and garlicky with chopped cilantro. You scoop the salsas into little plastic containers similar to what you'd find in a taqueria but this is definitely a cloth napkin type of place. Luckily, there are free chips with which to try the many salsa so you can pick your favorite before you food arrives.   Food: So fresh, warm, and just plain delicious. We split the Santo Plato and Traditional Quesa. The Santo Plato comes with your choice of burro and taco with a side of calabacitas. We chose the fish taco which conveniently came with two pieces of fish and two tortillas so it was like having two tacos! It was traditional fried fish \"Baja\" style but it was light and crispy instead of greasy and came with a savory white sauce. The La Condesa Veggie burro was filled white Mexican-style rice (but not that orangish \"Mexican rice\" you see at fast food joints), Oaxaca cheese, mushrooms, spinach, poblano pepper, onions and fresh garlic. The burro is grilled after its assembled which enhanced the mouth feel. Crispy outside, soft inside. The calabacitas were just grilled green Mexican squash, nothing special. The Traditional Quesa was unlike anything I'd ever seen. They're made with a THICK, dense corn tortilla, stuffed with Oaxaca cheese, and then grilled for a nice crunch. These bad boys are HUGE and have so much cheese which made me relieved to be sharing. You have to eat it with a fork and knife but it was amazing with different salsa varieties drizzled on top.   Drinks: Try the Horchata! Best we've ever had. They put real fruit and pecans in it. There was some sort of strawberry syrup in the bottom but it was not overly sweet. The serving size is 32oz which was a lot bigger than we were expecting. We didn't get any alcohol but I overheard the guy next to us tell the waitress his margarita was amazing.   Atmosphere: Be prepared because this place it TINY! We got there at the right time because when we were leaving all of the 10 or so tables were full. People didn't have room to wait and some turned around and left as soon as they came in and saw how crowded it was. There is an itty bitty bar that a few people chose to wait at. The decor is cute but the custom made chairs were a bit fragile as I had to switch mine out due to the bottom falling out.   Overall: We know Mexican food and this may be the best we've ever had. We'll have to go back for a few more visits to be sure but for now we certainly left smacking our lips with the delicious flavors we had just tasted on our lips and on our minds.",

    "text": "I have been waiting to write this review until I was really inspired, because I wanted to do this place justice.   Sitting at a coffee shop, a little wired, listening to some amazing Explosions in the Sky in my headphones, I finally feel I'm ready.   The bad: North of McDowell. I mean, this place is supa close to me, so I'm happy, but I really wish this place had a sexy downtown location because it is so freaking good it would blow up if more people were near it. I feel the location, although keeps it a hidden gem, also repells people from going, although let me be the one to tell you, it shouldn't! You NEED to go here if you are chippy and salsa person. Bottom line. Not optional. The absolute BEST in Phoenix metro ever. If you disagree, hit me up and I will pay for your meal. I'm not kidding. I believe in it that much.   The good: The Salsa bar. Jesus Christ himself would call this Salsa bar a miracle. From reds, to greens, to peanut, to hot, to mild, chunky and smooth they have everything, hand made from scratch and incredible. The flavors actually rotate so some times you'll go and get a new treat to try. Most of them are inspired by regions of the world and have salsa flares about them. I can't stop, thinking about it now. I may leave this coffee shop and go there for lunch today now...   The gourmet tacos. Incredible, large chuncks of savor steak, giant shrimp (yah I know that makes no sense), and great corn tortillas make this no flour boy a very very happy camper.   Obviously you'll need to choose the right salsa to add on top of your already incredibly delicious taco, but choose wisely. The flavors are already perfect.   I hope this review has done it justice. It's incredible and needs to be in your rotation. Especially if like taking your friends out to new places they have never been before.",

Just perfect, and the trimmings they throw in it (crush nuts, various fruit cuts) makes it all the more amazing. Third, their godly baja shark and cabo shrimp tacos. Have gone with friends many times and I can ever get myself to stray from my mainstays here. There are days when they're slammed and the quality of service drops, which is why they get a 4 instead of a five, but the food and the taste never fails. Also, cool little side note if you're a football fan, and or Patriots fans, Julian Edelman and his squad dine there each time life brings them to PHX.",

Then I see La Santisima on TV and I freaked out, and realized they're open on Sundays.  I managed to shower and get dressed in record time to make it there by noon. They tell me it's a 40 minute wait, and my stomach plays a symphony of sounds only okay in a hospital to be heard, I say \"that's perfectly fine\" and then go drunk sweat outside in the sun. 40 minutes went by and I prayed the tacos would be amazing and worth the wait.  We got seated inside and helped ourself to every single salsa at the salsa bar. There were a few that lit my threat on fire, but,  whatever, alls fair in love and salsa with this gringo.  I got the three taco plate with the mariachi loco, Cabo shrimp, and chicken tinga as well as a half order of the guacamole. I LOVED the guacamole, the tinga, and the mariachi... I felt the Cabo shrimp could've used something. But one thing that kind of was lacking was the service, not that I minded. I was content with my horchata to nurse my hangover. But our server forgot about our guacamole and I think the table next to us may have gotten the wrong order (the owner corrected it). I'll let it slide because they are crazy busy at all times.",

Decided on their taco combination plate which is a order of 3 tacos along with beans and rice. Salsa bar was pretty good as we're their chips. Unfortunately their rice was awful, was overcooked and microwaved to a large glob of paste. Honestly it was unappetizing to have it on my plate as it made me think that the rest of the meal was also microwaved. Made a comment to the waiter as I felt it could be a point of improvement. He received the criticism well.   Don't think this restaurant is deserving of a four star based on my experience.",

    "text": "First, let me begin this review by saying I'm giving you my honest assessment on my personal experience! This is not a five star establishment! The service was good and the staff was friendly.  I dined with a party of five.  We each ordered the taco plate ($14) and Margarita's ($9).  The drinks came back and they were not premium.  Definitely not made individually at a bar because they don't have one. The drinks were from a pitcher or a pre mix?  The plates came back lingeringly!  The beans and rice was not hot!  The shrimp, fish were battered and fried, than placed in a corn tortilla and buried under shredded lettuce and sauce.  The presentation was nice! However, the tacos were not crisp, but soggy.  The over all atmosphere was dark!  The lighting is poor!  The woman's bathroom is in the middle of the restaurant! Hard not to see the coming and going of the patrons!  One bright spot is the salsa bar!  They gave us 2 baskets of corn chips and we delighted over the various salsa's. The restaurant was full and had a continuous flow.  I'm sure the \"diners and dive\" episode from 4 years ago help considerably to the restaurant success.  I'm not certain if the expansion of the business since the episode aired is the culprit of my poor experience?  The location downtown did provide diversity and interesting patrons.  However, for the price of our tab ($138) I'm expecting more!",

I'm always up for trying new things, so I'm hoping to one day find that dish that I cant resist, but it just hasn't happened for me. Seems a bit overpriced.   Drinks: Best thing about this place, IMO. Prices are decent, sizes are good, and they all (or at least the ones I've had) taste fresh.   Staff: Friendly, but never had a server that makes me feel like they are happy to have me as a guest. Everyone I have had seems to be just going through the motions and doesn't really want to be there. I've worked in the restaurant industry for 10+ years - you're not only a server, but a performer. You gotta put a little effort in making the guests feel welcomed.   Environment: Salsa bar can get a little messy (to be expected), but otherwise the restaurant is clean. Lots of cool artwork to admire.",

    "text": "This place has been bookmarked for well over a year. I finally got to try them out recently, and on Taco Tuesday, no less!  I love that they allow you to mix and match different tacos to create your own taco plate.  I ordered the following 3 tacos:  Tlaloc (grilled cactus, caramelized onion, garlic, jalapenos; I omitted the additional options for this taco -tomato, mushrooms, and queso fresco)  Guisado Tenoch (Grilled Cactus, Potato, Guajillo & red salsa; I omitted the mushrooms and queso fresco)  Mexica Ahuacatl (Beer Battered Avocado, cabbage, salsa jicama; I omitted the pico de gallo and the salsa cilantro, the latter of which contains dairy)  The Guisado Tenoch & Mexica Ahuacatl were by far my favorites.  The Guisado is terrifically tantalizing to the tastebuds and needed no extra salsas.  The Ahuacatl was equally delicious once I added some Strawberry Salsa. (It's delicious alone, just a little dry w/o the salsa.)  I wasn't a fan of the flavors in the Tlaloc, which were too tart and robust to my liking. Just a personal preference.   I ordered my plate with rice and black beans, and I mixed them together.  The flavor of the beans was delightful; they were seasoned perfectly, and not too salty.  (It's my understanding that the refried beans contain dairy, so vegans should stick to the black beans.)  Another shining star here is the unlimited salsa bar, which features about a dozen different salsas.  The salsa ingredients are not listed, but after spotting a particularly milky looking one, I inquired and discovered that there are a few salsas which do contain dairy, including the pecan salsa and cilantro salsa.  I have since been informed that the following salsas are all vegan: salsa 7 chiles, arbol, cabo, chipotle, sesame, peanut, strawberry, pico de gallo, jicama, cruda, tomatillo, rabano, and the Mexicana. The guacamole is also confirmed as vegan.  The strawberry salsa became an unexpected favorite, winning me over with its refreshingly sweet and spicy flavors.   The service was great and I absolutely adore the wall art.  The only thing I do not like is that the bathroom is in the dining area and several people kept leaving the door open... The salsa bar is right outside that door. As an OCD germaphobe, I was terribly bothered by this.  Aside from that, I love this taqueria and cannot wait to return and try the rest of their vegan menu.",

    "text": "This place is one of the best experiences in the city! They opened up years ago under a different name without a liquor license but with the same sexy, sexy salsa bar. They got awards a few years in a row from The New Times seven or eight years ago when they were new. (That's actually how my college friends and I found about about them in the first place.) I think they've had to go through some phases with the salsa bar-everyone used to come in and just take twenty salsas home, so they went from limiting how many salsa containers you could get to how many lids you could get to at least limit take-home, and recently i've seen them just allow you to grab as much as you want again because no one has the time anymore to take ten-there are too many people crowded around you! If there's one thing that's constantly changed over the years I've been going here, it's that every year that goes by this place gets more crowded. One day, they'll need a bigger restaurant. Until then, I'm sure they'll continue to add gorgeous decorations like the fly paintings and the beautiful bar. OK: on to the food!  I've noticed a few expansions in the menu in recent years, but I'm going to stick to describing the basics here because they're what make this place so good. (Well... basic foods done impressively well, and intriguingly not-basic salsas.) The menu is great here because they have regionally themed dishes for various mexican states-not all 31, just a handful, but each one is starkly different, comes with different toppings and it's possible to have each meat various ways. basically you can get your meats as tacos, burros or as a quesadilla. You're going to have to just think about it before ordering-they'll make you whatever you want, but some combinations are better than others. For instance, a Mole burrito is baller, having Cochinita Pibil is just brain-melting in a quesadilla, and I could eat their fried shark tacos any day of the week. (The steak is good every way.) Don't blame the restaurant if your Mole quesadilla doesn't make a lot of sense, haha-they'll give it to you the way you ask for it. Just pay attention to the toppings when you're picking your mode of dinner. You won't regret it. I seem to have mentioned the best things in my personal opinion already... the cochinita pibil is perfect and I only know one other restaurant in AZ that makes it right, and it's much more of a fine dining place than la santisima here, so I give them a lot of points for correctly marinating the queen's dish, one of the best meats I've ever had. It's easy to describe the meats: perfect. Time to move on to the salsa.  The award winning salsa bar is second to nothing in the city. If you don't try the peanut salsa, you're missing out. Even though it's changed over the years from a spicy cream salsa to a spicy salsa and back to a spicy cream salsa, it's always been phenomenal. The pecan is more of a cream since it's not spiced like the peanut. The \"red pepper\" isn't exactly salsa-it's red pepper oil, and if you have a leftover side of it, fry pork chops in it... you'll be all set to go back to santisima the next day to start it all again! There's everything from pico to several types of vegetable salsas, and the cilantro cream is good at cutting the heat you've added to any dish.   If you want to taste some of the food people leave Arizona talking about, look no further than this fun little hole in the wall. One of the plus sides is probably going to be that you could come back to this place on every visit, and bring your kids and grandkids here someday: hopefully this gem never leaves the streets of our spicy valley!",

Ours enjoyed the cliantro one and the Pico de gallo. She tried a few others but immediately downed water and her face turned a little red. She may have grown a little hair on her chest. Our favorite salsas were the peanut and guacamole.   I had the street tacos. Carne Asada taco was on point. Ranking the 3 I had 1. Carne Asada 2. Al Pastor 3. Chicken  Wish I could tell you about the rice but the girl ate it all, so if she ate it I'm sure you will enjoy it too.   Next time I need multiple margaritas. Happy hour, anyone?!?!",

I do have a couple of complaints to say; during lunch time the place gets packed and has very limited space. The dining area is very small. Some portion sizes are unreasonable for the prices they charge (ex: torta below charged at $9.00) And the waitress/cashier during the day, skinny with black hair is extremely rude. She has no customer service what so ever. She seems bothered when you ask her questions about their menu or just in general. If you read through the reviews I'm not the only one who thinks so. She makes our visits  very unpleasant.   Other than that I recommend the quesadillas. I gave this review 4 stars because of the food but if I had to go by service then I would give one",

They had horrible flavor on each of them.  The port was boring.  I got one that was deep fried and it tasted like grease.  I would never ever come back here for tacos.

Then we ordered tacos....after waiting an hour from ordering we decided to leave. We did have a single coke and a very small bowl of guac. This cost us $12. The food that came out to customers after us ( some who had gotten there a full 30 minutes after us) did look wonderful. The guac was tasty. Our server basically avoided us the entire time.

The service was slow and they forgot our drink orders a few times.  But the tequila they suggested was good.  Here comes the most important part.. their food.  We ordered their shark taco to share.  I had their El Gaucho Burro and my wife had their El Gaucho Quesa.  My wife is not a big quesadilla fan, but she liked it and it was so good when I tried it!  Her quesa had the perfect crisp texture to each bite.  My burro was excellent.  Since we both had El Gaucho, the fillings were the same ingredients.  Here's the climax.  They put cucumbers and bell peppers into their El Gaucho Burro and Quesa; that is a genius idea!  Those 2 ingredients brang out the taste of each individual ingredient from our burro and quesa.  Man, it was good!  Prices are good.  They have their own salsa bar.  I recommend their creamy cilantro salsa.  They also have good spicy ones as well.  A chips refill for your chips and salsa will cost you about $2?  Oh yeah, this place is pretty small.  They try to utilize as much as they can.  Very rare you will find Chinese eating Mexican, but I saw a few here.  Got to come here.",

Great selection and favorites were the salsa verde Cheap beer - Modelos were $3 My favorite taco was the Al Pastor, added pico and extra lime  CONS Very small place, we got there early to avoid the wait Seating by the window can be VERY warm especially during these summer months Music was static and scratchy it was annoying while eating The chicken mole taco was such a disappointment - the flavors were not right The rice was non traditional was just plain with no cilantro or salsa/seasonings  Did we eat most of our taco platters? Yes. Did we think service was a little spotty and can be improved? Yes. Do we think that our divey place in Downtown Chandler is levels above this \"modern/more pricy\" version that is out of the way location wise) for us? Yes.",

    "text": "Best Mexican food I had ever had. Of course, this isn't saying much considering East Coast Mexican food has nothing on West Coast. Now I know.  I came here twice. This place was so good,  I dreamed about eating their shark taco that night. And the next and our last day in Phoenix we went back to get more. Nice way to round out our stay in Phoenix. Best meal for last.   First Night: If you don't get the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco, you are missing out. Perfectly crispy beer batter. Amazingly soft and tender fish. Topped with cabbage and some kind of yogurt or mayo sauce. Not sure where else you can get dogfish shark tacos, but I wish all my fish tacos could be shark from now on. Make sure you order the shark taco and not the regular fish one.  If you're not a seafood person, the Mayan Conchita Pork Shoulder is a good taco to get. The pork shoulder was cooked until tender and the sauce was delicious and flavorful. The pickled onions on top is a perfect combo with the pork.  Second Night:  The second time around I had the shark taco again. This time I also tried the Cabo Shrimp Taco. Another amazing taco. The shrimps were large, and I'm not sure what they put in their batter but it was so crispy with a nice tang to it. I also tried some of the Al Pastor Street Tacos. Order this if you want something strong in flavor and charred. The street tacos are also cheaper than the gourmet ones.  Sides: The Guac was chunky and fresh with tomatoes, cilantro, onions, and I think cranberries. The salsas were all average until I tried the jicama one. It's so fresh with the lime and cilantro. Best salsa I had ever had. Each table gets a free basket of tortilla chips. We got two for our table of four.  I never had horchata before, but it seemed to be the recommended drink to get. I wasn't a big fan of it. Not that it wasn't good, but I'm just not a fan of horchata in general. The pecans, cantaloupe, and strawberries did provide freshness to the drink, but it was too overpowered by cinnamon. The drink is huge at 32 oz.  There is only one guy acting as a server, so service can be a little slow. But these tacos are worth the patience. The restaurant itself is a little bit cramped but there is enough seating. There's also one large table for a big group.  On a side note, I saw a picture of Guy Fieri on a board next to the salsa bar. He seemed to have signed it with the date 12/14. Future Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives joint?",

Insane flavors.)  *Salsa bar-most impressive I have ever seen  *Menu-large and intriguing (I want to come back to try just about everything listed) *Atmosphere-great artwork   *Service-stellar   This place is so good that I was telling my waitress I can't wait to come back, and I hadn't even finished eating.

Our server was sweet and fab as can't be. I got the pastor quesa and it was so good. My sisters got the mahi burro and a variety of street tacos. The little ones snacked on our food and had a quesadilla to go. One of the other servers unknowingly handed it to the wrong table, but they were so kind and remade her meal--plus she had the amazing horchata. She did not want to share, so she was mostly concerned about keeping her little brother at bay! The quesadilla was so flavorful. I love the larger than usual chunks of pineapple, and the cranberries in the chopped guacamole was so nice and bright. I expected more cheese after the shrimp fundito, but I'm a cheese person. The burrito was killer and came in second. The street tacos were well seasoned, carne asada was deliciously tender. I definitely recommend this place!",

The well ornate sit in resturant has a great vibe, bright colorful art work and a strong Dia de Muerto sets the right mood. Service is great and simple, from the self serve salsa bar to the strong drinks menu, adds to the home feel.  La Santisima's staple taco is a must have. Nicely toasted cheese over well seasoned steak makes for a great combination.  The roasted peppers and onions add a nice balance and grilled mushrooms just work. Not much on sauce but the beef and vegetables highlight the entree.   Mayan cochinta was loaded with flavor. Tender and savory pork shoulder has a ton of favor, the pickled onions help add a zing to the dish. Recommend you have it over a plate cause it'll ooze down you hand.",

They can't add beans inside like somebody mentioned, only on the side (make sure to ask for beans without cheese on top) If you are a \"junk vegan\" you may be good to go. I personally hardly eat fried things and wanted to make an exception for this. They fry the whole thing so it sits in a layer of oil on the plate and the spinach and mushrooms etc inside are soaked as well - all I tasted was the oil. I have only been vegan for a year so I can imagine this must be really good with the cheese but in vegan you may be better off with a burrito or taco.  Omni hubby had the tacos and loved them! Salsas are really nice as well, cilantro, pecan and Mexican were really good. I would go back to try their other stuff!",

They have a rather large menu, and I was pleasantly surprised to see how many vegetarian options they offered. They have a nice, fresh salsa bar, however many of them contain ingredients that are smoked, which I do not care for, but they were still rather delicious. The strawberry, peanut and rabano (radish) salsas were surprising and tasty.  I ended up ordering the Azteca tinga lonche and a Pacific white fish taco. The taco was good, but the breading was a little soggy, and came with way too much mayo. The fish flavor overpowered pretty much everything, even when I drowned it in salsa. The first bite of the lonche reminded me heavily of manwich...something I have not eaten since I was a small child. The flavor was too tomato-y, much like manwich, and was tough for me to finish. The birote it came in, however, was delicious and crunchy. It pains me to give a low rating, when other diners are dishing out 4 and 5 stars. I would be willing to give this place a second chance, but good bread and salsa is not enough to entice me back just yet.",

    "text": "Are you tired of, or bored with, the typical Sonoran fare that surrounds us on nearly every corner in the valley?  If so, then you need to put one of the two locations of La Santisima on your list. The only things that you would recognize are the usage of the words: tortilla, taco, quesadilla, and burro. It's that unique.   I've eaten more times than I can count at 16th St, and several times in Glendale. Here's what you need to know between the two. The original 16th St is small, almost cramped. Parking is literally ON the street edge, and around the corner. It can be dangerous backing out of your spot into the northbound flow of 16th St. You will often find a wait to be seated, and there is no indoor waiting area, just a bench outside, and seating for perhaps six at the (full liquor) bar. You will more than likely be privy to your your neighboring diners' conversations, as well as bumping into them at the salsa bar. It's got wonderful ambience, certainly, but it's not for large-parties, or those having issues with claustrophobia, or anxiety that might be sparked due to tight quarters. Those using wheelchairs or scooters should go directly to Glendale. There is ample parking in the rear, and at neighboring venues. The dining room is at least twice, or thrice, that of 16th st, and there is patio seating along Glendale, outside. I've not ever had to wait there, due to the extra seating available.   The salsa bar gets much praise from other reviewers, and I'll get that out of the way first. Yes, there are a dozen, or perhaps 14 choices there. However, batches are kept small for freshness, and they may not have a couple of your faves once you've discovered them. However, there will certainly be ample remaining choices to top your light, airy, housemade(?) chips. Your first basket is gratis, but they do charge for extras (sometimes, LOL). It's very, VERY easy to ruin your appetite with these, due to the wonderful tastes and combos that you simply have not likely seen elsewhere. Chopped jicama, lightly salted w/cilantro? A roasted combo of several different peppers, and onions? Watermelon salsa? Peanut mole? You get the idea....  The menu lays out their special recipe combos pretty well. You can certainly get a standard type street taco plate, with or w/o rice and beans, with several of their takes on the standards, such as carne asada, al pastor, etc. The rice is simple, yet not your standard rosa-colored 'Spanish' rice. It even appealed to a former Asian g/f, who ate plain white rice as a staple. Beans are on the creamy side, more 'refried' than charro style....again quite tasty for their type. However, I almost always succumb to one of their bowls. All can be ordered as burro wrapped in a large tortilla, but I always get a bowl. Afterall, I know I will be semi-full from those chips! I've had the House Special bowl more times than I can remember, and it does not disappoint. But, I've explored out of my comfort zone a time or two, without disappointment.  Quesadillas come in a large fresh corn tortilla, unlike anything I've ever seen at another restaurant. That adds a unique texture and flavor to their already delicious fillings. However, if you think you would be put-off by it somehow, be sure you specify that you wish to have a traditional flour tortilla.  I have to make a special plug for their guacamole. Like other recipes, this one is unique, and  darned yummy. They add cranberry, jicama, and I believe mango to your standard avocado blending. It's creamy green nirvana. Well worth that second basket of chips, for sure. Don't plan on sharing a small serving with any more than one other diner. Otherwise, violence could very well break out at your table.   Well then, it's time for dessert. This is perhaps the only reason I am hesitant to provide them with 5-stars. Frustration! Their take on a leche flan is quite different than what you're used to (that's the theme here, right?). Picture more of a tres-leches sponge-cake, because that's what it is (in my book), and what it should be called (to my thinking, LOL). Suffice to say, in the many times I've eaten here, it's been sold-OUT all but ONE TIME!!!!  I even ask for it BEFORE I ORDER MY MEAL, just in the hopes of reserving one for myself at the end. No such luck, LOL.   Alright, it's time to go eat!",

The waiter never mentioned the salsa bar. I knew it was there but still. Then they didn't take a drink order. After waiting for 5 minutes we walked up to the bar area and begged for water. Last thing I wanted to do was eat chips with salsa without something to drink for over 45 minutes. Another 10 minutes went by before they finally decided to take our order. Then the wait began to get our drinks. It took another 15 minutes to get our drinks--sodas, nothing fancy. This was after we watched the waiter make plenty of other drinks for other tables. He made 3 margaritas for a table that got there after us. Finally after one hour and 45 minutes our food arrived.",

I was excited to see how amazing the salsa bar was!  I opted for a creamy cilantro sauce.  It totally kicked up my burrito!!  I could order that burrito each time and use a different salsa and never get bored!    The service was top notch and the prices were very reasonable.  Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!",

    "text": "The salsa bar is \"all that and a bag of chips!\" \"Since when do you go to a salsa bar, where the salsas are actually really full of flavor, thick (not watered down), and unique?!\" as my friends put it so well! It's sounds strange, but the pecan salsa was delicious! The peanut salsa was still spicy but had a hint of peanut in it, so it wasn't overwhelmingly \"peanuty.\" There was a strawberry rhubarb pepper type of salsa. This may sound a little too strange for most, but it was almost like a spicy dessert type sauce. Don't forget to order some margaritas to wash those salsa and chips down. I would say you could get filled up on salsa, chips and margaritas alone here and be more than satisfied, but I'm not sure the owners would be too happy about that! The salsa variety was nothing less than astounding! And don't worry your precious little heart. There are traditional ones too: green tomatillo, chipotle red pepper, jicama, and cilantro... just to name a few!  Slow roasted cochinitas pibil (pork) tacos, slow cooked chicken mole tacos, beer battered Dogfish shark tacos, battered shrimp tacos, el gaucho steak in chimchurri sauce tacos with guacamole. Oh gawd, yes! And affirmative... these were all eaten in one sitting.... well, with a little help from Bryan too. He's so thoughtful for that too. I might have died from eating too much. We live so far from here that I just wanted to \"stock up,\" and I came oh so close to having to be rolled out of the place like that \"blueberry girl\" from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!",

    "text": "WOWWWWWWWW  Seriously, wow. We took the kids here one night when we were looking for someplace good to eat. We were going to go to America's but we used to live there, so we tried this place out instead. It's right down the road, so we were like \"what the hey.\" Firstly, the outside is so cool looking. With that big ol sugar skull thing. So artsy. I was a little nervous we'd be out of place. But then we thought... \"well, it's not in the nicest area, so it can't be too scenester\" SO glad we made that decision. So we go in with the kids and sit at a table. The seating area is very intimate, I didn't mind that. The decor is really cool, gotta love a place with a great ambiance! The server was really nice, not overly nice. He did a great job. Omg the salsa bar is amazing. We tried them all! The kids loved trying them and naming them. The cilantro salsa.... never had anything like it in my life.   I had the fish tacos that were such a relief. I have had some bad fish tacos in the past so I was a little nervous. But wow. We also had a margarita. They were both strong so I got to finish my husbands. Yay for me! :)   I was a little disappointed that there isn't a kid's menu. I think they should make a small taco plate for kids, and maybe an option for a small burrito with a side of beans and rice. But the kids made due just fine. My daughter had a bean and cheese burrito and my son had 2 of the carne tacos. They both loved their choices and my husband swapped a carne taco with one of my Son's fish so they got to try it all. Yum. The chips were also great and made it nice to be able to dive right in to all the salsa options.   The price might be my favorite thing. All four of us ate, got drinks, and my husband and I had a margarita all for about 40 bucks including a nice tip. You really can't beat that! We will DEFINITELY be going back to La Condesa!",

Finally, I did notice their large statue thingy outside of the establishment. It was all lit up as I drove by during the evening. When I realized it was a gourmet taco shop, I knew I had to go asap.   I went with my boyfriend and we both went to TOWN on their chips and assorted salsas. My favorite was the pecan salsa. Sweet and spicy! For our meals, he ordered 3 tacos and I ordered 2. The pork tacos were slightly bland and made me worry at first that I was going to be let down, but then came the chicken mole taco - oh my! Delicious! Sweet and savory, it was perfect. I know that sauce is difficult to make too, so, well done. Most of the tacos actually don't come with cheese - you know why? Because the tacos are so bomb you don't even need the cheese really. Their flavors are very carefully picked to taste a certain way. Save the cheese and salsa for the chips! You'll enjoy the tacos just as they are.  YUM!",

    "text": "Thank you Yelp. I just received an email with Yelpers' reviews of Burritos. Usually the recommendations are far and away or not fitting my food mood. However, La Condesa was right in my wheelhouse.   The location is ok, but the interior is spotless and fun. Lots of Day of the Dead and Luce Libre to enjoy while you choose salsa from the 12 or so available. Did I mention that there are a lot of salsas? For a condiment king like me, this is heaven. Peanut and Pecan Salsa, WHAT!?! Both were tasty and new flavors. Mayan Cochinita Burro jumped off the menu. I had beverage ordering anxiety and caved to the Horchata. Best Horchata I've had. There are nuts, strawberries and other tasty floaters in it. The burro came, and it was lava-esque. I couldn't touch it for 20 mins. Luckily I had salsafest 2011 to keep me busy. The burro finally returned from the sun and it tasted delicious. Melt in your mouth stewed pork and refried beans in a possibly homemade tortilla. I'll be back.   $12 Food, drink and Salsafest.",

My favorite is the Mayan Cochinita Pibil, so good Johnny Depp would've shot him dead in Once Upon a Time in Mexico! haha Seriously so good, plus they give you chips with endless salsa! My secret is to mix the spicy green salsa with the creamy cilantro! I love this restaurant so much I would marry it! lol",

    "text": "I ordered the green chili chilequilles with poached eggs and a margarita with a corona. The food was awesome and the drink was superb but what really impacted our first time experience was the wait. It took about 5-10 min to get water but she did bring our chips out first. They have small plastic to go cups for salsa which is an inconvenience to keep going back and forth for refills, not to mention half of the sauces were bland, (had no flavor).   At this point we ate two baskets of chips and still didn't get our drinks we ordered from the bar. Our food actually came our first then finally my margarita and two mechiladas came. We ate half our food as the chips filled us up from waiting so long. The food was delicious but the service needs immediate attention.  Another issue I had was that the ladies room had no hand soap so I decided to let the staff now. Shouldn't they check this prior to opening? It's unsanitary if the staff goes to the restroom and touches food.   All in all, I'd give it one more try but I'd go if I'm not in a hurry to go anywhere. If you are on a short lunch break, don't come here unless you're ok with showing real late to work. Hopefully I can leave a better review next time I visit. Great food, bad service when it comes to timing. Otherwise our server was nice.... btw there was only a couple dining and three girls. They place wasn't packed so I shouldn't have waiting about 25-39 minutes for my drinks and food (-_-)",

    "text": "So myself and a coworker passed by this joint and loved the outside decor for the sign. Yelped it, and bamb! A whoppin 4stars huh, so today we stopped by to try it.   Let's just start off with the entrance to the place. Line to the door. No tables open. One cashier, during the lovely lunch hour.   The tables weren't bussed yet so we sat at a dirty table till it was cleaned. Can't blame them as the line never stopped from growing and to go orders were huge as people walked out.   Food arrived and then the taste buds had an awakening. I tried the Cabo Shrimp taco, Mayan Cochinita Pibil taco, and Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Shark Taco. All are very delicious just as is. Did not need the salsa bar they have but tried them for the chips the give while you wait.   Only downside to the joint is the tortilla. The tacos seemed like they served them on some you get at Frys and or even a knock off, definitely nothing gourmet or authentic about those.   Overall spent $16 on three tacos priced 3.99 each and a drink. Will I return??? Probably not, maybe to try others from the menu. But not worth the 4/5 stars!",

    "text": "Santi and I came to La Santisima looking for a good Mexican fare, and walked away pleasantly surprised by the overall experience. The small, squared-shaped interior included a small dining area, a full salsa bar, kitchen, and a small bar area in the back. The wall-to-wall paintings and artifacts were striking, and nicely added to the casual and festive atmosphere. The menu consisted of an eclectic listing of gourmet tacos, street tacos, burros, deep-fried corn quesadillas, and lonches.   The Al Pastor Burro ($8.95) arrived with spicy pork, homemade salsa, pineapple, tomato, lettuce, guacamole, onion, cilantro, avocado, and al pastor salsa. The burro was tightly wrapped in hot pressed tortilla. The spicy pork was nicely seasoned with sweet pineapple to brighten the flavors. The rest of the supportive ingredients added subtle touches and kicks. The textures of the onions, lettuce, and tomato were noticeable, but I wished there could be more guacamole to round out the flavors. The burro was sizable, and good to share when cut in half. I recommend it.  The Aztec Tinga Taco and Maya Cochinita Pibil Taco ($9.39) came with rice, black beans with Oaxacan cheese, and two sizable double-decked tacos with shredded meat and red onions layered on top. The Tinga Taco encompassed tender shredded chicken, tomato, and chipotle salsa. I wished there could be more chicken, but the taco was mouthwatering delicious. The Cochinita Pibil was made with pork shoulder wrapped and slow cooked in banana leaves, lime marinated onions and salsa to add acidity and sharpness. Their distinctive taste from one another made the experience worthwhile. The rice and black beans were not simple fillers, but instead they were surprisingly flavorful and addictive.   The Tialoc Veggie Burro ($8.95) was put together with mesquite-grilled cactus, caramelized onion, garlic, tomato, mushrooms, jalapeno, and Oaxacan cheese in a tightly wrapped hot pressed tortilla. Personally, I prefer the soft, spongy, and stretchable flour tortillas, but the firm and hot pressed version was surprisingly good, resilient, and held everything together quite well. The grilled cactus came in large pieces, and the pleasant textures nicely complemented the generous earthy mushrooms. The Burro could taste bland for some people, but the addition of melted Oaxcan cheese added nuances to the sweet and savory flavors. If I were to order this again, I would add guacamole and more cheese to the mix.   Lastly, the Arabe Burro ($12.99) had plenty of al pastor, hummus, aguacate, pastor salsa, lettuce, cucumber, tomato, red onion, avocado, red pepper, and Tzatziki dressing on top. In this case, cognitive dissonance can be a good thing, as this Arabic-inspired burro was a hit. The sweet and spicy pastor coupled nicely with the smooth hummus, and the support ingredients rounded out the flavors by bridging flavors of the two worlds. This is one of the worthy items for those looking for an adventure, along with their great looking deep-fried corn quesadillas at many tables.   The chips were refilled upon request. Among the 12-salsa options, my favorites were the chunky chipotle, smoky Cabo, sweet pecan, spicy Mexicana, peanut, and spicy avocado. Unfortunately, the cilantro salsa had an overpowering sour cream flavor, and some of the other options were too watery, didn't register, or live up to my expectations.   The restaurant can get very busy throughout the day, so service was not their strongest attribute on each visit. The food took some time to arrive, but the salsa bar and complimentary chips were there to scale down the hunger pains. I thought the prices were a bit higher than San Francisco and Los Angeles. However, there was a nice mix of original and innovative flavors to set them apart. Quality-wise, the food was less greasy when compared to a traditional taqueria. Interested diners should come open minded, and not expecting the most authentic fare. I hope to return to try their Oaxacan Shrimp Mole Burro, Chicken Mole Street Taco, and Pumpkin Flan. 3.5 stars for the overall experience.",

Holy cow this was delicious with the spicy salt on the side!!!! (Sighhhhhh) I was sad when I finished it...three drops of tears came out. We got some of the tacos for appetizers and let the waitress order them for us. Let me just say that the baby shark was fried to perfection. The signature taco everyone needs to try because the flavors coming off the steak were tasty and forced me to sit back and enjoy. Finally for our final dish of the day we had a Quesa which is this interesting take on a quesadilla that was more like a stuffed sopapilla with a delicious filling of steak, mushrooms, peppers, onions and some sort of magical dust that made me fall in love! This place was awesome and the only reason that it lost a star was that they seemed short staffed  and the poor waitress was running everywhere and appeared to be the only one there.

Even the horchata is quite large and they sprinkle all sorts of toppings to it.  The salsa bar also contained items I usually don't see in other taco shops.  The green salsa was spicy and delicious.  I was surprised at my bill being over $21 (3 tacos + beans/rice + horchata).  Regardless of how fancy a taco is the price shouldn't be so high per person.  It's a freakin' taco.  Also I wouldn't recommend parking  on the main road facing the restaurant.  Some are signed for another business in which after I opened my car door someone popped out and sternly let me know they will be calling the tow on inappropriate parked cars.  Also these spots when you back out is super dangerous as cars on the main road are racing by pretty fast.  There is a parking lot on the side of the restaurant that is much safer.",

It's very different from the mole we get in Los Angeles, richer, more of a heady chocolate flavor with a hint of sweetness.  Delicious.  The tortilla soup was also quite yummy and their salsa selection was outstanding.",

But it definitely wouldn't stop me from going back. Menu is very extensive and you can customize.",

When we had our food.. we understood why the name.. we reacted with \"ay santisima\" lol!   The salsa bar is very creative and gave us mad options like the \"peanut chipotle\" and more. Now let's talk about these margaritas.. man oh mighty.. best margaritas I've had! and I've had my fair share of em! It's strong enough and they throw in a slice of grapefruit that really gives it a nice zing! The service was great, yes the bar is tiny and they clearly are understaffed but that didn't stop our server from giving us 5 star service! Drinks came quick and so did the food! Now the menu.. it can be a little intimidating and overwhelming with the immense options.. but definitely go for something you haven't had before, you won't regret it! I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I've been coming here for years, since it was named La Contesa.  I've also referred numerous business clients and friends.  Never again!  Not only has the service gone downhill, the prices are outrageous.  The one server brought us stale chips, unsalted.  There were at least 4 bussers working the place, but only one server???  Very odd for a 5pm dinner rush.   The guacamole and cilantro salsa taste as though it had spoiled.  Ordered queso fundido with mushrooms, a chicken taco plate, and a chicken burrito with enchilada sauce.  Never got the queso - no big deal I guess, somewhat expected when you have only one server and it's busy.  Rice was cold for both entrees.  The kicker was the final bill.  They now charge you for meat on your tacos and burritos.  It cost $20 for a chicken burrito with a side of cold rice, no beans!!!  The menu says extra charge for shrimp or mahi mahi tacos (2.95 to be exact), but nothing about a chicken charge for tacos.  They charged me $2.97 chicken on the tacos!  All in all, based on the quality of the food, the horrible service, the prices, the weird smell, and the stagnant air (A/C wasn't working in the first dining room), we won't be coming back.  Very sad, as this was one of our favorite restaurants in town.",

I definitely recommend this place, but it doesn't have the WOW factor.  The Pros: Awesome Salsa Bar - about a dozen delicious salsas. The regular Mexican salsa was flavorful and spicy. Some nice rare options too. Service - Our server was very nice and attentive. The Al Pastor - I tried the premium carne asada, fish taco, and al pastor. This is the only one I would go back for - great taste and tender pork.  The Cons: Price - Like double the price of what I'm used to paying for any kind of taco. Pepsi brand soda - Hells to the no!! and they didn't have Mexican coke either (they were apparently out). Bleh on the fish taco - again, I am spoiled because I only eat fish tacos in Baja, but the batter was very soggy and bland.  Small place and tight parking but it wasn't crowded on a Sunday.",

We arrived on a Sunday afternoon (around 4ish) and found several couples waiting to be seated and were told that there was a 20 minute wait for 2, which was odd as there were several empty tables. The AC was not working and it was over 100 degrees outside which made the wait even worse. I was pleased with the Grapefruit margarita while we waited but then my hopes were dashed again as our waitress was very...forgetful? Ditzy? Lost? The menu was enormous and too confusing, the salsa was all very spicy (some people who enjoy Mexican food do not like super spicy), and the service was just pitiful. We waited 20 minutes to order, and then another 20 for a beer. The food was good, but overall it just was not worth everything we had to go through. I was looking forward to trying the Flan and having a nice, cool horchata for dessert only to find myself being disappointed again because they were out of flan and the horchata tasted like watered down milk. Needless to say I will not be coming back here again. My advice: if you have a few hours to kill: try going on a weekday in the middle of the day and hope for the best.",

I went around asking the entire crew what they would rate this place ... all of them either said 1 or 1.5 out of 5 stars.. When we got in, we had to wait for 45 mins to get a table... I mean that's understandable given the fact that we were a large group... once seated.... everything is just so slow. We ordered and the food literally took about 45-50 mins to come out. That's way too long. The waitress was nice. (only reason why I'm giving them a one star). I advise this business to give chips for free since the wait is so long. Anyways, overall ... not too happy with the service.. and the food wasn't all that at all. There's a lot better Mexican restaurants around!",

It had good flavor, but the shrimp was a little dry. I also found that the steak in my burro was a little dry.  Again, it had good flavor, but i was disappointed in the meat. The grilled squash that came with the plate was good though!   I decided that I had to try the horchata because of all the reviews.  It was pretty good, but I didn't care for the chunks of fruit.  It was difficult to drink through the straw towards the end, and I ended up wasting 1/4 of my $4 drink...   Pricing is higher than noted.  My plate was $12ish and the horchata was $4.  After tax and tip, it was over $20.    All in all, it was a decent meal/experience, but I probably won't go back.",

I could have paid 65 cents for the squash and pan grilled like they did. Very sad. I wish they made tacos like they use to before they went on triple d (food network). They still have good salsa (strawberry is delish) but they have lost the taco. I don't wanna pay $4.00 for a chincy taco that has no filling. Btw give more beans and rice, it doesn't cost much to make either so give at least 2 tablespoons instead of one. I'm very serious about the serving size.",

We had a group of 5 and all ordered different dishes - all were extremely flavorful and well prepared - difficult to choose the one we all liked best.  The service was barely a 3.  People were nice but we didn't see our water much and took long to get a drink, the check, etc",

    "text": "I was going to meet a friend for lunch at Barrio (one of the only places you can get \"real\" Mexican in Phoenix, which I could never understand -  we are less than 4 hours from the border!!). Unfortunately, it was before I yelped much, so I neglected to notice that they were closed Mondays:( Dejected, we drove down the street looking for someplace else to go. I can't remember if it was the Catrina that drove us in, but as soon as I saw the salsa bar, I knew I was in heaven. It was like actual food that I've actually eaten in Mexico (rather than assorted patterns of tortillas, rice, beans, and cheese). Now we take all visiting friends and family to this place. A visitor from LA said they were the best tacos he had ever eaten and I'm sure he wasn't lying.   Many people have commented on the salsa bar. My favorites are the creamy ones (pecan, peanut, and cilantro) and most of all the sesame (to me, the spiciest one on the bar), and usually I try to sample some of each one - but taste is in the eye of the beholder. The important point is that you don't want to fill up on the chips, because you will be sad when your huge plate of food comes. So I'd like to share my strategies for maximizing the salsa enjoying experience without getting uncomfortably full.  I start by limiting myself to 5-6 chips which I break into smaller pieces for dipping. Once the food comes, I take the second tortilla from each of my veggie tacos (the tacos themselves already have just the perfect type and amount, so it's pointless to try and add more) and use it to scoop up the salsa. With only the one remaining tortilla, you do get some drippage, but you can add more salsa to any veggies and cheese that fall out and eat it with a spoon. Then for dessert, I pour the cilantro salsa on my rice. Mmmm, salsa. I would buy this stuff by the tub if they would let me. BTW, I asked - they just laughed.   The only draw back is that my poor husband tries to order a margarita every time we go, and they still don't have any. I hope someday they will take his advice and add it to the menu.",

    "text": "I have been to La Santisma about four times.  Their wide range of tacos and salsas make it a must for anyone looking to go beyond your regular Arizona Mexican Food.  This place is a very hip establishment with lovely art and decor reflecting the Mexican American culture.  The tacos themselves are quite delicious.  I had difficulty deciding on what to eat because everything looked delicious!  The salsa bar has something to suit everyone's tastes. If you want something mild, medium, or hot, they have it.    This place is not a secret, and space is limited.  Be prepared to wait for seating if coming during dinner hours.  My only issue with La Santisma is that they charge for refills on tortilla chips.  I understand that they are running a business and giving out unlimited chips could be detrimental to the bottom line.  However, with so many delicious salsas available, it would be nice to be able to have some refills to really take them all in and pick a favorite.  I give La Santisma 4 stars due to decor and quality of food.",

    "text": "We came to this restaurant because every time we go to a new city we try new places. We like to watch Diners, Drive ins  and Dives and we try some of the places that they mention. This was a mistake. When we first got there, we had to wait even though there were four tables available two partially bussed One was completely cleaned and one was not at all bussed. There was a couple in front of us waiting and they seemed irritated as well. When we finally get seated we go to the back of the restaurant and there was a few tables available. They explained to us that they ran out of ice so that's the reason they were so behind. I'm sorry I don't understand how a restaurant pretty much shut  down because they ran low on ice. So they show us to our table the hostess sets the chips down and says help yourself to the salsa bar. We make our way to the salsa bar and are greeted by a sign that says extra chips are 2.40 or something and a salsa bar that was almost completely empty. We waited 10 minutes decided to go back there was a man standing there and he had mentioned he asked for cups for the salsa a few minutes ago and they still have not returned. Also the salsa was still not refilled. So we ate or chips with no salsa. We also asked for some guacamole prior to going to the salsa bar the second time the waiter said he thought they might be out of guacamole but he wasn't sure he would let us now. 10 minutes later he comes back to take order completely forgetting about the guacamole and when we asked he said yes they were out of guacamole. It was odd the would be out of guacamole and they can't refill their salsa bar but they give you chips and tell you to enjoy the salsa bar. So we order our food and if I'm being honest it's pretty decent the beans are amazing definitely The best beans I've ever had. The rice was really good. I ordered a margarita with a Corona. Usually those come in a margarita glass the Corona upside down in it. This came in a  tall highball glass Filled about a quarter of the way and the corona on the side it was absolutely terrible. And then the server who I will say it was pretty decent gave us our check came back and picked up our cash and the first thing he said is I don't have any change you guys. And I don't know why but  that bugged me really bad because first of all it was only seven dollars and you're a waiter how can you not make change for a customer. We actually didn't want any change but what if we had. All in all it was not A good experience and there were several people in the surrounding tables there also unhappy especially with the salsa bar being so crappy. And I don't understand and I cannot wrap my head around The fact that just because you're out of ice you can't seat people I don't even understand. Maybe they just had a bad day who knows!",

Most of the table got tacos and I got the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken Quesa.  I also ordered the Horchata which was very tasty with the addition of nuts and fruit but when done left a pile of stuff in the bottom.  The Quesa was delicious, quite filling and actually made two meals for me.  Just a note: mole does not do any better in a microwave on high than gravy, but it still tasted fine.  Service was fine and she split the checks after she had already given us a single one.  We were dining fairly early but as the evening wore on it got pretty busy on a Thursday even with a major Haboob going on.  Definitely a place worth checking out!",

I had a stomach ache before even walking out....I honestly should have asked for a different item. I don't know what was wrong with the meat. The portion itself was huge. Very large plate. The salsa bar I liked, lots of different options, Inside was cute. Warning though, parking is a hot mess, its literally on 16th st. Good luck getting out of there during traffic. Waiter was nice, but slow. Over all I was disappointed. I will say, the beer battered fish taco sounded good. May go back to try that, but other than that based on what I ate, we wont be returning.",

I walk in on a Friday evening and the big heavy door closes behind me and all I see inside is all this pretty art hanging, as well as, the bright colors and decor. Super cute! Our server was so polite and very very informative about what specials there are , as well as, extremely personable. My date and I started off with the cheese quesas and it amazed my taste buds. So good! It was a meal in itself, so big! The masa was so crispy and cheesy! I've never had this before... like ever! I had no idea these were in existence. Game changer for sure. My date had the carne asada tacos, which so delicious (don't judge me bc I tried them too!). The meat wasn't chewy or small. I decided to have the gourmet tacos, which were a dogfish shark  taco (amazing), shrimp  and a flavorful Mexican mignon taco, de-f*%ckin-licious! All of the tacos were so delightful, but the mignon taco hit the spot. The meat was so tender and the chunks were so juicy. I can't stand when I go to a taco joint and their meat is so tiny and crispy. This by far took it to another level. Somebody's nana put their foot in this recipe for sure (not literal) lol. The house margaritas were great and my Paloma was huge! Bingo, bango, bongo! Total hit!!! Loved every bite. I ate so much, I swear I was going to burst. I just couldn't get enough. I'll be back!   Catch me on IG @Rezzilient to see more pictures and places I've been! Like and follow.",

The restroom was lacking in cleanliness and that always kind of rubs me the wrong way because a restaurant restroom should be clean. The salsa selection was nice, but I was not impressed how it was displayed and we had to make many trips to get more salsa as the little containers were too small... :/ The service was OK, however it took a long time and I mean over an hour to get our food... We all ordered something different and nothing stood out. We all got free samples of beer because of some promotion.  That was the best part. Hahaha! Would I go again... If a friend was going to take me out there and pay for my meal, I wouldn't complain but it's not on my list to come back to. :/",

    "text": "Our only stop for Mexican food while in Phoenix for a wedding...and La Santisima did NOT disappoint!!  Enter a warm and inviting restaurant with beautiful portraits of calaveras hanging on the walls. We were there for an early supper (about 5 pm on a Sunday night) and we were seated immediately. The restaurant did seem to fill up around us, and by the time we left it was probably half to 3/4 full...for good reason!  After being seated, our waitress brought us a bowl of fresh house-made tortilla chips and indicated the salsa bar along the wall. There were about umpteen different salsas to try, including both fresh and cooked favourites, such as pico de gallo (translated: rooster's comb :P) and salsa verde. I give the salsa mexicana 2 thumbs up; the cilantro salsa was mild and creamy - I didn't dig it quite as much.   Apparently everything is delicious in this restaurant, but tacos are their thing. I ordered the mix and match platter with the following tacos: the barbacoa, the Santisima specialty with mahi mahi  and the Marlin. The tacos were served with the most delicious rice (tasted as though it was cooked in a rich broth) and yummy refried beans sprinkled with melted cheese. OH AND - the plate is actually a large, square stone/ceramic plate about an inch or more thick...and it is HOT. It kept all of the food super toasty for the entire duration of our meal - which was a fabulous way to enjoy the last taco :)   The taco winner of the evening was the barbacoa - between the texture of the braised meat, the sauce and the homemade corn tortillas, this was by far my favourite. Rich and savoury and served in double corn tortillas... you can't really go wrong! The marlin was my second favourite, only because it was served in a fried corn tortilla and covered in sauteed onions...the filling of the taco was tasty enough but not a highlight. Finally, the specialty came in last, but I think it was only because I chose the mahi mahi - which was cooked through (not used to eating that particular fish cooked). I would certainly try it again with the chicken, shrimp or steak options that were available because the sauce and other filling components were delicious! It was only the texture or the cooked fish that threw me off...   All in all, La Santisima stands out as a fabulous choice for Mexican cuisine on all fronts: food, ambiance and service!",

Once our server finally came by, the experience was great! They have a really good salsa bar and lots of menu items that I've never seen before. We had their $3 negro modelo special, a shark taco, a marlin taco, and 2 chicken mole tacos...DELICIOUS! The atmosphere is nice too! All in all, it was a good experience and we'll be back!",

The furniture is older and certainly reminiscent of the Sonoran culture. The food is made fresh in house and has so much flavor! This location is the original one, there's another in Glendale and apparently one in Flagstaff too... but I'll keep coming to this one. My margarita was also the bomb! Give em a try for sure!!",

They have a salsa bar with many options to choose from in my opinion it needs a spicier salsa and I would remove maybe a couple. The waiter messed up our order and never brought a lime we asked for. At the end we got a complimentary fruit horchata which was really good. The place is a little bit too dark as other tables where using they phones to light up the menu in order to read their menu. Menu is a little confusing as well. Over all food wins and that's why they deserve the 5 stars for me.",

Instead they opted for a clip on style flood light ..with extension cords running through peoples table .. when they turn the flood light on the blinding beam felt like we'd been spotted by border patrol crossing the US Mexican border at night.   Also here's a tip ...if you run out of guacamole every single day maybe you should make more guacamole in the beginning..just a thought..  That being said the tacos are tremendous!",

I wish I could have packed the salsa bar home with me, but unfortunately, it doesn't work like that. (TSA has a limit in liquid ratios).   I tried almost every salsa from the bar and I have to say, the best one is actually a combination. Mix the guacamole and peanut salsas together, and you instantly have salsa crack. I could have eaten tubs of the mixture and still wouldn't be sick if it. The heat of the guacamole salsa balances quite well with the umami of the peanut salsa.  Street tacos were good too but my mind was on the richness of the salsas. They should just change their name to Salsa Heaven.   Other than the salsas, please note the service was subpar and the prices on the menus and what they actually bill you is inconsistent, but only by a few cents so no point in arguing.",

We ordered a three taco sampler plate,  and, while the presentation looked colorful and different, each taco tasted pretty much the same.  I will say, however, their guacamole is fantastic! With that said, it was $6 for a small bowl of it. Also, they have a nice selection of salsas at their salsa bar.   I give it two stars for the lackluster food and also the environment. There were flies in the restaurant competing with my every bite, and the women's bathroom was horrible. Everything was broken!  The toilet paper dispenser, paper towel dispenser, door lock, and even the toilet seat.    The restaurant was very busy for a Thursday afternoon at 2:00 so I may have hit them on an off day.",

I ordered a variety of three soft tacos with rice and beans and sliced avocado. Pretty authentic. LOVED it!! If you love True Mexican meals, try this place.

Surely you'll have a heart-attack immediately after, but it's worth it. I almost think it's time for them to update locations, and get into something bigger since it's a nightmare to try and eat there around the lunch rush time, also its sort of rustic appearance doesn't quite match how good their food is. If it wasn't for recommendations from friends previously, it's the kind of place where you'd walk in, take a quick look, and walk out. Needless to say, don't allow that to deter you from exploring their menu, you surely wont' be dissatisfied.",

A confluence of negatives brought what should have been a five-star review down - fast.  1. Our waiter didn't have his heart in it.  He barely smiled, didn't share any pleasantries and was drier than toast.  No offer to refill water, to show us the dessert menu.  Just overall lacking in basic customer service skills.    2. When was the last time you went to a Mexican restaurant and didn't bring home a doggy bag?   The portions here are for a bride-to-be trying to lose weight before a wedding.  The shape of the rice was a 1/4 measuring cup.  The refried beans were about 2 tablespoons worth.  3. The wait for menus.  The wait to be acknowledged.  The wait for drinks.  The wait for the meal.  The wait for the check.  i wanted to belt out that tacky song: \"Cuando, cuando, cuando?!?\"  4. The temperature.  Lukewarm food is not cool.  It sat somewhere for some unknown reason.  I'd usually send it back but damn!  I thought I'd eat next week.  5. The outside at night.  What's up with the no lights?  We drove by the first time because we had no idea it was open.    6. The margaritas are creative but DAMN!  Inordinately expensive.  We are not on the Upper East SIde of Manhattan.  7.  The plates.  I guess they're reminiscent of Mexican pottery but they looked like they could contain lead.  No bueno.    The salsa bar is killer - they make their own unusual and tasty concoctions (pecan salsa?).  Quite lovely.    But they really need to step up their game and stop resting on the laurels of Diners, Drive Ins and Dives.",

    "text": "After seeing the great reviews on Check Please and DDD, I was excited to give this place a try but after our recent visit, my family and I will never come back to this restaurant.   1. The sign stated wait to be seated. We patiently waited about 10 minutes before a woman finally came up to us with a menu and told us to go cash register to place our order.   2. The tacos were nothing special and far from \"gourmet.\" The salsa bar, however, had a wide variety of salsas, but not one was memorable.  The tacos were overpriced for what you get and there are definitely better tacos in the area and much less expensive. The rice was good so if you prefer rice over tacos, then this place is for you.  3. Lastly, the ladies room was filthy and visible from the main dining room. Not that we could see the door to the restroom while we ate but the door remained opened with the toilet clearly visible to my and other tables. Gross, yes but to make matters even worst, it appeared as if the restroom hadn't been cleaned in several days.   Very disappointed!  I truly hope this was a one off experience, however, I don't think I have it in me to try again after such a lackluster and frustrating experience.",

Everything I've had here tastes delicious - from the tacos, burritos, tortas, and quesas (like a quesadilla but made with a fried corn tortilla) which are a must try! The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review is due to the mediocre service. It sometimes takes over 10 minutes to have someone come over and put your name in and the table service is average every time I've been. Nonetheless, I continue to come here regularly because the food is so tasty!",

This place is seriously small, we went on a Tuesday afternoon and it was empty, though I can see La Santisima filling up quickly during the evening. Our waitress was reserved, but not rude.  It's not in the best neighborhood, which is kind of sad, because there's an elementary school across the street, but I feel like the best eateries are usually in someplace sketchy. Often, you must venture outside your comfort zone to experience the sublime.  Also, I neglected to try the salsa bar, I was so memorized by the pastor tacos. I'll definitely return on my next trip to PHX.",

I had the chicken mole burrito and it was about as close to \"perfect\" as it gets. They took the simple finishing step of grilling the burrito lightly, which gave it some crunch and made it taste like a non-fried chimichanga. Why don't more places do this?? The salsa bar had more options than I had time to test, but each one I sampled was delicious in its own way.  I wasn't expecting a full bar, but yep, they have one of those, too.  The atmosphere is better on the inside than you would think by looking at the outside. It's small though, so don't be surprised if there's a wait.  We will be back many times in the future!",

Eat the gaucho taco and absolutely the al pastor. The al pastor is a smaller street taco served in two corn tortillas but full on flavor. The meat is tender but with just the right amount of chew and the spices do a great job of cutting the richness of pork. Add a little jicama salsa for crunch and variation. Chips are good, they're thin enough you can eat several without getting too full. I love the rice-it has corn in it? I'm a textural person and it definitely adds a little character to rice.  I've seen people sipping on huge cups of horchata and that's definitely next on my list of things to try next time I'm back.",

I like the decor with day of the dead theme (think Disney's Coco) and family like atmosphere. I ordered their Horcata and it is one of the best I ever had (had fruit in the drink as well). Prices are average if ordering tacos individually, I ordered 3 street tacos in a combo and it was under 10 dollars with rice and beans. I tried 3 different flavors and they were equally as good, their Carne Asada taco was on point. Even the plates were unique, like sand-carved style. Overall, the portion size was good, started off with complimentary chips and your choice of salsa from the salsa bar, it was a feel-good plate and experience.  Highly recommend if you visit the Phoenix area..",

What we didn't expect for a party of two after waiting 30 minutes in a half full restaurant was to finally get a table only to be ignored. It took another 40 minutes for someone to take our order. This was after the bar couldn't understand we wanted two drinks.  The food is good but not so good that you can't get equally good food along with good service elsewhere.  The cauliflower, peanut salsa taco is good. My second taco wasn't the right order. I waited some more. When the beer batter avocado taco arrived it was a bit bland. Good texture but not a lot of flavor. My boyfriend ordered the pork and pineapple burro. It didn't have any pineapple in it. Pork was minimal. It relied mostly on the filler of lettuce and onion.

Then the hubs & I saw a DDD review & being a mole freak fan had to come & try the Chicken Mole Taco. Boy freakin' howdy. The best mole I've had well since EVER. I sincerely loved it. The hubs got the fish burrito with Mahi Mahi & it was divine. The tortilla & fish were super fresh. The molie I want to take a bath in & eat my way out. Just amazing. We tried a mango margarita we shared. It was sweet but not the usual margarita mix sticky sweet grossness by any means. We loved the salsa bar too. So many salsa choices & not 14 varieties of green & red traditional salsa. FYI a chip refill is $2.40 but worth it. Very creative delicious salsas. Loved the entire experience. The place is small so it is a bit cramped as it you feel like you're sitting at a few tables at once & the whole restaurant has only 2 servers on a busy Saturday night. They seat you, take your order, refill your drinks, deliver your food, bring your check, they are the cashier & bus their own tables as well. So it's not like you're waiting because they're flirting with a busser or on FB behind the drink stand. They are BUSY! So be patient & kind. The food is worth the slowness. Now run & enjoy the taco deliciousness!",

Simply because Guy Fieri graced this place with his presence; I love him as much as the next person but that doesn't make this place entitled to 4.5 stars. Everyone else who rates it 1 or 2 stars nails it!! The atmosphere is down right disturbing, a twilight zone experience! I kept thinking the entire time \"How does this place have 4.5 stars and 699 reviews?\" \"How?\" \"I just don't get it?\" \"Please explain, somebody explain it!!\"  Service: They have the approach of we have an outstanding reputation and you can take it or leave it attitude.  Food: The salsa bar is unique in that there are a variety of combinations, some strange, peanut, some good, pecan, most have a good kick! But the salsa cups are so small you can barely dip your chip! I got the cheese quesadilla, just not my idea of good, at all! Looked beautiful but too much cheese and I LOVE cheese; cheese is one of my top two favorite foods! That should say a lot! I ordered a side of beans and rice and the beans were really good! That is why I gave two stars for the beans and beans alone!!!  Atmosphere: The tables are not level, extremely dirty, the chairs are upholstered and covered in stains and filth! I am not hard to please, I'd be up for a good hole in the wall joint, as long as you felt like it was clean and they cared about you being there! But this place is just down right weird! I love the other girl that said this place is schizophrenic! Pure craziness!",

From their website:   Our aim is to deliver everything that is exciting and fresh about Mexican cuisine to the people of Arizona, banishing old perceptions of heavy, greasy, taste bud-searing, so-called \"Tex-Mex.\"  And they nailed it.  There were 13 different salsas when we went, and all differing with heat and ingredients.  Not a traditional place.  Be aware: there's not too many tables, and waiting seems to be expected by patrons.",

    "text": "\"Oh wow, what did I get myself into?\" was all I thought as I pulled up to La Condesa.  I'm not familiar with Phoenix or the surrounding neighborhoods, so I was a little taken aback at first.  The business looks like an old house, as most of the businesses in the area do, i noticed lots of bars on the windows, and the majority of the business signs in the area were in Spanish.  THE ONLY reason I noticed this is because I'm unfamiliar with Phoenix and was traveling alone.  First impression, the restaurant is tiny! I would say that at capacity, the restaurant is pretty loud and I had a difficult time hearing my server. The tables were very close together, all the chairs were mismatched, and the lighting was really dim.  It was very difficult to get to the back of the restaurant where they put the salsa bar.    The house margaritas were made with fresh grapefruit and lime, and that was perfect for me. Unfortunately, the food wasn't as good.  I had the shrimp burro, and it was really sloppy.  It melted out of the sleeve and fell apart while I was trying to eat it.  Plus, some of the tails were left on the shrimp... let me tell you about shocking!  The service was sub-par, in my opinion.  My server was inattentive and didn't ask how my food was.  I had to flag down the server like an air traffic controller in order to get my bill, and it took a while to get my bill back.    This one is not a revisit for me.",

    "text": "Okay, so I literally live a few blocks away from this place. There are so many Mexican options in the area, but I knew this was one we had to try.   First of all, the place is tiny inside. We had a 15 minute wait on a Sunday afternoon which was a little annoying, but also proved that they aren't lacking in business. The worst part is that there is literally no where to stand. So we kind of tucked our bodies into a corner and tried to stay out of the way. That was kind of awkward. I was surprised that this was a sit-down restaurant. I was really expecting an order-at-the-counter type of place. In fact, I still think that would've probably worked better.   Once we got our table, we were brought a complimentary basket of chips and a tall bottle of water to fill our own cups with. I like that the chips are free (especially since they have all the delicious salsa options), but I was disappointed that you get charged for chips after the first basket. We ordered the guacamole to go with all the salsas and were pleasantly surprised. My husband makes guac at our house all the time and I'm a bit partial to his, so I was excited to try such a refreshing, different take on guacamole. Pretty tasty!   For our main course, I ordered the veggie quesadilla and my man ordered the bean and cheese burrito. Both were delicious! I have to admit that I wasn't a fan of the fact that the quesadillas are fried, but the amazing cheese made up for it. I was worried that I wouldn't have enough cheese with all the veggies they stuffed inside, but I was so very wrong. I seriously could not get enough of that cheese! I am craving more right now...  I guess one of the downsides to this little place is the fact that it is so packed inside. We literally were just a few inches away from the table next to us (and the guy nextdoor was so annoying!). They also only had two servers scurrying between all the tables so the service was not the greatest. We had to wait awhile for drink refills and the check which was a little disappointing. The food does come out quickly though so if you're hungry, you wont be kept waiting.   So yes, I was quite pleased with our first visit to La Condesa. We will be back.",

The prices are exceptional for the quality of food & portion size.  Very authentic food!  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "I've been to La Santisima twice, and it's definitely one of my favorite Mexican places ever already. It was what changed me from being someone who didn't like Mexican (though I grew up where the only Mexican was Plaza Azteca-level Mexican) to someone who loves it and is excited to try more!  PROS: - The salsa bar: Great flavors and variety! My favorite was the Mexicana, but mixing the pecan with the jicama was also divine. We accidentally tried the strawberry salsa (it was unlabeled when we went, and we thought it would be spicy), but it was also surprisingly delicious! - The food: I ordered the taco plate both times. I arrived starving and left stuffed beyond measure with a to-go box in hand (and I eat a lot.) I ordered the Cabo shrimp taco and the Pacific white fish tacos on separate occasions, and they were both fried perfectly, without being too fishy (which I like). I loved their chicharrones taco, but my boyfriend (who doesn't have general sentimental, warm and fuzzy feelings towards chicharrones like I do) found it a little tough. I can't currently remember the names of the other tacos I got, but they were all phenomenal. I've also heard great things about the burros. Just thinking about it makes me hungry again.    CONS: - The service: I'm not sure what about the service makes it so slow; the first time I went, it was packed, and understandably, service was slow. But yesterday, I went and there were probably 15 tables open, two groups ahead of us, and it took about 20 minutes for us to get seated, with no explanation for why we weren't being seated. Additionally, someone at my table ordered a bottle of wine and it took them about 10 minutes to come back and say \"Sorry, we don't have that. Would you like something else?\"  Tl;dr: If you have time to kill and good company, definitely worth going to. If you care about service quality and speed, maybe not.",

I love the peanut salsa and cilantro salsa.   A new favorite is to mix the jicama salsa with the cilantro salsa. Sooo good.  My go to is the bullet burrito.  I love me a good bean burrito.  The house margarita is big, fresh squeezed, and swimming with citrus pieces to nibble on.  It is so delicious!  My favorite menu item is the quesa!! The Smoked Marlin, and the veggie quesas are loaded with flavor! Oh, and try the guacamole! They put cranberries and jicama in it.  I hope you'll love it as much as I do.   :)",

    "text": "La Santisima is a great option for legit Mexican in Phoenix. The food itself is 5 stars; the only thing preventing a perfect 5/5 was the service. The waitresses were very friendly and by no means provided poor service, but definitely left some to be desired with only a 2-3 total pit stops to the table. In all fairness, it's a bit \"divey,\" so it's part of the experience.   This originally caught our eye as it was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, as well as great reviews. The selling point and highlight of our visit was the salsa bar. I consider myself a salsa pro (I refuse to buy jarred salsa, I'll only make my own), so it was fun to sample 15+ varieties. Pro tip: only the first basket of chips is free. Additional baskets are $2.40/each.   Our tacos and burro were great themselves, but did need some pizazz from the salsa bar, perhaps by design? After we doctored them up a bit, we wiped our plates clean. The tortillas were especially delicious. Value was also great. With water to drink, our total after tax was less than $20. Overall, I would recommend La Santisima!",

    "text": "Love how their menu basically blasts TexMex as giving Mexican food a bad representation. Now this is authentic Mexican food. Not some heavy just because we're Americans portion.   Ordered a lonches. Because they wanted to be different from a torta. But even in the mindset of what a standard torta is, these lonches are WAY BETTER. Bread sustains itself to the fillings (instead of falling apart or soaking up stuff like a torta bread does. Ordered shark. So that was different. There was a freshness to it due to a cucumber to give it a nice crispness to each bite. Brother ordered the al pastor lonche and he thoroughly enjoyed it as well. Girlfriend ordered the mole quesadilla. And yes yes yes! Delivered on the multiple layers of spices within the mole. Man, have I always only had flat moles (such a sad fact). Now, I can imagine not being able to order mole from anywhere else ever again! Eeeek! But do give it a try. Oh, and this quesadilla looked more like a dessert. But nope. A nice balance between the spices of the mole, meat (chicken), and cotija cheese that's sprinkled over it.   Also tried their horchata. Once again, flavors up the Ying-yang! Theirs nuts, melons, freshly mashed strawberries. So definitely not your typical Americanized Mexican restaurant.   Tip: don't park in the front. It's extremely difficult to back out into the busy traffic street. Especially if you're alone. Somewhat more doable if you have someone standing outside the car giving your a thumbs up.  Remember: food adventures are out there. So eat 'em up!",

    "text": "I can not say enough good things about this restaurant. If you come for no other reason you have to visit the salsa bar. There are no less then 20 different salsas. My favorites are the pecan (yes PECAN), cilantro, chopped chilies with garlic and the jicama. They say the first bowl of chips is complimentary, but I have never been charged for additional chips. There are so many delicious choices on this menu, and there really hadn't been an order I have regretted. I always come back to the chorizo fundido and the veggie quesa with extra cheese. I have tried about every quesa option at this point and the meat in this quesa, while optional, detracts rather then adds to the flavor. The chorizo in the appetizer more then hits my carnivore button. I would also highly recommend the tamarind margarita, with its tangy tamarind fruit muddled into the drink and the chili salt rim, you can't go wrong. On the way out you have to order a horchata to go. With its fresh strawberries and chopped walnuts it is unlike any horchata you have ever tried. You may be tempted to get one with your meal, but that would be a mistake. This drink is so complex and delicious it needs to be sipped and savored. The spices, flavors and textures of the food needs only ice water and a single shared bottle of Coca-Cola to complete the experience. They don't offer dessert, so take the horchata to go. You won't be sorry! I would also like to add that apart from the burritos all the menu items are gluten free. You need only stipulate corn tortillas when ordering things like fundito or as a side to the soup.",

I've had their bullet burrito, azteca Tinga burrito, shark tacos, shrimp burrito, quesas, guacamole, and their veggie burrito. Everything was great I have no complains.   If you love horchata you have to try theirs. I promise you will love it! I can go in there for just that a bullet burrito and chips with salsa. LITERALLY.    It is a very small place so I wouldn't suggest coming during lunch/dinner hours. You will just stand there looking at everyone enjoy their food thinking to yourself \"ok can you please hurry and swallow your meal, because it's my turn to sit and swallow mine\".

From scanning the menu, it seems like the concept here is La Santisima wants to give every regional tradition of Mexican cuisine its chance to shine through a specialty taco. They absolutely knock that goal out the park.  I wish I had 4 stomaches so I could have sampled everything. What I did get though has given me reason to go back again and again to accomplish that goal.   Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco - bomb  Cabo Shrimp Taco - Bomb.  Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco- BOMB!

They had a spicy avocado salsa with a real kick and you really can't knock the huge basket of fresh chips you get while you're waiting! Can't wait to come back and try more tacos!",

    "text": "FINALLY!!!!!   I moved to PHX about 6 months ago. Obviously, I expected to find lots of great Mexican places. So, on a Friday afternoon I had some extra time and a strong craving for Mexican. When I found out Guy from DDD had paid this place a visit, I had to give it a whirl.  First - it is TINY! I actually drove right past it the first time. The service was top notch with my waitress guiding me thru the menu. Unfortunately, at the time I am *starving* so looking at all the possibilities and making a decision is practically impossible.  About that time, the waitress walks past me with a quesadilla... It was love at first sight!!!!! And again at first bite!!! I went with the pork shoulder with pineapple. The thing about these quesadillas - think a Mexican version of a calzone! Which is basically pure magic. I can usually put down some serious food - I could barely finish 1/2 of the quesadilla.   Based upon the reviews, I had to order the Horcheta. WOW! They were not exaggerating about the size. It was a steal for $4.   My only regret was that I only had room for the Horcheta for desert. I saw another table with what i assumed was tres leeche cake - it looked delicious!!!! Next time perhaps.  This is my current place to beat for Mexican. 1000X's better than The Mission... Especially considering dinner for 4 at The Mission was $100+.... Here it would have been maybe $50.",

    "text": "I've held off on writing this review because I knew that to sit down, revisit my visit in my head, and dream of the flavors would hurt my heart. There is NO Mexican food in Hawaii. I repeat, there is NO Mexican food in Hawaii. Don't let anyone fool you...there is NO Mexican food in Hawaii. See, now my heart is already aching.   It was 10:20 PM on a Saturday night when I touched down in Phoenix. Somehow, I made it out of the airport before 11 PM and that is how my journey to La Santisima began...  Hurry up, catch a Taxi, and Yelp the nearest, best Mexican food that is still open! BOOM, La Santisima!   Arrive to La Santisima with my colleague at 10:58 PM. Okay, I know it's fucked up. Let's be real. This is the nightmare for anyone working in any kind of customer service. \"Oh you want help right when I am in the middle of ending my day? No really, ENDING my day in 2 minutes. Please get the hell away from me.\"   We knew we were taking a chance, we knew they might not seat us, or even let us order food to go. We walked in, with our luggages, and we saw the jaws drop. \"Yes, hi...we just got off a 7 hour flight and we are very hungry. Can you help us?\"   We see that half the tables are already stacked up but after a sigh, they seat us. Mind you, there was another couple in there WAITING for the rest of their food. Praise Jesus, hallelujah!   The menus were handed to us promptly and in the same motion, we apologized for coming in so late. The very nice man, I think the owner or at the very least, the manager, said not to worry and that the kitchen wasn't done being put away so take a moment.   Right away, my eyes fell onto the word \"Cabo.\" What can I say? My last trip to Mexico was very good to me. Cabo Tacos it was! My colleague ordered 3 different tacos and we both ordered the horchata.   Now, this is where you may say that we were so damn hungry and that saying this was the BEST Mexican food we have EVER had is an overstatement but no, it's not. We both lived in California previously and we are both well-traveled. This was the bombest of the bomb. Is that a phrase? Better than any food I had my whole time in Cabo, too.   The Cabo Tacos were fried lightly, fresh, and piping hot. The slaw was perfectly crispy and cool. The tortillas were soft. The rice...oh my god...the rice...If Heaven is just clouds of this rice...I'm down with it.   The salsa bar didn't have as many options left at 11 PM, understandably so, but what was left, was great. There was a peanut sauce and radish sauce that still stick out in my head. I wish I could have had them both bottled up and shipped to me.   Anyways, WHAT NICE FREAKING PEOPLE. They let us sit down at 10:58 PM and happily served us food, waited to clean the salsa bar until they saw we didn't need/want anymore, and gave us the biggest freaking horchatas in a to-go cup. The horchata had a bunch of fruit in it. I've never seen it or tasted it like that before. Magic. Better than tequila. That's a bold statement coming from me...  I love you chef, bus boy, and boss man. I love you and I miss you and I love you and I miss your food.",

There is a salsa bar, but when I got there - around dinner time - the salsas were mostly gone. There are at least two salsas worth writing about, but there were no cups/lids to take the salsa with me. Upon request, they provided me four one-ounce cups with four lids, so I did get to try a bit of four types of salsa, period. The fish tacos were odd, but the smoked swordfish actually tasted yum. NOT for $9+ though, which is part of the reason for the low star review. Overall, you couldn't convince me to give this place a second try. Bad service - the servers/staff seemed too busy to help (service is a biggie). Recommend you go into the insurance business with your people skills.",

We ordered an horchata, which was pretty good (but then again I've never had one before so... no comparison there). We ordered the mix and match tacos and all I can say is I don't ever want to try mexican food again. I'm cuban, so I know about flavor and good hispanic cooking, but these were not blah! There was no flavor, out of the 3 mini tacos I ordered the only one with SOME flavor was a chicken one that was loaded with onions and spicy sauce. So you can guess, it simply tasted spicy. Overall, if you find another place with good reviews go there. I thought this place would be great due to the 1000+ reviews and the 4.5 rating, but I was greatly disappointed and ended up paying $40 for 6 mediocre, small tacos and a drink!",

Lots of unique flavors and it is clean and well presented. The chef/cook came out to check on orders so i think they care but the price does not justify the food....",

    "text": "This place is awesome, and I am deciding is my favorite Mexican food restaurant (restaurants-both locations are pretty much the same) in the Phoenix area. I have eaten here (and at the Glendale location) a total of 4 times, and each experience has left me wanting to come back.   The salsa bar is the best I've experienced with an amazing variety of tastes, fresh ingredients, and mild to moderate spice. Order extra chips straight away if you love chips and salsa.  The food is outstanding-from their pibil to their arbol, to their beans and rice. They use very high quality fresh ingredients with KILLER flavor and spice. While there is a very strong Mexican feel to the restaurants (no gringo influence that I noticed-Thank you), there is also a modern feel to their menu. So I've started out with the more popular dishes/recipes, but I am excited to try out some of their other offerings that appear more modern.  Their margaritas (I've only had the house) are the best, period. End of sentence.  Finally, you should be aware that the physical spaces are pretty different. I'm going to guess the owners are young and without the resources to afford something more expensive. But don't be put off by the space. I love that they have more modern art, and the food more than makes up for any misgivings one might have about the space.  If you really love Amazing Mexican food, you must try this place. I can't imagine you will be disappointed.  PS, I don't think their prices are reasonable/not expensive.",

The taco meal for $9 came with 2 small tacos, and a thimble full of beans and a similar amount of rice. On a piece of paper in a plastic tray. You have to get your own plastic utensils and napkins...which I dont mind, just not at these prices. The famous salsa bar was half empty and I had to ask for forks as they had run out.

    "text": "My friend and I stopped in here after a day of shopping and it was nearby.  The reviews on  yelp made us stop by.  The three stars are really based on the quality of the food and the location of the restaurant to me.    The food quality was good, but didn't knock my socks off.  I can get just as good tacos elsewhere in the valley. - Two taco plate ($9) - had two different kind of tacos, with two tortillas per taco type, rice and beans.  I had the smoked marlin, which I tasted more of the salsa than the marlin...  and the Sonoran carne asada tacos which were yummy but I've had better elsewhere. - I also wanted to try the el pastor street tacos ($3 for two tortillas).  They were yummy but sadly I had Rocky Point on the top of my mind and I remember getting better there....  -My friend got a chicken deep friend quesas that had peppers and onions in it.  It was very yummy and a large portion but very rich.  The restaurant was cute, but small.  Luckily it was just the two of us because a large group would be too much. The menu was extensive, it was hard to make a decision. There were tons of salsas to try and a free basket of chips when we sat down, so it was fun to try all the different salsas.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive, I really did like my lunch there but I wouldn't call myself a \"fan\".  It was good though, and if I happen to be in the area (which is very rare) I would stop in.",

From your classic pico, to pecan, strawberry, and the popular cilantro-cream, plus many more. Emphasis on the pecan because sweet jesus that stuff is so good.   Refreshing Jamaica? Check. Sweet, milky horchata with nuts & fruit? Check.   Lots of variety. The Mahi Mahi tacos, the Sonoran carne, the Dogfish, the Cabo shrimp - all of them are incredibly delicious. They do seafood very well here; never over or undercooked, and usually served up with fresh cabbage and drizzled with mayo, mole, or what have you. The rice is also excellent - always tender and perfectly seasoned. The Bullet burro (beans & cheese) is also pretty good, especially when you smother it in their fresh cilantro salsa.   I've noticed some people saying they wish it was located in downtown-downtown Phoenix (what they really mean is gentrified), but I disagree. I like the location, especially because it's nestled in on the same street with other less \"hip\" mom & pop shops. It has a great neighborhood vibe - very comfortable.    Put simply, I love this place. If you haven't tried it, you're missing out.",

We brought a friend here from NY ranting and raving about the food the whole way. When we arrived we were quickly embarrassed as the entire staff treated us as if we were invisible. We stood by the \"please wait to be seated\" sign for almost 10 min. as the staff worked hard to not make eye contact with us. We ultimately had to ask the busser if there was a host. Half the restaurant was empty. They easily could have acknowledged us, sat us, offered chips and told us the kitchen was behind. Instead they chose to completely ignore us making us feel as if they wanted us to just turn around and walk out. We took the hint and went to Pepe's Taco Villa where they made us feel at home.",

Really, the only negative was the cramped quarters.  My second visit, however, was not nearly as good. On the positive side, I got guacamole this time which was studded with dried cranberries and tasted great with the strawberry salsa. I was impressed with the service too because my friend's order came out the same time as mine despite the fact that we ordered separately 10 minutes apart.   The tacos this time were awful. I decided to get the vegan tacos since the description of \"no pintos, no rice\" lead me to believe that the beans and rice in the veggie tacos weren't really vegetarian friendly. I'm a pretty strict vegetarian so I try to avoid food that's been prepared with meat-based stock. The vegan tacos come with black beans which were absolutely flavorless. I'm not sure these beans encountered even a grain of salt during their preparation. The tacos also had iceburg lettuce in them which tasted dreadful of course.   So now I know I can't have their veggie tacos, and the vegan ones suck. No reason to visit again.",

Food was on point, even a few options for vegetarians! Good sized portions, not overly pricey. Love having the salsa bar there!! The jicama drink was similar to a berry juice, was a little too sweet for my liking but once it was watered down a little, it was delicious. Will definitely come back here next time!",

Came on a Sunday not really busy at al , took them 40 mins for us to get a table when I could l see open tables ( more then 3) . Then when we sat down it took over an hour to get our food . The food was good nothing bad to say about the food . Just the service. The Glendale location was so much better . I will never come here again , I will drive out of my way to Glendale next time .",

The service was great - we were immediately greeted and our drink orders taken right away. We both ordered the horchata - wow! Such a delicious twist to the already yummy drink. I ordered the mole quesadilla and my husband had a pastor bowl, both delicious, seasoned perfectly and pretty darn close to being authentic Mexican food. This place is a must - parking is limited as is the seating space inside, but worth it. I'll be back!",

We waited about 40 minutes for our food!! The steak tacos were disgusting!! The beer was hot!! My son only had couple of bites of his burrito!! And he can eat!!

Could be due to the limited seating or maybe because the food is terrific. Both? Likely. Chips arrived promptly straight from the oil pan - nice and toasty. And we helped ourselves to the salsa bar - which is completely fresh, creative, and whets your palette at the get-go! We loved the cilantro salsa and salsa mexicana the best. Zesty! The servers were quick to take our order despite being busy and minutes later my tacos de arrachera arrived. Sooo good! I mean. Wow! Meat was tender and juicy ....and the combination of spices and flavors was heaven. My friend ordered the Condesa specialty taco. Another winning ticket! Condesa has nailed the right way to make beans too. And..don't get me started on the deliciousness of the horchata. I've had me some horchata many places ..but this really rocked my world. Rocked it!   Condesa, I have just two requests: Please do something about the sitting area so we can actually fit in this place. Also, please don't be out of flan next time I come in! Thanks!",

When we got our stale store-bought, rubbery chips the salsa wasn't so appealing after all. We both ordered chicken burritos and were shocked when we got a basket with a tortilla filled with soggy chicken bits and bean soup. It wasn't possible to use a fork and knife in a basket so we tried to pick them up and the burritos spilled all over our hands. It was a mess! I asked the waitress to look at the menu again because we were not satisfied with the burritos. I hate to waste food but we could not force ourselves to eat them. She said we had to pay for the burritos and then she would give us \"one\" taco. She made us feel very uncomfortable as she waved her \"one\" finger in our faces so I told her we would pay for the food and then look at the menu again. She immediately brought me the check and waited over my shoulder for me to pay for it before she handed us the menus. Her angry attitude scared us, so we no longer wanted to look at the menu. We just wanted to leave and try out another restaurant. I would not recommend dining at this place. The quality of food was horrible and the service was even worse. Waitress with vile attitude and crappy food equals a no win situation. You're better off dining at Taco Bell.",

The quesa is like a jumbo empanada  made with corn flour dough then deep fried. We ordered it at the waitress recommendation.  I'm sure the soft corn flour dough makes it very hard to stay together during the frying process however the creation is way too doughy and heavy, with little filling. Nobody ordered burritos. If we come back again, I'd definitely recommend my friends/family to stay with the tacos.",

Love the fresh fruit and nuts in it. The salsa bar is a tastebud orgy of sheer delight and a playground for foodies who love complexity of flavor. But best of all... for 2 tacos, a little side of rice and beans, chips, two BIG drinks, it was only $16! Plus, we listened to The Smiths and old Mexican folk music. This place rocks. Oh, and for those reviewers who were frightened by the neighborhood, get over it. I live 5 blocks in a historic neighborhood and it is as safe as a city can get. If you come for lunch, you just might take a walk a couple blocks up to get a poleta for desert. 16th st between McDowell and Thomas has successfully embraced its roots to create a truly positive cultural experience.",

La Condesa isn't far from our house, and I've been wanting to try it, so we went there.  The food was amazing!  Even my mom - who is the pickiest eater I know - liked it!  The different salsas at the bar are great, and the food is delicious.",

    "text": "I, unfortunately, rarely make it out to this part of town. When I do, I tend to go an binges, scarfing down food from one or two of my favorite spots, and adding a new place that has been on my must-try list. This time, it was La Condesa.   Everything about La Condesa took me by surprise, regardless of the high expectations I already had. I loved its interior--the small space, the rustic wood furniture, the artwork, everything. A big departure from the usual feel of cheap-mexican restaurants/taquerias, it felt homey, warm, inviting. I was expecting to just shoot a quick order to the girl at the counter, but instead got table service, and extremely friendly and attentive service to boot (sounds like it's usually an order-at-the-counter place, though).   On to the food: don't expect the usual suspects at the salsa bar--these salsas and toppings were phenomenal. I didn't ask, but I suspect they were all made in-house, and seemed incredibly fresh and were really a unique assortment. A great mellow, nutty peanut sauce, smokey chipotle salsa, creamy/salty cilantro, an awesome Mexican (or was it Mayan?) salsa (my favorite of what I tried)...my only regret was not sampling more.  What I loved about the menu were the unique options that branched far beyond the usual suspects. I went with three tacos: tinga, mole, cochinita pibil. When they arrived, all of them looked beautiful, and were surprisingly and thankfully chocked-full of meat. I took one bite of the mole and...HO...LY.....SHIT. Ever go to a restaurant and casually take a bite of something without giving it too much thought, only to be immediately punched in the face by its deliciousness? I love it when this happens. It's one of those pure joys in life, and happens far too infrequently...but it happened here. I'm a sucker for any type of mole, but sometimes they fall a bit 'flat'. This one did not. It had a fantastic bite and complexity to it that really elevated the mole to one of the best I've had. The tinga and cochinita were both equally great. The meat in all three was insanely tender and flavorful from the great sauces they had simmered in.  I paid the bill--$9.80--and realized that it was an awesome deal. Sure, you can find tacos in town for less than $3/ea, but they will not be like these. Not to mention, the portions were generous, I got free chips and a run at the salsa bar.   I drove home feeling like I was teetering on the edge of purging...this was, after all, my second substantial meal in the course of 1 hour. But it was well worth it. Adding yet another spot to my list of places I have to hit when in the area. Already searching for an excuse.",

    "text": "I read all the great reviews on here and in the 'Phoenix's 23 of the Valleys best new places to chow down' and was excited - both my sister and I love street tacos. Maybe I missed something, but I have never been more dissappointed in my culinary adventures. The chips were alright...the array of salsas was impressive and all the ones I sampled were quite good. We ordered 5 different tacos a la carte - Cabo Shrimp Taco, Sonoran Carne Asada Taco, Aztec Tinga Taco, Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, La Condesa Shrimp taco.  The Cabo was tasty, but nothing to write home about, the carne asada was tasteless and overdone, the Aztec Tinga was not bad... but very one note and we were over it after the first bite. The Condesa Shrimp taco had  WAAAY too much garlic and the shrimp had zero flavor - I came across at least 10 full slices and I still have the taste of garlic in my mouth hours later.  Overall it wasn't horrible - it just wasn't good - definately not 25 dollars worth -  this is not a place I would return to nor would I recommend it to anyone else If you want good street tacos see my reviews.",

    "text": "Stopped in on Saturday for lunch. Place was dead, only one other couple in the restaurant. Noticed speakers on the wall, but no music was playing. Not exactly a jovial atmosphere for a wonderful spring day in March. I ordered the Carne Asada and a Cochinita Pibil to be washed down with an Horchata. I then proceeded to the Salsa bar which appeared to have an outstanding selection and I immediately started filling cups with the many varietals eagerly anticipating being able to dress up my tacos. Chips were then brought out to snack on while I waited for my food. I can only describe these as cold, flavorless, and typical of most chain restaurant chips. Not a good sign. My Taco's arrived shortly thereafter. Unfortunately these too were nothing to write home about. The tortillas were cold and appeared store bought. The carne asada was overcooked and lacked any form of flavor. I attempted to spice things up by adding salsas, but these too were flavorless. Very little spice and hardly any seasoning. The cochinita pibil was enjoyable, as it was juicy and tasted like a quality cut of pork, but wrapped inside of a cold store bought tortilla the experience was muted.   I highly doubt I will be returning to this restaurant, and I honestly question those that have written such outstanding reviews. My opinion, no taco shop should bill itself as \"Gourmet\" if it does not make its own tortillas, has bland salsas, and cannot make a juicy and flavorful carne asada.",

The waitress was so on top of things, and made sure that everyone had drinks (relatively) quickly, and always had full water glasses. (I say relatively because one margarita took a while and it took a few tries to get my coke, but again, we were a party of 10, so it wasn't a big deal).   While we waited for our food, we sampled the salsa bar, which has 16 flavors of salsa. The waitress brought baskets of chips as soon as we sat down. Each one tasted so different, and while we didn't love all of them, we had so much fun sampling and comparing the different flavors.   I had the fish tacos, which were awesome. Everyone on yelp raves about them, and they were totally right. So flavorful and the tortilla held up well. I also had a quesadilla - most places make their quesadillas with flour tortillas, so I was ecstatic to see that they made theirs with corn (extra points for being gluten-free-friendly!). They let me sub out the pork for the steak, and the quesadilla did not disappoint - stuffed with cheese, steak, and some veggies, this this was awesome.   Wish I didn't live so far, because I would absolutely become a regular here.   Good for: cheap dinner, night out with friends, date night, any time you're feeling hungry!",

My bigger issue is how the act towards or treat customers. Below are a couple of lines I heard today a lone \"you're going to have to wait at least 30 minutes, if you want to wait\", almost seemed like they didn't want me to to stick around. When I sat at the bar which is supposed to be first come first served, I asked for a drink as I waited for my table. \"Everything is first come first served, so you're going to have to wait for that too\" is the answer I received. For a drink?   Overall this was a strange and disappointing experience, and it was the second time something like this has happened. I really enjoyed their food, which makes it more disappointing that I likely will not be coming back.",

The thing that stands out here is the salsa bar with the different varieties of salsa to choose from. Fresh and home made with a great opportunity to experiment and sample all kinds.  Very small place with old tables and dawn of the dead motif if that is your thing. Service is good but they dont have much to do with you. The parking is limited and may need to park along a side street.  You order at the counter and they bring the food to you. Simple and easy  Recommend to try their tacos if you want real tacos and something different",

Once you walk in, you quickly realize the noise level because of the way the place is constructed and set up is very high. Last but not the least, the service is always poor. We had rude servers where we walked out without ordering one time. That is the reason for 3 stars.",

It's a tiny little hole in the wall place that has about 10 tables. It can get kind of cramped but it is definitely worth it when that food hits your tongue. This place has the best mexican food! The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of how tiny it is and the fact that you have to pay $2.40 to get extra chips. Aside from this, this place is awesome!",

The guac is something special and different.  See the photo. The pork shoulder and steak w/chimichurri sauce were amazing, even the simple rice side was great. I did like the steak taco better than the pork but the favors were very different.  The salsabar was a real treat!  So many things to try. Will be back next time in town.",

Inspired by the flavors and ingredients of Mexico, you can explore a variety of meals I've already fallen in love with. As you can expect, all ingredients are fresh and flavorful. One of the key things that sets this taco establishment from other larger brand competitors is that they try their best to help you forget about unhealthy, heavy, greasy style Mexican food you've had in America. It's time you experience what actual Mexican food is all about and perhaps you'll never go back to the rest. Popular items such as Quesadillas, Tacos and Burritos come to life with the help of fresh green tomatillos, Oaxacan cheeses, chipotle chiles, flour and corn tortillas. Other amazing things to try include the Horchata beverage, Carne Asada, Baja Sur Shark Tacos and more.",

From mild, to smoky, to hot, there's a peanut and pecan salsa, jicama, guacamole, Pico de gallo, and several more.         2. Great menu choices, not your typical American/Mexican options.          3. The street tacos! !! We chose Al Pastor,  Carne Asada, y Cochinita Pibil with rice and beans. Uhhhhh-mazing!    From a white girl who used to never eat Mexican, who is now married to a Mexican..... I was totally impressed. My husband said 4 stars, because he's got a picky palette.  Thoroughly enjoyed my meal!

I literally had to dig into my memory to remember what I even ate here because I was so amazed by the salsa bar. I literally got up and filled containers nonstop with EVERY single salsa (no shame). I didn't let that go to waste, I tried them all and left little behind. Of course, I loved the spicier selections, but everything was amazing. After eating so much salsa, my pastor burrito came and was pretty good. I think it was a little dry, but nothing salsa can't fix. I tried some of Eric's shark taco and carne asada taco, those were really good! Next time I think I'm going to give a carne asada quesadilla a try! The beans were also great and I must say I left full and satisfied!  Can't wait to come back!",

The house margarita has a lovely blend of lime and grapefruit juices and it just plain delicious.  There are tons of veggie options here that are not just lame, meatless dishes.  The La Condessa Veggie Taco has a mix of Oaxacan cheese, mushrooms, smoky poblano peppers, onion, spinach and garlic...and it is to die for.  The all-you-can-eat salsa bar adds a fun touch.",

So taco Tuesday right?my mom doesn't let me go out often unless it was prom or some sort of social gathering...but she's on vacation in Dubai, and I wanted to feel dangerous so I decided to take my chick to the hood and found La Santissima.   The neighborhood that the restaurant is located in gave me a sense of impending danger and my girlfriend say she's into bad boys so I think I turned her on when We came into this joint.   The food was OK. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just Mexican food, you know?  Walking out of this restaurant, I feel like a man for once in my life. I took a selfie with La Santissima in the background and sent it to my friends.   When I was walking to my car a homeless person slapped the glasses out of my face...I mean I didn't need them to see, those were sunglasses. I probably shouldn't have worn them at night anyway. I just wanted to be cool and also I wanted to call the police but I sensed some heat coming from between my girlfriends legs so we ended up making out in the parking lot next to the shipping container. Nice placement.",

They also have a really good Horchata that is super unique and a little expensive, but it has real nuts and fruit in it that makes it special.  I love bringing friends from out of state here!  Although this place is not in a very safe-looking area, when you walk in it looks very clean and comfortable.  The decor inside is very unique and artistic.  Even the bathroom alone has unique paintings.  I highly recommend this place!",

They do have a large salsa bar with lots of interesting flavors, but I wish they would get rid of some of the unpopular flavors and focus on the good ones that always seem to run out.   Also the guacamole and horchata are fantastic, but not as good as when they first opened.   I'll be back....",

    "text": "The good: The tacos here are amazing. Best I've ever had? No. But enjoyable, if pricey. I had the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco and the La Condesa Veggie Taco. The pork taco was tasty, though extremely messy; the onion pieces were huge, but weirdly enough they had no flavor at all. My favorite was the veggie taco. The vegetable variety was great and they were all cooked to perfection--crisp but fully cooked. The cheese on top was like the glue (best glue ever!) and had a lovely salty tang.  My husband had the pork taco as well and also the Sonoran Carne Asada Taco. The steak taco was his definite favorite; he thought the pork chunks were way too big.  Our server was good--much better than when I visited the Glendale location by myself and was ignored.  The bad: Yes, the salsa bar is great, but the restaurant is so crowded that it makes getting the salsa difficult. The restaurant is downright claustrophobic, and it wasn't even fully packed with customers when we were there. We wanted to finish our food and leave ASAP so we could stretch out and breathe. There's not a great deal of parking, either.  The tacos are served in baskets lined with tissue paper. With really messy tacos, that means the paper disintegrates and you can't easily cut big chunks of meat with a knife.  Really, it's a place with great tacos and a horrid location. We won't visit again.",

Loved the salsa bar (the pecan, surprisingly, was my favorite) and we both got different versions of their quesadillas. She got the pork pastor and I got the chicken mole. Both were outstanding and different than anything else we've had.   They hand make their own corn tortillas, fill them with cheese and your filling of choice, and then deep fry them. This gave them a crisp outer shell but a light and almost creamy masa interior. So good!    FYI - the neighborhood seemed a little questionable (lots of bars on the Windows) but we went during the day and felt perfectly safe. The place was bumping with other happy diners and we'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "It's Monday, people! What are you all doing here?  That's what I wanted to scream as I asked the gentleman at the bar how long the wait was.  There aren't that many tables stuffed into this small establishment, but apparently they really are that good that people are willing to waste time that they will never get back, to eat here.  So, I stepped outside and summarily informed my wife as to the long wait. I also reminded her that the other places she chose the past two days had prolonged delays for seating. I felt like I had lost precious moments in my life waiting to eat. On the upside, I was spending time with the only person that matters, so it was not even remotely a total loss in time. I was simply exaggerating.  So we waited outside, and tried to engage all the other customers. But, everyone was agitated for having to wait, and no one was wanting to engage in random conversation. In fact, the leaders of each party kept going back inside asking how much longer they would have to wait. I thought it was funny because we were all blocking the front entrance and we would've seen anyone that would've left. So, why bother asking how much longer? Duh!  I also thought how funny it was when a couple would leave, and the groups would go back inside and check in. Lemme do some basic math for you, okay? 2 people leave, and there are 10 of all you all! How many seats do you think will be available? :)  So, I go inside (not to ask how much longer), but I grabbed a menu (why waste time waiting in line and not be prepared), and I commandeer the only remaining flan in the house. I go back outside, and I tell my wife that I reserved the flan. She was a little perturbed because she didn't think I could do that! Well, everyone else is harassing the 2 servers (and one of them is pregnant), and I was just being polite and proactive. I kindly asked if I could have the last flan, and the gentleman set it aside for me.  So, about 50 minutes into the long wait, we finally get a seat. I must say, we really did experience how small this place was because as mobility was definitely impaired when you eat here. There is no chance that you won't bump into ANYONE!   Let's get to the food part. The variety of Salsa that this place offers is amazing. Their unique flavors, and various combinations thereof are fantastic. You can mix and match them, and they just make you that much hungrier with every bite.   We had the Sonora Carne Asada Burro and the Street Tacos. Additionally, we also had the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken Quesa.   The verdict? Definitely worth the wait. The meats and the sauces were just phenomenal. Each and every bite was wonderful.  Then for the finale, I had my flan. By that time, everyone in our original group was seated and were still in various stages of being served with either drinks or their food orders being taken.  When the pregnant server lady brought out our flan, EVERYONE looked at it with envy as it really was a delicious masterpiece. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Then everyone wanted to order it, but alas, they all found out that I ordered the last one!!! (Evil eyes across the room)  More evil eyes came because I quickly learned how to multitask the server lady. While she was getting our flan, I went ahead and gave her my CC, asked for boxes for our leftovers, and also asked for refills.  So, while she was gone for quite some time preparing our flan, she left the only other server to take care of everyone else. When she returned, she had our box, our refills, our flan, and our check all done.  All we had to do was enjoy the flan, drink our refills, box up our leftovers, and sign the check / fill out her tip.   And we walked out of there, while everyone was still wondering how to get served in here.  A few things that may detract from future experiences that you may want to be aware of. There is minimal parking, so you have to park on the side street but don't block the homes. The wait is long, and the service is slow unless you learn how to stack your requests so they get stuff done in one trip.  Otherwise, what a wonderful dining experience, even for a Monday night!  (Gosh, how I missed it when Monday Night Football was going on. I never had to endure this during those times)",

I got a lot of different tacos but couldn't decide on a favorite. They also offer other foods as well. We went for a business lunch which was great. Atmosphere was nice, not too loud. The cheese dip appetizer is really good.",

Taste is king and I didn't think any of my 4 different tacos was striking.  Not a bad dining experience at all, just not amazing.    Ambience, service, etc were all great.  Perhaps others will find it more amazing.  Maybe I would try a burrito next time?",

Both were very good, but I did prefer the Shark Taco. I also had their horchata which was just okay...it had too much cinnamon for me, but I like the addition of fruits and nuts with it.

Great expansion because i did feel in the past that this restaurant was rather cramped. We arrived at the door noticing at least 5-6 empty tables and room at the bar. We were greeted by a young hostess who stated that she was not allowed to leave anyone in because the waitresses/waiters were too busy and she did not have enought menus for everyone. We asked if we could sit at the bar and drink water until they were ready. We did state that we drove 45 minutes to get here. She stated that it might be anywhere from 40 min to 1 hour wait. My frustration with this whole scenario was that there were plenty of tables open and we were not allowed to sit down. Why expand a restaurant if you cant staff it correctly and get enough menus for each seating space in the restaurant. I will never visit this restaurant again based on this experience.",

I ordered an horchata, a cochinita pibil taco, a shark taco, a smoked mahi mahi taco, guacamole, and also tried the al pastor taco, and pollo asada taco.  (I didn't order this all on my own.  I had a group of four and we shared.)  The decor is dope and makes you feel like you are about to have a great taco experience.  The horchata is 5/5 hands down the best horchata you will have in your life.  I'm talking nuts, strawberries, cantaloupe, cinnamon, and more.  Devine.  The shark taco is boring.  Not much flavor at all and needs lots of salsa to give it some taste.  The cochinita pibil is 5/5.  Tasty, mouth watering, juicy, flavorful.  Excellent.  The smoked mahi had some nice flavors but was lacking on meat big time.  The guac was average.  They put fruit in it and pomegranates to try to kick it up and be creative but it didn't quite come together.  It needs some more work.  The al pastor was very disappointing.  I am a huge al pastor fan and this was poorly done.  Dry, lacking flavor, very boring.  The pollo asada was exactly the same as the pastor.  Boring and dry.  The beans and rice were above average.  Nice flavor, moist, and good texture.  They also changed out the tortillas and now have dry boring corn rather than the awesome soft ones I had before.    I stand by my opinion on the salsas as I had on my first experience.  It's cool to have 20 options but only four of them are worth your time.  Two of the reds, and two of the greens.  Sesame salsa?  Peanut salsa?  I tried them all.  No thanks.  It's obvious this place is knocking it out of the park.  It is very trendy, always packed, and holds over a few hundred reviews.  If you go and you probably should. Mark my words.  Order the horchata, two cochinita pibil tacos, and stock up on the traditional salsas.",

So here goes...  La Condesa was excellent.  From the moment we entered through the heavy spanish doorway, to the smart and humble decor - we knew we had found something unique.    Our server was polite, engaging, and insightful.  We've been searching for the ultimate Baja-style Fish Taco so we chose a-la-carte tacos this time and will return later for the full meal.  What we did experience this time was a dream come True in the land-locked state of Arizona.  The two pieces of fish in each taco were huge, hot, and crispy, wrapped in a light corn tortilla with a liberal covering of cabbage and white sauce.  With the first bite I was instantly taken back to memories of lounging beach-side in Mexico, or more recently the taco shops of Southern California.  My second and continued bites were adjusted to new heights of flavor with the plethora of home-made salsas available.  I can't wait to return and plan to bring friends!  Troy.",

    "text": "Tasty tacos, great decor, pretty mediocre service.  Setting: I was pretty excited to try out this place, because I'm a fool for good tacos. This place definitely stands out in its neighborhood--the facade does a great job of making it do so. The inside has a great-looking bar area, the artwork is really nice (I dig the Dia de los Muertos theme), and the furniture is nice and colorful. It's a cozy little place, with tables very close to each other to fit in as many as possible in a relatively small area.  Food: The food is pretty excellent. I ended up trying 4 different tacos during my visit, and they were all very good. I tried the Mayan Cochinita Pibil, La Condesa Veggie Taco, the whitefish taco, and the Gaucho taco. I was most excited about the cochinita pibil, because it's one of my favorite dishes, but I ended up being most impressed by the gaucho taco. The steak in it was very well done, and the flavors went well with each other. I could have used some more chimichurri, but it was tasty nonetheless. The cochinita pibil was very good as well. The whitefish taco was a little bland. I wouldn't have minded some stronger flavors in it. And the veggie taco was quite good--right up there with the cochinita pibil. The rice and beans, though not the star of the show, were really good! I liked that the rice was a little \"stickier\" than most rice you find outside of more Asian-type restaurants. And the beans had great flavor.  When I first opened the menu, I was very conflicted over what to order. There are so many great options! I'll definitely have to come back and sample some of the other options. The salsa bar is pretty great. There is a good range of selections, including a few options I had never seen before (e.g., strawberry salsa and pecan salsa).  Service: This was definitely the downside to the experience. Despite there being nobody in front of me waiting for a table when I arrived, it took about 30 minutes of waiting to get a table. Seeing as there is nowhere inside to wait, that's a long wait in the Phoenix summer heat. Once seated, it took a further 15 minutes for anybody to come over and ask for my order. And once I had finished, I sat there for about 30 minutes before I had an opportunity to request our check. Fortunately, I wasn't in any sort of hurry, but that's a lot of waiting.  All in all, I enjoyed the experience and will be back. It's a little pricey for tacos, but the ingredients generally merit a price higher than your typical taco stand.",

    "text": "We drove from Mesa & it didn't take too long on a Sunday afternoon. It was our first time so we parked right off of 16th Ave. but I would not recommend it because backing out is dangerous due to limited visibility.  Atmosphere: There were paintings on every wall. Most of them are themed after Dia de los Muertos--the Day of the Dead which is the restaurant's theme. There was a small bar with about 4 bar stools. I would say maximum seating capacity is about 35 because & that is packing every table full & there is barely any room to scoot your chair out to walk around. The muzak reminded me of Jamaican music but my husband said it sounded \"chips & salsa\" music to him. lol  Food: My daughters are picky & do not enjoy spicy food. Both of the enjoyed the burrito, the orig. quesadilla & the rice. The cheese was unique & flavorful. I am 42 & don't remember ever having eaten it before. Here is a bit about it (Oaxaca cheese  is a white, semi-hard cheese from Mexico, similar to unaged Monterey Jack, but with a mozzarella-like string cheese texture. It is named after the state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico, where it was first made) y husband said the 3 street tacos he ordered were DELISIOCO. In other words, if it had been served on a plate that was sitting on the floor he still would have eaten them. We also enjoyed the Mexican Coke & strawberry soda while my husband had a Corona with lime. For dessert we shared a slice of Tres Leche Cake (4 ways) which was topped with a bit of whipped cream, drizzled with caramel sauce & pieces of pecan.   Overall: The food was very good but I felt bad for them & the customers who left because there was nowhere to sit. I suggest they do what they can to buy out the business adjacent to them & knock out the wall to expand at their current address or, better yet (unless they have other parking I don't know about) relocate to a building with more parking & tables.",

I seen a signed picture of Chef Guy that was signed for diners,drive inn ,and dives; from 2 years sago. I wonder with all the business that they have seen why not expand? But anywhoo, everything was great I just don't like feeling rushed due to others coming in, starring waiting for a table.",

Maybe the best part of the experience is loading up on the salsas from the salsa bar and going to town on warm chips. (My favorite is the peanut salsa).   They are also really are proud of the chocolate mole which is very unique and something I have not seen at other shops. They mole is great, very flavorful, but also very intense, so make sure you want a hardy meal before ordering a dish with it! Parking can be tight, especially if you come during the lunch hour as there are only a handful of spots outside the building.",

    "text": "I have to say, I thought it may have been a pipe dream to think that because Phoenix is closer to the Mexican border that we may be able to find better Mexican restaurants here. But the theory proved True. I'm from Minneapolis, where good Mexican places are few and far between, the only good one I can think of being Los Ocampo.   This place had the best salsa bar I've seen yet. The steak tacos I had were excellent; the meat was moist and flavorful with no gristle and little fat. They would have been even better with a little cilantro though. The rice and beans were some of the best I've had; the rice was a tad soft/wet but the flavor was spot on. We had margaritas, apparently on special, for only $3 a pop. They were tasty but strong enough-enough that I had to let my husband finish mine off because I was driving. The only thing I would say needs improvement is the ambiance; my chair was uncomfortable and difficult to scoot in and out from the table, which was a big pain and drew attention to us when I attempted to nurse our baby. The chairs could use reupholstering too.  Tip: their parking is out front but easy to miss when you're driving down 16th, which is a busy thoroughfare with a speed limit of 45 (?) don't quote me on that but people drive FAST.",

SO glad we decided to drive the extra 20 minutes to get there (despite being surrounded by restaurants at the mall).   This place is good for vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters alike.  I chose the Ghandi and the veggie tacos (cactus), while my friend had meaty street tacos. The food was fresh & delicious and the portion size was perfect.    Loved the salsa bar!!  Other reviewers mentioned the dried cranberries in the guacamole. It was a delicious sweet addition and the guac was perfect!

The food is made fresh and it shows.  The refried beans were delicious, really creamy, and flavorful. The rice was not dry and also way above average in taste.  The Asada was so flavorful and tender. Definitely better than most places I frequent. The beef was not chewy at all and has an almost melt in your mouth consistency.  The Al Pastor was also amazing with all fresh ingredients including the pineapple.  If you're in the Coronado area, do yourself a favor and check out this little gem!",

    "text": "La Santisima's been in my bookmark list for some time. I had heard a lot of good things about it and their menu had some items you don't often see such as cochinita pibil and chile en nogada. We got here around brunch time and I decided on the black mole chilaquiles. I love mole and I also love chilaquiles so the combo sounded perfect. The chilaquiles come with your choice of \"traditional vegetable,\" egg, or options for meat such as chicken. I asked the server what vegetables came with the vegetable chilaquiles but there seemed to be a language barrier; he didn't really understand what I was asking him, only saying yes there are vegetables and when I asked again, that it was a popular choice.  When we arrived we were seated promptly by the hostess but it took quite a bit of time for a server to come over and take our orders. So, we had plenty of time (Plenty....) to take in the atmosphere. I love the Dia de Los Muertos theme of the restaurant and the paintings of la Catrina were stunning. We also indulged in the salsa bar which had a plethora of unique options such as sesame, pecan, and peanut salsa. While I appreciate all the variety, most of the salsas to me were just so-so. Either they were too one-dimensional in taste or had an overpowering flavor that was a turn off for me. My favorite of all the ones I tried was the pecan salsa. I normally don't like creamy salsas but I liked the nuanced, nutty flavor combined with rich smooth creaminess. One suggestion would be to list the heat level for all the salsas since some were a lot hotter than others (I think the peanut was the most spicy of the bunch I tried).  Getting our dishes also took quite a bit of time. There was only one other table (A 4-top) that had ordered ahead of us and our meals weren't really that complicated to make. When I received my dish, it looked nice but when I looked at the ingredients I thought, \"This is it?\" It was a handful of chips, a ton of mole sauce, a small sprinkling of melted cheese and a small portion of black beans. As for the \"traditional vegetables\", I received a laughable amount of the tiniest pieces of avocado (2 pieces not quite the size of a pinkie finger), and about 4 slivers of red onion. Are they really hurting for money that much they can't spare me more onion at least? Or at least a regular sized piece of avocado? If I had known there was so little in this dish I might have spruced it up by upgrading to adding an egg or chicken. The taste itself was OK. I did enjoy the complex flavors of the mole sauce and the chips tasted good but after a while the dish really needed some extra forms of vegetable (Or bigger portions of them) to balance out all the deep, earthier flavors. The chilaquiles came with 2 buttered slices of baguette which I thought was weird. I've never had crusty bread with chilaquiles before. They tasted good at least.  I did take a bite of another breakfast dish, one with chorizo, hash browns, beans and egg. That one was a huge portion and a lot better.  While I did enjoy the ambiance, my dish was not worth the amount of money I paid for it. Add to that the painfully slow service when it wasn't even that busy I would probably visit another Mexican restaurant in this area over this one.",

    "text": "Man, I've never given such a low review... where do I start? So I get an hour long lunch everyday. I work extremely close to La Santisma, so I figured that this would be a great place to check out and that I'd have plenty of time to sit down and enjoy my food. Wrong.  I showed up with a coworker around 2:30pm. There were maybe 18 other customers MAX in the restaurant. It took about 15 minutes for us to get cups of water and it took 30-35 minutes for someone to take our order. And had I not approached a waitress requesting to have our orders taken, it probably would've taken longer. There were plenty of waiters and waitresses standing around, chatting. Customers that came in after us were served before us.  The menu is huge. There is SO much to choose from. This is a huge plus! It's a little overwhelming but I LOVE variety. I couldn't decide so I asked the waitress to tell me what the spiciest burrito on the menu was. I ended up requesting the Mayan burro.  While we were waiting for our food to arrive, we checked out the awesome salsa bar. I LOVE salsa and tried every single one of their options. My favorite was definitely the cilantro one as well as the green chile one. We visited the salsa bar 3-4 times (seriously, we loved it), and our food still hadn't arrived.  Upon its arrival, we had to wait an extra couple of minutes for utensils and napkins. By the time we had everything, we had maybe 10 minutes left to eat our food. I ended up eating a fourth of my burrito and took the rest to go. I was late for work.  The burrito itself was not spicy, but it was good! It was a good portion, it was $9.99, and it was very flavorful... after I drowned it in salsa. Honestly, I probably wouldn't get it again. And I know this place is known for their tacos and not their burritos, so I'll be sure to check them out if I ever come here again. And to be quite blunt, I don't know if I ever will. I'm not sure the food is worth the wait and the horrible service...  As much as I loved the salsa bar and the ambiance, I definitely feel like there's some other place out there that has better service and better salsa.  Until the next time I decide to visit this location and update my review, this place gets two stars for me. I might even consider just doing take out because there is no way I'm waiting again. I can only imagine how long the wait is during lunch hour...  There are so many areas for improvement. I truly do hope some of these concerns are addressed. I really wanted to like the place, but I just can't get past the horrible service.",

    "text": "I\"m feeling a little tepid about this place.  People just rave about how good the food is and so I expected to be totally wowed.  Not so.  We walked in around 7:00pm on a Saturday night and we were told it would be an hour wait.  Okay, we hunkered down for the long haul.  It was actually more like half an hour before we were shoehorned into a long table in the back room with a lovely view of the ladies room and what appeared to be a storeroom.    The artwork is quite interesting and provides contrast to what otherwise appears to be a dining room transported out of a tiny village in Mexico.  It was hot and loud and being hearing impaired, mostly just a wall of indistinguishable sound.  Our server was nice and efficient, getting margaritas for the others and for me, as the DD, iced tea.  There was one tiny corner of a wedge of lemon in my tea, but fortunately, the well-appointed salsa bar had more.  Speaking of the salsa bar, that was the highlight for me.  The first time I've ever had a strawberry-chile salsa and it was delicious.  I had several of the mini-cups with the abundant and fresh tortilla chips.  I also had a peanut salsa that tasted like a sambal, but with a nice, slow burn.  Again, a very tasty salsa.  There were about ten other salsas and they all appeared fresh and very popular.   The menu is like a regional loop through Mexico, and I found that very cool.  There were regional specialties with a local twist like Mole, Tinga, Cochinita Pibil, and fish tacos.   There was also a variety of vegetarian/vegan options that appealed to the veggies in my group.  I couldn't stray from a \"burro norteno\" that was a combination of beans, rice, potato and green chile pork.  I wish there was more green chile pork in it, and it was a bit dry, but flavorful.  Yeah, I plan to go back some night with my wife who is a vegetarian, and perhaps something will trigger that spark so that I can rave about it like everybody else.",

The third was fried in the tortilla, which was a bit strange but ok.  My friend had something else.  I forget what but he said it was fairly poor.  We waited a long damn time to get food.(30 min at least).  They gave us free chips, but it turned a quick dinner that i had high hopes for into a very long one that i would have rather not eaten.  I liked the salsa bar.  It was pretty impressive in its variety (16 different types i think)  Not going back without a gun to my head.",

The menu is unique (not your standard taco and burrito place) and they are cognizant of both vegan and gluten-free diets.   The best part is the salsa bar! They have several typical salsas, but they also have several unique salsas (strawberry is the best) and sampling each is part of the experience.  My favorite menu item are the quesas, it's like a fried corn quesadilla, but better.   It gets busy during dinner time, so plan accordingly!",

We went to La Santisima in Flagstaff last month, and had a great experience. There are still lots of great options here, but the service isn't as friendly, and the food in Flagstaff seemed to taste better. Not sure if the food here was not as great due to the long wait and several customers present today.  Again, this place isn't bad, but I'm sure there are better options for Mexican food in the area if you look a bit more.",

I do warn, there can be extremely long waits, like at least an hour wait if you're lucky....hence my 4 star review.

    "text": "After two consecutive, relishing visits, I have declared La Condesa as my numero uno taco joint in the valley of the \"Bertos\". The obscure and hoody street it resides on has always kept me hesistating until one day! Before I immersed myself into the unknown, I had to do some Yelp investigation.  I wanted to know which taco(s) in particular people were raving about.  Coincidintally, the ones people tipped about were the ones I also adored!   I kept seeing Yelpers talk about them dogfish shark tacos, so I knew I had to order those first along with the can't-go-wrong carne asada! First thing that happens upon entering the cool, wooden door, you place your order at the counter and find an open seat once a number is assigned to you.   Being that they specialize in tacos, I focused on just that (for now)! They do have burritos and other things but its all about the tacos!  Here are your options:  1 Taco: $2.99, will not fill you up, but it is still a decent size.  2 Taco Plate: $6.99, you get 2 tacos of the same core ingredient (ie. Carne Asada, Fish) plus 2 sides (refried beans and rice)  2 Mix Taco Plate: $8.29, you get to choose any 2 tacos from the menu, plus the sides I mentioned.  Beverage is additional.  What I have tried thus far:  1. Dogfish Shark Taco:  Killer! What makes these so awesome is in the beer batter!  They are super crispy, hot and the fish itself is still soft and moist!    2. Shrimp: Again, Killer! Comes out very similar to the shark tacos, except it is shrimp!  3. Carne Asasada: Holy cannoli folks! Some might argue that America's Taco Shop are better but I would say the quality and taste is near even!  Condesa might edge them with its overall composition and various salsas!  It had that mesquitte, charred off the grill kind of taste and cut perfectly to fit into a taco!  4. Cochinita Pibil (Pork): The first three tacos I mentioned were pretty darn good! But this one stood out quite well on its own.  It was savory and packed with excellent flavors!  As the menu stated, it was slow-cooked, fork tender!  The 2 sides-  Refried Beans: Excellent!  Rice: Excellent! perfectly cooked!  The cool part about dining here is enjoying their Salsa Bar! If I recall correctly , there were about 10 different salsas to choose from!  The tricky part is pairing it with the taco you just ordered! Experiment, I say! As part of every order they bring you a basket of warm, house chips!  From the outside, you would never assume that such a great taco place existed, but once you step inside you know something good is about to happen!  Every wall has some sort of hip and contemporary Mexican art, from flowers to people.  The overall decor is very tasteful and upbeat!  Staff members are very friendly and courteous!  I took my office colleagues out during my second visit and they have nothing but positive responses and is begging to come back for more!  Whether you are a connoiseur of Mexican cuisine, tacos or just love eating good food, I highly advise you stop by!  For the overall great taste and value, its hard to beat this cool taco spot that will please all your senses!",

I am giving this 4 stars because it was kind of a long wait (35 minutes) and there aren't a lot of benches outside to sit, (also it was hard to get water refills during our dinner.) But once inside, it is totally worth it!  The salsa bar is very unique and I liked how I could sample so many different kinds.  I got the mole tacos and would recommend trying one and maybe a different kind.",

The drinks were generic but generous and well priced. I give them 3 stars because of the service, or lack there of. Every time I go in there, whether it is 6 or 9 pm there is a 30-60 minute wait and about 4 empty tables. There is a sense of confusion and priorities are not focused on customer service. The bathroom was a disaster. I've seen better kept facilities at night clubs and that worries me. You know what they say about the bathroom - it is as clean as the kitchen!  Like I said, they had folks out the door by 7:30 and I had to go up to the register to pay because no one came by to pick up my tab/card. We had 2 dinners and 2 rounds of happy hour drinks - we paid $70. For that kind of money, I would at least expect to be seated at one  of the many open tables that were available when we left. Instead, they let people wait for over 30 mins while others (me) had to wait 20 mins to pay. I think I'd go back but maybe just do take out.",

I dropped by La Santisima with a friend on a Sunday night around 6:00 pm. Parking was a bit interesting, but thankfully we were able to get a spot on the side of the building. Now, I'd been to the Glendale location a couple of times earlier and once I entered into the Phoenix location, I was at a loss for words -- in the worst way possible.   It was dimly lit, dingy, and dark and had a general look of disarray and chaos. We were seated quickly and were able to put our orders in while we sampled the salsas and some of my favorites from the Glendale location were nowhere to be found. In terms of the food, I got the veggie quesa and my friend got a burro. I have gotten the same quesa at the Glendale location before and it just came out as a massive, well adorned, well though out plate that I felt like was a behemoth of a dish. The quesa at this location was noticeably smaller and did not have any of the accouterments/garnishes that the quesa at the Glendale location had. My friends burro was the same in the sense that it was literally a plain looking burrito cut in two on a plate. The food itself tasted good and our server was great, but the atmosphere was just so dim and dark that it really detracted from our experience.   I say drop by the Glendale location if you want to enjoy the great food and skip on this one if you're looking for any type of nice atmosphere.",

We stand in line to order and then sat down, the food was out within a few minutes. We ordered the queso for the table which was literally incredible; if you only get one thing here,GET THIS. I have nothing but excellent reviews for the food, everything we ordered was beyond amazing and absolutely original in taste. The horchata was delicious, probably the best I've ever had. It has a cinnamon taste to it and pro tip: it taste a lot better if you pour it out and drink it with the pecan and fruit chunks!

We got seated right away and our server got us chips and told us to help ourselves do the salsa bar, that has more than 12 different types of salsa. They even had a peanut salsa and pecan salsa!! Every salsa on that bar was so good. My fav was the strawberry salsa and this hot habanero salsa.    Hubby tried the street taco plate, which was delicious. You can choose any 3, he has the chicken Tinga, Barbacoa and shrimp. I had vegetarian tacos, one was with deep fried avocado dipped in beer batter served over cabbage and this amazing sauce. Also tried their Santisima vegetarian and cauliflower taco. It was so good!!  They serve their quesadilla deep fried, my son had that enchilada style. It was huge, he loved it.  The margaritas looked amazing, so many different choices, I hope to try at my next visit",

We didn't get waited on, so I had to ask for someone to help us. The reason they didn't help us was because I  the hostess made a mistake, she didn't add our name to a list so the two servers didn't know. No excuse. Both of them walked by our table served other tables around us, looked at our direction for 15 minutes and not one person cared to ask us \"have you've been helped?\" and then we we did get service it was dry and bare ass minimum. The light fixtures above us were terrible, it was cold, and no music. Everyone was just whispering to each other, probably afraid that others could hear their conversations.

This is a top 10 spot in Arizona for Mexican food (in its price range, at least) and anyone who disagrees has terrible taste and should go back to Illinois or something.   Savor every salsa because while each individual salsa may not be the *best* out there, they are all above average, and there's like 15 to choose from. That being said, you could easily chow down on like 3 baskets of chips in the time it takes to actually get your order. It is great, but goodness gracious does this location also take longer than expected. 20 minutes into your wait, you'll think \"OK it's good stuff so it should take longer than average tacos do\". And then you'll be like me and reach that point where you're just hangry and seriously ready to berate someone because no other place in the valley would be this consistently SLOW.   In that moment of frustration and despair that will happen LITERALLY EVERY TIME YOU VISIT, your food will appear and it will be glorious. You will devour it in half the time it took to prepare. I mean seriously it was just some mole tacos with shrimp (in lieu of other proteins)--don't you guys prep before you open? They'll act like everything is OK and they didn't just break you with the wait time, you'll tip generously, and be ready to do the same song and dance the next time you want good Mexican food.   I guess that like the wait times, this review didn't end up being so short after all. But if you've got a free hour and a half, your taste buds wont' regret it!",

    "text": "*Review based only on take out experience*  First of all: the menu prices on Yelp (menu pictures) differs from actual prices. We ordered two burritos and paid around $32.00. Personally, I think that's a bit excessive for 2 burritos. I wasn't sure if we were buying burritos or stocks in the restaurant.  When we called and placed our order for two burritos (one shrimp & one aztec), we were told it'd be ready in 10 minutes or so. The person who took our order sounded like he may have been new as it was pretty confusing just to place an order.   When we arrived, I was a little surprised by the location & appearance...its in a very questionable neighborhood & parking is tough! As sketchy neighborhoods have the best authentic food(typically), we were still excited to try. Since we couldn't find parking, we kept the car running while I ran in. When I walked in, I was even more shocked to see how everyone was dressed. For some odd reason, people were extremely dressed up for the casual setting that it is.  It was also very busy inside.   I told the cashier that I'm just picking up an order and she gave me few cups for salsa and gave me my total. When she told me it was around $32, I had to double check what we ordered! After confirming that it is in fact for two burritos, I was surely hoping it'd be the best thing I've ever eaten.   They were ok at best , salsa was also just ok. My shrimp burrito had a ton of veggies in it but the tortilla was super thick & our chips were stale. I've had way better burritos at other places. Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing since this place does have a lot of good reviews & I noticed few awards on their dining lobby. It may also be possible that it used to be better at some point & went down in quality but up in prices?",

A mix of spicy peppers, cilantro and lime that only got better the longer it mulled. Poured the rest of my lime margarita in the remaining mix-ins to pull out some of the awesome flavors. So good!   Entrees: Al pastor Lonche - all of the components were good, but lacked a certain cohesiveness. Could have used some extra spice or something to break up the dryness. We originally wanted a different lonche but they were out of the pickled onions for the other one.   Street tacos - carne arrachera, chilango suadero and al pastor. Chilango suadero was probably the fave. We came about an hour before closing so there wasn't much salsa from the salsa bar to try out and enhance the tacos with.   Interior: Awesome art hanging from the walls! Did not feel very clean and the tables were peeling but it certainly didn't take away from the freshness of the food.   Service: Server was awesome, friendly and helpful!! Food and drinks were out very quickly (:",

Perks: the food is amazing. The artwork inside is dope. They also have a salsa bar with a wide variety of salsa. Oh, the wait staff are excellent. Jordan was such a cutie.

As a vegetarian, I am typically limited in what I can order for tacos but this place knocked it out of the park; they had a whole section for interesting vegetarian tacos and burritos. Ordered the veggie classic santisima which I would highly recommend! The melted cheese on top of a layer of mushrooms was delicious! Also ordered the Gandhi tacos which tasted a little like a salad. And ordered the avocado fresh cheese taco with a spicy salsa which I would also recommend. Honestly, this is probably the best taco place that I've been to. And to top it off, every single salsa at the salsa bar was great!",

    "text": "UPDATED REVIEW 2018:  It saddens me so much to have to update my review of what used to be one of our very favorite places to eat out. Since their expansion this place has gone downhill so fast.  First, the service is just awful now, it shouldn't take 10-15 minutes to get someone to come and take a drink order, especially when servers have walked past your table several times.  Second, when food is ordered, you expect it to be hot when it arrives at your table, our food has been lukewarm at best the last couple of times we have tried to dine here.  Third, even my used to be favorite part of this Restaurant, the salsa bar, has managed to highly disappoint me.  My favorite cilantro salsa had little to no flavor whatsoever, and my other favorite, salsa pecan was so spicy I couldn't eat it (it's always had a little kick, but this was way more than it used to have). I have tried to give them the benefit of the doubt three different times now, and they still continue to disappoint, and to top it off, I have gotten terrible stomach aches each time I have visited recently (this never happened prior to the expansion). What the heck has happened to this \"gem\" we found and loved so long ago?!?!?   I so wish it would go back to the way it was.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Love, love, love this Phoenix gem!  I stumbled upon it when I was out house hunting & my husband learned about it from a co-worker, so we tried it one night & have been hooked ever since!  The salsa bar is awesome & the food is fantastic!  We are so happy to live just a few short miles from here & we go often!",

The Dia De los Muertos motif and wooden furniture make it perfect for easy conversation.   Most folks seated around us already know where to go for lunch that's not too pricey and homemade.   The Horchata is nothing short of liquid dessert, filled with pecans, fruit and rice milk.  You can avoid dairy all together with this and a special bullet burro with guac and lettuce. The salsa bar sets the standard for good restaurants.  It's wide variety of salsas leave little doubt what creative people run the place.  My hope is that only a few people read this and try it. Otherwise, to my chagrin, the next time we park on 16th Street, we may have to WAIT in a line outside.",

We ordered several types of tacos and loved them all.  Even more impressive was the well stocked salsa bar ranging from cheese causes and mild salsas to some that really make your mouth burn.  I had a great time here and will definitely go back.",

One guy does a good job but he's not always there. I've had to wait for a while before. One time I just estimated my tab, left money and left. For a spot that made it on diners and dives they need some work. I would think they would care more about service and presentation. Food is always good. But I'm not there to hang out for long. Reminds me of a little dive in mexico. I usually enjoy myself despite the flaws. Best is go when its slow.",

The tacos were incredible. The spicy pork, the beef, the white fish all mouth watering. The refried beans and rice served on the side tasted awesome, I just wish the portions were larger. Right away we were served large baskets of warm tortilla chips and we tried every salsa at the bar. Some were very spicy!!!! I enjoyed the cilantro cream one on the fish tacos. The quesadilla came with avocado slices on top and the cheese was very tasty. These tacos were gourmet! I really enjoyed everything we ate here and would definitely come back. Prices are fair as well. They staff kept refilling our glasses of water and kept checking in on us. We had a great lunch here.",

The fish tacos are amazing, as they have a real Baja flavor; topped with mayo, beer battered fish! My fiance ordered the Sonoran carne azada burrito.

La Santisima is fantastic. I had the Azteca Tinga burro, and I don't remember the last time I had chicken that was so juicy. I think their secret is in their sauces/marinades. The burrito was huge but I ate it all up because it was so good and I could not stop. I also love the salsa bar - they have a large variety of salsas and it's fun to try all of them. My favourite is the strawberry one.   The only downside was that service was slow. I think we waited 15 minutes just for someone to greet us and take our orders. I heard that the restaurant increased capacity so I hope they will increase staff too in order to meet the increased needs.",

Lots of tasty tacos to choose from (the tiger shrimp was the best we tried) and they do a different spin on quesadillas. These are served fried and puffy. Lots of cheesy filling inside- the Gaucho was tasty but with all of the unique flavors (chimichirri, pickled onions, etc) I thought it would be a bit more flavorful. Definitely large enough to share.   Salsa bar has many flavorful options, but I don't like the idea of all patrons having access to something I'd consume (too many dirty hands, coughing, sneezing).   The margarita had barely any tequila, but I did appreciate the fresh fruit slices in it.    This is a TINY, TINY place and doesn't offer much authenticity when it comes to decor or music (Katy Perry and other pop music - cringe).",

My friend, Kenner Bob, from up Iowa way, was in town for her annual visit to Aridzona and it's my most excellent pleasure to choose the joint for us to brunch and have a smart cocktail, or two (\"Let's all have a little drinkey!\").  I'd spotted La Santisima via Yelp about three months ago and knew immediately I wanted to try it. I'm so glad I waited for Kenner Bob's visit as it turned out to be the perfect place.  We started our culinary journey with the joint's Guacamole. Admittedly, I'm not one for bastardized guac, but this guac was da bomb. Chunky with diced mango, dried cranberries and the usual salt, pepper and garlic. Every bite equated nuclear yummy noises from both of us.   Kenner Bob chose two tacos (all street sized) from the Mix-n-Match menu:  Mahi-Mahi,  Chicken Tinga (I think) and one from the Specialty section:  a beef brisket number that was sublime.   I chose the Tiger Shrimp, Chicken Tinga and a Pork taco that escapes my memory.  I loved the Pork number.   Sides for both of us were the included rice and beans. The rice was buttery and tasted like cream was involved in its making. Scrumdiddleyumptious, it was. I'm a rice fanatic so I could've eaten 20 or six tubfulls.  Trust me when I say it would take at least 20 visits to this joint to work one's way through the menu. Kenner Bob and I took 20 minutes -- whist eating the chips, salsa and guac -- to decide on what to order.  Everything -- and I mean EVERYthing -- sounded delicious.  We could've read every choice's description but we finally had to \"shoot the engineer\" and place our order.  The waitrons are incredibly patient and understanding of dyed-in-the-wool foodies trying to decide which goodies to order.   The added drawing ticket to this joint are the Margaritas. There are about 10 choices.  Kenner Bob ordered the Award Winning Margarita and after one sip she said, \"I'd vote for it!\"  For Kenner Bob it was the perfect Marg:  sour but not overly so; sweet but not treacly.    My Marg was incredible. To save my life I can't remember the name of it but it contained an herbal liqueur.  Truly, if this danged ol' cocktail doesn't cure you then you weren't sick.   If you're seeking True Mexican cuisine in a super casual restaurant -- and killer-diller Margaritas -- corer  rapidiamente to La Santisima.",

But if you're hispanic and want to take your non-hispanic buddies to a \"mexican\" place, then La Santisima is the perfect spot where their minds will be blown thinking they're eating \"authentic\" mexican food and at the same time you'll be satisfied too with the tasty Americanized version of a torta or quesadilla.

I have been here about a dozen times since then!This place was on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, so there is a lot of hype around this place, and trust me, it's real!  La Santisima has a superb menu with a big variety of items to pick from. Their tacos are delicious and they have a great Aztec Tinga taco. The quesadillas are huge, I can only eat about half when I get it.  They offer a large salsa bar that has at least 10 different salsas ranging from spicy to mild flavors.   They offer a house margarita for $5 that is delicious, I get about two when I come hehe.They have a small bar but the drink offering is big, including Mexican beers.   Service is friendly, fast, and courteous. 6-7 PM seems to be a peak time for this restaurant, so make sure you're here on time to get a table since it's a bit small and can fill up quick!",

The mariachi tacos tastes like they were missing salt. One of them seemed like it even had way too much oil. However the beans and rice were real good. Aside from an angry lady behind us, the atmosphere was pleasant and really really enjoyed trying all the different salsas that they have.",

I am sure they have delicious authentic Mexican food but unfortunately we couldn't try it because when we walked in at 9:30pm on Thursday a hostess or who knows who quickly rushed over to us. I thought for a split second she was rushing to greet us instead she said that they were closed ? Google and yelp said they are open until 10pm not to mention their OPEN Sign was on and lighted. She said they close at 9 but their restaurant had customers in there. The worst part was when I walked out I was taking this picture that I have attached and that same girl who ousted us saying they were \"closed\" came outside and said actually we are open you can come in haha no thanks !",

I ordered the El Gaucho burro, packed full of marinated steak, then topped with avocado, cucumber, and chimichurri sauce which gave the burrito a crisp flavor. I then proceeded to drench it in chipotle salsa from the salsa bar! The horchata here is to die for, made fresh and topped with walnuts and sliced fruit! For the price, you'll be hardpressed to find an authentic Mexican meal this good anywhere else!",

They are traditional Mexico City style which are not in the flour tortilla as most places serve but are maid out flour ( I think they are from Mexico City because we were brought up eating them this way). They are deep fried which is worth trying just because of how deliciously amazing they are! There salsa bar is unique with lots of choices, but I do wish they had at least one spicy one. I think their service can improve, ( maybe our server was just having a bad day). But overall good place.",

I tried the mahi mahi (grilled, I'm not sure if there is a fried version) and the veggie taco. Hmm, they are both equally good; I can't pick one over the other. I can say that the Pecan salsa helped out the fish taco with a nice spiciness and gave it that pizzazz it needed to set it apart.   This is my first visit to La Condesa so, I'm not sure how the place works, but from what I gather you just walk-in and grab a seat then a server will eventually get to you. It was a Sunday evening when we stopped by and there was only 1 SERVER!!! Poor thing was running all over the place. I don't blame her for not getting to us with the first few minutes we sat down. After a little bit she regained her composure and was friendly and accommodating. She really shouldn't of been the only person serving the place was hopping as one group left another entered. There was no one standing around waiting for a place to sit, and honestly I don't know where they would wait.   The paintings on the walls are amazing. Great art work to look at. However, I was seated at the bar and faced empty bar shelves and the light above me was out, so it was very dim. So as far as ambiance, it just wasn't quite working for me.   Back to the food.. The refried beans could use some improvement. Okay, so I am Hispanic and have been eating beans since birth and I have never had beans so watered down. It was more of a cold bean soup. Maybe that's what La Condesa was going for, but that didn't work for me either. The rice was good and warm.    I enjoyed the salsa bar. So many salsas, Cilantro (like), Pico (like), Pecan (like), Peanut, Mexican (like), the list goes on!!  I would visit this place again with the hopes that I get a table next time!",

The cochinita quesadilla, which really doubles as a Mexican stromboli only deep fried and not baked, is a culinary triumph. And the artwork, all of which macabre -  depicting 'Dio del muerto' scenes -  is erie to say the least, but colorful and provocative.  Here's what you won't like. Your missing car if you don't lock it and set the alarm. The chairs - likely designed by an orthopedic surgeon whose life's mission is to rid the world of scoliosis, one taco aficionado at a time.  In their defense, the chairs look to be some kind of Mexican relic, something they found in an old Mission or something. They're artsy and very heavy carved wood.  One problem. They're so heavy, when you stand up, attempting to furtively sneak to the salsa bar for the fifth time hoping no-one will spot your sloth-ass in the process, they'll give you up in a New York second as they make the most God-awful racket scraping the bare floor.   I don't like it when I'm trying to be sneaky and some inanimate object signals everyone, warning them of my intentions to abscond with the entire salsa bar, greedily hogging it all to myself.",

This is the kind of food that goes for $12 - $15/plate if it were located in an upscale area.  They have done a great job with the interior and the food is really wonderful.  5 Top reasons I love La Condesa:  ~ Beautiful food. Unique flavors.   ~ Great salsa bar: aver a dozen lovely hand made salsas; I liked them all  ~ Price: you can spend under $7 and have a really good meal  ~ Convelient: It is only a 2 minute drive from 24th & Camelback.  ~ Atmosphere: the interior and the service create a great place to dine.  ***We eat out several times a week, and this place is now at the top of the list for my wife and I both.***",

    "text": "After almost 2 months of visiting this place, I am still fantasizing about their food!  I trusted my fellow Yelpers when I was taking a road trip with family to Tucson from California and had to stop for dinner on the way.  The Yelpers' raving reviews did not let us down.  When we got there it actually looked closed from the outside especially since the OPEN sign wasn't lit, but we took a chance and opened the door anyway to find that it was indeed open.    It's a tiny little place with a Dia de los Muertos theme, so it was rich with color and culture.  There was only one server so it was a little slower than we'd like, but in her defense, she was pregnant.   We each had to order the horchata with pecans and melon because it sounded so good.  The cup it came in was HUMUNGOUS and thank goodness for that because it was awesomely delicious!  We also pigged out on the chips and variety of salsas at the salsa bar.  The salsas are seriously amazing and there were a lot to choose from and taste.  I especially loved the jicama salsa.    I ordered 2 carne asada tacos with rice and beans.  I was already so full from eating all those chips and horchata and usually it's hard for me to enjoy the taste of something after I'm super full, but the tacos were so good I finished them.  I only tasted a little bit of the rice, which was okay... probably my least favorite thing I ate there, but the beans were very good!    I was soooo full afterwards and I left with a smile on my face and a new favorite restaurant that I'll have to stop at whenever I'm in Phoenix, which isn't very often, sadly.",

They have a salsa bar with tons of different salsas you can try out which is fun and gives you a good variety of spice and flavors (try the strawberry one!). All of the tacos I've had have been delicious but if you do get the plate with 2 tacos and rice and beans you're going to be really full or have half of your plate to take home.

Really interesting assortment of sauces and salsas (jicama salsa, peanut sauce stuff was great.) Looks like they just recently added some awesome new tequilas so I'm looking forward to stopping by at dinner time. Really authentic stuff. Looks like they just had Diners Dives and Drive ins there as there was a cool metal art piece signed by Guy Fieri. Food came out quickly despite lunch rush. I'll be back soon.  Recommended to people looking for authentic places to make their more boring friends jealous of their foodie acumen.",

Free Chips and Salsa Bar - options including Chipotle, Pico de Gailo, Robano Pibil, Peanut, Jicama, Pecan, Soy, etc.  Baja Sur Shark Taco - Corn Tortilla with Beer Battered Wild Dogfish and lettuce with cilantro mayo  Cabo Shrimp Taco with Beer Battered Wild Tiger Shrimp and cilantro mayo, jicama  Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco - Roasted Pork Shoulder with Achiote Rojo slow cooked in banana leaves topped with lime marinated onions and salsa habanera mayo  Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken Taco - Spices, Chiles, Nuts, and Chocolate  Realizing that an inordinate portion of our travel west, from the Port Fonda experience at Greendirt Farm outside of Kansas City to The Shed and Salsa Brava, had focused on Mexican food I couldn't help but pass by La Condessa while my mother was in town for tacos and although I know some in Phoenix may claim the space is not \"authentic\" enough for them (from what I've gathered, according to some locals you need to have questionable evaluations from the Health Department to be legit) I can say without a doubt that although I've not been south of the border, these are the best tacos I've ever tasted.  Beginning first with another free chips-and-salsa-bar stocked with a baker's dozen of house-made salsas and sauces paired with slightly salted, almost greaseless, and pleasantly warm tortilla chips and moving on to the four tacos featuring local produce and fresh proteins on (unfortunately not house made) imported flour tortillas I particularly enjoyed the crunchy texture and delicate flavors of the shrimp taco while the bright acidity of the pork shoulder and smoky spice of the chicken taco both worked nicely as well.    Perhaps not as regional as some taco stands (or trucks) and instead choosing to focus on the depth and breadth of Mexican cuisine from coast to coast I'm sure the is \"better\" or \"more authentic\" cuisine to be found both here and over the border, but thus far I've not experienced it (outside of the vastly more upscale, expensive, and certainly less authentic Distrito.)",

Oh and the sound of the chairs screaming across the floor made me cringe. I seriously doubt that I'll ever eat in the restaurant again. I would totally get to go orders since the tacos were bomb and I want to try other stuff!!",

I was charged $13.50 for a bean and cheese burrito al la carte, which wasn't on the menu, but it was more expensive then the majority of the burritos on the menu which included meat, quac, rice, salsa, etc. On top of that, my entire burrito was filled with just cheese. I literally had to unfold my burrito to find it was a tortilla wrapped around shredded cheese. No bean inside. Extremely disappointing especially when our order was so simple and the food was so over priced. Would not recommend to friends and would never consider coming back here.",

What keeps me coming back are the amazing tacos.  I order the shrimp and the mahi fish street tacos each time and they are some of the best in town.  Really great flavor and healthy portions.  Can't wait to eat again!!  A few particulars - this is a very small little place on 16th with mostly street side or residential parking, no actual lot.  During peak times, good luck finding a seat and the line at the register where you must order will leave you waiting a bit.  It's worth it for the taste, but just be prepared.",

    "text": "I love the food at santisima.  the salads are much larger than necessary but very tasty and fresh. I usually order them to go while at work. It could easily be shared with two people.  Another favorite is the Mayan cochinita pibil tacos.  They're not the mini tacos that you find at so many restaurants these days; they're hearty and filling and greasy AF, but also they are what really brings me back.  Their margaritas are really good and they have several different types to choose from. One common thing I have noticed is that there are not enough servers for the amount of tables and people that are there. I guess what I am saying is that you might only get one margarita, so make it last.",

Could only take 2 bites. I showed the waiter and he just shrugged his shoulders and apologized. I know he didnt cook it, but he didnt offer to remake it or worst case scenario take it off the bill. 2 street tacos and 2 bites of a quesadilla, that looked nothing like advertised for $21. Never again, lesson learned.",

The gaucho taco is a solid staple with charcoal grilled steak, sliced avocado and pickled onions, and the arrachera taco has subtle complexities of flavor despite its somewhat simplistic presentation. There are also an abundance of other delicious/unique menu options (such as the deep fried Quesadilla for example), and the wait staff is very helpful and kind as well. Would definitely recommend this place to family and friends in search of a local one of a kind hole in the wall Mexican restaurant. Definitely a must try if you are in the area.",

Unfortunately me and my pregnant wife we both ordered similar item she had chicken in hers and I was lucky one to get the deep fried chewy like gum fried pork which was Very bizarre. Horchata was again over hyped I felt. All in all it was 40 minutes wait time with my pregnant wife and garbage like taste at least what we ordered. The salsa's are not so great I can make better one in my Vitamix @home or you can get canned salsa's from food city which are far better.  May be the burritos and Tacos are good and I am writing this review if there are someone like me who might dislike deep fried chewy pork in Quesadilla.  It was $33 with tip $38 (I don't know why I tipped... lol)I  wish I wouldn't have gone there and would buy some food for hungry people on the streets with the same amount of money that would have given me much satisfaction. Will never go here again... If in FL try Senor Taco in St Petersburg and try all the items it's worth every penny. I am an Indian and trying to find a good Mexican restaurant but it's bland taste in Phoenix including this place.",

It was Sunday evening about 5 pm so I can understand the 30 min wait to be seated. I figured I would get a drink while we waited, so I ordered 2 michelada's with Tecate Light. I will confess, they were good which accounts for one of the stars I have given. By this time, I have noticed how unhappy all the employees seem to be. Would it hurt to crack a smile? Once seated, we placed our order and were given a half empty basket of chips... the chips were good and the salsa options were great! The salsa bar is what earned that 2nd star! Unfortunately, chip refills will cost you $2.70 - may have been worth is since it took some 30 min plus to get our food. The food was meh. Dull, over-priced and served cold.... like it had been sitting a while. To top it off, when we got the bill - the michelada's were $12 each!!! This place really missed the mark for me and my husband and we will NOT be returning.",

The Mariachi taco was a Barbacoa taco and the shell was hard, meat was dry, and I was searching for the flavors and there was none. When they say gourmet tacos, I'm thinking it would be like Barrio Cafe.. nope not even close. Rice, is white rice and corn, nothing special, beans are your typical beans you get from any Mexican place. I would say, maybe I can go back and try something else on their menu (lots of options), but the service was very amateur (couldn't complain about anything because they don't check on you during your meal) and the host had to clean our table after we sat. Also, the pesty fly was why they got 2 stars from 3. The decor is authentic looking and I love the paintings but other than that, I'll spend my money down the street instead.",

    "text": "What's most fascinating about La Santisima is that their three separate locations seem to vary greatly in reputation. There's the one in Downtown Glendale, which receives mostly positive reviews. There's one in Flagstaff, that strangely receives a lot of harsh criticism. And then there's this location, the flagship, which receives an exorbitant amount of Yelp reviews that are mostly positive, with the occasional one-star reviews complaining about their terrible customer service.  My feelings on Santisima have always been mixed. It's one of my girlfriend's favorite restaurants based on the quality of their guacamole, horchata, and rice and beans. Hell, they also make some pretty decent tacos to boot. But as many people have stated, Santisima is a primary example of a restaurant that's become incredibly popular, but has failed to adapt their model to accommodate the crowds.  Wait times are very common. Parking is horrid, there's hardly any room to wait inside, and rarely will you ever be greeted upon walking in. We usually have to hunt down a server in order to put our names on the list. What's also strange is that, you might see tons of empty tables inside that are unused, while crowds of people are waiting inside in order to get in. When we were dining there recently, a nearby couple finished up their food and left. Their table was left uncleaned for over an hour - all while a group of about a dozen people were waiting outside.  I've also learned that this isn't a restaurant where you want to spread out your portions. Order everything at once. Drinks, appetizers, and entrees. And as soon as they bring out the food, request the bill. If not, you'll be sitting around here for a long, long time.  Santisima's menu is kind of intimidating. They cover a lot of ground. Probably too much, in fact. I usually play it safe and just order some of their street tacos. They're good, but in the last few years with increased exposure to other options, I don't quite consider them to be as mind-blowingly amazing as some people are saying. Rice and beans are very good, however, with my girlfriend always citing how authentic the beans taste in comparison to that canned rubbish most people dish out.  Many people rave about the salsa bar, as if it's some kind of new, foreign invention that they've never seen before. Yes, people. There's a salsa bar. Any reputable taco place has one. Santisima might be considered a cut above the rest, however, because of the variety available.    I ordered their traditional quesadilla on a whim, expecting the same thing I receive at practically every taco shop in Phoenix. Instead, I received a giant-sized, deep-fried quesadilla with oaxaca cheese and butter flavoring that's more on par with a gordita. I love the cheese, but the breading is a bit too chewy for my taste.  Their horchata is consistently referenced by many people as being one of the best you can find - provided that you're into chunks. The drink, which is far superior to the more commonly found pre-mixed rubbish, contains hearty cuts of strawberry, cantaloupe, and pecans. In my opinion, it definitely lives up to its reputation.  The place has a \"dive\" feel, similar to what you'd find at Barrio Cafe. Thankfully, they're a bit less arrogant about their prices - so the place seems more of an authentic establishment and less like a yuppie playground. However, watching clueless men unknowingly walk in and out of the \"Catrinas\" restroom always manages to generate some laughs. They've since added a \"Women\" sign above the door to stop this from happening.  The food at Santisima is very good - although I think my girlfriend is a bit more enthusiastic about it than I am. I don't quite see them as the five-star establishment that so many other people claim, but they're still worthy of a strong recommendation based on the food alone.  Recommended!",

There is a salsa bar that you can go to to get any sorts of salsa they have made for the day. They were delicious! The food was absolutely fantastic. I ordered a pork burrito that was so good every bite, and there was a lot of food. I couldn't finish it, and I can eat a lot! My husband and friend both really enjoyed their entrees, too (shrimp Jamaican burrito and a roasted cauliflower burrito). It wasn't until after I ordered that I decided to ask the server what their most popular dish was, and I wish I would have ordered what she described to me! Our server was really friendly, too. I'd be in trouble if I loved in Phoenix because I probably frequent this place more than I should.",

The guac was unique, chunky with bits of mango and crasins, onions, tomatoes.  I highly recommend the cabo shrimp tacos.  Don't come during the rush times. This is not traditional Mexican.  The flavors are from the Oaxaca region which is why there is only corn tortillas and fruits in a variety of the dishes.  This is not the place for smothered burritos, enchiladas, chimichangas, or fajitas. This is taco land that also has burros and fried quesadillas. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.",

That said: the Sonora Arrachera Burro was hands-down the best burrito I have ever had in this country.  Do yourself a favor and order one of their quesas before your meal, too.  And come hungry - those burritos are not small.   My only regret is that I'm not in town longer, because there were other menu items that sounded really good as well.  I guess I'm just going to have to come back to Phoenix soon so I can try another one.",

We had to wait in a sketchy neighborhood for 30 min so was it worth it?  I would say yes since i haven't had too many good Mexican salsa bars. This one had about 10 salsas one was even strawberry !  The smoked marlin bowl was delicious as well as the beef steak tacos.",

Husband had the pork with banana leaf, rice and beans on side.   He left the rice alone (too full). His burro was excellent with a good flavor to the slow roasted pork.  I got the chicken burro with moles sauce.  It was not great, no taste of nuts or orange.  I took the flour tortillas off and mixed the chicken with a little salsa.  Still not great.  Five stars because my husband's pork was good and the salsa bar was really fun. Place was really busy.  Will come back to try something else.",

The personnel were very friendly. the only table service is when they take your food to your table. So you have to order food at the register, pay and then get a number. It is a popular place so it got full and busy quick. The food was really good. My husband and I are foodies so eating at this place was fun. The salsa bar was delicious. You can sample lots of different salsas. None of them were spicy, but then again I love spicy so don't take my word for it. I recommend this place. I have family coming to visit me soon from California and this is the first place im going to take them to eat. For any foodie, you got to try it at least once.",

Really well put together. We get seated and noticed that there was a little salsa station. We picked ourselves most of the salsas they were serving. Honestly, they were good but not the best.  After 10-12 minutes of waiting for someone to take our drink order, a waitress comes. She later comes back with our drinks. We yet again had to wait a little longer to place our order. We finally ordered our food. 15mins go by.. 25... 30... 40... honestly that's the last time I checked the clock! We were getting so impatient. If it wasn't because we had eaten chips we would have been more hangry. Mind you it's the 1st time she had check up on us after an hour of being there. My boyfriend wanted another drink but our waitress was nowhere to be seen for most of the time we were there she would pass our tables but not acknowledge us at all.  For the 1st time after she took our food order, god knows how many minutes later she comes and checks up on us She then comes to tell us that something had happened to her their ticket machine and I guess the cook never got it because the machine was jammed. She gave my boyfriend a beer on the house. Three minutes after that, we finally get out food!! I mean the food was good, it was actually really good and we enjoyed our plate I'm not gonna lie we thought it would be bigger portions but it's OK. I was just really upset at the service we got.  Not gonna lie, I went to the bathroom it was  pretty dirty there was toilet paper on the floor, you could tell they haven't been cleaned in a couple hours and there wasn't that many people in the restaurant so I don't know how many hours it had been since the last clean. The menu was a little overwhelming.  The 2 stars are for the food and design of the place.",

This place was covered by Guy Fieri and that raised my expectations a few notch.  The gourmet tacos were nothing special. My group had the fish, shark and chicken tacos. And none of the 3 stood out. The salsa bar had over a dozen salsa variations and most of them were good. However, the disposable cups were too small. Ended up making several annoying trips to the salsa bar. Recommend the peanut salsa. I had the La Condesa Shrimp burro. It was good. The guac was also pretty good.",

My friend ordered one of the quesadillas and took half of it home to enjoy later since they are quite large! She's been here before and knew what she was getting into so she planned to eat half for lunch and have half for dinner.   The chips are super fresh and delicious with the right amount of salt and the salsa/condiments bar is AMAZING! My favorite is the salsa verde. I think i had four servings of that because it's so darn good!   Additionally, their service is amazing! The guy up front could tell I hadn't been in before so he made some recommendations and checked on us shortly after we received our delicious meal! Definitely recommend and will be back!",

We were told about their famous salsa bar and horchata!   Foodie Tip: Try their horchata and guacamole sauce.   For $8.95 (plus tax) you can order 3 tacos with rice and beans. It's a perfect combination especially for the price.   I'm a little ashamed for this but after my first time here, I stopped by three times in a row. Haha! Oh well!

It was so different with chunky avocado, onions, tomatoes, cilantro and then they added dried cranberries and diced fresh mango. Amazing. My hubby and I had the three taco plates.

    "text": "The most unique-tasting Mexican food around! We keep this restaurant in our lunch/dinner rotation. We swing by every 1-2 weeks. Here are 3 different dining options:  Dine-in Dinner: On busy week nights service can be really slow. We've waited 30+ minutes to get our food and we do not have the patience for that. On average the wait has been about 25 minutes from when they take our order, which is alright but could definitely improve.   They provide complimentary chips & salsa with the meal. They have a salsa bar with tons of different flavors to try.  The horchata is just as unique as their tacos - it's mixed with fruit bits and pecans. We order it every single time, definitely recommend giving it a try.   We've tried a handful of gourmet tacos and a couple of burritos. They were all good but the tacos are better. We've tried almost all of the tacos in the gourmet menu and every single one has been amazing. I understand why it's always so busy but we really dislike the wait times.. So we stopped dining in and order take-our instead.  Take-Out: We've been ordering take-out and we have been obsessed! We call to order ahead, pick up the food, bring it back to our house and enjoy our tacos & horchata. Our food is always ready within 20 minutes or less which is so much faster than dining in. We are fortunate to live about 5 minutes away so we save a lot of time by doing this. The food doesn't get soggy and tastes the same. They still provide chips to-go & access to the salsa bar so it's the same dining experience without a server and eliminates the wait time. Huge pro for us.  Weekend Brunch: They only provide brunch on the weekends, the weekday menu items are not available. Their brunch is great as well! They have sweet and savory options to try from. Our favorite was the crunchy French toast - perfect amount of sweet and great texture. We've only gone for brunch once but I would definitely go again. It's not as busy as the weekdays so the dining experience was good.  Overall the food is 5/5 but I had to knock down a star because of the slow service for weekday dine-in. If you don't mind waiting or happen to stop by when they're not busy, you'll love this place. If you live close by, I definitely recommend getting take-out.",

A good chunk of the chips were a stale and the ones that weren't were tasty.   I got the mix and match three taco deal which comes with rice and beans. I got one carne arrachera (steak), chilango suadero (beef brisket), and Al Pastor (spicy pork). All three tacos were delicious. The rice and beans were good, too. I waited a good 25 minutes for my taco plate which is longer than most Mexican restaurants.   Had I not tried the stale chips and not wait as long as I did, this place would've been 5 stars just based on the tacos. The steak was the best.",

    "text": "Headed to La Santisima to get some great tasting tacos! It was a taco craving kind of day.  Arrived around 7pm on a Tuesday night and the place wasn't too busy, was greeted and seated right away.  Started the meal off with some house made guacamole, it had cilantro, serrano chili, onion, tomato, mango, jicama and cranberries. Oh my yum this stuff is amazing. Our server even told us they just where awarded best tasting guacamole in the valley and I'd have to agree!  ( <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.phoenixnewtimes.com%2Fbest-of%2F2018%2Fla-vida%2Fbest-guacamole-10864711&s=e2b6bd7ffba3476a4903b4e2ac8f809bba6077ee29b304b2d07cfd8bacda0237\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">phoenixnewtimes.com/best...</a>)   I knew I wanted tacos, so I went with the mix and match 3 tacos with beans and rice plate. For my tacos I went with Aztec Tinga Taco, Oaxaca black mole chicken taco and the La Santisima specialty taco.  The Aztec Tinga Taco was tender juicy shredded chicken with tomato, onion and Aztec chipotle salsa. The Oaxaca black mole chicken taco was a blend of spices, chilis, nuts and chocolate made in to this rich flavorful sauce that was mixed with shredded chicken. The La Santisima specialty taco had steak, toasted Oaxaca cheese, mushrooms, poblano peppers, onions, garlic and salsa.  While all three tacos were great and flavorful, I am still dreaming about the mole, omg the mole is soo amazing, I need more of it in my life.  The salsa bar is still on point with lots of variety. Never a bad meal at La Santisima. Need to go back asap for that mole.",

    "text": "I decided to come to AZ to visit family and this was my only night here, so I decided to try some Mexican food. I spent about 45min trying to find a great place to eat and this restaurant had amazing reviews on yelp which I for the most part trust, so I was super excited to try it out.   We'll start with the good bc I think that's most fair. The refried beans were pretty good and they have a salsa bar with all different kinds of salsa which I found to be pretty unique.  Other than that, I was extremely disappointed in my visit. It cost $45 for 2 quesos and two sets of tacos. Fair warning, you CANNOT mix the street taco mix and match plate with any of the specialty tacos even thought the menu clearly states \"add any tacos from below to the mix and match plate for an extra charge\", and next to each specialty taco is the charges of 50 cents-$2. We had a take out order and specifically asked how much two street tacos and one of the specialty tacos were and they said an extra .50. Turns out we get there and they charged me for the \"gourmet taco\" plate which was an extra $5 (in addition to the specialty taco fee) than the street tacos because I had ordered ONE specialty taco.  They first tried to tell me I had ordered gourmet tacos. Thinking this was my mistake I apologized then read them off my order I had on my phone and when I realized they were in fact on the street taco plate, they then said \"oh you can't add on gourmet tacos to the street tacos\" and I said ok that's fine. I guess I'll pay an extra $5 thinking they had spiced up my street tacos bc I was now paying for a gourmet plate. Unfortunately, these tacos were the same as the other set of just street tacos we had ordered. I could have gotten ALL gourmet tacos for the same price. My tacos were bland and even the salsas didn't do much which made paying extra even worse. The rice on the side was also mushy and overcooked.  Lastly, I was thinking oh well it's hard to make a bad queso, so it's good we had ordered that. I was expecting some great queso with it being $9. This again was not the case. The queso was completely solidified and we had to reheat it twice while eating to make it even dip-able with chips. I have ordered fantastic take out queso, so I didn't see that as an excuse for bad queso. Again, super bland and not sure goat cheese was even in it because that has a particular taste that I love.  I am definitely NOT coming back here again. Perhaps it was just my own particular experience with this food and yours could be great but if you want a great food experience with the abundance of options here in Phoenix, I wouldn't even risk coming here.",

I kept going back for the pico and the jicama.  My group shared two plates of the Mix & Match gourmet and street tacos. Each Mix & Match order comes with 3 tacos and rice and beans. I ordered the Pacific White Fish gourmet taco and Carne Arrachera street taco. If I had to choose one, I'd go for the Pacific White Fish again. I don't like cabbage, but the cabbage and sauce is what made it for me. That and the fresh, crispy juiciness of the fish.  Loved the food, the service and the decor.",

Fried large corn tortillas with yummy tender steak and cheese inside.  Wish I had room to eat the whole huge thing!  Also sangria was a work of art.  And totally reasonably priced.  Plus really nice people. So happy I followed yelp to this wonderful place!",

Downside was the paper lined baskets and plastic utensils for eating. I'd go back but didn't leave raving like so many others.",

Noticed two dirty tables were available while we waited, those 2 dirty tables only sat 2.   Decent food, probably an 8/10.  Those 2 dirty tables were never cleaned until we finished eating.  By the time we were done eating 6 groups of people were waiting outside and there were 6 dirty tables waiting to be cleaned for these 6 people.  Only 10 total table in this place and they are making people wait 30 minutes just so they can get around to cleaning them.  Customers kept coming in and they would tell them 25 minute wait.   As a customer eating in the restaurant this will drive you nuts and make your experience a 4/10 and not want to come back.  Just because they make people wait outside in the heat when tables are sitting dirty for 30 minutes.",

It's pretty damned good ($3 delicious margaritas and $2 chicken tinga or carne asada tacos).  To start, there is the salsa bar. You get one basket of chips (any more than that you pay for, but my wife and I never eat more than 1 basket-full) and then there are about 16-20 different types of salsa and sauces to try. I've only been brave enough to try about 5 of them, and they've all been decent-really good. My favorite was their tomatillo, and their chipotle didn't really do it for me, but I don't usually enjoy the taste of chipotle peppers in general. Too smokey. The first time I went I got 2 carne asada tacos and 1 chicken tinga taco. I was disappointed in the carne asada. The meat was dry and topped with dry shredded cabbage. It has a decent flavor, but I had to put salsa on it because it was too dry for me. The chicken tinga, on the other hand, was pretty fabulous. The chicken has a very flavorful sauce on it with good spice, and it's topped with pickled red onion. Fantastic. I also had a plate of rice and beans which were delicious as well. So, the second time I went in, I ordered only chicken tacos. No biggie. I highly recommend checking this place out. 5 tacos, 2 margaritas, and some rice and beans for $20. Brilliant.",

I've had tacos, burritos, and quesas (think thicker, deep fried quesadilla) and have never been disappointed.  I really love the tacos because you can get two tacos with rice and beans for about 10 bucks and be completely filled. Their horchata is really delicious and soaked in nuts and fruit for an interesting take on typical horchata. They make an AMAZING spicy margarita and a magnificent michelada---I can't even tell you how great they are. Of course, their salsa bar is my favorite part of this restaurant: 15 salsas that are unique and flavorful. The only reason I give this a 4 instead of 5 is because the last few times I have come (at varying times/days), they have been swamped and they only have 2 waiters. I recognize the space is really tiny (only about 8 or 9 tables and the bar counter) but there's also no real waiting area, which can get annoying in the summer.",

    "text": "I can't believe I haven't written a review for La Condesa yet.  I have never been disappointed here.  Ever.    Here is the deal:    -you start with a side of chips.  And then you get to feast on the humongous salsa bar.  My favorites are the pecan (creamy, thick, and with a kick at the end), cilantro (thinner but delicious), and the tamarindo (sweet and spicy).  Sadly, the tamarindo one seems to be quite elusive and is not always available.  You could spend hours trying all the different salsas.  I agree though with Iain, the peanut was the weak link.  -next comes the real food.  I have only had the tacos, but I imagine everything to be of the same quality.  So these tacos come with double tortillas to hold all the ingredients.  These aren't skimpy by any means.  Two should be sufficient for most people.  The Cabo Shrimp is amazing.  Huge shrimp beer battered with a creamy sauce on top.  The chicken mole taco was also great with that special chocolately flavor to it.  Today, I tried to Mayan Cochinita taco and it was stuffed to the brim with tender as can be pork.  I have had the rice and beans before with a combo and I would say the beans are better than the rice.  Though in my opinion after four or so visits, it's best to come enjoy the chips and salsa and then indulge in two tacos.  This place is really hard to find, but if you find Palm and McDowell, it's right there with a few parking spots along the street.  If you like tacos, you need to come here.  It's just that simple.",

We sat down and were brought menus and chips.  I tried most of their salsas.  They all had their own very unique flavor.  the peanut salsa was really interesting.  My favorite was their tomatillo salsa.    I ordered the Oaxaca Mole taco and a carne asada taco.  The mole was excellent with great flavor.  The carne asada was bland and flavorless...huh?  I dumped salsa on the carne asada taco and when finished was rather disappointed in that particular offering.  Also ordered their calabacitas.  They were seasoned well and tasted great.    I had a bite of my partner's pork taco and it was amazing.    I am glad we found La Condesa and I will definitely visit again to try some more of their menu offerings.",

My poblem with it is it only comes in one size--32 ounces, which is like two meals for me.  2. The salsa bar...never knew there could be so many kinds of salsa! That alone is an adventure in taste-testing. My personal fave is the jicama one, which really is more of a relish but who's checking.   3. Chicken mole and pibil...they do it right. Their mole could be a bit spicier for my taste but that's what the salsas are there for. I had the chicken mole as a taco and the pibil as a burro (separate occasion, alright, don't think I'm a pig now).  It's a great date place, I think. It's small, it's quaint, in a good neighborhood, and the satffers are very friendy.   I love this place so much that I didn't even care about the tiny creature scurrying across the floor near the front door. That's  not their fault though. That was just an unfortunate situation. Not a reflection of them.  So try it.",

The quality is always top notch.  I did the artwork too!  Two negatives...The music can sometimes be loud, and sometimes they are REALLY packed and parking is a bit tough to find.  Other than that, I HIGHLY recommend!",

Forget what you learned in Rocky Point, this place is legit' They have a salsa bar with 12 - 15 totally original flavors that could get you by solely on the chips and dip.  Do not come here and not order some form of their special pork (I cannot spell it).  Quesadilla is the star, you will have never had one this style.  Tacos are great (carne asade or the pork preferred).  Burritos are ho-hum.  First-timers must order the Horchata drink offering.  It does not dissapoint!",

Cochinita Pibil that tastes like Cochinita Pibil... though I would be fine with a little more achiote. The tinga is great, with citrusy notes on top of slow cooked beef full of chorizo and onion flavor--don't worry, the onion sweetens it up.  My personal favorite is the baja shrimp taco. Big juicy pieces of breaded shrimp stuffed into two corn tortillas with cabbage and mayo on top.  My only point of contention; they should warn people that more than two tacos is actually quite a lot of food. It would help get over the sticker shock. Beans and rice are unnecessary.  A suggestion: Provide people with suggestions for salsa/taco pairings and make everyone drink the fruity horchata, it's awesome.",

I had plans to bring one friend here who is Dia De Los Muertos obsessed.  She blew me off, but I was so looking forward to it, I talked two other friends into joining me to check out a new spot.  The gal is a jamiaca fiend, and was thrilled with the drink.  Having read reviews on the size of the horchata, I convinced the guy to share one with me, we could always get another if we needed it.  (We didn't)  WOW - no other horchata will ever measure up!  Yes, the salsa bar ROCKED!  We sampled 6 or 7 of them.  I could live off the jicama, cilantro, jalepeno and lime tastiness!  And the hot red one that looked greasy had the most amazing heat/flavor ratio I could imagine ever encountering.  Truly, the acme salsa!  Being indecisive, I went a la carte with the tacos.  One each of the cochinita pibil, one chicken mole and one carne asada. I was busy having a foodgasm with the cochinita when the gal freaked on her carne asada, making the guy have some - and they both agreed it is better than America's Taco Shop!  (Mine had to sit and wait while I was having quality alone time with the last bites of the pork.)  I will say I wasn't thrilled with the mole.  This is NOT a knock on how La Condesa does it - and if you're a mole fan, it may be amazing.  I'd never actually had mole - turns out I am just not a fan of the overall flavor.  But I love almost all Mexican food, and I love chocolate!  How is this possible!  Two rights making a wrong?  Weird!  That said...I will be back.  Over and over!  This is definitely on the short list of places to have a quick, great meal in my hood!",

From traditional carne asada, pollo asada, carnitas, to exotics like fish and shark tacos... it's FANTASTIC! The price is fair and their menu is pretty large.  The place is definitely not Scottsdale. It's a small place and looks kinda dirty.  They have the whole \"Day of the Dead\" theme going on.  It's an odd looking place but trust me, these are the kind of places where you will find the most authentic food.  They also have a small bar to serve up some nice cocktails and beers.  Their chips are very good and they have a salsa bar with over 14 different salsas. I'm glad my friend recommended this place to me.  I look forward to visiting often.  It's sure is a LOT closer than driving to Mexicali for the same tacos! :)  Advise:  The seating is limited, so if you arrive at the traditional week day noon lunch rush, expect to wait for a table.

Ordered Azteca Tinga and Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken tacos, but oddly, was served Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco instead of the Azteca. I double-checked with the server 'cuz the Cochinita was absolutely mouth-watering! Over-the-top when paired with the Cilantro salsa (just a touch). A definite repeat item. Black Mole was certainly delivered as described, with dark, somewhat smokey-molasses flavor, but a bit too heavy for me.

The absolute, takes the cake reason for 5 stars is the Horchata! I am a fan of Horchata. I have never had Horchata like this! 32 ounces with what must have been muddled strawberries and apples and fresh ground cinnamon. So good, so good.",

Lots of things to choose from on the menu. Loved my chicken mole burro. Margs were delicious and I cannot wait to do happy hour there - an afternoon of $3 margaritas and the amazing salsa bar with a great variety of salsas. I particularly liked the pecan, peanut, and chile arbol salsas, although they were all really, really good. If you love horchata, you'll love the one here.",

They come spilling over with grilled veggies and cheese.  They are amazing.  The salsa bar offers a huge variety of different salsa including unique salsas made from fruit (strawberry) and nuts (pecan).  I took away a star because the seating is super tight and it is hard to move around in there.  The seats themselves are really uncomfortable (heavy wooden chairs).  I agree with a previous reviewers that I can do without their rice and beans.  But the tacos are so filling, you will not need them.",

Mixing and matching with the unique salsas (peanut, pecan, cilantro and jicama salsas are standouts) allows for some pretty awesome flavor combinations.  Sort of an odd place, because it the menu feels like it should be a takeout or order-and-take your seat kind of place, but it has a beautiful wood bar that seems wasted on the environment.  If they do carry beer, it isn't in an obvious place (no taps, no display refridgerator).  And they appear to only carry one type of wine.  Just think of the drinks as afterthoughts and enjoy the variety of food you are able to enjoy...",

My husband ordered a quesadilla one time and it was delicious but I need my tacos, the shrimp ones are my faves with the chicken mole coming in second.  Vanessa (I assume this is her name from other reviews) has one of the prettiest smiles I have ever seen!

It's one of those hidden gems along 16th Street and I really wish I could give it five stars but I just can't. Here's my summary of the place:  Good: -The tacos are delicious! My favorite is the Mayan Pibil taco.  -The prices are pretty descent. -The salsa bar is AMAZING! I can't get enough of the pecan salsa.  -The chips are free and they go fast with such great salsa selections. -The margaritas are tasty.  Bad: -The service is really bad. I'm not they type of customer to really care too much about service at a restaurant but it's pretty ridiculous here. I took my bf here the other day and it took about 8 minutes before anyone came to the table to greet us. I would say this was a fluke but, unfortunately, it's happened a few times now. Also, I have had two occasions when they forgot to bring out silverware/napkins. I've had a couple times when they've forgotten to bring out my margarita (they're really good here btw) and one time when they brought it out looking like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for 10 minues (all of the ice was melted). It's really sad how bad the services is because I absolutely LOVE the food/atmosphere.  I guess the bottom line is that La Condesa makes some amazing gourmet tacos and salsa but they fall very short on the service. I'll be back but there are plenty of other places I can go and receive great food AND great service (i.e. Gallo Blanco at the Clarendon Hotel).",

    "text": "We go here at least every few weeks. Very Authentic.  The prices are pretty average. I do wish that they had some bigger bowl of salsa as they give you these small little tester cups to try their salsa bar out with. You also have to pay for your second bowl of chips which isn't exactly ideal. This place is usually very very busy. I believe they had a bench to sit outside and wait. The staff doesn't seem to have any sort of order or manager there to help them out. You definitely will sit at your table for at least 15 minutes before minutes before being asked what you want to drink and then get your drinks probably 15 minutes after that.  The staff may ask you if you would like to order your meal enchilada  style but just a heads up- it costs an additional five dollars or more to make this happen. I think they should let people know that as they are ordering or add that price on the menu.  Overall we love this place because the food is so good but we do think they could make a few changes to benefit their business and customers. Update: Ate here again as we do every few weeks, the service is TERRIBLE but the food is delicious. The place was not very busy but again, the service was the worst service you've probably ever experienced. Not a place to go if you are in a rush, with guests or if you are trying to accommodate etc. we sat at the table ready to go with drinks empty for a solid 20 minutes at least. They need to hire a manager and get this staff up to speed on acceptable service.",

I also tried the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, I found this flavor strong (unlike other Mexican places I have tried), so that is good, but I didn't really care for it.  The bad, my son ordered the steak Quesa. He didn't care for it at all, I did like this, but then the waitress took the entire thing away when we weren't done with it and Dave didn't even get a chance to try it.

No place to just wait and hangout, unless you want to wait outside. But they turnover tables pretty quickly. Best thing about this place was the salsa bar--so many varieties. My favorite tacos were the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Tacos...hands down!",

Ok so this spot is in a sketchy part of phoenix. That's the first thing I noticed when I got off the freeway. Transients mostly around BUT I've learned that the best food spots come from restaurants that are in places you wouldn't think to go. Hence the term HIDDEN GEM.  It's SUPER small here. Luckily it wasn't too busy. But it's literally a small box of a restaurant. It looks like it can hold up to 25 people safely.   I ordered a carne asada burrito, chicken taco and one of the houses popular burritos. I can't remember the name of it but it was delicious!! My burrito had lettuce, tomatoes and their own house sauce. It was so delicious! My burrito is on steroids!! It was so big too!! You have to come try this spot out if your near Phoenix!",

It was hard to watch her struggle as the two groups in front of us left after waiting for 20 minutes. The kicker is that it was not even packed. There was about 10 tables open and she made four groups wait for over 20+ minutes. She needs to be trained or let go.  The waiter was stressed out and could not remember something you said to here a few seconds ago. I ordered a Coke and horchata a total of three times. We only got the horchata as we were leaving...... The horchata was delicious though....  We ordered around 8 street tacos of different varieties and they were all A+. The selection of salsa was also very good. You can tell that they are understaffed and struggle with giving good service.  We thought we would try some tequila and the waiter brought us house tequila which tasted like cleaning materials. We then ordered the $15 Don Julio tequila and she brought back out the same house tequila..  Even though the service was terrible I would come back for the food.",

I ordered a michelada after seeing the pictures of it here on yelp (which let me add that the michelada was not even on the menu) and that thing costs $12 dollars... for 1 beer and some clamato juice in it!  I saw of bunch of plaques on the well for \"best of....\" this and best of that, including a 2012 \"cheap eats of phoenix\". I interpret that plaque as something having to do with \"low prices\" however, it seems like the restaurant totally moved away from low cost!  taking away the cost factor, i think the food is good. i ordered a Marlin, Cochinita Pibil and barbacoa taco which were all great and my wife ordered a \"lonche\" with skirt steak which was also good. the salsa bar does have great salsas but they're watered down... it can't even be scooped, you can only \"wet\" your chips in it and if you add it to your food be ready for your tortilla or lonche to fall apart ... they might as well serve the salsa on a cup with a straw so you can sip on it as you eat!  There's one plaque that this restaurant deserves to have on the wall... the one that says \"Best use of a small space\" tables are so close to one another, it gets really crammed in there.

Lots of flavors to pick from and most were just the right amount of spicy.   You really can't go wrong on the menu here. The burros (get them enchilada style) and the fried quesadillas are probably the most popular things and I'd recommend either of them.   The reason I'm only giving 3 stars is because the service was extremely underwhelming. They were clearly understaffed (which seems to be a common theme for this restaurant), but it was extremely difficult to get hold of our waitress and we waiting close to 50 minutes for our food.",

The Tlaloc was yummy but made with too much oil, I had grease dripping down my hands while eating it. The oil was a definite turn off and 1/5 of it would have sufficed to pan-fry the veggies.

We pulled up and were very skeptical by the look of the outside, but we were greeted right away to pick a table. We both got the Cabo Shrimp Taco and a steak taco and it had this amazing fried cheese in it. And the salsa bar was amazing. I think the Cilantro salsa was my favorite. The beans and rice were also to die for. The shrimp in my taco were so delicious. I couldn't get over how amazing this place was. We happened to go for happy hour and got $5 Grapefruit margaritas as well. BEST MEXICAN FOOD EVER. I wish there was one in California.   P.S- Everyone around us ordered a quesadilla because they are stuffed inside their homemade tortillas and deep fried. Can't wait to go back and try these.   The service was awesome, too!",

My boyfriend asked for a local beer from tap and called it by the brewery name instead of the beer name and that apparently confused them even though it was the only Huss beer they had up there (never has that happen to us before at other places since every beer tap has the brewery name). The thing I hated most was that they don't split the bill by the individual if asked. Only way to split it is by splitting it in half, which sucks if the other person orders more than you. Luckily, we basically ordered the same thing so half worked for us. The tacos were yummy so that made up for everything else, however they weren't yummy enough for us to want to deal with that again.",

    "text": "First off thank you fellow Yelpers for leading me here!!   So far I've been here twice and I will definitely be back...again...and again...and again! ((And again)) Both visits were for lunch, round one was a to go order of Al Pastor street tacos ** we will start here.   I walked in (the fancy shmancy wooden doors next to the Tienda) and it was jam packed. And this was around 2:30 on a weekday and it really is a little restaurant AND the character and ambiance are unique. So inviting. Anyway, I first attempted to order the Asada tacos...then mole however they were sold out .... Hence the al pastor. The flavors were amazing. They weren't (in my opinion) traditional, however they were delicious and I WILL order them again in the future.   My second visit was a sit down lunch around 1:00 on a Wednesday with the hubs. We were able to sit, eat, and relax before my one hour lunch was finished. So they are very quick!! The place got packed closer to 2:00 by people of all ages which is a really good sign. Anyway, I ordered the black mole tacos and the hubs got a trio street taco plate. *{Holy Moly}* Yelpers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Everything this restaurant serves could be considered magical bursts of flavors that rock your Mind!!!   Just come here and eat. The food is to die for. The salsa bar is something to be rivaled and their margaritas look heavenly (I need to go when I'm off the clock!!)  //cheers//",

After waiting 20 minutes, seeing plenty of empty tables and still not seated,  we watched one of the workers throw down two big bags of ice (to bust the cubes loose) onto the floor. Then the bags were opened, lifted, laid on the bin, and raised up until empty, shaking all the ice into the open bin.   here's the problem - - The bag protects the ice, but as soon as it is thrown on the floor, the outside of the bag gets contaminated.  The floor they were thrown on was already soaking wet, in a very dark area behind the bar.  After I witnessed this huge mistake, it made me think we should just leave. So we did but I told them why. The person in charge pretty much brushed me off, and the bag-dropping guy mentioned how it's \"just the bag\"... that got dirty...  I didn't feel any change would really take place after pointing out what we just saw, and how the guy so casually brushed off my concern. Wow!  We've been here five times before, and I'm wondering what kind of sanitation problems they have in the kitchen, where nobody can see, if they so openly soil the ice in my drink.   Disgraceful.  I trusted them, but now I don't.",

It is always delicious and incredibly satisfying, and the salsa bar (especially the pecan salsa) is friggin' capital A Amazing.  I also really enjoy the atmosphere, and the servers themselves are great.  However, every time I visit I notice that the speed of service is slower.  Today was by far the longest wait, at almost an hour to order and get our food.  They've also recently expanded, so their dining area is roughly 3x the size it used to be (which definitely puts a dent on the already long wait time).  In the end, I'll keep coming back.  The food is worth it.  However, I really hope this isn't a precurser to negative changes for this restaurant.  It would be such a waste of a great thing.",

You can't even get a sip with something coming up your straw. Also ABSOLUTLEY not worth 5$ !!!! FAIL   To eat I got 3 Tacos (Carne Asada & Chicken Tinga) and rice and beans The carne asada tacos were basic and tasted the same as any other place . I did enjoy the tinga taco it had a lot of flavor but nothing was good enough that would make me want to come back.  My boyfriend got a deep fried carne asada quesadilla that he said was \"good\" but nothing amazing.   All in All it's all hype  You can get better tacos and Horchata at Ta Carbon!",

Sadly, since coming here they decided to expand their restaurant. With clear notions that they have zero clue how to run that many tables. Seeing 8 people waiting over 40 min to be seated with more than 8 chairs available is not how you run a business. Considering I've run a successful restaurant with about 5 times the amount of capacity, one must consider an expansion before making one. Being understaffed and the kitchen being behind is absolutely zero excuse for letting people stand and wait to be seated while your kitchen catches up when the room for seats is available. I'm seriously appalled with this place after the last two times being here. If you're going to have the audacity to add $$ to your prices then justify it with the knowledge to know how to take care of your customers. Here's a tip. Tell your servers to seat people and offer them chips and perhaps a drink on the house if it is in fact the houses fault for being behind. Probably will not spend a dime here anymore which is sad considering I thought they had the best burrito in Phoenix. Get your kitchen together. Best of luck.",

Even the physical menus can be different. The one I had had a few more items on it than my friends'. The horchata is still the best I've ever had. The margaritas are so freaking good.  I tried the marlin taco that wasn't there last time I visited. I love trying things I've never had before. Marlin is an odd fish. Their preparation makes it look and taste almost like pork. It's just... different. Still good though!  My friend got the veggie burro. She said it was pretty tasty, but a little on the bland side. We agreed that it can be hard to make vegetarian food flavorful at times. She liked the salsa bar because she could add a different flavor between bites.  They get slammed on weekends. I was here at 7pm on a Friday. They need more than 2 people serving and clearing on weekends. When every table is packed there's almost no room to move. Getting to the salsa bar can be pretty awkward.",

It can sometimes be difficult to find solid mexican food, but this place nails it, bringing dishes from various regions in mexico, but mostly central and southern.  The salsa bar is fun, it is great to find a dish you like and experiment with new salsas. The negative of the place is also its charm, but it is small and usually very busy, so expect a 10-15 minute wait.  My favorites are the burritos, with a grapefruit margarita.",

But not the best in my opinion, no place like Mexico could ever offer amazing Horchata to me thus far, nothing like the one's you'll find at street taco stands late at night in places like Cuernavaca, Chihuahua, Mexico city and or Acapulco!  _ Anyways, coming back to La Condesa this place is super tiny, and should consider expanding to make it a bit more comfy, just my opinion!  The taco platter I had included the Carne Asada , Pacific Fish and Cochinita Pibil taco. All three were okay, and just okay. The rice and bean were also A-ok, nothing too extravagant nor elaborate. I really think this taco shop could do better, they have the potential to, like their amazing salsa bar is a huge kudos to consider, and the staff too so you got that down Condesa, Keep up the good work and plenty of room for improvement if you care to know!",

Didn't think it would be busy since it was a little to early for dinner and late for lunch but we're we wrong. Had to wait only a minute or so for someone to leave and a table to open up but this place had people coming in non stop. My wife and I split 6 different tacos that the waiter recommended. All very good. Favorite two were the steak called something else and the shrimp. Those two were unbelievably good. Steak was super tender and shrimp tasted very fresh. Very well seasoned. The other tacos we tried were all good too but not as good as the two listed above iny my opinion. We both also had their house Margarita which was fantastic. Definately will come back. My new favorite mexican place for tacos.",

The fish taco was juicy and flavorful; one of the best fish tacos I have had.  hUbby also like his steak taco.  The salsas were low, a tribute to their goodness.  Once they got filled up, we helped ourselves to Jicama, guac, cilantro and tomatillo salsa.  tHe guac salsa has a good kick to it so beware.  We ate all the free chips.

I love the rice it's got flavor to it and the horchata was very delicious! It's got fruit, cinnamon and nuts on top. Ok, so I didn't know it was big! I think the cup was 32oz, it's good for 2-3 people!!! The down side was the service..I don't know if the lady was stressed out because there's a lot of people and there's only 2 of them serving.. But they need to add more server/waiter during peak hours.. The guy was doing 3 jobs, at the bar, cashier and serving as well. I feel bad for them. We were waiting for our food for a long time, probably 30-40mins. When we got out of the restaurant, there was a lot of people waiting.. I will definitely come back again, just not peak hours.",

The tacos are the best item on the menu, and the quesadillas are a close second, in my opinion.  This is not the typical Az-Mex quesadilla.  It's deep fried and incredibly delicious.  I'd go with anything including arrachera.  The salsa bar is as good as hyped here on Yelp.  My personal favorites are the cilantro, the pecan, the peanut, and the strawberry (when they have it).  A couple of great typical molcajete blends are there too.  Don't miss the house margarita.  The happy hour price of a few bucks is a total steal.  It's a ruby red grapefruit blend, and it's absolutely delicious (and well worth it even at the regular price).  You can eat like a king with a huge helping of food, great salsas, a quesadilla to split, have a margarita, and walk out for $15-20 per person including tip.  Delicious food and one of the best places on Calle 16.",

I always eat out when the general public isn't out in force, and I love going to La Condesa in the middle of the afternoon on weekdays.  Many good restaurants have the afternoon restaurant \"limbo\" period where they close until dinner, but it's great that this place doesn't.    Every single thing I've tried there is so good I wind up benchmarking most other Mexican-style restaurants against La Condesa.  Starting with their tortilla chips and salsa, the chips are always super fresh, and their salsa bar is the best I've ever seen; all home/hand-made gourmet salsas, TWELVE in all, obviously all made fresh.  Each one by itself is incredibly great, while I have about 5 favorites I always focus on.    I got addicted to their mole sauce.  That's surprising for me because I'm not a big chocolate fan at all, and the first time I saw mole sauce, just the idea sickened me!  Plus the first time I tried it, the person who made it really didn't know what they were doing -- but that all did a serious about-face once I tried La Condesa's.  It's hard to not order their mole chicken, but if you want to try another truly interesting and great gourmet taco, burro, or bowl, try their Pork al Pastor, it'll blow you away too.  I recently tried it burro style, and with some fresh tortilla chips and a half dozen cups of various salsas, it was almost too much to eat -- I chose to just have ice water with the meal, and the whole tab came to about $9-bucks.  Even when you just want water they bring you a glass filled with ice and lime wedges, and a stopper-type liter sized bottle of ice cold water.    Service is always fantastic too.  There isn't a whole lot of room in the place, maybe 15 tables and bar seating as well, which is why I also like going there when the crowds aren't around.  They're open for breakfast on Saturday's and Sunday's, I haven't been there during those times but I'd bet my bottom dollar they make a killer Huevos Rancheros!    This is certainly a must visit restaurant if you haven't eaten there before -- I almost don't want to write such a great review because they do enough business as it is, and I don't want to ruin one of my favorite places to go!  I'm picky, but not unrealistically so -- it's not often I'll write a 1-star review, and the same goes for 5-stars.  This place is absolutely a solid FIVE STAR restaurant, hands down IMHO.",

    "text": "What else is there to say about La Condesa that hasn't been said in the hundred other 5 star reviews of this place?  Not much, so I'll just add the following for extra emphasis...  1. The tacos.  Oh the tacos...  even living out in California, the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark tacos are made of dreams and sunshine and sugar plum fairies.  If sugar plum fairies came in the shape of delicious, beer batter fried dogfish shark pieces.  With just a little cream sauce and lettuce so you don't miss out on any of the shark.  And the Cochinita Pibil tacos... there's fall off the bone tender, then there's meat that's pretty much as  close to melting as meat can get.  But these are just my favorites... I've tried all the tacos on the menu, and they're all delicious.  2. The salsa bar.  If I can give this place any criticism, it's that they run out of salsas far too often.  Late in the day.  Just before they close.  Look... sometimes I'm in a peanut salsa mood, sometimes I'm in a chipotle salsa mood, sometimes I'm in a strawberry salsa mood.  I can't help it.  3. The horchata.  Just order it.  It's big.  Bring guests.  Share it.  I come here far too often for someone that lives 1000 miles away.  Love it.",

After reading numerous articles we decided to check it out on Friday night. To begin with the restaurant is small and loud. We decide to get our food to go instead of waiting. Our order was messed up, I received a meat taco when I ordered something else (I don't eat meat). The rice is congealed and sticky and bland and the beans are runny and unbeatable. I was very disappointed with the customer service and the experience overall. We will not be back.",

With a salsa bar in the corner, we were given chips and first tried 3 different salsas. We ordered two types of tacos and a chicken mole quesadilla to share. The tacos were good, and the quesadilla was like a fluffy fried calzone. Absolutely delicious! The only bump was the fact I ordered my taco with no mushrooms and it came with them, but I didn't mind that much.   My husband had a hornitos margarita which was good as well. Next time we're in Phoenix we will certainly be back!",

Finally, someone stopped to look and told me that they couldn't figure out who took my order so they couldn't pull up the order on their POS system. You can imagine what cold tacos and burritos taste like.  The salsas are the best ever; they serve them on a salsa bar and let you pick the ones you want. However, there were no lids for the containers for take out...  If you go there, expect to wait; it is popular. Expect slow service. Expect good food.",

From Hot! to exotic.  I could just go in for chips and salsa bar and savor one of the jalapeno, cilantro margaritas! Caution, they use fresh jalapenos so sometimes they are much spicier than others.  My friend loved the tamarind margarita.   Prices look high but you get a lot for the money.  Their burritos are HUGE and most of the tacos are made with full size double corn tortillas. There are many choices to fit all tastes.  However, I would not recommend the fish tacos.  I ordered the baja style and could not eat it.  It tasted as if it had been frozen for a long long time.  The other tacos tried were very good.   Our last trip in, there were 4 of us, no problem getting a table on Friday at 4pm but the service was terrible..  Not sure if they were breaking in new staff or what.  In three visits, I knew their menu better than the waiter did and he had no knowledge of their \"special house margaritas\".  Service as really slow and they kept making mistakes on the drink orders.    I will give them another try.",

The mole quesadilla with chicken is delicious as is the horchata which delightfully has cinnamon, fruit and chopped nuts to accent the flavor. The prices have gone up, which is a pity. The expansion next door has opened up the space which makes seating easier though you still have to wait a bit too long to get your order (worth it though...the food is delicious) Still love the artwork and decor which is based on Mexican La Lllorona and Day of the Dead themes. Alan our waiter was fantastic, personable, and hard working. Would give place 5 stars if they could just get more efficient between seating time and getting served the meal.",

Glass and presentation was beautiful but it was extremely sweet and I could not taste the tequila. Triple Sec is supposed to add the sweet, not tons is simple syrup laden weak fruit juice. Salsas were tasty but a little watered down. I'd rather have 5 or even 2 awesome salsas than 12 not so good ones. Some weren't even labeled. Tacos were good but fish and shrimp were deep fried, I was expecting grilled. Their signature taco was excellent. I'd like to give 2 stars but if I haven't ordered margaritas it's 3.",

The servers were attentive throughout the night. :D  That said: I love the idea of a salsa bar but I wasn't a fan of all of them. Personal taste.  Their food was awesome! It didn't need the salsas at all. I ordered three different gourmet tacos with beans and rice. All of them unique and on point.  Plus, I ended up with a food coma. Enough said.",

There are no televisions or loud music to distract you from good conversation and good food. Parking is quite tight but don't let that detour you! A solid 8/10. Only \"complaint\" is the dish called the \"Mexican Flag\". If you don't like nuts and sweet dried fruit in your tacos, don't order this dish. Took us a little off guard lol  Highly recommend!",

From the amazing salsa bar to the great fish tacos, the food here was very, very good. As many have mentioned, the salsa bar has many options to choose from and each has its own authentic flare. For lunch today I ordered the carne asada and shark taco, that came with beans and rice. The fish and carna were so flavorful. In my opinion, you know when you are eating good Mexican food based on how tasty a fish taco is and theirs was great. To go with my meal I ordered their horchata that many yelpers have raved about. I love horchata but sadly I can not list theirs as a favorite. I am more of a simple guy when it comes to this speciality drink and having pecans and strawberries in it just was a little much for me. You may ask how I could still give it five stars but if you had the opportunity to try all of the other items that I tasted they more than made up for it. Overall, very good food and a place that I will definitely be going to in the future. There are many seafood dishes that I look forward to enjoying in the future.",

You'd have to know where it is though, because the tourists are not going to accidentally stumble upon it.  It's in the middle of the hood in Phoenix.  The only thing setting it apart from the other old-school business fronts with barred windows is the giant mosaic Day of the Dead Catrina above the door.  Known as a \"gourmet taco place\" to locals, the menu also features burros and quesadillas.  Where else can you get a shark soft taco or a Mahi Mahi burro?  I have no idea, but you can get them here.  My husband loved his Mahi Mahi burro.  I had a more traditional Carne Asada soft taco.  All their flour tortillas are hand made, and fresh.  And did I mention the salsa bar?  About 20 different kinds of salsa for you to try, with the chips that keep coming to the table.  My favorite was the creamy cilantro one.  There are also peanut and pecan based salsas, so those with nut allergies, take note.  You may not expect nuts in your food, so pay attention.  Seating is limited, (maybe 10 tables) and the restaurant was full when we were there, for lunch, in the middle of the week.  If you have a group larger than 4, it would probably be wise to call ahead.  Parking is also limited, just the few spaces on the street in front.  The only slightly disconcerting element was the giant mural of Frida Khalo.  It's a little odd to be stared at by a giant portrait of a mustached woman while eating such wonderful food.  We liked it so much that my husband took my dad there.  My dad is a notoriously finicky eater (which means I probably came by it naturally), and he is still talking about it a week later.  Yum!",

I did take out and while waiting saw all of the dishes come out to the customers.  Everything looked amazing.  I can't wait to return and try some of the other items.  The salsa bar was amazing with over 12 choices of different salsa.  I mixed the guacamole (hot) and cilantro (mild)  salsa and it was one of the best that I have ever tried with the perfect level of spice for me.  You can't miss this place.  Thanks again for a great meal.",

My hubby got the horchada with rum...it tasted like a pina colada! Yum yum.

The menu was bigger than expected and sounded pretty authentic. They have a full bar which was a plus as I was in mood for some tequila. I had the smoked marlin tacos and slow cooked pork tacos..both were incredibly flavorful and excellent. Not the best I have ever eaten but darn close and I have had a lot of great tacos in my travels. The only disappointment was I was hoping to also get a chile reano, sadly they don't offer them. I'll go back for sure when I am in Phoenix.",

I received some chips as I left the order counter and stopped at the salsa bar to get some pico de gallo.  When I got to my table I scooped some pico onto my tortilla chip and wow, what great fresh taste!  I also had some tomatillo, jicama and chipotle salsas that I tried on my tacos.  The shark taco was good and the cochinita pibil was even better.  Even the small cups of rice and beans where really good.  I grabbed a menu on my way out and am already trying to plan what I'll have on my next visit.  I especially can't wait to try the horchata.",

To me, it didn't have much of a flavor to it unless it was drowned in the salsa from the salsa bar. Was going to order a strawberry horchata to go but every time we asked for something, the waitress took a while to come back (she only came back in a hurry when it was time to pick up the money), so I said forget it. I won't be back but at least I can say I went.",

It is a True diamond in the rough part of phoenix. I ordered the carne asada burrito which is simply meat and beans. Anywhere else that would be boring and plain, but it was seasoned perfectly and full of flavor. A perfect vessel for the salsa bar from heaven. Every bite was different depending on what spicy concoction I chose. I also couldn't resist trying the maya conchita pibil taco, which was packed full of juicy shredded pork. So juicy in fact that I had to eat it quick because the corn tortillas were getting a bit soggy. Did I mind? Oh no. I just sopped up any juice left and sighed with pure contentment. They topped the taco with nothing else but pickled red onions that were delicious. Simple done right.  Can't wait to go back and get that horchata!",

The place is just too small and they should change their policy of not letting you order anything until seated.",

    "text": "La Condesa Gourmet Taco Shop   After a long break from Yelp, I knew that eventually I would find myself in a situation where I could no longer hold my tongue, and my need to share would overpower my desire to remain silent. La Condesa GTS created just that situation.   I entered this space wound tighter than a spring ready to pop. Surely there could be no way that it could meet the lofty expectations set forth by my fellow yelper's reviews. But there is something very pure about this place, and as I stepped through the over-sized wood door, I knew this southwest girl was home.   The best way I can describe the atmosphere is Southwestern Minimalist. Monique H was dead on with her praises for the artwork - The Blue Demon (long live Alejandro Munoz Moreno) proudly intermingles with Diego and Frida and the acid treated floors feel natural. I also liked that this is clearly a community effort, with the art work provided by two exceptional Mexican artists (Manuel Gilavalos y Garcia and Ricardo Ramirez) and the furniture/decor provided by Bellas Artes de Mexico. I love that there is already a partnership, holding this little gem up until it can take flight.   The food is clean. The flavors crisp. The portions more than adequate, and the prices less than I would expect to pay for such quality. Most selections can come in the form of a taco, a quesadilla, or a burro, although there are one or two additional options under both the quesadilla and burro menus. Each flavor combination is clearly described and in a handful of situations, there are salsa suggestions outlined on the out of this world salsa bar. The best way I can describe this is to think of a wine pairing with a food that will make flavors pop... in other words, just try it because the sum of the parts is way better than the individual components!   The Mayan Conchita Pibil and the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken are two of the finest examples I've had of either. Both are mouth wateringly moist and fairly melt. I would suggest the Peanut or Mexican salsa as additional choices for the MCP for the spicy recommended habanera. The guacamole and cilantro salsas were both mild choices and if the mole were not already a mouthful of perfection, might be the additional layer of flavors that bring you to the tipping point. Personally, I found the pickled onions severed atop with some of the Jicama salsa, tossed in for a little crunch, just enough to make my eyes roll back in to my head. I mean seriously, if I could wiggle around naked in this stuff, it would be a really good night! The Aztec Tinga is deceptively simple. Your first bite may seem relatively ordinary, but then start the countdown. Within a few seconds, the flavors hit you like a wall of emotion. Your lips and tongue begin to tingle with the heat of the perfectly balanced peppers. My BIL has tried the Sonoran Carne Asada and was unusually quiet as he made his way through his plate, so I have to assume that was good as well. Finish things up with those out of the world beans, or some of the grilled Mexican Calabacitas and a meal just can't get much better.   So much has already been said about the iconic salsa bar, there really isn't much I can add, except to say, try them all! You will find two or three that send you to your happy place.   The staff was super friendly and more than ready to answer questions or make suggestions. It's an order at the counter and take-a-number kind of place, but you can generally expect several service passes through the dining room.   My only cautions / suggestions would be to grab a takeout menu so you don't have to stand and look at the wall menu with your mouth gaping like a cod fish and be prepared to park along Palm if the street inset parking area is full.   This is my new love. I will definitely be adding this in to the regular rotation. At a dinner plate with drink running you between 8 and 9 dollars (with enough food to make two decent sized meals) this is one indulgence I can fit in to my life with little or no rationalizing. Please take the time to check this place out and support yet another wonderful family owned business. Look around when you come in, because I may be joining Joel L on one of his weekly visits. : )",

    "text": "So I finally got off my yelpn butt and made it on over to La Condesa for lunch today. I got there around 1045, so I was that creepy taco stalker in the parking lot for about 15 minutes. I ordered teh La Condesa Shrmip Burro and the Oaxacan Mole chicken Taco. As I waited, I was able to check out the 8 or 9 different salsas they had there. Great stuff, I only packed up four. My fave, by a mile, was the creamy cilantro salsa. I wanna bathe in that stuff, like now. My food was ready pretty quick and I was in and out, which is nice.The taco was great, I really liked the flavor in the mole. I decided to add some of the peanut salsa the had, which was pretty good. I do have to say the Burro did fall a bit flat for me. there were tons of ingredients in tehre, but somehow it seemed to be a bit bland without adding any of the salsas to it.  Kiinda like that girl you see at the club, and y ou get home and...well, you get the picture. It was a good burro, but the shrimp were somehow flavorless and the bacon was non-existent. Not that I'm total food snob but when you tell me there's bacon in that mug, I wanna taste me some bacon. Overall my meal was good, I'm going to go back another day and try some other things on the menu, like the dogfish taco. Two thumbs up for the creativity on the food and the salsas, it's hard to stand out in teh Phoenix Taco/Burro scene.",

I'm working my way down the menu, but at this point my favorite tacos are the cochinita pibil (so very, very flavorful), the Oaxacan black mole, and the gaucho (or whatever they call it --- it's the steak taco with the Argentine flavors).

    "text": "I had high expectations for La Condesa, but it quickly turned to La Confusion. The three of us went in during the week for a late lunch, salivating at the thought of some tasty tacos. We each ordered a different  taco combo plate, one Aztec Tinga, one Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken,  one Baja Sur Dogfish Shark, and a quesadilla.  After waiting a significant amount of time, the waitress brought out our quesadilla and one combo plate with one Aztec Tinga taco and one Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken taco. Despite going over our order numerous times with our server and another gentlemen, somehow, what we wanted seemed beyond comprehension. They brought out the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark taco combo plate and, after waiting so long and confusion over our order, we gave up and ate what we had. The Azteca Tinga was superb. The Oaxaca Black Mole was good. The Baja Sur Dogfish wasn't really any better than your average fish taco. The rice is a white rice that had decent flavor and the same can be said for the flavor of the refried beans. La Condesa has a great salsa bar, a cozy interior decorated with some great Dia de los Muertos art. The staff was nice and friendly, despite the fact our order remained so elusive. But, after the ordeal with our order and the less than stellar meal, I have to say that La Condesa was an utter disappointment.",

    "text": "I met a friend here for lunch and it was both of our first times. When I arrived, I parked next door at a mexican party shop. I am not sure if I was supposed to park there or not. Luckily I didn't get towed. Parking is not so fantastic there and you have to drive slowly down the street so you don't miss it. The restaurant is in a non-descriptive block.  When I walked in, I loved the big wood chairs and tables. The feel was authentic mexican inside. We grew up going to Mexico every family vacation and my parents always liked to go to the non-touristy spots, especially in Cancun downtown. This restaurant reminded me of the Yucatan-inspired restaurant we visited that was right next to the bull fighting arena. So did some of the items on the menu. There was a mini bar for the salsas, and I think they had about 6 out. I wish they put a name card out for them so you knew what they were. I decided to grab a few different ones and see which I liked best. None of them were outstanding, but I did enjoy the unique, but hot strawberry salsa. I  decided to try a corn quesadilla off the menu, looking forward to real mexican queso in my meal. I ordered the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Quesa. It had Oaxaca cheese, roasted pork shoulder with achiote rojo and Mexican herbs. It was delicious, though, it was so filling, I could only eat half.  I was unhappy about the tortilla chips.  They tasted old and stale. I figured they'd be fresh and hot from the fryer since I got there right when they opened.  I need to go back again so I can really get a feel for more of the food and atmosphere. I think this is a review-in progress situation...",

I think they were some of the worst chips I have ever had, I had one.. I requested another basket and they kindly bought another basket of chips but they were the same, Stale, hard and dull. I ordered the Aztec Tinga Taco, and they were very good. The salsa's were all great.

We were told there was a thirty minutes wait originally, but noticed two spots at the bar open. So we asked if we can sit there and she said let me ask. After walking around for ten minutes, not talking with anyone and seeing that we didn't leave she wiped the bar down and we sat. We got our chips and we grabbed our own salsa. After ten minutes we got water. And that's it. No one offered to take our drink order or food order. A single man sat next to us after us, and a four top behind us. The four top was the last to be seated. Got their order taken first. Then the single man. Never us. They looked at us and it's a tiny restaurant so they saw us. The woman seemed like she didn't want us to eat there because they had a bad rush. Well don't worry we won't come back again. And all the placards for their awards were for another taco shop.",

    "text": "Chicken tinga burros and grilled zucchini, oh my!  So I've been here a few times and figured it was about time to give it a review.  It's easy to pass by this as it's squeezed in between a closed down car repair shop and a Mexican party shop, complete with pinatas hanging outside.  The only giveaway is the fact that however nice your ride is, there's at least two other vehicles here way classier parked beside you.  You open a large wooden door to a cacaphony of fantastic smells, dizzied by this olfactory blast and pupils adjusting to the darkened lighting, and stumble to find an open table to sit down at.  The furniture is all heavy wood an iron, a signifier of the quality of the place, but the placing is not the best, leading to endless bumping and apologies, the only thing that could be considered a bad point to this place.  If you love salsa, this place hosts a bar with at least ten different types of salsa including ones made from ground pecans, which became addicting after the initial shock of eating salsa made from nuts.  It's hard to find for those coming with quite an appetite I recommend the Santos Plate.  It's a choice of one taco, one burrito and a generous helping of grilled zucchini.    I tend to slather anything I get in salsa to raise the spice level, the chicken tinga in a burrito does not require it at all, by the end of this huge burrito I was starting to feel sweat droplets forming but I couldn't pull away from how delicious it was.  The taco choice recommendation is the pork shoulder cooked in banana leaves, the flavor was amazing and the red vinegared topping added just the perfect amount of sweet and sour.  I'm not a big fan of chocolate but if you are, the mole taco will definitely hit those key notes with you as well.  I've never personally ordered the horchata but one of my co-workers did.  It only comes in one size, LARGE.  Be very thirsty and take your insulin beforehand.  Thirty-two ounces awaits of what was originally horchata, now spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg, ground pecans and strawberry.  Definitely not your average rice drink.  Overall you can't go wrong here, everything is made fresh, hot and delicious.  This place has become a monthly ritual spot, it should be for you as well.",

I'm a fan of Horchata in general, but I have to say La Condesa has the best I've ever had. Also, they managed to change my opinion about Mole with their Mole Chicken taco.   The salsa bar has no equal! Cilantro Salsa, Jicama Salsa, Peanut Salsa, the list goes on an on. You can experience what seems like enless and amazing combinations of flavors.  I'm definitely going back!",

Unfortunately, the vegetarian Quesa was basically a pocket of air and tasted like it was fried in something that fries fish.The place is being run without strategy or organization; staff wanders around aimlessly without purpose, empty tables everywhere, bussed and not, and the bar was full of dirty dishes so no where to sit on CINCO DE MAYO on a Friday night. Meanwhile, patrons were left to wait for up to 45 minutes while the incompetence continued. The manager (ponytail) has no clue what he's doing, seemed to make his staff uncomfortable, and makes customers uncomfortable. The guy is really unprofessional and we couldn't wait to leave.  Not going to return here until changes are made. Also to the manager: stop touching the arm of your waitresses, it's creepy. -Former waitress of 4 years.",

    "text": "Mexican style food in Phoenix is both varied and plentiful, so any restaurant that can lure me in to being a regular is doing something right.   La Condesa is a hip little taco shop on 16th street, close enough for me to walk to. The decor is a trendy/traditional mash up that works well. Honestly, the food is good enough that I'd probably buy it from a guy in an alley.   I've sampled several different varieties of meat based products as well as the beans. Everything has been well prepared and fresh. The Mayan Cochinita Pibil in particular is drool-worthy. It's mildly sweet and super tender. Adding a little of the chipotle salsa really sets it off.   Ah, the salsa. There are some truly interesting varieties, from tamarind to pecan. The pecan salsa was a great surprise, with a nice amount of heat. It really sits well with the carne asada.   My only negative comment involves the parking situation. The parking lot is situated in such a way that in order to leave you have to back out onto 16th street. If a big ass SUV with tinted windows happens to park next to you (which always seems to happen) then pulling out can be...invigorating.   La Condesa now has a well earned spot of honor in my restaurant rotation.",

However, when venturing out with my nonalcoholic parents this weekend, I consulted Yelp for some good Mexican food, subscribing to my parents theory that the most authentic Mexican food is in a hole in the wall joint in a scary part of town.  Well, La Condesa is not in an area where I would take an after dark stroll, but it is by no means a hole in the wall!  The restaurant is small, clean, well decorated and most importantly they have a salsa bar filled with amazing salsas, made fresh daily to suit all taste preferences.    My parents and I had various burritos and the bill was under $20 for the 3 of us.  Mom still hauled away quite the selection of \"to go\" sauces and the waitress was very polite and didn't even call her cheap (which I of course made sure to do)!  To make the evening even more exciting, I accidentally spilled my water on the floor and knocked a painting off the wall when I stood up to leave.   I will return to this restaurant not only because i feel guilty that the restaurant lost revenue by us dining there, both through extra takeout and damage, but the food was also excellent!",

All in all, its kind of uncomfortable service/restaurant wise (self serve) but the tacos are very good and you do get chips and a variety of salsas.

    "text": "Visited here today for lunch for the first time. I was pretty excited about a salsa bar since I've never been to one and my last meal would definitely include chips and salsa. The rave reviews on Yelp won me over so I decided to recommend this place to a friend so we could meet up for lunch.  Luckily I snagged a spot right out front at 1pm but I'm not sure where the additional parking was? Upon entering, the place has some cute decor but it was a little startling to walk in and see that it's pretty small inside and it was busy. With no hostest stand, I immediately had that, 'deer in headlights look' about what to do and where to go but I was recognized when I walked in within a few seconds and luckily there was a table for two open. While I was recognized and that was a relief, I wasn't greeted per say but was just asked if there would only be one for lunch. I said I was waiting for a friend so luckily they sat me without her being there. The water came around and gave me small plastic Solo cup full for water and menus. I've never seen solo cups like this in a restaurant? Maybe it's for the lunch crowd? I noticed all the other tables had larger drinks, also in plastic cups, so maybe it was just for your drinks to go?  Anyway, my friend arrived a few minutes later and after we got caught up on our week and looked over the menu, I had to flag down our waiter to order. I attempted to order the grapefruit margarita that I had heard rave reviews about but the waiter didn't understand 'Grapefruit Margarita' and offered some fruity one with melon and something else. When I confirmed that it didn't have grapefruit and he offered another one, again without grapefruit, I opted just to forget it and drink the water. I figured I would fill up on chips and salsa so I went with two al la cart tacos. My friend ordered a mahi mahi bowl. I was pretty impressed with their chips, not overly thick like some places and pretty light and the the 6-7 salsas we tried were mostly good. I wasn't aware there was a need for peanut salsa? It was definitely different but not something I needed to try twice. My favorites were the creamy white one (can't remember the name) and the strawberry salsa one. You go help yourself to the salsa bar once they bring the chips but it looked like you had to pay extra for an extra bowl of chips since they were on their special of the day board for $2. Also, the salsa bar had small dipping cups to eat the salsa. They're about the size of the to-go dressing cups you get in other restaurants but not quite as deep. Again, they were plastic so it kinda took away from the overall feel of the meal. I'm all for convenience and I know this probably cuts down on the customers filling up larger containers and wasting salsa...and doing dishes...but I would think there has to be a more environmentally and more aesthetic way to do this? Granted, this is no fancy Mexican place but they seemed to put effort in the decor so maybe that's where they spent all their money on rather than real dishes? It definitely did discourage me from going back for seconds though so maybe that was their goal?  Our food came and both my tacos were really good. The presentation was nice, no plastic there! The tortillas were fresh and all ingredients seemed quality. My friend said her dish was really good and she got a really big portion.   We enjoyed our meal but our waiter never returned. A young kid, maybe 8 or 10, came over and asked to take our plates and he asked if there was anything else we needed. I requested the bill thinking he would tell our waiter that we were ready for the check. I'm guessing this is a family owned place so I understand everyone pitching in but the kid then delivered our check and then took our credit cards to pay for the bill! Our waiter was standing back at the register, almost watching over him though, but I still wasn't overly eager about handing over my card to such a young kid. He was at least faster than our waiter though so I guess it was okay.  I really don't mean to harp on this place because the food was good. Just a few more things done differently and I could see this being a go-to spot for me. For now, it doesn't top my list of places I have to come back to soon.",

So my mind was way bigger than my tummy but here is what I ordered:  1. Aztec Tinga Taco- Spicy yummy and honestly one of my favorite Mexican dishes so this was one of my top fav's  2. Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco- This is how I found this place and it was a good taco but didn't stand with my other tacos in taste.  3. Arrachera steak Taco-  This was the first I ate and it was awesome the steak was nice and charred and the flavor was just killer.  4. Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Taco-  Woooooow this one was awesome packed full of flavor and was very moist.  This was another one of my fav's.  5. Gaucho Taco-  This was my total favorite.  It was a carne asada steak taco with avocado and Argentinian Chimicurri sauce on it.  Oh man sooooo yummy I am drooling just thinking about it right now.    Last I had the Horchata which had a interesting twist with fresh fruit and pecans in it.  Honestly it was one of the best Horchata's I've ever had.    On top of all this they have an AMAZING salsa bar with about 15 different salsas for all palates.    If you've never gone take my advice and go and thank me later.  I can't wait to go back probably won't make it past tomorrow.  :)",

Around 20 salsas with a variety of flavors and ingredients, from a pecan salsa, to old standbys like pico de gallo. I would highly recommend this restaurant to ANYONE, and have brought folks visiting from out of town. Everyone agrees, this is the best of the best.  P.S. The place is definitely cozy.

Enough salsa verde on top got the job done.  $2 negra modelo on Sunday was a bonus.  Certainly worth eating. Especially for $10.",

    "text": "Came in at around 4PM on a Saturday, parking was terrible but we assumed it had to be good since the parking lot was packed. Walked in and the whole front room was packed with patrons so we waited patiently to be seated. The artwork was phenomenal and the full bar was inviting, but after five minutes of not being acknowledged in any way, we were starting to lose patience. Finally we were seated in the back room, which is much larger and at the time nearly empty except for two groups of 5 people.  We both ordered three tacos each, which were way pricier than we were expecting, they range between 3.99 and 5.50 each or you can do a mix and match plate. Many of their options are seafood so that limited us a bit since we aren't fans, though if you like seafood maybe you'll have better luck than we did!  The salsa bar is extensive so we were excited, we loaded up 12 mini condiment cups, filling them with everything from clearly pico to some more mysterious salsas. Tried out a few on the chips as we waited for our food and found that none of them were spicy in any way, the best was the Pico and another similar to it.   Finally our tacos arrived and we dug in. Well we tried to. Instead we each ate about half of each taco (except for the barbiccoa which both of us got, I ate both of them after he discovered he hated it). Each taco ranged from bad to almost inedible. Each taco was miniscule, barely the size of my hand and barely filled except for the lack luster and down right gross tasting garnish. The meat quality on the other habd was great, tasteless but great quality so there was room for it to be delicious, they just failed that goal. In the end the only tacos I could suggest were the barbiccoa, which I found good enough to even crave again but for the price and how lacking everything else was, I can guarantee we will not be returning.  I would suggest this place to anyone with family or friends who like a great setting and casual drinks with some small bites, especially if they're not generally fans of Mexican food. The place is inviting and interesting with plenty of tasteless options to explore.",

I know most of us look only at the tacos and ignore everything else on the menu. Big mistake!! My friend decided to order the al pastor quesa while I decided to stick to tacos. Their vegetarian taco section caught my eye and I ordered the cauliflower al pastor. I also ordered their potato and chorizo taco which I absolutely love.   Their extensive salsa bar is always a delight. Although, most of their sauces tend to skew spicy. It works for me, so no complaints there. Our food arrived and the chorizo taco was phenomenal, as I expected. But the real winner that evening was the quesa. Bless the lord! This is one of the best things I have ever tasted at a Mexican restaurant. The meat was incredibly flavorful with an opulence of cheese (again, not complaining). The crust itself was beautifully flaky and crisp. I have had dreams about this quesa after that evening. If you ever visit this restaurant, consider skipping the tacos (which are actually pretty great) and order the quesa. You will not regret it. I feel I should quickly mention the cauliflower \"al pastor\". This was one the saddest things of the evening. Huge chunks of barely cooked cauliflower thrown on a taco with some sauce. Meh! The quesa, however, outdid all my expectations. So I'm still giving this 5 stars. I will absolutely return!",

    "text": "I VERY rarely give 5 stars flat out...but the Torta that I had today for lunch blew my mind, so I had to give 5 stars. Honestly this place is amazing and I'm already craving more.  I ordered the Mayan cochinita pibil Torta (which they call something else) it came with just pickled red onions on top and rice and beans on the side. I was initially worried that I would be too dry or boring because it was so plain, but one bite and I was hooked. That slow roasted pork was to die for. I basically inhaled the entire sandwich.  My family also ordered some tacos and those were incredible as well. The only thing that was a little disappointing was the beans, they were just a little too watery for my taste but they were still good.   Highly recommend for satisfying cravable Mexican food fix.",

Only 3 tables occupied, had to wait for service for at least 5 minutes and of course, when dining alone, 5 min seems like 10.   I ordered the 3 street taco plate with chicken asado, al pastor and the Mexico City Taco (can't remember the name).  They were tasty, but truly uneventful.  Ive had better flavor from a roach coach and I am a street taco lover!!!  The chips were good and the salsa bar had a wide range of salsas to choose from and all were delicious and tried 6 of them.  On a side note, the chair was old and ripped my pants!!!  Oh well, shit happens.  All in all, it was good, not great.  I would have hoped for more timely, enthusiastic greeting.  I rate it as \"average\"",

I usually get the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Tacos, but I also like the  Cabo Shrimp Tacos.  My boyfriend prefers beef, pork, and chicken dishes.

Busy time means no chips unless you ask for it. One of the bartenders, who I think was the owner was, running around opening doors and wiping the sweat off his head and still had time to make a margarita without washing his hands and grabbing the straw right from where the guest was going to put his lips on. Good thing it wasn't my margarita... While I'm waiting I go to the restroom which was poorly cleaned. Pee... everywhere which again the person before me could of been the one to do it but get this... no hand soap. I hope the employees were washing their hands after using the restroom. So, finally get my food which looks good until I look at the basket which was holding the food and see there is dried gunk from whoever used it before me. Beans. Rice. Salsa. It was all dried on there. I took my wrapper out of the basket and set it aside. Already grossed out by the dirtiness I decided I was never coming back. As soon as I got home after my 20 minute drive I immediately began feeling sick... I wonder why. I really don't even wanna think how much germs I came in contact with.",

It had a spoonful of sweetened strawberries in the bottom and loads of cinnamon on the top. Yum!  The chips were basic, but the salsa bar was a great surprise with some very unusual offerings (e.g. a creamy cilantro salsa, a pecan salsa, a jicama salsa). The burro was loaded w rice and chicken mole. The mole sauce was rich and complex, but I wish there had been more in the burro. As a final note, at lunch, you order at the counter and the line can be slow. So don't find a table and peruse the menu (like I did) or you might look up and find that the short line is now VERY long!!",

Street tacos were great (chicken was super tender and could be cut with a fork) and the mole had the right combination of smoky and chocolately taste. Salsa bar is also one of the best I've ever seen - my personal favorite is the pecan salsa. The cilantro salsa is a close second, which is funny because I normally HATE the taste of fresh cilantro. I've also ordered the El Gaucho queso, which is basically like a big Mexican calzone. Steak was prepared well and tender and the outside shell was perfectly crisp on the outside.   As good as the food is, I have to say the horchata was my favorite item. It's a little different from your normal horchata as it contains walnuts, strawberries, and a healthy dollop of cinnamon on top. It seemed strange at first, but it works!!   Prices were very reasonable too (4 street tacos, steak queso, and a horchata all for $24). The restaurant is small and unassuming, and is the kind of place you would easily miss if you weren't looking for it. Also, it's pretty small and cramped in there, but when the food and drinks are this good, who's noticing that? Sure, this place may not be the most authentic Mexican restaurant (mostly gringoes up in here) but it is still one of my favorite restaurants in the area since moving to Arizona two months ago!",

    "text": "I had an extremely hard time deciding whether to rate this restaurant three or four stars. It is a solid 3.5 stars, but I decided to raise it due to the free salsa bar and authentic food.  The restaurant is a small location with an all-you can eat salsa bar with various flavours such as cilantro salsa, peanut salsa, tomatillo salsa, and strawberry salsa just to name a few from the selection. The meal also came with a free bowl of tortilla chips, but extra bowls cost more. The tortilla chips were a little thin for me, but definitely tasted authentic.  I ordered the taco plate with two different tacos. When ordering it was a bit difficult to understand what the waiter was saying, but contrary to the menu, he said that you can have two different tacos on the menu instead of one type on the taco plate for $8.99. In the end I paid more than the $8.99 for my taco plate in the end.  I got to taste three different tacos and a part of a burrito after sharing with some other people eating with me. My wild white fish taco was extremely crunchy, but disappointing due to the fish ultimately being too big for the corn wraps. The traditional Mexican taco was very spicy, and the meat was fairly flavourful. The best taco was the pork shoulder taco which was moist and tasted great. I also tried all of the tacos with the spicy guacamole provided at the salsa bar for an added kick. The pork burrito used a flour tortilla and was relatively bland aside from the pineapple salsa which was a refreshing sweet flavour.  Overall it was a nice portion, but was a little expensive. The food is definitely authentic and provided a delicious taco.",

    "text": "Tip: When it says 3.99 a la carte, it's actually only 1 taco. Only the taco plate has 2 tacos. We made that mistake and our bill ended up tripling in price.   On a brighter note, the horchata was fantastic! This is the first time I've seen horchata filled with so much fruit and it was such a large size, perfect for sharing. We ordered the slow cooked pork taco and I thought it was a little too messy. I enjoyed the fish tacos the most, light and crispy.  Also loved the extensive salsa bar and the fact there is cilantro salsa!",

    "text": "Fond memories here at La Santisima. Every single time I come here for their La Santisima veggie taco plate, it feels like a great life decision. These tacos are heavenly with fresh sauteed mushrooms, spinach, zucchini and onions with melted cheese. Then there is the salsa bar with around a dozen house made salsas. They best is the Mexican salsa and the pecan salsa crema. Oh and can't forget about their massive horchata drink they serve with chopped nuts and fruit on top. For those who partake, they have a bar with several tequilas, and probably other things. Small place, but cozy and intimate. Good spot for a casual date night where you can be a cool Phoenician that knows of the perfect spot for dinner. Parking is on 16th street, kind of a weird diagonal situation where you hope you don't get side swiped by traffic... But hey. Totally worth it if you do. These tacos. Yum.",

Orders were taken at the cashier, then sat down with a number. The menu was a little confusing with all these caveats and pricing schemes, but at the end of the day, we got some tacos and we liked them.  *** FOOD *** They allow you to create \"meals\", so we got two - one with 2 gourmet tacos and another 3 street tacos.   Cochinita Pibil Street Taco (5/5) Mouthwatering and delicious. Pork was super juicy and well worth it. You'll see this in many other reviews and there's a reason for that.   Al Pastor Street Taco (2/5) I have a habit of always trying my favorite meat everywhere even if the reviews suggest otherwise. Wasn't really a fan, flavor was a bit lacking.   Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Gourmet Taco (4/5)  Cabo Shrimp Gourmet Taco (4/5)  *** DRINK *** I have two categories of Mexican places. Places that serve horchatas and places that don't. (The latter contends with Taco Bell.) However, living on the east coast most of my life, I haven't seen anything other than a normal horchata... I had a pleasant surprise here.  Fruit & Pecan Horchata (5/5)  Topped with strawberries, pecans, and a healthy dose of cinnamon, this had enough body (i.e., not watered down) to take on the sweetness delivered by the fruit and still taste like an horchata. It was novel and delicious. Highly recommended.  *** BOTTOM LINE *** Check it out. It's worth it. Get an horchata. And one to go.",

We split the House Margarita. We had asked for no salt but it still came salted. It was good,  although I don't like salt on my margarita when I am trying one for the first time because I want to know what it tastes like without anything added.  I got a lot of food (because I couldnt decide what to get). I got the traditional Quesadilla which is ironically not a traditional quesadilla. It is a corn tortilla  folded over that has Oaxaca Cheese inside and its fried. Its kinda like a Calzone but better. If I had to pick a cheese that could possibly be my favorite cheese in Mexican cuisine it would be Oaxaca. The Quesadilla was amazing but it is HUGE. I was expecting something around the size of my hand.  Nope, one half was probably the size of my hand. We did ask for no crema but they still put it on there. I also got the Conchita Lonche, the meat was delicious but the bread was kinda hard. It does come with mustard, which I was not expecting. It would be a great thing to order for Lunch for anyone who works downtown (which I do).  My boyfriend got the shark taco but I was not up for trying it mainly because I barely eat fish tacos when it is cod inside. It did look good displayed on his plate. I didn't get to try the beans but the rice was good. I have a hard time judging rice because I still believe my Nana makes the best white rice.   The service wasn't bad but the woman was the only one really taking care of tables and about 4 tables including us walked in probably within 5 mins. So she was running around taking orders, running food and then touching back to the tables to see if anything was alright.    In the end, I definitely am coming back.",

I ordered the guacho burrito and the horchata due to the yelpster's recommendations. I usually don't go for beef so I wasn't crazy about the burrito, but it was good.   I was freaking crazy about the Horchata though!  I am a salsa snob so it takes a lot to impress me.   Rule number one - it must cause burn or don't call it salsa.   The seven chiles was so good that there wasn't much left at the salsa bar.   What was left, I took!  Second best salsa was the salsa peanut!  It was creamy, hot, flavorful and the best salsa peanut I have ever had!  So happy that they serve real salsas. My only recommendation for them would be to improve on the chips.   The chips are a bit thin, but cover them with salsa and all will be alright. When in Phoenix-go to this place.   It's a bit small, but hang in there and grab a seat and set your tongue on fire then cool it down with the horchata!",

Help yourself to the wide variety (about 20) of salsas @ the salsa bar and your server will come take your order. I got the cochinita pibil tacos and my husbannd got the carne asada tacos...we got the combo plates with rice and beans, 2 tacos for $6.99. I don't know where that person has been eating who said this was expensive...the plates (baskets) come looking a little plain, but you have all those salsas to add to your tacos which makes it fun and filling! Rice and beans quantity was a little small for my husband, but just right for me. The carne asada tacos were good, but the cochinta pibil were amazing! I love the artwork and the tables and chairs...it's a great place! Plastic cutlery is a turn off, but who cares when the food is so good. I like La Condesa more than America's! *ducking behind the sofa*",

Then instead of her giving us our money back, dhe made us stand in the long line again and didnt even apologize. WOW... unbelievable.

Classic taste and the refried beans are not cooked in lard, which is nice for vegetarians to know and whatever oils they use give them a good savory taste. No bland beans here! If dairy is not your thing, the Ghandi Vegan burrito has fresh guacamole and black beans matched by no other. And if the entrees weren't enough, there is also THE best salsa bar of all time. The red chipotle salsa must have some sort of addictive substance in it, as I cannot stop at just two servings.  The service is top notch and the atmosphere is mellow.  My only issue is that it's kinda hard to see from the road. But you can see the sign pretty easy if you're looking for it.",

    "text": "What took me so long to get to La Santisima?  Not much to add to the myriad of great reviews about this place other than to say Yelpers are dead on with this one.  The food, drinks, atmosphere, and staff all make this place a valley favorite for good reason.  Tonight my brother and his wife took me here as a late birthday present.  They've been here dozens of times and love it.  So I was confident what I was about to get would be pretty money.  And it was.  Let me first confirm what so many are saying about a specific drink here.  The Horchata.  Yes, its enormous and yes its awesome.  Has a nice light texture with accents of cinnamon and nuts.  The salsa bar here is also as extensive as advertised.  My brother and sister grabbed cups of each and every salsa for me to try (which was hilarious to watch since they were carrying full handfuls of salsa cups).  My favorite salsas were probably their cilantro and tomatillo.  As for the main course, its a taco shop first and foremost so I went the taco route.  The two that Yelp suggested most were the Mayan Cochinita and Cabo Shrimp.  Outstanding choices.  The cochinita pork was out of this world tender and delicious.  And the cabo shrimp was delicious and the portion on the taco was VERY generous (I could barely hold it on the tortilla).  The other thing that stood out to me was the rice on the side.  Seriously.  This isn't your run of the mill rice.  It's got a creamy savory thing going on.  Not sure exactly what they put in there (though I did pick up on some corn notes), but that rice is good stuff.  We didn't do dessert this time, but I'm sure I'll give that a try next time I'm here.  The service we received was super friendly and on point.  The place is small with seating for no more than 20 and it was pretty busy on a Saturday night.  So on most nights you might have to wait just a bit for a table.  Parking here is also pretty scarce so keep that in mind.  Its quintessentially traditional and delivers a wonderfully tasty experience.  I'll be back regularly and that horchata will likely accompany each of those visits.",

    "text": "I hate it when I don't love a place that everyone else loves, but after seeing the reviews and ratings for La Santisima, I expected a lot. I wish my expectations had been met!  This is definitely hard to find, but we were able to park in one of the few spots up front. The parking lot is small, and you might have to park a few blocks away in the nearby neighborhood. If you have a big car, you should probably skip looking for a spot right in front and just park in the neighborhood to save yourself some grief.  The restaurant is small and cramped. Seating is very close, and even during early times, there is a wait. If you don't mind high impact, you'll probably be fine with La Santisima. Service is very slow - there's only a couple people working in the restaurant serving as host/hostess, server, and from what I could tell, bartender. I have to give credit because obviously the two servers were running around like crazy, busting their butts and doing the best they could, but I really think it would be good to hire another person so that you don't have to wait to be seated, wait to receive a menu, wait to receive water, wait to order a drink, wait to order food, wait to receive food, etc. In short - things might be sped up (quite a bit?) if another person worked there.  Salsa bar is nice, but I think bigger cups should be available in addition to the small ones because it's annoying to get up 93874 times for refills. I did love the peanut salsa - spicy and delish. House margaritas are nice, and strong! Quesadillas are delicious and wonderful as an appetizer. I would get them again as a meal.  Tacos... hm. El gaucho tacos had very chewy meat, with little seasoning... bland. Pork tacos are pretty good, but but not wow. Just... hm. Much to be desired. Beans are too salty, but the rice is very good. I don't know. I just expected more flavor and better quality meat.  In sum! Not bad, just OK.",

    "text": "Life is all about creating a balance. This idea translates to a restaurant with its elements of food, service and decor.  The gourmet taco shop La Condesa is still trying to find its own equilibrium, but the line of customers nearly out the door isn't giving the new establishment much of a chance.  La Condesa is located on 16th Street, just north of McDowell, in a neighborhood that's no stranger to tasty Mexican food, including Tortas El Guero and the popular Barrio Cafe.  With no shortage of good Mexican food, how does a new place stand out? They do things their own way.  You'll notice striking artwork on the walls. The art is beautifully lit, and from a visual standpoint it's hard to look away, that's until you see the salsa bar.  Once you place your order at the counter, you're given a number. Then have a seat and a staffer will deliver a basket of crunchy chips. This is when the fun begins, tapping that salsa bar.  On each of my visits, the salsa line up was never quite the same, with at least six to choose from. Standouts include an Avocado Salsa that was vibrant and flavorful, the chunky salsa Mexicano and the Creamy Cilantro Salsa.  If you run out of chips they will refill your basket, but try not to fill up on chips while you wait for your food, because you will indeed wait, and wait, and wait... On each of my visits the kitchen took from 15 to 45 minutes to deliver my order. But don't let this discourage you because some things are worth waiting for.  The tacos are served on two 6-inch corn tortillas. You can order tacos ala carte ($2.99 each) or as a two taco plate ($6.99) with rice and beans.  The beer battered Cabo Shrimp version was hot and fresh, yet perfectly crunchy while leaving the shrimp moist and tender. The Sonoran Carne Asada had a great flavor but was more like jerky, tough and dry.  Burritos were mostly a miss, while paying a premium ($7.29). You can choose shrimp or mahi mahi. Mine were filled with too much rice and not enough seafood.  However the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Burro ($6.99) was an absolute killer. Filled with luscious roasted pork shoulder, it was so tender you don't need teeth to eat it.  The handmade Corn-Quesa is going to bring me back. They take fluffy corn masa and fold it around your selection of fillings, then use their deep frying to create a unique and substantial alternative to tacos and burritos.  Being a purist, the Traditional Quesa ($5.49) was one of my favorites, simply filled with gooey Oaxaca cheese.  The same Oaxaca cheese is paired with the earthy flavors of mushrooms in the Maria Sabina Quesa ($6.99).  For me, the thing to order is the Azteca Tinga Quesa ($7.29). Stuffed with shredded chicken, tomato, onion and chipotle sauce, the flavors were complex and each bite was sheer bliss.  Service is friendly and on some nights you might even see the owner's kids helping out.",

    "text": "Awesome salsa bar and SHARK tacos!! You rarely see the words \"gourmet\" and \"taco\" in the same sentence, but La Condesa somehow makes it work. However, La Condesa isn't in the best part of town, and I'm glad we came here for lunch versus dinner. We tried:  -Different Salsas from Salsa Bar (Pecan Salsa, Pico de Gallo, Mexican Salsa, Sesame Salsa, Cilantro Salsa, Grilled Peppers, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-condesa-gourmet-taco-shop-phoenix-2?select=ytgVAxv6hFuPzqsPxwQmhg#ytgVAxv6hFuPzqsPxwQmhg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/la-c...</a>): I liked the Pecan and Sesame salsas although I didn't get much pecan taste. The cilantro was too watery, but the grilled peppers were really good (and had a nice spicy kick). The pico de gallo was solid, as was the mexican salsa. Their tortilla chips are really good, and thin and crispy, so make sure you try them! -Tacos (From L to R: Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, Carnitas Street Taco, Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-condesa-gourmet-taco-shop-phoenix-2?select=ytgVAxv6hFuPzqsPxwQmhg#Wah_j9kHBXGf2NluqFZB_g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/la-c...</a>):  -Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco (Roasted Pork Shoulder w/Achiote Rojo, Wrapped in Banana Leaves, Slow-Cooked Until Fork Tender and Topped w/Lime Marinated Onions & Salsa Habanera Maya): I ordered this since a lot of other people seemed to like it, and it was a \"Yucatan specialty\". However, it was just ok. The pork was a little dry, and the flavors didn't stand out. I wouldn't order this again. -Carnitas Street Taco: Pretty good! The carnitas were very flavorful, and I liked how bite sized this taco was.  -Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco (Corn Tortilla Stuffed w/Beer Battered Dogfish Shark): DELICIOUS! I've had shark meat before and am used to it being tougher and firmer than regular fish. However, there wasn't a big different in the texture, but there seemed to be more of a sweetness to it. I guess I enjoyed the \"Baja Sur specialty\" vs. the Yucatan. This is a must order if you go to La Condesa!  I only saw a small strip of parking available in front of the restaurant, but it is shared with a convenience store. I think street parking was also available, but I'd recommend making sure you don't have any valuables out! I definitely plan on coming back to La Condesa and trying their other seafood tacos, but will make sure it's during lunch. Dining in is the way to go so that you can sample all of the different salsas. The staff was nice, but weren't the quickiest.",

We waited for 15-20 min for a server to greet us, which didn't happen. So finally, I walked up to the the bar area and informed the staff. One lady, who was probably the server in our area, said she'd be with us in just one sec! I went back to the table to wait with my friend. 5 min goes by and still no one came so we got up and left. What an absolute waste of time and no care in the world for their customers. Messing up an order is one thing and fairly understandable, but not a total lack of care and disrespect.",

We wanted to go back when we were flying back out of PHX, but we totally would have missed our flight and no tacos are worth that.

I came to dinner tonight and it took 15 minutes just to get water and chips. We finally were able to order and we both had the quesadilla with meat. We had to ask for napkins, silverware and more water. Our food was made wrong, didn't have what the menus said it did. There was tiny pieces of meat. Not sure I could even use the word tiny. There basically was no meat inside. It was over loaded with cheese. There was No flavor to it at all. We were never greeted on how everything was. So I never got a chance to change my order. I was just greeted with the check faster then the service in this place. I was extremely unhappy to pay for shitty service and bad food.",

When I walked in, there were 10 people in line - many \"couples\".   There was an open table for two at the front of the restaurant.  I approached the hostess (incompetent) about the table she said, \"we are not using the table\" followed by something about not wanting to overwhelm the wait staff.   Then, 5 minutes later she went back and talked to a waiter about the table.  She then proceeded to have a party sit down.  Really?  Overall experience:  I was there for over an hour just trying to get two tacos.   Food came out lukewarm probably because it was sitting in the kitchen waiting to come out.  Overall, service with waiter was pathetic.   The people here don't know what they are doing and should go to school to learn how to run a restaurant like a business.    My (Hispanic) friend always says, \"Mexican restaurants are not known for service\".  This restaurant epitomizes this statement.",

    "text": "I mean, it's whatever. At 1500 reviews, who cares at this point.   We're never in the area and decided to stop in for lunch this past Saturday afternoon. Bad choice. We were completely underwhelmed.  Pros:  Food. The salsas were great (our chips were stale though...), the tacos were outstanding. I had a chicken tinga taco (so juicy and topped with my favorite: picked red onion), a steak/veggie taco (topped with some sort of fried cheese...HELLO!) and a battered fish taco. I finished most of it, but I should have stopped way earlier. #fatpants  Cons:  Literally everything else. They were clearly understaffed (which by reading the reviews...is a trend? What?) and kept a wait, even though tons of tables were empty during our meal.   Bussing: We finished our chips and I piled the empty salsa ramekins, used napkins, etc. and pushed it to the side of our tiny table. You'd think our server would remove it when she set our plates down. Nope. WTF? I had to flag down a bus boy to put in his tub. Our table was so small and we needed the real estate to eat comfortably. When we were clearly done and asked for our check, she still didn't bother to pick up our plates and clear the table.  Wait: I get it. I worked in the service industry for way too long. I do understand. However, I've never been so close to walking out of a restaurant before. It took about 40 minutes for us to get our lunch. Our server walked by and told us \"Oh, your food is about to come out.\" That was the midway point, as we waited about 20 more minutes. Why would she just say that to us when it wasn't clearly ready? It felt like bizarro-world  The dining room was pretty grimy.  Truly, the food was amazing. But, we won't be back.",

    "text": "What more can you ask for from a legit Mexican restaurant? La Santisima has the tacos and salsa bar that make up Mexican food euphoria, and even offers serious vegetarian options.   My friend and I had dinner here. Driving from El Paso to Los Angeles, we had become sick of Chex Mix and energy drinks. I didn't realize La Santisima had been featured on Food Network's Triple D, but the Guy Fieri memorabilia gave it away immediately. In a fantastically awkward moment made possible by fourth generation cellular technology, we watched the restaurant's Food Network VODs right as the server came to take our order. The server let us finish watching.  There were more tacos available at the restaurant than its online menu currently displays. The veggie tacos I ordered were a classic guac, black bean, pico, and lettuce combination. They also offer a grilled zucchini type side for those that are looking to avoid eating rice. The food was fantastic. The freshness was palpable and the flavors were balanced. With so many salsas to choose from, I felt like a child in a candy store. Did I mix salsas? You bet I did. Maybe people should start saying, \"I felt like Chris at a salsa bar.\"  The restaurant had an odd atmosphere. Maybe it was the mermaid skeleton with dollar bills clipped to it. La Santisima wasn't quick - despite being an odd hour in the afternoon, our food took quite some time. They also charged for every basket of chips past basket numero uno. I'm sure the United Federation of Restaurants that Proudly Serve Chips and Salsa was furious at the first member restaurant to offer unlimited chips - that restaurant set a ridiculous expectation!  La Santisima was pretty tasty, and I would return for the salsas and tacos. I'm excited to see if Los Angeles has similar options.",

    "text": "First, the chips and salsa are great with the salsa bar and variety of flavors and heat.  That's where the good goes wrong...  There is something wrong in the restaurant plan: it took over 25 minutes, for example, for the check to be picked up after it was dropped off.  It took way too long for nearly every aspect of the dining experience: water, drinks, food, check.    We were in no rush, so contrary to some of the pushback on this nearly unanimous criticism, this isn't an entitlement issue.  This is a baseline comparison to other great local restaurants (such as El Comedor Guadalajara or Cocina 10 at Crescent) -- the service here is very poor.  I don't know if it's a structural problem, but it is indeed a problem.  The tables and chairs are too close together even for thin people, which makes it difficult for customers (and STAFF!) to maneuver in the expanded dining room.  This place has potential, but not until some of these baseline issues are addressed.",

It is hard to believe that with almost a Mexican restaurant on every corner in Phoenix that most if them if not all of them are disappointing or overpriced.  If you want a Scottsdale vibe with overpriced drinks and unauthentic food then this is not the place for you but if you want home flavor cooking with fresh ingredients with an authentic smile, then don't miss trying out this great new hot spot. You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "A great taco spot can be judged by the salsa. I pony up to the La Condesa salsa bar and prepare to judge. Today's salsa varieties included strawberry, cilantro, guac, and my fav a spicy salsa with tamatillios. Spicy, complex, AUTHENTIC, developed flavors exploded in my mouth as I sampled a rainbow of salsa with the chips that arrive before my tacos. Instantly, I could tell,  La Condesa Gourmet Taco Shop knows what they're doing in the kitchen, they care about quality, and are super fresh.    If Mexican food can be judged by salsa, a good Mexican restaurant can also be judged by the frijoles. These beans did not disappoint. Great flavor, perfect consistency, delicious salty cheese on top. MMMMM!   The Main Event: Tacos. Yay! Roasted Veggies: Awesome! Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco: WOAH! My lunch buddy declared: \"This is as good as my favorite taco stand in Mexico!\" (She lived there for 6 years!) How's that for authentic?! The Horchata may be the best in town. Definitely homemade, with strawberries, mmmmm. Not too sweet or watery. I can not wait to try the fried quesidillias.    With food this delicious, decor may not matter, however the inside is cozy & clean with heavy wooden tables and contemporary chicano art. I especially love the doors to the banos.   Prices are completely fair, cheaper than a combo at a chain restaurant. Meal for two with drinks was $20.  Taco Row is one reason i struggle with the thought of leaving the southwest. Salsa and tacos this phenomenal are difficult to recreate too far from the border. La Condesa, the new kid on the block, is worthy of praise & adoration.  i look forward to a long, delicious affair.",

    "text": "I almost feel useless writing this review, I think everyone has said it all.  But still, I liked it just that much that I want to have my say anyway!  I had one shrimp taco and one pibil taco.  The pibil was...... just... so, so so so good.  It made me want to exit through the kitchen and shoot the chef a la Johnny Depp (*i will not shoot any chefs, please do not report me).  The tortillas were just right, and I already want another one.  The shrimp taco.... I hate to say it but it WAS bland.  Not bad, just not very flavorful.  I poured on a bunch of the Cilantro Cream salsa, which didn't add much.  I'll stick with the pibil!  On to the salsas:  Believe the hype over this strawberry salsa.  Who the heck thinks these things up??  Regardless, it's brilliant and I hope they start selling it by the jar.  I was super excited about the cilantro cream, but it fell a little flat.  Like the shrimp tacos, it was good, just not filled with flavor.  The only other salsa I had was the plain old salsa, and it was really great as well.  And as for the horchata, I have never had horchata like that.  It really was delicious, but just so sweet and rich that I don't think I even finished 1/4 of it.  And for some reason, you can't get a smaller size.  But for a few sips after your meal, mmmmmmmmmm.  Dave B is right about the price.  BUT, we each got 2 tacos, and neither one of us finished them both.  I really think that splitting a 2 taco meal, combined with the DELICIOUS tortilla chips, is more than enough for 2 people.  As others have mentioned, the artwork is just stunning.  I love Day of the Dead art, and these were beautiful.    In short, the Yelpers are all right.  Just go, and thank us later.",

My Mexican buddy declared it some of the best meat he has ever eaten.

    "text": "Solid three and a half stars, rounded up because I am feeling magnanimous today . Others have already waxed rhapsodic about the high points of this little hidden gem: the decor (slightly kitschy, somewhat modern and a pinch of rustic), the salsa bar (over ten types, freshly made and flavorful without the tastebud massacre of straight hot chilis), and the horchata (yummy and light, made unique with the addition of finely chopped cantaloupe and strawberries and a sprinkle of pecans).   Being a quesadilla fanatic, I got the veggie one. Now, mind you, I had not read any reviews prior to my visit, so I was somewhat disconcerted  by the three pound Mexican calzone that arrived. I'm not complaining -- it was quite tasty -- but the puffy, doughy corn \"tortilla\" exterior was a bit much for me. Oh yeah, and the five handfuls of cheese inside of it. Too much. The damn thing was so big, it eventually became three meals.  My SO, the ultimate Mexican food snob, dug his chicken burro, although it was overstuffed and gooing and oozing everywhere, requiring him to attempt to consume it with a (cheap, flimsy plastic) knife and fork. Try cutting a hot, goopy mess wrapped in a tortilla sitting on a single thin piece of paper on a wicker basket with bendy cheap utensils. Yeah. Total mess. Not first-date friendly.  The location, parking, and service are questionable, as others have noted. We beat the rush by going late morning; I didn't think the wait for the food was unreasonable, but I wouldn't be stopping in here for a bite if I was in a hurry.  While I loved the horchata, the fruit was chopped just finely enough to go shooting up the straw unexpectedly. Total choking hazard for the less physically coordinated (read: me).   Overall, pretty, pretty good. We'll be back, although I'll pass on the quesadilla next time...",

Everything we've eaten had a distinct flavor so you can really get a feel for lots of different tastes. Whatever kind of \"Mexican\" you are in the mood for; this place will deliver. Nothing here ever feels like it was rushed to be cooked faster.  I have been here twice and the second time was even better than the first.  The first time we had 2 Cochinita pibil (pork) tacos, a Dogfish Shark taco and a Carne Asada taco. All of them were amazing with each having their own unique seasonings, complimentary accoutrement (pickled red onion for the pork, cabbage and creamy salsa for the shark etc.).  The second time we got a 'Dogfish Shark' taco, a chicken mole taco and a chicken burrito. The chicken mole was outstanding. My mouth is watering remembering it. It was a perfect earthy balance of the chili and the chocolate dancing on my tongue. The chicken burrito was also amazing in its simplicity. The refried beans are smoky and smooth in an indescribable way. The chicken was slow cooked and complimented the beans well.   The horchata was very good- and not gritty or powdery or too sweet like many places. My only complaint (because nothing's perfect right?) is I would have liked more ice. Yeah- that's all I could come up with.  The variety of salsas makes it fun. The first time we went they didn't have the strawberry salsa we had read so much about, so of course we had to come back! We got the strawberry salsa and there was also the peanut salsa which I preferred to the strawberry one. Again the variety of tastes in the salsa is fantastic. The flavor combinations are unique and widely varied from sweet, to savory to spicy.  I work around the corner so will definitely be back for more!",

The menu has some moments of brilliance but often lacks sensibility. Take the strawberry or peanut butter salsas. Nice try but not ready for primetime.  The corn Quesadillas are made with masa and rice flour to give the turnovers a nice crispy crunch and fantastic flavor. 5 stars for the taste! Loss of two stars is simply for the stupid furniture that is packed in like you would with a moving truck. Just too dammed confined. They would be better off putting a couple tables out front to serve. Trying to squeeze into one of their small tables I almost knocked one of their priceless works of art that are just hanging balanced on a nail.  If the chef can mature and work on some of his experimental flavors this little eatery should have customers for years.  However if they continue to operate under such cramped conditions people will stop coming in just because of the logistics.",

As mentioned before the pork shoulder taco has cinnamon in it which my girlfriend is allergic to so she switched if for the Sonoran Carne Asada Taco. The carne asada was well done and you could taste the mesquite charcoal it was made on. The salsa bar is another reason why this restaurant is good, due to  how diverse it was. There were so many salsas that we couldn't test them all before the chips ran out; can't remember the names of all of them, but the peanut salsa was awesome.",

I was in disbelief and told my husband that it was time to leave. It was a waste of 15 minutes just standing there.

One of the waiters gave me a bag of chips no charge to take to go with all the yummy salsas! I would definitely be coming back here when I visit Phoenix in the future!",

Would have liked a little more spice, but all were good. Shark taco, colors of the flag burrito was stunning. Another combo (meat, raisins, and apples) that was great. Quesadilla was also great. Not the standard quesadilla but better in my opinion. Small with only 10 tables, and things were a bit slow but more than worth it!!",

That usually doesn't bother me but it's awkward when you're waiting to order while standing next to a table of other diners the whole time. Service was rather slow but there was only 1 cashier during dinner service so it's not her fault, she probably just needed help. That's the only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars. The food is really damn good. I had a bean and cheese burrito and a veggie taco and let me just say the burrito was a super good deal because it was huge and wrapped well (I hate when beans explode out of the tortilla) and the tacos were amazing. It's nice to find a place that serves veggie tacos because it seems like no one else has them in the area.",

    "text": "I'm not a fan of what's annoyingly referred to as \"Tex-Mex\" food, at all. It gives me the idea of pseudo-not-fast-food like Moe's, or lame cantinas, run by people whose ancestors probably couldn't pronounce \"cantina,\" that cater to the effete-minded \"Margaritaville\" crowd.  My wife, however, was attracted to the outside decor and lured in by the \"gourmet\" in the name.  Welp, folks, let me tell you: I'm really glad I went in this place. Their big advertisement is that they want to turn the tide of opinion on Mexican food/Tex Mex whatever from one of greasy, unhealthful junk to tasteful and thoughtfully-prepared fare- to the end of the latter, they did their due on me!  The woman and I had their take on quesadillas, which weren't the usual stupid flat flour tortilla cheese sandwiches with a pile o' salt and a not-pile of meat. In fact, these guys were made from homemade corn tortillas, deep fried (though not doused in grease) and filled well with your menu choice (In my case, al pastor; the wife got mahi-mahi). Folded over like a calzone and topped lightly with cojita sour cream, these guys are filled with flavor- flavor I've not experienced at any other Mexican joint in this city. The light crispiness of the tortilla really drives it home, and the quesadilla in all makes me think more of \"tamale grande\" than what you would classify as a quesadilla. (again, a boring flat cheese sandwich).  The price is kind of high; and while the portion is not *big* big as if you might get from a typical Mexican restaurant around here, let me tell you pals: It's well worth it.  Can't wait to try some new things here, sometime. In the meantime, go and try a quesadilla if you want to be flavor-blasted for the first time in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Wow where to start... If you decide to give this place a try based on their \"good\" ratings and reviews you're better off looking elsewhere. Me and my girlfriend were looking for ordinary tacos and when we noticed the awesome ratings and good reviews this place had achieved, we thought it would be at least decent. When we got there and ordered our drinks, I ordered the horchata because according to people on Yelp, they had the best one could taste. As soon as I got mine, I noticed it had some kind of canned fruit on top, if had some sort of strawberry syrup and to top it off, it had a brownish color instead of the usual white. When I tried it, it was so sweet that one sip is all I could take before I decided to tell the waiter to take it back because I was not going to pay for that. My girlfriend's Jamaica also had a purple color to it and she told me it tasted like grape Kool-aid. When we were attempting to order food, all I wanted from the start was a few simple tacos... Their tacos were $2.97 each!!!  That is absolute madness!!! For the size of the tortilla and the quality of the taco, the MOST those could have been worth anywhere else was $1.25. When everything was going bad and our night had been ruined, me and my girlfriend started looking around and we noticed that only white people were eating there. Then everything made sense; white people don't know REAL mexican food, so they assume this crap quality was the \"best they had ever tasted\" and thus very good review on yelp came from white people. If you know what real mexican food tastes like and are looking for just simple tacos, DO NOT GO TO THIS UTTERLY AMERICANIZED MEXICAN JOINT!!!! You will be sorely disappointed. ANY cheap taco stand in Mexico can beat the taste of these so called \"street tacos\" AND FOR A THIRD OF THE PRICE!!! If I could I would give this place 0 stars.",

    "text": "Recently some of my colleagues from Spain were visiting and on their last night in town, I offered to take them to dinner.   They immediately told me that they NEEDED to have authentic Mexican food and they really wanted tacos.   After searching through pages and pages of Yelp and Google, and polling my friends on facebook...I finally chose La Condesa over many strong recommendations of Los Dos Molinos, Barrio Cafe, Aunt Chiladas, and many more....   Now, I realized that never having been there myself before I was taking a bit of a risk...but my fellow Yelpers surely couldn't lead me astray, right?!     Happily, they did not!   The food was delicious.  The four of us all ordered different kinds of tacos and we all loved our dishes!  I had the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, which I DEFINITELY recommend!  The flavor was amazing! a little heat, a little citrusy....mmm mmm mmm!!   Two of my co-workers had the Carne Asada and they both raved about it the whole way home. we all shared an Horchata for dessert -- wow!  very good too!  It's a big drink, so I do recommend sharing - it's totally worth it!    Their bellies were content before the long flight back to Espana!     The portions were good.  Not too big, not too small.  Two tacos were filling - I always like to know what to expect.  Nobody had any leftovers, so I think the portions were just right.    Of course, the salsa bar is a key feature of this place.  I think we only made it through 5 or 6 kinds and I liked them all.   The mango one was one of my favorites, which is a surprise b/c I'm not usually a huge fan, but I loved the sweet and spicy combo - it was done just right.     I've already sent the link to my foodie brother in law - the whole fam will be visiting for the holidays, we will definitely be going back!   This will be a MUST visit place for my future recommendations!    Yeah!",

I like my restaurants how I like my style, un-cramped; unfortunately, this place is packed full with wall to wall tables and chairs leaving about 3 inches in between you and the guy at the table next to you. Don't plan to come here during the lunch rush with a big group, you're lucky if you can fit one or two people through the door. The parking isn't that appealing either, you are practically parked in the middle of 16th street traffic. :-/  La Condesa makes a pretty good taco, and their salsa ain't bad either. To their benefit, they do have some fairly unique salsa's to choose from, such as strawberry, peanut, and pecan; but in my opinion, unique doesn't necessarily = awesome. Any of their tacos will do you right, but my favorite is their pork.    In my opinion, and lets face it, if you're reading my review, that's exactly what you're looking for right? La Condesa over stated when they went with Gourmet in the name. Sure, everybody likes their taco's but who wants to pay $9 for two tacos and leave feeling like they were packed in like sardines in the middle of a seedy neighborhood? If it isn't obvious yet, I don't plan on coming back soon, I can take or leave their salsas and tacos and wouldn't be bothered either way.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, hope you find that hidden taco gem you've always been searching for.",

They do a good job with the salsa, I must admit.  But I don't see myself going somewhere JuSt for the complimentary salsa.  Do yourself a favor and go a couple blocks over to EL Nopalito's",

    "text": "So, mi media naranja and I were flying out of Phoenix early in the morning: we were headed to Boston for a couple of weeks. I didn't want to get up at the butt-crack of dawn to drive up to PHX from Tucson, so we decided to stay the night close to the airport. Of course the normal \"what do you want for dinner\" conversation started, and we decided we wanted some good Mexican food before we left the desert Southwest. Yelp led us here; when was the last time you saw a 4 1/2 star review with 500-some odd reviews?  Those 4 1/2 stars weren't lying. The salsa bar is ridiculously fantastic! Strawberry salsa? Yes please! I had four helpings of the robano pibil salsa. Chips were sorta warm, nothing incredible; the real star was the salsa. I ordered a couple of al pastor tacos and a Mayan Cochinita pibil. The pastor was delicious, and the Mayan taco?? The pork was mouthwateringly tender and perfectly seasoned. I felt sad when my plate was empty.   My better half had the cabo shrimp taco, which she didn't seem super excited about. The mole taco, however, got her talking; incredibly, she shared a bite with me. I agreed; it was phenomenal.   Service was fast and courteous. I'd take off 1/2 star for using the restrooms as a storage area for extra dining-room chairs. Kinda gross. Overall, though, it was excellent and I am glad we went!",

We arrived shortly after the restaurant opened so we quickly greeted and seated. If you're a first timer the place is small, not much space in between table, be weary if you have younger children. We were given a breakfast menu along with the standard menu. Our daughters had pancakes and scrabbled eggs which they both loved. I am the biggest fan of their horchata. I absolutely love it and sometimes stop by for just that. I order the egg Benedict with the option of red or green chili pork. I told the waiter I wanted red chili and he repeated green. I corrected him and requested red chili. Again, this is a smaller place but busy, so don't expect your food quickly. When our food arrived my entire plate was cold. The side of beans were not warm, but cold. My Benedict, also cold and not red chili but green. The poached egg was more boiled as the yoke was solid and not runny.   I've eaten here before and I have to say this visit was disappointing. I may only return for the horchata or dinner but never again for breakfast.",

There was a 30 minute waiting period, but I expected long wait since we came at 6pm. We wanted to try out their guacamole, but they were already sold out? that kinda saddened me lol.. especially since they ran out of the best salsa in the first 20 mins of us sitting down (least spicy and most flavor). I tried many other ones but none compared. They never bothered to fill it back up either which I didnt understand, but maybe since it was later at night they thought that would be pointless. they were also very busy the whole staff is always running around catering to everyone which I actually loved. The people who work there, work their asses off. I could tell. Plus none of them were rude at all, which is always a great thing because most restaurants dont treat everyone the same. The food was great I cant complain too much. Definitely recommend this for meat eaters though. It caters to vegans with a large selection of options unlike most restaurants, but not the healthiest if you are a real vegan. Corn tortillas aren't exactly healthy, and I have had better fried cauliflower. If you came here with family that wasn't vegan Id say you are safe here for everyone!",

When you have people fly in from out of town and say, \"Take me to a hidden hole-in-the-wall spot\" take them here. When you want to impress a date, your parents, or just have delicious meal... take them here.  If you go at prime dinner time it'll be a 15-30 min wait.  But it's so worth it.  You sit down.  They place a complementary basket of chips and you look to the back where there are 10 different salsas.  Yes ten.  And not this made-in-a-bag BS.  Real fresh stuff.  So you get to experiment with these while you wait for your food to come out.  Next, order the Horchata.  Get only one and share.  They are huge.  Their margaritas are also good. Finally, get something with the black mole and/or oaxacan cheese.    I cannot overstate how amazing their mole sauce is.  All of their food is excellent but the mole... I have no words to describe it.  I have had their black mole tacos, their black mole sandwich and the heavenly Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken Quesa which is more like an empanada.   I am from the Midwest originally.  Before I moved here, I swore off Mexican food.  It was greasy, disgusting, and tasted like hot and salty mush.  This restaurant is probably my single favorite place to eat since moving here 3 years ago.  Treat yourself to this place.  You deserve to know happiness.",

They also serve Mexican Coke Cola which is better than regular Cola.  The quesadilla was far from a traditional flour tortilla. It was some kind of a pita tortilla. It was delicious.   The shrimp tiger tacos were so authentic and cook to perfection. The street tacos taste just like the taco shops in Ensenada Mexico. The rice was cooked with a buttery taste which my taste buds could not refuse and beans were good as well. They have the salsa bar with such a large variety of salsa. The cream salsa, cilantro salsa and the chunky salsa were all wonderful options to put on the shrimp and fish tacos together.   Believe me I wanted to hate this place, But everything they did wrong like take 40 mins to bring food Was so worth it.

    "text": "So people rave about their food here. I had the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco, Cabo Shrimp Taco, Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco and the Santisima taco. They were good. The seafood tacos were basic but good, I wish they put more effort into the slaw they put on them. The other two tacos were shined much more. The big hitter of the meal was actually the salsa. I would come back to this place and just eat salsa and chips it was that good. I had a house margarita and took one sip and non another sip it was gross. Overall stick to the taco, salsa, chips and a beer (don't touch the margarita), stick to that and it will be most likely in your top 10 Mexican restaurants you have ever eaten at.",

Outside the place looked a little sketchy, but inside it looked like a typical taco spot. We got fresh chips to start. And then we ordered about 3 tacos per person (all of them were good!).  The best thing about this place is their salsa bar. They have everything from pico to strawberry to pecan salsa. Some were spicy, some sweet. It's insane. And delicious.  Pretty cool and simple taco spot in Phoenix. Small dining area though, so don't get mad if there's a wait.",

Every bite is a flavor party, including the array of succulent salsas ranging from chipotle to creamy cilantro. The spicy jalapenos are truly spicy, turning me into a fire-breathing dragon for moments after I ate them.  This restaurant does justice to vegetarians, all veggies are sauteed with care and attention to spices. The mole nearly made my partner dance, dark and intricate like a Spanish tango. My Santisima quesa was a revelation, full of flavor and topped with Mexican crema, a thick corn crust that managed not to be greasy.  And the horchata? It's the real deal. We shared a margarita that tasted natural and refreshing, not a bottled mix in the house.",

    "text": "La Santisma has some loft reviews and on top of that it has been visited by Guy Fieri.  You probably already know that if you're reading this review.  Those two items equate to a chance for a letdown of epic proportions.  I'm happy to report this place lived up to the hype and then some.  It is really small in terms of dining space, so arrive early or be prepared to wait.  Also straddling up to the bar is a good strategy to get seated as well.  The salsa selection is extraordinary - I think there were 10 or so different offerings ranging from pico to sesame.  If you're a lover of all things fire, definitely go for their hotter sauces but beware as these pack a punch.    The menu is loaded with tacos - this is Santisma's speciality.  Very vegetarian friendly but it also has choices if you're feeling like more of a carnivore.  I went with the fried avocado, cactus and la santisma tacos - all were awesome.  These things are big and they come double wrapped in tortillas so definitely keep that in mind.  Santisma also has a wide variety of margaritas available and to top it off - free chips (first serving).  Go!  This place is legit!",

Grilled (special order so it's not on the menu, but just ask and they will accomodate). I feel like it brings out the flavor of the shark better. I also love getting their tacos (any of them) with grilled shrimp (also special order and not on the menu).   I just don't like deepfried stuff haha but this place is amazing.  Everyone says their guac is great but I think it's overrated. I love that it's chunky and tastes fresh.. but it's sometimes lacking in flavor because they make this in bulk. When making things like this in bulk, it can be hard to evenly spread the ingredients. Skip the guac and invest in another taco!",

It was like pulling nails to get someone to take our order. And to get a refill on my water took entirely too long.   But even worse was the smell of sewage in the back dining room. As soon as we walked in I smelled it. I don't know if there is a leak or what's going on back there, but it was very distracting and made eating there very difficult for me. I thought it was coming from the women's bathroom since it's RIGHT THERE (gross) but it turned out to be coming from the back storage room that opened up into the dining room.   Again food was great, ad my Blue Demon Margarita was sensational.",

    "text": "How can I not like this place? It has my name written all over it!  I came here on a Saturday night to sample this popular gourmet taco shop. I stepped into the dark interior which had a Day of the Dead decor and filled with ten tables for hungry diners.  The menu is divided into five sections:  Gourmet Tacos or Gourmet Taquetzin Street Tacos Gourmet Burros or Cazuela Bowl  Gourmet Corn - Quesadillas Lonches  I ordered the Al Pastor Burro (spicy pork, salsa, pineapple, veggies) $9 and Daniel got the Tlaloc Vegan Burro (mesquite grilled cactus, caramelize onion, veggies and cheese) $9. Both of them did not have rice or beans inside (a.k.a. fillers) and still kept it hardy but not overstuffed. My Al Pastor had the spiciness and sweetness which you typically find but what made this burro special, was it was grilled on the top and bottom and the fillings were made from high quality ingredients. And for you cheese lovers, you won't find it inside but I'm sure you can request it. The burro was a healthy alternative and the cactus had a nice texture. My only complaint was it needed additional salsa to add to the flavor. Be warned ... take a Beano before this meal!  All meals came with a basket of tortilla chips and unlimited trips to the salsa bar which had at least ten different types of homemade salsa to experiment. Most of them had a kick of spice to it and you can pick from chunky vs. smooth salsas. My favorite was mixing the Salsa Mexicana and Avocado Salsa. Talk about double dippin'! The Salsa Chipotle was also another favorite for us.  Personally, the lighting was a little darker than I preferred during dinner. I wouldn't call it romantic but rather adventurous!  Since it was a busy night, the two servers were on their toes and the wait for the food was reasonable. They had an extensive cocktail list with many of the diners enjoying their margaritas and homemade horchatas.   I hope to return to try the mole street tacos and say I ate at \"Santisima\"!",

    "text": "La Santisima is a gourmet taco restaurant located about 3 miles away from downtown Phoenix and was featured in Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Drives (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foodnetwork.com%2Fvideos%2Fla-santisima-gourmet-tacos-0246581&s=c09bc90efbb252eb27bac95fa4e5de53ecadce9fd1ef0f69cc3da824c11f17a1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">foodnetwork.com/videos/l...</a>). In fact, I noticed the signed Diners, Drive-Ins, and Drives memorabilia hanging near the front entrance of the restaurant. There is actually another La Santisima location at Glendale, AZ and one of my friends mistakenly drove to the Glendale location due to miscommunication. Our waiter was someone who just started the job a day ago and he said a lot of people ordered guacamole - I took his advice and it was definitely a great recommendation.  Menu: I have tried plenty of street tacos in Los Angeles, but oh boy the La Santisima's menu completely overwhelmed me. There are just so many regional tacos (Yucatan, Oaxaca, Ensenada, Mexico City, Sonora, Baja Sur, Guadalajara City, etc) to choose from! In addition to tacos, the menu also includes lonches (pretty much like torta), burritos, quesadillas, and botanas / sopas / caldos / ensalada.  Salsa Bar: 14 different options such as pecan salsa, peanut salsa, cilantro salsa, Cabo salsa, Mexicans salsa, pico de gallo, etc. Each table gets a basket of complimentary chips and extra chip will cost $2.70. HOWEVER, you will also get another basket of complimentary chips if you do order a side of guacamole.  ***  [Mix & Match Plates (3 tacos with rice & beans) for $13.98 (extra charge if you choose any tacos from the La Santisima Gran Reserva Tacos) - all tacos had two layers of corn tortilla]  [Taco 1] La Santisima Specialty (toasted Oaxaca cheese, mushrooms, poblano pepper, onion, spinach, fresh garlic grilled with olive oil, special salsa cilantro served with your selection of meat - steak; extra $0.99 for plate): Excellent and flavorful steak with crazy toppings - this was the best one out of the three I tried. (4.75/5)  [Taco 2] Mayan Cochinita Pibil (12-hour slow cooked roasted pork shoulder until fork tender marinated with Achiote Mayan rojo, Mexican herbs, wrapped in a banana leave topped with pickle onions; extra $0.51 for plate): It was one of the Yelp recommendations, but I thought this pork shoulder taco tasted just okay. This was my least favorite taco out of the three. (3.5/5)  [Taco 3] Baja Sur Baby Shark (Corn tortilla filled with beer battered wild baby shark cazon, cabbage, salsa cilantro & mayo; extra $0.51 for plate): Well seasoned and tender fish taco. I liked La Santisima Specialty just a little bit more, but I will not shy away from ordering this taco. (4.5/5)  [Rice & Beans]: Rice tasted slightly sweet and bean had a slight spicy kick. Both were very good. (5/5)  Guacamole (aguacate, cilantro, chile serrano, onion, tomato, mango, jicama, cranberries; half for $6.99): It also came with a basket of complimentary chips. One of the slightly sweeter guacamole that I have tried and I really like it. (5/5)  Horchata (Family recipe fruits and pecans; $4.50): Talk about a huge bottle! A very unique horchata with strawberry and a hint of cinnamon. It was a very solid horchata and just slightly sweet for my taste. (4.25/5)  ***  Recommendations: Don't eat too much chips and get hook on salsa bar or guacamole because you will not have enough room to finish your tacos. Tacos aren't exactly cheap here, but this is really the taco shop for foodies in general.",

We spent a few minutes admiring the artwork that adorned the walls throughout the restaurant.    This is really a homey sort of small place, but the variety of choices is impressive.  A large variety of tacos and tortas are the main choices.  Fish, shrimp, chicken, beef and pork are protein choices for Oaxacan mole, Tinga, chipotle, Sonoran and several other flavorings.   The black mole is a standout.  Slightly sweet with a strong earthy flavor - it was a favorite at our table.     The salsa bar has close to a dozen different choices for chipping/dipping and adding to some of the tacos.  My order of Grilled Calabacitas fell a bit short.  You usually don't order this unless you really like it.  Only a few rounds (8-10) of thinly cut zucchini served on a large platter.  A smaller plate would have made these tasty morsels seem like more but actually, more would have made it seem like more!  One of our group is a perfectionist and was put-off by the chipped terracotta plates and platters used as serving pieces.  They seemed very at home with the restaurant's decor.  Mine was scraped clean of any extra bits.  Service was quick and efficient.  They may have been a bit understaffed but our group of six had no complaints.",

I had the fish and chicken Tinga taco and my daughter had the Carne Asada tacos. My came with the most moist and flavorful rice with a lighter side of beans. The chips were served warm and we had a variety of salsas for dipping. The standout salsa has to be the smooth and creamy cilantro. Soooo goooood.  Ok, the fish taco was served with coleslaw. The corn tortilla was doubled and made to perfection. Probably the best fish taco I ever ate. I will dine here again before I leave Phoenix.   Well, came back for dinner and was not disappointed. Tacos rice and beans were delicious. I had a brisket taco that was grilled in shell with seasoning and sauteed onions on the exterior of shell. Yum. This will be a regular stop every time I'm in Phoenix. I've been cooking for years and don't know How do they cook the rice??? It's so good.",

This place has an amazing salsa bar with things like a 7 Chili Salsa, Peanut Salsa (think Vietnamese Peanut sauce crossed with hot peppers - amazing!), Radish Salsa Jicama Salsa (Jicama,  Cilantro and Lime - yum), Pico de Gallio, Green Salsa, Red Salsa.. I think there were 12 in total.  Too bad the chips were a bit stale and not that special.  The gourmet tacos were amazing.  Try the house special asada.  I also had the chicken rings, pastor and a plain asada.   All were hot, juicy and flavorful. This is going to be a regular stop when I am in Phoenix.

All the tacos are loaded. I worked out before and was full with 4 tacos. I tried:  La Santisima Special taco: again loaded with cheese, and steak. A juicy satisfying mess. Would come back for this.  Mariachi loco taco: crispy, toasted shell with tasty barbacoa and onion filling. My second favourite after the La Santisima Special.  Cabo Tiger Shrimp taco. Loaded with juicy battered shrimp. A really good combination with the cilantro and cabbage  Anda Lucia taco: This was my least favourite but it's because I'm not a huge fan of beans. But the chorizo and potato are juicy delicious.",

I've been twice, both experiences were about 1:30-2p in the afternoon, aka the end of most restaurants lunch rush. The first time, the waiter spilled Sprite on my husband and apologized but never came back to help with it because they were so busy. BUT THAT FILET BURRITO THOUGH. Took damn near an hour but it was so freeeeaking delish. So, I went again, with the same naivete as most of you, hoping it was an off day. W R O N G. Today we waited 10 minutes for water, 15 minutes for chips and 50 minutes for food. 1.5 hrs in total for a (holyeffingshit) $17 delicious chicken burrito plate, some tacos and a horchata.   Being in the industry, I was watching the people around me like a hawk-- I cannot help it. Restaurant management runs through my blood and is 99.8% of the time a curse because I notice every flipping detail and rarely enjoy myself when out to eat. Today, I noticed two servers in a packed restaurant. Maybe 3-4 kitchen staff. No bartender although a lot of booze was being ordered. I watched 3 customers walk out after not being greeted at their table and 9 (yes, nine) take off after waiting at the door for a table for way too long when there were clean tables inches from them. People were making their frustrations known and some were honestly pretty pissed. I am really confused why they don't switch to counter service, it make SO much more sense for their concept.    No mediocre free salsa bar and damn tasty but super overpriced food is worth this kind of service.",

Strawberry margarita is worth trying, like their taco plate but it was all a bit over priced. $13 for 3 small but tasteful tacos with a side of rice & beans, I however, substituted the beans for an extra side of rice. Authentic Mexican but with a bit of a twist. Salsa bar was unique but the dishes are sample sized and only your first basket of chips are free. The rice is so good, especially if you add some lime juice! Overall good experience but probably won't go out of the way to go back, mostly just because you pay more than you should.",

I had the shrimp tacos, Barbacoa tacos and the best taco I have ever eaten, the nueva espana (roasted pork). We also shared the queso which is literally just a bowl of melted, gooey delicious cheese. I could've eaten the whole thing myself. I absolutely recommend the queso and the espana tacos to anyone who is looking for great Mexican food! It was very busy for a Monday afternoon but it was well worth the wait and the cost.

However, bygones. While I didn't love my veggie lonche, it was obviously very fresh and prepared with care. Also, please refill the salsa bar more frequently so that I won't be tempted to get too much of the really spicy ones and burn the he** out of my mouth. And put more tequila in the (non-happy hour) margaritas. Thank you! Amalia C. P.S. Your chairs are too heavy. P.P.S. In reflection, maybe this was more of a 2-star for me personally but my husband really liked his street al pastor and carne asada taco plato and again, it all seemed fresh. So I bumped you up. You're welcome!",

Unfortunately, the waiter did not put our two courses in properly, so after waiting an hour, everything came at once. This was only after we asked about it. The waitress apologized and did comp our beverages. We are our entrees and wrapped up the first course to eat the next day. We will try it again and hopefully they won't be as busy or their kitchen will have their act together.",

Anyhow, the quesadillas are fried, so if you shy away from fried food, don't even go there. The salsa bar is the best I've ever seen and I enjoy mostly all of what they have available. I like the arracherra taco, the tinga taco and the guacho taco. Perhaps I have spelled those incorrectly, I'm not sure but whatever you get it's going to be good. I do not however, like the beans. I don't know what it is or why, I just don't like them. I do like the rice with the corn in it but generally speaking I just get the tacos a la carte. OH and the Horchata? OMG, get it I promise you even if you don't like Horchata you will probably like this. It is huge though and has fruit and nuts and wow, it's just good. I like the Jamaica (sp?) juice too, but who doesn't :-P... Obviously, I don't speak spanish sorry for my awful spelling. Everyone should try it here, but they are small and get busy so try to find a time not everyone will be going to eat.",

I am a huge huge fan of the food and service, and everything else about this place except one thing.  While eating with a friend from Tucson, he recognized the art on the walls as being the art of famous San Francisco artist Sylvia Ji.   So we called the owner over to ask about the artist.  She told us all the art was by Mexican artists Manuel Gilavalos y Garcia and Ricardo Ramirez.   These are obvious reproductions of a young artist who is currently very hot and exhibiting all over the world.   How has La Condesa gotten away from this for so long?        The owners probably have no idea, but this is some shameful shit, and as great of a reproduction as it looks and makes the little restaurant feel,  Sylvia should be notified and should cease and desist on these \"artists\".      Google Sylvia Ji  and check the La Condesa website and compare the art, and you'll see what Im talking about.   One of the paintings in there is an EXACT replica of one of her paintings.",

The horchata is home made and the best I've ever had! They top it with cinnamon, pecans, strawberries, & cantaloupe. It sounds weird, but it was very good. They also use extremely fresh, crisp cabbage on their tacos. It was very impressive! My boyfriend had the pork shoulder \"quesa\" which is actually a fried quesadilla and that was also very very very good. We will be back.  My ONLY complaint is that I ordered two different tacos & got two of the same tacos... But it was still very delicious & we will go back to try anything else that sounded good.",

    "text": "I couldn't put off my ravenous feelings anymore after leaving work the other night and pulled over at La Condesa. I had been meaning to try it for quite some time. So what if I was a party of one. Satiation is more important than social appearances. The place is in a mildly sketchy area next to a little market that sells pinatas and a few groceries. To me, this actually lended the place some street cred. Anyway, I like how the restaurant's interior has none of the feeling of a Baja Fresh or Chipotle yet the prices are pretty reasonable. The dining room doesn't look like it can fit too many people so I'm wondering what it's like on weekends. The bathrooms were reasonably clean and I got a kick out of the whole lucha libre motif in the bano for the chicas.   I had a pork mole burro with the mole made with chocolate and nuts. Muy sabrosos but the meat was a tad salty or too kicky, not sure if it was the tanginess or salt that had me asking for more water. But I think that is more a matter of personal taste buds, not the reflection on the cooking. I found the meat quite tender. And I felt like a wimp only being able to eat half the burro. Next time, I will probably do the two-taco deal. There was only one gal doing all the bills and service. She was quite nice.   But what will make me come back again is their awesome salsa buffet. It makes the salsa trays at chain restaurants look like plainer, less adventurous salsitas. I had the strawberry salsa (sweet yet salty), jicama, cilantro (my favorite but found if you have too much too soon, you'll feel lit) and peanut. It got to the point where I had to tell myself \"no more chips\" so I simply sucked the salsa off a chip like it was a spoon. Yup, it reduced me to that. Anyway, I do need to go back and get some more ideas of the food. But for now, I'm a fan.",

This will be my new favorite along with the cabo shrimp taco: big fresh and juicy shrimp fried to perfection! I also love their quesadillas...not like anything you would get anywhere else.",

The Shark Taco was good until I ran into a huge piece that was so tough that I couldn't get my teeth to sink into it. The carne asada tacos meat was a bit tough and cold. The pork taco was pretty good and the meat was tender.  The salsa bar was the most interesting and yummy thing in the place. I loved the cilantro salsa the most.  If you go there you may want to pick a time when it's a little more busy. Not sure if my food was at its best since it was just before dinner? Not sure. I will give it another try though. Each taco was about 3.50 each. There are a lot better taco joints in the area though.",

The service is not good, it is understaffed, the restaurant itself is small and there are a boat load of people there. If you like eating some kick ass Mexican food though, this place tops the list. I had the pork and bean burrito with a side of their chipotle salsa. The meat was so tender and the flavor was so developed, I wept a little with each bite. This is on my radar for the next time I come out to Phoenix.  Just hope they find a bigger location or open a taco truck.",

It's too slow and inattentive and they just don't give a damn, so I'll take my $33 elsewhere.  This time we were disappointed by the food, too. We returned our horchata for being too thin and tasteless, and you brought us new ones after we finished eating. You drizzled a pretty crema all over the top of my torta (sorry, lonche). How do I pick it up and eat it?   In the past we forgave the dirty tables and loudness because your cochinita pibil was pure bliss. But not even that makes up for the service. :(",

I cannot comment on any other items as I am extremely satisfied with the mole and don't venture far from it.  I think you can order chicken mole tacos but I am unsure.  The salsa bar is tasty, too.    Apparently there is a Happy Hour on weekdays.  I noticed Tequila behind the bar but didn't see any beer and am unaware of what the Happy Hour entails.",

My BF and I arrived just after 7pm, which was perfect because just after we ordered the place filled up- fast!  The salsa bar is fantastic! Some of my fave's were the peanut, chipotle, strawberry and a chunky dark one who's name escapes me..... But really they were all good.  The very best taco that we tried was the Cochinita Pibil (sp?) It was heavenly- packed with meat that had a kind of smokey, kind of mole/chocolaty taste- it was incredible. All the taco's we had were great though. To start with- the tortillas are so freaking good on their own, and they pack the meat inside of them. I'm getting hungry just thinking about them.  Lastly, my BF is a lifelong connoisseur  of quesadillas, so we ordered a steak one to split. Holy crap- it was a monster! They split it up for us but it looked like we ordered two of them! Humongous! It resembled a strudel pastry! Big, flaky and lightly drizzled with something white, sour cream maybe? I dunno, but it was to die for!  Even the next day when we reheated our leftovers this cheesy doughy meaty concoction was still fantastic! The chicken tinga burrito was almost BETTER the following day! (Maybe because it didnt have to compete with any tacos)!   All in all we were very satisfied and will definitely be back. I would like to wait for a bit cooler weather though, because the place is quite warm inside. That is why I only gave it four stars.",

At dinner, and during slower traffic times, they are very attentive and ensure that you have everything you need.  The food. Where do I begin. I will start with the amazing salsa bar. They have about a dozen salsas per day. Fresh. My favorite is the seven chile salsa which is simply roasted chiles and red onions. They are all amazing though.  As far as the tacos, I have only ever eaten the pibil and the mole, and that's because they are so good, that I can't branch out yet. Every time I go, those are the ones I am craving. The pibil is so good that it makes me fully appreciate Johnny Depp's character in \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\" having such a love of good pibil.   If you go at lunch, go before 11:30 to beat the crowd. This is one of my favorite places to eat. Hands down. Get some horchata to go as well. They top it with fruit and pecans. Yum!",

While waiting, i loaded up on the condiments. Got my order in a reasonable time and bicycled to Coronado park to feast. Hands down, the best fish tacos i have had. California, Hawaii and New Mexico cannot compete with these fish tacos. Did not know this \"gem\" was featured on D,D & D. Any person who fails to give 5 starts is just being a pinche pendeho.

We got our bill and it says 21.99. So we asked why and she said it's because they changed the menu. Well.. not the 4 menus that we were given. Instead of fixing it, she argued with us and tried to find a menu with the new price. when she couldn't produce one, she said she would need to call the owner blah blah. seriously?! and then she takes another 15minutes talking on the phone with the owner, I'm assuming, instead of dealing with her waiting customers. left such a bad taste in my mouth. in the end, she changed the charge to 15.99, to which i left a $6 tip and a scathing note on how they can have their money back. we will never return to this place.",

    "text": "For the last several months America's Taco has ruled the downtown Taco scene.  Now just across the neighborhood a new rival emerges.  Not since Magic and Bird graced the hardwood have we seen the seeds for so tasty a rivalry.   From the great Mexican artesenia laden decor to the great service to the impeccable salsa bar- try the strawberry or peanut salsa- the place is top notch. The menu is diverse so it merits several repeat visits for purposes of exploration.  I'm still a novice but I am completely sold on the cochinita pibil.  The pork is as tender and flavorful as anything you will get up the street at the Barrio Cafe.   The place is still young.  But the rate at which incredible reviews surface on Yelp , it is testament enough that it deserves your patronage.",

I look over the menu and the salsa bar and man did it look good. I was hoping there was a sample platter or something but the best I could come up with was the 2 Taco meal.   I opted for the Chicken and the pork, one of each.   What I liked:  -Chips with out having to order them separate.   -Tacos full of meat.  -Staff was nice -Rice and Beans were good.  -The salsa bar...way cool  Meh:   -Corn shell was overcooked on 1/2 (one side) -meat was boring without salsa, good thing there is like 20 to choose.   It seems like the upscaled two hippies and it worked! 3.5 out of 4",

As a native of Phoenix Arizona I can say unequivocally this IS the Best Barbecue I have ever had in all my 39 years of breathing.  My first visit and it won't be my last.  As soon as you walk into the restaurant the beautiful mouthwatering aroma filled the air.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and a cornbread muffin.  My hubby got the Big Boy Sampler which included a sample of all their meats; smoked sausage, pulled pork, pulled chicken, and beef brisket.  I ordered a fountain drink RC and found a seat.  To my delightful surprise I had the choice of 4 different sauces to compliment my delicious succulent barbecue.  I also had a taste of the chicken, sausage, and brisket thanks to my loving husband who shared some of his sampler.  After I enjoyed my lunch I met the manager Jake and told him how much I liked everything and how I will be coming back. Whether you are visiting Phoenix or a resident like me Pulled Pork on a Fork is a must!",

    "text": "Ambience: A Cleanliness: A Customer Service: B Food: B+   Price  -It is fairly inexpensive. Compared to other places I've been to in the area I think its in that cheap to moderate range.   Atmosphere -It looks like a hole in the wall when you walk in and its kinda of a turn off, but when you go to the large dinning area its really nice so the moral of the story is don't judge a book by its cover (or its entry way in this case I guess)   Customer Service  You order and pay at the counter as if it were a fast food place, but if you are staying they give a number and someone brings the food to you. It's fine, but I think because they have the huge dinning room, they should just take it the extra step and offer full service. I think it would just add a little extra something to the experience.   Food  So I spent an entire week in Arizona eating nothing but tacos, burritos and enchiladas and I've had all three at this restaurant (we visited twice) and I'd say its food falls right in the middle. It is not the best Mexican food I've had locally, but it is fairly close to the top. If their meat had just a little bit more flavor it would probably be one of my favorites. Their drinks however are AMAZING!   Overall I think this is a solid lunch or dinner place. Good food, good price, I just wish it was a little bit more upscale by adding wait service.",

The description said mango, so we expected slices of mango, but no. It had chunks that got stuck in the straw. Which was annoying but drink was still good. Then came our food, we ordered street tacos with rice and beans. I ordered pastor tacos which come with pineapples, when they came, they only had about 2 pineapples on them. Our waitress brought us a cup of some more, which made up for it. Then, my boyfriend, ordered 2 pastor tacos and 1 Ranchera taco. He ate the pastor first, then went on to eat the last. After his first bite, he said it was weird, but didn't know how to explain how. So my mom and I tasted it, and it tasted so bad. Not flavor wise but like it was old & expired. That's the best way I can describe it. They brought him a different taco but he had a bad taste in his mouth after that. Quite literally. Pretty skeptical about coming back.",

They use fresh ingredients in all of their dishes and the salsa bar has the most unique salsas with food parings I would never have thought of...it makes it worth your trip. The owners have added additional seating area which is a great investment as it is always packed and the artwork on display adds to the cultural ambiance of the establishment. Every person that I have shared the establishment with has thanked me for sharing this wonderful, cultural gem.  Things to keep in mind: the parking is off street which gets tricky during lunch rush 11-1, service is good but they don't check back on you and having to stand in line first thing coming through the door to order your food seems a bit backwards for most sit down food establishments so that is why I give it the four stars.",

The margaritas are also pretty delicious based on the sips I had from others. The horchata is pretty unique with the added fruit and is not as creamy as other preparations but is still refreshing!

Oh yeah, if you are a man and see a bathroom door open next to the salsa bar, that is not for you.  The men's room is hidden over by the bar and kitchen.  Its great food.  I tried not to waste any salsa so I just got small cups and kept going back and trying new stuff.  Most of which were good, but one of the chili ones tasted kind of fishy for some reason.  As for my entree I went with 3 tacos with beans and rice.  I ate the fried shrimp tacos first as I didn't want the batter to get soggy.  The mole taco was spot on as well as the especial.  I don't live in the southwest, so I can't really compare to much, but I thought it was a great meal for not too much money.",

I've decided to order just tacos and all were delicious. In order of best to least favorite was shrimp taco, fish taco, Aztec tinga taco (chicken), and finally a Sonoran carne asada.

After finally taking my order, the gentleman hands me back partial change and tells me that I have to wait for the rest of my change ($5). I was surprised because they were busy and as a professional establishment you should definitely have $5 change readily available. Gentleman said it would be 10-15 mins for my food to be ready. Took them 5 mins to get me the rest of my change. I filled salsas, brung them to my car and went back inside to wait for my food. There were 4 different couples waiting to be seated, looking extremely uncomfortable.  After overhearing one of them ask their partner \"Is this a bad joke?\" , I asked them how long they had been waiting...20 mins! There were plenty of tables open where these people could have been seated and had drinks at the least.  Finally got my food 35 mins later. If I was the owner, I would fire the hostess. Everyone else seemed to be TRYING to do their job. Seemed as though maybe she was trying to get fired with the way she was treating customers.   Again; food is amazing...but this is my 3rd bad experience with customer service here.",

The decor was unusual and had an interesting botanica vibe going on.  Service was a bit slow but they were so packed that I wasn't surprised.  Their salsa bar had more flavors than I've ever seen at a restaurant anywhere--and I've been to a lot of Mexican Restaurants.  As for the food itself, there was nothing \"traditional\" about it, but everything was so bursting with incredible flavor that I was savoring every bite.  Holy sh*t, that was good.  My burrito was loaded with CHUNKS of marinated steak--not ground, not shredded, but chunks.  I was blown away.  Next time, there's a SHARK burrito on the menu that I can't wait to taste.  If you're in the mood for something \"traditional\", I still point people to Mi Patio in Phoenix.  However, if you're looking for something other than the same old Mexican taste, may I recommend this landmark.  It's just a few blocks north of McDowell on your right hand side.  You won't regret it.  The place is small and can sometimes be packed with noisy gringos, but the taste is unforgettable.",

You need to go to cashier and place it then it will be brought to you. 2- park on the side of the building, easier to get in and out. 3- make use of the salsa bar. Very good and probably different from what you've had in the past. Food was very good and had great flavor. I did order a drink that took a long time to come out but the manager gave it to me on the house. Can't complain. No big deal and the mint drink was delicious. We enjoyed this restaurant",

The beautiful entrance door caught my attention and decided to try it.  Since I broke my foot, I'm crutchin' along with the dang boot on my left foot. I must have arrived minutes before the lunch rush. I sat at a little table in a corner. Waitress took my order.  Because the tables are so close to one another and filled, I couldn't go to the Salsa bar to try a few sauces.   I ordered the guacamole which was yummy -- love guaca guaca! When I ordered two chicken tacos, I expected two nice size tacos. Instead I felt as though I ordered two tacos off the menu section for kids.  Waitress never returned to refill my glass of tea. I may return and give this place a try when I'm no longer in need of crutches. Nothing grand here...now run along kids...  PS...They do not accept AMEX!",

I don't know, but I get excited thinking about it.  Now I'm just never going to suffer ambiance without the tastiest of food, because I do go to restaurants for the food, primarily.  I like one-of-a-kind, personal restaurants, because you know you are in the kitchen of someone who fed people they loved first, and then spread it out.  But I've taken a date there because its a fun slightly chaotic festive-feeling place while still feeling like its neighborhood,  it's not particularly quiet, but not at all too loud to hear, tables kind of close together, which kind of forces everyone to smile at and speak to strangers more than your average dining experience.  We love to bring a crowd from out of town, as it feels really homey, and is colorful, tasty, friendly, can be hard to get a table because its small and they do get busy, but just wait.  Worth the wait. Their Al Pastor makes my mouth really happy.",

Had a couple of regular margaritas...be careful, they sneak up on you but were tasty and went very well with the various salsas.  When we first walked in and were waiting (very small waiting area) they gave us some type of orange margarita which reminded me of something you would expect on the beach somewhere.  It was good but I like the traditional ones.  My guest and I both had the fried quesadilla (one pork and one beef)...WONDERFUL!  I recommend this place if you are in the area.

    "text": "Cravings during pregnancy is no joke. So when my pregnant self wanted some Horchata and Mexican food, yelp offered this restaurant as an option. I was half way out the door when I saw a picture of their Horchata. Although this establishment is almost 30 min away from where I live, I will go to great lengths to satisfy my cravings.   The restaurant was small - fits like 25-30 people small. But it was cozy and vibrantly decorated in Dia de Los Muertos theme. My friend and I had a hard time figuring out whether we were to seat ourselves or if we were to wait for a host/hostess to seat us. There was no hostess stand and the staff looked to consist of about 4 people (all extremely busy). After much confusion and waiting time the man who we can only assume was the owner sat us (we walked up to the register to ask).   The Horchata was excellent; and the food was even better. I will say my most favorite was the Pacific White Fish taco but the Black Mole Shrimp taco was just as delicious. My friend ordered the Maria Sabina Quesa which consisted of Oaxaca cheese and sauteed mushrooms deep fried in a corn quesadilla topped with Mexican sour cream and queso cotija. I am not used to eating a quesadilla this way but I don't think I can go back to the flat, boring quesadillas that I used to know.   I love that this restaurant is authentic to Mexico and incorporates flavors from all regions of the country. I believe the reputation of the food is True to other yelpers' reviews however I have to comment on the under par service we received. I realized at one point that the service took a hit probably because the owner and sister/gf/wife (???) were noticeably feuding. I hope it was just an off day and am most definitely looking forward to my return.",

    "text": "Wow. I was in Tempe for 4 days - aside from hitting up the usual faves like In-N-Out since I made the mistake of living in a state that doesn't have one, this was my other highlight.  Space is limited, but going early (i.e. 4:30 pm on a Sat) seemed to beat the rush, we left past 5pm and it still wasn't packed yet, but did hear it fills up quickly.  My only complaint was that I wish I had a bigger stomach to try all the different tacos. The friend that took me said they never has ordered off the first page (Taco Page) because its so good, and now I can see why.   Tip: Once you get your table, make your way straight to the salsa bar and start filling up your little cups. They'll bring chips to your table ASAP.  Don't waste time sitting there waiting for your server, go get your salsa!   Also, I'm not a huge Horchata fan, but the Horchata there was super tasty. It's also 32oz, so share, or go pee a lot.",

They carry Mexican beers that I have never heard of before, last time I had an Estrella and it was delicious. They have a full bar with tons of exotic tequilas and they are generous on the pours.  The servers are attentive and sweet and the set up is old style cool.   What really keeps me coming back is the salsa bar (oh the salsa bar)! Pecan salsa, 7 pepper, chipotle, sesame... They carry over a dozen and you will have to come many times to experience the perfect salsa/taco combination. It is worth every delectable trip!",

First of, we weren't acknowledged when my family and I came in. We wasn't sure if we were supposed to choose our own seating or someone would assign one. Took about 5-10 mins for the server to ask if we wanted something to drink. She the brought the chips and most of the salsa are out and not being replenished at the salsa bar. All three women servers are walking around and passing us like we have not been waiting for 40 minutes for one order. I had to really wave at the server to get her attention. The order finally came in after waiting for 1 hour and to top it off, the server handed us our food without any apologies for the long wait and not even an eye contact. I'm all about customer service and if I was to based my rating on their service that night, it would be a 1 star. The food was great tho, but definitely not worth waiting an hour especially when the restaurant is not even pack.",

I loved the idea of having a taco to represent the cuisine of so many different latin american places.  I also loved the salsa bar with its dozen or so unlimited salsas.  However, the food its self was nothing to write home about.  We tried six different tacos, and none of it seemed particularly fresh or interesting.  Had to rely heavily on the salsas to revive the tired tacos.  Doubt I'll be coming back.",

    "text": "Really awesome tacos here. I ordered the black mole and the conchinita pibil tacos. One of each and a steak queso. I didn't expect everything to be so big so I really over did myself. The queso I figured was like a quesadilla but it really isn't anything like that. Closest description is a calzone sized gordita. And not the taco bell version. The cheese was gooey and the undercooked parts of the masa were delicious. It was awesome. I broke out the plastic utensils and went to town. Daunting none the less. But I managed to put down half of it before the coma kicked in   The mole taco was delicious. The chicken was sliced and covered in red onion. The sauce was spicy and not sweet at all. And the whole thing melted in my mouth. The corn taco shells are soft and made to order. The conchinita pibil taco was full of flavor and dripped juices all over the basket. Delicious.   The horchata is unbelievable. Full of fruit and pecans as well as cinnimon and nutmeg.  the salsa bar is epic. there was at least 12 different salsas to try. the cilantro was really good. and i normally hate raw cilantro because i burp it. but this was excellent and really brought out the flavor of my food. also the strawberry salsa was hot with a hint of sweet and freshness. and the salsa peanut was very tasty. very. very.  I'm buying a bike just to ride here.  A lowerider bike with two 20's in a trailer. So I can rock all the way there.  for now condesa....you are in my top 10.",

Like other reviewers, I'm partial to the Oaxaca black mole chicken and the cochinita pibil. Everything is delicious in any delivery system -- taco, burro, or (gooey and vaguely depraved) quesa.  The salsa bar really gets me, though. Experiencing it is to suffer total cognitive arrest and disorganization; it's like love at first sight or stumbling upon a work of great art. Peanut, cilantro, de arbol... bring a sharpie so you can mark the little plastic cups and remember your favorites.  Bonus points: The server remembered that I'd asked for strawberry salsa (they were out) on my last visit eight days prior, and offered a totally above-and-beyond apology. Must be something in the mole that sharpens the memory.   Great place -- a gem.",

    "text": "Third visit to La Condesa and that's enough to give it a review. I like the flavors, which are largely guided by your personalized salsa choices, but find it to be a bit heavy in portions.  La Condesa is really ALL about the salsa... not just for the chips but utilizing the bar during the whole visit to create your own perfect balance of flavors. Dishes are dialed into a low volume in order to let the salsa sing.  If your meal's not right, it may be that you're putting peanut salsa on charred beef rather than chicken or vegetables.  PORTIONS + VALUE Two Condesa tacos are way too generous, while three truly street-sized tacos at Gallo Blanco are just perfect for this gal (one reviewer noted the lack of a \"sampler\" style plate, which is True). However my brother in law, the bottomless pit, packed away one queso and two tacos in a single sitting. So if you're a big eater and looking for value, its very fair and you'll get plenty of protein.  THE BEANS Smooth, smoky, with just a little chunk. Thin enough for dipping, which is crucial for the doughy ends of your fried queso tortilla. I'm impressed at how consistent the beans have tasted across three visits. Portion size has been reviewed as small but when you have that much taco to eat, who has room for beans other than as a condimento?  THE RICE Nothing to write home about. Pale, underseasoned. On one visit it was sticky. Not what we local eaters expect as \"Mexican Rice\".  THE SALSAS This is what you come for: salsa on demand. There is an avocado cruda salsa that disappears quickly but is consistently green and fresh, never gray. Chile de arbol salsa has a faint nutty taste. Green tomatillo is delicious. Purple cabbagy condimento is great paired with cochinita as suggested. Salsa Mexicana is not mundane. Cilantro drizzle is a welcome accent.   TACOS Taco plates are generously portioned with meat, almost too much in my book but who's complaining? Whisper of selected vegetable garnish included. Tortillas are average quality and may not be steam-fluffed enough. I'll give them this: they don't break.   BURRITOS Messy but good. Thin wax paper can't withstand much contact with a knife and fork. The Bullet is a mild no-brainer favorite for kids.   QUESOS Decadent! Sinful! Beckoning! The fried dough is pastry-like. Paired with the cohinita pibil it was like having dessert for supper. The extra doughy bits on the seam are particularly yummy dunked in beans. Being a fan of the doughy huarache concept in general, the Queso takes corncake-ness up to eleven.  MOLE NEGRO A True mole negro, not the sweeter raisin-y ancho-packed type we often get here in town. It's not smoky, but actually charred and a little bitter, with aromatic undertones. Chocolate tones not easily discernable. Different that what you may be used to, but good.  AZTEC CHICKEN TINGA Adequately wet and seasoned. Tender and easy to pull apart without a knife. Mild on the seasoning, but easily remedied with that ample salsa bar everyone is raving about. This makes Mexican food accessible to all tolerances of heat, in a way.  COHINITA PIBIL Delicate shreds of well braised pork. Low key on the seasoning but not flavorless. Nice paired with the purple salsa and anything acidic they have out that day.  SEAFOOD Our bottomless pit had the Ahi and the Dogfish shark and said both were good.  CARNE ASADA Crunchy but missing the smoke and sizzle I'd expect from a mesquite grilled specialty. It was adequate but lacked a bit of citrus acidity and kick. Competent, and even tasty.  Again, nothing not easily remedied by salsa.  VEGETABLES How refreshing to have vegetables available for all dishes as entree or add-ons. I added spinach to my Queso in a meager attempt to satisfy a vegetable serving for my meal. It delivered beautifully and added crunch.  BEVERAGES Horchata and Jaimaica live up to their previous reviews here. Horchata is way too huge for a child. Would love to see a pint-sized version. The full size is a commitment.  THE WAIT Yes, you might wait. Even if the restaurant is empty. I went for take-out after the lunch rush and waited 20 minutes even though there was only one order ahead of me and there was no line at the counter.  If I had known they were going to pack me a mini-stash of chips in the to-go bag I'd have asked for it in advance to pass the time at the salsa bar while I waited. Post-lunch rush also showed some empty salsa bins but with 12 choices, it just means some of your favorites are in the process of being refilled. We're spoiled here at La Condesa. Most of my favorite True-mex restaurants only offer two, maybe three at the table.  THE ENVIRONMENT Rustic contemporary/ironic and clean on the surface but not tidy to the  glance when abandoned baskets stack up. They need a self-service trash can like Baja Fresh or Chipotle so the baskets don't accumulate in public view. Would appreciate a commitment to wash cheap silverware. No indication if they recycle the consumables.",

    "text": "Aargh - the two reasons I come are the two reasons I can't give this place what could be it's due worth.  I came specifically to try their salsas and their horchata.  Unfortunately I never really got to try either b/c they had run out pretty much out of all of it.  Probably a good sign that they are busy and popular but at the same time, a big disappointment.  I tried their two taco plate.  The cochinita pibil and veggie tacos.  Both were ok.  The beans were ok but not nearly as good as America's homemade beans.  The rice was like everyone said - not your typical mexican rice.  Not bad though.  Apparently they were so busy they could barely keep up with \"supply\".  The salsa bar was pretty dismal.  They had just a little of the cilantro and peanut one.  Horchata was all out.   I'm disappointed that I missed out but at least it's a good sign that they are the place to go.  Will definitely be back to hopefully try again.  TIP: If you are coming at night, be very careful.  It was really dark and there weren't any real lighted signs.  I could barely see it so it's easy to pass it.",

I remembered the amazing mosaic sculpture and told my buddy, let's try the place with the big Dia de los Muertos lady on the front....and we did.  The Mayan taco was ....well...to use the term orgasmic would be both an understatement and a poor use of the word.  I took my parents there 4 days later and had a similar experience. My dream dinner there is to have many friends, many hours, many many tacos, and many beers or margaritas.  I am impressed with the food quality, but haven't had the beans or rice, I figure why?  They have tacos.  Also, impressive salsa bar with a pink radish salsa that I wanted to drink out of the bowl.  Yes, this is a hedonistic review, but I had a hedonistic time.  Go eat here.  They must never go out of business.",

The Puebla Quesa is amazing with the cashew salsa from their crazy huge salsa bar.  Their homemade jamaica and horchata are great.  Honestly there's not a bad thing I can say about this place.",

The salsa bar is fantastic, and with so many choices (upwards around 10!) it was really hard to stick with four or five little cups.  I decided to go kind of random with my taco selections and picked the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco and the Cochinita Pibil - marinated pork.  I seriously think the Cochinita Pibil was the best taco I've ever had, at least north of the border anyway.  The Dogfish Shark taco was very good as well.  I think my search for the best tacos in Phoenix has come to a close!  It's going to be really tough to justify going to another place after this experience.",

    "text": "Oh. My. Goodness.  I realize that I just reviewed this little-slice-of-Heaven last week, but our latest visit deserves an update.    We brought my visiting mother-in-law to La Condesa, so we could share the Mexican-food love with her.  For the last two days, I've heard her on the phone to at least 3 different people, raving about the \"amazing\" Mexican food she had on Saturday.    On this visit, they had the Carne Asada (they were out last time).  My husband liked it, but actually thought the Tinga chicken was even better.  He swears there isn't a better chicken taco in town, and I think I'd have to agree.  My MIL had the chicken mole tacos and loved them.  She orders mole whenever she gets the chance, and rated it way up with Barrio's dish.  I was blown away by the deliciousness of the mahi-mahi burro.  Oh, goodness... I'm having a flashback of it's amazingness...  luscious chunks of fish, smokey bacon, mushrooms (which I normally pass on, but they were fantastic!), and their velvety cilantro-cream sauce.  Ahhhhh.... so good!    Another 5-star visit!",

This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the \"Grand Opening\" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!  It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!  As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.  All the paintings are great, love the artist.",

    "text": "I read about this place in New Times and saw two words that always speak to me like they are some alluring foreign language.... COCHINITA PIBIL! I've made this dish at home a couple of times, and it takes me a couple of days, so when I get to eat it it is a real treat.   Went into La Condesa around 7:30 on Thursday night and went straight to the counter and ordered the glorious achiote and orange maranated pig, along with rice and beans and a homemade horchata. Chips were included. While I was waiting for food, the people running the place were over the top nice. The man told me about some tips to making cochinita pibil including using cinnamon, which I'd never done. The girl actually introduced herself, shook my hand, and asked my name. I've never had anyone do that in a restaurant. She proceeded to explain the salsa bar, which had about a dozen different salsas though they plan to have 20 in total eventually.   The chips were fresh, all 5 of the salsas I tasted were delicoius, especially the green cream and the watermelon. My Horchata was amazing, just perfect. They topped it with crushed nuts, and there were strawberry chunks and whatnot in it. Very unique but amazing. My tacos came, and I was quick to pick off the raw onion and replace it with the proper pickled onion slices as it should have come in the first place. No problem, they have the pickled ones at the salsa bar along with all the other veggies. The tacos were full of meat bursting at the seams... large portions were great for me as I'm used to such small tacos. Their refried beans were creamy and well cooked with a nice cheese garnish, and the buttery smooth rice was delicious as well.   For the fact that this place is nice, decorated with dia de los muertos style art, mexican wrestling posters, the niceness of people, and the excellent food, this place gets five stars as easily as any restaurant I've been to in Arizona. It reminded me of Mama Testa, which has grown to be one of the best known taco shops in San Diego. Phoenix has never seen anything like this. They asked if I want to come back, and I assured them, it will be soon. Very soon.",

    "text": "te encontre!  I've been reading yelp reviews of this for a good two weeks and was dying to go here.  After a long day of not eating, I forced myself to go here. It's completely out of my way but boy was it worth it.  I ordered two things: Carne asada tacos combo plate and a Tinga quesadilla.  The fact that they have tinga makes me very happy. It wasn't as \"tingaish\" as I would have liked it, but then again, no one has ever made me tinga like my Tia guty.   The bad: - teeny tiny parking. I came here at 4pm on a friday and was the only person there for a good ten minutes. I can't imagine finding a parking spot when there are more people around.  - The tortillas weren't great. They're not bad, but they aren't anything special. A taco should have a good tortilla in case the meat sucks (not that it sucked here). - The rice and beans portion is small. WAY small. I get that a restaurant needs to make some profit, but these are tiny.   The good-  - The quesadilla is huge. By huge, I mean I ate half of it and had to save some for later because of how filling the doughy tortilla is. This is not your average quesadilla. Not only do they use the right cheese (not your Americanized mozzarella and monterey jack or even, god forbid, chihuahua cheese), but the tortilla is flaky AND flavorful. That's a quality tortilla. This tortilla is nothing like the one used for the tacos, you can tell they make these themselves.  -The variety of salsas is pretty damn good. They will have everything from the most unoffensively bland salsa for gueros to a chile de arbol salsa that could make my daddy sweat.   - La horchata. Now this is what horchata should taste like. Other restaurants take note because people may come here solely for this. The fruit is a cute side trick, but the horchata really is good.  I give it five stars because it reeks of unpretentiousness and we all know how much I loathe pretentiousness. The artwork is simple but quirkily Mexican, there is nothing fancy about the decor (which I like) and the cook looks like my Tio Memo (except he can cook whereas my Tio cannot).   Overall, I hope they don't change a damn thing here. Let it become as popular as they can but please, please, don't change what you have! Finally, some authentic (and I hate using that word) tacos in Phoenix.",

This was all done with a smile and kindness that is unfortunately rare these days.   Even just thinking about that taco... Grilled Mahi w/ a ton of veggies, spinach, onions,  wrapped in a homemade tortilla, guac, TONS of dipping sauces... literally melted in my mouth.

    "text": "If there is anything I'd miss if I were to leave Phoenix, it would have to be the Mexican food.  That's what we're good for (and to think we're trying to get rid of the Mexicans!).  There's awesome greasy hole-in-the-wall, everybody-speaks-Spanish places like El Tlacoyo and Moreno's in Mesa; there's a variety of fast food places like Filiberto's and Someburros; you have you generic family restaurant Mexican like Macayo's, Garcia's, and Tia Rosa's; and then you have your niche places.  La Condesa is one of those niche places, and one of my favorites.  Here, their niche is a slightly fancy take on really simple items like tacos, salsa, and quesadillas.    The tacos come in several varieties, with meats including chicken, beef, pork, whitefish, and even dogfish shark, and different spices and toppings on each one.  My favorites are, of course, the shark, as well as the black mole, and one of the beef ones (not the Sonoran).  The salsas are also a big draw: prepare to be blown away as you dip your chips in peanut salsa, strawberry salsa, cilantro salsa, or even my personal favorite, pecan salsa.  There are typically about 20 choices, so if you want to try them all, come with a few friends (it does get crowded, though).  The quesadillas are also delicious; they're a southern Mexican fried style.  They're quite heavy, so don't plan on being able to eat two or three tacos *and* a quesadilla.  Oh...and GET THE HORCHATA.  You won't regret it.  I won't describe it, just because I don't want to ruin the surprise.  But it will blow your mind.  Whenever I get it, which is always, someone always asks me what that delicious-looking beverage is.",

My first trip to La Condesa was great, the music is very authentic, almost like Latino pop. But the FOOD- lets talk about it... First you get chips and you wonder, where is the salsa lady?! But then you realize that amazing salsa bar at the back of the restaurant is where you get to pick out your salsa! My favorite was the strawberry salsa it was so unique, I've never had something like that before- and it was fresh fresh fresh! Then there's other usual salsas and more fun ones, probably about 12 or 14 to choose from and lots of lemons and limes.  I had the tinga chicken tacos and they were very spicy, but I like spicy! But if you don't like spicy do not order them, they have an after burn and don't require salsa. The amount of chicken on the two taco plate was amazing for $6.99!

We went in on a Thurs night and the extremely small restaurant was packed. There really is nowhere to stand if you're waiting for a table. The place is so tightly packed that you kind of awkwardly stand with your butt in a diners face while waiting for someone to seat you. There were only TWO people working the entire floor that night. From seating, to serving, to bartending. TWO PEOPLE. It was an extremely long, awkward wait and we kind of ended up seating ourselves at the bar once it cleared out because no one else offered us a seat anywhere. I felt bad for anyone who came in after us because they all had the same look of awkward confusion on their faces as they stood by the door for 20 minutes waiting for SOMEONE to let them know what to do, where to go.... We got margaritas, which weren't very strong- and we're extremely expensive ($8 ea???). And even though the service was the worst I've ever seen in my LIFE- the food completely made up for it. I wanted to hate the place, but my burrito was so good- I never wanted it to end. I got the La Santisima Specialties Burro with arrachera  . Heaven on a PLATE. So flavorful, filling, delicious....i'm like...daydreaming of it now....... The final bill was pretty pricey for only 2 burritos and 2 drinks- $50?? If I were to visit this location again (which I will)- I'd most likely just get my food to go. The inattentive lack of service makes you feel more like a bother than an appreciated customer.  *edit* Moved to Phoenix, been here twice since then. Food is still super amazing. I mean seriously...that La Santisima Specialties burro dipped in pecan \"salsa\".......to die for. Service hasn't changed. If it's busy, goooood luck. Your service will be horrendous. We went today and it was FINALLY slower...we actually got a table and not the bar stools for once. And we were served a lot faster...much more pleasant. Wish they'd expand. But whatever. Awesome place, just go.",

It features something for everyone!!! The salsa bar alone will have your taste buds wanting more!!!  The veggie quesadilla is to die for!!!! The fried touch they give to it adds something you can't get anyplace else. Oh and before you leave you have to try their Horchata!!! If you like Horchata then you haven't tasted anything like this one!!!! It could win awards, seriously!! I was a little nervous when I heard they add fruit and nuts to it, but then I tried it....it was gone in minutes!!!!  Anything you order here is going to be fabulous and fresh. You don't leave feeling heavy like when you eat Mexican food sometimes. I can't rave enough about this place!!! Try and enjoy!!!",

    "text": "This is one of those places that have lots of potential but are not managed well. My boyfriend's dad was in town and he wanted to have some authentic Mexican food and since we were starving we ended up coming to La Santisima since the reviews seemed good and it was closed to where we were.  When we got there the place was fairly busy, they only had 4 chairs in he waiting And my first impression of the place was not great. There was water spilled in the floor and food crumbs all over the place. Anyways, there were several people standing waiting to be acknowledged. When the host finally came she didn't greet us and we had to ask her if she wanted to take our name. We waited about 10 minutes for a table and then were seated in a booth.   The room where we were seated was decorated very nicely with paintings of \"La Santisima Muerte\" but none of the lights in the roof were working, so they had a light in the corner of the room that was very bright and poorly placed. We then met our waiter who was very nice but quiet (It seemed like he has whispering the whole time), we asked for a drink menu and guacamole and sadly we were told they didn't have any Guac. Anyways, at this point we were just \"meh\" about the place and we just ordered our food. I had carne asada tacos, my boyfriend had a mole burrito and his dad had a burrito as well. They brought our food and I had to ask for utensils since there were none at the table. My tacos were tasty, the beans and rice were well cooked and delicious. I asked for a lime (since I'm Mexican and I can't really eat my tacos without lime) and I never got it :( so I stole my boyfriend's lime from the margarita he ordered (without a drink menu by the way cause he was never given one) we finished our food, we payed and left.  Pros: Food seemed authentic and tasty. The artwork in the place is beautiful. The salsa bar is great.  Cons:  Poor customer service  The place looks like it needs better maintenance  NO GUAC?!   Customer advice:  This place has great potential. I think that if they had more waiters the customer service would improve since everything seems quite disorganized.  -Greet your clients when they come in. -Clean the floors constantly.  -Fix the lighting. -Go to the store and buy some Avocados for God's sake. -Have utensils at the table.  -Expand your waiting area.  Honestly, I'm a little bummed cause the food was good but I don't think I'll come back to this place.",

My table always has about 8 different little salsa cups all over it for all the different mixings and options.   Also, I've only ever eaten their tacos and there are two pages to choose from so I will probably continue as they are all completely different and unique.   The interior is comfy and really artsy. I love this spot!!",

My hubby and I came once, and decided to bring my parents here for an early Mother's Day lunch.    I go weak in the knees for restaurants with salsa bars, but this place has a salsa bar on steroids.  They cater to all tastes and all heat levels.  I am in love with at least 5 of their salsas, including the pico de gallo that is so lime-y and delicious that it's the first one that ran out during both of our lunch visits.    My hubby ordered the Norteno burrito both times and I got a variety of street tacos.  The carne asada is soft and juicy and not the least bit tough like you'll find at most Mexican places.  The beans remind me of the ones that my BFF's mom makes in Nogales.  Delicious!!",

The tacos were legit, the fish tacos were amazeballs, and the veggie options were ridiculous. I had a shrimp taco, and a veggie taco, both were outstanding. The fresh salsa bar was ridiculous too, in a good way :)  Go here, eat tacos, thank me later.  Note, lots of pescie and veggie options! #veggie4life #veggielife #pescielife",

Shark and shrimp tacos for the rest of the table and it all looked good with good comments.   This is a small place with only ten tables and a small bar. The service is quick despite obvious take out orders and a full dining room. Salsa is homemade and presented in Tupperware on an ice bar, with a ton of different choices.

After the manager had to threaten to call the cops she settled down and after the shakes and sweats stopped, we were able to enjoy the best damn tacos we have had in a loooong time.

    "text": "If you are looking for a hidden gem of Phoenix, La Santisima is definitely one of those places!!  The decor and vibe of the place is top notch. Even though it is a bit small, it has a bit feel on the inside. The decor is not over the top and for being a taco shop, has the ability to seem a bit classy.  The biggest thing that would sell anyone on this place is the salsa bar. Every type of salsa you can think of. Some ranging from really hot to super mild. Some specialty salsa as well made form guacamole, cashews, and fruit. You can definitely chow down a few baskets of tortilla chips trying all the different types of salsa.  I ordered the Azteca Tinga Burrito. It came out really quick and was huge. The burrito itself had an amazing flavor on its own, but I added some of their salsas to spice it up a bit and it made it even more amazing. The chicken was cooked very well and was very flavorful. Even the beans and veggies in the burrito had their own flavor to it.  I am looking forward to visiting this place more and more and trying as many different items on their menu as possible. Not to mention all the salsas!!",

Superb flavors and I greatly enjoyed the paintings by Manuel Gilavalos y Garcia and Ricardo Ramirez.   I finally had a chance to try horchata garnished with pecans, berries, cinnamon. I couldn't help but think about the tune by Vampire Weekend teehee  Baja Sur Dogfish Shark taco of corn tortilla stuffed with beer battered dogfish shark - nice and soft. Maria Sabina Quesadilla of Oaxaca cheese with sauteed wild mushroom melange - crunchy and cheesy yummy! I'm glad my friend took me here while I was visiting!",

Peanut, pecan and others were more like dressing than salsa. Pico was tasty too.  Tacos: Chicken Mole was great, sauce was not spicy, but this taco sticks to your ribs.               Carne Asada - had fatty pieces and chunks. Picked through this one.  Beans/Rice - Did enjoy the beans, free chips and rice wasn't really Mexican, but more white with veggies.   Horchata - Glorious beverage here. First horchata I had to use a spoon for to get all the fruit and nuts out from the murky cinnamon depths.  Price: Two tacos platter for almost $10. wanted crispy shells, but only corn here. Horchata is 4 bucks so price can be $20 for one person almost.",

Its a very small venue, no bathroom, so make sure to wash your hands and do your business before you get there. Only about a dozen or so tables on the floor, and the cashier is also your waitress delivering food to your table. If your expecting great service, forget about it, you focus strictly on the food here. Their is barely any parking. Everyone that seemed to come in was new to this place checking out other patrons food and asking them what it is and how they like it. Im sure they were all fellow yelpers as well considering where this place is and how everyone appeared to be new to this place.  The address is a little confusing with the map being shown on their website. Its off 16th street as the address implies, and the crossroad is Palm and 16th. There is a sign for another business there that says FAT PAD which is easily visible. Blink and you will miss this restaurant. The inside has a lot of cool mexican art. They also have a fresh salsa bar.  Wow this has some very flavorful food. Its not greasy or fatty at all. You can really taste all the ingrediants. I ordered the Dog Fish Tacos, the mahi mahi burrito, and the Carne Asada Taco. Everything was absolutely delish with lots of flavor! I liked the Dog Fish taco best.   Make sure to get there before noon. They do take a while to make it, so be sure you have the time, especially if they are busy. You can call ahead or fax your order in as well.",

The quality and size of their tacos surpasses that of America's (Sorry America's Taco Shop lovers) and it adds a strong local cultural vice that other taco shops lack with its Dia de los Muertos themed paintings. The meat is well-marinated (especially the carne asada) and the dozen-plus salsas are each different by tasty and made to perfection. You can spend ten-to-fifteen minutes just sorting through the salsa bar. I am lucky enough to live nearby and I take advantage of the shark tacos on most days :) I am so glad that it's caught on!

    "text": "I lived on the U.S.-Mexico border for a good portion of my life. Everybody claims to sell \"street tacos\" in the Southwest, especially AZ. After TWO years of looking for decent Norten~o Mexican food in the Phoenix area, I found La Santisima (formerly La Condesa). They have a wide range of salsas and condiments to add to your food. So check it out and try it. The salsa has heat and flavor that is lacking in 99% of \"Mexican food\" places around here. Be advised that it's a small place that specializes in tacos and burros and, at times, there's not enough room to sit. However, it's really worth the wait. I drive all the way from northeast Mesa/AJ to just have some of their fare. As far as the latter not so favorable review (9/6/2015) on here questioning authenticity, I don't understand how something isn't \"authentic,\" when northern Mexicans regularly use mayo and mustard, due to U.S. influence. Ever had a Sonoran hot dog? The menu does state that the owners are from the northern state of Sonora. Regardless of these types of reviews, La Santisima is a great place to go have some beer and tacos in a dark place reminiscent of a taqueria on the Mexican side of the border. Besides, where else can you see posters of \"El Santo\" movies in the men's restroom? If you've been watching \"The Strain\" on FX, this is the movie hero upon which the \"Silver Angel\" character is based. Without a doubt, wholeheartedly recommend this place for tacos and beer... btw, if you're looking for margaritas, the ones we had were far from \"watery.\"",

The whole place is decorated with Dia de los Muertos art everywhere -- very colorful and authentic.  Next...the meals.  So far I've had the shrimp burro and some of my co-workers chicken mole quesa.

    "text": "They have 3 items: tacos, corn quesa, and burritos.  They are all first rate!  They also have the best salsa bar with really creative salsas.  We've been here many times, tried almost the entire menu, and the food is always delicious.  The horchata and jamaica drinks are also a must!  Our only complaint is the noise level.  It's a small venue and they play the music loud enough that it interferes with having a conversation.",

    "text": "This place is a must!  I was craving good Mexican food and this definitely hit the spot.  The Horchata was TO DIE FOR!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the restaurant set up. We arrived around 12:45pm. When you walk in its crowded with tables, so you're scanning for an open seat to grab before ordering.  While I waited at the table my friend stood in line to order. After standing in line for 15 mins they told her at 1pm they change to serving the tables.  Eventually a waiter came and we received our food. While sitting there a group of 3 came in, waited in the doorway for a solid 5 mins.  They weren't acknowledged in any way; no direction on what to do. This was clearly their first time there as well. Another group of 2 comes in slides right by them as they were finally receiving instruction from the waiter and took the last table.  I would have been very irritated but they kindly left quietly and took their business elsewhere.",

    "text": "What makes this place special is the salsa bar like none other.  Some are good on the complimentary chips; others are good with your order.  It's up to you to find out.  The oversized paintings reminiscent of Kahlo and Rivera adorn the walls.  Frida and Diego also appear in the pictures, and, yes, we're on a first name basis.  The restaurant was just about empty when we entered on a Friday night.  Hopefully, this was because it is new.  Pssst, you're missing out.  I had fish tacos and my Frida had some vegetarian dish.  Both of us were very happy.  They didn't have margaritas, just beer.  But I keep trying to order a margarita every time I go for good measure.",
