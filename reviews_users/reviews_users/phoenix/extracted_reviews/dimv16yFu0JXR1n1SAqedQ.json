    "text": "Excellent food and huge portions. We had beef and lamb kabobs, and the Chicken Biryani (which was spicy), and Greek salad. Really impressive mix of complementary flavours and seasonings. We all had plenty to take home for at least another meal each. The zaatar is much thicker than I am used to, and just a little bland than the home made zaatar I'm used to. That's just a personal preference though.   We were finishing when the belly dancing performance began, which was fun to watch but quite loud.   The only loss of a star came from the service. While our server was attentive enough, she was indifferent most of the time, and had a few moments that seemed to be a combo of laziness and irritation (clearing plates, the process of collecting packaging for us to wrap up our leftovers). Also, despite the loud music when we had trouble hearing her, she only once moved so we could hear her better. The rest of the time we had to speak loudly up at her. This place is right near ASU, so their staff looks mostly like college kids, so no surprise she wasn't more friendly and engaging. Besides, it is a Friday night, maybe she was just annoyed at working instead of getting to go out.   Last, they do not have hookah, so there is none inside (yay!). But, people to rent them from a place in the same plaza and smoke on their patio, which is next to their front door and parking. So if the smoke bothers you be prepared to hold your breath for a minute on your way in and out.",

I got half cheese half zaatar manaqeesh which was fine, but if I knew that they brought bread and zaatar as a starter, I wouldn't have ordered it. Too much bread! Next time I'll get the fattoush salad, or falafel. I got a free hummus from checking in on Yelp, which is always a plus.   I've passed by this place so many times and it's funny that it took so long for me to stop in. Maybe it was the hookah place next door that deterred me since I thought it was in the same building. It's got a nice atmosphere, bigger than I thought with lots of seating. The night we went (Thursday) had a tango class going on, which was interesting. The owner was welcoming and our waitress was friendly and great at her job. It did take us some time to get our check. I'd like to come back and try their other menu items.",

Boy oh boy, was I ever happy when the kind man was at my door. I placed my order around 8:50 and they were here within the hour.   We had the shawarma and humus, the chicken skewer thingy off the grill, greek salad and the baklava.  Yea, this is a great delivery option for me. There's Naan too, or something of the sort.   This was one of the nights where I was pleasantly surprised and I hope it's just as good when I order again. I will try and call to place an order next time buuuut, based on the experience contacting them tonight I might not have luck going directly through them. I'd have given 5 stars as I usually do if they'd had someone answer their telephone.  Thank you Mijana for dinner this evening it was delicious!",

Then we went over to the hookah lounge owned by the same people and waited an hour to have our hookah. By that time I was tired and has a few puffs, before going home to bed. I didn't want to tell them this was my birthday dinner, but they should treat the customer like every day's your birthday.  Apparently some staff are on spring break, so they apologized for keeping us waiting so long at the hookah lounge, and offered me a free hookah next time. So I might give them a change again.",

Please note that you pay more for this than the other two places.   *Belly dancers are there on Fri. and Sat. starting at 7:30pm.   *Though it's a Lebanese restaurant, they do have a full bar.   I love the atmosphere at Mijana's. The portions are huge and had I known I would not have ordered two things. The lentil soup was warm, thick and creamy. It tasted gourmet to me. I've never had fattoush before and it was alright. Tastes somewhat like a Greek salad to me. They serve generous amounts of pita as a free appetizer and they give you sesame seed oil for dipping. Their Arabic coffee is not sweet like at Sahara but still good. We arrived when the waitress was on a lunch break and the manager offered us a place to sit and he would serve instead. For that, he's awesome.",

This was a first for me, trying Lebanese food. We had come in on a slower night and we sat where we wanted. The server took our drink orders. I opted for a Lebanese beer, Almaza that paired well with our meal. We ordered the humus and it was brought it with what looked like a pita however was slightly different, not really sure what its really called. This went well with the soup we asked for, one order of their version of chicken noodle and vegetable, and one of the lentil. All was great.  For the main course we had shish tawouk and paella. Both dishes we've had before and I was waiting to see how this place did the paella seeing as its traditionally thought of a Spanish dish. Some quick researched revealed that Spanish food historian Lourdes March notes that the dish \"symbolizes the union and heritage of two important cultures, the Roman, which gives us the utensil and the Arab which brought us the basic food of humanity for centuries.\" So now I know.  Enough history, and on to the food. The chicken kebabs were marinated perfectly and cooked with some awesome spices. The paella came with shrimp and mussels cooked with garlic, parsley and what I believe was saffron rice, all to perfection. An order of baklava finished off the meal. I've had better baklava in the past, however this wasn't bad at all. We will be back to try other dishes soon.",

The following are our observations:  1) Regarding the decor it is well done  2) The menu and fare does have a lot of Middle Eastern/Lebanese fare, but it is not as True to the Lebanese fare as my wife and I had hoped.    3) They had a few menu listings that were more \"Westernized\", as well as having some menu listings that were more South Asian (Indian/Pakistani) rather than Lebanese.  They had things like tilapia on the menu, as well as biriyani.  Tilapia is now farmed everywhere, but its origin is Malawi in Africa.  Biriyani is a rice and meat dish that originates from the Northern part of the Indian Subcontinent, and perhaps is Persian or Turkish origin if not Indian.  Even the way the biriyani was presented, it is quite different from what I remember eating in Delhi.  Regardless the food was good.  Just do not expect them to be like the traditional.  For the record the food that we ordered was the following:  1) Baba ghannouj (typical Lebanese) 2) a tilapia fish entree (a hybrid of Lebanese, and other things) 3) chicken biriyani (a hybrid of Lebanese, Indian, and other things)  All was good.  I have no problems with the quality.  Just do not expect the traditional Lebanese or Middle Eastern fare.  Lebanese fare is there and present, but there are things that are decidedly none Lebanese, or not only Lebanese.",

I looked at an empty glass of water numerous time, and when we asked about dessert the waitress told us that we could get up and go look at the display! Food was delicious though, I'll give the kitchen staff that much.  When it came time too pay, the waitress took the first bill along with the groupon, charged it and then proceeds to tell the rest of our party that she can only accept one Groupon per table. So, not only did I pay for the Groupon, I also paid for the full price of the meal!  The food might've been delicious, but it is not worth the terrible service.

    "text": "This review is for Mijana's lunch buffet. I would recommend this to anyone who would like try Lebanese cuisine and get an opportunity to try several dishes in one sitting. The dishes are well presented and I found most of them to be very good. I do wish, though, that they would have labels for the different dishes, like some buffets do, with perhaps a brief phrase describing what each dish is; for instance: \"Dolmades - vegetarian stuffed grape leaves.\"  Our group at the buffet UYE today  (Rand H., Mike C., Robyn N., and me) kept asking each other, \"What do you think this is? ... What's in here?\" because a lot of the dishes were unfamiliar, although they were really good. The service, while friendly, could be a bit more attentive. The restaurant is very spacious and seating is comfortable. Also, parking - which seems to be a problem in most other Mediterranean restaurants - is no problem here.",

We arrived just after they opened for dinner, so it was pretty empty except for a birthday party by the stage area.  The waitress was attentive and had drinks and food for us very quickly. I'm a freak about hummus and make my own pretty regularly, so I know what I like. The hummus here was absolutely wonderful; a good traditional creamy hummus.  The first batch of pita that came with it was nothing special, but the second batch was wonderful. It was hard to believe these came from the same kitchen, but I'm glad we asked for more.  My wife had the lamb shank dinner and I had the Kofta kebab, and we both agreed that our meat was delicious, but the rice was spectacular. The salad that came with the meal is always like garnish to me; good but nothing special and certainly not the star of the meal.  If I have the chance I may come back for the lunch buffet, but the dinner was great, even if a little expensive. For the lamb it seems appropriate, but kofta/kefta always seems like it should be cheaper than it is.  Hummus: 5/5 Pita: 4/5 (second serving was much better) Lamb shank dinner: 5/5  Kofta kebab: 5/5  Service: 5/5 Clean: 5/5",

It was as fresh as it gets we saw the bread coming out of the oven and delivered right to the table. Get the Lebne appetizer and use the zaatyr (spelling??) with the pita, it's heavenly!! I got the Greek salad with gyro meat I can't tell you how unbelievable it was!! Everything was perfect and the waitress was attentive and friendly.

The first half was great, the second not so much.  We got there early, around 5:45. There was only two other groups there and we were seated immediately. We planned to stick around for a couple hours to watch the show, so we tried a few appetizers. I have to say, it is hard to find a place that has good hummus and good falafel. It's usually one or the other. This place had the best I've ever had, and the pitas are delightfully fresh. We also had the baba ganoush, but that was not as blended as I usually like, there were still lots of seeds and it was a little slimy. Our first two rounds of Adios Amigos (adios motherf*ckers) were strong and yummy, just the way I like them.   Around 6:30 they started to get busier, as people were arriving for the show (second Sunday of the month is Bollywood style dancing). Another waitress came in but that was still only 2 servers for everyone. It took more that 20 minutes before we could flag down one of them so we could order our meals and another drink. The last drink, I'm pretty sure they made with double rum and no tequila. Blech! Once we got our food I was a little surprised because I didn't think stuffed zucchini would be a chilled dish. Turns out it's not, my food was just cold, and I don't mean room temp I mean fridge cold. She takes it make, microwaves it for about 30 seconds and brings it back.  My meal tasted like they took Uncle Ben's spanish rice and stuffed it in some zucchini. He had the beef shwarma, and said it was so-so.   The entertainment was great, and our waitress was very helpful before other people started showing up. We might go back another night for more appetizers and to see a show or we may try the lunch buffet.",

You dip you meat into the sauce and it gives it so much flavor.  We thought it was another type of hummus so it was just sitting there at first and then our waiter told us to eat it with our meat.  They also have a cooking class for sale on Groupon that I want to try eventually to get their recipe.  The Jalepeno Hummus was also a winner!",

When we do go, lunch or dinner at Mijana is always the highlight of our day! The Baba Ganouj  ( it's sorta like hummus but made with eggplant) is to die for. My favorite thing on the menu,  I swear I am not going to order it as an appetizer, but I always do. You can see staff baking the bread and when the basket of warm pita arrives with this delectable dip I eat it all-- every crumb. Then, of course, my meal arrives and I am already stuffed. Unfortunately, I did the same last week. I was able to eat half my beef kabob plate. The meat was-melt-in-your-mouth tender. The rice was perfection. I loved the salad with a light lemony dressing. My husband ate part of his chicken and we brought the remainder home (along with an extra order of the Baba Ganouj). Even the remaining salad was good the next day. Pig that I am, I put the Baba Ganouj on an English muffin for breakfast, had it on pita with the meal leftovers for lunch and finished it with dinner. Yes, I did use a spoon to get the last tiny bit out of the container! We have always had great service and (Kathy?) took excellent care of us on this occasion. i just wish this place was closer to home.",

    "text": "My husband and I visit this restaurant very frequently, and last night was an exceptionally bad experience. You can see my previous five star review below. The plate that we always share, was at least one third smaller than usual, with less rice, less salad, and half as much chicken. The waitress, Loni, was blunt in speech and didn't appear to know how to speak to a customer or resolve any issues. My husband found a long black hair in his mouth, after taking a bite of rice, and when mentioned to Loni, instead of saying sorry she instead asked 'where?' We hadn't asked for a discount or a comp, we just wanted to bring it to her attention. We have ALWAYS had a great experience at Mijana. This time, it felt like all of the newer, under trained employees were running the show and doing a very VERY poor job at it.   ---previous review---I cannot even believe how delicious this food was! I stumbled across this restaurant on Groupon, wandered in, expecting some sub par Persian and got a five star meal! This food, even being thirty minutes til closing, was FRESH, FLAVORFUL, and absolutely mouthwateringly good. The waitress, Lina, was sweet and professional, as well as informative about the restaurant even though she had only been employees there for a few months. She was a spectacular staff member. Mijana has gotten two new lifelong diners. Very impressed! -on a side note, I got the mixed grill for one and was served tender, juicy kabob meat and kofta with rice and salad. The pita was also freshly made and piping hot and fluffy. PERFECT!",

    "text": "So at first when I was eating the zahtar and made in house pita, I was wondering how does this place only have a 3.5???  Well after the whole meal I know why.  The zahtar and pita bread are amazing. Honestly why I decided to come back after trying this place almost a year ago. It's complementary, so it's even better. You get this amazing home made bread and zahtar, for free.   We started with the Kibbe and cheese Borek. The kibbe was good, not my taste, but I recognize it was good and tasted like it should. The cheese borek had gotten a little cold so it wasn't as enjoyable. It was like eating a Luke warm, stiff feta cheese stick.  I got the chicken shrawma wrap, and my partner got the falafel. The shwarma was good nice flavor. But the pita wrap was dripping with sauce so it was very soggy, and messy to eat. The falafel was not crispy on the outside,so it was like a bean paste almost.  But the worst part was waiting 35 minutes for the check. We weren't checked on in that time. We had our plates stacked and napkins on top of them. It got irritating trying to get the attention of the waiter.  Over all, the zahtar was the saving grace and why I wasn't too dissatisfied.",

The food came out quickly, portions were generous, and I had an Almaza beer for the first time in a really long time.  The only problem was that my fork and knife needed to be wiped down and the glass that came with the beer wasn't clean.  I'm guessing the dishwasher isn't working right and I hope they fix it soon.  The ambiance is really interesting, the space is very industrial and edgy with the unfinished ceiling and color changing lights scattered around the room.  Thinking back on it, it was pretty cool.  I'd definitely come back here and I could see Mijana becoming a regular part of a \"last night in Phoenix/Tempe\" ritual, especially if they get the dishwasher working better.",

There was one girl serving (and bar tending) while a bunch of men played backgammon in the corner.  LOL.  There were 6 of us including my 9 year old daughter.  We ordered a magnum mixed grill along with a couple of other dishes to supplement the meal.  In the end, I think we have food for at least 10 people.  Everything was delicious.  The meats were more done to my liking, but still good.  The bread is phenomenal.  I would have stuff my face with several pieces, but I was saving my appetite.  I understand there is belly dancing (on the weekends?).  Maybe next time we're in town, we'll check out the entertainment.",

We had the amazingly most Lamb Shank that came with rice and veggies (enough for two to share). They give good portions here. And we ordered the Lebanese Tradition plate which has hummus, babaganosh and tabbuleh all good with pita bread provided. The belly dancer was amazing. She danced around and was authentic and tasteful for the whole family. My daughter loved watching the performance. Place seemed clean and food was tasty. Will try again for sure. With deal only ended up paying $35 for food, drinks and desserts. *Friday nights they have open dance and salsa music.",

He helped us order and we got quite the spread - Beirut Special, Vegetarian Platter, Kofta kebabs, lamb shank, and makanek.  I've never liked babaghanouj before I had it at Mijana.  It was so, so, so good!  Tabbouleh was also great and pita bread with zatar was also good.   The food was fantastic, but the service left much to be desired.  The lamb shank and kebabs came out lightening fast - making me concerned about the kitchen and how prepared it was before we ordered it.  Then it was a good 15 minutes before the rest of the food came out.  We had to ask twice for the pita bread, and my water was empty more often than full.  The waitress had a \"greater than tho\" attitude and was not very friendly.    They often have live entertainment and/or dances,  Last Saturday was no exception, but the gal that danced when we first got there wasn't great.    If I could, I'd give 2 stars for service and 4 for food.  Hurray for authentic Lebanese food and an ethnic experience in what can be a rather dull and homogenic restaurant scene.",

I have been twice, once with a large group and once it was just me and my woman.   The service: When I came with the large group the food service was poor as plates came out at various times with about an hour gap amongst people who ordered at the same time. When it was just two of us, everything as ok.  The food:  Have had two vegetarian plates the moussaka and the couscous and both were overpriced for the quality of the food. Vegetables were definitely out of a can and was something I could have made at home for about $1.50, which is unacceptable for a 12 dollar veggie meal. It is not that expensive to grill up some fresh vegetables and increases the quality of the meal substantially. Also had the lentil soup, which was tasty and not bad for $5, but it might have been from a can as well, just harder to tell with a soup.. You are likely not going to get what you pay for in food quality but the atmosphere is nice. If you are looking for some good flavorful ethnic food try GOJO Ethiopian on Thomas, you will not be disappointed.",

We ordered the lebanese trio, grape leaves, kibbe, bourak, soujouk, and chicken tawook. Everything was delicious, we had also ordered a lemon and mint argileh that tasted good and didnt burn right away like most argilehs tend to do. As a matter of fact the argileh didn't burn at all!

He made food recommendations & accommodated our vegetarian guests by making special dishes not on the menu. Then the day of party, he called early in the day to confirm the order. His son, Trevor, arrived on time and delivered all the food. He set everything on the table. The food was brought in foil pans, so he left some serving platters in case we wanted to use them instead of the pans. He also included serving spoons & tongs. Trevor was so professional & made sure everything was exactly as I wanted before leaving.  Our guests kept asking where we ordered from. Everyone absolutely loved the food!!! They were so excited to know we have a restaurant in town that makes authentic middle eastern food. Lots of our guests went back for seconds and we still had enough leftovers to feed another 50 people! Manesa is very generous with his portions. Mijana is definitely my #1 goto from now on!! Thanks Manesa & Trevor!",

The hummus and tabouleh were very tasty.  Gyro w/ Fries - $7, Good, not amazing. Beet and Lentil Salad - $11, very good.  Lots of lentils, tasty dressing.  Moussaka - $10, good, very filling. Stuffed Zuchinni - $10, very good.  Perfect flavoring, simple, hints of lemon.  Groupon $20 for $10 made this priced right, otherwise it would've been a bit much.    Women's restroom is very clean and pretty with candles and decorations.  There was SO much food.  I had to dig deep to try to make it look respectable, mostly from the appetizer, it just never ended.  We were the only ones in the restaurant the entire time.  It made for excellent service.  Server was very nice and professional despite the emptiness.",

    "text": "My first dinner experience with Mijana was not the best and I probably won't be going back to try any other dishes.   When I walked in, the place had an odd mild chemical smell that I couldn't recognize. Not bad enough to make me leave, but it definitely didn't smell appetizing. My server brought me ice water and complimentary pita bread with zaatar.  I ordered the lamb kabob which came with rice, a small side salad, several pickle spears, and some yogurt. My disappointment began with the salad, which consisted of tomatoes, cucumbers, and romaine lettuce.The tomatoes in the salad had a slightly mushy texture, like they'd been refrigerated for too long. There is no excuse for mushy tomatoes ever, but especially during the summer months. I tried the rice which was saffron colored and decorated with a few strands of chopped noodles. The rice was unremarkable and tasted like it had been parboiled. The lamb had flavor, but was extremely tough. Even after cutting the lamb into tiny pieces, it was embarrassingly difficult to chew.   My bill came to $17 and change. I gave my waitress $20, and she never brought me my change. To be fair, she might have brought my change at some point, but it was clearly not her priority as she ran around doing other things.   No complaints about the belly dancer.",

I may just convert to Islam if all of their food is as good as Mijana's take on Lebanese! jk jk  In all reality, my husband and I were sufficiently pleased with our order and will definitely be ordering from them again!  ORDER:  Chicken Shawarma Platter: 5/5 - Hubby ordered this and hoooooly God er... Allah, this... This was fantastic. I stole a bit off his plate in order to satisfy my curiosity because I'm a Shawarma nut and am trying to find awesome shawarma to lure my Israeli friend out to the desert from New York with. This might just do it. There's definitely a bit of a kick with it and it's sincerely tasty. Hubby was extremely happy  Lentil Soup: 3/5 - Arrived cold and was a little on the bland side. Nothing a microwave and salt couldn't fix Love the cheese in it. Very interesting.  Greek Salad: 5/5 - YUUUUUUM!!! They LOADED it with feta and tons of dressing and a huge amount of veggies. They definitely didn't skimp on their salad unlike most places!   Kofta Kebab: 4/5 - This is something I've never tried before. Anywhere.... But I seriously appreciated the spice notes and juiciness of this grilled treat. It went GREAT with the sauce and the rice... Lord have mercy I may need to trade in my southern roots for more of this lemon spice rice.   Baklava: 5/5 - So amazing. Love the tons of crushed pistachios on this AND these were FREE!!!  Pitas: 5/5 - Woooow open them up for a perfect pocket to stuff your noms in.  Service: 5/5 - Super fast and the driver as a real doll.   All in all? 5/5 and I WILL be going back!",

When I was ready to eat it, I opened the carton and it had dressing on it and all the pita chips soaked up dressing. Also, the tomatoes in it tasted old. I threw them out.  Mixed shawarma was not like I'm used to. I had a couple bites and put it down. Not good in my opinion. The saffron rice was fair.  Hummus had too much tahini and wasn't lemony at all. It tasted pasty.   Even though I was hungry, I threw most of it out.   I am middle eastern and hear my friends say how good it is there. I didn't think so.",

However, that wasn't the main meal. The beef was pretty dry along with the dry bed of rice.  Needless to say, I needed some water!  I must give them kudos for the sangria. It looked pretty cloudy at first, but when you take the first sip....oh yeah it's good!   Service is pretty good and and fast.  I appreciate the belly dancing show and the floor turns into a salsa dancing fest during the evening.  I've danced here many times and it's pretty good since there's actually room for you to move around.  However, ventilation is rough....sweat! - Enjoy",

    "text": "Had a Groupon and decided it was time to use it before it expired.  Besides, the hubs and I had just returned from vacay and looking forward to some mid-Eastern comfort food.  We arrived about 6 pm on  a Friday night and the place was pretty much empty. Too early for belly-dancing so not many customers but it did fill up a bit by the time we left.   Service - okay, you know that is always a beef with me. Bad food is attributable to a bad night for the chef but bad service is management not taking time to educate their staff.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't good. It was just kind of okay. We did watch our meals get set down at another table but they never touched them so it was easy to get them back.  We started with an order of Borek. I have always had it made pie-style but this was rolled cigar-style.  Very hot and fresh, nice mixed, crispy, not oily. I never had a mix of mozzarella and feta but it was tasty. Four to an order for $7.95.  A bit pricey I think, especially with them being cut with mozzarella.  They bring you an order of fresh bread with za-atar mixed with olive oil.  I enjoy za-atar on cheesy pita or on yogurt, but this just didn't do anything for me. On top of it, while the bread was freshly baked, it was very flat in flavor, as though they left the salt out.  Dinners come with side salad and rice.  DH ordered Chicken Shawarma and I order Lamb Kebab.  Start with salad. It is a simple salad (lettuce, cukes, tomatoes) with a dressing and a side of turnips and pickles.  Nice size for a side salad. It wasn't a bad salad although I would have liked to have some of the dry za-atar mixed into the dressing to add a little pizazz to it.  But here is the thing that really got to me. I am ordering an $18 dinner.  Please bring my salad out on a separate plate so it is cold and doesn't have hot meat and rice warming it up.  I get that it fills the plate up but, seriously, I now either need to eat my salad first (which I did so everything else was cold till I got to it) or eat the hot stuff first and let it wilt more. Dilemma, dilemma. DH tried to eat them at the same time and wound up with everything just lukewarm - salad, rice, and meat.  His Chicken Shawarma was nicely spiced and piled on top of the rice.  Good size portion.  The lamb perhaps was not so spectacular. I am not sure why mid-Eastern restaurants in Phoenix insist on cooking lamb till it is well done, no matter what you ask for but they do. They insist they cannot serve it any other way - and yet they offer raw kibbee.  Go figure.  Anyway, it was spiced with allspice as expected - a little different from what I am used to from other Lebanese restaurants.  Honestly - it was dry and tough.  If they used a shoulder, it might be a little tougher so maybe they didn't use leg of lamb.  would be a shame to waste a leg by overcooking it.  The last part of the meal was the rice. Every mid-Eastern restaurant has its own trademark rice - chicken broth, pignolia nuts, almonds,  raisins, maybe some herbs, maybe plain rice or maybe basmati, etc.  I can only liken this rice to Rice-a-Roni without the spice packet. There was no discernible flavor. No spice. It was just yellow.  That's all i can say about it, it was not remarkable at all.  Borek, two dinners, and two sodas - $48 plus tip before Groupon.  All in all, it was okay. I think that I have found more flavorful alternatives here in the Valley - although they do have a larger menu than many places.",

    "text": "Pretty good Mediterranean fare. I had beef shawarma atop hummus, and my tablemates all had other varieties of shawarma with the rice deal. It was fine, not too burnt like is often found at places that serve the stuff. The house-made pita was nice, and we had their take on samosas (beef filled mini-pies) which were called something else but same thing; pretty tasty.  The atmosphere was nice and fitting, given the theme. Middle Eastern-style music, upholstery, et cetera. The only off-putting things that stop me from giving this place 4 stars are 1) the bathroom, which was composed of all very-old elements (toilet, sink) and was pretty gross. It's an old building, I understand, but y'know. Other thing was we were seated at a table which was directly next to an exit door. Pretty sure that's a fire hazard. My final gripe for this otherwise-okay place: They brought out my food by itself and thus my tablemates had to wait. This should be a cardinal sin in restaurants; if you had seen any of my other reviews, you'd know how annoying I find it as it's pretty unnecessary. I'll save you the rant, but just say if you start a restaurant please refrain from allowing that mess.  Other than that, all was fine. I guess I wouldn't recommend going here if you want to avoid the Scottsdale (read: hoity toity) crowd, as they're all up in this place, but they were at least drowned out by the music.",

Food was delicious and came out in a timely manner.  Hummas was smooth and the pita bread was hot and puffy! Beef schwarma was incredible!!  We bought Baklava and another dessert to go. The other dessert has 4 cheese layers and a sweet syrup on top. Very good but burnt on the top.  Only 4 stars because there was no belly dancing as stated on their website. Manager and waitress could not explain why either.  We will be coming back and hopefully get to experience the belly dancing.",

Not sue what they are doing with that.  The Shwarma is very good even though they don't cook it on a spit. Which all Shwarma should be cooked on. Oh well.  I didn't like that kids were allowed in the Hookah lounge area just because it was the owners sons birthday. Tons of smoke in there and children shouldn't be in a Hookah lounge at 12am on a Friday night.",

From the stage, it appears there is live entertainment some nights although not much was going on the night I visited. It was quiet and easy to have a conversation.  Definitely ask for the \"pillowy\" bread--it's delish. It's a little pricey but they offer Groupons from time to time.  Just make sure you buy the correct one (lunch or dinner), as they strictly enforce this.   The food is very mellow on spices and features a lot of saffron and humus, grilled kabobs, yogurt sauces, etc.",

We would try to catch our waiter to ask for more water but it took forever. The waiters and waitresses seemed more entertained by each other and the lip sync battle that was taking place later in the evening than us. Food seemed old as in cooked a few days ago and reheated day of. Everything was dry, bland, and overpriced. The entertainment was something we were not expecting. Two singers came to the stage and honestly it was really hard not to laugh. They were horrible and it was just awkward because everyone in the restaurant was holding back laughter to be polite. At one point the music was so loud it woke up my sleeping baby cousin. Also we waited over an hour for bingo and they never started it. I will never come back here again and I recommend none of you to try either. Honestly I would recommend getting this restaurant on the kitchen nightmares show with Gordon Ramsey.   -an honest but very disappointed customer :(",

    "text": "I have been to this place multiple times both during the week and the weekends, but last night was the epitome of a failure! First of all, as a Middle Easterner I am embarrassed to see how terrible the food and hookah is at this place so if this is your first time trying this place you should definitely give other middle eastern restaurants a try before you rate middle eastern food in general. Last night me and a few other friends sat inside and I guess there is a $10 per person charge for Saturday nights since they have Arabic music and belly dancers. I have no problem with a charge but the belly dancer came for literally two songs and left. The singers and the bands that perform on Saturday nights are good and they keep the party going so overall I don't have a problem with the $10 charge, although it would've been nice to have the dancers perform more than two songs.   Now in regards to their food and hookah. I've eaten there multiple times and their beef and chicken kababs are not good but their Falafel and Humus are edible. Last night we just wanted to smoke hookah and order some appetizers. I ordered the Fattoush salad which has toasted pita bread in the salad. The toasted pita bread was so stale that I couldn't even bite on it. I asked the server about it and she said the chef had made the bread last night, 100% a lie. She did take it back and we got a Tiramisu instead. Their Tiramisu was frozen and god knows how many months it had been in the freezer. We couldn't even cut it with our fork. Their hookahs were so bad! A few minutes after smoking it, the hookah started to burn.  Also it didn't taste anything like the flavor we ordered. They probably recycle their tobacco each time a customer finishes smoking their hookah and put it back for a new order of hookah. And we asked multiple times for the servers to come replace the charcoal. I know my hookah and flavors and they should not charge that high of a price if they give you fake hookah and not even refill the charcoal every 20-30 minutes.   Last night was just a disgrace to any hookah bars and middle eastern restaurant. I just wouldn't recommend this place. I was so miserable last night and if it wasn't for my friends being there I would've addressed my concerns to the owner directly. I am sure the owner doesn't care because there aren't many places in the Phoenix area who have this type of entertainment to so people have no choice but to just pay. It is sad to see how bad this middle eastern restaurant was. So if you go to this place you should not expect anything decent, not the service, food or the hookah. Maybe just the music.",

And I met the owner I believe.he came up to me after I walked inside from the patio where I was vaping along with other people that were smoking and told me I couldn't smoke my vape inside.

Portions r big enough to share.  Going by the menu description I was really looking forward to try their vegetarian pilov with mushrooms cauliflower and eggplants but I was disappointed it was an ok dish but it wasn't a pilov. It was fried eggplant with steamed cauliflower and CANED mushrooms ( not even fried just straight from the can) topped with marinara sauces on plain rice. Disappointed .  Babaganush on the other hand was very tasty I really enjoyed it.  Red sangria was good,  we got one big one to share.  Service was a bit messy and slow, but it was a lot of people and 2 big birthday parties at the same time.  I would definitely come back to try some other vegetarian dishes. They also have a belly dancer show which we enjoyed, and after 9 pm they had salsa dance classes  So all over it was a nice place to visit with a small bumps now and then. I would recommend to try it and see for ur self.",

Some of the beef chunks were quite tough and he brought us out another rollup in its place, so tender and quite delicious.  The salad was great and the rice had a nice Saffron taste to it.  Their pita bread is excellent when it comes out straight from the oven with thier salad dipping dish.    All in all this was a fantastic place to eat. WE were too early for the Belly Dancing so we went out to Goodwill and came back and the server knew we wanted to see the Belly Dancers and walked us straight up to a very close table.

I never felt so embarrassed I had to flag down my server and she went ahead and spoke with the owner who happened to be there and on his way out. He comped our food and I was in disbelief. Best Lebanese food in Arizona and I recommend it to anyone. It's a restaurant at day and in the evening it turns into a nightclub. They also offer food classes so you may learn how to cook authentic Lebanese food. If you have not been there please stop in and try them out you won't regret it.",

The chicken shawarma was stale, and the garlic dip had no hint of garlic in it. Truly depressing, and I looked like a fool talking so highly about this place.

As I ordered delivery and had to spend quite a bit to cover the minimum amount for delivery I also bought the Mixed grill.  I intended to eat half of each but I devoured the quail so quickly I ended up only sampling the kebab just so I'd know how it tasted (Saved it for the next day, but kebab is never as good the next day) and it was equally amazing.  The lamb tasted just a tad tough, but it could have just been because it had time to cool during the delivery.  Will definitely order again, however maybe next time I'll dine in.  This kind of food really does need to be eaten fresh off the grill.",

It took us 15 minutes to get our drinks and when I needed a refill, I had to go to the bar and get it myself.  The man told me that he was busy!  He was watching TV!!!!!  One hour later - we FINALLY get our food and my husband's lamb was cold in the center.  It was obviously microwaved and not long enough to heat the center.   The pita bread had raw dough in the center and my meal was just OK.  A bellydancer asked me how my meal was and I told her that we were a little disappointed.  She went and got the owner, who would not even let me explain why we were unhappy - all he heard was \"my husband's lamb is cold\" and he cut me off and ran off with his plate and brought back the same plate - microwaved more.  He needs to learn to listen to the customer, especially when they have a valid complaint.  It was a total waste of time and money.  It took us over 2 hours to get out of there and the place was almost empty.    Mijana has become our family's inside joke. When we are hungry, we say \"how about Mijana?\" and we all start laughing.    There are much better middle-eastern restaurants in the valley and we will never be back to Mijana.",

Over the past year I've made a conscious effort to try independent, local businesses with greater frequency, and I've come across some real treasures.  Mijana is a shining example of this.  I've been to Mijana several times, and it's because of a combination of service and taste.  The very first time I came in was on a Sunday afternoon, and I hadn't the foggiest idea of many of the items I was trying.  The waitress actually took me up to the buffet after my lunch, and walked me through everything I had just tried.  I enjoyed everything but the baba ghanouj, and that was an issue of texture rather than taste- I've never cared much for eggplant anyways.  Honestly, I've never tried anything but the buffet, and part of that is because I have a huge appetite.  It's not a 50-dish ensemble, but man, the 20 or so items on there are swell.  The pita bread is made on-site, and quite frankly is the best I've ever had- light, fluffy, and warm.  I plan on dining here many more times in the future, as I just genuinely enjoy it so much.",

Any doubt I had I am kicking myself for.  First, the atmosphere is wonderful and our server was super friendly as were the other employees we encountered when we were leaving.  We ordered the beirut mezza, a beef kabob and a kofta kabob.  Again, cannot wait for leftovers tonight - the beirut mezza was a great sample of wonderful, flavorful items; the babaghonouj was the standout if I had to pick an item off of the plate. AMAZING. The kabobs were wonderful and served with a side of rice that was prefect as it wasn't overly seasoned and a fresh salad of cucumbers and tomatoes.  Again, wonderful.  As we were eating we were planning our next visit and decided we definitely need to bring a group of friends, the amount of food you get (and for a great price) is great for sharing with a table so you can sample different things.  Mijana is now on our go-to list for dinners out.",

    "text": "I just returned from my second visit to this exotic Middle Eastern paradise in good old North Tempe. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed, but I was thrilled.  I was reluctant to visit despite its location right across the street from me. What finally won me over is that I attended an Eastern Catholic event in Phoenix and met a Maronite priest from St. Joseph. In perusing an anniversary celebration program, I noticed Mijana had catered and I asked him if the owners were Maronite too. It turned out that some of the owners/employees were standing right there and they invited me to a party that week. Well, I didn't go to the party but I resolved to try them out, as I am Roman Catholic and I like giving business to fellow Catholics.  The most important thing to know about Mijana is that it is an unmitigated BARGAIN. Now this is not the cheapest restaurant in town, but considering what I have paid, I have come away stuffed and very satisfied. The first time around I dropped $25 or so, but honestly $10 of that was a chick drink that I just had to try - Pomegranate Mojito. Nothing bad against chick drinks, I am a fan. It was delish. I love pomegranate in any form and this was excellent. My \"entree\" (I'm on a portion control diet) was Quail Mezza. The quail was well-roasted and pretty good for quail. It was served with hummus, and on the waitress's suggestion I also got a cup of tomato and cucumber to mix in. I enjoyed it greatly. To round out my meal and really rack up the calories, they serve complimentary freshly-baked puffy pita bread, which comes piping hot and has this great dip of zaatar, which you have to taste to believe. It's green and oily and drippy and contains sesame seeds and exotic spices. It makes the pita so excellent and savory, irresistible.  The second visit I tried some different stuff. The menu is huge, especially the bar drinks, and so you could visit for months without repeating a dish. This time around I was served by a sweet girl who seemed a little rushed, considering that she was serving three tables in an otherwise empty space. The owner helped out some and I found the service very prompt and attentive. First I ordered a Virgin Pistachio Shake. This is $6 and came out huge with a mound of whipped cream on top. This is when I decided that Mijana = BARGAIN. I love pistachio anything, and this shake was creamy and delicious and altogether more calories than I should've had in one go. But no regrets! My \"entree\" this time was another appetizer, the Sambuska mezza. These are pastries with seasoned ground beef served on a bed of lettuce and with a tzatziki style dip. I was not so impressed with the pastry shell, but the meat was savory and had some nice pine nuts in it. Tzatziki covers a multitude of sins, anyway. And of course I had more of the beloved fresh puffy complimentary pita to round out my meal.  After I ate, I quizzed the waitress a little bit on the dancing available, because for a year now I have been an avid ballroom and Latin dancer. They have Tango on Thursdays and Salsa on Friday nights. A nominal cover charge gets you in, gets you a lesson, and gets you hours of social dancing. When I live right across the street, what could be better?  I still need to explore their menu some to find my all-time favorite dish. I may have to depart from the Mezza offerings and try a dinner sometime, or better yet, go for lunch when the prices are lower. I wouldn't mind trying the lamb shank or other exotic type of meat dish. With drinks and free pita like this, no meal can be a disappointment. And I haven't mentioned the ambiance. It is mysterious and exotic and intimate. There is Lebanese pop playing on the PA, low colored mood lighting and a cozy, family atmosphere here. You really get your money's worth. So come out and try it today!",

I do think $16 for a gyro plate, that consisted of half a plate of rice, lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, some slices of beet,1/8 of a pickle, and six slices of gyro meat is too much. I've had more fulfilling meals at George's Gyros - for half the cost.   Skip this place and head north to the Persian Room. More of a drive, but a far better experience for about the same money.",

    "text": "Unfortunately this was one of the worst dining experiences I have had in a long time. Maybe if the food was outstanding I would overlook the horrific service and go back, but that wasn't the case here.  We were promptly seated in a two top table in between two others. The tables were so close together it was difficult to sit down and all guests could hear the intimate conversations everyone was having. There was a huge SPOTLIGHT on us and it was making us hot - when we asked the waiter to please dim the light or turn it away from us, he shrugged and said he would see what he could do, but nothing was done.   15 minutes go by without a followup. No water, no how do you do. Meanwhile a large party of people (obviously friends of the owners) were escorted past us into a secluded area from which spicy aromas wafted, teasing us as we sweat into our hummus, which had inexplicabley arrived.  Hummus was tasty, oily, could use more salt... The pillowy warm pita it came with was nice and chewy.  All this, and no water or drinks yet!  Honestly I can't remember what we ordered, most likely a combo dish, it was so unmemorable. What I do remember is that our appetizer came out after our entree, and the poor waiter seemed frazzled because he had too many tables assigned to him.   The owners/management didn't seem to care.  We would've felt sorry for the waiter and left him more than a 10% tip of he had done something about the Interrogation lighting and if he had bothered to ask us if we wanted drinks, or even silverware (I had to borrow from adjacent table).  This place seems more like a place for the owners and their family and friends to hang out than a place to go if you want quality service.    Nope.",

I had take out once and it was good, but I highly recommend dining in if you are going to eat here. They serve fresh pita the entire time you are there! I think it's worth it, but a little too pricey for me to enjoy frequently.",

    "text": "I have been eating alone at Mijana for 20 years, since coming to Arizona, but ONLY with Entertainment (20 years ago, no longer buy them), Living Social, or other 50% off vouchers, which the owner is participant of many.     Most recently, I bought vouchers supposed to be used for lunch only.  Says you can purchase up to 10, so I bought 8, just for myself, because I like lamb.   In May, 2016, I told the waiter what I wanted to order, he went to place my order, then came back and apologized that Mijana got rid of their lunch menu and cheaper lunch prices.  I asked to speak to the manager because I had called earlier that day and owner told me lunch ends at 2:30, but when I got there and ordered my lunch, same lamb shank for $14.95 (lunch price) I had 2 weeks before, I was told that there is no more lunch menu.  I have to pay dinner prices.   I was so disappointed and blown away because I cannot order as much for my $20 voucher.  Manager said they did away with the lunch menu because the waiters \"the different lunch prices was so confusing for the waiters\".   I told the manager \"Wow you need to hire NEW waiters, waiters that GET it!\".   He did not agree.  Also my waiter was very new, I think it was his first day.  He did not even set my table, brought my pita and dip with no table settings, so I got utensils, napkin, and plate from another table and served myself.     I gave him a little less tip than I would have, cos he did not ever come and check on me, either.  I saw outside where there were two men at the next table, one man used the F word, every other word, and it was really disturbing to me.  I almost thought I would have to move inside, the day was so beautiful to sit outside on the patio, but that F word man also smoked.  They made my meal so much less enjoyable.  I was so relieved when the waiter brought their check and they left.   I never came across anyone who used the F word every F***ing word, and he looked late 30's or early 40's, not some young punk.  Quality varies, one time I got horrid brown-colored rice, tasted like it was put in a take out box, then put in the sun for 3 days. It was even slimy.   Server traded me for saffron rice, much better.  Another time I had spoiled vegetables.  Another time the kabob was burnt and dry and hard.  I sent it back.  I usually order the lamb shank, which does not come with any sauces, just dry.  The pita is especially good here, warm and the dish of black tahini that it is served with is one of my favorite reasons for coming to Mijana.  I give that 5 stars.    Mijana Mezza - awful, I sent it back.  The chicken wings were all dried like jerky, could not pull meat off the bones, and nothing I bit into, tasted good enough to take another bite.   It was expensive too $20, so i sent it back, and ordered my lamb shank again.  The squab was pretty good, but not much meat, and sometimes it came over cooked, like the chicken wings, dried up.  Many meats are over cooked here, I feel.    The belly dancing show starting at 7:30 is very short, maybe 20-30 min.    I will probably no longer go to Mijana, because the prices have increased, they no longer have the lunch menu (where dinner size plate can be had for much less $), and also the Living Social deals are no longer 50% off.",

Service, ambiance, food, and hookah-all terrific. My party of four ordered the mixed combo shawarma for 4 and a veggie platter and every single thing included in the platters was exceptional.

My fattoush salad (with grilled shrimp added) was also delicious (loved the olive oil/lemon juice dressing), & my husband was very pleased with his lamb kebab entree. More food than we could finish!

We walked into the adjacent hookah lounge, and found it to be cozy with large couches and charming Middle Eastern decor.  The staff was very friendly, and the bartender walked over from the restaurant and changed the TV channel from Middle Eastern pop to the football game for us.  My boyfriend was ecstatic to find that they serve kennafeh-- the only place in the Valley we've found so far!  It was very good, as was the double apple hookah.  The prices are definitely ok considering the ambiance, but we were a little surprised by the $3 charge for bottled water.      A bit later, the bartender walked over and invited us to the restaurant to view the belly dancers.  The belly dancers and the crowd certainly set the atmosphere for the restaurant to be fun and entertaining.  The bar was fully stocked with liquor, but I was slightly disappointed with their beer selection.      We went in for dinner a few days later, and were welcomed by a very friendly waitress and pita bread with olive oil to start.  I ordered the beef shwarma, which was awesome.  The spices were perfectly infused without being overwhelming.  I was most impressed by the side salad (always a vegetarian at heart), which was comprised of very fresh vegetables and dressed with amazing Italian vinaigrette.  My boyfriend ordered the stuffed grape leaves, which were also very yummy.      We finished the night on the patio with some pomegranate hookah, which I highly recommend.  The flavor was rich and didn't sting.      Overall, I highly recommend this place, whether you're looking for a quiet evening with amazing Lebanese food and hookah, or for a party with belly dancers or salsa lessons.",

I tried about 10 items, the worst I would rate at 8/10. I was in a bit of a hurry but will be back. I was planning on replacing a trip to starbucks with some Mijana Turkish Coffee, I did not try theirs today but have tried other Turkish Coffee and it is usually a delicious pick me up!",

They were all pretty unrecognizable, as they were all stewy like dishes, with lots of sauces and very little substance, meat or veggies.  Cheap, cheap.  Signage would be good, so people know what they are eating.  Varied menu if you do not order the buffet, but didn't enjoy anything we had, and between our large party, there were many items to taste.  Only good thing was the fresh, hot pita bread made all night. Service was slow and place is a large, empty, cold room.  Pretty dark and dirty.  No ambiance.  I won't be returning, and I love hole in the wall ethnic dives, but this one sadly sucks.",

    "text": "What a shame for  the beautiful Arabic word \" Mijana\" to be used as a name  for the most disgusting  food and Entertainment Establishment I have ever seen and experienced through out my Life, which made me  ashamed  of my Lebanese heritage for the first time ever. That was when I took my none Arab fiance and her family to this place in Tempe, after checking out their web side, describing how good and authentic the food is \"The meat will melt in your mouth\" , how friendly and jenurose   the management and the staff are  and how reasonable the prices are, which made me believe all the sweet talk on the web side. But when we got their every thing was the opposite of what the website and the made-up and fake reviews  on it,  states ...there was no one at the door to greed the customers , so we start wondering around where to sit... after ten  minutes some young lady took us to where she  made us sit and left without saying a word, After repeated attempt of  me to get  server's attention, finally he  came and talked to us,  so I asked him for the menu , he told me we have only a set menu, so I asked him but, can we see what is in it? And what the prices are? He told me you will know when we bring the food and the check. I was shocked but I kept it quite,   all this was in \"Arabic\".   we ordered drinks, then an hour later they brought us the food that from just looking at it, I realized that was at least few days old and reheated in the Microwave including the meat that did not melt in no once mouth, instead it got stuck in my thought and the portion they brought for six people, I could have ate it by my self if it was decent, Instead none of us touched it after the first terrible bite.. People there is not enough words to describe how bad the food was,  how rood  the staff were Including the Owner, how loud the music was, how outrages' the prices were , how lousy the entire  experience was and how  ashamed I was to take my fiance and her family to this shameful place . Please, do yourself a favor  do not believe the reviews on there web site, they are made up.  \"NOT REAL\" and avoid this place...It is Nasty... And to those who have been to this place already please understand this is not what Lebanese culture stands for.!!!!",

We were there last night, but there was a private event hosted inside the restaurant, so we were seated outside in the patio which was perfect because it was nice out. Despite that they were serving the private party, they managed to bring out our orders in a timely manner, got everything correct on the check, and multiple times- apologized for not filling water in time. Service was just  on point. I ordered the shwarma combo that came with chicken and beef, on top of saffron rice, with a side of salad and hummus. It was SO amazing! So flavorful and fresh and filling. I'd recommend getting beef shwarma- it will not disappoint!  They also make their own pita bread.. so warm and fresh!!  Without a doubt, you'll find me circling back to Mijana again to try their tea and some other dishes next time.",

I washed my hands and when returning i was greeted by a basket of home made warm pita and delicious dipping sauce! Then the food came out quickly and i was in heaven. Beautiful plate presentation, excellent seasoning, and overall great experience. I work for a big resort managing company and will suggest this place to my guests!

When I lived in Phoenix I drove by them for years and finally decided to get a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift card! I never used it while I live in Phoenix, so while out for a visit I tried it out with a friend. As soon as you walk into the restaurant you are greeted by the amazing smell of onions, garlic, and cayenne pepper! All of the smells just linger and dance at your nose! I selected a table and went through their menu. They have a great selection of chicken, beef, and vegetarian dishes. After debating for a few minutes I decided to get the chicken shwarma, which came with rice, a salad, and yogurt dip. My friend got their beef platter and a side of fries.   Before our meals they brought out pita bread with this brown dip with seeds in it that had a nice kick to it as well. I wish I would have asked what was in it as it was delicious and went so well with the warm pita bread.   My dish was excellent. The chicken had the right amount of spices and was not super salty or dry. The rice had a good crunch and I love that the salad had pickles and beets! The yogurt dip was also super tasty and I used that as a dip with the chicken and salad.   The customer service was just okay. Our waitress seemed a little pre-occupied with something in the back, so she did not stop by very much. The restaurant was not super busy despite it being lunch time, so I am not sure what was going on. One of the managers checked on us and assisted when he could. But, we did not get much out of our waitress.  With our meals and tax it only came to $35 and we took a lot of food home, so come prepared for that.",

Before I start with the food and service let me say that Friday and Saturday nights they have belly dancers from 7:30-10:30.  Too cool.  We started with a fig martini and mijana's fig mule.   We loved both.  The originality, sweetness, and so fresh.  The naan came out piping hot and so airy with labna (sp) with garlic and tahini, olive oil and sesame seed dip.  So wonderful.  The garlic was not overpowering.   Then we shared the mix grilled for one.  Highly recommend it.  There were 3 adequate sizes of beef and 3 of chicken.  The beef was tender enough to cut with your fork and lean.  It comes with yellow rice and a simple salad of chopped lettuce, cucumbers and tomatoes.  The only disappointing part was the salad dressing that comes on it tastes like Kraft Italian. The service was great.  They do not offer military discounts.",

I'm a very picky eater who has been trying out the vegetarian life for 3 months now and have never had Mediterranean or Lebanese food. Anyways we went on a Wednesday night around 6 PM. There was only one other couple there and our waiter sat us quickly and was very attentive.  He answered all of our questions knowledgeably and helped me decide on the pesto pizza which was delicious. Other staff we interacted with were friendly as well.   It's a very large restaurant and they were playing music at just the right level. I also noticed they have a live stage for shows which would be cool to come back for.   The only reason I gave four stars is because the computer was off-line and our order was never put in so we waited almost 45 minutes for our food.   Anyways the waiter informed us about the mishap, apologized and the delicious food made up for.   The overall experience was good and I will be back again for sure.",

It's a shame that they feel they have to take advantage of a group of women to make the extra money. Also don't ever make a reservation because I did and I was told there was heaters but they didn't tell me the heaters weren't working.

The restaurant wasn't super busy but the waiter barely checked on us. Members from our party had to get up multiple times to go find staff to get help.  Then when the waiter came to the table, the manager/owner came over to say something to him then they started having a very intense convo right in front of our table.  The drinks tasted like there was no alcohol in it.  I liked the environment with the music and belly dancing but the service would prevent me from going back.",

Another friend had  the pistachio smoothie with vodka - I don't even like pistachio and I wish I had ordered  one.

Fresh bread that did not taste like the normal pita bread we usually get. It was light and airy. We also tried these fried spinach puffs. And had a pizza wth gyro toppings. We had leftovers for several days.  I as very impressed with this place. It was a great surprise.",

I'm typically OK with kitschy furnishings if the building is a small space or a dive bar, but this is trying to look nice and really only coming across as cheap.  * the food is OK - but everything on the menu is a little too fried.  * their portions are always huge. If you like taking food home, this is great; otherwise, you'll either eat way too much or waste food.  * their service is pretty dang slow. I always get the feeling that they'll come around to me when they want to. I think most of the staff are family, which may explain the complacency.   The pros are that is has:  * other than the fried stuff, the food is very good * good location, and next to a hookah lounge * authentic cuisine  Give it a whirl, but keep the expectations down. Also make sure you have lots of time on your hands, because they certainly do.",

Our company came here during our one hour lunch break and we had to rush getting in and out with only one server on the floor. The manager personally went into the back and helped with cooking, packing, and processing payments. Due to our circumstance we were given a 20% off discount on our meals. Although, we could not sit to enjoy we enjoyed our food to go and it was amazing. It was a bit rushed but considering the circumstance I cannot deduct from the quality and service. Their intentions here were very well, the manager and server were extremely apologetic and sweet. I will be going back again when we do not have a time limit and sit down to enjoy. Thanks Trevor!",

We've tried the beef and chicken schwaramas, the gyro, the french fries, and the chicken kabob. It's all very mild, but flavorful.    The prices are a tad on the high side ($3 for a kid's lemonade), but if you get a groupon or a yelp deal, it helps.  The biggest draw for us is that at lunch, it's virtually empty, making it a great place for business meeting lunches because you can eat well and talk in a quiet environment. The food is made to order so it's not super fast, but if you have the time for a dine-in restaurant, give this one a try.",

The hummus was heavy as peanut butter and not creamy and smooth. The tabouleh as though parsley was pulled from the stems and thrown in, but not processed. Maybe they don't like African-Americans. Read the other reviews and decide. I was treated to dinner here twice by a friend, but it wasn't a treat. More like a sentence. I'm out for good!",

    "text": "\"Oh, our happy hour starts later because Wednesdays are hip hop night.\"  Well, OK then.  It was a weird experience at Mijana, but I thought the food was first rate.  I started with Lebanese beer named Alamaza.  It was a refreshing pilsner like a Heineken or a Carlsberg.  Fresh baked pita are served to the table with zatar, a dried herb and oil dipping sauce.  The pita had that homemade softness and yeasty flavor.  It wasn't chewy or sweet like store bought.  The zatar had a subtle flavor but a lot of aroma, smells that reminded me of my trips to the Middle East.  Hold off on pita refills because more come with dinner.  We ordered the shawarma combo for two, except it may as well have been a shawarma combo for 8.  It came on a big platter with hummus, rice, and a lightly dressed salad.  We had leftovers for days.  (I wish there was more hummus... we actually finished that.)  The chicken was better than the beef, which was a little tough.  Both were flavorful.  The rice had a light seasoning, but didn't overwhelm the meat.  Service was slow, but not inordinately slow.  Without any complaining, they comp'd us a free slice of chocolate cake.  The place has a large bar on one end, a stage on the other, and about as many tables and chairs as you can fit in between, all in neatly arranged rows.  It seems like they use it for receptions because they do.  They also have a night dedicated to salsa dancing, one for salsa dancing, and I'm forgetting one or two others.  They also have belly dancers on some nights... there's a lot going on at Mijana.",

We tried to give it a change again a few weeks ago, as it is located in a very convenient area for my family, but the experience was cut short...  We were seated and then ignored, despite the fact that there were only two or three other full tables in the whole restaurant. The waitress was friendly, but kept small talking to some people at another table while we waited perhaps 15 or so minutes to order. It looked like there was only one person in the kitchen, so we decided that it probably wasn't worth it.   It was slightly awkward, but we just got up and walked out! First time I have done that in my life. We ended up going to Princess Market and Cafe, which is much farther from us but about a third of the price. It is a nice, fancy looking place, but has expensive prices and poor service. Unfortunately, we won't be returning!",

Mijana is located in an unassuming location, in a strip mall northwest of the Tempe Marketplace. However, when we arrived we found a fully themed restaurant, complete with fun paintings representing Lebanese culture, and rich colors - definitely a casual and fun place to take a date. Though Mijana could definitely use a paint job or a bit of sprucing up,  I was happy to see that there was a stage in the restaurant, and so though I went at lunch time I have no doubt that Mijana probably throws down some lively music at nights or over the weekend.  i.e., If you're dancing at night you probably wouldn't notice the paint.   The service was good, and the food was pretty healthy.  The portions were large, and so the good news is that you'll have plenty of food to take home with you after a meal here.",

It's not a quick in-and-out sort of place, but that's bc they make everything fresh to order.  Some of these other reviews are ridiculous in their expectations.  Mijana is a place to go sit and enjoy an amazing meal with friends or family.  So no, do not expect the servers to be at your beck and call every 5 minutes.  We usually get the same few servers and they are very pleasant and friendly.  They remember us and where we like to sit, and what we usually order.  Anyway, their shwarma here is the best I've ever had!  The bread is also the BEST!  Mijana is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley.  If you like Mediterranean, check them out!",

Slow service, okay tasting food and very loud area because they were scraping chairs across the floor to get ready for the dancers.  They cater to the their ethnic group.  The short rude male waiter sucks! In more ways than one.",

The two servers were working probably 5-7 tables at the time. They were acting as: Hosts, hookah coordinators, DJ, servers, bartenders, takeout/delivery order takers, etc. They need more staff in my opinion. As a result the service was pretty cold and very slow.   It took way longer for us to eat than I think it should have but it's not really their fault for the restaurant understaffing.",

There's also live music certain nights, everything is on their event calendar on their website. They give complimentary fresh pita bread with a Za'atar and olive oil mixture. I ordered the Sujuk which is spicy beef sausage and it came with tomatoes, it was delicious.  I came on a Friday night and there was a belly dancing show from 7:45 to 8:15, quite impressive that it was 30 minutes long. The belly dancer is also interactive with the audience, so she might choose you to come up and dance with her. There's strobe lights, Lebanese music, overall a great and lively experience.",

Instead, it was us watching the cooking instructor make the different dishes (hummus, baba ghanoush, tabouleh, chicken shawarma). At the completion of each dish, the server served us that dish. It was nice to have a taste of it all and to know what the end products should taste like haha. The chicken shawarma meat was dry and not as enjoyable as it could have been. I've tasted better middle eastern food elsewhere (Haji baba).   The place looked like it needed a face lift when I walked in. It looked ancient and dry. The owner seemed down to earth when he introduced himself to us and gave us background on Lebanese culture and the food.",

After years of eating here now and this is my favorite restaurant now!  Jalapeno Hummus is a nice way to start off! Great flavor and just the right amount of spicy to it! Delicious!  The Shawarma Combo is the most wonderful explosion of wondrous flavor ever! I eat lots of shawarma and even make my own. The combo for two is quite exceptional to the point of being rather excellent, quite possibly even outstanding!  I get the pot of Turkish coffee and the tiramisu for desert for the best finale ever.   Good music everyday....   Live belly dancing Friday and Saturday nights makes an event out of dining!  They have a bar here if you want to get your drink on....  Stop by and tell them Vladimir sent you!",

The group also had a few appetizers and they came out fresh and nicely displayed, and it was a great introduction for our meal. My favorite was the Turkish Coffee.

I became concerned when I realized that the hookah shop was attached to the restaurant, and all the wait staff and cooks were wearing hookah T shirts. I am not a huge fan of the hookah but I have friends who are and depending what you hookah, you may or may not be able to do your job well. The waitress, who was scarce though there were only six patrons in the place, recommended the schwarma. I got the beef, friend ate the chicken. Sorry, but ugh. The tabouleh was 99% gritty parsley. So bitter hard to eat. Mine was not much more than little pieces of stir-fried meat with no flavor, then some no flavor rice. The reason for the two stars is the bread, pita style, that came with the hummus which was good. I could have been happy with just that. Wish I had. Then the poor service and the waitress who added 9$ to our check and when we showed her the discrepancy, said \"just give me what you owe me\". instead of recalculating which tells me: either she can't add, doesn't care, or has been to the hookah shop. My advice, skip this go for the hookah...",

The beef kabobs were a delight, however we asked for them to be rare, and they were medium at best.  The rice was wonderful and the pita bread is to die for!  Hummus is great as is the baba ganoush  Kenefe is our dessert of choice and it's wonderful, perfect ending to a meal there.

The fresh pita bread is cooked as you wait, it's fluffy and hot and makes you yearn for the old country.        Let me tell you about the chicken vegetable soup.  It is so good, I have actually never had soup this good.  You will love it.  Served in a cream sauce, lots of chicken and an array of fresh vegetables.  Wow!

There were plenty of seats at the front by the windows. I asked if I could sit up front and selected an open table, she reluctantly agreed.   Once seated it seemed to take awhile before she got back to me with water and a menu. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma and let her know I had a Yelp check in offering a free humus plate.  I'm glad I sat up front where it's light as the meal when served was very colorful and well presented. The yellow chicken Shawarma is served on a bed of yellow rice with a nice salad of lettuce, cucumber and tomato and some crunchy pickled vegetables. At first the Sharma seemed slightly bland but when eating along with the potent creamy garlic sauce it was very good.  The free humus plate was awesome very good humus served with a puddle of oil and a few chick peas on top along with some flaky and hot naan type bread. Very tasty and filling meal.  Make sure to check your bill if you use the free humus plate, they forgot to subtract it. This is a good place to eat. I think they could work on their service .

My wife went to use the restroom, and she came out wanting to vomit.  She states there was urine all over the toilet seat, that had been there for weeks.  So she asks me to check out the men's restroom to see if it was in the same condition.  Sure enough, it was disgusting!  There was urine all over the urinal, urine all over the floor, it stunk like a backed up sewer, and most of all there was urine all in the sink with pubic hairs.  WTH!  My wife makes mention of their current restroom situation to our waitress.  The waitress tells who we assume is the owner/manager of the restaurant of the restrooms condition.  He then makes her (our waitress) clean the lady's restroom.  Then we see the gentleman who makes the pita bread, go and clean the men's restroom.  To top it all off! Our waitress when finished with cleaning the lady's restroom, proceeds to the kitchen area, and places the dirty towel, and cleaning formula, next to the coffee maker.  Some mild mentions.  The beverages taste horrible.  They taste like they come from unfiltered dirty tap water.  The beverages ordered were a diet coke, and an iced-t.  We asked for our bill, paid and left the restaurant.     Mijana!  You need to hire a cleaning crew!  To have filthy restrooms that look like they haven't been cleaned in weeks, is highly unacceptable.  I highly recommend a water filtration system for your beverages.",

    "text": "I came here because I saw a post on Craigslist about salsa lessons and Latin night , nice looking place , hostess and host were very friendly and welcomed me , I grabbed a table by the bar , I ordered at the bar as I didn't see a server , it looked like they were pretty busy so I didn't worry about that , I ordered drinks and food , I took the salsa class , it was fun . Once I got back to my table , I ordered more drinks , went to the dance floor to dance and when I came back I saw a \"chair hugger\" sneaking my chair , I grabbed it back (having drinks on the table in Arizona apparently means nothing to other people) , I went back to dance on the floor and two men sat on my table , it was kind of weird how no one there wanted to respect that , I got there 1 hour before the craziness started so I would have a place to seat but people seems to not care , I am Colombian , yeah , feisty , so , please be respectful to me or you'll find trouble haha :) I would've never taken other people's chairs , don't do to others what you don't want to be done to you . After having a \"talk\" to the \"the chair hugger\" , I wanted to leave , she seemed rude , but I was there to have fun , so I looked for a table by the dj , found one and stayed there for about 2 hours , it was a fun experience besides the bad manners of some . I'm coming back here every week and I'll make sure to be on a place where no one want to seat so I don't have a bad time :)  Food was ok (maybe just what I ordered ) , I recommend the sangria .",

A large room with lots of tables and a stage on one end and a bar at the other.  The Food was OK but nothing to go out of your way for.  We ordered two wraps One Gyro with fries One chicken Shawarma with fries  Both had good flavor but not a lot of meat. We ordered the fries extra crispy they were not so good but edible.  Now the worst part was the service. I'm hopping this was a bartender or someone just filling in he should never wait tables again. There were long wait time in between getting things, he had no personalty and didn't seem to care if we were there or not.   I could under stand the lack of attention if they were busy but there were 4 tables at the most in the restaurant. During our meal I watched as our waiter was in the prep area eating and spending time talking with other employees when he should have been taking of tables.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone to go out of there way to try.  Oh well you can't win them all.",

While we perused the menu, our beverages came along with warm pita bread and a nice mixture of olive oil with sesame seeds and some herbs.  We finally decided on Kabob Chicken with rice and salad and a Chicken Shawarma sandwich with fries.  We munched on the warm pits bread and dip while we waited.  This place is vast and great for large parties of people.  There were 5 TV monitors with sports playing, a large bar and a huge room with many tables.  Our food arrived hot and looking tasty.  The Shawarma was very good as was the kabobs.  The salad was fresh and rice aplenty.   We didn't stay for the entertainment but other patrons were arriving for the free show.  Plenty of parking, and nice staff.",

The owner himself is running around not only attending guests to their table but also serve food and clean tables as when needed. I loved the chicken shawarma which I ordered and the hummus. As we wait for our food they provided us pita bread. Some points about the service which really annoyed. 1. There was no cutlery. 2. The waiter attended us more after more than 10 mins and it wasn't that busy either. 3. Foods came in late but that's okay!  4.

The basket of warm pita bread and dipping sauce to start the meal is so great. The bread here is unique. It is softer but still has firm texture.   I got Majina mix grill for one. It is a plate of rice, salad, and three skewers of beef, chicken, and kofta kebab. The rice is so tasty. It is not too oily and not too many spices but enough to enjoy them. They grilled the meats into perfection. Dipping them with yogurt is making the meat even taste better. The salad and dressing are also fresh and tasty.",

Middle eastern, but slightly different.  Probably regional influences as we were told this is Lebonese. Turkish coffee also very good, and very authentic.  A bit pricey, but we had a dining certificate which made the price reasonable.  We were very happy with our food.  It was quite good, and the service also was very good.  A solid four stars here.",

When we entered the restaurant there was nobody there to greet or seat us, so after looking around we sat ourselves. The restaurant was long, dark and well visited by a squad of house flies. A waiter came in reasonable time and brought us some pillowy housemade pita bread. It came with a lovely olive oil herb dip. Luckily the bread was folded inside a napkin cause the flies thought it looked good too. I asked the waiter 3 times before he finally \"tuned in\" to realize I was asking him a question, if we could be moved in order to sit where the flies weren't so bad. He moved us down a bit to place us under a fan. It was a bit better.   I ordered dolmades and a salad that came with a pomegranate maple syrup vinaigrette. It was so scrumptious. The dolmades were good yet different than any I've had. My partner had a lentil bean salad and it too was very tasty. But we both agreed the best part of the whole meal was the homemade pita bread. The inside of the restaurant was in desperate need of a facelift. The heavy red drapes and old worn out chairs were very outdated.... Not to mention the flies, did not lend itself to a pleasant eating atmosphere.   Also, I couldn't tell if the waiter just didn't speak much English, was too busy wearing both the chef hat and waiter's or If was just flat out shy. But I would probably show back up for another taste of hummus or another dish. I'll just make sure I park myself under the fan.",

Anyhow, we sat at our table and waited a few minutes to get service after we received our drinks and our order was taken. The food took a really long time and our server hardly checked on us during that time to see if we needed anything else.  Once we received our food, the presentation wasn't the best and neither was the taste. I have had definitely better experiences at other restaurants.  I am not sure if I would go and give it a second try, I would have to try out different Mediterranean restaurants so I can compare food quality and service.",

    "text": "First timer hoping to get some amazing Lebanese Food.  We ordered the Chicken Biryani,  Chicken kebab sandwich, and Tabbouleh.  We were served complimentary pita bread which was hot & puffed up straight from the oven.  They gave us an olive oil dipping sauce which had basil and different kinds of seeds in it including sesame seeds.  Nice bread and dip!   The biryani presented as some yellow rice at the bottom of the plate and many small pieces of chicken on top.  The chicken looked dry and when we tried it it was super dry.  Hubby said, \"I can't it this, I won't eat this\".  Wow. Usually he makes due with his dishes but after I tasted it, I realized how right he was!  The dish was exchanged gracefully by the server who explained that the chicken is cooked first and then it is cooked a second time when it is time to serve.  That explains it!  In its stead,  we ordered the ground meat kebab which came with yellow rice and a salad--a Much better dish.    The tabbouleh was really good.  The chicken sandwich, wrapped in a warm pita, was good & fresh, but the chicken lacked flavor.  Chicken has to marinate in spices and herbs for at least 24 hours if you are to get any type of flavorful meat when you grill it.  I ate most of it but the motivation to finish it was not there.  The chicken I did eat I did so because I dipped it into the yogurt sauce they served with the meal which was really good.  But the chicken should stand on its own without any add on's.  Later in the evening, a belly dancer began her performance and it is too bad that most people were chatting away and not really paying attention.  She did her best to entertain the crowd.   Food wise, Mijana should improve its flavor profile especially on the meats and of course overcooking meat is a sin of great proportions.",

I think they were out and trying to avoid actually making any thinking I wouldn't know better. They did get me sauce, but by that time everything was cold. The fries were not great.",

    "text": "Three stars because of burnt food and horrible waitress service.  We stopped in here a couple weeks ago. I think it's the 2nd time we've been there. The first time we were the only ones in the restaurant, the food was fantastic and our service good.   We ordered rice, hummus, garlic sauce, a gyro with salad, the chicken and fries children's meal and two drinks.   After serving us, our waitress disappeared. Thus we couldn't ask her for drink refills. It was pretty obvious the chicken on the children's meal was burnt when it was sat down but after we had a minute to look at it we realized it wasn't something that could be eaten it was so bad.   Again, no waitress. After about an hour, I got up from the table and wondered over to the kitchen where I watched two people talking. One of them was preparing bread for a couple that just came in.   I asked for an invoice. The woman who was preparing the bread had to get a male who appeared to the manager to tally our bill. When she came to give us the bill at the table she glanced down at the $7.99 chicken dinner and said \"oh, that's burnt.\" We agreed but we were still charged for it.   I asked her where our waitress was and why we never had a drink refill as I gave her my charge card. No answer. As we were preparing to leave the original waitress rushed in the front door.   I have no clue where she was but obviously  if she left someone should have come to check on our table.",

It means a lot!!!  I hate that the printed sheet they get does not print out all the information they should get? I put things in there that this restaurant did not get in the print out sheet! I read it! Things were missing!  Yelp's got to get that together! All this time I thought it was the restaurant not reading the FULL ORDER!!! YELP NEEDS TO MAKE SURE all the extras that are requested are in there!!! Thx! 10/1/16  My first time enjoying this place!  Forgot a few things in my order...Lentil soup was very good...Dolmas was good but a lot smaller than the pictures! they forgot the gyro and salad...brought back the gyro but no salad...he said he was doing his best!

The menu was easy to read, as there were photos next to the descriptions. For starters, the complementary pita bread was hot, fresh, airy and delicious. The bread went perfect with the Jalapeno hummus, which wasn't overly spicy. The kebabs in my entree were also perfect. The steak was tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked. The portions were very generous and the prices were reasonable. This is a great restaurant if you want to stray a bit from your comfort zone. You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "\"Is there anything else we can help you with?\" We were asked this question repeatedly Friday night. Arriving for a 7:30pm reservation we had our pick of tables as there weren't many diners. Given the choice we eagerly sat in an available booth. We both sat on the cushioned seating against the wall. Given our experience I'd recommend sticking with standard chairs, for reasons you may, or may not agree with.   \"Are you ready to order?\" Belly dancing is from 7-9pm (ended earlier). A wonderful show is put on near the stage. Tables in the center part of the restaurant (and the booths) have prime viewing. As this was my first visit I fastidiously reviewed the drink menu. To my delight there was a curious mix of drinks available. Margaritas. Long Island Ice Teas. Martinis. Jagermeister - Yeah. That was on there. As a drink. Neat. Nothing quite traditional sounding so I went with wine. In the meantime a glass of water was brought out.  \"Can we help you?\" \"Are you ready to order?\"  Erm- We'd just opened the drink menus.  Not quite. I explained this was my first visit. Hoping to hear something, anything. a handout to what a mezza might be, instead I heard. \"I would recommend ordering the Mixed Grill for Two...It has mwah mwah mwah mwah\" said incredibly fast. I blinked. She said the name of another dish quickly. I blinked. And then -  \"Do you need a few more minutes?\" Yes. I suppose so.   36 seconds later - We opted to try the Vegetarian Platter (huge) as an appetizer.  Hummus, Babaghanouj, Tabbouleh, (3) Falafel and (3) Vegetarian Dolmades. That's plenty of food to share with four people. Ambitious for two.  We were granted time to deliberate our entree order a few more minutes. Instead of the Mixed Grill shared plate (which sounded interesting: skewers of Chicken Kebab, Kefta Kebob and Lamb Kebob) Lamb tempted us. Specifically Lamb Shank and Lamb Kebabs.   The menu is separated into cold and hot mezzas. We made out like bandits quickly picking what we did. The food is stellar here.  At this point we began an interesting game I'll call \"Moving of the Plates and Glasses\". We were curious what our entrees might taste like once they were dropped at the table. So we got up and moved them from the far side of the table. You know, within fork reach. Then we slid the appetizer platter out. And the bread plate. And our empty water glasses. And my wine carafe. And the empty beer bottle. (Later I had an even larger collection of glassware.)  Where did everyone go? That's ok. I was distracted by the Fred Flinstone sized portion of my True to description, falling off the bone, lamb. Honest to god, I almost died.   But then - oh - my date reached suddenly behind my head with his napkin. His expression frozen with intent. I paused in only what second date behavior in public warranted.   \"Oh? Everything ok?\" \"Uh. There was ... a .. bug.\"  (IT WAS RIGHT BY MY HAIR. In the dark.) Later I asked my date to describe the bug. It's Arizona. These things happen. He said it could have waved at me. I have little hands. It was bigger than the tip of my thumb. (Also, it apparently got away.)  I recommend stand alone seating.  FOOD The Lamb Shank shocked me in sheer size. When I poked it with my fork gingerly the meat sighed. The grilled vegetables were delightfully seasoned, grilled and layered on top of a wonderful bed of rice. I wish I had grabbed an appropriate photo of the Lamb Shank. This is a dude's platter. Not for a girl on a date!   THINGS TO KNOW + Service is hit or miss. I finally flagged down a very nice man (possibly a manager) for my 2nd glass of water.  + Salsa lessons Fri/Sat night. Lights go off. Disco balls goes on. + Baklava is bone dry and hard. It was difficult to break into bite sized pieces. We returned it.  + Turkish coffee is divine! + Time your dinner well before dance class. Service ...changed as dance class preparations began.  DANCE HERE + It's a happening spot. When I left there was a line outside the door and beefy bouncers. Inside spectator watching (almost) made the service level worth it.   + $5 Drink specials! + Friday Night Salsa is produced by <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FAZSalsa.net&s=3db9e9128c2d4b902135f20f7401d403ba00bc0b8d56b0e59a7429c899d9dec3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">AZSalsa.net</a> \"Tumbao | Latin Fridays\". + Come dressed to impress!",

It was quite busy and they let us know food was 45 minutes out. Not a problem. We ordered apps which came timely along with their hot bread. Then we see things happening...there is belly dancing on the weekends that we didn't know about. It went on until well after we got our food and our son was mesmerized by it. Didn't complain once about being in the high chair for almost an hour but kept his focus on the dancer. And he ate a lot!  All the food we had was amazing (we shared a platter for 2) along with the Tzaiki app (best I've had and it was so fresh) and the hummus app (amazing). When we were leaving they were moving tables as they have Salsa dancing too!  We will definitely return for the food and entertainment. The only downside was the wait for the check and to go boxes after finishing.",

The class was a demonstration and then serving pre made foods. There were a lot of people and we were seated in the back, in combination with their soft voices, I had no idea what was happening. We were hoping to be more interactive. They also didn't let us know when the class was \"done\", so many stayed to wait for dessert. But there was none.  However, everything we ate was AMAZING. They completely changed my opinion on eggplants. Previously I hated them and was very intimidated to try anything with eggplant in them. Their baba ganouj was fantastic with their homemade naan (also amazing). They used a hint of cinnamon in their shawarma, which was great and paired perfectly with a tart garlic sauce. I would also recommend their hummus and tabouli.  Now the desserts were by far my favorite. Baklava is one of my favorite desserts, so I may be biased. I wanted to try some new desserts and ordered creme caramel and the knafe. Both were awesome!   I would highly recommend this restaurant for eating but I would not recommend the cooking class.",

    "text": "The food was great but the service was awful. I went here with a friend who raved about it and has never had an issue before. Everything started out fine, we were served by Zaya who was nice enough to turn off a fan above the table for us as we were cold. My friend ordered a plate and asked for no vegetables but the plate came out with vegetables. It was just a mistake, not an issue. The server went back to the kitchen and brought it back but it was very obvious that they had just scraped off the veggies and put rice over it. This would have been fine except they didn't scrape it all off. Underneath the rice was multiple big chunks of vegetables that they had just put rice over and the dish was cold. We then waited for 10+ minutes beckoning for the server and waiting for him to come back over to the table to request that they scrape all of the vegetables off. He very blatantly did not serve us even though he was serving tables around us. Finally, she got up and walked over to him asking that he fix the dish. Zaya returned to the kitchen with the dish and said that they would be making us a new one. When the new one came out, it was good but when the server had taken the last dish he had also taken the silverware. We waited for him to come back over so we could get new silverware but again, he did not wait on us. At this point, I was also out of water and wanted a refill but Zaya had not once come over to our table. He waited on tables all around us but not our table. After 15-20 minutes, he came back over and we finally asked for silverware though at this point we wanted to leave so we asked for boxes and the checks as well. When Zaya brought out the checks he went out of his way to tell us that the vegetables on the plate were not his fault and make sure we knew it was the kitchens fault. He had taken a picture on his phone of the order he had put in which had said no vegetables and showed us the picture. Until that moment, we had both still been fine. Slightly annoyed at the service but the vegetables on the plate hadn't been a big deal. The food was delicious and we watched the live dancing which was a lot of fun. Kitchens make mistakes and we understand that isn't the servers fault but in this situation, our bad experience was at no fault of the kitchen. It was the service. Furthermore going out of your way to make sure the blame is on someone else does not bode well. We had no issues with anything else except for our service and would still go back.",

Everything about the combo was fantastic and extremely flavorful. I like extra cucumbers, so I ordered the side of tomatoes and cucumbers, which made the meal just perfect for me. I also ordered the mango smoothie with amaretto. It was served in a tall glass  and you can bet it was empty by the time I was done. You will be so happy you tried this place! I even enjoyed the music and atmosphere on a Friday night  ((Good Friday). We missed the belly dancing at 730, but we were done eating by 845, and the restaurant was just starting to pick up because they were having salsa dancing lessons later!",

Tall blonde guy, the wings, were taken of the bill because they were so dang dry! Next they ran out of Hennessy, seriously Hennessy is a common drink! Next the wAters were empty for over a half hour, said he'd get a new cup with new ice and NEVER brought it and took over 10 minutes to bring the third round of drinks and that's when we were informed the Hennessy ran out, but he still brought the vodka drink, why would we want that if 2 of the 3 people weren't getting their drinks! Also the coal for the hookah took more than 20 minutes to replace! Serious improvements need to happen to say the least. Oh and lastly automatic gratuity was added and in our opinion he didn't deserve more than 5%. Very sad, I'll happily change this review if the owner would like to personally speak to me and make things right!",

They used to carry it at Trader Joe's but for some reason they stopped. Anyhow, I was unable to actually have a sit down experience but I stopped in and picked up a carry out.   The restaurant itself is well equipped for entertainment, and it sounds like they have nightly events. My server was very friendly, and I was able to get my carry out quickly. I waited at the bar for a moment while they were putting the carry out together, and witnessed a discussion between the young bartender and two customers. The customers wanted a Crown Manhattan, and suffice it to say, the bartender did not display great knowledge of bartending.   I definately hope to go back to Mijana and have  a full experience, their menu appears to be quite authentic and im always a fan of live entertainment.",

    "text": "We tried Mijana first because the Middle Eastern man working at the Honda dealership where we bought our Fit said it was the best Middle Eastern restaurant in Phoenix and he'd tried them all. When we saw the Groupon coupon offer, pay $15 for a $30 coupon, we jumped. Cost of gasoline for the round trip from Apache Junction was $8 that we included in our expenses.   Though the online menu said that there were two for one drinks and half-off cold appetizers during 5-7 pm Happy Hour M-F, that had been eliminated, along with the buffet I'd hoped to try from reading Yelp reviews. So that dented our budget from the start.   I'd decided on the lamb shank from the online menu, largely because it said there was a hamburger sauce for the rice, and every Greek and Middle Eastern restaurant where I've had lamb shank, the tomato-based meaty sauce, often with peas, carrots and onions, is the best part of the dish. No sauce of any kind. I asked the waitress, who checked the menu and saw it said a hamburger sauce, and she went to the cook to get some.   He told her that customers didn't like it so they discontinued the sauce. The menus should be updated to delete references to Happy Hour deals and the sauce. The smallish lamb shank was fine but average without a sauce. Rice was very good--moist and well seasoned. Accompanying salad on the plate had a yogurt and cucumber cup of dressing on the side, pretty bland.   The babba ghanouj appetizer at $7 was excellent and plentiful, and the freshly baked pita bread is outstanding while warm. The wait staff were pleasant and quick to respond, and the owner or manager came over to personally check on our satisfaction.   We were the only customers there at 5 pm when they opened, and by 7 when the belly dancer show was to start, there were two other tables of 2 and 4, and two tables of 14 or so that seemed to be of students and perhaps university staff. They seemed enthusiastic about what was to come, and they were eating heartily and having a great time.   So it was perhaps us, and our expectations of Lebanese food that we've enjoyed elsewhere through the past 50 years, including the Middle Eastern food at Haji Baba's nearby, a small restaurant tucked inside a grocery market. That remains our Middle Eastern favorite in the Phoenix area. Pita Jungle is pretty good, as we remember.   We'll still be on the lookout for new Middle Eastern restaurants, hopefully with the sauces and tastes we've enjoyed through the years. Good service, other than the waitress bringing my partner's Greek salad entree a good ten minutes before my lamb shank came out.   I'm sure Mijana's is a swinging place once the dancing starts! Total bill, with only the one Margarita and one appetizer and no other drinks or desserts, including tax and tip, was $56. So we paid $41 plus $8 in gasoline. Remember, the pita, rice, and babba ghanouj are outstanding. Three stars overall.",

Second time there was during the friday night belly dancing. Service was slow. Restaurant wasn't that busy, but everyone looked in the weeds. Got the chicken kabobs and first thought was that there wasn't a lot of chicken. It was very good tasting, just seemed like a small portion in comparison to the shwarma. I'll give the place another try and see how it goes....",

We started with appetizers - the olive and pickle platter and the falafel plate.  Both very good - there must have been a jars worth of pickles on the plate (although definitely not from a jar).   The entrees were the stars.  The Mijana platter for one was very good but the Lentil and Beet Salad was outstanding - the carmelized onions, lentils, feta, greens, cucumbers, etc.. was a flavor filled delight.  The combination Shwarma platter rivaled the salad - tender pieces of marinated meat and chicken served over rice that melted in your mouth. We were full but based on the quality of the rest of the meal we had to try desert.  The waitress recommended the Knefeh (not sure I've spelled that right), and boy was she right, a blend of slightly sweetened cheese with semolina noodles that I can only describe as a Lebanese creme brulee.  A great way to end the meal.  We would have loved to top it off with Turkish coffee but it was late and we needed to get home to sleep... and to dream of our lovely meal at Mijana.",

I only wish I knew what most of it was because nothing was labeled.  When we asked our waiter? what kind of soup, he said he didn't speak English but would go to the back and find out; it was lentil soup, and it was very good.   There was hummus, baba ghannoush and a couple other unknown dips to eat with the delicious homemade pita bread.  Check out Norm R's photos of the puffy pita pockets - they tasted as good as they looked!  There were stuffed peppers, chicken on the bone and a couple platters of red sauce - one had beans and an unknown meat - another had squash? with what seemed to be lamb meatballs.  I just wish they had some sort of dessert other than the canned fruit cocktail and some sort of pudding? that tasted good, but again, we had no idea what it was.  Baklava would have been the perfect ending to the meal.    The service was almost non existent, the music was a little too loud for lunch even after Rand asked them to turn it down a bit, and not only did we have to chase them down for our check, we actually paid standing at the waiter station.    I did check out their regular menu and while everything looks good, it seems a little pricey.  The lunch buffet was reasonably priced at $9.95.",

We were excited when we looked at the website promising belly dancing and live music and a Lamb Shank that falls off the bone. So the Lamb Shank lived up to the hype, but we were the only customers there for most of our visit, which actually made it kind of nice :) and no live entertainment. So we laughed out loud & enjoyed our friends.  We tried the Quail hummus... delicious! I had the fattoush salad... the taste was good but the size of the veggies was not appealing to my mouth, I would prefer a more chopped friendly salad. My friends were happy with their choices which I tried & all the food was at a high standard of preparation. The authentic beer selection was terrible.  The service was personable, very authentic & spicy ;) I liked the feel of the place, the owner was there & checked on us - he gave us coupons for the buffet & we are excited to go back for more. He also explained that they were packed through the holidays & decided to give the live entertainment some time off, but encouraged us to come back to check it out. Woohoo!  All in all, nice find!!",

They confused our reservation time, wrote it as 6 p.m., when it was actually confirmed as 6:30 p.m. They also tried to seat us at two tables rather than the long table in the center, because they thought we were a reservation of 6 rather than the confirmed reservation of 13. They also confused my order and gave me a yogurt cucumber salad, even though I ordered the cucumber tomato. They told us that they were expecting a wedding party at 8 p.m., and wanted us to vacate the table by then, which we politely did, but it did anger me. I'm not accustomed to being pushed around and hurried out of a restaurant. My family owns restaurants, and we do not treat people so rudely. They need to become better organized and need better customer service. We left at about 8:10 and the wedding party had yet to arrive!",

There was a groupon for the place and I have never tried it so I thought we would go. Waited 5 minutes to get seated. There was only 1 server, which is not unexpected as it is a week night. There was a nice big screen TV with the NFL network on, which was nice. Also some Lebanese music videos which is interesting. The owner was very personable and actually greeted us. Never had Lebanese food, but it tasted pretty much like Greek/Persian food. Hummus was fresh. The bread they made was good. Got the kabobs and they were cooked well; moist win the good flavor, not dry and overdone. The service was what really got to us. Waited for the check for a good 40 minutes before their server actually brought it to us. Not sure if it would have been better if it wasn't a night of 20 people for the server. Not sure if I would go back.",

For example, the kofta plate is $13.95 at Mijana, and at Pita House it is $14, but the kebab, the salad and the rice were all more flavorful at Pita House.  The filet mignon kebab is $19.95 at Mijana, while it is $16.95 at Tasty Kabob in Tempe, and I know for sure the latter is fantastic.  Hummus is $5.95 at Mijana, but just $4.50 at the wonderful Sahara which has been in Tempe for two decades.  Service:  the wait staff at Mijana was very attentive.  Ambience:  we arrived on a Sunday night around 8pm and a DJ was playing loud reggae; it was hard to talk.  There was a cover charge if you were there to see the DJ (we weren't), so clearly Mijana is not quite sure if it wants to be a restaurant or a night club.",

    "text": "ok, ok...so for the first 30 minutes we had fun with the name of this restaurant...but then we simmered down and got down to some serious eating business. We went with another couple on a Saturday night at 6pm. Ambiance - The place was packed with a huge party, but that just made the atmosphere fun! There was background music and a couple belly dancers.....We were seated in a private booth and could engage in conversation with no problems. I grew up in Australia with Lebanese family friends and was privy to delight in authentic Lebanese food at family events,  so I am familiar with the real deal. Having lived in Arizona for 15 years, I crave traditional ethnic food. This place did not disappoint; In fact at times I was rendered speechless. I ordered the vegetarian platter - baba ganoush (amazing and not bitter at all), hummus (thick and creamy), tabouleh (light and not too garlicky) and the most delicious light and soft dolmas I have ever had. I also ordered a side of kibbe which were tasty little morsels, but needed a little more zing. The accompanying yoghurt dressing was delicious. My friends had a the lentle soup and chicken shishkabob and said both were amazing. We are currently planning a return visit with the kids.....  oh and the dipping bread is warm and light...fresh out of the oven  Enjoy!",

We also got a great portion for the price we paid. Ordered the \"mixed grill for four\" which costs $56! At first I had doubts it would feed that many people because most places are stingy with their portions and I usually eat a lot, but Mijana def. gave us out money's worth. The mixed grill for four actually fed 5 of is and we had a little leftover. The food was very fresh and grilled to perfection. The atmosphere was very nice and they played traditional Arabic music. The service was good; our waitress was very nice but a little slow at times. Overall I would def. recommended mijana as a great restaurant to try traditional middle eastern food. Oh, we also purchased a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift card  for our visit which made it even more worth it.",

    "text": "If only the food and service matched the looks!    While it looks plain from the outside, Mijana is large and open inside, combining a fairly casual atmosphere with near fine dining visual appeal.  If I was basing this review on the look of restaurant alone, with its tall ceilings and long family-style tables, it would certainly get a 5 star rating!  HOWEVER, Mijana is probably the most over-priced and over-rated restaurant in the entire area!  With Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food not as popular as Italian and Asian fare, many of Mijana's close competitors shut their doors in response to these tough financial times and I can only guess that this lack of options/alternatives is responsible for Mijana receiving any positive reviews at all!  I have eaten here 4 times.  Twice I went with family, two other times I went with friends to see one of the weekend evening dance specials that people I know were performing in.  While I commend Mijana for supporting local dance talent, the restaurant's primary concern should be supporting the paying patrons!  After 2 tries, my immediate family refuses to return and my friends, except for the ones dancing, have not been back!  Each of the 4 times I have gone, the service has become more and more dispicable and the food has only become less and less edible.    The reheated pans of low-grade and truly off-tasting ingredients at the buffet only seem like a \"bargain\" for the price until you actually try it.  What doesn't get eaten one night seems to get reheated for the next night's dinner service and the next, etc...  The food off the regular menu is way overpriced in relation to the quality that ends up on your plate.  The dishes are unoriginal and, despite the fact that the stereotypical Mediterranean/Middle-Eastern fare should be predictable, the only thing you can count on is that it's bland and will probably be cold to the touch by the time the server finally brings it to your table!  The waitstaff is almost always insufficient (a cost-cutting measure by a greedy owner?) with only 2 servers (if you're lucky) working most weekend dinner services.  Speaking of service, it is consistently the slowest I've ever experienced at any restaurant.  Additionally, food items do not arrive together (members of my group were often served at different times and TWICE we didn't get bread for our Hummus appetizer until AFTER we completed the main courses, even though we made the server aware) and that's just the start!    Bringing any issues to the attention of the floor manager simply results in a dismissive attitude and no results...if he is in a GOOD mood!  When he's not, he'll treat you like a dog.  The way my mom and I were spoken to when we asked about drinks (after a 25 minute wait at the table without even water to sip on) was appalling!  And, the servers could care less.  They don't \"serve\", but they sure don't hesitate to express their upset when the tip is lacking.  You will not leave feeling even remotely appreciated or valued as a customer, I guarantee it!  If you do decide to dine at Mijana, prepare yourself for a long, expensive night of substandard food and the worst customer care in the Valley!  Unless your friend is dancing there that night or you want to torture your most hated in-laws, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else...anywhere else!",

    "text": "To put it succinctly, the service at Mijana bordered on the comically absurd.    Before weaving this narrative, I will disclaim that it blows my mind that after years of being in business (and countless reviews attesting to the sub-par service) that there has been little to no improvement in that department.  Our party arrived for \"International Night\" at 7p on a Sunday night.  (The second Sunday of each month this restaurant hosts a few performers/acts from varying parts of the world.  Tonight we got to enjoy Brazilian Samba, Egyptian Bellydance, and Spanish Flamenco.  The entertainment was wonderful!  Upon our arrival, the restaurant was less than half empty.  I noticed three servers and the manager/owner in attendance.  As we were seated we immediately asked for a high chair for our toddler.  That high chair arrived about an hour and a half later.   It probably took 15 minutes before we received menus.  No drink orders were taken, no waters brought to the table  (They arrived about a half hour later).  We had been seated for about twenty minutes before I flagged down a server and asked if we could order.  Her reply was, \"she has not come, yet?\" and took off to find our server.  When our gal arrived, there were no apologies or explanations.  We pre-empted our order with the disclaimer that we were all very hungry and wanted to order right away.  So our orders were finally placed after we had been at the restaurant for nearly thirty minutes.  The beer I ordered never arrived, but I had to get up and let the server know once my third appetizer plate came to the table.  No apologies.  I ordered seven hot appetizers.  The first three arrived about thirty minutes after they were ordered.  The Quail, Fatayer, and Foul Moudamas.  Quail (sauteed over hummus): Perfect portion for one person, absolutely flavorful and delicious.  Crisp and spicy/sweet on the outside, juicy and flavorful on the inside.  Fatayer (four spinach pies with onions, sumac, and line nuts): Nothing to rave  about, basically a lackluster version of Spanakopita without the feta.  Foul Moudamas (fava beans cooked with garlic and lemon juice, topped fresh diced tomatoes, cilantro with drizzle of olive oil): Loved this, fresh and packed with flavor.  I had to get up and get more bread for our dips, as server was nowhere to be seen.  I had to constantly clear the table of plates as no one came to the table to do so.  At one point, about an hour and fifteen minutes after we arrived, the owner came to the table to ask how the food was  (the music was so loud I was virtually screaming at him and I barely heard him).  I handed him a stack of plates that I was just clearing from the table and mentioned how the food tasted great, but we were all still hungry...hint hint.  The server never came to follow up on our food, to ask if we wanted refills, or just to see how everyone was doing.  Around 8:30p, one hour after our orders were placed, I had to once again get up and find the server to ask about the remaining dishes I ordered.  At that time she informed me that they were out of two of the appetizers I ordered.  No Sambusek, no Makanek.  No apologies.  Fine, but the appropriate thing to do would have been to come to the table and inform us about this, and offer something else instead.  Long story short, she mentioned that my Chicken Shawarma Hummus was on its way, more than an hour after I ordered it.  The final appetizer I ordered, would arrive an hour and fifteen minutes after order was placed.  Hummus Shawarma (chicken over hummus with pine nuts) My favorite dish of the night, tasted exactly like Pita Jungle's version  (Just costs more).  The chicken was outstanding.  Soft, succulent, and savory.    Garlic shrimp (sauteed shrimp in garlic cilantro)  Second favorite dish.  Generous portion of gorgeously plump prawns, well seasoned and very flavorsome.  We snickered collectively when the hostess of the evening announced that the entertainment was coming to a close, and that there would be Samba lessons.  I quote, \"I hope that your food has settled so you can enjoy some dancing lessons.\"  Everyone's entrees literally arrived an hour after we had come to the restaurant, right when the hostess opened up the dance floor for some lessons.  The music was so loud that I had to stuff mine and baby's ears with tissue - we were literally yelling in each other's ears so we could hear one another.  Our sweet baby had an amazing time, though!  She loved the music and the dancers and was captivated the entire time.  We were so lucky to have the entertainment to keep our minds off our growling (roaring) bellies.  Our bill arrived close to 9p, after I once again made the journey to find our server and request the bill.  No thank you's,  no smiles, no apologies from her.    However, I would love to return for future International nights.  I will likely sit at the bar with no expectations of food or service - maybe a cocktail and some shisha.",

The only positive experience was the bread that was brought out before the meal. It was delicious! Many of the food and drink items were NOT available due to \"having a busy weekend, we couldn't restock,\" (which upon further inspection of reviews this seems to be a common problem at this place) according to our waitress. There was only one waitress available so the service was definitely below par, which was hard to believe since there were only three tables (including us) to serve. Then finally when the food came out there were TWO blonde hairs found in the food (and that's only what was FOUND, I can only imagine how many more might have been in there). The fries DRIPPED grease. Literally, you could twist the fries and grease would POUR out.  I would NEVER go here again, and would tell everyone to steer clear of this place.

Food portions were very big.  Vegetarian platter could easily serve two.  Quality of food was fair, especially on the mixed skewer platter.  Meat was chewy and it was overload of rice and salad.  I can't compare to other Mediterranean restaurants in town, but I travel regularly and prefer to choose Mediterranean restaurants for my whole food plant based WOE. This one ranks right in the middle.  I've had better and I've had worse.  Got food quickly.  Server was slow with refills and check.",

This was a takeout, I ordered around 9:40pm, and they had it ready for pickup around 10:15pm.   This is a big deal if you've taken a flight into phx, hungry for something, and have prior knowledge that most restaurants in Phoenix close by 9pm.   So, for being available this late and for being somewhat punctual - that's one star each, and a third for the decent food.",

Only a couple tomatoes and the rest was greens for 20 Bucks! The surprise came with the check, as the waitress put all our little sides as Appetizers. So we ordered and payed way more than we wanted and everything she said was, that she thought this was better for us because the sides are really small...",

There is much better Mideastern food in the Valley. The prices were high but the cost for us was offset by the Groupon we had. What was really awful was the service, it's Sunday night the place wasn't too busy. We waited a long time for anyone to take our order. Our food came quick but that was it. No water refills, no how is everything? no can I get you anything else? No dessert menu, etc. We were finished eating and waited 25 mins for someone to bring our check. We have a one year, and and it's 8 at night. We were ready to go. I usually always tip 20% +++, this time we didn't. We won't be back and I don't think they'll notice either way. Sometimes you can see why some businesses are always on Groupon.",

    "text": "After looking and looking for a place to take a friend from Mexico to, I came across Tumbao, Latin Fridays. It was quite the drive, but I decided, why not! I have someone to dance with.   It was quite a drive, but who cares when you're in good company. We pulled into the parking lot, and I was a little thrown off by the location -- but parked anyways and as soon as we opened the car door, we heard that Latin music playing; we knew we were in the right place.   We walked up, got ID'd by a pleasant gentleman at the door, and went inside -- only to get asked to pay $10 cover per person, which kinda stinks if you get there late. They give us like a raffle ticket which we were told were good for a free soda or bottle of water at the bar -- but when is a soda or a bottle of water ever $10?! (unless of course, you're in Vegas... but this isn't Vegas!)  The music and atmosphere was great though, and I had a fun time. I would definitely go here again as it's a laid back, and a great crowd (amazing dancers too, btw!) Apparently this is a Lebanese restaurant, and I'm sure the food is great, but we didn't get to try it... Maybe another time. As far as Tumbao Latin Fridays -- I recommend! (But get there early!)",

Our server had a sense of humor, proven when I ordered an alcoholic drink (Figs & Kisses) and she said, \"We don't sell alcohol until 5\". I must have looked either startled or dumb founded because she started grinning. I knew then we were going to like Mijana. Some items on our table: cheese borek (appetizer), zatar & bread (hot & fresh from the oven), chicken kebab (it's at least 3 meals!), Beirut nights (dessert), and jallab (non-alcoholic drink). After the desserts, we pushed back from the table, smiles & sighs of contentment from us all.",

Score for diversity!  On to the food- I ordered the hummus which was absolutely delish, and the paella which was to die for! It came with saffron rice, tomatoes, cucumbers, mussels, and shrimp. It was so so good! My only wish is that this place was closer to where I live! Will definitely be back!",

This time the chicken sharma had a strong vinegar taste. Our two sharma plates were replaced with chicken kabob. No difference in taste.  The owner says we serve all day just fine. I explained today was not up to par. Very disappointed and we won't be back.",

We came in at around 8:40 on a Friday and the hostess informed us they were having a salsa night so we would have to eat on the patio unless we wanted to pay an extra $10 per person to sit inside for salsa night. Fine. We sat outside. Waited about 20 minutes for a server to finally get us water and menus. We told them we had a Groupon, made our order. Then another waiter came out to tell us that we can't use the Groupon because they stopped serving dinner at 8. Seriously, 8? On a Friday night? They said we would have to pay full price for dinner since they were already heading into \"special event\" time. OK, yeah. Great service guys. Just glancing at the menu, way too expensive for Mediterranean honestly and you could get equally good Mediterranean at the various markets and cafes in town. It's no wonder they're desperate to gouge you for any penny they can since I doubt anyone would come here to eat normally without an \"event\" or Groupon.",

Our server was even very attentive (and knowledgeable) despite the two large birthday celebrations demanding lots of attention. There was hookah service available, outdoor seating and a small bar area with a several large televisions if you want to enjoy dinne televised sports while you eat. The only reason I am not giving them a 5th star rating is because it was a bit organized upon our arrival, no one greeted us initially at the door so we had to wait a bit, and a couple take were seated after us and received service by the wait staff before we did. But all is this was due to the large celebrations going on that night. Many of the wait staff seemed to have been helping out there instead of working the other tables. Despite that, I will return, perhaps on a weeknight for regular dinner service.",

It's hard to find places that will do that and understand the love for how awesome it is.   Restaurant staff is always kind and awesome. I have came here for lunch. Usually can't get back to work within the lunch hour. Takes about a hour and 10 mintues ( I work at skysong). Dinner is also very good. I have been here well over 40 times. Love it!!",

    "text": "This is an updated review which I will update again if I choose to give this place another chance and they do better on a future visit. I visited here before for a cooking demo which was awesome. We got to try the food which was absolutely fantastic and it was a great time in every sense so of course I had to come and enjoy dinner here. So, visited for a Friday night date night and we were sat close to the front door (also the door that leads to outside seating area). We'd just missed the belly dancing and we were bummed about that but couldn't wait to try their food because I LOVE Lebanese food. Looked over their extensive menu and decided but had a few questions. No one came to us to take our order although someone did come by with waters. Apparently the owner took our order since he saw us looking around. We learned you cannot substitute anything on the menu (at all). I don't like eggplant so simply wanted more hummus on the veggie platter but had to get separate appetizers as my meal instead. My partner didn't want rice with her meal but had to get it anyways since it came with it. OK fine, now we know for the future. The food came pretty quickly but we had no idea who our server was since no one introduced themselves to the table. If we needed anything like more water, sauce, napkins we asked the server who was taking care of the table next to us. Unfortunately she wasn't very good and turned out that she was our server as well. We only found out when we had to ask for the check and boxes. It was not an enjoyable or relaxing meal either because all the tables in the center of the dining area were being moved since they had salsa dancing on Friday nights. This was around 8:20pm or so and we were like I said, by the front door where all the tables were being moved. Definitely not a relaxing or enjoyable experience for us. Might go again for lunch during the week when it's slower and no tables are being moved around. Be forewarned if you visit on a Friday night and are looking for an intimate experience.",

    "text": "I walked in on a Sunday night with a family member when there was practically no one. We were seated to a table within a timely manner. As I was skimming the menu, there was a middle-aged cook staring me down almost as if I had committed something immoral. It made me feel extremely uncomfortable. To get my mind off this man, I took a look around the restaurant, only to realize that the decor was absolutely dreadful. Boxes from their dance nights were piled up on the side and forgotten about. In addition, the paint on the walls didn't match the environment they were trying to evoke.   Nonetheless, after the two of us looked over the menu, we decided to go with bowl of hummus and their mixed grill for two. As we were waiting for the hummus, we received naan bread and some sort of dipping sauce with sesame seed and olive oil. The sauce was loaded with so much seasoning that I thought I was going to go into some sort of cardiac arrest. I waited for the hummus to dip my bread in, only for the hummus to taste as if it was store-bought. Shortly after, the mixed grill arrived, and it contained overcooked meat that had low-quality vinaigrette spread all over it.   If it weren't for my Groupon for $21 off, this meal would have totaled to over $70 (including the tip). If you want to feed yourself and one other person, I can think of a long list of restaurants that will serve you a better quality meal for half of this price. I was really let down from going to Mijana. Hopefully they turn something around soon, because their shirts that say \"Rated #1 by Phoenix New Times\" are completely redundant.",

The wait times in between her coming back to our table were ridiculous.  We were sat and she came to take our drink order....but after that, I don't think we saw her again until the end.  One of our friends had to get up and go get who looked like to be the manager or owner to take our order, because we had already waited at least 20 minutes.  We finally order and then they're out of what I ordered, and wasn't told of this until after we placed our order.  The food was only ok.  For what I paid for the lamb.....it wasn't even juicy and lacked flavor.  My boyfriend did not like his quail at all.  From the time the plate was set down it looked like it was completely dry. ...and it was.  Had absolutely no flavor or anything to it.  He was not happy at all with it....especially for the price.    This place has potential, but with the service and cost for bad to decent food....we will be visiting other places over this one.",

The servers are very attentive to the hookahs, frequently coming by to make sure it's working well and fixing the coals. The food is good and reasonably priced- we love getting the cold sampler platter of baba ganoush, hummus and tabbouli. The bread is freshly made and comes out warm and delicious!

The place was empty around 7:30pm on a Friday night. The belly dancing show is one girl who does three routines in a 25 minute time span with breaks and it's over...so don't blink. The reason I gave this place three stars is because the food is bland and the meat is dry. Pita Jungle serves better food than this place. I would rather go and spend fifty bucks and get great food than to sit and eat mediocre \"bland\" Arabic food and watch a girl thrust her stuff for 25 minutes. We had good service because the place was empty on a Friday night. So if you want want to be entertained and eat bland food come here.",

It comes hot out of the oven. Also had some sort of oil sesame seed I don't know the name of which was really good. For the main course I had the lamb shank which was nice and soft and came off the bone and onto my rice. Yummy.  The hookahs come from next door and they were good, and the coals were added regularly without having to ask for it.  Service was great with everyone checking on us regularly.  Decor isn't the greatest and has a ethnic-restaurant feel to it but I don't mind that.  Live entertainment with Lebanese music, belly dancer next door, and people dancing was pretty nice.",

But the food is flipping awesome ! Man those pita breads are warm and fresh out the oven. The chiken kababs are delish ! Yummy in my tummy. The service is very good, and we've alway left here happy. Very good overall.   Words of advice: Salsa night aint all that packed. Stay away from the lebaneese wine. Aint no good ! And the bartender doesnt know how to open it without getting the cork in ! lol !",

I was seated right away my hostess who was very nice. I ordered a couple different dishes including the cheese platter and Beirut special which were all delicious. When I was done with dinner this is where I have dropped my rating from 4 stars to three... the service at the end was really bad. By the time I was done there were only me at my table and two people hanging out at the bar. I waited about 25 minutes sitting looking around for my waitress. .. really??!!! I left at about 840pm but was done with my meal at 8. I eventually got up and walked over to the kitchen and asked for a to go box. The very sweet man making fresh pita bread helped me. That's when my waitress remembered that I was still there. .. All in all it was good atmosphere, good food, nice staff but I will not be back soon to dine by myself again.",

The food is without at doubt very good, fresh, flavorful and authentic, but the wait staff could use some sprucing up. Every time We have been there the wait for water refills or just to order have always taken longer than I would like, but they do have the BEST FRESH pitas! The owners/management has always been very polite, helpful and generous and on Saturday nights they sometimes have belly dancers, which adds to the over atmosphere and ambience. Portion sizes are enormous and I've left with a box full of leftovers everytime. I highly recommend the shawarma platter for 2, or the mixed grill for 2, and the Lebanese tradition as an appetizer. You cannot go wrong with their stuffed grape leaves either! The only complaint would be mediocre service, but the food is so good We come back every few months and give it another shot.",

The employees are nice (at least the ones I met), but if you come here be prepared to 1) not have your food for an hour and, 2) drink very slowly as you will get a refill maybe once.  What was so weird about the service is that the place was practically empty and it STILL took forever. Later it filled to the brim as there was a belly dance performance, but the service stayed the same from the full hour of emptiness to the hour of being packed.  Mijana seems to rely on the other things it does (like the belly dances) for people to come in because the food, while good, was not good enough to justify the prices they charge nor get the incredibly slow service they provide.  Essentially, if you're going just for the food, there are better options.",

We went for lunch, which must be their slow time. The ambience is definitely more for a nighttime group outing. There's a sound stage and posters for belly dancing and tango. Also, the hookah lounge next door seems to be at least brothers with this restaurant. I was deforest underdressed had I gone for dinner.   Maybe because the empty restaurant, the staff (possibly the family that owns Mijana?) was very attentive. The handmade fluffy pita kept coming, which was good, because it took two of us three rounds of bread to finish off the hummus, babaghanouj, and tabbouleh plate. I ordered the lentil soup, which just tasted like autumn (that's a GREAT thing). My boyfriend had no complaints about the beef shawarma plate. I wish I had had room for some baklava for dessert!  4/5 stars: I'd like to see if this amazing food and service is kept up at night.",

Arrived about 7pm and they were just about to get the last few hot dishes out for the buffet. The place was fairly empty and I was greeted by the owner and a lovely hostess before being seated near a window. The atmosphere was looking good and you can tell this place can go nuts with the dancer's and music other yelpers mention.  The buffet had a full line-up of Mediterranean cold dips (Tzatziki,  Babaganoush, Hummus, etc..) to accompany a salad bar, and another section for very flavorful hot dishes such as eggplant, roasted chicken legs/wings, meatballs with peppers/onions/potatoes, aromatic lamb shank on rice, cous-cous, rice with lentils, and a tasty vegetable tomato-based stew. For dessert I tried a sort of cold pudding that was adorned with crushed pistachios - very tasty!  Very happy with the meal here (any buffet with lamb has my vote), but I might hold off until a special event night where I can entertain a date or party for the $16 price tag. I would also suggest coming in early on a slow night as the owner would have little reason to keep everything topped up with an empty house (and the lamb goes fast!)",

Why was my lamb tough?  Where did you get this super thick pita bread?  Who taught you to make hummus?  Save your money and go to Pita Jungle instead--other than hearing Arabic, I felt it was just as authentic as the cheaper option.  In fact, I'd go here if there weren't several other \"pita jungle' type options in the area.  PRO: they had the right pickles.  That counts for a lot.  If you want to hang out and smoke shisha, this is definitely your place.",

    "text": "I recently discovered Mijana while visiting the Goodwill that just opened up in the same nondescript strip mall.  I first saw it from across the parking lot and I walked over to investigate.  There were tables set up outside and a hookah bar next door.  A poster on the window of Mijana advertised belly dancing.  It looked like a cool place and I made a mental note to check it out soon.  A few days later I found myself sitting across from my girlfriend in the spacious interior of Mijana.  This place is huge and a great deal of effort has been put into making it classy.  There is a large stage with a sound system that is superior to most of the rock clubs in this city.  When we were there a middle eastern band was tinkering around with their keyboards, stringed instruments and hand drums.  When they started paying later into our dinner I was pleasantly surprised.  They played middle eastern styled instrumental music that was not overbearing.    The food is awesome.  Pita bread is made on site and is light, warm and fluffy which is unlike the compressed dense pita that one gets at most mediterranean restaurants.  We were brought out an olive oil dip infused with herbs that went well with the pita.  For our dinner we ordered the fattouch salad, vegetarian plate and lamb kabob.  The fattouch salad was amazing with its' lemony tart dressing and crispy pita pieces.  My dining companion commented that it may have been a bit salty, but it did not detract from the salad at all.  The vegetarian plate was composed of falafel, hummus, tabouli, baba ganoush, dolmades, salad and a block of feta.  I think that the quality of hummus is always a good indicator of what the rest of the food will be like.  I dived right in with my pita and was impressed - it was light and creamy.  The Falafel were also excellent and tasted homemade as opposed to the mixes that other places use.   Usually I hate domades (stuffed grape leaves) - I've had too many bad ones in this town but these were really good.  Tabouli is also something that I am not usually too enthusiastic about but  Mijana's tabouli was fresh and delightful.  Everything on this plate was flavorful and made of excellent ingredients.  I've never sampled a feta so delectable.  The lamb kabobs were tender and succulent with a subtle charred taste.  I usually don't eat lamb, but this made we want to eat more of our wool bearing friends.  We really enjoyed our meal and hopefully will be back soon to check out some belly dancing.  Mijana has carved out an amazing space in this lonely strip of Tempe suburbia.",

    "text": "This is one of our favorite restaurants but it's not easily visible from Scottsdale Rd, so I worry that it won't get the attention it deserves.  The place is one giant open room with a huge amount of tables, a stage for a band, and a floor for dancing. There are three massive circular areas for parties, two of which are raised. But you could also have a party at the long tables that are in the center of the floor. There is a full-service bar.  Mijana is great for late night feasting and partying. They have Wednesday Salsa night. On other nights they have live bands and they bring in belly dancers. Men and ladies actually do get up and dance. The dance floor was packed the night we stayed there late enough for the dancing. The entertainment is scheduled to start around 9 but it doesn't usually get going until about 10, and they'll stay open as long as people want to party, usually until 1 or 2 am.  The food is amazing! This is a vegetarian's paradise, though there is plenty of meat. I'm vegan, but one of our meat-eating groups of friends that we brought loved the food. We brought a second group of meat-eaters who didn't care for the meat so much. The vegetarian plates are all amazing. From my point of view, the meat plates look rather boring, but I'm not the one to rely on for a meat review...  Our favorite dishes:   1) Moussaka - (eggplant with chickpeas, onions, green peppers, in an amazingly flavored sauce. AMAZING!  2) Eggplant Rehab - this is an eggplant dip with pita, cucumbers, and tomatoes plus other flavors. It's got a gooey texture and I hear that some Americans are turned off by the look and feel of it, but it's so flavorful. It's one of my favorites. People should get over their fear of goo and try this. Yum.  The pita is not like other pita you get at most places. It's the best. The hummus, babaganouj, falafal, and all the other vegetarian items are all so good. Vegans -- just make sure you tell them no tatsiki or feta cheese, etc.  One of the unusual things about this place is that it really doesn't start buzzing until 10 pm. At 10:00, Lebanese families start flooding in and that's when the party begins. Until about 9 or 10, you are likely to be the only people in the restaurant and if you don't know to expect it, you'll be shocked to see the place suddenly on fire after 10.  A couple other things: the owner is so friendly. He has never forgotten us since the first time we discovered his place. And the ambiance of the restaurant is great. It's very nice and there's a patio. The hookah vendor next door will even bring out the hookahs late at night on the weekends for you to smoke.  We've come for a quiet meal as a couple, we've come to party for my birthday -- and also just to party -- and we've brought our children. It's always good.",

When I pointed this out, my waitress said, \"The sign is old.\" She then took $4 off the bill, meant that one of the three dishes I had as 1/2 priced. This is simply dishonest business.  This is sad because I liked my meal. The quail and ful medames were very good and the kibbe was also good. The basket of pita was hot and fresh. Up until I got my check, I was satisfied.  To be fair, the manager did throw a gift card at me on my way out. A nice, if hollow, gesture (even with the gift card, I still paid more than the advertised price). I won't go back to a place that promises one price, charges another, then uses lame excuses to cover up their dishonesty. This wasn't just one bad waiter, the entire staff was dishonest.",

SO HAPPY we chose this place!  Staff- Extremely friendly! I loved how everyone worked together as a team. Our server was so helpful and took the time to describe the menu to us. She gave us really good recommendations because everything we ordered was really food. The owner was incredibly nice and checked up on us to make sure everything was good.   Food- DELICIOUS!!! We ordered a platter that gave us a variety of different things and everything was so good, It was also a perfect portion for 2 people! I really wish I had room for dessert  because it all looked so good.   Atmosphere- It is such a pretty restaurant, we sat on the patio because the weather was perfect! We sat inside for a bit to watch a belly dancing performance while we waited for our food. Our server told us she would come look for us to tell us when our food was ready so it wouldn't get cold (such a sweetheart)   My friend and I were only supposed to grab a bite to eat and head to Scottsdale around 10pm, and we didn't leave the restaurant until midnight because we were having so much fun!! We also hung out at the Hookah lounge right next door and ended up making some awesome friends by the end of the night.  Mijana, I will be seeing you soon! :) I recommend it to anyone who is wanting to try something new.",

    "text": "I was a guest of a friend who was hosting a family style dinner on Arabian night which included live traditional Arabic/Iraqi music and belly dancers.  I will start by saying although I was a guest; I was made to feel just like part of the family and was told I was going to have a great time, which I most certainly did. Our evening started with an Arabic serenade and the tempo progressed throughout the evening. Our dinner was family style so I didn't order off the menu which I was perfectly fine with. The Lebanese dinner included a salad, piles of pita bread, hummus, babaghanouj, dipping oils, a fried appetizer platter, Beef/ Chicken Shawarma and rice.  I enjoyed all the food and the host ensured my plate was constantly replenished which was a welcomed gesture.  I devoured every helping.   During dinner we were entertained by belly dancers who captivated the entire restaurant.  These dancers were quite talented and had everyone out of their seat dancing and throwing handfuls of money at them. It was magical.   Aside from the great entertainment, I was pulled out to the dance floor and participated in a traditional group dance- everybody was dancing in their traditional belly dancing style.  I had no reservations showing off my best Shakira inspired \"hips don't lie\" moves.  I fit right in.  After the dance, we all took a break to enjoy some Hookah out on the patio provided by Hookah Mania which is hip hookah lounge located next door. This wasn't a dream. It really happened.",

    "text": "Ordered delivery from here 3 times. The drivers and staff I've talked to have been very friendly, but as others have stated, I found the service to be dreadfully slow on 2/3 of my orders. As for the food, I really enjoyed it when it arrived. The fresh pita was great, and the rest of the food was good enough to order again. However, if I ever wanted Mijana again I would be traveling to the restaurant, rather than ordering delivery.",
