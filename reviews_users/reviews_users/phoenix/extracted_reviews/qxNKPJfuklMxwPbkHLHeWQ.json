It took a long time for the waitress to take our drink order. My boyfriend waited 20 mins to get his beer. After sometime we noticed tables around us had received complimentary bread, but none was offered to us. We had to ask. From the time we ordered our entrees it took us an hour to receive our meal. In this time a family of 4 was seated next to us. They ordered, received their meals and paid for their meals and we were still waiting. The food was not worth the wait. Our side salads were lettuce with approximately 5 grape tomatoes. The fish was over cooked. Our bill was very overpriced for the quality of food and service we received. We will not be returning or recommending this restaurant.",

Most of the servers uniforms were too small and their bellies were all hanging out. We received three thin slices for two people. Really chintzyh! The house dressing was so spicy our lips were on fire through the dinner. The chocolate ice cream was gritty! I didn't like it. The salt shaker was a paper salt shaker?? I'd spend the extra money and go to Chart House.",

When we sat down 6 olives and some almonds were placed on table for 8 people.  After we ordered meals 6 slices of bread were delivered.   Mushroom  soup served cold, French Dip is ok (better in New River) and Prime Rib is fatty with a pile of mashed potatoes.  The best was the salad, but it only had several varies of lettuce in it, but dressing was good.   Can find good salads in many other places close by,  will not recommend to friends.  Prices are on the high side even for Scottsdale.  Waiter was best part.  He knew the dishes and was attentive to needs.   He deserves a 4 or 5 for his service and the handicap he works with the quality and management.",

Service so incompetent, we had to flag down another member of the wait staff to take our order; so all we have on the table is water @ 1 hour after our reservation. When dinner finally arrived, we hit the trifecta. Reservation not honored, lousy service, and the piece de resistance, crappy food. Would of given a zero star rating if I could, so buyer beware.",

The only thing that I was a bit disappointed in was that the happy hour is only in the bar area and the bar is very small with a few 4 seat high tables and two community tables. I have never really been a fan of the community tables. But overall the experience was great and the food was yummy.",

    "text": "Ok before I get started, I should point out that my 2 star review is solely based on the length of time waiting for the main entree to arrive (to which Paul Martin DID make up for that!) Yes, this place is about 2 weeks old and some of the wait staff (at least where we were seated, on the patio) seemed to be very new.  No problem...I've been a newbie before too.  Our server was a little over the top with the constant mispronunciation of \"beautiful\", he kept saying \"bootiful\" and he kept reaching over us to remove empty dishes from the table; he just needs a little more training and seasoning and he'll be fine. The appetizer was a grill artichoke that we shared and it came with this great tasting garlic, pesto and basil aioli.  We devoured that in a short period of time. Next, we split the French Dip sandwich; the meat was a little too fatty and even though we split the dip, I mean c'mon Paul Martin, you can spare a decent amount of the au jus, can't 'cha??  The au jus was served in this way too small and too deep Japanese teacup-like container which it made it difficult to \"dip\" our French dip.  The horseradish/mayonnaise dip was creamy and good, pretty standard.  The shoestring fries was done well and crispy. We also had the mac and cheese that had pieces of prosciutto in it and it was a unique taste, the broiled top was nice and crunchy! With that being said, our wait time after we got the appetizer was way too long and appeared isolated however that is my biggest pet peeve is the food took too  long AND it seems that I am the one who has to recognize it and point it out to the staff.  Once I let the server know that it's taking a long time, it was then he let his manager know.  Manager addressed us and was nervous about approaching us (he seemed to be a young and new manager as well) and he did his best in explaining the situation but it was painful watching him stumble (ok, not so painful as amusing).   When the food did arrive, it did come out nice and hot so that was a plus!  They also comped our meal as a way of apologizing for the delay.   A golf clap for the food...and since they showed that in the end it is about customer satisfaction, we are going to try Paul Martin again.",

We had the kale Caesar salad, wild mushroom soup and the grilled salmon sandwich with sweet potato fries. Everything was great and very tasty. Service was also great. They accidentally served regular fries with the sandwich and they immediately apologized and brought out a basket of sweet potato fries. Definitely recommended and we will be back.",

Ordered a well whiskey and a glass of house cab, was surprised when the bill came that well whiskey is $12, I would hate to see what call liquor was priced at. Our waiter, Joe S, did not bring any bread to the table yet every other table we could see was getting it. We ordered the salmon, wife said it was dry and I had the cheese burger medium, it was way overcooked, brown all the way through. The mac and cheese also had some odd flavor to it. Waiter didn't come back to ask if we wanted another drink until we had finished eating, when he did I ask for a glass of water. He proceeded to bring a pitcher of water to the table and pour it in my empty whiskey glass??? The bus boy was the highlight of the evening, efficient, friendly, polite, he made the only good impression of the meal. Unfortunately no manager was available or I would have voiced my complaint while I was in the restaurant. Won't waste my time going back.",

Friend had burger and cheapest alternative was $13 but he says it was good. Both had salad which was good but on a hot plate. Excellent wine list by the glass though expensive. Beer list interesting but I didn't check prices. Good waiter and good assistants",

He explained Monday night was $49 wine/dinner night for two. We could pick ANY entree and any bottle of wine that had a box next to it. Along with that was two salads included. We were \"confused.\" HAHA We were excited that we stumbled onto such a great deal. We selected a bottle of AZ wine which cost more then the deal deal, but again, it was included! The salads were local, organic greens with champagne vinaigrette. Very fresh and nice size serving. We had the Chimichurri Hanger Steak that came with perfect shoestring fries and they were hot! Nice compliment to the perfectly cooked steak. We also tried the St Louis Style Ribs with corn on the cob. Ribs we tasty, not dry. The corn had a little too much cheese but it was good. The manager, Claude checked on us twice and we told him we would be back and how the service is impeccable and the food delish! There was also another manager who came by as well. They made sure our dining experience was a good one and it was. We will be back on a Monday. Best deal on town!",

I met my friend Gelie and we had a pleasant, leisurely, and filling experience.  As to be expected with any new restaurant, it seems that the hostess / front area is still working on greeting, seating, confirming reservations, etc... but the great thing is that PMAG seems to have a ton of staff, so I'm hoping they will all \"get it\" in due time.  Between Gelie and I, we tried the Chicken Tortilla Soup, the Kale Caesar salad, the Fish Tacos, the Mushroom Burger, and the Banana Cream Pie.  Nothing we had was to die for, but it was all tasty.  The service was attentive, ambiance comfortable, and I was pleased to see that despite being a chain (there are currently six California locations), they keep it local by using seasonal products from Valley farmers and purveyors including Black Mesa Ranch, Crow's Dairy Farm, Schreiner's, Hayden Mills, Queen Creek Olive Mill, and more... Their menu isn't overwhelming, but there's a decent amount to choose from.    When I return, I hope to try the artichoke appetizer and perhaps the Greek Salad with prawns and/or the Bistro Burger.  (Gelie and I actually missed that the Three Mushroom Burger we ordered was a mushroom patty and not a beef patty!)  We ate it anyways; who doesn't need more veggies?!  Paul Martin's took over the location where J Alexander's used to be... I hope they stick around for awhile!",

We so happened to stop at Paul Martin's for lunch and Clyde took great care of us from beginning to end- We knew this was a great place to bring our out of state friends and family. The day of the rehearsal dinner Clyde continued to take care of us and he made sure everything was perfect. We were so satisfied with the food and service that we continue to go back and bring the family to eat at Paul Martin's.",

Turned out to be longer than expected so he graciously set us up outside on a couch with drinks and appetizers. Not something you see much anymore. We sat down around 8::30. Our waiter was great and the manager made sure to check on us. My husband had the fish tacos and they were great! Drinks were always poured! We will be back in the future. Again, thanks to the restaurant for taking care of the longer wait.",

The manager addressed the table a couple of times, when is always a nice gesture.   I had the pork chop, which was phenomenal! After a couple of bites, I was sold on the salmon too! The banana creme pie was not worth all the hype. The bananas were brown and very mushy...not what I'm accustomed to. But all and all, Paul Martin's is a great place for a first date, to catch up with friends, or to unwind with your significant other. It tends to get pretty busy, so make reservations!",

My husband and I both ordered the Halibut as per recommendation from our waitress and she was spot on. I think this was the best halibut I have ever had. It was very lightly blackened in a light cream sauce surrounded by asparagus and grilled cherry tomatoes. The tomato's were sweet as sugar! The fish was cooked perfectly. I especially liked that there was no starch on the plate. I could have ordered it separately if I wanted. The service was great and we loved the atmosphere, definitely a place that you can bring the family. Not stuffy at all. I must say we will be returning soon!",

    "text": "MEDIOCRATY PERFORMED WITH AVERAGE PRECISION  After reading multiple reviews and hearing the buzz about Monday happy hours, this was the destination for a night out with the wife and good friends.  My wife and I arrived a good 20minutes early but our reserved table was free so the hostess sat us at the table instead of the bar.  We sat at the table a solid ten minutes before our server showed to offer a drink and app.  We figured that this delay was attributable to four menus/place settings but only two people.  At this point we informed the waiter that we intended to run a decent bar bill and take Uber home.  It was disappointing that the waiter did not really demonstrate any mastery of the wine list or even beers available so rather than trying new things we settled for standards and ordered the artichoke appetizer.  Drinks were prompt and our guests arrived as the appetizer showed.  The artichoke was flavorful with good grill char and nicely subtle mayo-based sauce.  But, the waiter forgot to take our guests' drink order.  I wanted to wash the oil from the artichoke off my hands so I got up and then tracked the waiter to order the women a bottle of wine and the men another round of porters.  When I returned the waiter was at the table with the vintner but wrong grape.  I had ordered a Chardonnay but he presented us a Pinot Noir.  At least he didn't open the bottle ahead of presenting it.  I wrote everything above as a draft over a month ago.  After seeing that I never completed it, I was faced with a choice to try and recall or delete.  I thought I would be True to the intent so I looked up the menu to refresh my memory of the meal.  That didn't work...which speaks to the so-so nature of the whole experience.",

Our meal was fabulous, the waiters were knowledgeable of their way variety menu and offered prompt service.  We began on dinner by ordering a bottle of their Cabinet listed on their Happy Hour menu. The wine was fabulous but I forget the name of the wine. I like wine but I nowhere near a wine expert.  After the wine was opened we order a dozen of the mixed oysters. The oysters were received with mixed review. Some types of oysters were definitely found more tasty than others.  I enjoyed a delicious bowl of mushroom soup. I love mushrooms and my bowl of soup did not disappoint- bravo to the chef for this delightful starter.  My husband and sister both were happy were their choice of salads.  My entree was a mouth watering generous portion of tasty ribeye surround by creamy mash potatoes. An entree of fresh salmon was inhaled by my husband and my sister took delight in each bite of her New York Steak. The New York Steak was served with favorable cauliflower. We finished our meal with three bailey's coffees and several desserts. I am usually not a big fan of ice cream for dessert but the sea salt caramel ice cream lingered with favor.  The meal came to a close and the bill arrived.  It was a pricey meal. However, every higher end restaurant is expensive. We all agreed the fabulous dinner was well worth the price. We will be back.  As a side note, the restaurant had a terrific vibe and good energy.",

My friend & I tried the Bistro Burgers (adding avocado and Arizona cheddar - a must).  As a fan of both Fleming's and Ruth Chris' burgers, I have found a new favorite burger in the valley!   Comes with fries (get the sweet potato - perfectly cooked and very flavorful).  Or try the house-made coleslaw - amazing.  We added a side of grilled corn with chilli aoli & cotija cheese - the description alone should tempt you...and it delivers big on flavor.    Capped it off by sharing a piece of the Devil's Food Cake - added a scoop of vanilla ice cream per server's recommendation - thanks Michelle! perfect compliment to the rich dark chocolate ganache in the cake.  Will be back soon!",

They're full portions and a full sized beer too. The food is always outstanding and after talking to the waitress about their food I found out that everything is fresh and made in house. The only freezer they have is for the ice cream that they made!  Besides the burger I also highly recommend the street tacos and everything on their dessert menus is absolutely delicious.",

    "text": "After visiting this stylish new restaurant three times I was disappointed in the food three times.   First time: After struggling to find anything on the menu that appealed to me, I ordered the fish tacos.  I was surprised to see the tacos made with Salmon.  If I wanted Salmon I would have ordered Salmon.  They were just ok but,  not what I had hoped for.  Second time:  I ordered a hamburger.  It was difficult to cut it in half as I hit on a very tough piece of meat.  Then, when I was eating it, I bit on a tough piece that I could not chew so I had to spit it out.  Lost my appetite for the rest of the meal.  Third time: Got to be better this time right??  I odered Tortilla Soup.  Huge  disappointment.  The bowl was small, there were VERY few pieces of chicken but, one the the pieces was a chunk of fat that had to  be spit out!!  Summary:  Disappointed in the food,  prices too high, happy hour below average. Many better restaurnants in town.  Paul Flemming.....how did you miss on this one?  My recommendation:  For great Tortilla Soup  go to  Roaring Fork.  For all other food, you can't go wrong at Houston's.  Nan",

Steaks were undercooked or not cooked to patrons specification.  It can be irritating for some but for this type of establishment that presents itself as above average. I cannot give it more than an average review. My dish was great but other people at my table were not that satisfied.",

    "text": "Upscale American bar and grill scene right in Scottsdale. Came with a group of friends on a Friday night and for good reason place was packed. We decided to start off with the Calamari which was prepared  Rhode Island's style which was lightly breaded with a chili aioli and a house cocktail sauce and also the salt and pepper shrimp cocktail. The shrimp cocktail was prepared perfectly which on the menu said lightly fried which you couldn't tell. Was not overly impressed with the sauce that came with the calamari. For my meal I decided on the on the brick chicken dish which came with mashed potatoes, Za'atar croutons, herb jus chicken dish which came with very juicy and sauce was even better. Other people in my group decided on the French dip with fries and the fries were regular string cut but a little bit well done and were great. Other people in the group decided on the filet which was the most tender well prepared meal of the group. This would be my suggestion if you decided to venture here in the future definitely try the filet..",

    "text": "This was our first experience here, and we will not be going back. The hostess was very rude when we arrived a few minutes before our reservation, and wasted no time in telling us so--we had intentionally arrived early to have a cocktail at the bar as we often do. We ordered a Cosmo and a raspberry martini which were average. When our table was ready, we were sat, and greeted rather promptly, by a friendly waitress.  She was the highlight of our experience with perfectly timed table visits and just the right amount of humor and friendliness.  We ordered the marinated bone in pork chop cooked to medium and a 7 oz filet cooked medium rare, with Brussels sprouts, sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes on the side. When our food came out, the runner asked us to cut in to our entrees \"to make sure they were cooked correctly\" while he stood and watched. I have never experienced that st any other restaurant, and we were immediately concerned. My husbands pork was slightly over cooked, but he chose to keep it. My steak was cooked medium well, and so I sent it back asking for a new one. In the meantime, he ate his entree and we shared the potatoes, which were way, way over salted (even for me who would prefer something slightly over seasoned than under)  It took about 25 minutes for a new steak to arrive, by which time my husband had long since finished his entree. Again I was asked to cut in to it while the manager observed. It was cooked medium rare this time, but in the time it took for them to correct their mistake,  I was full from the mashed potatoes. They did end up comping the steak (rightly so), however the whole meal was an overall disappointment. With as many restaurants as there are in Phoenix and Scottsdale with a similar menu/price point, Paul Martin's needs to step up their game.",

I had to tell him I never received my entree and it still took quite a while and came out burned! I had ordered the Nashville chicken sandwich, and the menu didn't say it was fried. Had I known that i wouldn't have ordered it. Waiter took it off the bill but really didn't seem concerned that it came out so late. We didn't leave a very generous tip which is unusual for us.

Asked about seating indoors, but told due to our reservations we could only be outdoors due to them being so booked for NYE. Got seated in a very cold patio area in folding chairs while looking at very comfortable chairs at other tables on the same patio. We understood, but watched empty indoor restaurant the entire time we dined. Was a good half hour before anyone asked if they should turn up the heat for us.  Drinks were good, wedge salad delicious, french onion soup was quite sweet (should be described in menu - would not have ordered at that price), spinach artichoke dip tastey, then came entrees. Short ribs were cold, sent them back to be reheated, other person in party ordered ribs, they were cold as well. They chose not to send back but just packaged them up in to go box. Third person said breading on fried chicken took a lot to get through before getting to the meat, said it was just ok. Will not be returning next trip. Wish we would have read other recent reviews about cold food.",

Though it does kind of look like some other overpriced and stuffy steakhouse establishments, the atmosphere, experience, and quality were top notch.   I came with a large group, and they gave us the banquet room, which was the perfect balance between private and public. They made us feel special from start to finish.   The wine list seemed to please everyone who was into wine. And many of their bottles are actually on cask, so be prepared for your bottle to come without a label. I was more concerned with the beer list, which had anchor steam and hop nosh from uinta. Very impressive for a place like that.   My dinner was a stocked salad with julienned veggies and chicken. A huge serving that could be split between two less hungry people. Others in my group ordered the brick chicken, steak, and some other American standards.   Then came dessert: white chocolate pistachio and chocolate ice cream I believe was house made. Did not disappoint.   Overall a great place to spend an evening being taken care of and eating delicious food.",

I contacted the restaurant and Anthony was willing to accommodate our party of 18 but gave us a limited window which I knew would work. Well, to my surprise, a couple of more people decided to join us as we were celebrating one of our managers at work. As we were unable to seat everyone together, a few of us decided to dine inside. Again, Anthony being very accommodating, was able to place us at a table and that's where John came in. He was very sweet, engaging and an all around great guy. John continued to ensure we were happy, had everything we need and checked on us regularly for there to have been a packed house. The service alone will get me back in the door but it doesn't hurt that the food was quite tasty as well! And yes you want the $17 crab cake. Trust me. :)",

    "text": "I'm so disappointed.  I was looking forward to our reservation here for a nice Christmas Eve meal with my family, six in our party.  They kept the doors open, so I was cold the entire time.  I couldn't take my coat off.  Two of us ordered the most expensive thing on the menu, their special Filet mignon with crab stuffed bacon wrapped shrimp.  We discussed with the waitress what medium was.  It was pink.  We were asked to cut into our steaks and they were very red.  The server returned them to be cooked longer.  When they came back, they were still red.  Well, I kept mine because I was frustrated with the fact that the rest of the party was eating their burgers and chicken without us.  So I ate as much as I could of my raw 45.00 steak and that was about half of an 8 oz. filet, but my daughter sent hers back again and it was still very under cooked, another words it was bloody after two attempts.  They said they would \"take care of it\".  My hubby ordered the fried chicken.  Several pieces of big chicken nuggets came to him and two were burnt.  Come on Paul, the chicken was not juicy and tender, it was really tough and unpleasant for comfort food.  Then we noticed that my grandson never got his Mac and Cheese.  Oh, sorry.  We'll have that right out.  Too bad they didn't tell us it would be tough and dry, (and where was the cheese?)  we would have saved them the trouble.  Any way, the check came and they did not take care of it, at least not until we explained we were told it would be taken care of.  Over all it was a terrible experience for $300.00 plus.  Later my daughter asked me what I thought of the crab stuffed shrimp and I said one of them tasted like it had a bite of crab and one didn't.  She said hers were cold because of all the rigamoral with the steak, they didn't even bother to make the meal hot, just brought out the shrimp that sat waiting for a the steak that they couldn't get right.  Medium, about 6 minutes on each side, I do it all the time on my grill at home, which is where I wish we had been.",

But the food tho! The food is either under-cooked or over overcooked or oversalted or too sweet etc. Some of their items are actually even weird... We ordered spinach dip and were provided with a soupy cheese mixture with fresh spinach not even cut up floating in the soup. In other words, in order to eat the spinach dip you had to use a knife. Who needs a knife to eat spinach dip?  The taste was fine but it was weird. Other things I have had that I was not impressed with include the artichoke (if you want a real artichoke go to Houston's) and the cedar plank salmon (barely cooked). However, I ordered the short rib dinner the first time I was there and that was quite good. Besides that, everything has been somewhere between bad and meh.",

Made reservations for 3 on a Friday night without any trouble via Open Table. Inside and out, the only difference between the current decor and that from J. Alexander's is the name on the door! Seems like exact same store.  Food was good. No one had any complaints but wasn't blown away either. I had a rib eye and spinach for $36. Wasn't especially good, and was too salty but it wasn't tough and was prepped as I asked.   Overall I feel like this is another restaurant typically found in Scottsdale; a little over priced not great food served in a nice atmosphere. I suppose I'd eat here again but if I had to choose between this place and Roaring Fork, RF would win every time.",

Cocktails were 10 dollars each, not bad, but didn't really taste too good. nothing special.  Servers were unpolished. Felt like they were all newly hired.  Food was not that good. New York Strip Steak was a small portion. Tasted all right, but not nearly enough for a young man. Asked for medium rare but got it medium. Wife ordered medium sandwich but got rare. Had to send it back (after waiting for 10 minutes).   Overall, came out to 40 a pop, but was a lackluster meal.",

    "text": "The most important place to start: There is a restaurant that has been across the street for a long time with a great record serving up a very similar menu and doing it better. If you have been to this place I speak of across the street, and you like it, don't go to Paul Martin's.   This is a new location for an already established restaurant group, for that reason I do not allow the excuse of being new in regards to our not so great service. While our waitress was nice, she just wasn't very good. If I ask you what items are good on the menu don't tell me what people have been ordering a lot of that night. It doesn't answer my question. A restaurant like this should have had all their employees do a complete tasting of their menu.   After lack of guidance my husband and I collectively wound up with the spinach dip, mushroom soup, steak cobb salad and the short ribs. The meal itself started with olives from the Queen Creek Olive Mill and some seasoned almonds. We enjoyed those and thought we were headed on the path of a good meal, but not so much. Next our waitress brought us \"complimentary\" bread. She kept saying \"complimentary \". It was weird, pretty sure everyone eating at that restaurant understands when the bread hits the table you don't have to pay for it. Anyhow, it wasn't very good bread.   Next should have been our spinach dip but that took 25 minutes so my soup showed up first. It would have actually been very good but half the bowl was filled with a chunk of that not so great bread wedged into my soup. Finally the \"spinach dip\" came. Ok, if you have had that aforementioned restaurant's spinach dip, DO NOT ORDER THIS. It was whole leaves of spinach that were wilted in a runny bechamel sauce. Not only was the flavor lacking but it was hard to eat since it was whole leaves of spinach. Don't waste your time or money on that one.  The last round for us was my salad and my husband's short ribs. My salad was ok, not bad - but nothing to write home about. The price for what you were getting left something to be desired though. My husband's short ribs were a little bit of short ribs and 20 potatoes worth of mashed potatoes. Guess they make sure their margins are good on that dish. But the biggest issue there was the \"sauce\". The meat itself was very tender but the plate was like soup with a broth made of soy sauce with meat floating in it. This quantity of soy sauce made the short ribs SO over salted. Short ribs have become very popular on many restaurant menus lately and these were probably my least favorite out of many I've tried lately.   One of the most important things to note here, the bathrooms were FILTHY. I always find it concerning when cleanliness is not a priority in any part of a restaurant.   Final statement: go across the street.",

Their meat is also humanely raised. You can taste and feel the difference. America needs more places like this and we need to support them.",

They have a wonderful deal on Monday nights (called Monday night wine dinner) and you get two organic salads, two entrees (any entree on the menu) and a bottle of wine (good selection) for $49!!  In addition, their Happy Hour is wonderful!  The staff is cordial and friendly (we like that in Scottsdale) AND they use local ingredients where they can.  What's not to love?",

Definitely trying to give off a higher end vibe, which is fine, I appreciate great fine dining service! But they don't even have to go that fancy with the service, the food seriously speaks for itself and is wonderful. We had the spinach dip to start which was fantastic and the best I've had. It came with delicious slices of bread and sun dried tomato. Fiance had the short rib, a perfect portion size and delicious. I ordered the steak cobb with a side of mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was great, I wouldn't say I need it but it was definitely tasty. The salad on the other hand was so beautiful in presentation and I loved every bite. I didn't even use the blue cheese dressing they brought on the side. The vinaigrette it is tossed in is perfect.   Service could not have been better- our waters were never empty, servers were attentive while not being annoying or overbearing and the ambiance is quiet. You can get away with being both casual and dressy here.  I highly recommend Paul Martins for Lunch or Dinner. The servers are excellent and the food top notch.",

It was, by far, the best mushroom soup I have ever tasted. The table next to us said the same thing. Then I had the brick chicken (swoon) and hubby had the smoked pastrami sandwich. He is STILL talking about it. Instead of fries, he opted for brussel sprouts and I thought he was going to lick the plate. The service and ambiance are a cut above.

    "text": "I just got back from Paul Martin's American Grill and I can honestly say I have never received worse service at a restaurant.  My wife, 8-year-old son and I were on an extended stay at a nearby hotel and decided to try one of the many well-reviewed restaurants in the area and decided on Paul Martin's.  I don't know who he is, but the place seemed clean, trendy and modern.  We had to wait about 20 minutes, which was okay. The dining area was pretty busy, and the Mexican place next door was also packed.  Our hostess was very nice.  Our waitress arrived promptly, took our drink order and then our food order.  She told us we'd be getting some bread and then she disappeared until we were almost done with our meal.  Well, \"disappeared\" is an exaggeration - she was still in the restaurant, she just studiously ignored us.  Our son's meal arrived fairly quickly, but after that, we waited (sans the promised bread), and waited... And waited.  Our meals came, and we had to ask the waiter  for the bread we had never received before.  For the life of me, I can't figure out why they brought our son's food out a good half hour before the rest of the table's dinner was ready.   A third staffer then inexplicably replaced my Diet Coke with iced tea.  Our original waitress eventually showed up again, we asked for the check and left.  The food itself was hit or miss.  My wife reports her steak was very good.  My own blackened redfish, however, was chewy and not very flavorful.  Although my son complained that his grilled cheese was not what he was expecting, I tried it and thought it was very good.  Portions were a bit on the small side, but that is almost expected at a trendy place like this.    And the bread, when it eventually came, was also very good.   We could see other tables getting good service (i.e., the wait staff actually paid attention to them and were laughing and smiling). Our waitress, on the other hand, was determined not to even look in our direction.    The only reason I can think of that we received so little attention is that our son was with us.  I didn't see any other children in the place, but it didn't seem that kids were unwelcome and he was well-behaved the entire time.  I must confess, I still don't know who Paul Martin is, but I know we will be staying within walking distance of his restaurant for another 2-4 weeks and we will not be back.  Had our experience been different, we may have eaten there several more times during our stay.  But our first impression was so bad, that we will not be giving him another chance.",

Our server was in training but he did an excellent job, more of the reason why I give it 4 stars is because the service was prompt and server kept us very well informed and knowledgable about the menu. Love also that everything is made from scratch and in house.   We started our night of with a glass of wine each, I was very impressed with their wine list and also how their selection of by the glass was quite extensive than most steak houses. We had the seafood platter as our appetizer. Came with fresh oysters, shrimp, lobster, and a salmon spread lettuce wrap. Very tasty, however the portions were VERY small for the price you are paying. I had the cedar plank salmon as my meal, it was good but could have been better. The sauce was very runny which made the presentation look very sloppy and salmon could have been cooked better. My friend had the rib eye steak, it looked amazing and friend said it was tasty. Had a piece of the broccolini it had as a side and loved it.  For desert we tried the raspberry crem brulee and it may have been my favorite part of the meal. Cooked perfectly and moist.   With 2 glasses of wine later and a $200 tab we would say we enjoyed our dinner. Food would review as 3-3.5 but gave it 4 stars because of the ambiance of the place and great service.",

    "text": "So my mom told me about this place and insisted we get happy hour together there, and when my mom likes a restaurant, it's kind of a big deal because she's pretty picky. My boyfriend and I met my parents there for happy hour the other week. It's wonderful that the HH goes until 8PM because my boyfriend works late so he was finally able to make it to a HH!   We got to sit out on the patio in the comfy cushioned chairs. I really need to remember to start writing down our servers' names because he was fantastic.   We ordered from the \"Taste of Paul Martin's Menu\" which is their way of saying Happy Hour. My boyfriend ordered the St. Louis Style Pork Ribs and I ordered the $13 special which comes with a burger (there's 3 choices available), fries (sweet potato, regular, or mixed), and a beer...all for $13!! The burger was very very yummy and incredibly juicy.   Not one of us left a scrap of food on our plates. I had a chance to check out their full menu and it looks like a place I definitely want to come back to and try out.   Happy hour = fantastic. Full dining experience = forthcoming.",

And ruined it by smothering it in onions and spinach. I thought the spinach and onions were going to be a side dish. If salmon is farm raised or Atlantic then it does need extra work to get a good flavor, but WA or AK fish is outstanding with just a bit salt and pepper, cedar plank or fresh lemon. It does not need a lot to have excellent flavor.",

It took the waiter far longer than it should have to retrieve our drink order. The drinks remained empty without an offer for refills.  We shared the butcher's board - a selection of local cheeses and artisan salumes - it seemed subpar and overpriced.  Our dinner entrees were about the same. Nothing special.  For all the hype this place really didn't have the \"it\" factor for me.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place.  We showed up around 6:00 pm for their advertised \"Taste of Paul Martin's\" happy hour menu.  I asked the hostess if it mattered where we sat for that menu.  Well, it did.  You have your choice of the high-top tables around the perimeter, the communal tables (like picnic tables with people packed in like sardines) or the bar.  As she pointed out, they were all full.   So I asked if we could be put on a waiting list.  No, they don't do that.  I asked if we could have made a reservation.  They don't do that either.  So, I said, \"so what are we supposed to do, stand in front of a table & wait until the people leave?\"  And the answer, shockingly, was unfortunately that's pretty much what you have to do.  She was sorry that was how it is, but that's how  it is.  So if a table opens & there are others waiting, whoever can run the fastest gets the table?  Is this any way to run a business of any kind, let alone a restaurant in Scottsdale?  We were also offered the outside patio, which NO one was sitting at.  Why, you might ask?  Because it's August and it's 106 degrees out and they don't even have any misters.  I am not that desperate to eat in their establishment.  We waited for a little while and realized it was a total waste of a trip & waste of time, so we left.  We will not be returning.  I have a feeling if I had not asked about the seating for the happy hour menu, we would have not been told and then been up-sold to their \"dinner menu\" and probably would have still ended up leaving anyway.  I would love to hear anyone else's experience with their happy hour seating.",

    "text": "I don't understand what all the hype is about with Paul Martin's...I'd like to give it 2.5 stars, but rather than round up, I'm rounding down. Looking beyond the really nice decor and well done interior remodel of the restaurant formerly known as J. Alexander's, everything else seemed very lack luster.  I made a call to get a group of three on the waiting list on a Friday night, and the hostess almost seemed confused at my request. When we arrived, we were told that the hostess only had marked us down for a group of two...alright, no big deal, an honest mistake I guess. There was about a 20 minute wait so we decided to get some drinks at the bar. It was pretty crowded, but the bartender was fairly dismissive and not overly friendly upon our arrival, just a quick delivery of the menu and \"what will you be drinking?\"..hmm okay.  When we got the text message that our table was ready, the same absent minded hostess sat us, and only brought two menus. I'm not sure what the deal was, but we clearly had a party of three, c'mon now! When our server arrived, he was kind enough to offer a smile and a proper greeting. We ordered the bruschetta appetizer right away and had our drink order placed. When he came back over, he spieled the specials for the night - and REALLY emphasized the new bruschetta, which we had already ordered. At this point, the series of service miscues were almost laughable to us and we figured we were already there so let's just roll with the punches.  Entrees came out, and my girlfriend had the steak cobb salad which was good, her mom had the polenta which was fine, and I had the New York French Dip which is their \"twist\" on a prime rib shaved sandwich. It instead has shaved New York strip on it and I must say, I was completely underwhelmed by the flavor of the sandwich - just bland, bland, bland.  Honestly, I know I'm ranting and raving in this review, but it was a totally mediocre experience. It is amazing what a remodel can do to a restaurant, as it was pretty full and seemed more lively than when J. Alexander's was the occupant, but I don't think the food is any better - in my opinion, its not even as good and the service is definitely not up to par.   Maybe I'll give Paul Martin's a second chance, but I'll keep my regularity and loyalty to Houston's and Hillstone for my All-American cuisine fix.",

    "text": "I want so bad to give this place five stars. It has some really great things going for it. I've now eaten here twice: once for their happy hour and once for their $49 wine dinner. Now here's the good:  - service: both the bartender for the happy hour and our server at dinner were wonderful. No complaints.  - food: very good. Loved the salad the meal came with. Cedar plank salmon and poke were also good.  - price: amazing. You can't beat the $49 wine dinner.  Now the reason why I only give this place three stars:  - AC: my sister and I were both dripping sweat throughout our dinner. It was way too hot in the dining room. Even our server was like, \"PLEASE complain to the manager.\" She was obviously hot too.Unfortunately, no matter how good the food is, it's hard to enjoy while dripping sweat. The manager did come over and apologize and give us free scoops of ice cream, but we had just had a slice of pie, which brings me to...  - Banana Cream pie: I did not like it. The custard was super thin and tasted of artificial banana flavor like a banana runt. Do they add some kind of banana extract?? Ick. Also didn't love the whipped cream. Had a little fridgy flavor to it, like it had been sitting for a while. I really wish the manager had just comped the pie instead of giving us ice cream we were too full to eat because I felt slightly resentful about spending $10 on that not so great piece of pie. The fact that we shared it and left some on the plate says a lot. Neither of us enjoyed it very much.  - I do wish they had a better selection of beer and a salad on the happy hour menu, but that's not a big deal.  -Parking: parking is difficult and they basically force you to valet. It's free, but I still prefer to just self park.  Will I go back? Yes, I believe I will. The food and service really are good. I hope for a five star experience next time. And also air conditioning.",

    "text": "Bad. Just plain bad, especially for the price.  Food:  Appetizers Spinach dip- gross. Honestly disgusting. Most spinach dip is thick with melted cheese, cream, chopped spinach, etc. This was whole pieces of spinach in what seemed to be Campbells cream of (?) soup and some melted cheese on top. Comes with bread, not a dipping appetizer, I had to use a spoon to ladel some onto my bread.  Cheese board: pretty good. Nice variety of cheeses and meats, though it did not come with any additional bread or crackers. They price it at $12/person, which is weird and a little confusing (does each person have to pay $12 or can you just order one \"person\" for the whole table?). The latter is True and we ordered 2 \"people\" for 5 of us and it was enough.   Calamari: my favorite part of the meal. Fried really nicely and great flavor.  Entrees Prime new York steak: $42. Absolutely not worth $42. I ordered MR and it came medium. Did not taste like a high quality steak. Came with spinach with no flavor and fried potatoes which were the best part of the plate.  French dip: OK but not great. Fairly juicy but not what i would expect from a restaurant like this. The horseradish had the consistency of ranch and did not have much flavor. Fries were very good.  Short rib: very juicy. No real complaints but it didn't blow me away.   Two others ordered fish plates which I did not try. However both were swimming in some sort of juice/sauce and neither person finished their plate.  Dessert Chocolate cake: solid. Chocolate lovers dream  Drinks: Bloody Mary: spicy (good for me) but it was very thin looking and lacked flavor. Even my wife (who hates BM's) mentioned that it looked thin  Margarita: terrible. It was just sweet and sour and silver tequila. No gran marnier or orange juice or anything that resembled fresh juice. Supposedly the sweet and sour is made in house, but its a very poor recipe if that's True.   Service: Complete garbage for the prices they charge. We waited 5 minutes (at least) from the time we sat until anyone greeted us and took drink orders. Another 5 minutes or so to actually get drinks. Then probably 15 minutes before he came back to get our food orders, by then we just ordered our food an appetizers together.   The servers dont seem to help each other out much either. Each time food and drinks were brought to the table, our server had to make 2 trips.   Drink refills were relatively slow, but not terrible. Table management was awful. My margarita glass was empty after 15 minutes and then sat on the table for the rest of the meal until we stood up. One ordered wine but her wine glass was still removed from the table (prior to being served her first glass). When he brought the wine he had to go back to get another glass.   Overall we were there for 2 hours. Will never go back. If you want to pay the same amount for dinner but get a quality meal and excellent service, go across the street. If you want to get the same service and food but don't want to pay the $$$, go to....any chain restaurant of your choice.",

The service was not awesome even though there were only 6 tables full. We had to consistently wait for service and grab a different waiter at times. However, I would still recommend for the food.",

The moment we sat down our waiter rushed us. We eventually order cocktails and our Meals. Everyone in our group of 9 ordered a salad or soup. My wife and daughter had only finished 1/4 if their soup and the waiter brought out our meals.  Embarrassed my family asked if they could have to go containers for their soups.  Someone did mention they were sorry for bringing out everything so quick and then walked away. We ordered two bottles of wine and didn't even have a chance to finish them with our dinner.  Enjoy our food even though we were rushed till the very end. Service was about a bad as I have ever experienced.  No need to return",

Stephen was our waiter and the service was great. My wife had the grill salad and I enjoyed the French Onion soup. The soup was very good, no big chunk of floating bread and a little sweeter than most, but a very nice flavor. The salad was good and had avocado in it along with cherry tomatoes.   We both had halibut. We agreed it was very good, but not the best halibut that we have ever had. The sauce was nice and light, somewhat lighter than we expected but that was probably a good thing for our diets. My wife thought the halibut was a little overcooked, mine was fine in my opinion. The accompanying asparagus was good, not the giant thick asparagus you see at so many steakhouses.   Great atmosphere, nice wine, and very good food. We've already made reservations for next Monday.",

Our party of 4 was quickly attended to by James. I would say we were a little on the \"needy\" side. We kept James running with drink, bread & appetizer needs. Love their \"Team\" service....when James couldn't get to us ( he also was working a party of 12) others were there to clear plates, fill water etc... We had a fantastic meal-steak for me (perfectly done). After dinning we were enjoying our conversations as we are all great friends that had not seen each other in a while. Growing up & working in the Biz.....I should have noticed they needed the table ( i didn't). We were approached by the Manager -Anthony who very deftly & Professionally explained the the situation of needing the table for a large reso. He moved us to a bar table smoothly & efficiently & our conversations did not miss a beat. While I could not make this an affordable go out for a bite to eat restaurant, I would definitely make a special place to go. Well done Staff.....very impressed!",

However, there's a lovely ambiance once you walk in, and perhaps what helped it to stand out was the wide variety of fresh, locally sourced, organic dishes on the menu. We had reservations, which helped make the wait shorter... it was very crowded, always a good sign. Shannon was our server, and she was great; her friendly personality and eagerness to get us whatever we needed helped to enhance our experience. I got the Meyer Lemon Drop drink which was good. For meals, I started with the Butter Lettuce Salad with blue cheese, candied walnuts, apples, and maple vinaigrette. Very tasty and light enough to be an appetizer. For my main dish, I got the Vegetable Pasta. I was apprehensive about the vague \"seasonal vegetables\" that it came with, but was pleasantly surprised to find butternut squash, mushrooms, and lemony greens. Great flavor and very filling. Both dishes were delicious. Yum! We got dessert to-go as we were all full. The apple crisp and chocolate cake were both great. Give Paul Martin's a try! Not your average American grill.",

    "text": "If every restaurant could take a lesson from Paul Martin's on how to perfect the quality of food and customer service, bad Yelp reviews wouldn't exist. I am writing this review on a full stomach of delicious cuisine, but it was more than just good food. It was the excellent experience in general.   First off, they accept reservations which is a huge plus during the busy season. We made a reservation and upon arrival, we were seated right away. From the moment we sat down until the moment we left, it was a pleasant experience. Our waiter Jeremy is 50% responsible for the great experience. He greeted us as if we were personal VIP guests of Paul Martin's American Grill (which we were not, just random customers). He was incredibly knowledgeable and educated us on the brand, food and history of Paul Martin's. I had no idea this restaurant is a concept of and owned by Mr. Fleming of Fleming's Steakhouse. All of their food is made in-house from scratch and much of it is sourced locally form Arizona. I gained so much knowledge in such a short period of time, without ever feeling like I was being talked at. It was just friendly conversation by Jeremy who is truly passionate about Paul Martin's and it shows.   Jeremy pointed us in the right direction with everything we ordered and I'm glad we took his advice! We started with the calamari which is not your average rubbery calamari. No, this is cod calamari and it seriously puts any other calamari to shame. The seasonings and freshness of the dish made it taste so good I didn't want the dish to end. We almost didn't get it at first because we figured it would just be like every other calamari we had, but we were definitely wrong.   For dinner, I had the short ribs and mashed potatoes, thanks to Jeremy's suggestion. The meat was tender, juicy and flavorful with each and every bite. The mashed potatoes were just as amazing as the short ribs themselves. For dessert, I gobbled up several bites of the pear and huckleberry cobbler which was delectable to the core and topped with their homemade ice cream.   Between the combination of excellent service from Jeremy and delicious food from Paul Martin's, I'd say this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in awhile. I just wish we had given this restaurant a try much earlier! Now we will definitely find our way back again soon.   PS   - They offer brunch on the weekend for just $14 for a pre-fixe menu. I can't wait to try it!",

Of all the menu items we have tried, the mesquite grilled artichoke, mushroom soup, kale Caesar salad and Brick Chicken are our favorites. You should also save room for any of the deserts!  Tip: many of the menu items are available on the lunch menu for a few dollars less.  Go for a late lunch and call it an early dinner!",

    "text": "Thought food was good. Had dinner with my brother who does not like cheese. He ordered a Cobb salad and emphasized no cheese. Unfortunately there was blue cheese in his salad. Which blue cheese for cheese  haters has to be the worst cheese you could possibly eat. When presented the blue cheese to the waiter the waiter said no its Egg so he tried tasting it and in fact it was blue cheese. He asked for another salad and unfortunately there was also blue cheese in that salad. When my brother told the waiter he said no its not blue cheese. So we asked to speak to the manager and the manager came over and said \" no sir it's not blue cheese i asked the chef\". Clearly that's the worst thing you could tell a customer that what they tasted was not correct. So the manager asked \"so what do you want me to do\" so we told him nothing and ask him to leave. Worst thing you can ever tell a customer.",

We specifically chose this place for the prime rib, unfortunately they did not have it despite offering this dish as their feature choice. We were offered an alternative for a significantly higher price. But it was not the price hike that we felt offended by, it was the condescending nature of the manager, we felt very uncomfortable and embarrassed that we even asked for a price match. This reason alone is why we thanked the server and left. I can handle bad food, but bad service is unacceptable.  I want to add the we went across the street to Fleming's and they did not have prime rib either, but they immediately offered an alternative with sides for the same price! We never asked, they offered it to us. They gave us the desert when we mentioned it was our anniversary and the server and the manager gave us a $50.00 gift card and a gift wrapped box full of chocolates!  Simply Amazing!",

How can you beat $25 for a salad, a large piece of prime rib with mashed potatoes, and homemade ice cream? They also have a Monday night wine dinner (great deal!!) and a fried chicken Tuesday which I've heard is also very good!  The atmosphere is very nice-beautiful wood beamed high ceilings with fresh orchid arrangements and very comfy booths with dim lighting. The staff is top notch and the entrees are great.  we've had the chimichurri steak (yummy and garlicky!) the free range chicken-small portion but equally as tasty, the marinated skirt steak is cooked perfectly and very tender...the street tacos are pretty good as well if you want an appetizer.

The Prime New York Strip was so tender I used my fork to cut it. The short Rib was good but it  tasted reminiscent of a pot roast. The most notable change this visit was the service. Our server was very attentive and the support staff was a little overly aggressive while bussing our table. I was chewing my last bite, fork in hand  and someone appeared to take my plate.

The atmosphere is dark, elegant, yet cuddly, just like I like it! We had reservations so we got sat as soon as we arrived.  The service here was AWESOME. Best service I have had so far. Our server answered any questions we had, offered suggestions on the menu and was very knowledgeable, and checked on us regularly. Then, there were server assistants/runners/bussers/whatever you call them that would come by and take your dirty plate and made sure you had a new clean plate and clean silverware. At one point I remember just barely setting my plate down and someone magically appeared out of no where and removed my dirty dish. WOW! Okay enough about the stellar service. Let's talk food.  We did the whole shebang. I ordered a glass of Educated Guess (Cabernet Sauvignon) and my friend ordered a cocktail (forgot which one). As an appetizer, we tried the Butcher's Board. YAY! Cheese and meat! It was a very neat experience trying the different things on the board. We finished that and out came our entree's. I ordered the Prime New York Steak with a side of mac and cheese. (I'm drooling and I haven't even begun to explain the heavenly flavor). So, my meat came with pt. reyes blue cheese butter. It was delicioso! The mac and cheese was bomb. The meat was EXACTLY how I ordered it: medium. It was so tender and juicy! My friend ordered the blackened ribeye with mac and cheese. He said his was amazing as well. He ordered dessert to go but I didn't try any because I was full. I bet it was amazing, though.  This place is a little bit pricy but it was worth it. Everything was beyond anything I've ever had. When this college kid can save up some more money she will definitely return.",

I tried some really delicious dishes on a recent happy hour visit to the restaurant, which, like I discovered on my first lunchtime visit to the restaurant, I love for its relaxed yet classy atmosphere and exceptional service.  The restaurant uses local produce in its dishes, which made eating vegetarian items like the Castroville Artichoke with pesto aioli ($13) and Wild Museum Soup ($9) so enjoyable.  Eating a large artichoke is always a little hard to handle, but it's also a lot of fun, especially when it's tasty and mesquite-grilled like this one. It was a really great vegetarian option that was perfect for two people, and I loved the smoky qualities of the dish.  The mushroom soup was so delicious, with six types of wild mushrooms, including white shimeji, brown shimeji, maitake and king trumpets. Every bite was a mouth full of mushrooms, which I loved, and this was a thick, hearty soup I would definitely recommend.  The new cocktails (all $12) that accompanied the meals were also delicious. My friend and I loved the Makers Mark Manhattan, with Makers Mark whisky and sweet vermouth and garnished with a Luxardo cherry. It was strong and sweet and had a great holiday spice.  The Ketel One Moscow Mule is also always a great choice, as is the Meyer Lemon Drop, made with house-infused Meyer lemon vodka.  We had to try the delicious new Apple Cinnamon Crisp ($10), which came topped with vanilla ice cream that made every warm bite a perfect holiday dessert.  Other new menu items include Linguine and Shrimp ($23) and Blackened Pacific Redfish ($21 for dinner).  Paul Martin's will have a holiday menu through January 3, as well, including Chilled Alaskan King Crab Legs ($25), Grilled Lamb Sirloin and Herb Crusted Filet Mignon ($39).",

Tomato soup had a thick line of oil on top, steak salad was served medium rare when asked to be served medium well- lettuce was limp. French dip was cooked well done on one side and rare on the opposite side. Vegetable pasta was beyond filled with garlic. Menu never stated that vegetable pasta had mushrooms in it, would have liked to know that. Waiter was good pushed a little to hard to order salads and alcohol. Will not return could have gone to Houstons and spent the same amount of money for even better food.",

    "text": "I recently placed two orders to go. Both times the person on the phone was unfamiliar with the menu, and I had to wait on hold for her to go back and forth to ask basic questions. Both times I picked up the orders, they were incorrect. The first one was missing food--half the order. The second one had the French Dip prepared without following my request for additions. The au jus was way too salty, almost inedible. The mac and cheese was also too salty, probably because the ratio of prosciutto to pasta wasn't well balanced, which is a shame since this is one of the few places that uses good cheddar. Better fries could be had at most fast food restaurants. And the banana cream pie is certainly not worth the calories or money. Do yourself a favor and patronize any number of decent Scottsdale restaurants over this one, which is overpriced and overrated. Might I suggest Roka Akor just up the street?",

Our waitperson, Julia, approached us within 2-3 minutes, she was friendly, well dressed and very professional. She offered appetizers, suggesting some of her favorites, we asked several questions and were surprised that Julia not only knew the ingredients in each dish but also where the product came from AND it's all made from scratch! Love it!!    We ordered Salt & Pepper Wild Prawns * Town Dock Calamari * Kale Caesar Salad * Castroville Artichoke * Spinach Dip and ... we CONSUMED IT ALL  ( : Kale Caesar Salad was my personal favorite, exceptional product, white anchovies and the dressing was absolutely perfect. Least favorite was the Grilled Artichoke, mostly because it was just grilled artichoke. Overall, fabulous experience!!  Noticeably good quality product and nothing tasted sugar enhanced... Nice job PMAG - My new favorite place",

    "text": "Came here for lunch on a weekday, the first week they opened. I can understand that there are always kinks to iron out at a new opening but my experience was just blah. Not good, not bad.. I was with an elderly companion.  After being greeted at the front door the first question from the host/manager was do you have a reservation?  Not, how are you or how is your day going. (No, we don't have a reservation, its 11 am on a wednesday and you've been open 3 days..) We were then asked if we prefer inside or outside. I told them that my friend doesn't like drafty patios much so inside would be best. We were then brought to a table right next to the open screen of that drafty patio. While I thought it looked like a lovely enclosed patio with citrus trees and cute lights, that table was obviously not going to work.  After getting settled into a setback booth the awkward service,  or over - servicing rather, started. I think it was his first serving job so I can cut him a little slack, he was very kind and definitely friendly, just so so awkward. I don't understand it when servers announce their actions. (I will go get your iced teas and be right back with them, I will put your spinach dip in and be back to answer any questions, I'm going to take your plate if you're finished, I see you didn't use your silverware for your appetizers so I dont need to give you new ones..) its idle chatter, sounds unprofessional,  and is so unnecessary.  I know you're coming back with stuff I order...that's why I am here. Service should be unobtrusive at a place like what they're going for, you shouldn't interrupt your diners conversation to complete a list of service points you have to hit. They have a lot of fine tuning to do.  Another awkward thing was the staff that werent waiting on tables all standing around against the walls and watching service. I'm not sure if they were managers, corporate guys, or servers as they were all dressed nice. But the staring was uncomfortable..at least smile while you're watching. And you just opened, I'm sure there's something to do somewhere.  Oh yeah...the food! Nothing to write home about. Nothing stood out on the menu as different than any of the other upscale american grills in the area. They do use all local purveyors and boast a scratch kitchen, which is always a nice touch. I guess I was expecting some new and exciting can't get everywhere menu items to go with that.",

That being said, we were looking forward to visiting the Scottsdale location while here on vacation. We dined here three times in 4 days, the first two being for happy hour and the last one for dinner. We had a great experience for the happy hours, and thought we had a great experience for dinner...until the food poisoning hit. Yes, Brian V., my partner in crime, had the seafood platter as his starter, and within 1 hour of finishing our meal (as we were shopping in the Scottsdale Fashion Square) the chills, sweat, and uncontrollable vomiting began.  I got him back to the hotel and promptly called the restaurant to alert them to the problem. Michael, the manager I spoke with was not very helpful, and clearly did not know how to handle the situation. He told me to check in with the other manager tomorrow morning...yeah, not helpful. As I write this at 11:20 pm poor Brian V. is very ill, vomiting and experiencing diarrhea. Thanks for ruining our vacation Scottsdale Paul Martin's.",

We had a reservation and we were seated right away with the friendly host. And our server was very nice and polite, with the usual upsale pitch on wine and specials.   My short rib was absolutely delicious and something I would order again. The mash potatoes were pretty good too. My friends hangar steak was also delicious.   We did have an issue with my buddy's steak in which it had to be remade. Seemed to be well done and dry when we asked for it medium. We usually end up eating stuff even if we don't like it too much, but since we're spending $50 or so on a steak, it had to be perfect. Even when it came out the second time, it still wasn't cooked properly and seemed sort of rushed. It really killed the dining experience. And even if the manager and the server brought out a third steak, it would have been too late.   I give 4 stars because the manager and server handled the situation pretty well. They tried their best and it seems to be a fault in the kitchen side.   Would I come back? Yes, great ambience and service. Food was good, aside from my friends steak.",

We ordered the ahi tuna and butcher's board for appetizers and then the skirt steak and a filet mignon w/ bacon wrapped, crab stuffed shrimp (which is on their holiday menu - please try it before it gets removed!!) which was AMAZING! We loved the ahi tuna with chips as the appetizer and the steak was, of course, delicious!",

I had a seasonal special (perfectly prepared) Petit Filet Mignon with bacon-wrapped shrimp. The sides we ordered, brussel sprouts and Mac and cheese, were even better than expected. The cocktail menu also featured unique twists on well-known classics (raspberry mule and whiskey sours were well received at our table). I would be interested in trying a glass from their extensive wine list next time. Highly recommend for a special night out.",

The manager stopped by to check to see how we were doing since there was a bit of a mix up with our reservation. Things were handled respectfully & promptly so not a big deal for us! We ate a lighter sort of meal since we'd over indulged the day before. We split a burger & a chicken asian salad & both were prepared to our liking. The salad was fresh & flavorful & the burger has a pinkness to the medium request & the bun was dressed with enough seasoning to hit the spot! I'd recommend giving it a try. It is a large room & noise level is a bit loud but didn't bother me like it did my husband.",

Paul was our delightful server-and he intuitively responded to our needs, whether we overtly stated them or not.  If I said I like lemons-we received a bowl of lemons for our drinks, when I had difficulty choosing between an Almond Cake or Chocolate Cake for dessert, and ultimately chose the Almond selection-Paul brought an additional bowl of chocolate sauce for the optional drizzle.  When we were leaving-he promptly delivered our two iced teas to go-to quench us in the climbing heat.  It was nice to be taken care of-without asking.  My hubby enjoyed the Bleu Cheese Burger, oozing cheesy goodness, served on a perfect bun and accompanied by crispy fries. I opted for the Grilled Shrimp Butter Lettuce Salad-a lighter fare to justify dessert later.  Both were delicious and satisfying to our individual tastebuds.  We will be back-and we will ask for Paul-easy to remember-maybe his last name is Martin!  Wink!",

Makayla answered the phone and was extremely accommodating. Although spring training was here and all the restaurants were full, she put us on the list. When we arrived, we said we wanted to do the happy hour and were seated in the bar area at the high top tables. I don't normally like community high tops, but their chairs are incredibly comfortable ( and I have arthritis of the spine). Our server, Courtney was fantastic. We had him as a server the last time as well and he is incredibly attentive and friendly. I tried to order a cocktail I had previously, but it was seasonal. Courtney suggested alternatives, but also asked the bartender if they could make my seasonal cocktail. The bartender (I don't know his name - sorry) was able to make the cocktail and it was delicious. The service was quick and fantastic. I have a very specialized order and everything came out correct and tasted delicious. 10/10 would recommend.",

We understand there's been a recent change of chefs. This is a good thing. The food was always good but this time it was outstanding. First the service could not have been better. Our waitress, Annie (sp) was probably the best waitress we've ever had. Friendly and attentive but also gave us very interesting info on the kitchen and the food. She was just great.  The food was outstanding. We started with their Salt and Pepper shrimp. Fried with a great pesto aioli. I odered a special that was fried chicken. What came we six pieces of white breast meat with skin fried to perfection. While boneless, they are not chicken nuggests. The way the beast was butchered, it really is like traditional fried chicken. The coating was very tasty and the chicken moist. It was served with a killer dipping sauce, like a honey chili sauce. Also the accompanying potatoe salad was greast. Wife had a grilled skirt steak which was excellent served with these grilled sweet potatoes that were beyond great. We finished with a strawberry short cake on a southern cheese bisquit that made this desert the best version I've ever had.  Great service, good prices, nice sized dishes that are first rate. Wonderful place.",

That experience was great, but then again there were ready and on guard for us.   We returned last Saturday without prior notice. After arriving early, we sat at the bar for cocktails while waiting for our table to be ready. Drinks were great, the bartender engaging, servers were fantastic and stopping by to say hello as we waited. Once our table was ready we headed off to dinner. Our server, Heather English was amazing! We ordered appetizers and additional drinks. While waiting for those fresh bread was brought to the table and The manager stop by to say hello to see if our experience was going well. Yes dinner was spectacular!  But, the service was attentive without her hovering or ever making us feel like we were just 'another' table.  Wonderful experience.   In closing, I highly recommend Paul Martin's as it seems as though the bugs have all been worked out...!  In fact, I'm heading there next Tuesday for lunch with colleagues.",

At the peak of the \"ride\" (the prime rib), it was enjoyable. The prime rib was cooked perfectly at medium-rare and seasoned well. Near the end, I was disarmed by poor service (incompetent and rude waiter) and gross ice cream (specifically the gingerbread and chocolate flavors. I couldn't eat it.) -- to the point where I just wanted to get out of there or risk vomiting from disappointment and annoyance.   4 stars for prime rib/salad and management downgraded to 2 stars for service and non-lactose free dessert.",

    "text": "With my family, I went to Paul Martin's during Sunday night eating the Sunday all-day prime rib special for $25. It is not the worst, nor the best either. I have a list of pros and cons to show why I put 4 (and not 5) stars.  Pros: Overall, the food is pretty good. The prime rib special comes with an appetizer of green salad, an entree of prime rib with mashed potatoes, along with a desert with a shortbread cookie with three scoops of ice cream. Each of the courses were delicious: the green salad has fresh vegetables, along with the dressing blending all the vegetables together perfectly. The prime rib is very tender (with quite a bit of fat for most of our dishes) and the mashed potatoes were neither too mushy nor powdery. I was extremely satisfied by the size of the steak(most of us needed to box the steak) The ice cream is very creamy, and the shortbread cookies were a bit overwhelming, since there was too much sugar. The environment of the restaurant is relaxing, and it makes you feel as if you are in a movie theater. Fortunately, it was bright enough for us to read our menus, but I could use a bit more light.  Cons: The service was somehow disappointing. It was not as good as the last time I went there, since the waiter needed to be reminded multiple times in order to be told that one of our guests is lactose intolerant; he told us the ice cream is gluten-free. The waiters are not as knowledgeable as the managers themselves, since we asked if we could use a gift card that we bought the same day and he wasn't sure. We had to wait for quite a while in order for him to figure that out.  The food is not as good as what I hoped it to be, and I am somehow discouraged. I was not the slightest bit impressed or blown away by what happened today, mostly due to the lousy service. I truly hope that the next time I come back, I will not be dissatisfied again.",

    "text": "We made reservations on opentable for this place for my 6 yr. Anniversary dinner for the main reason that their menu shows that they focus on healthy eating and the foods change with the seasons. When we arrived we were greeted and sat down right away. The ambience this location has is so warm and comfortable, within minutes we had water at our table and a welcoming waitress asking what she can get us to drink. I stuck with water but my wife and our friend got a beer and I ordered the salt and pepper shrimp as our appetizer. (Yes, we had a friend come along to our anniversary dinner since afterward we were heading to a concert.) The waitress was so friendly and was quick to answer all the questions we had after bringing our drinks back. As we were getting ready to order the shrimp arrived and they were so delicious, They were perfectly seasoned and fried. I ordered the Cajun ribeye and it did not disappoint!!! I absolutely loved it. It was cooked to perfection and so juicy. For dessert we got the Ice cream on top of this cake thing... HAHAHA, don't know what it was called but I pretty much ate the whole thing. I gave my wife a bit and luckily our friend didn't want to try it which I was ok with because it meant more for me. The restaurant has warm and comfortable vibe to it, you can be dressed up or casual and it feels right either way. The cost wasn't that bad either for the amazing food we had!! Usually for healthy option restaurants you have to accept youll have to pay for what you get, in my opinion we got a smoking deal!!! To top it off the staff is amazing, they were so kind and welcoming... We will definitely be making a trip back soon, maybe once the menu changes so we can try something new!",

    "text": "Overall impression: Over-rated and over-priced for the quality of food.   Atmosphere: Great remodel of the old J. Alexander's with a more upscale feel. Layout is open with a bar in the rear that includes a few tables and lots of bar seating. When we were there it was quiet and slow. Tables are set nicely. Atmosphere is upscale.   Service: Service was attentive and friendly. Policies don't seem as welcoming. We were served a tiny dish of olives (1\" round dish that had 4 or 5 pea sized olives in it...maybe 1 tablespoon of olives). We asked if we could have more but were told that they would have to charge us $5 for another dish. If this had been a large dish of olives, such as the free plate of bread and olives that they serve at Houston's across the street, I could understand the charge, but this was a tablespoon of olives! We asked for bread, got 3 half-slices slices of bread which was good but almost certainly not baked in house.   Menu: Prices are very high but comparable to what you would find in steak houses in the area; however, the food is more casual (burgers, mac & cheese, spinach dip, french dip) so prices seem on the high end of what they should be. Starters such as cheese plate are $12 per person, spinach dip $14, and shrimp appetizer, $17. Entrees range from $13 for a veggie burger ($14 for regular meat burger), and an additional $6 for fries with that burger, and they go up to $39 for a NY steak.  I had the house made polenta and vegetables in tomato creme. The veggies were greasy overcooked. I was not able to cut them with my knife. The polenta was burnt (not just charred but black). It all sat in a lot of tomato creme which seemed to clash with the flavors of the grilled veggies. When the server asked how our food was, I said it was okay but I wondered if the polenta was supposed to be served that charred. The manager saw the polenta, apologized, and removed it. My dining companion had the chicken with mashed potatoes and liked it ($21). For dessert we had banana creme pie. Also disappointing. The crust had a thin ribbon of ganache on the bottom, topped by about 1/2\" of vanilla cream with a few slices of banana, topped with almost an inch of unsweetened whipped creme.  I wanted to like this dessert but it was bland. We left half of it on the plate.   We probably won't return. I would instead head over to Houstons for casual dining or Eddie Vs for steaks and seafood. Even though the prices were similar to other restaurants in the area, the quality was not.",

Our server was Caryn, and she was on her toes at all times.  She definitely knows her menu and made many recommendations on the wine and the food.  She did point out the 3 course special which consists of a $30 per person menu + $5 glass of wine.  We both ordered the short ribs with the kale salad and ice cream and short bread cookies for dessert.  This was my first experience with kale salad and it will not be the last - it was delicious!  The meat on the ribs melted in your mouth as did the fluffy mashed potatoes.  The manager brought me the wine and he checked in with us later during the meal.  Caryn was delightful as our server and was both pleasant and interesting.  She conveys the mood of the restaurant - efficient, young, hip and in touch with the surroundings.

He was knowledgeable and attentive!  We started with the spinach dip which I liked but my husband loved! Then we let our server decide the entree for us and he recommended a great white wine as well as the kale pasta for me and a brick chicken for my husband and to my surprise they were not the most expensive items on the menu. Both the entrees were the best food we had in our entire stay! Then we went for the Apple crisp as our server recommend and it was amazing! It can definitely cure anyone's sweet tooth. I don't know who Paul Martin is but he is definitely doing a great job with his food and staff!

    "text": "Actually closer to 3.5 stars. The restaurant's menu is as generic as the name. If you don't like seafood or meat - you are certainly not going find much to eat here. The menu is not creative and the dishes are all standard. As far as the food goes...I had a burger and it was excellent - cooked to perfection, which is a plus. When I asked the waiter, he said the meat was organic, but I am suspicious because it wasn't mentioned that way on the menu. The salad that accompanied it was awesome too. My date had the polenta, which was supposed to be served with freshly grated Parmesan cheese,  but wasn't. She also mentioned there wasn't enough sauce served with her dish and had to ask for more. I had a beer, in which I was charged more then what the menu said it cost and she had a glass of wine. For dessert, we split the strawberry shortcake. Yes, it was delicious, but jeez for $10 could they be any more skimpy on the strawberries? There weren't even enough slices to taste one in every bite. It was more like powdered sugar, fresh biscuit and whipped cream with a strawberry garnish. Although they were thinly sliced, I can't imagine there were more than two and half small strawberries served in the dish. The service was very good. Perhaps, my only complaint is that our waiter did not give us enough time to try our meals before he asked how our food was. The manager did briefly stop by our table. I would not go back to this restaurant without another coupon and even then - it wasn't really a great deal. This place is way overpriced. I agree with a previous Yelper that Roaring Fork is much better. I'd also add so is Seasons 52.",

My boyfriend had a burger/fries/beer combo for $13! The food was hot, fresh and delicious. The portions were very generous too and the ambiance is so inviting and romantic. Will definitely be back!!",

My wife and her father ordered the salmon that also came with sweet potatoes.  There was so much sauce on the potatoes that it ran into the salmon. It ruined it.  It's sad to say that the bread, and beverages were the best part of the meal.  We won't be going back there.",

They have indoor and outdoor seating but due to the wind we sat inside.   It had a nice vibe and the hostess was very friendly and helpful-even returned to the table to answer a question we had.  My friend had the mushroom soup and loved it.  I had the skirt steak which was very good.  It was tender and tasty and came with some arugula and sliced sweet potatoes..  The service was great and it was a good meal.  I'd definitely go back when in the area.",

My friend ordered the mushroom burger (vegetarian & comprised of several varieties of mushrooms). She was kind enough to share & I must say it was the best vegetarian burger I've ever had. Another friend was celebrating a birthday & the restaurant was kind enough to bring a complimentary dessert. Wish I knew the name as it was extraordinary ~ chocolate bottom with peanut butter, ice cream & topped with a roasted marshmallow. I would return just for the dessert.   Our server, Trent, was excellent as was the manager who made sure we were enjoying our lunch. Great food, great service & a beautiful environment.",

Entrees were good but pricey for the portion size.  My husband had the Marinated Skirt Steak which he said was delicious.  I had read the Brick Chicken was amazing so I ordered it (and I never order chicken when dining out).  Honestly it was just 'ok' and when it arrived I wished I'd have ordered something different.  I could very easily make this at home and the skin on the chicken didn't taste very good.  Kind of disappointing.  But I'm glad we tried the place out.  I'm hoping to return to try their prime rib special for a little better deal.",

So, I pass Paul Martin's twice a day. Last night I was starving and so many places close at 9. Paul was open till 10. Side note - I went to Taphouse Kitchen which states online that they are open till 10, but upon walking in at 8:40, I was informed in an unfriendly way by the bartender that the kitchen was closed. I am a bartender / server on weekends so I get the sense of a shitty attitude right off the bat. Can I do two reviews at once? Anyway... I walk in to Paul Martin's, was greeted immediately, went to sit at the bar. I am a vegan and can usually find something to eat at restaurants. Robert was behind the bar this particular evening and he assured that my needs were met, and he was also very pleasant to talk to. I felt bad because he had a couple come in at 9:57 and order a bottle of wine. They close at 10. No idea how long he was there. Great service. Great food. Had the grilled artichoke and quinoa bowl. Thanks, Robert. Will be back.",

We arrive at 8:00PM without a reservation, not knowing if they were going to be able to seat us right away.. and they did no problem. Our waitress, Heather, was incredible right from the get-go. I have food allergies and she wasn't hesitant or put off by my inquisitions. She was willing to go above and beyond my requests and made me feel special like every other patron. When you have food allergies, most of the time, your options are limited to one or two \"safe\" things on the menu. Heather was able to offer me alternatives and meet my requests no problem.  FOR THOSE OF YOU WITH GLUTEN ALLERGIES/SENSITIVITIES - they have a SEPARATE fryer for their french fries, which means no cross contamination!! This is epic, considering most restaurants just pile them all in together. I was so excited to be able to get a bunless burger, with the toppings, and sweet potato fries that were super crispy and flavorful. It was one of the best experiences I've had eating out in ages and I can't say enough good things about their waitstaff, their food and their service. HIGHLY recommend!!!",

    "text": "MUCH Improved!!!  I had a pretty unpleasant experience dining at Paul Martin's some time ago. I believe it was not too long after they opened. The only thing that lured me back to try again was their 3 course Sunday Prime Rib Special.  It is a beautiful venue, and since it wasn't very busy, I decided to sit at the bar where service would be pretty much captive. From the moment that I sat down, the Bar Tender, Dustin, took excellent care of my dining experience. He was on top of everything. In addition, this time, my food was excellent.   The Prim Rib started with a salad course, then there was a main course of perfectly cooked prime rib and mashed potatoes, and finally three scoops of their house made ice cream, with a couple of out of this world sugar cookies.   The last time I was at Paul Martin's, the salad was so poorly executed and poorly dressed that, since no one came back to check on me after leaving it, I had to resort to making up for the missing dressing with salt. Not so this time! It was perfectly dressed and delicious! Also, because Dustin continuously checked back with me, if there had been anything amiss, I know it would have been tended to.   When I cautiously asked for my Prime Rib rare, he assured me that they would prepare it any way that I would like - and they did! The Prime Rib was delicious, even if I didn't quite get their take on creamy horseradish sauce. It was a little too adulterated with other ingredients, and I couldn't taste the horseradish. I'm not a purist, but when asked, Dustin brought me a little dish of plain horseradish. Perhaps it was house made in some off beat way. It didn't taste like horseradish either, and had absolutely no bite,. That was OK though, the Prime Rib was just fine on its own. The mashed potatoes with the Prime Rib were delicious!  Finally, full as I was, I gave in to the house made ice cream. It was the creamiest ice cream I have ever tasted. Along with it were served the most wonderful \"melt in your mouth\" sugar cookies, with coarse sugar around the edges. I wasn't even close to finishing the ice cream when I had to give up, but I wrapped my other cookie up in a cocktail napkin and took it home for later. No way was I going to leave that cookie behind.  So I had a delicious, well orchestrated meal, and Dustin completely made my experience far and away better than my previous visit. I will definitely be eating at the bar from now on.",

This might sound odd to you but we ordered a side of broccolini and I'm still dreaming about it.  It was so simple, yet sometimes the simplest of flavors seem to make my tastebuds scream the most.  So tip, get the broccolini all to yourself.  We also ordered a side of the macaroni and cheese, which was creamy, crunchy (from the prosciutto) and also a favorite.  My dish was the winner for the night.  The short ribs were tender and melt in your mouth good, that with the broccolini, what more do you need.  My husband enjoyed his skirt steak but was disappointed that the menu said potatoes as the side and he ended up with three huge tomatoes on his plate.",

First visit we ordered the Annabella Pinot Noir - Great Food wine - a little more bold than typical PN's. My friend ordered the linguine and shrimp and I the hanger Steak.  We split each dish and they were a great compliment. The pasta is great with the garlic and spinach (add a squeeze of lemon and you are golden) and the steak was cooked to perfection.  Who doesnt love steak and mashed potatoes though.  Second visit we ordered the Annabella again because its just so good!  This time I had the Seared Tuna and my dad had the Cedar Plank Steelhead. These are two of my all time favorite dishes! Tuna had the best sear and the crust flavoring pairs so well with the pickled onions and arugula salad with white beans.  I legit licked my plate... not one of my finer moments. My dads salmon was killer in the mushroom jus - they do an excellent job of pairing foods and flavors with one another.   Oh also came here for happy hour (3PM-7PM everyday!) and sat at the bar, great vibe cool bartenders.  Had some Rose with the prosciutto crostini, smoked salmon flat bread, and smoked chicken and wings.  Love it all!! Great spot for a meeting too!",

A dab of steak butter on top was like frosting!.   Artichoke appetizer was overpriced kinda tough and not worth it. Generous pours on wine but a little on the overpriced side. I can't see spending $17 for a glass of wine. Just doesn't make sense to me. Lower your prices guys. Companion had skirt steak and it was equally very good.

What is delivered to the table does not equate to the prices on the menu. And, some of the food is just....no good. The mushroom soup and French onion lacked flavor and depth of cooking. Like canned with cheese on top. Terrible. I ordered a medium rare beef patty as a protein to my salad and it came out fully done, bone dry and looked like it was formed and frozen in Des Moines maybe last year some time. Two orders of short ribs at $30 were  way off. One was half the size of the other. The waiter should have noticed that glaring error. Halibut was passable but getting very near dry and over cooked. The salads were messy. The kitchen at this restaurant needs to be completely overhauled or keep it the same and cut the prices by 50%. We would not return. Just too mediocre and overpriced. The quality of the wait staff is wasted serving in this restaurant.  Two days later: You cannot ask for a better owner that recognizes that there was a problem and that will try to fix the problem.  He responded here and he responded with a phone call. Because of his response we will try this restaurant again.",

Our waiter, Jowonis, suggested the fried chicken and braised short ribs and both were great! A nice touch was the \"First Class service \" of a plate of warm wet towels with lemon to clean our fingers!! It was a special occasion so we splurged on dessert, the Buttercake with ice cream and berries! Yum!  Two different managers checked in on us to see if we were enjoying our experience! So, if you're looking for a top notch restaurant with excellent food and wait staff, this is the place to come!!",

    "text": "Booked in to eat here with my family while we visited town. There was a long wait - at least 20 minutes - for our table to be ready despite the reservation.  A few of his headed to the bar, where we had friendly service, though there was some confusion as a manager asked for my order after we'd already spoken to another barman.   After being seated, we ordered another round of drinks and some appetizers. The appetizers the best part: the shrimp cocktail came with large prawns and the dipping sauce was spicy and delicious. The French onion soup was also good and cheesy.  The entrees were disappointing. My medium-rare filet came out medium and wasn't very flavorful at all. All the sides were over-egged: the spinach was so coated in garlic that it tasted like raw garlic (I love garlic but found it unpalatable). The Brussels sprouts were shaved rather than halved, which was an odd presentation, and so coated in bacon and bacon fat that the whole dish tasted like bacon - again, unpleasantly so.  Our server was pleasant but inefficient, he would visit the table and ask one or two people if they needed anything, then another two people would shout a request after him as he left the table, then it'd take him awhile to circle back. At one point, as the restaurant was thinning out, I waited 15 minutes for a glass of wine. He stopped by and said it was on its way when I was about to ask, so I can't tell if the order hadn't been placed when I asked or if the bar took a long time, but most of our drinks came much more quickly when the restaurant was busier.  The decor and atmosphere are nice, and they made a little extra effort with a dessert for my birthday. Not all bad, but the entrees and style of service really let this place down for me.",

As normal I Yelped on where we should go since it was our 1st time together in Scottsdale. I was craving Fish and he was craving fried chicken...and when I reviewed the menu I saw that they had both and they had great reviews...it was also only 4 mins from our hotel. I made reservations but we couldn't wait so we went in early. Thankfully the nice hostess was able to seat us early! We had an amazing waiter who took very good care of us! We started with the wood fired grilled artichoke (castorville) it was served with an amazing garlic aioli. They also brought us some fresh baked bread that was delicious and soft butter. My husband had the Summer special, ribs, fried chicken, corn, & a cheddar chive biscuit. The ribs were so tender and perfectly seasoned... I stole his biscuit...it was delicious. He said the corn was amazing and that the chicken was yummy and moist! I had the Halibut!!!! Wow!!!! It was delicious, served with a sauce that I could have drank in a cup it was so good, blistered cherry tomatoes that went perfectly with the Halibut and asparagus...I added a side of mac-n-cheese. The Mac was really good but it had huge chunks of bacon in it and I don't eat bacon...so the husband got all the bacon. I don't mind the flavor of bacon...just don't like the texture....I know I am the only American on the planet who doesn't eat bacon! ;) My husband's dinner came with peach cobbler and I shouldn't have, because I was STUFFED, but I ordered the butter cake....I don't have enough words to describe this cake....heaven in a cast iron skillet!!! Yep...thats it.... HEAVEN!!!! no other words can describe it. I would drive 4.5 hrs again just for that!!! Actually we would drive 4.5hrs for the entire meal again!!! It was a great meal, great service and so glad we found it!!!",

    "text": "(4.50 stars)  For the final dinner of our Arizona vacation we only had to venture across the street from our motel, the Scottsdale Hilton Resort.  I had enjoyed dinner at a Paul Martin's location in the Los Angeles area two years ago, and was anxious to dine here.  The physical layout of the Scottsdale property was sleek and modern, with heavy emphasis upon dimmed lighting, chrome and glass-- not at all unlike the LA location.  Michelle P. was our server on Tuesday, and she was personable, pleasant, knowledgeable and reasonably prompt-- a very good job.  We skipped the appetizers, soups and salads and went right for our entrees.  Our sons and I each ordered a different steak (skirt, hanger and New York strip), while my wife chose the grilled salmon.  Each was cooked to the requested temperature, tender, nicely seasoned and attractively plated.  A sauteed \"heirloom\" spinach accompanied my steak, as it had my salmon two years ago.  Then, as now, the particular variety was properly seasoned, but otherwise flavorless.  Unlike my prior encounter, the tough lower stems had been trimmed; tender and tasty, but not memorable.  The boys each enjoyed their steaks, and my wife, the salmon.  The four of us broke from our normal practice and ordered desserts; three for the table.  Chosen were the homemade ice cream sampler, banana cream pie and the chocolate layer cake.  Each selection was superb; neither overly sweet, nor lacking in comfort food value.  An excellent meal!",

A complimentary dish of local olives and almonds kicks off the meal, with a small, locally-sourced menu heavy on beef (with several chicken and fish options as well). No matter your choice, you will not be disappointed.  I ordered the skirt steak, the slices of marinated beef cooked to a perfect medium rare and accented by the bright flavor of fresh arugula and meaty heirloom tomatoes. A wine list contained some formidable selections, with a few craft beers added in. Just as a fine cabernet sauvignon can compliment a steak, so can a bottle of North Coast Old Rasputin imperial stout.  Dessert selections were just as well-prepared and ranged from an assortment of house-made ice creams, a banana cream pie, and a decadently rich devil's food cake.  While not flawless (the bread, much touted by the wait staff, arrived lukewarm and with just a dab of butter), it is as good a dining experience as you will find in Scottsdale.",

It's the mark of a good bar to me., but they have a wide variety of items. In addition, they have some decent happy hour options.   Food:  I had the organic green salad (with peanut sauce) and the hangar steak. To me, any restaurant that had hangar steak on the menu is on its way to a good review. I special ordered it blackened (like their ribeye), and it did not disappoint. It was cooked to taste (med rare), and the flavor was great.  For under $25, it was a great value.   Dessert included the ice cream trio - their mocha is legit - and the others hold their own.   Service was very good - I ate at the bar, and their service was on par with great restaurants.    If you're in Scottsdale, it's worth a visit.  Not 5 stars only because I don't typically give those out (not that I know anything). But I would definitely come back.",

Our party of 2 arrived a bit early.  We requested a booth.  They accommodated us with no problem.  We were seated shortly before our reservation time of 6:00 p.m., despite the special request.  Trent, our server, was charming, witty, and offered us excellent suggestions.  We had mushroom soup, chicken chimichurri, and salmon.  The food was delicious.  Especially the mushroom soup.  The staff worked like a professional dance company, each person playing off of and helping the others.  When one person noticed that a table needed something, they didn't wait for the 'right' person to do it.  They all lent a hand.  My friend and I observed this throughout our meal.  Our booth was right next to the kitchen.  We had a great time looking over the wall, witnessing first hand the ease and professionalism with which the kitchen executed each meal.  The servers lined up like soldiers, ready to get their plates to the tables.   The manager stopped by our table just before we left.  We offered our thanks and congratulations for such a great experience.    My friend and I will definitely recommend Paul Martin's to our friends.  We will be back!",

    "text": "If I was only rating based on the filet I ordered this would be a 4++; so tender, so perfectly cooked; so yummy.    Unfortunately my husband also ordered the cedar plank salmon which drew down the rating considerably; the presentation on the creamed spinach was a miss...the same very bitter creamed spinach that was served with my dish...it was inedible.  And the mashed potatoes were fine but just sort of uninspiring....the best you can do for a starch side dish is mashed potatoes with some butter?    I do like that they still serve bread with dinner.  The apple crumble was nice to finish with.  Re value....it's a mid range restaurant ambience wise, but price wise it's beyond the mid range experience.   It would be a good choice for happy hour however.",

We also split a side of the mac & cheese -- very good. We all had a great time here & would definitely come back!",

My red wine was served over chilled, and my steak brought out bloody rare when I asked for medium. The menus which used to be printed on nice cardstock are now flimsy paper inserted into a laminated sleeve - ours were a bit greasy and not clean. Felt more like a chain restaurant. I will say our server Joel was wonderful. But I don't think we'll be coming back",

The bar was fully stocked including 1942, oh yeah! Our folks had both fancy drinks from the menu (super sweet, sugar sweet) and mixed drinks. Our pours were generous. :-) We tried every appetizer; potato tots (deep fried mashed coated with crumbs OMG, ordered it again!), short rib tacos (WOW), ribs (are you kidding me), ahi lettuce wraps (very nice) and smoked wings ( hello).   What a great experience!  This foodie will be back! Mostly for the tots of tater yumminess!",

The servers are very attentive and professional.  Food: For the appetizer; We split deviled eggs and the crab cake. The texture of deviled eggs were divine and it was screaming with flavor. Very delicious. I didn't get to try the crab cake but it looked really good and my coworkers liked it.  I had the ahi tuna salad and unfortunately it was very underwhelming. While the ahi was beautifully and perfectly cooked, I am not sure what this particular dish is trying to be. It seemed to be a fusion of Japanese American because it had some soba, then it had romaine lettuce, beets, oranges and bell peppers. The flavor combination does not work at all! Or either change the noodles to something else. I just ate it all because it was pretty pricy and I didn't want to waste food.  I had some espresso for dessert and some peach cobbler. Those were really good! You guys know how to make espresso we'll!",

Also lucky to have Sally as our bartender. So enjoyed watching her talents and making incredible cocktails. Started with Deviled eggs and a sparking lemon cocktail.  Friend had lemon drop. Then on her recommendation we had the pork ribs with Hoisin sauce . Both delicious!  She knew it was my friends Birthday offered dessert. Told her we were headed to dinner in the dining room. She went ahead and offered to reserve a table for us. Lovely.  Now we are escorted to our table by the fabulous Andrew. Co owner. What a nice gentleman. Enjoyed some banter and were introduced to our server.. Courtney.  He was amazing. Funny.... knowledgeable and great memory to not write down anything!!  We started with wines and the artichoke. Delightful. Then friend had a steak and mashed potatoes. I had the Halibut and on Courtney's suggestion... the spinach as opposed to asparagus. So glad I did. I could have had a bowl of that spinach!  Then dessert... the Butter Cake. Omg it was amazing! And we had 2 espresso martini's!  I can not say it enough... why haven't I been here?  I'm going back again this week.  Happy Hour alone is amazing!  Thank you to all of you that took care of us. Birthday Girl loved it.. so did I!!",

We ordered the following:  Butternut Squash Soup - warm and flavorful, a little too chunky for my liking, but they were so kind to split it for us   Seasonal salad - not your typical house salad! It had arugula, avocado, croutons, herbed cauliflower rice and tomatoes with a basil vinaigrette. So good!  Asian Chicken Salad - lacked in excitement a bit, but beautifully presented and great for a healthier option!  Pork chop - my favorite dish! It was topped with a delicious sticky, syrupy sauce and tasted so decadent. It was served with extra crispy Brussels sprouts, my fiance's favorite   And for dessert, the toasted almond cake. OMG, it was light, fluffy, and had a delicate almond taste without being overpowering. Great way to end our meal.   The service was fabulous. Our drinks were never empty long and we were often checked up on. I'll definitely be back, especially for their 3-7 happy hour.",

The welcome staff was not helpful, we wanted to enjoy happy hour, and asked about it as the led us outside, apparently you can only have it if you sit in the area without tables. Weird. So we went inside to ask if they could show us where the inside happy hour was offered, and we could tell they were not eager to help us. After asking a few times, and our hostest leaving us to answer the phone, one of the male managers, slooooowly and painnnnfully walked us over to the bar area. It seemed so odd because we were one of like 5 small groups in the entire restaurant. It was clear they had other priorities??   Then... a while later.... comes our server. We ordered some drinks, which after 10 minutes we ended up retrieving from the bar ourselves, because our server was no where to be found, just kidding we could see him standing back near the kitchen, and we could not flag him down. Okay.. then we ask him about  a few things on the menu, and he starts listing off all of the seafood on the menu... not what we asked to hear and very long explanation when we were clearly not interested. We ended up with some food from the happy hour menu, a flatbread and some tuna lettuce wraps. Everything was okay, but the lack of service was just terrible. We really wanted to like this place, but I can't see myself wanting to return. I hope other people have had better experiences here.  Note: the female manager seemed concerned when we voiced our opinions when she came around to our table, and she must have talked to our server because for the last few minutes of our dining experience, he was prompt and attentive.. what?! A little late, but thanks for trying.",

They are creamy mashed potato's deep fried with panko crumbs are are excellent.  The smoked chicken and wings were way over on the smoke flavor. They tasted as though they were marinated in liquid smoke. We saw no smoke ring yet they were over the top smoky and bitter.  The mushroom soup was ok but under seasoned.  The coffee ice cream was low quality ice milk and had big water crystals. Ir wasn't creamy at all.  The male bartender had a super crappy attitude. The lady was better but not fun..",

    "text": "Had a wonderful experience at PMAG last night with friends. Terrific atmosphere, comfortable seating and pleasant staff.   Our waiter  was knowledgeable, patient and kind. He accommodated our drink requests to make changes, apologized appropriately when they were out of a mixture and was responsive in a timely manner when fulfilling requests (more water,bread,another napkin etc..).  Cocktails were made correctly and tasted great!   The bathrooms were clean and smelled good. However, they did not have soap. The decorative soap bottle was empty. So I filled it with some water to get some soap out of it.   Now to the best part! The food was absolutely amazing!!!! The calamari was cooked just right! ( no marinara tho it came with an aioli) We had the trio special and not one complaint about the meat (fried chicken, Bbq ribs, and shrimp skewered). The elote corn on cob was scrumptious!  Oh and their bread is sooo good. Only one thing was not tasty, and that was the biscuit that came with the dish. It was greasy and flat. Didn't eat it, I went back to the bread!   Overall this place is a great place for American fare and to spend an evening with friends and family!",

    "text": "Popped in for dinner while I was in town and was impressed. I was seated at a booth, and my waiter, Courtney, was very nice. The table bread was fresh, delicious and came with whipped butter (the great part about dining alone is not having to share the bread). For my main entree I ordered the braised short ribs with a side of crispy brussel sprouts. The short ribs were advertised as coming with a horseradish cream, but there was only a small drizzle across the middle, which is really my only complaint. The ribs themselves were cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes that came with them were absolutely fantastic. The best part though, were the brussel sprouts. 10/10 would sprout again. They are a must order. Crispy and flavorful and the absolute best way to eat a vegetable.  For my dessert I ordered the toasted almond cake, which was quite good. It was moist and perfectly portioned, which I appreciated since I was already pretty full at that point.  The atmosphere is definitely reminiscent of your typical steakhouse, lots of wood everywhere you look and dramatic overhead lighting. I was seated near the bar area, however, the bar area was pretty quiet as far as noise level goes so I don't think I would have had a problem hearing my dining companion should I have had one.",

We haven't had a bad meal or dish yet.   If UR into Happy Hour, theirs lasts until seven, this is a must try. They have some incredibly tasty items for $6 (see photos), like Street Tacos, panko breaded Tater Tots and Deviled Eggs. For $9 (photos), you'll be in heaven over their Maple Glazed Chicken Skewers or St Louis Duroc Pork Ribs.   Their HH Cocktails are $6 to $9 and their wines by the glass ($6, $9 and $14) have some real depth. Gotta love their 7 oz. Williamette Valley Pinot for $14. Try it, you'll see I'm right. It's a great pour, nice bouquet, and has a sophisticate mix of berry tastes.   Their dinners are equally great, whether UR here on Sunday for their Three Course $34 Prime Rib Special, or a week night, or even a Sunday Brunch - you won't be disappointed.   I could write more about their food, but I'll let my nearly forty photos speak for themselves. Expect to pay around $40 to $50 for a great value, tasty meal that you won't soon forget and cannot wait to come back to Paul Martin's for more.  One last thing, if you can, ask to be seated in James' section.  All the servers here are really great, but he is exceptional. He remembers your likes and finds a way to make your visit memorable.   Enjoy!",

Then we had asked for a side of sweet potato fries all along with our steak, which came like 10 min after the kids meal. The waitress accidently spilled red wine on us. In the end weren't given any compensation or discount. Next time well have to think twice about visiting here again.",

    "text": "One word sums up Paul Martin's American Grill: EXCEPTIONAL. If there was every an indicator about the quality of what was to follow, the perfect fried calamari appetizer would be it...and it was perfect in every way, which surely isn't common in my experience. The fried shrimp, grilled artichokes, and antipasto appetizers all echoed the calamari: great quality and perfectly prepared.  As for the main courses, the blackened ribeye was magnificent: perfectly charred on the outside, tender and medium rare on the inside, and impeccably seasoned (I despise the salty bitterness that I've experienced with this dish in so many other restaurants).  Next up was a Chicken under a Brick. All I'm gonna say is this: make sure at least one person in your party orders this dish! I guarantee after all of the ooh's and ahh's you hear coming from that person's direction, you'll be ordering it on your next visit too. It was outstanding.   As for the space itself...contemporary and inviting. The small, semi-private dining area in the rear is where you wanna be if you have a large party.   I read some of the other Yelp reviews, and I recognize that even the best restaurants can screw up a dish on occasion - this one included - particularly when they're pushing things out of the kitchen on a busy night (the place was packed)! But that didn't happen to me. My overall dining experience was exemplary. My only criticism was there wasn't any room in my stomach for dessert. Great job!",

They have a great artichoke appetizer to start - almost as good as Hillstone's legendary artichoke. The drinks are always poured as if they are doubles, so be careful if you're going to drive after having a cocktail. If you are taking Uber, or have a designated driver, than this is the place to have dinner and drinks.  Tonight I had the roasted chicken with mashed potatoes. Roasted garlic cloves are used as a garnish on the chicken, and it is served in a generous broth. The potatoes are very finely whipped and contain lots of butter - just the way I like them! I highly recommend that you eat here the next time you are in the Scottsdale and Lincoln area.",

The fiancee ordered the shredded beef tacos and no complaints for the $5.00 price.  It didn't wow me, but for $5.00 to enjoy some tender beef with a good sauce, you can't complain at all.  Lastly they we're talking my language.  A burger, fries and beer combo.  Burger is fresh ground in house and you can tell.  Ordered medium rare, and came out perfect temperature.  Toasted ciabatta bun and black pepper aioli.  Fries were  good but the hand crafted beer selection is even better :)   So to top it all off, the famous and home made banana cream pie.  Won't say much except you have to order it.....okay I will say it was damn good!!!  Actually all their desserts are made in house, so I have a feeling no matter what you order you won't be disappointed   Service, quality and value 100%. Absolutely will be back",

    "text": "I went to Paul Martin's on Sunday evening to try out their Sunday prime rib special based on the recommendation of some family members who enjoyed the prime rib on a prior visit. The Sunday special is only $25 and includes an organic green salad, prime rib with mashed potatoes, and homemade ice cream for dessert.  Green salad - surprisingly, I really enjoyed the salad. I thought the vinaigrette was delicious (it was a sweet/sour dressing) and enjoyed the mixture of greens.   Prime rib - Very large portion. I ordered my prime rib medium rare and thought it was cooked well. Although the edges of the prime rib were more medium/well-done than medium rare, there was a lot of meat and I was pretty full by the end of the entree. In fact, I had them box some to go. I would have preferred a little more seasoning, especially since it started to get a little bland by the time I finished half the prime rib. However, I think it's well worth the price and definitely filling.  Ice cream - There were three scoops of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, and their seasonal ginger bread. The ice cream was good (I enjoyed the vanilla the most), but again, there wasn't anything particularly \"wow\" factor about the dessert.  Service: This is where I had the biggest issue with my dinner at Paul Martin's. On multiple occasions we had to remind our waiter that one of our party had a food allergy and could not eat the dessert. Our waiter then misheard the type of food allergy we specified and we had to restate the allergy. Furthermore, we bought a gift card on that same day and were told by the waiter that he wasn't sure if we could use the gift card despite the fact that we had been told by the manager that we could. (I honestly have no idea why a restaurant would have problems with us using their gift card.) We then had to wait for the waiter to go check with the manager (who we had already talked to) and come back to inform us that, yes, of course we could use the gift card.   However, during the meal itself, the waiter did a good job checking in with us and asking about the food.  I'm giving this 3 stars because although I did not think the food was particularly mind-blowing, I thought it was a great deal for the price and very filling. As a side note, I have not had the opportunity to try other foods besides the prime rib special. I docked a star for the service.",

They have great servers.  We shared the Grill Salad and it was great. They have wonderful crispy crust sour dough bread. We loved the smoked salmon appetizer with a nice sauce on the side  We had the Blackened Ribeye and the Brick Chicken with a side of their special Cauliflower. They were both wonderful. For dessert we split the Apple Crisp with vanilla Ice cream.  So glad we tried Paul Martins again! Thanks everyone for a great experience.",

The steak was simply damn good and will make one ponder about replacing their own backyard charcoal grill for a mesquite burner.   I was impressed by the staff, specifically the manner in which they worked together. From busboys clearing dishes to drinks being brought out, more restaurants could follow the training model of Paul Martin's American Grill.  It was in the higher end of price ranges, but for the area the cost seems comparable. It's not somewhere that I would go regularly for drinks because of the price. But rather a place to enjoy on occasion",

Such a wonderful value for exquisitely prepared food - $49 Wine Dinner for Two including two entrees, organic green salads, plus one bottle of wine (from a selection of 25).   Our server, Heather,  offered her expert opinion on food items and the wine list -- each suggestion exceeded our expectations.  Plus, her friendly and very attuned and attentive service was very much appreciated.  And, Clyde, the Customer Service Manager, took time out of his busy evening duties to make sure we were enjoying our dinner and that everything was at the highest level of food quality and service.   Ryan, another wait staff member at the restaurant -- his attention to detail and smiling face -- again, very much appreciated.  A wonderful team!

Our wait-person was friendly and extremely knowledgeable regarding the menu. They bring a small serving of almonds and olives to enjoy with your cocktails. We decided to split the Calamari appetizer. It arrive fresh and perfectly prepared. We ordered the  Chimichurri steak, and the house hamburger plate. Both came perfectly prepared, med-rare, as ordered. Both came with their house fries which were nice and fresh, but, a little too salty. The burger, with cheese was nice and juicy, made with flavorful beef. The bun, very important, was nice. The Chimichurri steak was excellent. Tender and flavorful, and, cooked perfectly. There was no room for desert, but, we did order de-caf coffee, which arrived barely warm. Most disappointing since this is the last thing served. I would definitely return, the entrees were excellent, the service friendly and professional, and, the decor beautiful. P.S.- they offer a daily special, until 7p.m. of a burger, fries and a beer, all for $13.00, a great deal.",

There was a little miscommunication with regards to the lady who calls those who have reservations as she told us they could make anything Gluten Free but when we arrived, both the waiter Trent who was great and the manager in the red shirt (who btw did not even know their was gluten in reg. pasta) said they were not able to make things GF.  So a little bummed I could only get a salad or soup and a app.  We started off with the artichoke app which is enough for two people which was real yummy much better than other places.  My friend had the pacific redfish and he said the spinach was amazing.  They did not offer anyone on our table bread or butter and I noticed everyone else had bread on their tables.  My other friend had the salmon salad.   I opted for the Butternut Squash Soup without the pesto on top as I can not have EVOO which their pesto was made with.  It was very thick and tasted like it had chili flakes in it.  Not a fan of the Butternut squash soup just average.  The best place to get the butternut squash soup is actually right across the street from Paul Martin's.  Overall my friends thought is was a bit expensive $15.00 for a glass of wine and $4.00 for a teabag /cup of hot tea.  The service was right on and Trent was amazing.  Three at the table - I only had an app and the soup, my friend had a salad and side of brussel soups which was sauteed in heavy EVOO with onions, then other entree was the redfish and a trio of ice cream bill before tip was $106.00.  Little expensive and I came in hungry and left hungry not much on the menu if you are vegan GF.  They should have more GF vegan options.  I would come back just for the artichoke which was very yummy!!!",

    "text": "Bad service. I just went to HAPPY HOUR at Paul Martins with a friend. I am allergic to quite a few things so before we ordered, I gave the waitress a card that listed my allergies and she said she would take it back to the kitchen. I said ok as I pointed to the happy hour menu and mentioned that any thing on there would be good. They already have a few gluten free options, so I figured they could make some substitutions on one of the hh appetizers like they had in the past. When she came back she said they could do salmon and cauliflower to which I asked if that was an entree and then replied that I had a late lunch that was salmon and that I wasn't really that hungry and would prefer an appetizer. So she suggested seared ahi tuna. I asked if it was an entree and she said that that was a salad. So I said yes that sounds good- I figure a small appetizer salad with some ahi tuna. No. A $28 salad.  I clearly came in for happy hour and told her I wasn't that hungry and left with a bill over $40. I suppose I should have asked how much it was, but I never have had a problem like this in the past. Also, when I mentioned it to her, she argued with me about it. The salad was good, but not really a \"salad\" and she should not have only suggested very expensive meals. I have had happy hour appetizers that are free from all of my allergies before. The meal tasted great though, props to the chefs!",

    "text": "A celebratory birthday dinner turned into an odd experience where we had to manage our meal throughout the evening.  While appetizers went well, and I highly recommend the fresh flavorful oysters, we were well through the course before the drinks we ordered upon seating finally arrived.  Our dinner orders were pretty straightforward: two rib eyes and two strips all medium, one salmon and one redfish.  Two servers arrived asking \"Ribeyes?\" and we directed them.  This was the first negative tipoff - a restaurant of this kind should know who has ordered which dish and deliver them correctly.  In the longer than usual few minutes before the remaining dishes arrived, we all looked at the ribeyes with curiosity as they most definitely were not ribeyes.  Then came the servers with the strips (again asking who should get them) and we took the opportunity to swap the strip steaks (cleverly disguised as ribeyes) with the ribeyes (cleverly disguised as strip steaks).  Finally, a server arrived asking \"Salmon?\" and deposited Redfish in front of me and the final dish of Salmon was deposited in front of the birthday girl, who had ordered Redfish.  It equated to a very frenetic and chaotic orchestration which made everyone uncomfortable.  After completing our main dish swap party we found the following:  Ribeyes - very thin (1/2\" at best) and well done Strips - thick and cooked perfectly, mashed potatoes dry and crusty Salmon - cooked as requested but with a mustard glaze that sat too long and became dry and crusty Redfish - served cold  Our waiter handled the issues well, refiring ribeyes (now reordered as strips, as the thinness of the ribeye would make medium doneness difficult) and redfish appropriately and refilling drinks on the house, however, we celebrated this birthday eating dinner in 3 shifts as meals reappeared at varying times (can't coordinate the refires to arrive together?).  After the last entree was finished the manager stopped by to let us know he was buying the ribeye dinners.  Generous and appreciated but then dessert was served (all good, banana cream pie delicious) and cappuccinos arrived after dessert was finished.  We are of mixed opinions on whether to give Paul Martin's another chance.  What they did well was fantastic but many, many missteps made it difficult to enjoy the occasion.",

    "text": "Full disclosure: We don't go out to eat that often anymore due to the fact that I have been really disappointed at the over priced, poorly prepared food combined with service that is really just above fast food.  But the wife's birthday was in a few days and I scoured review sites to find something upscale but not hoity-toity.  Paul Martin's American Grill was known to me because a client of mine, RLF Painting had done all of the paint and stain work in the restaurant. I looked at the menu on line and it certainly checked all my boxes. So as the deadline approached I pulled the trigger and made reservations online through open table.  We arrived and were seated immediately and soon was greeted by our server Amy.  One of the first things Amy did was tell us about the Paul Martin \"story\".  Turns out it is a scratch restaurant with no freezer or microwave, well we learned later that they do have a small freezer but it's for their home made ice cream. It's a seasonal restaurant meaning that all of the courses are made from what is in season and available.  Everything is organic, free range and grass fed.  WOW! That was totally new to me.  NOTE TO PAUL MARTIN'S MANAGEMENT: You buried the headline here. There was no mention of organic, free range, grass fed in the menu, I had to look under the \"About\" tab. You need to really highlight this on every page.  With Amy's guidance we ordered a couple Meyer lemon infused vodka martinis and salt and pepper prawns to start.  The martini was awesome, the prawns were killer and we learned that the cocktail sauce was also home made and had chopped jalapenos as a kicker. A little heat but not overbearing.  The wife ordered the blackened rib eye and I went with the braised short ribs.  BTW they do all their own butchering in house too.  Main courses were sizeable and I have never been to a restaurant where I did not have to add salt and pepper to my meal. Not here, it was seasoned perfectly.  Our meals were accompanied with a couple glasses of a 2010 Napa Merlot.  Desert was a lemon brulee and a special custom made ice cream dish for the birthday girl.  The food was excellent, atmosphere pleasant but what really heightened the whole experience was our server Amy.  When we were discussing dessert she shared with us that this was her first week there.  It shocked both of us and thinking about it later we realized how much time and effort management had put into her training. She knew the story about the restaurant, really knew the menu, how the food was prepared and was a competent guide through the wine list.  How many restaurants have you been in where you have a question about a menu item and the server says \"I don't know, but I will check for you.\"  Thank you Amy for your wonderful smile and extensive knowledge.  We will be going back to Paul Martin's and will request one of Amy's tables.",

    "text": "We live in Denver and come to visit Scottsdale once or twice a year. Dinner at Paul Martin's is always required, and we've never been disappointed. Contrary to what another review said, we've always found the service staff friendly and welcoming. Our latest dinner there was after a harrowing round of golf, and settling down in a booth felt like coming home. One of the features you have to notice is the quality of the butcher-block table tops. They practically glow, they're so clean. We started by sharing a grilled artichoke with aioli (sp?) sauce. I don't know how they make this dish so good, but it's better here than any others we've tried--and we've tried it often! My husband had the rib plate, with 8 big, meaty ribs and sides of coleslaw and french fries. He practically licked the plate! I had the Chesapeake Bay salmon, but put in a special request for spinach as a side, rather than couscous. I got the dish just as ordered, and it was delicious. The salmon was perfectly cooked, with a light onion sauce that was great. For dessert we shared 3 scoops of ice cream with shortbread cookies. The only shortcoming of the meal was the caramel ice cream, which was low on caramel taste or feel. The chocolate and vanilla flavors were great, and the shortbread cookies wonderful. Throughout our meal, our waitress and the rest of the waitstaff were cheerful and attentive. Yes, it was a pricey meal, but less than we had expected, and worth every cent of it! It remains our Phoenix favorite!",

Wanted to go for happy hour, made a reservation since it was Friday & wanted to guarantee a table.   Once we were seated in the empty dining room & I inquired about happy hour, I was informed it restricted to the bar area only. The bar area was packed & happy hour is restricted only to two picnic style tables & four high-tops on the right side of the restaurant. I really couldn't believe there were real estate restrictions! My boyfriend & I decided to sit next to each other instead of trying to awkwardly yelp across the large table (seriously, you feel like you're at kings of the knight table).   Our waiter from the dining side was amazing & super nice, but unfortunately we had to switch once we moved over to the bar. The service in the bar wasn't as great & it literally look about ten minutes to get drinks, but the margarita was really good!  As far as the food goes, I ordered the calamari because it caught my eye when they handed me the dinner menu. So that one was full price, but it was worth it because it was definitely ten times better than the salon street tacos I ordered. The sauce they use on them was so salty it was making me gag. To make it even worse, the lemon that comes with it was coated in salt. My boyfriend ordered the burger + beer + fries deal for $15 (which is pretty sweet since it's any craft beer). He said the burger was delicious.   I don't plan on going back to this place, solely based on the restricted happy hour. Their dinner menu otherwise is overpriced.",

    "text": "Some things happen by chance but even chance happenings are meant to be. Since another restaurant was still getting over brunch in the late afternoon and other area spots are steakhouses, Paul Martin's was the obvious choice for lunch.  So go ahead Paul, make my day. In fact...I think you've made my life. I can't dine out the same anymore, at least not for the next couple of weeks. Let me keep the memory of our rendezvous fresh in mind. Our time together was well spent.   It's nice to see an upscale restaurant serve customers quality food and filling quantities at comparable prices. Everything was easy to eat and I didn't get tired of any one dish. Needless to say I stuffed myself and almost considered sneaking a couple bites off the carnivores.   This is what they ordered:  SALT & PEPPER SHRIMP starter (19.00) - eight large shrimp, lightly fried and served with green onion shavings and pesto aioli. This looked so yummy. The fry was golden brown and not greasy at all.    BBQ PORK RIBS kitchen classic dish (26.00) - fall off the bone rack of meat with sauce and sides of french fries and slaw. The ribs looked large and plentiful. I didn't see any fat or chewiness on them.  STEAK & BACON TACOS kitchen classic (17.00) - two tacos of mesquite grilled angus in corn tortillas with avocado cucumber salad. I was told the meat was filled with quality and flavor.  COLUMBIA RIVER STEELHEAD sandwich (14.00) - a filet of grilled salmon topped with arugula and pesto aioli between a soft roll with a side of thinly cut fries. No morsel was wasted.  PM has a concise menu. Only one dish was labeled vegan: a warm quinoa bowl with mushrooms, avocado, and veggies, but few options can be ordered vegan without the aioli or cheese. Vegetarians have pickins from each section except the kitchen classics.  I ordered:  SEASONAL SOUP starter (8.00) - small bowl of creamy butternut squash with a drizzle of olive oil and a couple of croutons. Best bowl of butternut I've had. Mild sweetness which I enhanced with a dash of ground pepper.   THREE MUSHROOM burger (14.00) - mushroom and cheese patty topped with arugula on a brioche-type roll dressed with pesto aioli and served with a side of sweet potato fries.    FIELD GREENS side salad (6.00) - generous portion of fresh crispy greens and slivers of cabbage, tomato, red onion, and sunflower seeds in vinaigrette.  PAN ROASTED CAULIFLOWER side (6.00) - roasted cauliflower florets and whole garlic cloves in oil and lemon juice. The addition of the citrus gave a delicious tang and cut through the oil nicely. The menu lists parmesan cheese as another ingredient to the dish, but thankfully I didn't taste any cheese. It was good without it.  It's unusual for me to finish everything on my plate(s), but it helped that saltiness and seasoning were perfect. The fries didn't even leave a greasy residue on my fingers or face. That's good cooking!   5 stars for Paul Martin. Good service. Good food.",

There was a good amount of waiters and waitresses!! It being New Years night there were less than I expected!  We ordered our drinks pretty quickly!! Once the waiter brought us our drinks he did not come back for a god 7-9 minutes!! We kind of wanted to hurry our dinner up because it was late and a long day!!   When he came to take our order the food came out pretty quickly!!   AMAZING RIBS AND MASHED POTATOES!!!    After all this a great family place to eat!!   We had to wait along time for the check and when we had it ready to pay it took awhile for him to get it!   9.5/10  - 0.25 for the long wait between drinks and ordering  - 0.25 for slow check return",

I ordered medium well, which is supposed to be mostly cooked with a slight amount of pink. It arrived medium rare for both of ua, and they were both sent back. Mine came back charred and over done, so it got sent back again. My date finished her entire meal and drink before we asked where mine was. Several minutes later, it comes back butterflied, and well done, and smaller in size(like they had cut my old piece down, flipped it into two connected pieces and replated it without the char). Disgusting! I was embarrassed for the waiter and flabbergasted that they would treat a customer that way. Restaurants come and go in Scottsdale, and the ones that take pride in their work are the ones I frequent.",

The lighting is dark but pleasant, the music energetic but quiet, and the ambiance rather pleasant.   The food is also good. I had the Sunday special offering, which is salad, prime rib, and ice cream for $25. The salad was good and had a decent flavor palette without being overwhelming.  The prime rib was tender and had an amazing spice rub that took it to the next level, but the interior was something of a vast wasteland of okay meat. The desert didn't happen for me - they had no options for lactose intolerant patrons, which was rather disappointing (and perplexing, given the upper echelons this place places itself in).   The service was rather poor. The server was clearly overwhelmed at times - at one point, he responded to our lactose intolerance inquiry by telling us that the ice cream was gluten free. It actually became rather offensive when we were made to feel guilty about using one of their gift cards - I have no idea why a steakhouse would make paying customers feel so awkward about using a gift card they sold!  Long story short, the food here is four stars, the service two. Three seems appropriate.",

I love that this is in my neighborhood so it's almost like me cooking at home. Reservations are suggested but I've always been able to slip in and enjoy the friendly staff and yummy food. If you can snag a seat on the patio, even better especially during this beautiful weather. It's cozy and perfect ambiance to canoodle.  As recommended and tipped by fellow foodies, I highly recommend the Raspberry Martini. I probably would have imbibed on the great selections of drinks but only more reason to return since happy hour lasts til 7p. I loved the calamari as a teaser to start. And the kale Ceasar is pretty filling especially when you add salmon or chicken. I have to say I swooned over the niman Pork Chop which is major kudos given I always choose steak. I think it takes finesse to cook pork to be juicy and tender; hence, I didn't share though the portion was so big I had leftovers. The brussel sprouts were perfect accompaniment to the entree. Who refuses mac'n'cheese should never sit at my table! The highlight for me is truly the staff. They have such an ease and joyful smiles that you want to stay til close. I thought it was kind they didn't rush us out despite past closing time. I have no problem ending my day here and so should you.",

I also like their private \"room\" in the back for larger parties.  I put room in quotations bc the table is separated from the rest of the dining area by thick curtains.  Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed with the entree I ordered: chimichurri steak with fries.  The steak was flavorless, or if it did have any flavor, it was overpowered by the STRONG charred flavor from the outside of the steak.  Basically, all I was tasting was something charred, with the texture of a steak on the inside.  And I ordered my steak medium rare so there was no reason for it to be so charred.  After a few bites I asked my friend if she liked the steak (she ordered the same thing as me) and she said it tasted fine, so maybe it was just me.  But she also likes her steaks well done with no pink inside at all.  Anyway, I didn't even finish half of it and just took the leftovers home to my dogs.  My dogs gave the food 5 stars!  But they also eat grass and sometimes their own poop, so that's not saying much.  On top of the overwhelming char flavor, the oil from the food (I'm assuming from the chimichurri sauce) was all over the plate.  It was too much oil!  and it was getting underneath the fries and making them soggy with oil.  Mergh, for $21 I expected more.  I did appreciate that they had regular parking, as well as a valet.  I hate places where you are forced to valet your car.",

    "text": "Probably the best Cobb salad I've ever had. I ordered it with chicken instead of the steak. It was huge, which it should be for $18. That's the only reason I'm taking off a star. I feel like a salad should be at most $15. The dressing was so good! It was blue cheese with a lot of dill. Sounds kind of weird but it was amazing. I'm a salad lover and if you are too, you know how hard it can be to have the perfect dressing! This salad doesn't disappoint. We also ordered the banana cream pie and again it was one of the best I've ever had. You could tell it was hand made. It wasn't super sweet like you would expect, which made it that much better. Highly recommend it! $10 a slice and a good size for two people.   This restaurant has really great food! I just wish they weren't overpriced. The decor is nice and it's a great place for a date night or w friends but I still feel like they could take off $3-$5 from every meal and it would be more reasonable. I don't think there was much of anything under $20 on the menu. Most was priced much higher than that.",

I didn't know it was possible to have a meal so lacking any taste.  I did not finish it.  My husband ordered the ribeye, which was slightly better, but the mashed potatoes were cold upon arrival to our table.  Don't waste  your time or money.",

This is the new american cuisine to ease my curiosity of Paul Martin's style and techniques, and to ease my craving palate for different flavors. Oh the joys of summer has shineth upon us.   Our table was ready as expected with a reservation. Beginning beverage was the Raspberry Martini. House made infused raspberry vodka, lemon juice and sweet vermouth. Does indeed pass the sweet drink test! :)   Let's get straight to the food: Cedar Plank Salmon  - From the Classics. comes with shallots and bacon to give the powerful dominating flavors to best complement the cedar notes of the salmon, along with organic bloomsdale spinach, and crimini mushroom jus. This was a nice delicate dish to finish every last bite of.   Marinated Skirt Steak - thinly sliced with a pink center cut for the medium, with hearty mound of spinach on top.    Lemon Meyer Creme brulee - a seasonal dessert. Bits of lemon rinds in the creme brulee and 4 mini slices of lemon on top, and a couple biscuits. This is one of my many favorite desserts. I could just come back for this alone!   A phenomenal place for dinner, drinks and dessert.",

My girlfriend and I were in Scottsdale for vacation and decided on Paul Martin's for dinner - so glad we did.  We sat at the bar for a few cocktails and some of the salt and pepper shrimp. They had live music and the musical guest was excellent.    Our Bar tender was very courteous and engaged in some friendly conversation with us while we enjoyed our drinks.  The manager stopped over after we got our appetizer and checked in with us to make sure we were enjoying everything.  I thought that was great.  Once we sat at our table our server was absolutely awesome and very knowledgeable of the items on the menu. My girlfriend ordered the steelhead and I must say after I had a bite I wanted to eat the whole thing. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned just perfectly.  I had the steak tenderloin (med rare) and it was done exactly how I wanted. We had such a great exreperience. Paul Martin's does everything right. Thank you for being such a classy, well-run, high quality restaurant. If I ran a restaurant I would want it to be run just like this place.   Cheers!",

Dinner: I had the ribeye she had the chicken. Steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned deliciously. She loved the chicken. Both were served with mashed potatoes which were damn good.   Too full for sweets. Although they do have some home made ice cream which was tempting.   Everything here is cooked fresh daily. None of the sauces are pre made. You really can taste the difference. The price was also very fair. I've paid more for similar meals. With everything above including a glass of 12 yr scotch and a glass of wine our total was $120 + tip.

I like mine cooked well and often that means dry and overcooked. It's tough not to over do. But Paul Martin got it just right. It was cooked all the way through and still moist. I thought the portion was large - especially for lunch. The bread didn't win any points. It was kind of a slab of bread and easily skipped (helps the diet plan!). We ended with their Banana Cream PIe and coffee. The Banana Cream pie had a thin layer of chocolate. It didn't overwhelm the bananas. Banana Cream pie can be a heavy dessert. This was light and didn't overwhelm the senses. The coffee was great. Everyone who worked there, were pleasant, polite and had great smiles. They certainly gave the feeling that we were welcomed.   The only things that slightly f took away from the experience. We were at a booth right next to the kitchen. There's a whole row of booths that are parallel to the kitchen. There was a lot of noise before the restaurant was half full. We sat at the outside edge of the booth to hear over the noise. Odd for a place like this.  And the service was great once they discovered us. I sat for over 10 minutes without being acknowledged by a waiter or asking if I wanted a drink while I waited for my friend. My friend arrived and it was almost another 10 minutes before we were noticed. The waiter made up for it - service was amazing after that. Just odd because the restaurant wasn't that busy and many waiters went by but no one seemed to take notice. Very minor point and certainly the waiter gave fantastic service after that.",

I explained to the waitress that I was vegan and would like the pasta. I asked them to make the pesto for me without the cheese which is very easy to do. She said they could not because they make it in big batches. This really means they do not make it at all. It is ordered pre-made. I asked what other sauce is available. She said they could add a butter sauce. I asked if they use a vegan butter. She said no. I asked about the Brussel sprouts. She explained everything on them including bacon as though that was a vegan product. I told I do not eat bacon. She said it could be made without bacon. I had to eat sweet potato fries for dinner because I did not want a salad and the Brussel sprouts were horrendous.",

Our waitress Amy who extremely accommodating said she would ask her manager for permission. The manager came over and told our group no there is no ordering of happy hour allowed in the dining room and he would not even allow the member of our group to walk to the bar and get a happy hour drink and bring it back to our table where the entire rest of the group was ordering food. I have been in restaurant management for 8 years and know how to handle customers and this situation was handled horribly. I'm from California and have worked in high end restaurants for years. The manager came over and basically whispered so other guests wouldn't hear. The name of the manager at the establishment was Clyde. The only reason I am giving this establishment a 3 star review is our amazing waitress Amy who did an outstanding job of handling the situation and keeping us in the restaurant after the extremely abhorrent handling by the manager.",

I also ordered the banana cream pie like someone recommended here, but I was not a fan, the cream tasted like it had been stored uncovered in the fridge with onions and garlic, not very pleasant.  The service was very good.  I will probably wont go again for food, maybe for a drink during happy hour since the place is really nice and has a trendy atmosphere.",

    "text": "Paul Martin's used to be J Alexanders and I liked the old restaurant. Food was very good at typical higher end Scottsdale prices. $14 cheeseburgers. $28 entrees. $8 Carrot cake was awesome. I was disappointed to see it go out of business.  Now we have a California restaurant in it's place. I knew that the second I sat down at the bar. The place mat gave me the entire lowdown on the chickens. You know, the fact that they are not kept in cages. Is this important to you? Me neither. I just want a good meal with friendly service, nice atmosphere and a decent price. In this case, 3 out of four ain't bad.   It's California cuisine because it's food with a social conscience that beats you over the head. Free range chickens, ethical farming, fair trade espressos... you get the idea. if you love that sort of stuff (and in reality, I know it's probably your girlfriend who does) than bon appetit. Have a not very large and average tasting $15.50 cheeseburger (cheese is extra) and sleep better because the chickens aren't in cages.  The place does have a nice atmosphere, but so does Houston's across the street and so did J Alexanders.  Very friendly wait staff. Food delivery was quick. Beer selection is limited. Maybe the wine list was better. Don't know. Not a wine guy.  I left wishing I had been able to find a seat at \"Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers\" in old town Scottsdale. Good food at a decent price. Do they have ethically farmed local ingredients? They don't say and in all honesty I couldn't care less.",

Alexanders - the patio is spacious and airy and today at least [it's still spring...] had blooming orange trees so the atmosphere was really pleasant. We sat at one of the sofa/table combos and it was comfy and not at all awkward to eat. Decent crowd, nice hum and could have our own conversation unimpeded by surroundings. Boom. We were firing on all cylinders. Until the food.   Service was prompt and attentive but not hovering. BP [biz partner] had the Asian Chopped and our server Dustin suggested the Greek Salad with Lemon Prawns [I was wavering between that and the Grilled Salmon Sandwich.] We both had iced tea - crisp, unsweetened, fine. Our salads came out and I was jealous. The Asian looked more appetizing than mine - better presentation and overall just looked more appetizing. Mine had whole butter lettuce [I mean, okay, but really? It's a salad. Why do I need to cut my lettuce, peeps?] Two different kinds of olives - which, if I really was an olive fan would have been great because there was very little else of substance. There was a nice amount of feta, way way waaaay too many tomatoes and I'm sorry, THREE prawns. Three. They tasted good but for $16, I would've had more protein if I'd ordered the sandwich. It just isn't a good value nor that great.  [$40 before tip for two salads and iced tea.]   It's just a 'meh' from me - even the outstanding patio space doesn't save it.",

And she subbed the French fries for a sweet potato.  It was actually a potato with sugar and the server argued it was an  organic sweet potato.  What a joke.  I would never come back",

    "text": "We went to Paul Martins last night for dinner and were very pleased with our experience.  This is a brand new restaurant created by the owner of PF Changs. Our waiter, JASON, was terrific and super knowledgable providing us descriptive details of the food and suggestions such as a Pinot Noir imported from California.  This restaurant has a woodsy/steakhouse decor mixed with a zen ambiance of candles and stones. It is a casual atmosphere where you can dress up for a three course meal or come in and watch March Madness at the bar.  I highly suggest the salt and pepper prawns appetizer.  Again, most of my credit goes to our waiter who was extremely knowledgable, attentive, and accommodating.  I will be returning back for sure!",
