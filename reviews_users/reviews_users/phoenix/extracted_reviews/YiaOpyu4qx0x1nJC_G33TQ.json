(my friends had their wedding rehearsal dinner here).   The appetizers are truly disappointing... the salad was way too sour... I would give this place 2 stars since the pizzas are decent and the service is great.   I tried the meat lover pizza and chicken pizza, both were delicious but not spectacular.    Overall, this is ok.... a little overpriced and I probably won't come back.",

I also love the roasted red peppers in their house salad.  I'm pretty sure I've reviewed other locations and rated them 4 stars but this place ranks 3 stars compared to the others. Service is not as great. One time we stood in the lobby waiting to get acknowledge by someone for almost 10 minutes and had to walk into the dining area and flag someone down to get us seated.",

Great, lively atmosphere. Good food, good wine, good service. We'll be back. Note to manager:  Pointing the way to the ladies room is just fine. If I was 8, I may need to be walked there.",

Really lively on a Friday night and best part is the staff took really good care of us.   I ordered the small House salad and a large pizza with Jalapenos. The best part of Grimaldis pizzas are that they are thin and the sauce has an unique taste - love it!  He cheese is not overwhelming either so perfect for a group of 3-4 people.  I have to say if you guys don't have a spicy pallet, fear the jalapenos - they are spicy!!!   The salad was good too - had the dressing on the side but the portion was just perfect for the three of us - giving us enough space to demolish the pizza ;)  Overall great experience - love the ambience, decor, service and food quality! This is one place I won't hesitate to go again!",

FOOD: Pizza was awesome as usual, ordered large pepperoni with red sauce and a small white pizza with meatballs. The crust is thin and has that delicious brick oven taste. the perfect slice to fold in half and eat New York style.   SERVICE: Our server was nice but wasn't helpful in order recommendations or menu education. Wished my in laws could have gotten the first experience that we did at another Grimaldi's Location.

Large House Salad was nice, and easily satisfied 5 people. Wine list was decent and the prices were reasonable. Our server, David, was friendly and took good care of us.  CONS: why 1-star? The food, wine and server were good--no denying that. The problem? A group ostensibly had the patio area reserved. The roadblock?? Our party of 5. We were seated at 5:30 pm. By 7:30 pm, the large group AND several of the restaurant staff made it clear (verbally and non-verbally) we were in the way. To wit: one of the group's females (bleached blonde, oh so close to 50 and chubby) in the group pointing to our table and telling a nodding server, \"This needs to go.\" LoL! Was she a Real Housewife of Tempe??? The non-verbal? Restaurant staff placing a dozen extra chairs for the group just a few feet from our table. The final and best part? An employee (not our waiter) asking us if we needed anything else, and saying, \"Okay. You know it's a special thing to be able to eat on our patio.\" Really . . .? 4 of 5 of our party unanimously agreed his tone and body language was communicating, \"time for you to move on\".  I rant, but a fun and good meal was ruined. I complained to a manager. She was apologetic and even gave us a gift card, but the damage was done. We tipped David 20% for the service and food, but left w/ a very bad taste in our mouths. Caveat emptor. Our family will not be coming back.  RS",

    "text": "The Grimaldi's franchise is NOT the same as the cozy original under the Brooklyn Bridge. Lets get that clear. They are getting 2 stars because they are supposed to live up to the Patsy Grimaldi's reputation. They use half the sauce as the original, which is aggravating because pizza at the very least is SAUCE, cheese, and dough. Since they use the real mozzarella, the cheese does not melt and cover the dough, which is fine because that's how the original is. BUT to have large portions on the pizza with NOTHING on it, its bush league. They charge something like $2 for extra sauce, and extra it is not. I wish they would not charge for extra sauce. If you ask for a side of sauce, they will bring you Calzone sauce, with chunks of meat that does not resemble the sauce that goes onto the pizza. You have to specifically ask for PIZZA SAUCE and at a cost of .001 cents to them, I have to wonder why they are so cheap about it.   Other than this, the pizza is like the original. The service is excellent. The staff is very well trained, although it does seem to have high turnover.",

    "text": "7131 W. Ray Road Chandler, AZ 85226  We arrived at Grimaldi's at 6:00 and were seated immediately. It was the birthday of one of our party and he had a coupon for $20 off for his birthday.   Drinks were served in a timely manner. For soft drinks they serve Pepsi products. The also serve iced tea as well as passion fruit iced tea. Our birthday boy had a Green Apple Sangria ($8). I personally did not care for it, but he seemed to enjoy it.  Two of our party ordered salads. The small Caesar salad ($8) was nicely done, but the Caprese ($9) left items to be desired. The tomato would not be ripe for another week or two, and the balsamic vinegar was a cheap knockoff.  On to the pizza's. The birthday boy ordered an 18\" buffalo chicken pizza ($25). Testing a piece of the chicken, I found it to be dry and very vinegary. The buffalo sauce was there, but not in any quantity nor very spicy. The garden salad (veggie pizza) in 18\" was adequate ($24). For myself I ordered the 12\" white garlic pizza with mushrooms ($15). I found the cheese to be quite hard and the pizza seemed devoid of sauce.  Unfortunately, as a former New Yorker who has eaten at the original Grimaldi's this establishment just does not measure up to the original standards.   While the place was clean and service was fair, the pizza's just aren't that good. Never before in my life have I spent $88 for pizza for 4 adults and a child. Add in a tip and you are easily over $100.  2 stars",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  I can only speak to my experiences here, and for the most part, they have been great.  It appears many of the low-star reviews have to do with service and the price of the food.  Like I said, I've never had bad or particularly slow service here.  The ONE time, we had a party of 20 on a busy night when the rest of the restaurant was full too.  Was it slow getting the food?  Yes, but we totally expected that.  As to price, all I can say is, for the quality of the pizza, it's not bad.  I might, MIGHT, give this place 5-stars if they lowered their prices but as it stands it's still a very good pizza.  It's not a New York slice, so despite the name, don't expect that.  It's not the same as the original Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, so don't expect that either.  But you get a solid thin crust pizza that holds up to being held in the hand (as opposed to flopping over immediately and losing all your toppings.)  The ingredients are very good quality and the flavors are balanced well for a pizza, veering towards a little salty, which is fine.  It's a pizza.  I particularly like their sauce.  They don't over do it on the cheese (which has nice drag) and the crust has a nice chew.  Little blisters on the crust and the smoky bottom point to a well seasoned oven and a pretty darn good crust.  Possibly a little stingy on the toppings, but I get it.  They have a business to run.  And the pizza still tastes great, so there.  4-star pizza joint, not a 5 though.  My New York wife also heartily approves.  And she's had it all.",

I try to keep the number of toppings to a minimum to prevent the crust from taking on moisture and ruining the experience.  I haven't been to this location in quite some time, but I remember it being above average with respect to food and service quality. During this visit, that memory was confirmed. The crust on both pizzas were almost cracker-like in its crispness, and the toppings tasted very fresh. The manager came by to check on us and make sure everything was to our liking.  My wife said the diet Pepsi tasted like bug spray, but that's pretty much how I think it tastes anyway, so... they must have gotten it right ;)",

The pizza taste just like the one I've had in Brooklyn. Nice thin crust with a flavorful red sauce. My nephew had pepperoni and sausage and believe me they were not holding back on the meat! I had the meatball personal size pizza and lots leftovers. Twelve inches is very large for a personal size pizza. We took home our leftovers. We also had the red house wine in the half carafe. What a deal for $9!  The wine was delicious. No bitter after taste or sour note. It was smooth. The service here was impeccable. Jess was amazing! She was friendly, personable and took care of us. Even her manager Ashley came to our table and spoke with us. We will definitely come back here with a larger group for sure. If you're looking for good authentic thin crust NY style pizza, this is the place!!",

We sat at our table for 20 minutes and were completely ignored the entire time.  They were not busy, servers were talking and laughing with the hostesses and cook staff.  I even made eye contact with several servers and were not even asked for our drink order.  Puzzled as to why this was happening, my wife and I looked around the restaurant to see if we are missing something.  It took one glance to realize what was really going on, we were the only Hispanics in the restaurant.  Furious about this, we decided to leave.  As we were leaving, there were some servers talking and laughing with the cook staff and a server talking and joking with the three hostesses there.  My wife let them know how horrible the service is there, and right when that happened, one of the servers with a faux-hawk and beard came rushing up to us to ask if we've been helped.  I had made eye contact with him several times as he was hanging out talking and laughing with the cook staff and other servers, so it is beyond me as to why he waited until we were leaving to ask if we had been helped.  It is a shame that we still have establishments where racism and discrimination is acceptable.",

There were 2 of us and we seated in a tiny table against a brick wall...not the most likeable spot. We waited quite a while for a waiter to come to our table. Funny, cause there were about 6 waiters and helpers standing on the side chatting and not helping anyone. Finally, a waiter came over and took out order: 2 ice teas and a medium pepperoni pizza...pretty simple.  We received the drinks right away and after a bit of a wait, we received a plain cheese pizza. We told the person who delivered the pizza (it wasn't the waiter) that it was the wrong one. He said he would find our waiter and take care of it...10min later...the manager happened to stop by and we told her what happened. She apologized and said she could make a new one, but it would take another 15-20 minutes more. We decided to just eat the pizza we had instead of waiting. She didn't even \"comp\" the pizza for the screw up.  We never saw our waiter until we got the bill, we had to ask another waiter to refill our drinks and get our waiter...HORRIBLE SERVICE.  The pizza was ok, but definitely not worth the $$.  NYPD, Streets of NY, or Barro's pizza was better.  I wrote an email to the manager after I got home about the lousy service.  Didn't hear back from her for 4 days and I get this \"canned\" response letter that they said to bring in a small group of friends and they would make sure it was better service...blah blah blah. Should have fixed the problem where we were there.  Decided to try it again (had a coupon): 2nd time was for takeout...another simple order: 2 topping large pizza. Ordered it over the phone, got there right it was supposed to be ready and waited 10 minutes for a manager to approve the coupon cause the waiter had to get manager approval.  Got home and the pizza was a greasy mess underneath...was real nasty. The grease was leaking through the box. The dough was soggy and not good. Called to speak to the manager, and was put on hold. After a while on hold, I gave up and wrote the manager an email about the problem...3 days later no response. Send the email the company president...no response for either. I guess they really don't care. ....they'll be out of business soon if they keep this up.",

    "text": "Had a birthday celebration for the hubs here recently, and they handled our somewhat rowdy party of 16 like pros. Was able to call ahead and reserve space, pre order extra large tiramisu \"cake style\" and had Lainie, the lovely fellow NYer as our server.  The bussers were on point, clearing quickly, keeping water filled, and boxing up extra bread for my carb loving niece.   Everyone enjoyed the appetizers: antipasto platters; caprese plattters, and the Mediterranean and Caesar salads. I preferred the Medi salad. Lainie suggested the Girl and Dragon Pinot Grigio, a quaffer, which was crisp, reasonable at $25/bottle, and part of the proceeds of vineyard goes to charity; we were very charitable ordering four bottles with dinner ;)   The tables ordered The Don, Quattro Formaggio, and a couple of \"make your own\" custom pies. All were served piping hot, and everyone enjoyed their respective pies, and sharing. My favorite is the Quattro. Generous toppings and nice char on crust. The tiramisu is light and tasty.   We've had variations on the above during subsequent visits, and were satisfied with food and service. Scott took the cheesecake to-go on our last visit and absolutely loved it. Great for a date night or large party, we shall return.  * Sign up for their email club, and receive a free pizza (up to $20) for your birthday, or up to two weeks after *  ** they are currently offering a special on Gift Certificates for the holidays (order online) $50 cert gets you a $10 cert; $100 yields $20 cert **   *** Patio seating (overlooks the car park @ Las Palomas strip mall) ***",

What I always look for besides great food is great service.  Isn't that what you pay for?  Anthony took our order and our pizzas were in front of us in less than 20 minutes. Hot and perfect. I am spoiled when it comes to Pizza because I grew up outside of NYC and know what I like.

While I waited she asked if I wanted water.   The service didn't stop with her. All the staff behaved like this. Eye contact, smiles, and eagerness.

It was a DEAD FLY!  It hadn't just landed because it looked like it had been soaking either in the dressing or drowned when they washed the the lettuce.  I thought that I would be nice and tell them manager in a low voice which I didn't receive a thanks for she just said \"oh\" and took my plate.  What made me angry was that we didn't receive an apology.  I just walked out and haven't stepped in a Grimaldi's ever since. JUST KEEP A LOOK OUT!",

She said she could give me a coupon, told her not her fault and I should not have to ask as this is basic customer service.  Encouraged her to talk to the Manager later and that I was disappointed in the Manager not her.    Obviously the order fell through some internal crack, the Manager should help the team own it to the customer.  Much less irritating then wishful continuous missed estimates to correct.   But wait...it gets better....I get home and they got the order wrong.  My bad I should have checked but i would have been there forever.    I have diet restrictions and could not eat any of it with my family.   Wow.   Oh well.  Two pizzas and I am cooking my dinner very late but at least I have food,  others in this world will go to bed hungry tonight so  I'm obviously okay.",

    "text": "On \"Black Friday\" November 27, 2015 we decided to have a late lunch at  Grimaldi's Pizzeria on Ray Road. Since we have dined here many times, we expected a great meal without issues. We arrived around 1:30PM and seated right away. This was after the normal lunch hour, so the restaurant was not crowded--but did became crowded latter. A spinach salad was ordered along with a large pizza with sausage, pepperoni and basil. The salad arrived with no issues. We then ordered a second large pizza with basil added after the first pizza was baking. We do not like all hot items served at once as the pizza will cool off. Therefore we order the pies staggered. The first pizza arrived shortly after the salad. Have you ever wondered why a restaurant would serve an over cooked pizza with BLACK BURNT CRUST? I told the server that this $24 pizza was not acceptable. This was not the first time that an unacceptable burnt pizza was served. It was taken away, but still it should NOT have been served UNLESS they decided F it, serve it and see what happens. Of course we understand that the pizza at Grimaldi's is thin crust baked in a very hot oven but over baking is simply not acceptable. The crust was BLACK/BURNT 360 degrees around this pizza. Of course they said they were sorry but \"come on\"! The replacement pizza arrived without issues as did the second pizza. Our total bill was $70.26 including 3 soft drinks and one beer. Due to this experience, I had to reduce the rating since a BURNT pizza was served.",

The Crust is not too much to brag about, the ingredients were decent but the house salad...umm much to say about it. because it was just that, bland.  Service was pretty good, our waitress handled the busy evening really well and she spoke about Grimaldi's like she knew her stuff.  I really liked the clear glass by the kitchen so you can watch them preparing an order.  There are quiet a few pizza places better than Grimaldi's but the atmosphere, service, and pizza are just fine.  We enjoyed our food and time here.",

    "text": "Grimaldi's serves up thin crust pizza with fresh, flavorful ingredients.  A friend of ours reserved a room for a promotion party, and we came here in anticipation of tasty pizza.  The party started with some crisp salad with a bottle of vinaigrette and garlic bread. Then, came the parade of pizzas.  The whole entire table was filled with various types of pizza to satisfy even the pickiest eater.  The pizza had a very thin crust, layered with various fresh ingredients such as ricotta, mozzarella, sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms.  The pizza sauce was robust and more paste-like (To prevent the pizza from getting soggy I'd imagine).  My favorite of the plethora of pizzas I tried was a lovely ricotta mushroom pizza with fresh mozzarella.  The only slight negative was that it was very easy for the pizza to get cold since the pizzas were so thin, which thus turned the cheese a little rubbery as it got cold.   Service was excellent despite having a large number of people to serve.  Drinks were refilled fairly promptly, and pizzas were served promptly after everyone had arrived.  Since the pizza is thin, you can eat a ton of it before getting full.  I probably had twice the amount of pizza I normally would eat, both because of the tastiness of it and because of the actual pizza itself.    So, if you're in the area and craving pizza, Grimaldi's is an excellent choice!",

I love how each location installs a water softener/filter to get their water just the way it is at the NYC location for the best pizza dough.  My go to is their white pizza with Pesto.  I am also happy they have added the \"chef selections\" for pre-designed pizza ideas instead of having to make up your own.   The reason why I haven't give them 4 stars, and honestly its a little closer to 3.5 stars, is the price.  My pizza is relatively inexpensive but when the boy orders, I want to scream at him.  He adds all the toppings and the $9 personal pizza turns into a $20, 12\" pizza.  Even the chef selections are $$$ with most of them being $16-$18 for.  And we cant order a large and do half and half because toppings are the same price for a whole pizza or a half.    I understand with price comes quality but it makes it hard to come here often when the bill is always $40+ for 2 small pizzas.  I just need to leave the boy at home.",

The meatball pizza my family got was cooked just right. The meatball was soft and meat used was good quality. The cheese was fresh and had a nice aftertaste. However, the only complaint was I ordered extra cheese and there was very little.  The staff provided fresh dough for the kids to play with which created a distraction. The waitress was nice and polite. The hostess was a little standoffish however did her job well. Over all I give this fine establishment 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to everyone that loves pizza!!",

After 30 minutes, my daughter wanted a drink refill and went to the bar, waited 10 minutes, not a bartender to be found.  Finally I asked our server if our waiter had left or maybe forgotten about us. 2 minutes later our waiter walks up and said in a sharp tone \"I didn't forget about you, I was serving a group of 25\". That was it. I'm empathetic to someone being busy, but at least acknowledge you ignored us. I asked for the check, 2 minutes later he walked back and handed to me and didn't say a word. No thank you, no apology, nothing.   Disappointing experience at Grimaldi's Chandler today. Never had this experience in Gilbert, which is where we'll head next time we want Grimaldi's. We won't come back to Chandler.",

Some people were dining outside and everytime the door opened, a fly or two would make its way inside. This place needs to put some kind of roof over their patio, who is going to sit out there the next 5 months? The pizza was better in the Las Vegas area Grimaldi's. The crust was way thinner than usual and the pie had no real pizza taste or anything going on. It actually arrived at the table not very hot either. I did save $20 by using the coupon, so little to quibble with, but the pizza should be uniform now all over since this place is just another chain now and an overpriced one at that.",

To be truthful, I was expecting greatness.  All the reviews I read and all of the feedback from friends built this place up and I was hoping for an awesome pizza place that would be nearby.  End result, I simply can not understand the cult-like following of this restaurant.   I mean, it is hard to mess up pizza.  You have to seriously be a pretty bad if you can't turn out a decent pie.    Grimaldi's pizza was simply average.  Our pizza came out and looked great, but as soon as you picked up a piece, dark grease poured (quite literally) off.  As a result, flavor and texture wise the pizza was a near equivalent of the \"pizza\" from Sbarro's or any other mall pizza.  I have been to Cibo, Bianco, and the like.  Overall the best pizza I have found is from Picazzo's.",

(All the locations are excellent, this is just the closest to home.)  We order the same thing every time because it's pretty much perfect - White with Garlic pizza, extra cheese, mushrooms, and pepperoni.  The flavor is wonderful and the texture is a great combination of melty soft cheese and crispy, wood-fired crust.  Each component part is good enough to eat on it's own - spicy pepperoni, creamy cheese, fresh mushrooms, and a slightly salty crust.  HIGHLY recommended.  We've had a couple of their salads before - the Mediterranean and the Caesar.  Both had fresh with flavorful dressings.  The Caesar was my favorite of the two - tangy and bright tasting, with a nice Parmesan cheese on top.  BTW, even the small size salads are large enough to share between four people.  The only issue we've ever had was with the service when this location first opened.  All subsequent trips have been wonderful.  The staff is friendly and the decor is very nice.  It's a little on the spendy side, but totally worth it!",

Cooking pizza in a coal oven is tricky and every easy to mess up and hard to get a consistent product out of unless you really know what you are doing. The two \"cooks\" I watched doing the pies weren't paying attention, and our pie was underdone, while the table next to us got theirs overcooked, The waiter we had just couldn't focus, despite not being busy, or he is a bad listener, forgot our salads, but made up for it by comping them without being asked. Desserts were institutional and overpriced. Think I went here a long time ago when it was a Tomaso's but I could be mistaken.  People said Do Grimaldi's-OK, I've done it, now I am over it.

However, the draw here is the pizza.  I was already prepared for the premium price on supposedly premium pizza, but such was not the case.  The large white pizza was really lacking the flavor I am used to and the crust just didn't do it for me.  I tried a friends pesto and there wasn't much on there.  As others have stated, they do skimp on the toppings a bit for $2-4 per topping.  In conclusion, I gave it a try but they won't be getting my hard earned money again.",

    "text": "I went here the other night with a group of girlfriends since they do 1/2 price wine on Tuesday nights. A fantastic deal but alas, this past Tues. was the end of that promotion. Hopefully they bring it back in the future because without that, I am not sure I would visit again. I liked the decor and our service was great but nothing about the food really wowed me enough to make me want to come back.   We started with the caprese salad. The ingredients were very fresh but very basic. Beefsteak tomatoes and generic balsamic. Basically, it was ok but I could have made it just as good myself with ingredients from the grocery store. The pizza is billed as New York style but I don't agree since it was not soft enough to fold in half. It is more that crispy thin brick oven variety that has become so popular lately.... my husband refers to it as \"crunchy pizza\". And I know that the whole coal-fired thing is kind of their trademark but I did not enjoy the black carbon residue all over my fingers when I picked up a slice. Minus one star for that.   Overall the food was ok and our server was super nice. Very friendly but not overly intrusive. She did disappear after bringing us the bill but another server stepped in to take our cards. So they have good team work which is nice to see. I also liked the brick walls and wine bottle light fixtures; although it definitely feels like a chain they still aren't too boring about it. One thing I did not like was the seating. They only had a couple of booths along the walls and they were all full so we had to sit at a table in the center of the restaurant that was not nearly big enough to accommodate four people and a large pizza in the middle. The size of the tables and the rigid, armless chairs does not make you want to hang out and enjoy wine and conversation. Which is sad since they did have a solid list of lower to mid-range bottles at reasonable prices.  I think this would be a fine place to take a family out for dinner but not the best for a date night or girls night.",

    "text": "I walked in here the other night with a friend not knowing what expect.  My friend says to me, \"oh they have great pizza here.\"  Of course my friend has the taste buds of a dog, and dogs lick their own butts, so I took his comment with a pound of salt.  The hostess was super nice and eager to help.  Walked us to the bar, explained the menu, made a recommendation (pepperoni, tomatoes and garlic which we went with), and took our order.  I think if she could have helped us devour the pizza, she would have been right there with us.  Pizza came to about $24, and for a quality pizza I think $20ish...so slightly above what I was expecting.  Once I folded my slice in half (as you should) and put that first bite in my mouth, I knew instantly where every penny of that $24 went.  It went into that first bite and I still had the rest of that slice plus three more to look forward to.  I'm pretty blown away and really don't have much to nitpick here.  This is just a single experience, and a take-out one at that, so the five stars should be taken lightly.  There will definitely be a round two at this place.",

    "text": "My wife and I ate here last night and were enthusiastic upon entering the restaurant after hearing and reading all the hype about this chain.  But, what a major disappointment.    We ordered a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms.  Grimaldi's is very proud of their pies with a $16.00 sticker price on a basic large cheese.  Toppings are $2.00 each.  So with $20.00 invested in the pie we were hoping for a really good taste.    We like our pizza a little extra crispy and ordered it that way but it came out chewy like a piece of jerky.  Upon inspection - I pulled the cheese and topping layer off the crust - we saw a gummy crust that looked like a glazed donut. A total turn-off.    Also, the sauce was tasteless and the cook skimped on the toppings.  I've eaten a gazillion pizzas in my day and this pie gets a letter grade of an F.    For starters we tried the house salad and at best, it was very average.  The ingredients weren't chopped/prepared professionally and the dressing was bland.    We mentioned our disappointment to our waitress and she had the manager come over to speak to us.  We pointed out the gummy undone crust and he took 50% off the pizza and said he hoped we'd give his store another try.  But nothing turns me off more than unjustified hype, and Grimaldi's gets way too much credit for basically no reason.    I think I'll stick with Oregano's....or heck, even Peter Piper has way better pizza.",

I'm removing stars because their add-ons are ridiculous. They sell a personal margarita pizza for $12. If you want to add garlic, it's $2 extra. They also charge $2 for minor things like extra basil. That's just outrageous. Their sauce is sufficiently flavorless that add-ons like garlic and basil become necessary if you want a good pizza.",

Thought it was weird that it was right next to another ice cream place in the same shopping center. This is a very fancy shopping center. The whole place is decked out. Almost feel like you took a wrong turn and ended up in Scottsdale. But as I learned this is a pizza place. That is all they do. Except for a few salads and some deserts the only thing on the menu is pizza and calzones. Which is great. If you do something really well stick with it. Don't try and do a bunch of stuff and end up being sub par because of it. It is not that big of a place. Smaller than I thought. But it has a nice decor. Old school New York pictures everywhere and wine bottles turned into lights. We were seated and our server Jess was right over to help us out. She asked if we had ever been there before after we said no this was our first time she proceeded to explain how things work. Everything is build your own. You pick your size, whether you want regular or white pizza and then add whatever toppings you want. Toppings are extra. We ordered drinks and she brought them right out. Then we ordered a peperoni and Italian sausage calzone and a spinach and meatball pizza. After a good pizza baking time another server brought out the calzone and then Jess brought over the pizza. She informed us as she put it down that she had accidentally put Italian sausage on the pizza as well. She was going to let us have this pizza while they made another one for us but we said it was fine and she told us they would not charge us for the extra topping. Little mistake but she handled it very well. Both the pizza and calzone were very good. Wasn't expecting such a thin crust on the pizza. This is not fold in half pizza. Overall it is very good. Not to expensive unless you go nuts with toppings. Jess was very nice and pretty cute. I like the simple menu too. I would go here again.",

The boyfriend and I went to satisfy our pizza cravings on a Saturday night. When we arrived we noticed there were several tables open on the patio. So when we walked in we asked the hostess to seat us out side. We were rudely told there no tables available. The other hostess even asked about a certain table and hostess number one told her it was reserved. Okay then. I understand if there aren't tables open but the condescending tone was not needed. So we sat inside.  The waitress was nice, luckily, and we ordered a caesar salad and a sausage and ricotta pizza. The salad was good, nothing exceptional but good. The pizza however was delicious. A million times better than in Scottsdale. The crust was nice and crispy, the sausage had good flavor and it had lots of big dollops of ricotta. I kept eating even when I was full because it was so tasty.   I would not hesitate to go back. Hopefully the hostess will be in a better mood next time.",

Restaurant looked nice but music was way way to loud for a Sunday afternoon with so few people.  Staff were friendly and a good appearance.   We sat adjacent to the bar our servers as the bartender ( Cody B ) great service, he was attentive, polite and informative.   Our order two 12\" pizza's 1 Brooklyn bridge - good but needs flavor. Maybe something added into the ricotta    2 The Don - good flavors could a bit more meat.   Both pizza's were crisp will just make adjustments on our next visit.   By the end of the meal I understood why the music was so loud. The people had tripled in the restaurant and the music seemed better due to the noise between the kitchen and patrons.   Over all I would give the a good and try again but not something I'd go out of my way for.    As with all my reviews I'll give them another try before giving them a thumbs up or down.",

    "text": "Even though every time we come here it is great. It is time for another review.  If you are looking for Pizza in the Valley it can sometimes be a challenge. Good pizza is hard to find. Although I have noticed that there is a big change lately, with much better Pizza around. However, Grimaldi's has always been good. It is still really good. This time around we came on a Saturday night.  Of course they were busy,but we were seated right away. Although it was the table right by the Kitchen. I kind of did not want to sit there. But, I was so glad we did.   We had the pleasure of watching the Pizza being made. It was so cool to see the guys throw the dough up in the air, and spin it around till it got bigger and bigger. Just like in the movies. They were so fast ,they must of made 100 pizzas while we were there,or at least 50. Hehee But, the Pizza was divine. The crust was light and airy. the toppings were perfect. We created our own Pizza this time, (the toppings).  We had wine and ice tea, as well as 2 really great salads.  Check out the photos. I have to say the Manager is really great here. Which is probably a good reason that this restaurant is so successful! He goes around to every table checking on everyone. He even brings out food , refills drinks,takes away used dishes. These are all the signs of a great leader .And no, I don't know him. It is just an observation of someone doing a great job. We really enjoy our time here.If I had guests from out of town I would be happy to bring them here.",

Them, red sauce with sausage, tomatoes and onion. Both were delish and arrived hot. Service was great...almost coming by too often! They kept refilling the soda glass, which was nice. They have a crispy thin crust pizza but it is very pricey for pizza...basic pizza is $16-18 and toppings are $2 or $4 each so our pizzas were about $30 each! Very nice atmosphere.",

Chandler and Ahwatukee residents: Eat here with confidence... knowing your food will be just as good here as the Scottsdale location without too far a drive!  That said, the service was a little lacking on our most recent visit.  I think the waiter assumed we would not be tipping well because we were redeeming a free birthday pizza, so he gave us subpar service.  But why wouldn't we order a free pizza (along with our other items) if they sent it to us?  Who in their right mind turns down free food?  Of course we tipped on the pre-discounted amount, but not everyone does.  So, I understand a waiter's pre-conceived frustration.  Still, do I have to tell the waiter \"I am going to tip you X amount as long as you give us good service\" in order to receive good service?   3* for service.  4* for the pizza and the apps.  I am leaving it at a four because Grimaldi's shouldn't have to suffer because of a waiter's off night.  Still, Grimaldi's, you might want to have a little talk with your waiters about working on their poker faces; showing your disappointment all over your face when a customer presents a coupon you provided to them is not a good start to a meal.",

Their pizza sauce is absolutely tasteless.  The sausage was really good but they really skimp on the amount they put on the pizza.  When they brought the pizza out it looked fantastic but when I started to eat it lacked any flavor.  The crust also does not stand up well to their watery sauce.  The middle of the pizza was like a soup.    My wife ordered the ceasar salad with chicken on top.  The greens seemed fresh but the chicken is the typical Cysco bought painted on grill marked chicken you find at most fast food places.  I will never understand how an actual restaurant serves anything that is pre- cooked from a food distributor.    I work to hard for my money to give it to places like Grimaldis Pizzeria.  I won't be back.",

The decor of the place is very nice and the hostess greeted us in a very comforting manner.  Our waiter was also very attentive and helpful when we were ordering.    The thin crust pizza we ordered was pretty good, but not the best I've ever had.  However, I would definitely eat this pizza with great enjoyment.  Didn't order any alcohol, but the bar appeared to have a pretty good selection of drinks.

We also didn't appreciate when our waitress smugly informed us, right before we'd even placed our order, that pepperoni & Ranch dressing \"do not belong on pizza\" and to not bothering requesting it.

The sauce is a bit bland. It serves it's function for the pizza, but really doesn't add anything. It definitely needs something.  It's a nice place, but not something I would go out of my way for.",

But if I am craving pizza, then when I get it I want it to be great. Tonight my boyfriend and I decided to be a little unhealthy and eat at Grimaldis for the first time. He's usually not a fan of thin crust pizza (I love it, though) and we were both really impressed! Our waiter was good as well, Alex I believe. I usually can't eat more than a slice and I had 3... It's a little pricey but you get what you pay for definitely.",

The lights that they use are wine bottles handing from the ceiling and they look mighty nice. Now, lets get to the good stuff-the food. Their pizza is really good. The crust is amazing! We got a large pepperoni and mushroom pie. My kids really enjoyed the food and they're pretty picky eaters. Service was really good, I'm not sure what everyone else is talking about, but our waitress was very friendly and fast. I highly recommend this place!",

However, the pizza is bland. They were skimpy with the sauce and the cheese. Even the additional sauce was bland that my server brought to the table. I used salt, pepper, and everything at the table to give that pizza some life, but I could not breathe enough flavor into it. If you don't care for tasty food, then this is the place for you. I will go to New York for real New York pizza to see what they really offer because I'm sure this didn't do it justice.",

The salad included spinach, red onion, cheery tomatoes, bacon, crumbled gorgonzola cheese and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. I mean, come on! Wow is all I have to say about that. Just wow. One more time, WOW.   Moving on to the main event, we shared a 16 inch Don Pizza. For all you meat lover fans, this pizza is for you. It's topped with Italian sausage, meatballs and pepperoni. We each ate two slices and were in Pizza Heaven.   To complete our lunch, we ordered the Dessert Trio. Our of the Tiramisu, Cheesecake and Cannoli - the Tiramisu was the tastiest. Next time, I'd rather order the Tiramisu by itself.   The service was prompt and friendly, which is important when we are on lunch and have meetings to attend to.

Being from the east coast, we know a good cheese pizza.  A bad slice of New York is still better than anything I've had on the west coast.  (I can't make the comparison here to the real thing in Italy - that's just heaven)  The pizza arrived and looked amazing.  A good ratio of sauce to ideally placed cheese, and a little piece of basil smack dab in the middle.  My husband took a bite of his first slice and I waited a second for mine to cool.  He smirked at me and said I was going to be so pissed off.  I prepared myself for another disappointment.  I took a bite, paused and just smiled at him.  FINALLY!  The slightly sweet sauce of perfectly ripened tomatoes paired with the real mozzarella on a thin crust....wow.  Two days later and it's still making me smile.    But he was right.  I am pissed off.  Pissed that I talked him out of ordering the 18\" pizza.  And also that I will have to drive between 2-5 hours when I want pizza to make me happy again.",

    "text": "When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's AMOREEEE! I love the atmosphere in this place; from the red checkered tablecloths to the subway station signs on the walls, it feels like a genuine New York pizza joint. The original Grimaldi's is still up and running in Brooklyn, New York, and somehow Arizona was lucky enough to get a taste of this NY pizza chain. I will go ahead and say that Grimaldi's is one of the best pizzerias I've found in AZ.   I have searched for other pizza places closer to my area, hoping to find a diamond in the rough, but have always been disgustingly disappointed. I prefer a thinner crust pizza, not a fan of deep dish style pizzas!  I also don't mess with pizzas that are sopping in grease unless it's 2am in Downtown Scottsdale. Grimaldi's seems to have mastered the perfect crust thickness, which allows you to appreciate the flavors of your pizza toppings. The pizzas at Grimaldi's are delicious. Like eat a whole pie to yourself delicious! Pesto, white, or red sauce bases and tons of ingredients to customize a pizza. They have other things on the menu, which are also delicious, it's just hard to pay homage to them when the pizza is so unforgettable.   To top it all off, their service is excellent, great drink menu, beautiful bar area, and it is located in the cutest shopping plaza. This place is my #1 pick for pizza cravings. Try it, you will not be able to \"fugget-about-it\"!",

The meatballs alone were very flavorful and should be offered as an appetizer alone because they pair famously with the tomato sauce and cheese. Mmmmmmmm.

The dough is very thin and the oven makes the crust nice and crunchy without being too harsh on the senses. I have been to this location a few times over the years and I have always had a pleasurable experience from the food, to the staff, to the environment. There are some TV's that usually have good sports on, the lighting is light and warm, and the food if always spot on. Both the red and white pizzas are solid but I prefer the red as its not quite as rich. They offer multiple topping options from olives (black and kalamata), to onions, to meats (pepperoni, sausage, meatballs), and basil. Also, the oven is in plain sight so you can watch as your pizza is being made.",

Our server Austin is why it's only a 4 star. He was good, but didn't check up on us seemed like he was having a rough day. Service was just slow compared to normal.  Pizza and drinks are delicious! We get the white garlic pizza with onions, meatballs, and ricotta. Don't forget to ask your server for the garlic salt, Parmesan, and oregano to put on top of your already delicious pizza! They don't have ranch, which I think is great so you can taste the food!  Bloody Mary here is amazing I like it extra spicy! Still slowly trying out the rest of the drinks but overall we love this pizza spot and we will be back!",

Don't forget to sign up for their email notifications since you get a free one topping pizza up to $19.00 (they say it's for 16\"and one topping pizza but you can always upgrade to the larger pizza and just pay the difference ~$2.00)",

You can taste a little of the coal flavor on the crust and that makes it unique.  I highly recommend this place.",

Even my boyfriend was half tempted to run over to Barro's Pizza and buy a couple side ranches to bring back. Lol I asked the manager why they didn't have ranch and he said it's because the owners feel that pizza shouldn't be eaten with ranch. Well good for you owners, glad you have a stick up your bum and don't want to let your customers enjoy food the way they want it. Yes I'm making a stink over ranch and I'm fine with it. You should be able to eat food the way you'd like. Stop dictating my taste buds! Why have salt and pepper shakers? Why have oregano, red pepper flakes or parmesan cheese? Why not just change the menu and have one pizza, only made one way? Why have choices at all? Okay now that I'm done ranting I will say the pizza was excellent. It was. I will admit it. But I still want my ranch damn it! Ranch would have made it even better. Hm! Oh..and while the pizza was really good it's waaaaay over priced. It's pizza guys, pizza.",

Coal fired, with water adjusted to NY mineral levels shows great attention to the crust. However the sauce while not sweet it lacks flavor it could some some basil, oregano and or garlic. The cheese is great however.   We had a large cheese pizza $18.99 a bit steep but not terrible for a sit down gourmet esque. However due to the thin thin nature and blobs of cheese there is less overall pizza than other thin crust places like NYPD.  This place has a long laundry list of toppings, this is why I think the sauce lacked flavor as most don't miss it when they add on a whole meals worth of meat and veggies to a pizza.  The menu is simple salads pizza stomboli's and desert.   Overall its a decent option for a nicer pizza in this area of town.",

    "text": "I'd been hearing rave reviews and saw the billboards showcasing that they were highly rated in the valley so I decided to give their pizza a try.  I invited my sister to join me for dinner and we must've missed the lunch rush as there were only about 3-4 tables occupied when I sat down on 11/28/15.  My sister was running late so I asked for some bread and it never made it to the table so I asked again later.  We asked for water and had questions about the menu and the server said he would be back.  I noticed that the server was also the bartender and wasn't sure why the other 3-4 workers weren't helping patrons.  The cost of the restaurant is a bit pricey for me so I thought maybe the quality and service would justify it.    The restaurant started getting busier and we heard another hostess go over the specials which did not happen with me.  My sister and I started laughing because they started getting busier and after about 10 minutes, we made a decision to leave.  We did let the bartender know we changed our mind and we were leaving which I thought would've prompted a question about why but that never happened.  We walked past the hostess and she never said good night or anything as we left.  I can't really review the food or drinks as we were only able to get bread and water.    I am a big believer in letting the business know when there is an issue before posting a negative review so they have an opportunity to make it right.  I called the restaurant on our way to Picazzo's down the street and spoke with the manager.  He did apologize but my concern was that he never asked for my name or for an opportunity to make it right.  I would've expected for him to ask for another chance or asked for us to return at a later date so he could do something to fix our bad experience. Maybe we just hit them on a bad day but Picazzo's was amazing, more attentive, cheaper, had happy hour specials, and was delicious.",

You have the choice to build your own pizza or chose from one of their suggestions.  The small is quite large and can easily be shared between 2 people.  If you're super hungry, a large can also feed a party of 2 (with maybe 1 or 2 pieces to take home).    We always build our own pizza.  Our favorite is the \"white\" pizza - which basically means it has a lot of garlic and no red sauce on it.  I like to order: white pizza with mushrooms, pepperoni and dollops of ricotta cheese.  Perfectly delicious!  Service there is always great.    For kids, if you ask, they'll bring out pizza dough for them to play with.  Keeps them entertained for quite some time.",

I split a large garlic white crust with fancy olives, mushrooms, and mini pepperoni. It was plenty of pizza for two dudes. The small salad was a big proportion too.   My advice, eat it fast! Don't wait because the texture gets a bit rubbery.  Everyone should try a New York pizza.",

    "text": "We call this the \"good\" pizza place. Been here twice for take out only. The pizza is great and most of the employees that I've interacted with have been pretty nice as well.   Today I called and placed my order, when I came to pick it up, the order was wrong which is confusing because the girl on the phone read it back to me perfectly. And it was only two items- kinda hard to mess that up. Anyway, it was annoying, but not the end of the world. It just makes me have to wait longer.   The pizza does have great flavor. It also has a nice fire/char flavor to the crust. The slices are thin, but the pieces are large. I recommend getting an additional dressing if you get a salad to go. Half the lettuce literally had no dressing on it. The tiramisu is EXCELLENT. Seriously, get the tiramisu.   I would say that my biggest complaint is that it's pricey. $32 for a margherita pizza and a Cesar salad. It's close to home and it's the best option near me, so I'll likely continue to come here.",

    "text": "I came into grimaldis a few months back for my husbands birthday pizza. Both the service and the pizza were subpar. We had to send back our first pizza because it was a little more well done than we like. We decided to come back in for our sons free pizza. We started out with appetizers which we haven't had before. We got the Caesar salad (with salami and mozzarella suggested by our server) and an antipasti plate. They were both great! For our pizza we got a pepperoni, and another pizza half the don and half Brooklyn bridge. You must keep in mind that just because it is on half the pizza, it is not half the price, which we were ok with! I will start out by saying, the pizza was incredible. We had an amazing birthday celebration for our son. To top it all off, we had a dessert plate with a cannoli, slice of Tara Massoud, and strawberry cheesecake. The reason for this review was not to brag about all the amazing food we endured that night, but to also recognize our amazing server; Trisha went above and beyond to give us exceptional service. Everything from never letting our cups go dry, to the candle on our dessert plate. We had the chance to chat with her for a few and you can tell she is truly kind and also cares about what she is doing. A smile never left her face. I cannot wait to come back for future family and friend gatherings.",

Their staff had no idea when they sat us WITH menus and as a result our dinner plans were ruined,  unless we wanted to have salad for the next 45 minutes and blow off the rest of our plans. Explaining our frustration to the manager fell on deaf ears. He stated he didn't understand why we were so upset and that no other customers ever were upset about this. (While we were discussing, several other customers were seated with menus getting ready for the same rude suprise). He said this is just what they do from 4 to 5 everyday. When I suggested they put this on the door for folks to know, he said  it wouldn't make any difference, and I would still be in the same situation now, so what did it matter. (Kudos to my husband for not punching him in the face).  I explained to him that while people that work there are aware that nothing can be cooked from 4 to 5 that customers who aren't in the business may not be aware of that, and may not have the time to wait around. It's simply courteous to do so. This  seemed to be  a foreign concept to the manager  who said he had no plans of changing any process they have ,  was very rude and condescending ,  and didn't even seem to notice that the same thing was happening to several customers  sitting around us while we were speaking  being told they couldn't eat what they expected to come in to eat at that time either. He also didn't seem to be at all concerned that he'd lost  the business of customers  as a result  of his  attitude  and  inconsiderate approach to handling the situation. This restaurant projects itself as a high-end Eatery- they need a manager who can match that image. Will not be frequency again to this location and will alert everyone I know since he apparently has no plans to do so. Bottom line is Grimaldi's does not have any concern for schedules,  time or convenience of paying customers and we'll meet any voiced concern with condescension and rudeness.  On the flip side- Bucca de Beppos was willing to make me a calzone that's not even on the menu! And what delicious food, in and out quick and GREAT customer service. They are in the same plaza as Grimaldis...skip over to Bucca de Beppos instead for 100% great experience! Update: appears one of the waitresses left a nasty comment on this review.  Sealed the deal. Empowered women know their worth and demand the treatment they deserve",

Subway style signs and brick everywhere. There were 10 of us and they seated us pretty quickly and got our drinks.  Then we ordered. We were given dinner menus instead of lunch menus. You have to request the lunch menu. Found that out way after we ordered and saw a couple at another table get lunch menus. So we all paid dinner prices. Joy. For the smallest \"dinner\" size personal pizza costing $12, I hope its good.  My buddy ordered a plain cheese personal pizza. I one-upped him and ordered an extra cheese pizza. You know, the kind with a lot more cheese than the regular cheese pizza. After about an hours wait, we all got our pizzas. Absolutely NO difference in the cheese and extra cheese (other than the extra charge of $2) pizzas. We tried pointing this out the the waiter but they insisted mine had extra cheese and would not back down or go back and put extra cheese on it.   The crusts were super-thin. Almost cracker thin and hard to fold like a traditional New York stele pizza. The flavor was so-so.  So for $16 (x-tra cheese personal pizza with an iced tea) I got a small cracker with a little bit of sauce and a little bit of cheese that I had to wait for over an hour. Not cool. Major gyp. I could get something similar at Fired Pie for half the price. Or for the same price a real large pizza loaded with cheese on a real new york style crust at Buonos or Streets of New York.  So if you are one to throw good money away to be seen in a nice looking place. Go here. But if you want a good pizza at a fair price. Run away. Far away.",

It's the perfect amount of food, and of course the service is typically pretty great as well. If the other valley Grimaldi's were smart, they would offer these lunch specials too.",

While we were there she may have checked on us once with out us getting her attention. We went to her for out dessert and refills. The manager brought us over a box as well as our dessert when he asked how our meal was. We had to ask for our check and ask to pay our check!!!!!!!!  Seriously?  Our food however was amazing like always.  The butterscotch toffee cheesecake was delicious.   Never had service this poor here before.

    "text": "Grimaldi's is NY-style national pizza franchise that in my humble opinion should already inhabit every major US city.  Unfortunately they have not spread into my now-home state of Washington but the day they do I will be an immediate patron.  The only reason I can imagine how this particular location has been rated under 4 stars is that some people must not like incredible pizza or somehow had a very unusual bad experience due to astral conjunctions or recent brain trauma.  I LOVE PIZZA.  And I have NEVER had a better pizza than a Grimaldi's.  Their concept is simple:  pick a pizza type (there are 3: red, white, pesto), then pick your toppings (there are many).  And I guarantee you that if you are not satisfied, one of the excellent managers (the chief being Ahn, one of my favorite restaurant managers of all time) will address your concerns and respond accordingly.  The staff is always friendly, knowledgable, and prompt.  Now can we get back to the food?  If you like power-spicy-loaded pizzas, try this one.  Red sauce, Italian sausage, onion, green pepper, jalepeno.  If you absolutely need another topping, go pepperoni or maybe a fave veggie depending on your temperament.  And I guarantee (again) that the house carries at least one wine that will pair very nicely with your pie selection.  Grimaldi's management goes out of their way to train even the least wine-knowledgable servers (some are under 21) how to advise on wine pairing selections.  With the above-mentioned pizza I recommend a strong red in the cabernet to zinfandel range.  Their white wine selection is equally diverse, and there are always 6-7 solid taps for the beer enthusiast.  Now about the Happy Hour.  It does not exist BUT DO NOT FRET.  The house red and white are both priced at $4, ALL DAY, ALL WEEK.  Beers are also reasonably priced.  Last I was there, liquor was not an option.  Please do not skip on this incredible pie for that reason; this is a mistake.  This is the best pizza in Arizona.  Want a salad?  No problem.  There are numerous delicious options.  Want dessert?  I have one word for you:  Tiramisu.  Cheesecakes also rarely disappoint.  Even if this Tempe location is too far for you to drive, there are 5 other Phoenix locations that carry the same incredible quality.  Caveat:  You usually cannot get a pizza between 4pm and 5pm because they must re-stoke the coal ovens.  This is a fact that has miffed a few customers over the years but is a necessary fact of coal-oven pizza making.  Trust me, it is worth the wait.  4.7 stars!  Best bartender:  Ellie, assuming she still works there.  Rock N Roll baby",

Every time I eat here I have to tell my family it reminds me of the pizza in Italy.  We probably dine here every other week or more, the pizza is consistently done well. I really like the thin crunchy crust, light tomato sauce, high quality cheeses and meat toppings. We always get a salad or two, all the salads are delicious especially the Caesar.  The house red wine is a great value and a great accompaniment to pizza.  The cannoli and tiramisu are simple but some of the best!",

Tuesday's half off wine night is our favorite but every time we come we've had amazing service, even better food and an overall great time. Tonight Austin was our server and he's also fabulous! They're really doing something right here! We'll be back next Tuesday if we haven't found an excuse to come sooner!",

The pizza is EXCELLENT... having the open kitchen makes you want to order more even when you just can't seem to get another slice down. We used to go to the other location on queen creek until they closed now we come to the one on Ray Rd.  The prices are very reasonable two large pies will feed about 8 persons with two pieces each....but I'm sure three pies wouldn't hurt. Anyway, thank you Grimaldi staff for making a great pizza and providing such good service!!",

I also ordered GF pizza only comes in 1 size. Which is 12\" size. I would have liked it to come in a smaller size or more to offer for GF. My pizza was $15 alone for a lunch, it was tasty just pricy for lunch.",
