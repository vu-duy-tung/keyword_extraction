The food was delicious, I really enjoyed the cocktail soju that they had. It was sweet and went along really well with the bulgogi Nachos that we ordered. The staff was very attentive and helpful and answered any questions that we had about food or anything else.  They also have karaoke which I found to be a nice touch and added to the friendly atmosphere they had going on.  I will definitely be going back soon!",

We liked the seafood pancake.  Unless it is a common practice, they automatically charge an 18% service charge for a party of 4, my wife and I and my two kids.  Never go here again.  Great alternative would be Gogi or Hodori.",

Obviously our night of celebrations were disrupted  when we had to wait thirty minutes before we can Karaoke. We ended our night disappointed due to some awkward rule that's place by management. My only question is \"has anyone ever gone a to karaoke place where it limits karaoke singing to 30 minutes and wait 30\"?",

First off this place is a bar, wouldn't say kid friendly by any means, they ask you to request water refills when they can just ask if you would like more water, what a conundrum?  The pot stickers were great, most times they are boiled, these were pan fried and crispy, the fire chicken was to hot and to be honest I didn't enjoy it at all.  The star of the show was the Korean red wings, these were so flavorful sweet with a hint spicy, great taste.  Last was the galbi spare ribs, $20 they were good, I don't think it was worth $20 but it was worth trying once.  This seems like a good place to hang and get food with friends after getting drunk somewhere else.  Probably won't be going back here but the wings were awesome!",

When our food came, in a timely manner, the bao was decent but had very little meat and the ramen was basically the kind you buy for $90 cents with a few veggies thrown in.

We ordered the KFC (Padak style), Bulgogi Nachos, Spicy Pork & Kim Chi/Bacon Fried Rice.  Well, the KFC was ok, a bit dry, but I can look past that since it is white meat...but to add green onions, it's $2.00 more...don't get me wrong...I don't mind paying, but for what we got and the quality, not as much.  The Bulgogi nachos were ok, nice intro of some fusion there.  The spicy pork was really good though, that's why I can say I would go back.  The Kim Chi/Bacon fried rice was ok, would like to have had more kim chi though.  I would definitely recommend, because the overall quality is worth it and the server was fairly attentive, considering he had a full house and he was basically the only server for a bit.  Then another waitress showed up, so it helped.",

They didn't give us a menus until 10 minutes later and we had to ask for one. They only gave us two menus for our party of four. We ordered appetizers and drinks and that took another 15 minutes. They didn't have their watermelon drink and that was disappointing. Twenty minutes later we were asked if we wanted to order and we ordered the Udon, Korean Fried chicken and Orange Flavored Chicken. All of us are not experts at using chop sticks so we asked for forks. The waiter came back with spoons because they ran out of forks. There was a large group having dinner, but how could you run out of forks. The food was dry and chewy. The room was dark and looked a bit dirty. There  were wine glasses hanging above  the bar that had a thick dirty built up. We will not return.",

We also got the Bulgogi fries, corn cheese and chicken wings. The fries were crunchy and would satisfy those late night cravings. The portion of the fries are huge so you can order one and share it amongst your friends. The corn cheese was tasty and the  chicken wings had a nice kick of spice",

It is a dimly lit restaurant. But the food is delicious, the portions are huge, and they blast kpop, which is the fastest way to my heart.  The real showstopper here is the cheese corn. Which sounds like a venereal disease, but I promise you, it is one of the greatest things I've ever eaten. It's so melty and salty and kind of sweet and greasy and amazing. Their bulgogi is also quite superb and you can tell it's authentic.  The table I was sitting at felt wobbly, the chairs were horrible, and the service was a little slow (there was only one server for the whole restaurant and I could tell he was being overworked) so that's the only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5.   Overall, this is a solid place and it is 100% worth your money and time. I may have left without the Korean hunk that I was looking for, but I did leave with a full belly and a soju buzz. And that's really all a girl can ask for  \\_()_/ ",

We also did the Soju basket bundle which came with 5 beers so enough for a big group to share. We also ordered Dduk Boki which was satisfying especially for those of you who love spicy food!   We also did the Watermelon Soju which was very yummy! The sprinkle fruity pebbles and pop rocks on it too which makes it pretty and fun. Don't think it's worth $22 though because you cannot even taste the Soju.   I would love to come back and try other items on their menu!",

I sat at the bar; small selections, but I can make do.  My buddy joined me tonight and we were intrigued by the fusion of American bar food and Korean bites.  We started withe Bulgogi Cheese Fries along with some Korean Fried Chicken.  My buddy also ordered their Ramen.  Starting with the fries I was definitely excited to try!  Needless to say, the fries were cooked well and crunchy with the cheese oozing, but I rather find it lacking in the Bulgogi department. (Insert Sad Emoji)  As we proceeded with the Fried Korean Chicken; pretty much popcorn chicken with a side of sweet and spicy sauce and chipotle mayo.  I can see how the chicken would work as beer food.  In the end, Drunken Tiger is a cool spot, but it just didn't do it for me.  I like the concept, but definitely needs more crafting in their part.  I rather enjoyed my quick visit, but we'll see if there's a come back! - Enjoy!",

That is precisely what I am doing now.  I shared the watermelon soju with the boyfriend and got pretty buzzed, but boyfriend didn't feel anything. Apparantly there's one entire bottle of soju in the \"bowl\" according to the waiter. My boyfriend says next time we come to request they double the amount of soju.  Definitely the closest thing you can get in Arizona that compares to Koreatown in Los Angeles. I mean, obviously it's nothing like actual Ktown but it's OK.  The watermelon soju comes with a baggie of Poprocks. Also, I asked for a cup of extra Fruity Pebbles and it was not a problem at all.  Great place for my birthday drink! If any girlfriends come to visit me in Arizona (ha.. ha... haaa) then I'll definitely bring them here.

But it got kind of loud once that business started going down.  Will definitely check it out again.",

    "text": "According to legend, 5,000 years ago a Chinese empress discovered silk when a silkworm cocoon fell into her tea. Here at Drunken Tiger, you can find silkworms in your soup!  What a fun filled night with Adam A., Karen W., her husband David, Grace O. (Nice to finally meet ya, missy!), and Glenn! There was a parade of three popcorn chicken dishes (the Padak Chicken coming with green onions and different sauces), KBBQ, a seafood pancake, Bulgogi fries, and a steamy stinky bowl of silkworm pupae soup. Most of the bites were pretty delicious, especially the Bulgogi fries, but that silkworm soup... I can't say I'm a fan. Grace describes it best by comparing the texture to soft shell crab. The taste? It tastes like it smells and it smells pretty bad. For $10, you too can have the same experience! If anything, the silkworms look freaky as heck and will give you the shivers.  We also shared a watermelon soju that Grace and I ended up taking over. To be fair, there didn't seem to be much soju. The Fruity Pebbles were fun when they were crunchy but got soggy at the end. We also liked the Pop Rocks that came with our drink.  I felt like I was in Willy Wonka! \"Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination...\"  Drunken Tiger is a fun place to go with a group of pals. Stop by for their Happy Hour and enjoy some decent eats!  There's a limited quantity of watermelon soju so plan accordingly!",

    "text": "Fun fact: Drunken Tiger is the name of a famous Korean hip-hop band that made their debut in 1999.  Review 9/10 for the 10 bookmarked businesses to review before the end of 2016! From Meagan B.'s thread: <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/topic/phoenix-yelp-phoenixs-10-firsts-of-2016\">yelp.com/topic/phoenix-y...</a>  The menu at Drunken Tiger is fairly similar to its predecessor Cafe Agit with a few more bar food type foods thrown into the mix like nachos and fries. We ordered a ton of food, most of it some sort of fried chicken. The padak chicken had a light crispy batter with the requisite curly strips of green onion on top, served with a wasabi/horseradish soy sauce and a creamier sweet sauce. The popcorn chicken was essentially the same as the padak but with different dipping sauces (A sweet chile sauce and another creamy sauce). The grilled meats we had were the kalbi and spicy pork. The kalbi had a good marinade on it and had a nice proportion of meat on the platter. The spicy pork was tender, well seasoned and I liked how it actually delivered on the spiciness level unlike other Korean restaurants where there is barely a whiff of chile pepper in their \"spicy\" marinated grilled meat.  I did make a special request for bulgolgi fries which were essentially the fries version of their bulgolgi nachos. The fries had a light crispness, smothered in gooey cheese and topped with olives, pico de gallo, jalapenos, and chopped up bulgolgi. It tasted great overall and was a huge portion but I do wish I could taste a little more of the bulgolgi flavor and meat in the meal.   We also ordered some seafood pancake which was generously filled with seafood, with a crispy crust to contrast with the softer textures of the filling.   Our Bizarre Foods moment came when someone ordered the silkworm soup. It came out piping hot, and had a weird funky aroma to me. I figured hey, I'll try almost anything once so why not try this? I was handed two silkworms on my plate. I examined them and tried to ignore the fact that they looked like something that I pay an exterminator to get rid of every month. The actual broth they were \"cocooned\" in was bold and fiery. I bit into a corner of a silkworm to find it was too chewy and chitinous for my tastes so I just ended up swallowing them whole like a bitter pill, following each swallow with a copious amount of soju. Even though I wasn't really a fan of the soup I appreciate that they offer this dish to those that do enjoy it!  Now the soju... It was served in a gigantic hollowed out watermelon, blended with fresh watermelon pulp and juice, topped with Fruity Pebbles and Pop Rocks. Truly a sight to behold and a combination that makes you wonder if someone had been on a mind-bending substance while thinking of this drink (Or maybe they had eaten too many silkworms that day). I liked the fresh watermelon but I don't think there was a lot of soju in the actual drink since I was feeling barely anything after a few rounds.  There was a mix up as we were initially served a regular bulgolgi plate instead of the fries, and I did have to remind the server about a missing drink order, but the server was apologetic and provided friendly service.   The interior seems pretty much the same was Cafe Agit, with various TV screens either playing a game or K-Pop.  Overall I think this a great option for late night eats or if you want Korean food for dinner. There were a good number of people seated here on a Friday night having conversations in Korean which is always a good sign that the food and beverage here is legit. We had a good time and I'll be back again for more food!",

I been here a couple of times and out of all those times I was invited by a friend. The food is above average but for the price they are charging, no thank you. I think their Korean fried chicken here is better than most in Arizona I been to so far and there other food taste about the same as Hidori I would say.",

The Korean red sweet and spicy perfectly fried wings are lust worthy. The spicy squid was also sauced and prepared just right, all it needs is a side of white rice.

After being seated, our server left us to help other tables who came in AFTER us for 10 minutes without giving us menus so we just sat there and waited (the tables who came in after us got served and left way before us). When he finally gave us our menus, he made us wait another 20 minutes before letting us order (at this point we were ready to leave but decided to stick it out cause you never know if the food is going to be amazingly good). After ordering, our food took ages to arrive and when it did, it came in waves and was mediocre at best. Additionally, we couldn't even start eating until 5 minutes after because our server, yet again, took his time to give us plates, prioritizing other tables over a simple task that should have been completed long before.  tl;dr horrible service and mediocre food, save your time and go somewhere else. Gogi and Koreatown are so much better and will actually serve you.",

At some point, the owner came by to make sure everything was OK and threw in some extra appetizers! Service was amazing, drinks were great, food was great. Come here. Bring your friends.",

We consumed lots of rice wine and yogurt soju, and ate several plates of satisfying Korean drinking food, including cheese corn (where have you been all my life?) and tteokbokki (the grown-up comfort food of my dreams), all while listening to K-pop, and therefore had an all-around great time. We'll probably be back within the week. Two thumbs up-slash-five stars for our new favorite bar!",

Therefore, this place is the most expensive Korean restaurant in PHX area! The waitress explained that they serve \"Korean Street Food\", really? Street food with fine dinning price? Let's talk about the food now. If I don't know this a Korean place, I would say it is a Chinese restaurant because I don't taste garlic at all which is the signature taste for Korean food. Oh, by the way, the portion is so small that we had to go to Burger King to get some chicken nuggets. Nevertheless, got robbed once, never again!",

Their Bulgogi is very flavorful and well cooked. It's thinly sliced  marinated beef, that is slightly sweet, and has a soy based saltiness. Along with green onions, and normal onions. The corn cheese is their take on elotes. It's served on a hot plate, with mozzarella, pepper, and green onions. They also have a fire version that's spicy and has pork belly added to it! The pot stickers comes with 7 on a bed of cabbage, drizzled with spicy mayo. They are deep fried. And delicious! The veggie stir fry with sausage is kinda spicy. The veggies consist of cabbage, carrot, onions. The sausage are slices are nicely sized. Thick, but still comfortable enough to eat in one bite. It comes with rice, so you have something to eat it with.  Over all I have always been satisfied, taste wise and full wise! The servers are friendly and will help explain any dishes you might not be sure about. The food gets out fast too. This is deff place where you get multiple plates and share with the people at your table. But don't let that discourage you if it's just you and another person. My boyfriend and I come here, just us, all the time. I would recommend this place to anyone, and I do! :)",

    "text": "Came here for dinner with my boyfriend on a Wednesday night. It wasn't crowded so we lucked out since we heard it gets busy. We got seated right away by a sweet waitress. She was friendly and able to answer our questions. We had water to start, which they provide a bottle for to refill your cup until you run out and they will replace. We had a total of 4 dishes to share among 2 and we were able to finish!   - Galbi: this dish came with rice and a side of kimchee. I liked the flavoring but they were a bit overcooked because of the charred pieces all over the meat that overpowered the meat portion on the ribs. Kimchee wasn't spicy, but that was fine. The rice allowed us to eat the rest of our dinner with so it was a good choice with the meat dish. - Silk worm pupae soup: I would never order this without knowing its exceptional, but my boyfriend wanted to try a new dish so we opted in for this versus the usual kimchee stew flavored soups. I will say it isn't bad but also not good enough for us to reorder. My boyfriend said the silkworms were soft since they sit in the soup for awhile, which grossed me out so I only drank the soup and the corn bits. - Corn cheese with pork belly: this dish was double its price when we added the pork belly, but also something we never tried so we opted for it. It was a large size for the cheese corn and pork belly pieces on top. I liked the addition of the green onions too. I love cheese corn for those that know me, so I loved this dish. It also had additional flavoring from the pork belly, greens onions, and strong flavor of white pepper too. I would reorder but can go without pork belly next time for a cheaper price.  - Chicken wings (Korean red): everyone that has been here rave about the wings so we had to try. We should have tried the garlic option, but we went for the Korean red since it had a hint of spice. It wasn't really spicy, but the crispiness of the chicken remained even though there was sauce all over which is awesome. The chicken was also juicy vs dry. Would return just to order the chicken wings and try their other flavors.   Half the dishes came out good, and half didn't. We will have to return to give it another try since this place received such praise among our friends. Left paying around $65 for two people including tips and tax.",

Their drinks are super good! Their watermelon soju is super refreshing and perfect for the Arizona heat! It may seem like their food is a little pricey but to me I think it is reasonable. If you are not willing to spend at least $20 here then that's a personal problem. Don't complain about prices being too high when it's just you who can't afford it. Dt's customer service is always amazing and make sure that you are comfortable and happy. Their servers are always checking on bathrooms and tables to make sure they are clean. Honestly I would recommend this pub to everyone and their mothers. If you're reading this make sure to stop by Drunken Tiger because I promise you, you won't regret it.",

Mesa doesn't have a lot of cool, hip places to eat so our expectations were low. We were pleasantly surprised.  This Korean restaurant has a young, trendy vibe with it's black-walled interior and K-POP videos.  This place is perfect for date night or drinks with friends.    I have to say though that the food is a little pricey and took a while to come out. I do love that they try not to be wasteful.  They don't fill up your water unless you ask and they don't serve you kimchi unless you want it. Kimchi is kind of like the Japanese equivalent of wasabi or ginger, something that is served on the side of most dishes but never gets eaten. I asked for the kimchi because I've never had it and wanted to try it. I took one bite and I was NOT a fan.  I kind of felt terrible for wasting it...  Overall, my husband and I had a good time and enjoyed our food.    CAUTION: Your clothes will reek of Korean BBQ when you get home. Whether that's good or bad, that's up to you.",

We ordered:  1. Fire Chicken -- super spicy chicken with cheese on top. Very good, but prepared to ask for another jug of water to go with it.   2. Bulgogi Fries -- heaping portion of it, it was great but the bulgogi portion was so small and chopped it. I wish they were in bigger pieces. Don't think I'd order again.   3. Tteok Kochi? -- slightly pan-fried rice cakes with this red sauce that had peanuts in it. LOVE this dish. These rice cakes are different than the regular tteokbokki dish since this one isn't really spicy at at all.   Service was excellent, everyone came by and ask how our food was, and was super friendly.   I would give this place 4.5 stars, and I'll just round up to 5 on Yelp since their service was great, and I definitely will come back.",

    "text": "We tried this place for the first time tonight for dinner. We had heard great comments & saw how busy it was day after day for quite some time. We thought, let's give it a try! We were a party of 4 & arrived an hour after opening. We had walked in & the place was already fairly packed. We weren't approached to be seated right away ,instead were told we could sit in the middle area. Five minutes after sitting our waiter came over with 2 menus & we were told they didn't have enough menus for everyone. We all ordered cocktails & literally 10 minutes later they brought over the drinks. After we all took a sip it was another 10 minutes till our waiter came back to take half our order. Our appetizers slowly trickled out, one by one. We were brought 3 plates instead of 4 & were told all of the forks were dirty so none were available. The potstickers & mozzarella sticks had good flavor, but I didn't understand the ketchup dip for the mozzarella sticks. Weird combo.  We never were checked on while our food was cooking. Once the food came out it wasn't at all what we were expecting. Everything was fried & very little sauce if none on all the food.   All 4 of us were so very unhappy with our experience. We said to each other, we should have just walked over to Macayo's instead. Our final review is, terrible service, horrible food that leaves you feeling unhealthy & greasy, all ending with a $50 tab.  Needless to say, none of us will be returning. But now we have our own opinion everytime we pass by.",

    "text": "Horrible place, horrible owners. They wanted us to spend at least $10 per person before you can karaoke because it's \"too expensive\" for them otherwise. We were $8 shy of $10 per person and they wouldn't let us karaoke. We went there to drink and karaoke, I called ahead of time and they told me they have karaoke the whole time so we went. Biggest mistake. If you're looking to have fun and drink with friends, don't go there. Their greed ruined our night. I don't know who goes to a bar and immediately spends $50 upon arrival. I get it, we weren't eating but we were definitely planning on being there awhile. They eventually told us we can karaoke for $5 a song, which to me is ridiculous since they say they offer it, but no where does it say you have to be up to a $10 bill per person before you can sing. I think they are just money hungry and would rather rip people off then try to be an honest business. I have never been treated so badly I don't know how this place is even open still since the other reviews say the food is pretty bad.  In the reply from the owner he says I stayed and drank one tower for 2 hours. But we were waiting for friends to show up before ordering. Idk how you expect us to finish any sooner? We would have ordered more if they were nicer to us. I didn't want anything free we just wanted a place to hang out and drink. It's funny they can't decide if they're a restaurant or a bar. If you're named \"Drunken tiger \" why would you say you're more of a restaurant when even the menu is drink based like \"drunk munchies\" it makes no sense with the theme of the bar or restaurant whatever you want to call yourselves today. I didn't curse I just wanted to leave. I also didn't even really talk to either of you, your waiter was super friendly and understood where we were coming from. Too bad because we were enjoying ourselves for awhile at first. You can say it's on camera but I don't really care. I just hope others come and can enjoy without being treated like we were.",

There was little bulgolgi and quite expensive ($19.99). I got the boneless Korean fried chicken (KFC) because my friend said it is usually really good at other places. It was nothing special. Just regular popcorn chicken only with a dipping sauce not so flavorful.   There is dish that has rice cake and you can add egg, ramen noodles and cheese to it. That was pretty good however the sauce is really thick and sweet. I just mainly liked it because of the rice cakes.   My most favorite thing here is the takoyaki. It is always so weird how whenever I go to a restaurant, one of the things that become my favorite there are always the food outside of the ethnic group. The takoyaki was delicious but the fish flakes did not move around much. It barely moved actually, I do not know why...   I find it weird how they call dumplings \"potstickers\" at this place... There is an automatic 18% service charge fee at the end. Did not get to take a picture of the rice cake!",

However, I always come back every few months thinking that they may have improved. So I was craving Korean fried chicken and thought I would give this place another try. However, I was extremely disappointed. It was nothing like the traditional yang yum chicken I was used too. What happened? They used to make this somewhat decently. The flavors here seem inconsistent. This time the yang yum chicken didn't taste anything like what I was expecting. For one, I was expecting crispy fried chicken with bones still in and a slightly sweet, yet spicy sauce. However, what I got was a soggy mess of popcorn chicken with a salty, spicy sauce. I also got the fried rice. It was super heavy and hard to digest. It didn't taste like kimchi fried rice at all. There was barely any kimchi, and I got mostly the hard end bits that I would never serve a guest. I guess that is what I get for ordering at a bar.",

We got the bulgogi ($17ish) and bulgogi fries ($12). The food wasn't warm enough and got cold pretty fast :/ the bulgogi fries had good cheesy fries but the fries tasted a little stale. Minus 1 star.  Overall, I like the atmosphere of this place. The concept of the Karaoke is really cool and I like that it's dark in there. It is good beer food, but not that great if you're sober.",

Although it's pretty expensive. The fries were $16.99. They have Tteokokki which is a Korean noodle dish that you can add different stuff like cheese, egg, noodles, and etc. The price for that was ($10.99) Koreans generally have there signature spicy red sauce so it was on a lot of my friends meals such as my friends Korean Fried Chicken and Kimchi Friend Rice. For myself I got Takoyaki which are ball shaped snack that has tempura and octopus. It was okay the price for that was $6.99. It's a cute restaurant with a good environment like karaoke. I would only go for the Bulgogi Fries honestly.",

The cuisine is Korean street food and this is one of the few places where they have Korean rice wine. It's called makkoli. I highly recommend mixing it with some sprite. It's amazing. My friends and I ordered their watermelon punch drink and it was definitely worth it to at least try. The presentation is overwhelming, yet fun. They have ladles to scoop the drink up with the fruity pebbles and small cups. It wasn't strong but the flavor was good. We got the beef bulgogi, bao, cheesy corn and seafood pancake. It was just the right amount of food to share between three people. The bao is AMAZING here. The staff was friendly and accommodating.  I also like that they're authentic and play Korean music.  I highly recommend checking them out. They're located at a small shopping center in Mesa but it's worth the drive to at least try.",

Only thing they can do to improve it would be to add a bit more bulgogi. The second night I had the Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) and it was so delicious!! I recommend pairing it with soju or beer.

I love Korean culture, so I was excited to get to try some of the food, and I figured the watermelon soju would be a fun first bar experience. We tried a few different menu items, and although everyone was a little nervous to try flavors out of their comfort zones, they all loved it. I definitely had the best 21st birthday I could ever imagine! My recommendations would definitely be getting the bulgogi nachos, they're super good! And if you like fruity drinks and you're with a group that also like fruity drinks, the watermelon soju is worth trying for sure! My parents still talk about how much they enjoyed the seafood pancake. The chicken was delicious as well! Seriously, check this place out! It's a hidden gem! I definitely plan on coming back soon, and hopefully next time I'll get a chance to do a little karaoke and flaunt my Kpop skills.",

I can't get enough of it. Their service is often slow. Please know it's not because they are lazy or just don't care. It's because they are under staffed. I feel if there were more structure and a few more people. It would run so smoothly. The decor.... well everything is black. Feels dingy, college-y. Granted it's surrounded by college students. But you shouldn't be like this. In my opinion. Create an atmosphere that isn't shrouded in black. I really do enjoy this place but it's mainly because I am distracted by the company that I go with here. They've gotten to know the staff and they make it interesting and fun. The inconsistencies I'm sure will iron out in time and I can only assume so will the color scheme and atmosphere . I look forward to seeing this.",

Tried a variety of foods including pot stickers, sweet and sour chicken and sausage and veggie stir fry. My favorite of the three was the stir fry. It had a sweet and spicy taste that was blended perfectly together. The energetic Korean music played throughout the restaurant kept with the Korean theme. Can't wait to come back and check out the karaoke.",

They have a great variety of korean cuisine; such as traditional spicy rice cakes or something with a twist like their bulgogi fries. Drinks are fairly priced. There really isn't a better combination than korean fried chicken with a cold sip of soju to wash greasy goodness all down! A great first time experience that will keep my business coming!",

This is where I take all my out-of-town friends, where my friends and I catch up over drinks, I had my birthday dinner here...Once, I came here five times in a week with different people...and they're only open six days a week. Not sure if that's impressive or embarrassing haha.   But I've had a bunch of items on the menu. People say it's overpriced, but it's because the portions are meant for sharing. The Korean Fried Chicken or Soy Garlic Chicken is always a solid choice. I LOVE french fries so the Kimchi Pork Fries or Animal-style Fries (secret menu item) are both amazing.   If you're looking for something on the spicier side and not fried, my go-to items are the Tofu Kimchi (sounds bland, but is so tasty, especially with the pork belly mixed in) or the Spicy Mussels.   If you're looking for something a little more green, I recently tried the Pork Belly Salad and it was great! It had chopped up perilla leaves in it (which I love!) and it gave the salad a minty, bold taste.   I'm also a fan of the flavored sojus. Plum, white grape, and peach are my favorite!   I could write a novel about how much I love this place and everything else I've ordered, but I highly suggest trying yourself!",

Korean bar food with some American comfort food fusion like the bulgogi fries, which were pretty awesome. Spicy fire chicken was addicting, and the corn aka \"Korean elote\" was impressive. Spam and eggs, fried chicken are other items on the menu that are on my \"to try\" list.   We ordered makkoli (milky rice wine) and Soju (rice wine-much stronger than makkoli) and shared between 4 people, as well as a pitcher of Cass. Karaoke singers are comically terrible here, but I feel like that is part of the charm.   My only concern was that there were only two servers in the entire bar/restaurant so I had to hunt my server down every now and then. Service was friendly, so it wasn't a deal breaker. Also, there are only single person bathrooms, so it could be a bit of a line to use the bathroom when it's crowded.   Overall, I enjoyed myself and my friends who came along enjoyed a taste of Korean bar food. I can't wait to go back and hopefully the watermelon soju with fruity pebbles and pop rocks is in season!",

My usual order is their tteok kochi, soy garlic chicken, and either galbi or bulgogi. The tteok kocki is like a chewy rice ball in their spicy sauce. The soy garlic chicken is my favorite and is pure deliciousness. A fried chicken soaked in garlic sauce. Really everything on their menu is full of flavor. It can be a bit oily but that's what makes is sooo tasteful.  I highly recommended this place for a night out. ENJOY!!",

Lots of soju. Kpop videos on the screen. The food came out like mountains. They got great dishes here. The fried chicken is delicious with 4 sauces. The corn cheese with spicy pork was like kids eating candy. The Kalbi short rib was eaten so fast. I was very satisfied with the food washing it down with peach soju. After a few bottles we started singing karaoke on the tv screens. Good fun times with great food  Recommendation: corn cheese, kalbi short rib, fried chicken , and peach soju",

    "text": "Drunken Tiger took us last night!  First and foremost to clear things up: Drunken Tiger is a bar. It is a restaurant second. There were no other children but mine and it made things awkward. The walls are black, music loud and neon signs provided more light then the lightbulbs... it was 5pm. Very fun if your with friends , not toddlers. :/  First order of business, appetizers. We decided on the Fire Chicken, fried potstickers and chicken wings.  Fire Chicken: WAY TOO HOT. Made me sick all night HOT. Heartburn all night HOT. We could not eat it and beware when ordering. Potstickers: so much better fried than steamed, we had to actually order 2 because the first round was so yummy and my son ate most of them.  Chicken wings: the BEST you will ever eat. They are spicy yet tangy and are breaded to perfection. We should have ordered more because those were the star of the show!  For entree we ordered the $19.99 Korean spare ribs which were not the best, not the highlight of the evening. The portion was eerily small compared to the price tag of the plate and after eating the wings, the comparison was steep. Also, the service is crazy slow, literally 1 server for 9 tables.  Overall, we ate here once and truth be told, we won't return.",

I had a little of different things during my previous times, but the most recent, I ate the 12 Fried Chicken piece (garlic Parmesan flavor) for $15.99 and drank Cass beer with it. It's like a complete Korean experience right there since fried chicken and beer is a \"common tradition\" in South Korea. When I was over there, we literally went to a bunch of fried chicken and beer places over the course of our stay. Heck, we even had friend chicken and beer delivered to our apartment. lol.  So it was awesome to experience fried chicken and beer again. The chicken was extremely flavorful and tender. And you can literally taste the crunchy garlic on top of the chicken. It was so crunchy! And of course, drinking the Korean brand, Cass, beer completes the experience.  It's a little pricey but the food is good. The restaurant is also a little short staffed but I don't know if there is another Korean restaurant in the valley like this one. It's one of a kind at the moment.",

Sometimes the meat itself can be a bit dry but overall it's satisfying.   Their menu mainly consists of Korean bar food. Aside from the yang nyam, I've only had the bulgogi fries. It's worth trying out but it's nothing to get too excited for. Drinks wise - get the yoju (yogurt soju). Their flavored soju can be a watered down, but it does the job if you're pregaming.  Service is not bad but somewhat understaffed. Parking lot has a decent amount of space. Overall good place to try out.",

On our recent visit we ordered the Spicy Mussels & the Spicy Pork Belly Kimchi Fries. The portions were large and the quality was amazing. They also had an awesome happy hour special on drinks (we ordered Cass!) The environment is dark and they offer table/booth/bar and outside seating. The restuarant is filled with upbeat K-POP music coming from a karaoke system with several large TVs playing music videos. The crowd is diverse mostly with younger adults having a good time and connecting over delicious food/drinks. My friends and I have had almost everything on the menu and really recommend this place if you're looking for something open late night, with a great vibe and amazing food!",

The watermelon soju was also good, but watermelon was not seedless so that was disappointing. The nachos and fries were both good as well. Overall this was a good find for guilty food pleasures. I'd definitely recommend the wings, and I'm not usually a big chicken wing fan! The atmosphere was cool and the service was good.",

    "text": "Ok so im giving 3 stars because the food was fresh tasting but i will not be coming back here. The food (for lack of better wording) didnt taste very Korean. I should have known pretty much when I asked about the Korean sides along with the Korean barbecue and the waiter explained that they are not a traditional Korean restaurant and did not serve the Korean barbecue with sides. We got beef bulgogi and fried rice. In the past when I've gotten fried rice Korean restaurants (which isn't very often) but when I do get it it taste Korean like it doesn't taste like Chinese fried rice it has a special Korean flavor. The beef bulgogi tasted like when I try to make Chinese stir fry at home. It did not have the Korean flavor it just tasted like meat with soy sauce. It was expensive for what it was. Part of me wanted to send it back but I came with my two year old and he was hungry and had already started eating the food. They had some other interesting things on the menu so perhaps they are more focused on these special items and less on Korean food or flavors. The waiter was in charge of the whole restaurant as well as the bar so the service was not great but he was very nice. Also, when we order the fried rice the waiter said that it had peanuts in it and asked if that was okay and I said yeah. I was not aware that it would be so full of peanuts. There was a disproportionate amount of peanuts compared to Rice. It is unpleasant to have 5 peanuts per bite of rice. I will post a picture.",

The staff is always nice and attentive (if they are busy they will let you know and apologize ahead of time for the wait). My staples are the corn cheese (which is like crack I can't stop eating it) and the Korean Fried Chicken pre-tossed, the bao are very good as well the bread is very sweet and fluffy and the pork belly is cooked perfectly to accompany it. This is a good place to have some drinks and enjoy good food with friends. One of the better Korean places in town.",

    "text": "I've been to Drunken Tiger twice so far, my bf and I had a great experience. Their service was excellent and the food was amazing! The place itself is quite dark because they do have a bar so that's probably why.  Our first visit, we ordered Tteobokki, Fire Chicken and Soysauce Garlic Popcorn Chicken. - Tteobokki was good! You can't go wrong with tteobokki!  - Fire Chicken, okay this menu is definitely fire! But for some reason, it's not as bad as the Korean fire noodle (Samyang), I can't finish Samyang but I was able to finish the chicken, so it's not bad. - Soysauce Garlic Popcorn Chicken, this menu is AMAZING. Gosh, I wish it was less than $15 for a plate, I can eat this everyday. This popcorn chicken is so good, you can definitely taste the soysauce and garlic, in a good way, so flavorsome!  Our second visit, we ordered Bulgogi and I wanted to order Fire Chicken but I asked the waiter if I could request for the chicken to be fried because I don't like the way it is on my first visit, the server then told me if I want, I could order their popcorn chicken and they will give the \"fire sauce\", so I said ok cool, let's do that. - Bulgogi, it's a classic. It comes with rice. RESPECT! It was my bf's first time trying Bulgogi and he liked it a lot. He said the beef was so tender and juicy. I tried it as well and it's a good Bulgogi, at least in my opinion. Everyone has different taste and it's okay! - Popcorn Chicken with fire sauce, okay I'm not going to lie, the fire sauce was definitely not the same with the one that comes in Fire Chicken menu. I understand it very well but I can't eat it because all I could taste was the very strong Korean chili paste (Go Chu Jang) and it was hard to enjoy it. I'm glad they gave me the other dip, like a sweet sauce dip and it was so delicious!  I love their food a lot, I'd say it tastes very authentic. It is more on the higher price but their food is worth it. My bf and I will definitely be coming back here again.",

This came with spicy dip and mayonnaise.  5 beer bucket: tried all Korean beers on the menu. Kloud was my favorite of all 5.   Patio has a water view and cold breeze is just awesome during evenings.

Fries and nachos covered with chorizo marketed as Korean pork because it had some mayo and green onions on it. Takoyaki is clearly japanese, good, but still japanese. Their special was lumpia which is Filipino and was lacking. Everything tasted good I guess, not enough to come back. The overall vibe of this place was very confusing. Service wasnt very attentive,  the waitress couldn't answer my questions and everything came out at once which was overwhelming. Food was okay but I don't think I'll be returning.",

Keeping my eyes on the doorway I just told myself to focus on the food and not worry about it.   This time around we went with the Salt & Pepper Shrimp, Boneless Korean Fried Chicken, Kimchi Fried Rice and yes, a Good Day drink (which ain't cheap, but damn near sneaks up on you when drinking). 1st time having the Kimchi Fried Rice (with Bacon... yes, everything with BACON is good) and it definitely blew me away. Salt & Pepper shrimp was also on point. Definitely a great late night spot with a decent bar selection along with Hip hop music (Korean and US) bumpin... What's funny is that the music at times seems to go along with videos, but then you realize it's not... but looks good.   Definitely a spot to return too for late night eats with friends when looking to keep it casual!",

My all time favorite is their Korean Fried Chicken served with two different dips. I can never get enough! . This restaurant/bar has ALWAYS been clean and welcoming. The dining area, the bathroom, the entrance, I have never seen anything \"filthy.\" The servers always clean the tables right away as soon as a customer leaves, getting ready for the next customer.  . Also, the servers are always courteous and welcome you with a smile!!  . Food arrives fairly quick, depending if its busy or not!  . They have a variety of soju flavors and cocktails.

    "text": "My best friend and I decided to go to this place because we were desperate to try some korean fried chicken in Arizona, and there were no regrets! The vibe of this place was really fun (just like us)- we walked in around 5pm on a Sunday, so we didn't experience the chaos that probably happened Saturday night. The kind waiter took us to a booth, and there was only one other group of people at another table (for now).   I can't NOT mention the karaoke part of this experience. You get 'free' 30 minute karaoke sessions by spending at least $10 per person on food and/or alcohol. Since there were 4 of us, we needed to spend $40 (wow quick math) before being able to sing our little hearts out. We ordered our desired boneless fried chicken and some takoyaki while the adults (not my best friend and I) drank some beer. I would have preferred the chicken to be crunchier, but it was still juicy and good! While I am not a fan of mayo, the takoyaki was yummy and burned my tongue a bit (a tasty burn).   By then, more people had arrived so we decided to do some karaoke. Super fun! They have multiple tv screens around the big main room, and the lyrics show up on one of the screens after you choose a song from the giant book. The only sad part was that we couldn't sing any of our favorite kpop tunes because all the titles were in Korean and we can't read :/.   Overall, super entertaining experience (wish you could see the video of us singing Breaking Free in a public space). Now that we're 21, we'll definitely go again and have an even better time ;)",

Ive had better Korean food somewhere. BUT, i like this place a lot for a group hangout, they open late until 2AM on Sat. Parking was easy - just wish they provided more restrooms so I didnt have to wait in line that night. Overall, always a fun time and will def come back!",

As we entered it looked like a cafe with decent chairs and a sit out. Since we had a huge group we were split coz the place is small for large groups. The service is pretty quick and the menu is vast.  We ordered watermelon soju and green apple soju for drinks. Both were delicious. Personally loved green apple soju.   For the food we ordered a lot of varieties. Corn cheese was heaven it was delicious, my most favorite for the night was salt pepper shrimp, the shrimp was so fresh and crispy. The chicken wings are a win be it the red sauce or the soy garlic sauce. They are all delicious. Popcorn chicken isn't a bad idea either. My second alright list is the fire chicken, it is really really spicy and not for the faint heart. The rice cake, fried rice was not up to the mark but not bad either.   Also not to forget they have Karaoke and it was lit. We had a great time singing.   Overall this place you will definitely understand the meaning of food coma. Price is average and highly recommend this place for everyone. I would definitely go again and can't wait to try other things from the menu.",

The first thing you notice when you walk in is the vibe of the place is very bar like and seems like a fun place to hangout, karaoke, and most importantly eat!! I asked the waiter for a recommendation and they said that everyone likes the soy garlic chicken so I went for it. It was one of the best chicken dishes I have ever eaten and the chef (Justin I believe) came out and talked to each of us asking if we enjoyed the food. All in all a very great place to enjoy some Korean food and hangout with your friends!!  & don't worry I think the karaoke has auto tune",

Yes there was crap stuck to the insides of the toilet, yes there was vomit in the sink, and don't forget about the cockroach running across the floor, GROSS!! Don't make excuses about renovations, you can still keep your place clean during your so called renovations. As to your other comment.......Why the heck would I try your food when you can't even keep your place clean!! Really, I don't need to get sick from your filth. I could only imagine what your kitchen looks likes. Instead of taking the time in criticizing a person's truthful review about your establishment, how about you take the time to clean up your filthy bar!!  How does this bar have 4 stars.....wtf! People must be drunk off their azz before walking into this place! This bar has to be one of the most filthiest disgusting bars I have ever walked into. I used the restroom as soon as we walked in so I didn't pay much attention til I got to the bathroom. Holy crap, clean your filthy place up you slobs! Toilet was gross, vomit in the sink, floors were dirty and very sticky. I quickly walked out of the bathroom and told my husband I'm not eating at this filthy joint as a freaking cockroach was running across the floor by the table we were at. Really, where's the health inspector!!!!!!",

Especially loved the fried chicken with green onions (padak) - light batter, fried to perfect crisp, fresh green onions on top and two kinds of sauce. The sauces were amazing. Tteokboki was chewy with thick sauce and just the right amount of spice.  Servers were friendly and the place was clean. Would recommend for a fun night out with friends or Korean food especially Korean fried chicken!",

I think maybe keeping the bulgogi a bit bigger instead of chopping it up so small(bacon bits) and adding a bit more so that they are actually bulgogi  fries.   Flavor was good I think ratios are a bit off!   I'd def try them again",

Everything that I order here hits the spot (except the pupae larvae soup... but come on' even the waiter was honest and weirded out that we ordered it! LOL. That dish is for you if you decide you want to be adventurous!) Aside from that, here's a couple of things that they have that won't disappoint! - Must try # 1 is their boneless korean fried chicken. Their sauce is AMAZING!!! The soy garlic chicken is great too. - The takoyaki won't disappoint either! It's my first time trying it at drunken tiger, and I've had some at other places afterwards, and I must say that theirs is one of the best! - Omnomnomnom the Kimchi fried rice. Feels like I'm in heaven when I took my first bite! It comes in a huge plate so it's definitely shareable! - Their corn cheese is sooo addicting. I know that it's just corn.. and cheese... but I don't know what they do with it that I usually order two plates of that to make sure everyone in my party tries it.  - The bulgogi fries and bulgogi nachos is also a hit among my friends! Definitely a must try if you are craving some fries (waaay better than the animal style fries from In N Out). - Lastly, if you're drinking and chilling with friends, make sure to try the Watermelon Soju. At least do it for the gram!",

The spicy squid was a bit spicy but the flavor was good; mostly cabbages, carrots, and mushrooms though. The squid was sparse.

    "text": "THE WORST COSTUMER SERVICE! Came in with my boyfriend (who tends to be a bit indecisive) and ordered. He chose to get something else a minute after ordering, and went up to the server to place a different order. Ten minutes later, the server told us we HAD to pay for the first order even though we didn't want it and even after we changed the order a mere minute after our initial order. My poor boyfriend still paid for it, not wanting to cause any disagreement in the restaurant. At any other restaurant, a changed order would be accepted, considering there are so many indecisive people in this world. Just disappointed. The food was good, still. This experience just ruined the whole place for us, though.",

The owner chef has done amazing with this authentic street style Korean food. All the food came out fresh and hot, flavorful and satisfying! Every dish is unique in its own right! We started off with the fried octopus, and chicken gizzards which was amazing! We then had the kimchi fried rice, shredded beef and pineapple fried rice! Finished with fresh watermelon! Make sure you try the bar, they have a full Korean bar nothing seen in AZ! Food is so good it is meant to be eaten while getting drunk!",

    "text": "Mozzarella fries, Parmesan garlic and Korean fire chicken wings was the decision we made tonight.  The wings were different than my typical choices at other restaurants but very good in a different way.  The mozzarella fries were a switch for me and I enjoyed them.  We live right down the street and always notice the packed house in the evenings, but never have stopped in.  Tonight we did, and was overall pleasantly surprised.  This was a Wednesday night around 6:00pm and place was not crowded at all.  We were immediately greeted by some friendly staff and given our pick of seating.  I like to sit by TV's with good viewing position so this is exactly what we did.  The TV's caught my attention for the music videos from Korea playing.  The videos didn't match the music coming from the speakers which made it funnier to me.  I thought MTV got sexually suggestive over the years, but these Koreans made me blush.  I have no idea what they were singing about, but by the body movements I had a good idea.  I think the \"Gangnam Style\" singer PSY dominated most of the videos.  This guy cracks me up and he can dance better than MC Hammer.  My wife kindly inquired about the karaoke we've read so much about and I believe the waitress was going to set up and give us a play list to choose from if we were interested in.  I kindly told my wife and waitress no thanks, I only sing to packed houses.  So yes, we will be coming back on a late weekend night so I can sing an ass of myself.  Overall the entire staff was friendly, place is not big at all and atmosphere was mellow while we ate.  The menu is pretty basic and I left thinking what a great place to come cure a hangover with all the fried food.  We will be frequenting more often, especially on weekend nights.",

I do wish there was more meat in the fries, however. The drinks are fantastic. We ordered a Beer Bomb (Korean Beer and Soju) and one was plenty (and it was only $8.50!).

Before I start on the food review...drink that water....I drank so much because it was delicious!   Now back to the food....it did not disappoint.  The corn cheese was the best I've had, I have tried it at other places and this one wins out because it was not super greasy and the flavors were balanced.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and the red sauce it was served with, just took it to the next level.  I just wish they tossed the chicken in it, instead of serving it on the side. Now the pork belly bao...nothing bad can be said...perfectly balanced flavors and the sweet complimented the pickeled veggies. Don't forget to check out the board before you order.",

    "text": "TLDR: 5/5 stars, best assortment of soju & best Korean anju (drunk food) in AZ + great service at great prices = win. Was my first time there, and definitely won't be my last. Go here!  Full Review: Closest thing to Gaam (well known LA/ktown soju bar) in AZ. They even have all of the flavored bottled soju (peach, grapefruit, pineapple, blueberry, etc) which was surprising because I personally hadn't been able to find them anywhere outside of Korea so props to this little gem of a place for carrying all of them in AZ.   Food also went above and beyond my expectations,  friends and I shared the ddukboki and fried chicken to go with our drinks which was probably the best I've had in AZ imo. Staff was also very friendly, attentive, and made the entire experience even better (shoutout to Jasmine who took very good care of us). Oh and to mention everything was verryyy reasonably priced and well worth it.   Great place to meet up with friends for casual drinks, pregame before hitting up Mill or Scottsdale (conveniently located right off the freeway) or a Tinder date spot ;D The only thing I would say I wish there were more of is more cute Asian chicks to interact/socialize with, but that's not to blame Drunken Tiger for :P",

And he was very helpful explaining the menu and going over different options for us we ended up ordering the two appetizers and two dinners that I posted pictures off and they were all delicious.   I think I like the spicy pork better than the chicken but my husband liked the chicken better than the pork that he ordered. so for what it's worth we had a great dinner.  Again I think it's so clever to take something like rice cakes deep fry it, then pan saute it with hot sauce and have it coming out like something that looks like chicken but it's not chicken and it was still super Good.  We will definitely come back to this place!",

The takoyaki was really good too and crispy on the outside and boiling hot in the inside -just how it should be-  the waitress was so nice and accommodating for us. My friend really liked spice in his dish so we asked it to be extra spicy for him haha. The reason I give it 4/5 stars is because of the price. The drinks during happy hour are a good price. The salad I got was on the steeper side. Maybe because of the type of meat? Anywho this place is pretty good though, I suggest trying it.",

    "text": "I was expecting this to be a restaurant/bar, but I was wrong. This is certainly a hi hop bar with the food being a distant second. Evidenced by the loud, conversation limiting, music and limited menu items that could be considered entrees.   Most of the menu is fried, bar style, food and poorly fried at that.  The mozzarella sticks were hardly heated through and the cheesy was not gooey or stringy.  The batter was interesting, similar to what I like on onion rings, not sure how I feel about it on cheese.  They serve it with...ketchup. #nowords   Then I ordered the chicken wings, Korean red spicy(??).  Things did not improve. The wings are heavily breaded (-1). The frying method allows oil to soak into the breading (-1). The sauce was ok, but not spicy at all (-1, had a single chili pepper on it). Seemed sweet.    The sweet and sour chicken was sweet. Maybe the warm pickles are the sour? Not sure, not the biggest pickle fan and certainly not warm ones.   Maybe alcohol washes down the grease and oil? I don't know, I don't drink.   Service was relatively inattentive. Stood waiting to be seated (empty tables everywhere) for a good 5 min before a customer notified staff we were there. Table service was mediocre, but it took almost 10min for them to notice we were done eating. In fairness to them, I ate 2 of my wings, so we were done unexpectedly quick.  It would take an act of god for me to return.",

Manager comes over and sees all bones and says he will take the galbi off our bill.   When the bill comes, galbi is still on there. We ask the waiter what's going on and he says the manager changed his mind and will not be removing the galbi from our bill. No explanation was given and the manager wouldn't even come out to speak with us.   Very disrespectful. Lied to us. Paid $20 for bones.

Came in with a party of six and they charge 18% gratuity  for 5 or more. Which is normal, however if you're gonna automatically  make me tip then at least have better service. Waited awhile before having to ask a server to grab our drink orders and and then proceeded to wait even longer to receive them and order. I understand if you're busy that service would be a little bit slower but there were only 3-4 tables in a room with about 3 servers. Throughout the night not once did our server come to check on us and  everytime we needed anything we had to keep calling for service or chase a waiter. Actually I take it back they checked on us once when they were doing last call. For a second I thought maybe it's how it is here. That they just serve when they're requested, but I've been a here before on a few occasions and the other servers I've had before at least checked a few times to see if our food/drinks were good. The whole night I saw the waitresses sitting behind the bar waiting for their shift to end. However everything else about the place is cool, the music and atmosphere is great for hanging out with friends and drinking.",
