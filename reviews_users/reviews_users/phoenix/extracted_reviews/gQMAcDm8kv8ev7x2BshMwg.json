It's definitely a meal that needs to be shared with at least 1 other person.  Their pho and rice dishes are also delicious.  I haven't had a bad meal here yet.  Their service is not that great, but considering it's a hole in the wall Vietnamese restaurant, you can't expect 5 star service.  That's just how it is.  The restaurant is also quite large but come on a weekend for lunch or for dinner any night of the week, you'll probably expect a wait - but not a long one.",

    "text": "Having moved office to the Central Ave Corridor vicinity, I've been checking out some new restaurants in the area. I was delighted to know that 43rd Express, my previous favourite Phoenix Vietnamese place, was just a few miles down the road. However, a workmate told me about Pho Thanh and took me there for a meal. And it's now become my favourite V diner.  I'd read a number of reviews on Yelp indicating that this place is one of those hole-in-the-wall gems, and to tell the truth it's not much to look at from the outside, just a dodgy door and blacked out windows in a nondescript brick building. But you kinda get a bit of a shock when you walk in, because it's WAY bigger on the inside than you'd have guessed standing in the carpark. Seedyish, and very popular. I saw all sorts of people inside, not just Asians. That's always a good sign. Sat down and got my usual - pho dac biet, xe lua. Delivered quick and piping hot. Gigantic bowl. Tasted fantastic, although pretty light on the tendon chunks, which are my absolute favourite bits in the soup. I also got a fresh coconut and had a joyous time draining it then scraping out the soft flesh with a long-handled spoon, feeling at times like a monkey with a damn cookie jar.   They accept credit cards, which is awesome - 43rd Express does not, and since Pho Thanh essentially serves more pho in their bowl with the same quality I don't think I'll be returning to 43rd anytime soon; I'm also not keen on having to use an ATM first every time I want to eat there. Get a credit card processing system in place, sheesh.  Four stars. Lots of room inside, busy at lunchtime, good amount of chow, great taste, other Yelpers really like it (we're a discerning bunch, right?) and not too far from work. Oh, and the credit card thing. I don't mind the fact that they've got these long tables where you could potentially be elbow-to-elbow with a stranger, either. Just an overall decent place to fill up at, with or without a crowd of workmates.",

We eat here several times a month and the entire family just can't get enough of the pho, even my extremely picky children.  That being said the shaken beef is a lovely sizzling platter of beef and onions with a nice salad and the broken rice is a fun adventure too. The spring rolls leave a bit to be desired but they're not bad.   The only warning I'd give is don't expect amazingly friendly customer service.  The goal here is to get people in and get them food.  Don't drag your feet on placing your order or it might be a while till they come back.  However, once your order has been placed expect your food to be out in short order.    Overall I'd definitely say it's worth the trip for yummy food at a great price!",

I actually just observed the many bowls and happy guests consuming the large bowls of noodles and broth, and instead partook in the vermecelli dish with pickled vegetables, grilled smokey pork, salad, peanuts and fish sauce to toss all together. It is one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes, and Pho Thanh does it well.  I got it with a refreshing coconut that was perfectly ripe and a great accompaniment to my lunch.   Prices are super reasonable/low compared to the Pho restaurant I have access to in Tucson, AZ. So even if you don't have deep pockets, you can come and enjoy a delicious bowl of Vietnamese food that won't break the bank.  Slurp up!",

My sons were scared and so was I. Found out that the people that just left, did not leave any tips.  The food was not that good.

My quest for my Vietnamese medicine lead me to Pho Thanh and I was struck mostly by its mediocrity.  The soup certainly wasn't terrible, but it lacked that certain quality that elevates Pho above mere food into the realm of the sublime.  The broth was decent but not spectacular, the noodles were good and the meat was alright but the vegetable accompaniments were sadly disappointing.  The herbs were old and wilted and I got a meager ration of both herbs and Bean Sprouts.  I did feel better after my soup, but I left feeling like I did not fully satisfy my Pho craving.",

Instead, one of the servers yells across the room and points to a numbered table where you are to go sit. I wanted a Go container for the remainder of my soup.

While Pho Tang may not seem like much from the outside, a quick look inside is a testament to the quality of their soup. I can't recall a time that the restaurant wasn't bustling with happy customers, anr from inside you can see the areas of the store which used to be adjacent businesses, but the restaurant was able to expand to serve mire people. The soup itself is hard to beat. A large bowl of pho is less than $7, and comes with a tray of vegetables to add to your liking. Two spring Erika is around $2, so for $10 I always leave completely full and satisfied. The broth and meat included in the soup are both great on their own, and the variety of fresh vegetables complement it even more so. Best of all, however, is the ability to request an order of pho to go for the same price. One of the best restaurants to visit on a budget, and one I reccomend to everyone in the area to try.",

For appetizer I recommend the Bo nuong la nho (beef wrapped in crispy grape leaves with a side of rice noodles, vegetables, and rice wrap). I also recommend the fried rice, egg rolls, and Banh ceo.  For entree, I recommend pho (of course), won ton noodle soups (great broth every time so far), com tam, bun rieu, and the rice noodles with egg rolls. Those dishes haven't failed me yet.  I recommend coming back here and trying out different items on their menu. They're one of my top picks for pho places in Phoenix.",

The broth is delicious and chili sauce, crushed chili in oil, and Sriracha are well stocked at every table. They are pretty generous with the fresh basil, sprouts, and jalapenos.  I was sold when I saw the menu online. It definitely looked like the real deal Holyfield. Pho with tendon, tripe, brisket, and all of the fixin's? \"Oh yeah. I'm gonna eat that.\"  The service was good enough for dining alone. They pretty much bring you your food and leave you the heck alone to stuff your face in peace. That might not be ideal for a large group, though. The ambiance is very utilitarian, which I like, actually.  The strong flavorful iced coffee with sweetened condensed milk ended my meal perfectly. I think I've found my regular pho spot.",

Being Vietnamese myself, I have pretty high standards for Viet good, but Pho Thanh definitely has my approval.   Although their pho isn't the best compared to others, it's still pretty damn good. The broth is flavorful and full of flavor. The meat is cooked well and the herbs on the side are fresh.   I really like their Bun Bo Hue too. The soup is spicy and you can really get that seafood taste in the soup.   I come here whenever I have a viet food craving and they never fail to satisfy me af Pho Thanh.",

We always start with their spring rolls, as they have a very refreshing mint taste to them, along with a tasty, sweet peanut sauce.   There's a couple of different things that I get whenever I come here. The first is their signature pho - the beef noodle soup with everything in it. Their broth is absolutely tasty, so if there's a meat you don't want to eat, anything mixed into the beef broth will be fantastic.   If you're not into soup, their vermicelli bowls are also a hit! I normally get the one with the grilled pork, ground shrimp, egg rolls, and vegetables, as the variety creates a nice mix of flavors.  This past endeavor to Pho Thanh, I got one of their egg noodle soup dishes with pork, shrimp, and wontons, which is also delicious and has a lighter soup taste to it.  If you want a sweet drink, I would definitely recommend the \"3 colored dessert\", which has mung beans, red beans, green jelly, and coconut milk. Sweet and creamy, and something most people don't think of trying when they think Vietnamese food, but 100% a Vietnamese favorite.   Will continue to be a fan of this place until I die.",

The tofu tasted like it was left frozen for a long time because I could still taste the residue of the tofu being frozen for a long time. The bowl looked so messy like it was toss around before serving. After all, Bun Rieu was not good at all.   Cam Tam Dac Biet: I also got my friend a rice plate and I will say, the rice plate here is pretty good. Give you the right amount of food and rice to satisfied your taste. No complain about their rice plate.   Service: The service here is so HORRIBLE! The waiter gave us our food was so bad. He like literally slid our food and toss the silverware on the table. Gave us our food and did not say anything at all. He even had such a grumpy face like he was not happy with his job. Terrible service here. I absolutely do not like the service here at all.

Only thing that sucks is waiting, however if you go next door and get a drink or ice cream by the time you get done the pho is usually ready and by the counter waiting if you order take out.

The place was busy, which is a good sign. We got seated after a few minutes of waiting at the front door. The food came out rather quickly. Reading through the reviews it sounds like this place is one in a few in Phoenix, which may explain how these ratings skew higher. I think, for a quick Vietnamese craving this place hits the spot. My sister agrees, and she's more familiar with Vietnamese cuisine.",

If you don't take into account the lower service, the value for some actual good, genuine vietnamese food here is hard to beat.   This place really dropped in both quality and quantity since the last time I came here.  They also expanded their restaurant.    It's disappointing, really, since we used to love coming to this place for the huge portions they always gave.  Soup is seriously lacking in flavor, noodle is about 60% of what they used to serve, and now we get a few pieces of meat with at most 1-2 pieces of tripe and tendon.  Price is still as low as ever, but the food quantity reflects it now.",

    "text": "Ate here for the first time this evening. Could see walking in that it was packed so we were worried about a long wait. Luckily we were seated right away due to the steady flow of people going in and out.   Located in a strip mall area with a few other Asian stores and restaurant, this place is definitely a simple, no-frill joint. In an open lit-up room filled with tables and chairs sat very diverse groups of customers. I liked the casual atmosphere but was less impressed with the lack of customer service. They weren't rude by any means, but don't expect any friendly chit-chats or having the server check up on you often.    After our order was taken by our nice waitress, it was a while before we got our food. When the food finally came, I found it amusing when a man solemnly placed a tray with our food on the table and started just handing out the bowls of pho in silence. It made no difference who ordered what so we passed the food around the table. Since we dine out often, the lack of customer interaction was new, but I think common at many Asian restaurants. It's not about the customer service, but the food. And let me tell you- the food was VERY good. Not to mention- CHEAP!   I was not impressed with the Spring rolls (it tasted bland to me) but the pho & broth was very delicious and flavorful. The perfect choice for the cold weather. It's nice to see that they were generous with the meat, unlike a few other restaurants. Everyone enjoyed their food and I'm certain we'll definitely return to try other things on the menu. Throughout our meal, no one checked on us or refilled our water. We had to flag the waitress down and she rectified the situation. To make up for the lack of service, I was glad we weren't given a hard time for splitting the bill. There wasn't a minimum for using your card, unlike a lot of other Vietnamese places. They were very nice about it actually.  Overall, it was a decent experience. The yummy food and price will definitely keep the customers coming! Although it's kind of far from me, I wouldn't mind returning when I'm in the mood for some good Vietnamese food.",

While I don't often stray from my weekly fix, the egg noodle soups and buns bowls with bbq pork are also fantastic menu items, as are the fresh pork and shrimp spring rolls if you aren't into fried apps.   It's also a wonderful take-out option, as they include everything expertly stored for transportation, and a delicious meal at home.   I don't like to think too much about the sanitary problems that may or may not exist with this place because I love it so much. Good news is that they've expanded once again, so the wait at lunch for a table won't be so brutal.",

The staff isn't all that warm or friendly I presume due to a cultural difference they are nice enough.   Don't expect the waiter come by all that often to check on you if at all. would have liked to have seen a couple more drinks. I think the water is for refills as we're getting ready to leave.  The food was amazing traditional Vietnamese, and very well done. I would recommend it for the food, not the atmosphere.  I return serval times since my first visit and will continue to until I find a place with food as good but with less fly's.  FYI when you're done eating you will have to go to the register to pay and if you leave a tip on the table it will be picked up by the guys cleaning the table and not your waiter. I don't know if they pool their tips but just something I observed.",

I ordered a sparkling beverage and they added so much salt it was nauseating, didn't offer to replace it when I told them about it, and still charged me for it.  3. No one came to check on my table after my food was served, and I ended up having to retrieve my own to go boxes. The employees watched me box up my own food....  4. The cashier entered totals off the top of his head on an adding machine and then wrote (and charged me for) a different amount than was shown....   The food is good, but not good enough to make me willingly return here.",

    "text": "After searching a few weeks for the perfect Pho, a friend of my boyfriends told us about this Vietnamese Restaurant. So we planned a double date and we all tried their Pho. Everyone except for me got the Beef Pho but my love for chicken won, as always, and I got the Pho Ga (Chicken Pho) and I must say, I LOVE IT! The broth is not as flavorful and authentic as Viet Kitchen BUT for anyone trying Pho for the first time, I'd say this is the right place. It is so delicious, although I add fresh jalapenos, bean sprouts (they are fresher at Viet Kitchen), Sriracha, and plenty of lime juice. :)  As for the location, well, it is definitely a hole in the wall restaurant that is decent inside. It usually is busy and there is always something going on, whether it is more people walking in, the guy with the kart walking around cleaning tables, or just the restaurant being busy. It's what you would expect from a popular Vietnamese Restaurant. And their Vietnamese Iced Coffee is AMAZING. It is very strong yet sweet. I definitely recommend the Pho Ga and Cafe Sua Da (Iced Coffee).   For now, I have dubbed this place our go to restaurant for our Pho fix and it is worth the drive. Only downfall, the service is a bit slow because they are so busy. My boyfriend and I order as soon as we are seated, because we always get the same thing, to help prevent this issue BUT they are still not consistent enough with refilling waters. So, I recommend bring your own water bottle or you just may have to wait 20 minutes for a refill. Nonetheless, I do enjoy the vibe and food here.",

I got squashed in between a table with people all around me, but that's okay...I settled in quite nicely and my surrounding neighbors proved friendly.  I didn't need a menu...I seldom do when I eat Pho.  I ordered my traditional fare: Pho Tai with Iced Condensed Coffee.    I looked around at the changes.  No more dust caked on the wall, new photos and pictures, and the addition of a new staff.  The place seemed better lit and had a better vibe than any other time when it was Pho Bang.  My food arrived quickly.  The soup bowl was HUGE!  I asked for a fork (yes, I embrace my Caucasian side) to use in combination with the soup spoon.  I added in my Siracha sauce, Hoisen sauce, and the wet spiced red peppers.  Added in touches of lemon, jalapeno, bamboo shoots, and cilantro.  Give it a little stir, and POW.  Upon the first taste I did notice that this was a little bit more oily in comparison to other beef broths from Pho that I have had in the past.  I was disappointed in the additions (or lack there of) of the green onion and white onion.  Side note:  if you are a beef lover, ASK FOR MORE BEEF IN YOUR SOUP.  There was an okay amount provided, but I feel that there could have been more slices.    Aside from that, no complaints!  I couldn't finish my soup (like always) so it proves that the portion was definitely hearty.  The coffee was amazing, and always is, and still to this day is the strongest form of coffee around (aside from Turkish/Arabic black tar coffee).  There was a mixed crowd of people in here, which I was glad to see.  I have been to many Vietnamese restaurants in the past, all alone, and was the only non-Vietnamese person in the restaurant.  All sorts of cultures and ethnicities were present.",

    "text": "My buddy Rodney took me here a few weeks back and I'm just now getting to review it..  I'd had Pho a few times about 10 years ago back in Boston and despite the fact that I'm a HUGE fan of most Asian cuisine -- Vietnamese didn't \"Pho-lly\" do it for me.  Bad pun...good bun!  ;)  Pho Thanh is a delightful little hidden gem of a place, nestled into the end of a skanky strip mall.  There's an amazing Asian grocery on the other side of the plaza which you MUST check out (and walk off your meal).  I tried  a few things with Rodney that day, including #68 Com Tam Tau Hu Dac Biet (broken rice with shrimp cake wrapped in bean curd skin, bbq pork, shredded pork, crab-egg cake and all topped off with a delightful fried egg on top.  It was a lot of food!  I also tried the pho beef noodle soup (#14 pho tai bo vien) with sliced beef & meatballs.  Addictive!!  I went back 2 weeks later with my buddy Steve and got more #14 soup....I'm now officially in love with that soup!  It's a HUGE bowl of broth & vermicelli noodles and comes with a side platter piled high with fresh herbs, citrus and some very piqued pepper slices (beware)!  Contrary to the rest of the plaza, the place is clean, the decor sparsly amusing/sad remnants of the proprietors previous life in Viet Nam, I supppose.  There is a killer poster I'd love to have that looks like it was produced by the either ministry of tourism or ministry of production that shows a woman with 3 brightly colored balls of yarn  (would someone please take a pic of this and post it to Yelp!?!?)  The staff is super nice and comped me a swig of a most amazing fresh pennywort drink.  It glows vibrantly green as it sloshes & swirls within a juice dispenser at the counter.  Tasted fresh (like wheatgrass juice) and left an aromatic effervescence on my tongue for a few moments after swilling it down.  Prices are super reasonable (most items between $4.95-6.95) and  I haven't left hungry yet!  Props to Rodney for pushing my gastronomic envelope and getting me hooked on a new local fave!",

The freshness of all the herbs and veggies, the out of this world level of umptuous savory goodness... Simply put, it's a great place. And super easy on the wallet too. It was, at one time, filled with only Vietnamese people. We would be the only ones in the restaurant of another ethnicity- side note, when going to an 'ethnic' restaurant, its usually a good sign to see people from that region as patrons.   Somehow the secret has escaped and it is quite multicultural now. It's refreshing to see Hispanic, Caucasians, and Vietnamese all rubbing elbows while inhaling a hot bowl of Pho!   I feel as the pictures should speak for themselves...   Here's the info... But don't overrun the place. We don't like going and not having somewhere to sit!  Google recognizes it as:  Pho Bang Restaurant  Ste 14, 1702 West Camelback Road  Phoenix  1 (602) 242-1979   LOVE IT! Very authentic and so amazing.",

    "text": "With all the great reviews this place has been getting, I had to try it out.  This is a small place in a strip mall.  Again, not \"D&G cool\" but \"local cool.\"  The place had a good amount of people, even at around 4 pm.   Although I like pho, I prefer bun bo hue.  So, that is what I ordered.  It was okay.  The broth was a bit watery, lacking in depth of flavor.  But I did get a generous amount of meat, as well herbs an such, as accompaniments, which is always a plus.     My husband had the pho, however.  He ordered the extra large size for a few dollars more.  Although you get more noodles and broth with the extra large size, you do not get more meat.  So, he was a little disappointed.  But, the broth was very flavorful.  More flavorful than the bun bo hue broth.   And he also got a good amount of herbs and such to go with his pho.  If you are in the neighborhood and have a hankering for pho, I would say this is the place to go.  But, as a Tempe resident, I would stick with Kai Hoan for pho or bun bo hue.",

    "text": "Vietnamese tested and approved. This place gets two yellow thumbs up.  I was happy that Pho Bang is finally gone because that place was what Vietnamese food tastes like on its way out. Anyway- so Pho Thanh...  Just got back from it and before I slip into a food coma, I thought I should review it first. Busy busy busy. That's pretty typical for a Sunday crowd. I came here with my real life friends and fellow Yelpers, Cori S. and Tim J., and Tim was pretty convinced that this place was gonna rock his world even before ordering because he didn't see any other white people. It must be good if actual Vietnamese people eat here.  And it was! Despite the fact that it was busy and service was slow, it was understandable. I never go to any Vietnamese place and expect exceptional service. So long as I have this kind of expectation, I'll never be disappointed, right?  Looking at their menu, they seem to have all the typical dishes offered at a Vietnamese place. I didn't see anything that jumped off the page so in a True test of authenticity- I ordered the mainland dish- a Pho Bo Dac Biet. Its usually #1 on most Vietnamese menus but its #11 here. It basically the beef noodle soup with the works, sliced beef, beef brisket, meatballs and tripe.   I waited for my food, sipped on my Vietnamese iced coffee and although it took a while to get to me, it was worth it. The broth was just right and not greasy/fatty like Da Vang's. The beef was fresh and the basil, sprouts and limes were clean.   Even though it took nearly 30 minutes for the food to make its way to me, I finished it in record time. My nose was running and I was sweating from the hot broth and the mass amount of siracha I added to the broth.  I will definitely be back to try out the other dishes. I had my eye on the Bun Bo Hue and Bo Kho, which are various beef soups/stews. I'll update you on those experiences later.",

Slightly off-putting.  Our server was prompt but not super friendly.  I honestly would like to know where people in food service heard it would hurt them to smile on occasion. I'm not going to leave you a Smaller tip for being friendly!  Anyhoo,  Food was all very fast. We ordered spring rolls with shrimp ($2.25). Pretty good served with a sweet-ish brown sauce of sorts that I can't figure out what it was.  We got the Pho with filet and tendon for around $5. Very taste. Lots of green stuff to add. We also ordered the Lemongrass Chicken. Twas very oily and got some pretty firm bits of lemongrass, but a really nice flavor with chiles as well.   They were out of Thai tea :( and Ben ordered a plum drink that was pretty good, however salty (which I think is probably how it's supposed to be, but being a typical American who does NOT put salt in her beverages, it was a little much)  I'd go back.",

If you are a stickler for cleanliness and atmosphere, this is not the place for you.  The food is a completely different story - portions are plentiful and the dishes are well-prepared.  It's like going over to a friend's house for some straight up homecooking.  Spring rolls, summer rolls, Spicy Hue Soup, Pho and Bun with Pork came to under $20 with the tip.  The pho was brimming with meat and noodles, and the heap of greenery to accompany the soup was plentiful - they even had shiso and regular mint, which seems to be a rarity at a lot of pho places these days.  And everything was perfectly delicious.  Lemme tell you, for that price and the quality of the dishes, I can deal with a little rudeness and dinginess.  No problem.",

I know sometimes it arrives a little raw to cook in the broth but this was just not going to do any cooking unless I threw it on the grill or back in the oven . But by the point of it being sitting out for at least an hour I figured the chances of food poisoning were way to high .  It definitely should have been cooked more for pick up !",

    "text": "First off I want to start with this disclaimer: Do not come here looking for service, decor, or ambiance. Unless you are looking for an authentic Asian food court experience.  Most of the lower reviews are probably based on what most people expect from an Americanized location.   Let me start with the Pho. The depth of flavor that was infused in my broth was something I have rarely experienced. Who can beat the cheap price and sheer quantity of meat that if offered in this noodle soup. My only caveat is that the chicken meatballs are par to subpar. But the tendons and brisket are perfect!   Do not expect great spring rolls; they are just OK here.  Do get the fried rice with beef! The first time I had this was a sublime experience. It tasted like the paragon of fried rice that I am always looking for. It had the perfect balanced of soy, oyster sauce, oil, salt, and other aromatics. The second time had a little too much soy sauce but was still very close to my first experience.   I have yet to try other dishes but since the pho and rice are rudimentary, yet difficult to perfect dishes, I am guessing that most of the menu will be pretty good. I will update once I go again!",

I advise you guys to get a regular unless you can really eat then get the \"xe lua\" or large. Service was mediocre, no one seemed happy. Everyone seemed tired, dazed or not motivated. It took our server a while to come to take our order even though the store wasn't busy. I didn't like how big the rice noodles were and the broth could be better. What they lack in flavor they made up in portions though. You really get bang for your buck though. Overall, decent shop; I'd come and dine here if I wanted to save money but also get full on soup.

Definitely will return even it's 20 minutes drive from Paradise Valley. However... I didn't try to be demanding. Just curious.  The noodle soup with sliced beef and tendon was $1.45 more expensive than the one without tendon. The server was impatient when I asked, \" will I get the same amount of slices of beef if I order the one with tendon?\"  She said, \"yeah...\" then rushed to put her menus away.  The fact is....not the same amount of slices for these two soups. Why did I asked? I'm expecting to have much less tendons than beef but my wish didn't come True. Guess my expectations don't usually come True and you ladies know why we should expect nothing from our significant ones....always....",

I was hoping for more flavor from the pork but the shrimp was ok. The rice vermicelli salad was EXCELLENT. I loved the amount of fresh mint. The grilled pig was delicious and the egg rolls chopped on top were tasty too. The fried rice didn't get eaten until several hours ltr when I got the munchies. I'll be honest, I don't recall what is considered \"combination\" but I didnt see any hotdogs so that's a bonus. Overall I liked it. It's a safe bet. I wldnt bother w/ the spring rolls again. I think this will be my place when I'm craving the pork and egg roll vermicelli rice bowl. On a side note, I appreciate how the person who bagged the order incld everything wo me having to ask. Soy, hot sauce, chops, napkin and and a fork. Even my ush place has to be reminded to incl chili garlic sauce so I'm impressed.

Has the fast food kind of feel because of the layout and the cashier at the back of the restaurant. When we walked in a guy the back shouted and asked how many were in our party.  The layout is spacious with big tables for groups in the center and smaller parties or tables for two against the walls.  The bathroom must have been under renovation or something because there were newspapers strewn across the floor. It wasn't the cleanses and right next to all of the cleaning supplies in the back closet.  The people I was with told me that they didn't every use the chopsticks at the table because they had a bad experience finding dirty chopsticks. They always ask to use wooden ones in packaging.   Pricing It is about on par with most other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. Between 8-10 dollars for most items on the menu.  Service: They were fast to take your order and get food out. Didn't bother you.  Food: Broth is flavorful and layered. Meat is well cooked and not tough. The egg noodles I tasted were a tad overcooked but everything was decent.",

I went there couple times to try different food: pho, bun rieu, banh canh, and other soup based food. I am disappointed with the quality of the food and the price. The price is almost the same as the one in bay area (San Jose, ca). The restaurant in SAn jose has bigger portion, better quality, more meats, more veggies in a pho and bun rieu. I can never finish the food. This restaurant is only $2-$3 cheaper and the portion is smaller than in bay area. Also, the meat is only 1 or 2 small slices. the quality is nothing compared to the vietnamese food in SJ.  I feel like the food is geared towards american taste instead of the authentic vietnamese food taste. The soup is bland.  If u can cook vietnamese food, better cook it urself at home. Last time i ordered bun rieu, i only found 2 small piece of shrimps, 2 thin slices of meat, some veggies, and several tomato slices in the soup.",

As for food: the fresh spring rolls (made all day long) are a light + delicious way to start the meal - I miss the old peanut butter dipping sauce... all the V-restaurants changed the recipe to a more \"starchy\" ingredients. Pho is consistently good with their signature light but flavorful broth. When I feel a cold coming, I nourish myself with pho-therapy here! Vermicelli rice noodle with pork + egg rolls is my go-to when I want to change it up a bit - it's really filling!

    "text": "I'm definitely a Big Fan of this place and all the yummy items that they serve. The menu here is very large and the prices are very reasonable. The hardest part may be deciding what to order if you are not familiar with Vietnamese food.  Been waiting a long time to visit this place. Seen a lot of great and happy reviews. Just happened to be in the area and had to check them out.  Both inside and outside are very simple and basic. This could be how they keep the cost down and still deliver great quantity and quality. I was surprised how large the inside eating area was and the large amount of slurping customers enjoying their meals. Nice!  Usually get the Pho with everything and in the largest bowl they serve. Here it is the #11 and it is huge. Decided to try out the Spring Rolls as well. This is always a good test to compare against other similar places.  Both the Pho and the Spring Rolls were good. Really liked the soup and can't wait to come back and try some of their other tasty choices. Got my eyeballs and taste buds set for some spicy Bun Bo Hue next.   Service is friendly and you may need to wave one of them down to get seated. When you are done you simply get up and pay at the register. This is pretty much the normal routine in these type of restaurants.  Bring a hearty appetite and get ready to leave feeling full. I was able to get out of here with a crisp $10 bill and was concerned that I might explode. DYN-O-MITE!  4.5 STARS",

    "text": "This is one of my go-to Vietnamese restaurants in this area. It's located on the corner of an old strip mall with plenty of parking available. Once inside, the decor includes tiled floors, black chairs, and sticky tables. Foot traffic is consistent throughout the day, and the bustling dynamic makes it a group and family friendly place to be.  The Pho Filet Dac Biet ($6.25) came with filet tenderloin, beef slices, beef brisket, tendon, and tripe. The broth came with complexity, with depth of beefy bone marrow and star anise, followed by emerging notes of onions, herbs, spices and a mix of fresh veggies. I always asked for the beef to come rare on the side. These thicker marbled cuts often came with a better chew with fantastic moisture. It's comfort food with a tasty spoon. I recommend it.  I also prefer the Pho Filet ($5.75) that came with slices of filet mignon tenderloin beef on the side, fresh plate of veggies, and heaping bowl of bone marrow soup. The broth has been consistent on every visit, and comparing to other Vietnamese restaurants, the beef slices captured all the elements I'm looking for in a good bowl of pho.   The Pho Filet Tai Gan ($5.95) and Pho Filet Tai Xach ($5.95) were very good options too. They came with a good amount of beef tendon and tripe, respectively. I wished the tendon and tripe could appear in thicker chunks or slices, but these variations of toppings did provide additional elements to the greasy spoon.  Services were friendly, quick, and efficient. It is one of those no frills places where the thrill is in the comfort of the broth without highway robbery. Overall, I still believe the flavors could be more robust with thicker cuts of meat toppings. I'd be interested coming back to try their Bun Bo Hue.",

    "text": "I love when my preconceptions are proved wrong. I have actually heard a lot about this place and I know what Pho is but actually never tried it until yesterday. Walking up to this place, you have the misconception that this place will not be that good because it is on the end of a run down strip mall and you think to yourself if the outside looks likes this how good could it be inside? Much to my amazement, my ignorance turned to bliss.  Upon walking in the inside was much bigger than I thought it was going to to be, it was packed and everything was very clean, a pleasant surprise. I ordered the shrimp spring rolls and the Pho, that consisted of tripe, meatball, and brisket. The spring rolls were divine. Nice crisp, fresh, clean, and aromatic flavors. I could have ate about eight of these things. Upon finishing the spring rolls, I knew it was a sign of good things to come.  Then came the Pho. Realistically, Pho is a soup, and I didn't understand how a soup could be perceived at phenomenal. Once again I was wrong. I tried the broth first, a mouth full of deliciousness. The rice noodles were divine, the meatball I thought was OK though, and the brisket was a little tough, but that is too be expected when it's sitting in hot broth all day. But overall a more than solid bowl of awesomeness, and I was a happy camper. What element I think I loved the most was that the Pho was filling, but you don't feel like you overate. A filling meal that has a very light touch to it, which I enjoy.  The service was a little clumsy, but I can oversee that, since they delivered on the meal which is what were really there for. I'm am going to stick with giving this place a four star rating simply due to the fact that I have never had Pho before yesterday and I don't know whether or not I have had the cream of the crop, or if there is better Pho in the valley. I guess I will have to try more Pho elsewhere, but I will be back to Pho Thanh.",

It is also conveniently located next to a small grocer where we occasionally stop in to get produce or noodles not offered in the big chains.

    "text": "My husband is the obsessive Pho fan so I am constantly subjected to the pleas of Vietnamese take-out. We came here the other day for lunch and there were things I liked and didn't. We ordered the fried spring rolls ($2.50, I think) that were pretty damn good. For lunch I ordered the BBQ pork bahn-mi (sp?) that was $2.25. The bread was just the way I like it, soft on the inside, flaky on the outside. It was stuffed with BBQ pork, cucumber, cilantro, carrots and some other veggies. I snagged some of the leftover sprouts from my husband's Pho and put it in my sandwich. Very good. My beefs? Half of the meat in my sandwich was all fat. I am one of those people that virtually loses my appetite if I chew on something that has fat hanging off the side. My husband, who loves the fat, was shocked at how much of the \"meat\" in my sandwich I was giving him. I had plenty to eat of what was fast becoming a veggie sandwich but still, that was pretty annoying. The last thing I want to do is be picking my food apart in a restaurant. My second beef was that not once did they come back to refill our water. That was a problem since our food was a little spicy. That isn't to say I wouldn't go back. Our bill was $10 for lunch....seriously Pho Thahn? That is damn reasonable and the food is decent enough for me to go back....for take-out.",

The menu was unlike many other Vietnamese place I have been to, huge selection. I started off with the pork and shrimp spring rolls. Ahh man!! While I usually make this just my meal I decided to order a main dish item, knowing the extra would go for a meal the next day. I ordered the house special broken rice dish (#59) I believe. I was amazed at the amount of food when this came out. A fried egg, chopped shrimp wrapped in bean curd, seasoned beef meatball wrapped in a grape leaf, BBQ pork, a slice of a meat loaf, fresh sliced tomatoes, cucumbers and daikon radish, a bowl of broth and a sweet vinegar sauce. All this was individually placed over the broken rice (except broth and vinegar sauce). Being full from the spring rolls, I managed to eat the fried egg and the beef in the grape leaves. WOW. Soo tasty!! And so much left over!! Before tip this was under $10!!!",

    "text": "This is our favorite place to get pho, we come quite often and they've expanded a lot over the last several years. The only slight downside is how busy it is, you sometimes have to share a table with another group but it's never been awkward and you normally don't have to wait. The other slight downside is they normally close for a month for Chinese New Year and we anxiously wait until they are open again. The other thing to know is when you walk in just lift up how many fingers are in your party and they will point you to a table, they don't actually come and seat you. We always get the spring rolls and they have awesome peanut sauce! We also love the pho with sliced beef and sometimes add shrimp. I love that they don't put on veggies for the kids pho and I don't have to remember to ask them not to. I've tried some of their other dishes- salads and rice dishes and they have all been consistently good. Reasonably priced. My family is addicted.",

    "text": "So, I've only been here once thus far, but I'm so glad I came.  First impressions are good.  The focus here is certainly on the food.  Similar to Mi Maxim, the decor is minimal; the restaurant is setup to be functional, more like an eatery than a restaurant.  Which I don't mind _at all_ when the food is good and affordable.  Check and check.  I tried a dish unfamiliar to me: Canh Chua Chay.  It was delicious.  I loved the abundance of veggies.  Add some soy sauce and chili paste...mmmmm!  The spring rolls (vegetarian) where a little dry, but not bad.  Service was all right.  The server was prompt to ask if we were ready to order...like 1-2 minutes prompt.  We needed more time and he was more timely in his return.  We later asked for water and were provided with a big pitcher (a giant, blue, plastic mason jar to be specific).  Afterwards, we really didn't see him.  We did end up getting his attention to find out that we just pay at the counter, using our table number (posted on the edge of the table; 6A for us).  Seeing as this place is only a mile from my front door, I hope to walk over sometime when the asphalt isn't molten anymore and dine again!",

    "text": "In a year of living here, I've been to quite a few Vietnamese restaurants, and this is probably my favorite.  This place is a classic East Asian restaurant in the Chinese style, which means mediocre service, mediocre environment, dumpy location, but a huge menu and very good food.  First of all, don't come here if you insist on hipster ambiance.   Don't come here if you're a germophobe or have OCD. Come here, enjoy the chaos, order a drink, some goi coun rolls, and some type of main course.  Aside from the ubiquitous pho, there are plenty of other noodle options, both wet and dry.  I love the seafood noodle soup, the pho and the wonton soup.  Ok, I love it all!    The vermicelli noodles topped with meats, egg rolls, peanuts, fresh veggies and Vietnamese sweet and sour sauce is awesome, in all its manifestations.  The seafood on fried noodles is delicious too.  If you're into fish, the hot pot catfish is excellent and comes with rice and a side of fresh veggies.  There're also plentiful other seafood offerings including shrimp and squid.  Pork, beef and chicken also feature prominently on the menu, as do more unusual dishes like tamarind soup.  If you've never had Vietnamese food before, it is not altered here to satisfy American palates.  It's cooked for the many Vietnamese who frequent this establishment.  The menu will never bore you,  it's tasty, fresh, extensive, and very affordable.",

The broth is incredible and they give you lots of herbs/limes/onions to put in with your pho. I would recommend taking it to go rather than dining in. It can be very crowded, average service, and not the typical restaurant-y feel to it. AMAZING pho though. Best I have tried in all of greater Phoenix area.",

Pho Thanh was pretty high on my list, so I stopped in for a bowl of pho on a chilly December day and it was wonderful!  The seating situation is a little unclear to me. The signs at the front of the restaurant state that you need to wait to be seated, but as I was waiting for just that, two other parties came in after me, walked past me, sat down at an empty table and were given menus by staff before I even got acknowledged. It was very busy so it didn't especially didn't make sense for parties to seat themselves, but luckily my sister and I didn't have to wait very long.  Thankfully, the food made up for the seating. Whenever I get pho, I normally get the same thing - some type of pho and a Thai iced tea. Both were delicious here. Even my sister, who had never had pho and had Thai iced tea in the past and didn't love it, thoroughly enjoyed everything she had here. The broth is delicious and the protein (beef and brisket) that I had was amazing. A delicious bowl of pho is exactly what I wanted and a delicious bowl of pho is what I got. This really hit the spot! I'll be back for sure!",

We thought the first time this happened it was just a bad day but we returned three more times and had the same experience. Honestly sad about the changes because we use to refer everyone looking for good pho and would go up to two times a week.

You expect them to wait on you but they don't. They'll take your order and deliver your order and if you catch them going around dropping off dishes or picking up dirty dishes that is when you ask for a refill of drink.

The broth is perfect, it's not too sweet or too salty, the meat and accouterment portions are generous. Either myself or my husband, or both of us together, try to eat there at least 2-3 times a month. We go for lunch.",

The environment is nice and good customer service. Unfortunately, being located in the middle of Phoenix it looks like a hole in a wall kind of place. But when coming in this restaurant it's complete opposite! This place has changed so much over the years. It used to be a very old dirty small restaurant with no AC. But they definitely made some major renovations and expanded the store. Milk Run Boba next door is a nice addition to the plaza. The two stores is literally connected with one door. Definitely attracts people to go to both places.  I usually order the Pho Dac Biet which is $7.45 And I just had Goi Cuon (Spring Rolls) which is $2.50. The prices are very affordable. The noodles are very soft and the broth is so good. And the spring rolls is perfectly wrapped and has a good texture. Definitely recommend people to come here!   *Note the picture is Pho Dac Biet without meat. I had to take a picture of hers since I ate my food already No meat because she's vegetarian! But still very good!",

The broth in the pho is delicious and the noodles are soft. What I like about the noodles is that they don't stick together like other pho spots. This place does not disappoint!

They do the pork here more like a pork patty, or meatloaf if you will. In Vietnamese cuisine, there are two different ways to do it, the other being grilled slices of pork. I don't know which I prefer as they are very very different.  You get a large amount of noodles, very fresh vegetables, and a generous portion of meat. The sauce is tasty, and everything seems very high quality. Spring rolls are good, as is the peanut sauce they serve them with. The service could be worse, but not much. It's pretty horrendous. Atmosphere is typical of a Vietnamese restaurant, total dive.",

Always have the spring rolls with peanut sauce for $2.50 for 2 great way to start my meal.  THis week I had the pho with beef, tripe, tendons and more.  AFter adding all the sprouts, basil, peppers and more to the dish along with various hot sauces I dove in to heaven,  Even though I may never get my .water refilled or a visit from the wait staff after the initial order, I could care less.

That's a huge turnoff for me.  I also think it lacked flavor, as I found myself having to continuously add things to it to make it flavorful.  Also, the spring roll was just kind of bleh.

They have such an amazing variety of things to try - I eat at a lot of pho places and I like to have lots of options to keep things fresh and this place does that. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the cleanliness factor. The staff was sneezing into their hands and wiping it on their apron and not washing or sanitizing their hands. Also they keep the chopsticks in a container on the table with the end you are going to put in your mouth face upward so that you have to touch many chopsticks to get yours out. There were other questionable things going on which is why I won't be returning anytime soon.",

    "text": "So tonight I met up with some of my favorite Yelpers, Dallas G., AMber W., and Clifford W. Amber and Clifford are not related. So after having a couple of bites and a drink, Clifford and I were chatting with Mr. Chu about Asian cuisine. This is making me sound like a douche and food douche right now, so be it. Clifford is Chinese, but partakes in all Asian foods. They are going on and on about Korean, Thai, Chinese, and Vietnamese establishments around the valley. Which ones are good and which ones are crap. The white boy asks where Panda Express ranks, and the jukebox stops and I am almost kicked out. Anyway, Johnny suggests Pho Thanh over on 17th Ave and Camelback. So Clifford and I decide the night is young and we're still hungry.   The restaurant is in a strip mall on the North side of Camelback. I'm gonna be honest here, the \"shopping center\" is a bit ghetto and the restaurant a bit hole in the wall-e, but whatevs. We sit down and we were told to order the Mi Bo Kho, essentially Beef Stew for us whites. I got the 73, but Clifford being a little more adventurous goes for the 72, pretty much the same thing, but with tripe and beef tendon. I'm all for trying new things, but I'm glad I didn't. I would have gagged the second either of those things hit my lips. Consistency issues with food is my go to category on Jeopardy.   The food arrives and the portion is really big and smells delicious. Tender chunks of beef, carrots, rice noodles, and a plate of veggies to add. Throw in some bean sprouts, basil, and lime. Awesome! The broth was really good and the meat just fell apart. We ate everything in our bowls and were stuffed. All totaled up was $11!!! Can't beat that.   Again, I am not a connoisseur of Vietnamese food, but this was damn tasty and filling. Brave the ghettoness and give them a shot. Oh, don't expect much conversation from the employees. Witty banter wasn't listed on the menu.",

In fact, I think I might like this place a little better than Da Vang, but I'll rotate between the two since they're both so good.  First off, the portions are gigantic! The Bun bowl could easily serve two and I had tons of leftovers for lunch tomorrow. They use the fat rice noodles instead of the vermicelli, but I think it made the dish a little heartier and certainly easier to eat with chopsticks.  Hubby had the Pho and the broth was amazing! Savory, a little salty, and the spices were perfect. Perfect to warm your bones on a rainy day.  The restaurant was more of a cafe style than family sit down, but exceptionally clean and the service was great.

I'm really proud of myself!  We were originally going to Maxim, but they were closed so we found another place to try Pho.  It was really cold out, and a bowl of piping hot soup just sounded delightful.  We walked in and almost every table was full of Vietnamese couples and families.  There were a few other white people in there, but I took that as a good sign.  They wouldn't eat here if it wasn't good, right?  We found the last empty table and quickly seated ourselves.  Someone walked by and dropped menus off on our table like a ninja and we began reading through the foreign novel.  There were so many things on there, and at least half of them scared the crap out of me!  I stuck with my original intentions and got the Pho with the beef slices along with an order of egg rolls.    My egg rolls came out before the Pho and they were quite delicious.  I have no idea what was in them, but they were full of flavor and meaty goodness.  I gobbled them up pretty quickly.  Then came the Pho.  We got a couple GIANT bowls of steaming soup and a plate of garnish.  Now, keep in mind we had no idea how to really eat this, or what to do with all the stuff.  I just watched everyone else in the restaurant and figured it out that it's all personal preference.  I threw in a handful of bean sprouts, squeezed in some lemon, and squeezed in a spoonful or so of sriracha sauce.  My additions resulted in one delicious bowl of heart warming soup.  I scarfed most of the solid food down and sipped most of what was left of the broth.  Now I understand why everyone talks about Pho!  I love the level of customization and it really is the perfect remedy for whatever may ail you.  I can't wait to get some more!",

    "text": "I have had some flavorful pho in Little Saigon in California but needed to fulfill my pho-craving in Phoenix and ended up at Pho Thanh. The restaurant is like any average Vietnamese style eatery, with simple tables lined with the different sauces, and ample amount of space for tables. This set-up attracts every type of consumer, from families to couples, but you can tell most people are just coming trying to save a buck. We started with the spring rolls. The large portion of greens in comparison to the other ingredients made it hard to taste the other flavors, and it came off as bland. Then the broken rice came, and the fish cakes were seasoned phenomenally on the side and so we eat that quickly. As for the pho, the broth was seasoned well, but the meat was a bit overdone, and the tripe was cooked but didn't seem to be the freshest.  Overall, it had some things going for them, but not enough to make me come back.",

We ordered the beef & broccoli, lemon grass chicken, and pork tendon. There was a sauce I thought was sesame oil and put on my rice, but it wasn't! It was some foul smelling butt sauce! I asked the charming server man what it was he said it was fish sauce? *Beware* aquired taste required. Atmosphere was a little lacking.   So to summarize, food quality 5*, price 5* atmosphere 3*, service 5*  Ill be back ^__^ (stay away from butt sauce)",

The lighting is great and cheery, and the restaurant itself is big and roomy. The staff is meticulous and helpful. I always get the same thing when I get pho, regardless of restaurants, but the expansive menu gave me pause.   I went here with a fellow nerdy friend. We both got spring rolls-him, vegetarian, me shrimp. Oh my goodness. Amazing. The peanut sauce was good (although, shhhh, Pei Wei's sauce is better), and the rolls were crazy fresh. Jose said that his rolls were great, as well.  Jose ordered some fancy curry pho, which he said was good, but remarked that he wished the chicken wasn't still on the bone. I always hope for charbroiled shrimp on my pho, but they only had boiled. I chose that, and it was good. As per the usual with pho, the serving sizes were massive, and I got full pretty quickly. I was surprised that carrots didn't come with the mint and sprouts, but it was still good. Our server was attentive and made sure the water was full. Although, be warned--when you order soda (like my friend did), it's a can of soda, not from a fountain!  All the staff is congenial, the food is great, the prices are extremely reasonable, and the spring rolls are out of this world. Will definitely go back!",

The place was busy and wait staff were hustling about to ensure everyone was seated and served in a timely manner but I think there was some confusion about who was doing what exactly.   We ordered the Pho with sliced beef and an order of the pork and shrimp summer rolls.   My girlfriend had never experienced Vietnamese cuisine prior to this and I was relieved my picky eater actually liked it! There were some young men seated next to us that had these sizzling meat dishes brought to them like fajitas in a Mexican restaurant. It was that moment  when everyone looks up from slurping noodles with chopsticks to see what is coming out of the kitchen. I asked what they ordered and they said it was the shaken beef? Might try it next time?   The place is kept pretty clean with the exception of the bathrooms and I noticed the staff cleans the dining tables with standard Windex and they don't try to hide it.   Sidenote: We paid our bill and on the way out I overheard a woman wave the staff over to her table to point out there was a black hair found in her summer roll.",

Upon first impression, the place was packed (good sign!), very clean and full of employees cleaning off tables. We seated ourselves and someone came to our table right away to take our drink orders..  I was more than thrilled to discover that they had a section in their menu just for vegetarians (no scanning through the whole menu to find veg options)! While everyone else was ordering their pork spring rolls, shrimp spring rolls and pork pho... I went with the Cuon Chay which is the fresh vegetable spring rolls with imitation shredded pork and the Canh Chua Chay which is a sweet & sour tamarind soup. Beautiful presentation and such an impact of flavor! Portions are HUGE. I took more than half of my bowl of soup home! I enjoyed every single bite. My meat eating friends enjoyed their dishes as well! First time trying pho for me, (vegan pho at that!) and it was DELICIOUS! They had all kinds of authentic drinks too, which I thought was really neat! Can't wait to try the soy milk they make in house!",

Ok, they fixed it, but only after struggling to find someone else since our server mysteriously vanished.  Then, we tried to order some more drinks. Where did our server go? Oh, I see him. I made eye contact, and got ignored. I made eye contact and waved at several people, still no service. After finally getting a response (from the 4th person) our drinks are ordered. Do they come? No. Does the guy sitting next to me who ordered the same drink after me get his first? Yes.  I then went to the owner, who tried to tell me that there were only 2 servers working. As someone who has been a server and restaurant manager for 10+ years, I notice everything in the restaurant.  Everything. Especially the fact that there were 5 servers, 3 bussers, 2 managers, and when I'm being blatantly ignored and lied to. After talking to the owner and explaining all of this, his response was, \"what do you want me to do about it?\" Really? That's the response? I was appalled. I said you could work on customer service & satisfaction, he did give 2 Thai teas, but with much dissatisfaction and making me feel like an unwanted customer the entire conversation.",

But the winner of this pho was the flavorful broth.  Not only that but you can get a bowl for 5 bucks which is what it should cost. But these days most places have the price hikes up to 9 or 10 dollars. But anyways, this place was truly amazing and all though it's quite a drive from my place in Tempe it's well worth it for the amazing pho.  I'll definitely be coming back to this place in the very near future and would highly recommended it.",

Coming from Southern California, home of Little Saigon, I thought that I probably would have already tried all the best broken rice dishes that vietnamese cuisine had to offer.  But I was definitely wrong.  That's because up until a few months ago, I haven't yet tried the Pho Thanh version!  I ordered the charbroiled pork broken rice plate, expecting the typical slices of grilled pork meat over rice.  When my dish came out, I was a little taken aback.   Instead of the usual, I found two large pieces of what looked a pork meatloaf/sausage hybrid on top of broken rice. Don't get me wrong, the grilled meat looked pretty tasty but I was certain that someone must have made a mistake with my order.  I didn't want to make a fuss about it, especially since it looked pretty good, so I decided to just keep it and try it out.  Seriously, one of the best decisions of my life.  The charbroiled pork loaf thing here is out of this world!  Super tender, full of flavor and grilled to perfection.  The only way I can describe it, is the vietnamese pork equivalent to dduk kalbi in korean cuisine.  Dduk Kalbi is marinated beef short rib meat that is chopped up and molded together somewhat like a hamburger patty.  Super delicious.  I've been pleasantly surprised with my culinary adventures in Arizona, and Pho Thanh is a place that I'll always remember, and will definitely visit when I go back in the future.  They have forever changed broken rice for me!",

    "text": "Some cuisines are hit and miss for me.  Take Indian food for example.  I've had Indian food that runs the gamut from amazing to awful.  Same goes for Vietnamese cuisine.  I've been to valley Vietnamese staples like Rice Paper & Da Vang, as well as spots outside the Phoenix area with decidedly mixed results.  Which partly explains why I probably avoided Pho Thanh as long as I have.  I just wasn't super confident I'd have a good experience here.  But with an empty fridge on Sunday and Pho Thanh still being bookmarked on my Yelp account forever, I got up the nerve to give Pho Thanh a try for lunch.  Set right on the light rail on the northwest corner of 17th Ave and Camelback, Pho Thanh occupies a surprisingly large space in a small Asian strip center.  The restaurant is pretty humble looking both inside and out, but I was almost immediately taken aback by how large the interior was, with seating for upwards of 200 at a time.  The tables are numbered for reasons I'll explain later and the place was super busy, but fortunately the waitress guided me to one of the few available small tables in the corner (Table 4, for the record).  The menu, as the Yelp reviews and photos have accurately depicted, is vast.  With tons of apps, sides, soups, sandwiches, and house specialities to choose from.  Yet with all the choices available, the very first appetizer menu item immediately caught my eye.  The Goi Cuon is a pair of rice paper spring rolls with all kinds of goodies.  Pork, shrimp, lettuce, cilantro, mint, sprouts, and vermicelli noodles.  Served with a nice light peanut sauce on the side.  Admittedly I'm more of a fried roll kind of guy moreso than rice paper, but the interior of the roll was fabulous.  The mint and cilantro elements really tingle your tongue and give it more depth than just the meat and peanut sauce alone.  As for my entree, I went with one of the house specialities.  The Bo Luc Lac is a relatively simple dish in the grand scheme of things.  Meat, white rice, and salad.  But the meat in this case is cubes of filet mignon that are cooked until they're sizzling hot and the meat comes out to your table still sizzling and bubbling much as you would see a steak fajita tray fresh off the burner.  The sauce on the meat is a mixture of soy and a couple of other elements I couldn't quite put my finger on.  But the jasmine rice soaked up that sauce superbly and the salad served as a lovely palate cleanser.  Really solid lunch.  Two other aspects that stand out about Pho Thanh are the remarkable efficiency of their staff and of course the prices.  From the moment I stepped in the door, the staff were incredibly quick to get me seated, get me a water, take my order, and brought out both my app and entree in rapid fire succession.  This despite well over 100 other patrons in the restaurant for lunch.  Back to that table numbering thing.  At the end of your meal, they don't bring your check out to you.  Instead you walk up to the register, tell them your table number and pay there on the spot.  As for the prices, yeah they're cheap.  Accessible to virtually anyone of any income level.  I got one of the more expensive entrees at $11, but the overwhelming plurality of the menu is less than $10, with many being less than $5.   Total cost for my app and entree plus tax and tip came to $18.  A great meal with great flavors, great staff, in a humble (but spacious) neighborhood friendly spot.  I'll be back for some Pho and perhaps a Banh Mi sandwich before long.  Vietnamese food remains hit or miss for me, but this CenPho Vietnamese restaurant definitely nails it.",

You could I was overwhelmed by the amount of options they had. I wanted to try everything! They even have desserts too but it's not in the menu but at the register.   Oh! And their prices are great!  For my order, I got beef and meatball pho and pork and shrimp spring roll. The pho was good. The noodles were super soft! However, I just felt that my broth was missing a little bit of something... it could be because I got meatball in it so that had something to do with the flavor. For the price of $6.95 I can't complain tho! The spring roll was so cheap; it was only $2.50 for 2 pieces! I don't know if this is how it is supposed to be but the beef in the spring roll was a bit dry for me. The shrimp however was fine. Overall, I enjoyed the food and the price I paid for. I went on a Sunday night so it was pretty busy, most of the tables were filled up but I didn't need to wait.   The outside of the restaurant is dull looking and the inside is okay. However, the location is pretty nice only because it is literally right next to a boba place!",

Pho Thanh use to be one of those places for me, however the taste and quality of the pho here has declined here from when they first opened. Usually when I come here it's only because I'm invited by a friend, it wouldn't be my first pick. Usually when I come here I get the shaken beef, but on my visit today I went with number #11 because I wanted to give their pho another try. This was a bad choice, the pho broth to me was bland, watered down and did not taste good. Also when my boyfriend asked for chili oil for his pho the waiter told him to get up and get it himself, which I thought was really rude. But here great customer service should not be expected.",

The soup had a perfect balance of spices and ingredients.  The restaurant reminded me of most Pho places I had frequented in Hawaii. Long tables with all the condiments, spoons and chopsticks to serve everyone seated. The staff were really friendly and quick with service. This place is the epitome of \"hole in the wall\".

First off, Pho Thanh has the BEST broth in the valley. There's no contest--I don't know how they do it, but they nail it every time.  Yesterday we started with some spring rolls and cafe sua da. Then, I think I ordered a 114? It had all the usual suspects: tender filet mignon, beef brisket, tripe, tendon, meatballs, plus all your typical add-ins as well. Since there were two of us we got an ample platter with plenty of FRESH jalapenos, sliced lime, bean sprouts, cilantro, basil, and even lemongrass! I am salivating right now remembering this bowl and how GREAT it was. The service was friendly and immediate, and they didn't hound us when we were done (you have to go up to the counter and tell them your table number to pay).  There was plenty of things the other patrons were eating that I need to checkout, primarily the young coconuts everyone was drinking (and eating). I also have never had the pleasure of trying pennywort, and Pho Thanh has it bubbling away on the counter.  I can't recommend Pho Thanh enough if you're into Vietnamese cuisine. If they don't get Best of Phoenix next year, then the people running the New Times are shitheads.",

Order fresh coconut if they have it.  Also, coffee is good.  Combination pho which I order gets the broth right!",

    "text": "This place has all the usual Vietnamese dishes and drinks. I have been here several times and this is as good as it gets. For those that have not tried Vietnamese food I highly recommend starting here. Pho Thanh (translates to soup bar) is the typical Pho restaurant, nothing fancy, but has every thing you need for a great meal.   Come in make eye contact with the person behind the counter, point to the table you want to sit at. If they nod ok, go sit there. If they point to another table, go sit there. This is just the way it is at all Vietnamese restaurants.   Having been a big fan of Pho over the last 20 years or so, I had a need for a Pho fix. I of course went strait to Yelp to find the closest place. Since this was the only place close to the house. The reviews looked good, I figured I would give it a try.  It was just what I was looking for, It is as good as any I have had. Better than a lot of other places. Very consistent with the broth. I have been back repeatedly.   Over the years I have gained a wife and two kids? What  how did that happen? Wow, any way I wanted to introduce them to this. So we took my two year old with us the first time. I kinda knew my wife would like Pho if she just tried it. My two year old I started off on the pork chops on rice. Now that was some good pork chops! When we pull in to the parking lot my daughter now says \"Pork Chops\" and jumps up and down. We now go there as a family and and my two year old also loves the soup dishes. Since the bowls are big bowls we have to share with the kids, there is now way they can finish a bowl that big! The spring rolls are great. If you like coffee you have to try Cafe sua da, a very dark coffee over ice.    So far over the last few years this place has been a great place to go for some good food. Service has been prompt and courteous. and the food has always been great.",

Generous amount of meat, but you know what they say, Pho is all about the broth.  That's what makes it.  Every pho is made from  beef broth even the chicken pho.  And that wouldn't be bad if the broth was flavorful. Da Vang's broth is a 5 out of 5 but I decided to compare.  I had the spicy, salty shrimp with shells on.  They were ok but I didn't realize I would be eating the shrimp's caca in the process.  My guest had beef with snow peas.  It was spiced to his liking but the flavor just wasn't there.  Their prices are incredibly low and that's why I gave them an extra star otherwise it would be a one.  You get what you pay for.  Back to Da Vang for me!!!!!",

    "text": "Super disappointed.  I've eaten at plenty of pho places, mainly in Las Vegas and one in Flagstaff, and they have all been better than this.  \"Why?\" you might ask, and the answer lies within the broth.  To me, what makes a pho place good is the broth.  I always get the beef ball pho, but this time I mixed it up a little and got the sliced beef and meatball pho (I know, I'm a risk taker).  It makes it easy to compare to other places, so I'm not kidding when I say the soup is definitely lacking in taste.  They definitely do not skimp on the meat though (as opposed to many, many pho places) so if that floats your boat, this is your place.  I have to admit, my impression of this place started better off.  My boyfriend and I split the cold cut combo sandwich and I thought it was very good.  Granted, I have not had that many Vietnamese sandwiches, but I could eat this everyday.  I guess until I eat a really great one.  But that was a good experience for me, so now I want to order one of those every time I visit a pho restaurant from now on!  Verdict?  I would not give this place another chance, because the broth is very important to me.  You would like this place if you liked other Vietnamese dishes, or pho with other kinds of broths.",

Service was quick to get seated and order. Beef pho seems to be the house specialty. I got the chicken and a friend got the beef. While it was good, I'd have to say the broth I've gotten at Song Lynn in Avondale was much better. This broth was sort of flat. I found myself adding more jalepenos and even chilis to give it flavor.  The limeaide was a refreshing choice, but wish they'd give refills.   Overall, a decent pho place but not one I'd go out of my way to return to try.  Pho was in the $6-7 range.  The guy pushing the bus cart reminded me of a cafeteria again. Yeah it cleans the tables quicker, but looks so nasty!",

I ordered the pho with rare beef and meatballs, and also the BBQ pork sandwich. All pretty tasty.  All my other friends ordered pho also and by the looks on their faces they seemed satisfied and it seem to hit the spot for the day. I'd love to give this place 5 stars, but couldn't because they looked pretty busy, but it took awhile for us to just get a refill on some water. It wasn't just us though, it looked like everyone only got one glass of water. Other than that, the food here is good and I'll be back.",

    "text": "The 4 stars is for the food and only the food, there is no ambiance nor is the service very welcoming. While there are other Vietnamese restaurants that offer the same authentic dishes with friendlier faces, the 4 stars is for offering a few dishes that you can't find at the other places, and which is why I come here. One of my favorite dishes here is the table grilled beef, you are given a individual grill to cook the beef and all the fixings to make your own spring rolls. At $11 it's a generous portion and can feed two. Another favorite is the sugar cane shrimp - Choa Tom. This is also a \"make your own\" dish, but with lettuce wraps instead of rice paper and lot's of fresh veggies and herbs. While the service is curt it, is also fast, so a great lunch spot if you're looking to be in-and-out. When I first came here I was really uncomfortable by the service, but now that I know what to expect it  hasn't deterred me from returning. If you're looking for authentic Vietnamese and to try some different dishes at a very low cost, I highly recommend Pho Thanh.",

    "text": "This was my first pho experience in Phoenix, and, as you might've guessed by my five-star rating, I wasn't disappointed.  I'll start off with a disclaimer about the location: it's in one of Phoenix's sketchier areas, and I've never not seen a homeless person walking around in the strip mall it's located in. That being said, if you go in the day you should be fine. I can't speak to how ghetto it might get at night.  This isn't one of those Vietnamese places that invests a lot in ambiance. You walk in and usually are greeted by a busy wait staff and plenty of customers. I've never had to wait long for a table though. Compared to places I've been in Tucson, Albuquerque and California, the prices are a steal - a little over $5 for a decent sized bowl of some of the best pho I've ever had. One of the other reviewers praised the broth, and I have to agree - no need to drown it with hoisin and sriracha too much. They don't skimp on garnishings like some of the other places I've been too either. Their spring rolls make an excellent appetizer. If you're not in the mood for pho, feel free to grab one of their banh mi - also decently priced and plenty of bang for your buck.  All in all, a great place, and one that I look forward to returning to.",

    "text": "I consider myself an aPHOcianado and this place is great! The menu is extensive and there is something for everyone who enjoys Asian dining. The place is a ZOO between 1130am and 130pm so if you have a flexible schedule get there off-peak to avoid waiting in line. The place is HUGE in terms of Pho retaurants, but still gets a line. The broth is fine, but I will say that I find it a little weak in flavor. I have had pho that I enjoyed more at other places. Lucky for me I also enjoy countless other dished they do a great job on, so I just get something else. I have had the special spicy Bun soup (minus the pork blood) and it was tasty. I draw the line at beef tendon which I LOVE! Sorry tripe and pork blood, but you will remain on my if-i-were-starving-to-death-on-a-life-raft-desert-island-mountain-top-last-resort-before-eating-another-person list. With all Pho places, be sure to check the hours. They tend to take a weekday off and often close early like before 9pm. This place is closed tuesdays and always closes at 830pm. However, they open at 830am so it's not unlike me to head over for some Vietnamese chow for breakfast! The owners also run the asian market a few doors down which is also huge and sells tons of great asian products and cheap fresh produce, so open your mind away from Safeway and check it out. They have like 150 different brands of soy sauces as well as a million other amazing treats and funky products, so I always have a boo in there after I eat. If ever I want actual Pho soup, I head over to their competition at Da Vang on 19th Ave south of Camelback.. Awesome broth! Is Pho Thanh my new regular spot? Pho Sho'!!",

Since my Vietnamese food loving friend introduced me to Pho Thanh a few weeks ago (thank you!!), I have already enjoyed multiple visits.  It is that good.  They are open early, too (8:30am!) so it is a good choice for a post-hike late breakfast/early lunch.  A typical visit starts off with the #1 spring rolls.  They are huge - rice paper stuffed with shrimp, pork, lettuce, mint and sprouts and (yay!) served with peanut sauce.    Sometimes a Bahn Mi (sandwich) gets thrown into the mix - fresh soft bread and ample portions of warm pork.    On to the Main Event... Pho.  Their take-out menu states on the front \"The Best Beef Noodle Soup In Town\" - believe it.  They are not kidding.  I am a creature of habit, and always have the #113 - beef noodle soup with filet mignon tenderloin beef.  I like to have the raw beef served on the side, so I can \"cook\" it myself in the hot broth.  I am tempted to ask for extra beef the next time I am there.  I don't know how long I can last until I need to go back.",

I felt almost like a cheater, as I always go to Da Vang right across the street, but boy was it worth it.  We ordered two orders each of the spring rolls and of the egg rolls, and we each got a bowl of chicken pho. The items came out in a timely manner, and were served with the correct companions (fresh sprouts, fish sauce, herbs, etc.) The spring rolls and egg rolls were cooked to perfection, and the pho was amazing. It was not too oily, like some other places can make it to be, and it had a good ratio of noodles and broth. My only complaint would be that there wasn't a lot of chicken in it, but it could have just been my individual bowl. Service was attentive, but nothing over my expectations (very similar to that of Da Vang, they take your order, bring you your food, and fill your water, that's about it).   The best part was that our entire meal was only $23. For two people both with their own appetizers and pho, I think that is a slammin' deal if you ask me.. I will definitely be returning.",

The broth tasted like it's been brewing for years- so many layers of flavor. The best part was the price. This place is totally worth the trip from wherever you are in the valley. I wasn't blown away by the peanut nut sauce and the fresh spring roll. I wish that it was wrapped tighter and had a bit more herbs included.  Like most reasonably priced Asian restaurants with great food, service seems to be slow or sometimes nonexistent after meals are ordered. Order everything you want when the server is there and ask for a pitcher of water if you like to drink more than one tall glass. I don't mind doing these things in exchange for amazing food and super reasonable prices- I think it adds to the experience and it's something that I expect from a bustling place like this.",

One of My favorite is stripe and only had 1 stripe in it and they charge $1 more for this .... reason why I said the waiter was rude because he walked away while I was still asking for something. And also I asked for disposable chopsticks and he kept pointing at the chopsticks on the table that wasnt I asked for .... honestly, not worth giving 15%... I used to be a waitress and I worked hard to get tips. Tips are bonus. You dont see any waiter, only when they bring food, they all look pissed, You go upfront to pay, guy sits there waiting for you to talk first without a smile, you get up and get the to go box...etc yea ..... no tips. sorry but not sorry.",

The taste is consistent and always flavorful. I have tried other options on the menu however I am hooked on their Pho. For the price point you can leave full.   This place is the real deal. It's a whole in the wall that caters to large groups or family who want the real deal.  The service is nothing spectacular but it is more of a sit down, order and eat at fast pace. Not a date night place or fancy girls night out. Just a real meal with a home flavorful appeal.   If you want to try something different to drink check out the drink menu. The coffee will keep you up all night long, or drink from a Coconut, maybe some real Chi tea or settle on a can of soda.",

The waiter and waitress dressed like they were in the gym.  The food was terrible.  I happened to order to go.  I went home and opened it.  The fish smell was overwhelming.  It seemed that they didn't go through the process of cleaning correctly.  So the fish smell was very strong.  I ended up throwing the fish and the soup into the trash can.  The cleanliness level of this restaurant is at the level of the street food vendor in the third world country.  I don't recommend this place.    Ni nay bn thu.  n tng u tien.

It's pretty authentic and the place is always crowded. The price is also great for this area. Service however is horrible. I asked them for a Togo container and the waiter next to me just pointed to where they had them stacked. You also have to go pay your bill at the register which is normal for a pho restaurant. If you want a cheap Asian meal this is where you should go and it's mostly self service so you don't really have to tip.",

The funny thing is they come back with what you ask for but I can't see how saying \"okay\" or \"sure\" would hurt them?   And then I don't know if it's because I'm Vietnamese and I have crazy high expectations but holy cow why does this place have such good ratings? Is it because it's cheap? Or did I order the wrong thing?   I ordered bun bo hue because I love that dish and the pictures on yelp looks amazing but definitely regrets. When the waiter placed my soup down he goes \"spicy\" and I'm thinking great, I love spicy but when I tried my soup, all I taste was extreme sweetness... I started adding the hot chili oil on the table and one after another, I ended up adding like 6-7 spoonfuls and it still wasn't spicy. I gave up and ate it the way it was but in total disappointment.   Our bill ended up being 25 dollars for both our food and an appetizer so pricing here is definitely not bad but I would rather pay more for better tasting food.   Definitely would not be back.",

Restaurant was completely full but as people arrived, someone were leaving so there was really no wait.  If you are looking for a fancy Pho / Noodle / Asian food, definitely don't come here, this is no frills, blue collar, minority, hole in the wall, inexpensive.  But I enjoyed this place very much. Order quickly because they bring it out quickly and turn your table, then you go to stand up in line to pay.  They don't bring you a check, you go to the area where the sign says pay here and tell them what table # you were at.  We ordered the following -  #15 Pho Tai name sliced beef and beef brisket - $6.45  #26 Mi Hoanh Thanh Egg Noodles Soup  with pork wontons, shrimp, squid, pork, fish meatballs and a quail egg - $7.45  Bowls are good size and will certainly fill you up. Very good broth filled with lots of meat, shrimp, wonton and pork.  Don't forget to leave some room to go next door to Milk Run.  Will certainly be back!",

The food is good, but don't expect any frills in service. Once they take your order, you probably won't see your server again so tell him everything you need right then (forks, sauces, special requests). Otherwise you have to fight to get his attention because he has a million other things to do. The food runners and bussers don't help you with requests. I learned that when a food runner looked away when I tried to ask him something.   If you're a needy diner, this is not the place for you. You know...\"oh, can I get a fork?\" brings fork \"oh can I have an extra glass of ice?\" brings ice \"can I...\" No. You should do take out.  Fried egg rolls are delish and love a fresh coconut.

    "text": "Food:  Banh Hoi Nem Nuong/Chao Tom: fine vermicelli noodles with grilled pork. This plate came with 2 types of nem nuong which is unique. I liked one more than the other. The round cut nem nuong was sliced thinly. The meat was sweet and delicious. The other one was a longer, thicker cut. The meat was sightly overcooked (just how I like it), but there were big chunks of fat (not how I like it). I was confused when I ordered, I thought you get nem nuong and  chao tom (grilled shrimp paste on a stick of sugarcane) but it's one or the other. The waiter was nice and gave me an order of nem nuong with 1 chao tom to try. I liked the nem nuong better than the chao tom. The chao tom wasn't bad but the nem nuong had more flavor. The dish came with a huge plate of veggies, which is always a plus! 3/5  Service: We were seated immediately. The waiters/servers look gangster (tatted up) but they were all really nice and polite. They were attentive and refilled our water cup twice. The restroom isn't the cleanest, the ladies' room was out of paper towels. 3/5  Final thoughts: I would like to come back and try other dishes. They have a wide variety of authentic Vietnamese food at a decent price",

I had the pho dac biet and my fiance had bun mam. Oh and we ordered the deli sandwich but got something else. Just terrible. The pho I ordered special pho. Not so special. Broth was not at all hardy as beef broth should be. Instead it was quite sweet. You know what that means. Lots of msg. Siracha and lime couldn't save this poor bowl.  The fiance's bun mam was salty as hell. I had as a server to get more lime for her. It was just real bad. She says the only thing right in the soup was the fish was not over cooked. But she found certain things in her bowl that would generally not be in it. Calamari ring...WTF? She added a good amount of chili to compensate the taste. Nope. Total fail. Absolute total fail of an establishment. I'd advise not coming here for pho or any dish.",

If you haven't done so before, broaden your appetizer horizons and get #5, the banh xeo Saigon crepe. Use the large lettuce leaves as wrappers, and assemble little pockets of fresh herbs and crepe filling.  Need comfort food? Their Pho noodle soup is incredible, served with the expected pantheon of fresh herbs and other condiments. Not feeling like soup? Try the lemongrass chicken or beef. Most other Vietnamese restaurants deep fry the meats for this dish, but Pho Thanh serves theirs nicely sauteed in a rich sauce. The vermicelli noodle bowls, Bun, are extraordinary in their vivid flavors, and are perfect light food for those craving a change from heavier Southwest standards.  I've noticed a few reviewers were put off by the service, but I think you have to understand the vibe of the place to appreciate it. Are the servers going to refill your drink without being asked? Probably not. Will they get you absolutely anything you can think of requesting? Definitely. You'll get your food quickly and politely. Speak up if you need anything.  Do yourself a favor. Try Pho for breakfast sometime. There's a reason Pho Thanh opens at 8:30 AM.",

In True Vietnamese service style, there are no frills. Don't come here expecting to be doted upon. Not going to happen. Go here because you want plentiful, cheap, flavorful, authentic Vietnamese food. The spring rolls are the best in the valley by far. I literally have tried 7 different Vietnamese restaurants, and I am starting to lose hope I'll find one close to home! I recommend the steamed chicken pho, spring rolls, and their great coconut water drink. It arrives in a full coconut with the top chopped off, and a straw! Great stuff.

You know you found something wonderful when you're in the car ten minutes after your last bite/slurp and you're still savoring the flavor of what you just ate and thinking about who  you can return there with.  That's what happend to me at Pho Thanh.  I awoke this morning tired, achy, and just plain meh. After sitting in the office on auto-pilot and sending off an e-mail or two, it occurred to me that I needed soup. American chicken noodle? Nah. Menudo or Posole? As much as I love them, not today. I needed something like Pho, Udon or Soba. There's an elixir-like quality to East Asian soups (those that I have had, at least) that you can't get from minestrone, French onion, or Campbell's tomato.  When I walked into Pho Thanh I knew it was the place for me. Nearly every table was full at noon, and just about everyone there had a big bowl of Pho in front of them.  I had the everything Pho (meatballs, beef, tripe, tendon), and it was absolutely fantastic. A big serving of herbs and bean sprouts, chile peppers and limes for squeezing made me a happy man. The broth was not salty, and all of the meats were tender and possessed their own flavors. i hate it when soups taste the same no matter what you're biting into, but this was not the case. Flavors were able to stand on their own, in synergy with the broth and the other flavors, and the serving of noodles was plentiful.  I will return, hopefully with friends, coworkers, and family.  NOTE: Expect to walk in, spot an empty table, sit down, order and be served WITHOUT being spoken to. Smiley customer service is not Pho Thanh's specialty, awesome Pho is.",

I have only tried Bun-Vermicelli #39 (BUN BO XAO --- w/stir fried beef, sprouts, lemongrass, peanuts and fish sauce) , #42 (BUN CHA GIO THIT NUONG --- w/eggrolls, grilled pork, vegetables, peanuts and fish sauce) and The Com Tam-Broken Rice #68 (COM TAM TAU HU KY DAC BIET --- Broken rice w/ shrimp cake wrapped in bean curd skin, bbq pork, shredded pork, egg, crab-egg cake).... all were very good with the #42 being my Favorite so far. The place is a bit risk-K looking from the outside but the inside is nice and clean, well lite with lots of Asian charm with a hint of a mom and pop dinner feel. I have also tasted the soup but not sure which one it was but it was D-lish for sure and they serve it in a huge bowl. Most every time I go there are several Vietnamese families dining there and they seem to favor the Soup. I would recommend to put this on a must try list and check out this great hidden treasure. I moved to this area in March of 2009 and am still learning where the good places to eat are for someone on a budget. This place will cost about the same as fast food but a much better place for food and nutrition. Give it a try and let me know what you think.",

    "text": "First off, I would like to humbly say, I eat Pho monthly, if not weekly.  Whether that be homemade or at a sit down, I slurp it frequently.  Ironically, as the business name might suggest, I actually do not come here for the Pho.  My food instinct tells me the root problem lies in the broth.  Not enough beefy, meaty flavors.  You can throw as much cooked meat into a bowl of Pho but that doesn't make the broth better, in addition to the excess oily content.  There's definitely room to improve!  Aside that, there are plenty of other dishes here that are very satisfying and evidently keeps me coming back.   ** BBQ Pork Banh Mi (Bun Me): If you ever had a Chinese Char Siu Bun, it's basically the same thing but in a baguette with fresh vegetables.  The bun is slightly toasted and served warm.  Definitely, a  winner in my book.  ($2.50)   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg?select=ruAAr86Q1SOeE8ovHHUhRA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMA...</a>  ** Beef Stew with Banh Mi: The stew broth is fantastic! Lots of flavor from the beef!  Just exactly how I would like it! Take a piece of bread, dip, soak in the broth, and eat away! Yum! (Under $6)  ** Bun Bo Hue: Besides Pho, this is typically one of the other go-to soup bowls.  Don't let the redness in the soup or the pork blood scare you, its the reason why its good! Ha, ha! The best part is eating the bone-in pig skin and meat. (Under $6)  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg?select=aHJ6RhEArYbl4194Z6c-Sg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMA...</a>  ** Luc Lac w/ a side of White Rice: French inspired pan seared steak and salad.  The awesome flavors that is fused with the caramelized onions paired with fresh, crisped salad drenched in special, citrus vinaigrette.  Caveat: a tad oily, but it's fine!  When you hear it SIZZLING on a hot, stoned plate is when you know it's good! ($9)  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg?select=dxw6_gLECBo-fOFNvQImng\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMA...</a>  ** Ca Ri Ga (Chicken Curry and Potato): If you like curry, you will most definitely enjoy this.  It's basically a soup bowl of brothy chicken with yellow curry and potato.  Similar to the Beef Stew, you can order it with a Banh Mi (baguette), OR have it with Vermicelli noodles or White Rice.  I would go with a warm, toasted baguette, so you can dip, soak the curry and eat it in small parts. (Under $6)  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg?select=ok5oYmXE3cIQ3vfJl8gRXQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMA...</a>  These are just some of my favorites that I get here, but you can certainly order much more on their extensive menu.  I stick with what I know and like, typically.  The most important element of this place is the pricing! For lunch, its hard to beat!  The service is okay, they always start you off with a cold, ice water with lemon and then take your order after a few minutes of being seated.  Lastly, if you crave desserts, they are refrigerated and visible as you come up to pay for your meal.   If you are lucky enough to work around or twelve minutes away (like I do), I highly recommend getting your Viet fix here.",

This place offers consistent, affordable Vietnamese food in large portions.  Highlights for me include the fresh young coconut, the shrimp spring rolls, and the stir fry noodle dishes.  Although, everyone who I've seen go with the pho seems pretty happy as well.  The atmosphere is nothing special, but the company you go with will hopefully make up for that!  I went with my brother the first time and for the International Supper Club kick-off tonight, so needless to say, I was entertained during both visits.    Service is attentive although I did have to ask for my water to be refilled a couple of times.  They were great with our large group and were fine doing separate bills as well.  Oh, and they can do vegetarian entrees and pho upon request.  Bottom line: Pho Thanh is a pho-nomenal choice for affordable Vietnamese in Pho-enix!",

    "text": "Love this place. I typically order the pho ga or pho tai. Spring rolls are awesome as well! Really I don't think there's anything you could order here and go wrong - the other reviews paint a good picture of the fare. My only real gripe is the \"to go\" (or lack thereof) service. They don't answer their phone / I regularly get a weird message about their mailbox. So ordering ahead is next to impossible. If you're planning on placing a to go order - proceed directly back to the payment counter. I usually just pop a squat in front of the to go shelves they have to the right of the payment counter if I can to wait - they don't really have a process for it. They also just kinda toss the to go orders over there. So be watchful for yours. If that process was a little easier this place would shine even more.",

I mean who doesn't love good meat, cheese and delicious bread....but that is a topic for another post.  I paid a visit to the West side of town for the first meeting of the AZ Yelp Supper Club. I got there a little early, so I seated by the nice gentleman who said, \"You are in the group of 30?\" HA.   I hung out for a little while and worked on my latest blog post...but I knew I had awesome company as soon as I saw CM Lindsey and several Yelpers walk in the door.   The menu has all kinds of good stuff. Pho, Bun, and various noodle dishes. Even Banh Mi! Score! This isn't your typical Pho house. You get it all here. Want chicken dishes? Bam. You got it. Seafood? It's yours.  I ordered the #1 Pho. You know the one. With the Tripe and Tendons. Only the brave should bother. Also, like a smart guy, I ordered the XL bowl since it was my day off. It was way too much. Oh well.  The broth was perfect. Not too oily. Piping hot. Sweat beading down my head. Everyone who ordered Pho on this 105 degree day had sweaty foreheads. The Vietnamese would be proud. Afterall, this is what people eat in the heat in Vietnam. It actually cools you off.   My Pho was so awesome, I nearly forgot to tell you about my appetizer....the #1 spring rolls. So delicious with shrimp and pork. Oh so perfect.   My total tab came out to just under 10 bucks.   Splitting a large check is not a big deal here. The staff is pretty helpful, and my return factor is high.   I live in Old Town Scottsdale. I am willing to drive 30 minutes...just for the Pho.   Yeah. That is happening.",

    "text": "Went here with the hubby last night for the first time with the Yelp International Supper Club. I had a great time meeting some fellow Yelpers and getting to try out a new place. I had seen this restaurant on Check Please! on PBS so it was already on my super-long and always growing \"to try\" bookmark list.   We started with spring rolls which tasted super fresh and delicious. They were the non-fried kind and there is nothing worse than when those get a little old and the rice paper starts to get crunchy instead of chewy. But these were perfect and came with a yummy dipping sauce. Also, there were huge whole shrimps in them instead of chopped or minced as some Asian restaurants use. The hubby got a beef noodle dish and I ordered Pho. Both were very tasty. I liked the fact that they gave you ample amounts of (very fresh) herbs and condiments to add to the soup to your liking. It reminded me of eating menudo at my MIL's house. I was also very happy to see that they included sliced jalapenos on the garnish plate... even though I didn't eat them outright as did some others at the table, I added them to the broth and let them steep a bit and it gave the perfect amount of spice to the pho. The bowl was so huge that I couldn't finish it all but it was really good and left me with a satisfied but not too stuffed feeling.   Since we got there late, I had ordered hurriedly so I was very surprised when I went up to pay and both our meals including tax and tip was still less than $10. Amazing! I seriously can not remember the last time I paid so little for a good meal. I pretty much never come to this part of town but if it was closer to where we live I would definitely make this place part of our regular rotation.  The staff was friendly and accommodating as well.  The only thing they would need for a fifth star is a nicer location/ambiance.",

They first wanted to seat us at a dirty table until I protested but then I guess I threw off their little seating system because we didn't get our order taken until after some people who were seated after us even though we were ready to order before them. Then we only had 1 soup spoon left at our table & it was dirty. When I asked for clean spoons, I was ignored so I took clean spoons from an unused table myself. You now do not get your bill at your table (or at least we didn't this time) and just go up & pay. My mom said the ladies bathroom did not have toilet paper in the stalls or anything to dry your hands with so she was grateful she took extra napkins with her. The pho itself is still good but we will not be returning. Too far for such bad service & they now have panhandlers standing in front of the restaurant bothering you.",

The other two places I went didn't quite have the quality I've experienced at Pho Thanh. The Pho I've ordered here have just been a tad more consistent than the alternatives. I also enjoy the environment slightly better than the others. It seems more welcoming. Plus, I'm used to it now after several trips here.  Pho is also a great meal after a drink or two in a local pub. Always filling and cheap. I took a girl who I work with here and now we've been spending more time together. Coincidence? I think not.

Nothing fancy but it was homey. They were busy tonight with a mixed crowd of people.   On the advice of the reviews here, I ordered egg rolls instead of spring rolls. I went for the house special pho with beef tenderloin and brisket. And based on a tip in the reviews, tried the broken rice plate with fried pork chop and requested they add a fried egg.   The egg rolls were not good. They were very greasy. They come with lettuce and herbs to wrap and a vinegar sauce for dipping. The flavor wasn't bad but again really greasy. Wouldn't order again.   The two entrees came next. I dove into the pho. It had a good rich broth. It tasted like beef and green onion, with hint of ginger and other flavors I couldn't name. The pieces of beef were tender with just a touch of fattiness for extra richness. It came with the usual side plate of additions. I actually just added some lime, bean sprouts, and green herbs. I didn't add any sauces or anything. It was satisfying. It was good, I would order it again, and I'm not a huge lover of pho.   The fried pork chop plate was delicious. It was my favorite of the evening. It was a large pork chop fried until golden brown with a unique spice coating. It was served on white rice with some pickled vegetables. The pork had good flavor already but I really liked it with a dash of sriracha. Based on the pork chop alone, I'd give them 5 stars but the egg rolls were pretty bad. Dripping with oil. But I'm definitely going back again soon. Pho Thanh has won a new fan.",

Countless visits to Pho Bang, and just as many to the newer, larger, cleaner incarnation - Pho Thanh! While my standby has been an order of spring rolls, a bowl of pho and a cafe sua da (sweetened iced coffee), I've been all over the menu. The bun bowls, the specialty plates, all the appetizers, the banh mi (sandwiches). And I have been happy every visit. I've had men bring me here on first, or at least early dates - as a litmus test for their appreciation of ethnic dives. I've met dear friends here for catch-up on life meals. I've come many times with my former neighbor or my roommate(s) - because when the craving hits, it seems to hit everyone at once. When I start to feel a cold coming on, I think pho is a better medicine than chicken noodle soup!  I love this place!",

I prefer the appetizers (Banh Mi, spring rolls, and egg rolls) at Da Vang but the soup, ambiance, and cleanliness is better here. The noodles are slightly more \"al dente\" and the broth is not as greasy as Da Vang. Service is average and waiters seem slightly angry.",

Some of the staff are even old family friends. Their pho is the best. No other way to put it. I also love their rice plates but the main reason for anyone to come here is to experience the soup. Parking can be crowded sometimes because of the market next door. I see some people complaining about the service or that the waiters stare. They've been here forever and they have a system.

Not only is their Pho very good, but their prices are super cheap, service is quick and friendly, and their menu is the most extensive of all the Viet joints I have tried out in the valley.   My go-to orders here included: Pho Tai Nam (beef brisket), an order of their fresh spring rolls, and their Bahn Mi. They also have young, fresh coconut juice and some pretty good vermicelli dishes. I've tried a majority of the menu over the course of 4 years, and you really can't go wrong. Strong, bold flavors, rich broths, and a very authentic feel.   While I have definitely had better (in California), you can have a whole feast for two people can be achieved for under $25...now THAT'S awesome. And for Phoenix...definitely a solid 4 stars.",

    "text": "In Phoenix we all are subject to a number of poor food choices that claim they're \"authentic\", and its anything but. However all is not lost: Behold the great Pho Thanh, the best Vietnamese food in the valley. Lets slurp up a bowl of pho-knowledge in this review on this restaurant!  ~Fud/Drink~ This small, unassuming restaurant off of Camelback has amazing flavors popping out of the kitchen. The Pho is fresh, not made from different canned ingredients. The dishes are out of this world and very much authentic. For a good starter, the spring rolls they make are huge and sumptuous. With mint, shrimp, and pork, my personal favorite is Goi Cuon. As for entrees, by far the best out of my first three visits is #31 on the menu, Mi Xao Don . The freshly cooked veggies along with cooked pork and fresh broth-boiled seafood mix amazingly together atop a bed of crispy egg noodles. If you can stand waiting a few minutes, I suggest crushing the noodles, add a bit of soy sauce/ other sauces, and let the noodles soak it all in. All the dishes are succulent, savory, and the prices for the quantity of food is out of this world. I have left each time with leftovers, the portions are that big. They have over 100 separate dishes, the list is extensive, to say the least. They do not serve alcohol here, however the list of soft drinks and traditional Vietnamese offerings like baby coconut milk or thai tea is......extensive once again.   ~Atmosphere/Service~ This is the reason they lose a star. I am not a big atmosphere person, unless it simply detracts from the experience all-together. There are three separate issues to point out. First, the music and decor in the restaurant....they  are \"interesting\". They have it seemingly on a looped CD with Vietnamese covers of popular American music. I cannot tell a lie, at one point \"She Bangs\" came on... I hadn't heard that in over 5 years, folks. The decor is once again \"interesting\" and detracts from the experience. Instead of adding to the atmosphere and putting up traditional pictures or decor, they have two separate posters of a woman threading a blanket. TWO posters....as if one is not enough. Second, is the bathroom. You can smell it as you walk towards it. They seem to not have a scheduled time to clean up the bathroom each day, its pretty bad. Third, the service is extremely prompt, let me make this abundantly clear.  Faster than I have seen at most food establishments for that matter. But if you were to ask them for recommendations, it may prove to be difficult, as they are in a hurry to service other tables. We do not get many smiles or get asked how we are doing....To be honest, I am sure its a cultural thing. I shrug it off, if you take things like that to heart then you need to check yourself. Overall, these aren't hideous issues, but a star lost is more than fair, in my mind.  ~Extras/Rating~ Overall, the food is outstanding. They get 4 stars for variety of choices, quality/taste of food, price point in comparison to quanitity, and lightning fast service. But honestly, \"She Bangs\"?  If not for those issues, its a 5 star top choice for me. Regardless, this has become my favorite go-to spot locally. I have gone 3 times the past two weeks, and at some point this week and next I shall go again....and I can't wait. Bring on the Pho Thanh, I say!!!  Enjoy!",

It was a perfect pick by Gabi as I was really craving for Vietnamese food that night.  I had ordered the Bun Bi Cha Gio (vermicelli with eggrolls, seasoned shredded pork, vegetables, crushed peanuts and fish sauce).  This is the best noodle dish especially when outside is so hot!   It will definitely cool you off.   I also had the whole young coconut.  The coconut juice and the meat were so fresh.  You might need to have some serious elbow grease to remove the meat inside the coconut.  I would warn the people sitting around in case you hit them.  Sorry to be so critical but I was so excited to have a \"Vietnamese\" restaurant in the 'hood.",

Not in the best of neighborhoods either, but don't let that scare you away. There's an Asian massage parlor next door. Do I know if they give happy endings? No, I don't, but you may want to inquire within after you stuff your gullet with steaming pho. Be prepped to get the fuzz called after you bust a move after your body shampoo.

I ordered the chicken curry dish. It was the most disappointing curry I've ever had (I love curry and was really excited for this). It was thing, watery, and bland. Very little spice or flavors. Only had half a potato and a few onions, and the chicken - oh god the chicken. It was a whole chicken, including skin, which had been chopped up and thrown into the curry. I tried picking off meat from the little bones, but I came up with little edible chicken. About 1/3 way through the dish I had to stop eating because every other bite resulted in little chicken bone fragments. Gross.   My boyfriend got the pho with shrimp and extra veggies. Quite bland as well, and the only veggies that came with it was broccoli. Really? At other Vietnamese restaurants you get tons of different veggies!   We both ordered the Vietnamese iced coffee and it was incredible. But it wasn't good enough to make up for the food. :( I'm always sad to have subpar Vietnamese food.",

I'd like to think those days are far gone but do still occur from time to time, but I digress.....  The fact that my peeps and I still frequent  this place just to enjoy the food as non intoxicated human beings, is a good sign.    + Pre apology to Pho Thanh and all other pho places and all the vietnamese moms, but my mama's pho is the best.  With that being said, this place has pretty decent pho.  I tend to like my broth with a liiiiiitle more fat, as I feel Pho Thanh's broth is more \"lean\", if you will.  But it's still full of the right flavors, none of which over powers the other.  It's pretty consistent and that's KEY.    + Hu Tieu Bo Kho ( Beef Stew with Rice Noodle) - recently, I've taken a liking to this particular dish.  I have been getting it every time I come here, which is every other week.  It's nothing like american  beef stew, which can be thick and heavy in texture.  Bo Kho is more soupy/watery, but its flavor is super rich without being too much, and has a slight sweetness that blends extremely well with all the spices and herbs.  I love to dress my Bo Kho with the sate paste, extra cilantro and bean sprouts, and I request the wide rice noodle instead of the regular ones.  +Com Tam (Broken Rice) - Their rice dishes have a good selection/variety of toppings.  I usually just  get the broken rice with pork chop, and also request an egg over easy on top. Soooo simple but delish.    +Eggrolls - Not out of this world, but probably the best I've had in a vietnamese restaurant.  +Chao Ga (Chicken Rice Porridge ) -  Ever heard of the saying... show me your friends, and i'll tell you who you are?  Well, show me your rice porridge, and i'll tell you if suck.  And Pho Thanh doesn't.  It's comparable to home made rice porridge, with the perfect amount of chicken broth flavor, consistency is not too thick or thin, and its actually RICE porridge, not a bland bowl of water with a few grains of rice floating around.    I've yet to try and explore other menu items but these are the ones that really stand out in my mind right now and just remember that my 5 star review is based off of these alone.  I didn't factor in service and ambiance, because there isn't any.  Don't expect anyone to come by to ask how your food is.  I think they know their food is good.  Don't expect anyone to refill your water unless they aren't busy, and they usually are.",

We always get the #32 Seafood Udon, with a BBQ pork Bahn Mi, and a couple ordered of Egg rolls. Maybe a Summer roll every now and then.

This place is situated in a nondescript strip mall of Asian inspired shops.  I have literally passed it a dozen times and have never noticed it.    it looks like a bingo hall on the inside with these tables with numbers on them.  Fluorescent lights lining the drop ceiling and rectangle folding (-like) tables with 6 or 8 chairs at most of them.  The Pho is relatively inexpensive.  I didn't realize, ordering the oxtail Pho, that I was ordering one of the most expensive things on the menu at $12.  I am one of those weirdos who order Pho for the broth and the beef.  I'm indifferent about the noodles and rarely eat much of them.  The broth here is the best I've had in Phoenix.   This was a warm treat on a chilly rainy day.   The place was packed too.  I was surprised, but then maybe not.  It was a rainy cool day in PHoenix.  Who wants to be out?  Apparently others had the same thoughts as I, let's get Pho!  Return factor: 90%",

From the time they open until the time they close and you'll probably have a few minute wait if you're not here on an off-time (ex: 3pm), but even then, most of the tables will be full. The broth is great, the meat is great, the prices are great... Great meat to noodle to broth ratios (some places have not enough or way too many noodles or not enough meat). The employees rush around pretty tentatively and whenever you're ready to pay, as with many Vietnamese restaurants, you go up with your table number and pay at a counter. Did I mention great prices?   Highly recommended!",

The place is normally packed around lunch time and the parking lot can be a nightmare when it's crowded but the wait is worth it.  While the service is lacking here and it might seem like you are bothering them when you ask for something as simple as more water, but don't let that deter you from coming here.    When it comes to Pho I normally stick to semi plain sliced beef, maybe add meatballs from time to time if i'm feeling dangerous but that's about it.  You can also add extra veggies which makes for quite the filling bowl.    All of the sping rolls are great and the egg rolls never disappoint.  The thai tea also makes for a great companion to a bowl of steaming hot and spicy Pho.",

The broth was flavorful, but I was disappointed to note that the noodles were too chewy and the beef somewhat dry... But the price was fair and the service was relatively quick.  Having come in on a weekend night, I was surprised to see that the restaurant was nearly completely full, given how big the interior already is, generally speaking. I also appreciated that Pho Thanh will give you free hot tea that compliments well with the hot pho soup, as long as you ask! Payment for your meal will be done at the corner, where a long line may await you, as you awkwardly stand around the tables which are occupied by patrons. And also, please try not to get in the way of the waiters bringing hot soup out of the kitchen on your left.  Well in any case, it was an okay experience, considering that I wanted some hot soup on a cold night. Parking was fair enough - If you can't find parking in the front, then there are usually spaces in the back. Do be cautious of loitering vagrants in the back corner though who tend to camp out there next to your parked vehicle...",

The service here isn't particularly great I must say. It's not terrible either. They just crank out orders and plop food on your table. You pay at the front. Very formulaic. Also the ambiance and decor is pretty bland. You definitely come here for the good quality authentic Vietnamese style food. The beef pho here is my go to when I'm suffering from a serious hang over. I definitely recommend it. Also the pork vermicelli bowls are super tasty.",

There was a weird taste so I pulled the rolls apart and found the taste came from the pork. Then there was the pork blood and intestines congee. When cleaned and cooked well, these ingredients should have a fresh taste to them, but unfortunately they had a weird taste instead.  None of the pork items tasted fresh. The congee was really watered down too although served in a large bowl. Finally the cold cut banh mi. It wasn't bad, lots of ham and nice and crispy baguette. Perhaps stick with the pho since that's what they are known for.",

The house chili sauce smells and tastes amazing, and I'd recommend trying it before reaching right for the sriracha.   The broth is rich and thick and fatty, the noodles have a good bite, and the meat is satisfying. What's even more shocking is that this feast was incredibly inexpensive. I've seen people charge more money for broth that isn't this strong, and I'm grateful that a family business this good is still going strong.

The 2 things that I notice recently is the expansion of the restaurant and they have a new addition to the menu, that is called \"bun mang vit\" a specialty from Central Vietnam, which is duck soup in vermicelli and the dipping sauce is ginger based. This dish tastes good away from the typical Pho. They need a bigger parking space, maybe in the back of the building that needs some repaving.",

    "text": "Great food and really cheap.   I've been coming here since 2000 back when I was at ASU, and it's still the top spot for Pho for me in the Valley of the Sun.  Here's one of my latest pig outs as I remember it.  Keep in mind I went with one other person.  3 coconuts (the guy will crack open the top and insert straw & spoon for you) Other places give you coconut juice from the bottle and add coconut meat(?) to it.  *ahem* Da Vang *ahem*  If you've never had fresh coconut before, now is the time.  Natural Gatorade & oh so much better for you.  Plus, you can scrape the meat off the sides with your straw and suck them into your mouth.  Yes, you may use the spoon also, but it's not as fun. :D  2 orders of #11, the obligatory combination Pho. Need I say more?    1 Bahn Mi with combination meats Their Bahn Mi is awesome!  They've changed it up a bit, and for the better!  They used to have thin slices of pickled daikon and carrot, but now they have big sticks of them in the sandwich.  Order one with your Pho.  You can dip the fresh french roll right into the soup and chomp down on the combination of Vietnamese sandwich meats at their finest.    1 order of spring rolls I like how their rolls taste always fresh, not like how they seemed to have been rolled and kept in the fridge.  I think the very high turn over rate they have here helps  1 order of egg rolls.  All that came out to 25 dollars and something cents! I actually misunderstood the cashier and thought he had said forty five, but considering the amount of food we had at the table, I didn't even question it.  But seeing the number total on the register hit me as I was surprised it was so cheap!  I've had their pork chop w/egg rice plates as well, and they're an awesome option for people who do not like the so-called \"smell or scent\" of Pho.    PS:  Vietnamese restaurants usually all close on Tuesdays.   It's pretty smart since it really IS the slowest day for restaurants.",

The amount of cilantro, basil and razorgrass (?) that comes with the Pho really adds to the flavor.    For anyone complaining about service, I think that it is more an issue of expectation - they bring my food within 10 minutes of ordering.  They fill my water glass if they notice it.  It's better to think of this place as being more like \"cafeteria-style\" rather than a sit down restaurant - they're curt, but quick, which they have to be considering how busy they always are.  Also, it's so affordable, I can eat here without feeling like I'm dining out since I don't think I could make such good food for less at home.",

    "text": "Service has to be pretty bad for me to complain and let me tell you that Pho Thanh has some of the worst service. Come here for a bowl of hot pho, not for a local dining experience.  Waiters legitimately do not want to talk at all. A guy came by to take our orders and asked if we were ready, then proceeded to not mutter another word even when he didn't understand what we wanted. He managed to mime out hand signals that let us know to clarify what number or order we wanted. Mind you, the guy speaks English very well. When he returned with our food, we asked him to remove appetizer plates and he literally froze for a second before turning around to walk away without muttering anything at all. Then, when I was standing in line to pay, another waiter decides to take a shortcut between me and the guy in front of me and steps on my shoes without apologizing at all. I was the last person in line at the cashier and there was plenty of space behind me and only a narrow gap in front of me.  Some of the best local restaurants in Phoenix thrive because they offer a great customer experience along with their great food. Pho Thanh fails horribly at offering any customer experience. Each customer is simply another $6 bowl of pho that needs to be moved along promptly. I would've gave them 3 stars if their Pho was good but it was not as good as in the past. The beef felt tough and noodles did not seem fresh. I've had better from them before but I always prefer Da Vang.   For having to put up with shitty staff and get barely above average Pho noodles makes me not want to return here.",

    "text": "So good! Officially my favorite pho place in Arizona.  Looks like a hole-in-the-wall from the outside, but those always end up being the most delicious places. The coconut water came in an actual coconut (that we ate and it was really tasty and fresh) and it was VERY refreshing.  For my pho, I ordered off the menu with the better grade meat and got the one with everything in it and added oxtail.  I tasted the broth before seasoning it and it was everything but bland! You could really taste the flavor of the meats that were cooked in it and if I wasn't so addicted to sriracha, I would've eaten it plain.  I also asked for half noodles (something I always do because I can't finish) and for once, I actually had 70% meat and 30% noodles. Bottom line: this place does not skimp out on meat like most other places do. I had so much meat that I barely finish it, and that is rare for me.  One thing that stood out the most to me and my friend (who ordered the tendon and brisket pho) was the quality if the tendon. It was flavorful and had just the right texture so you know it was fresh and not overcooked to the point where it was mushy.  The only thing I could've done without was the oxtail because it was kind of a pain to eat with so many people around. The place is big with plenty of seating and almost packed so we had to share a long table with another group, so if you're not into that don't come on a weekend afternoon. I'm definitely going to be frequenting this place even though it is 30 minutes from me, and I can't wait try more items off their menu.",

Lots of tables and mostly taken up.  I give them 5 stars for service.  I got my Pho within 5 minutes order.  Very good for such a busy place.  Nice people.",

    "text": "Didn't really expect much because we have pretty good Vietnamese food here in town but we gotta have a pho place for the kids while on vacation so read some reviews and found this place. Yup, not much to see from the front. Did make us hesitate as to how safe it was here. Was planning to go look around at the Asian store next door but by the looks of it, we declined. There's 2 entryways to this restaurant but one is locked so it was odd coming in. But when you go in you can tell it's popular. It was packed but funny thing is and a usual indication of how authentic a place is for us, this place had no Asians sitting and eating. Which made us wonder oh no it's not gonna be good. Another funny note was that they had these 8 seater tables and good thing our family is big because we sat together but the table next to ours, we saw them seat 2 different families right smack next to each other. Suffice to say they weren't comfty with that arrangement lol we wouldn't have been either. This is a usual thing in China but not here lol  Anyways the food. It made up for the oddities and slight not as clean or vibrant restaurant. We didn't expect too much because Asian restaurants aren't usually that clean but this one wasn't that bad. No sticky seats or tables or too gross toilets.   Again sorry, the food. Ok wow. Was impressed. We have great phos in Austin but I liked my pho here at Pho Thanh. The soup base tasted so clean and you can tell it was boiled down from the beef bone for a long time. I liked the chewiness of the noodles too. It was different than pho back home. My kids preferred their pho here but I actually really liked it. My husband loves banh xeo, that pancake stuffed with shrimp and sprouts and it was marvelously done here. Huge n filling. Another surprise was the banh mi. Wow it was good like really good. My son wished he knew and would've just gotten couple of those instead of the pho. My daughter's grilled pork over rice was unique. Not the usual grilled pork you may think but caramelly and crisp. She loved it alot. We got leftovers from her.  Overall it was a yum. Yes cooks got my order a bit wrong adding cilantro n mixing up the phos but all good because food was good n waitress was apologetic. The male waiter or owner was odd n gruff but hey to be expected :)  Anyways, glad we found this place and do recommend. Wish we saved room for their dessert or drinks but headed to Snoh for their ice;)",

    "text": "So I am not sure where to start about this place. Have eaten here once but had a bad experience twice.  There was one night a month ago where I yelped for a pho restaurant near me and came across this place. We were 17 minutes away so we drove over and it was closed with no sign or excuse.  It was a normal business night an hour and half before closing.  I was happy they were closed cause I went to the next place we found on Yelp. DA VANG which is maybe 3 minutes away. We loved Da Vang as the food was so good and authentic as well as cheap. It was a blessing.  I had picked this place only cause it had more reviews. Many which I found said go to Da Vang.  We have gone to their competitor 5 times at least and went on Wednesday when they were closed by accident. Yelp does have them as closed. So, we tried here.  This is bigger and probably a similar menu...it's pho and Vietnamese after all.  I ordered the crispy spring rolls and hubby the summer rolls with pork and shrimp. Neither were great. My crispy ones were soggy and they gave me one piece of lettuce for the 2 rolls. I had regular pho Tai and the meat was rubbery. The noodles were clumped together and they gave such little bean sprouts. My hubby had the phone with filet and I watched him spit out all the fatty meat pieces into his napkin.  No one spoke to us and I don't think they really speak English. We had to walk up to get the check. We won't come back even on Wednesdays when da Vang is closed.",

The broth is super flavorful and the best part is that a huge bowl of pho is under 7 bucks. The pho comes with a dish full of basil, limes, jalapeno, cilantro, and bean sprouts to add to your pho as well. If you want high quality pho for a price you can't beat, stop on by!   The shrimp spring roll here is also very good and they have a yummy peanut sauce to go with it!",

That said, I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Had a meet n greet with a potential business client and he chose the place and rather than disagree or seem picky, I agreed thinking I would just pick at some food. I had the beef and meatball pho and requested the removal of any and all traces of seafood, including any potential cross contaminants. She was nice about it and friendly and assured me it would not include anything other than meat, broth and noodles and any of the various vegetables I included myself. Order came out and was fresh, not greasy and no seafood.   What was far more impressive was the diverse group of patrons it had for a lunch crowd! Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, you name it, they were present and enjoying the food. Great to see Asian foods being appreciated by so many! Service is prompt and friendly and fairly clean and didn't wreak of jasmine bamboo or fish sauce that often can be found at vietnamese and Thai joints.  Will be back if/when im back in AZ and in the area.",

As for food, she rates this place an 8 of 10. For service, granted they were busy, it was just a 6 of 10. If I could have rated them a 3.5, I would have. But between a 3 and a 4, I had to choose 4 because the food was pretty good.   As for parking, the center is small and parking was a premium. We were early birds so we found parking, but as we were leaving, we can see people fighting for spots. Prepare your during popular dining hours.",

    "text": "I am a self proclaimed pho aficionado, have tried too many pho joints over the years. . So I am a hard reviewer.  As soon as you pull up there is a vietnamese grocery store, beauty salon, and fast food takeout, also a guy in a hoodie at the corner asking for food.  We walk in and the place it pretty busy, good sign, greeted right away and pointed to our seat for two. Looking at the menu, prices are very reasonable and we decided on the number 3, 15, and 31 with two sprites at only 99 cents our final total was only $23.  Service was lightning fast, and I was very  impressed up to this point in fact my husband and I even talked about making this our new spot. Within 5 minutes our order started coming out; First up the #3 eggrolls - good, not fresh but above average. Then it all went downhill.. Second was #15 beef and brisket pho (which i only ordered because they don't have well done brisket) broth was good, again, above average! But then we really started noticing the meat and I kept needing to spit out the meat from my mouth due to the chewy-ness, and after the initial 'too-hungry-to-notice' what we were eating phase, we REALLY noticed the meat was YUCKY. Yellow, nerves, white, and almost going to expire meat. So we stopped half way done with our meal because there was no way we could finish this without self inducing vomitt.  Then #31 'egg nest' which is one of my favorite meals ever, WHEN DONE RIGHT. There was no denying the egg noodles used here were stale even after they deep fried them. Very low quality of meats and veggies were used here again. The sauce was OK but not the thickness or consistency we enjoy and love.  Overall we were very sad and let down by this place, we had high expectations given all the yelp reviews but maybe they use to use better quality ingregients? Whatever the case we won't be going back.  Serving sizes were okay, but these yelpers believe in QUALITY over quantity.",

And I've had my fair share of over priced noodles and broth that simply wasn't pho at all. This was actually my first spot getting pho and I've tried many other places afterwards but this is definitely my favorite. Their broth is very flavorful. I don't even have to put many seasonings on over it besides my chili sauce.   They are always busy here and they have recently remodeled and added more space. I went last week and seen that they are working on expanding the restaurant even bigger. There was a long line but they always do their best to get you in. There is very little communication with the servers so you pretty much have to know what you want and that's about it. The servers never really come back after they drop off your food and that's if they even drop it off because it's usually always the food runner.   No one ever seems to mind their service unlike most restaurants where you would expect more of a communication with your server. I even heard a couple say they were told to stop by Pho Thanh from a \"foodie\" from NY and that the guy always knows great food.   This place is definitely good pho!",

Now I'm going through my water quickly because it's hot as hell in there. It feels like no ac. And they serve hot broth. Not once do they come to our table to fill water like they did with other tables. Not once did they come back except to drop off food. I'm torn about going back but honestly I don't know because service was atrocious and it actually felt cooler outside...in 111 degrees.  I almost forgot to mention. Table next to us had a small dog that they put on the chair and fed. Not a service animal. And girl that worked in kitchen came out to pet it, while wearing the damn gloves she used to handle food. Come to think of it I won't be back.",

However I did notice others walking out because they still haven't got the menu or water.  The line to pay your bill was long as always, took a good 10 minutes to pay for the meal.  The parking still sucks over here, spare the headaches and park across the street and walk over.   Coworker ordered the pho with everything in it, and I got the Pork Blood Congee.  My meal was quite flavourful, and the pho was reported to be excellent.  Pretty decent food here.   Didn't get a chance to use the loo, it has been occupied the entire time by someone.

    "text": "I've visited Pho Thanh several times to pick up a takeout order on Saturday before noon. Even around 11:30, there were quite a few people, and the parking lot was almost full. For my order, I got the #11 - rare beef pho. This is pretty much the ruler I use to measure all pho restaurants, since it's simple and so difficult to do well.   Pros: SUCH good pho. There was a decent amount of meat, a generous portion of chewy noodles, and fresh add-ons (bean sprouts, mint/basil, and jalapenos). Their broth is meaty in the best way, more robust than many other pho broths from places in the Valley. Get the XL size (+$1.75) if you're like me and you want two servings - one for today and one for tomorrow. Pricing is very reasonable, so treat yourself! Also, takeout orders are very well packaged (mine fell over several times and not a drop spilled).   Cons: Parking is very limited because the restaurant is located in a strip mall. You might need to find parking on a side street. Also note that service is focused on efficiency, not lingering. This is awesome if you're picking up a To-Go order, but some people might be a little turned off because it isn't personal. For me, the pho more than makes up for it!",

I was in withdrawal, y'feel?  I then had the audacity to ask \"are you going to give me enough rice w/ these 2 entrees?\" The waiter looked at me, I swore he arched an eyebrow, and said he'd take care of it. Y'all - he didn't bring me a chen of rice. He brought me a whole damn bowl of rice. It was as big as my bowl of canh chua. I was in Vietnamese heaven. The canh chua tastes like it was cooked straight from my mom's kitchen at home. The rice was a little dry, but who cares when you have a huge bowl of canh chua & ca kho waiting to be gobbled up?? The. Food. Was. Good.  Thank you for existing & representing.",

I ordered the beef pho and it was so flavorful I barely added anything to it aside from some herbs and sambal. It was enough for 2 meals and I brought a large portion home :)   I also ordered the egg rolls which were delightfully crispy and flavorful, especially when wrapped with lettuce and mint and dipped in the sweet and tangy fish sauce.   I got an order of lemongrass beef (#99) to go for my boyfriend and he really enjoyed it. I got to snag a bite and really liked the lemongrass flavor but thought it could have been a bit better executed.   The service in the restaurant is prompt but not entirely as friendly or hospitable as I would like, but that wouldn't keep me from coming back. It would just be nice.   The prices are super reasonable. If I'm in the area again, I need more of those egg rolls!",

Asked the cashier if they make the bread- apparently not- but he didn't know where he got it. Egg rolls were good and came in an order of 2. Good for a party of 1 but if you go with your family will likely need to order multiple orders.  Fresh veggies and well seasoned meat. I'll be back to try their pho. They open early but are closed on Fridays and Tuesday's.   I've been recently obsessed with Bun Bo Hue. This place has the best I've tried so far in PHX. Broth is mildly spicy with good lemongrass flavor. Nice mix of pork and beef. I ask for no pork blood as I'm not into it and they kindly oblige. I've also had the egg rolls and Pho here and both are good as well. This is my go to place when I'm in the area.",

I usually order the pho dac biet extra large version because it comes with a wide variety of meat. A lot of places don't give you very much noodles and meat but pho thanh gives you a substantial amount in my opinon, i just like even more food   It's also nice that this restaurant is connected to milk run next door so you can grab dessert once you're done.  Since this place is popular, it tends to get a bit busy so service can be a bit slow. However, pho is quickly made once ordered so it's not that big a deal. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone craving pho in phx.",

I'm sorry but when it's 110 degrees + in the summer in Arizona, you need A/C.  Service: We were seated right away at a table near the window. This did not help the no A/C case. They took our order quickly and brought over the food quickly as well.  Food: We ordered pho beef soup and the egg rolls, the pho broth was a bit oily but still tasty and the noodles were okay but we did get some lumpy stuck together noodles. The egg rolls were a little burnt. Overall we would give the food 3/5 stars. The sauces and everything were also very clean.  However, in the end I can only give it 1 star because we were so hot we couldn't even finish our food so we just paid and left. Will not be coming back.",

    "text": "Vietnamese food had never even crossed my mind before, so after someone mentioned Pho Thanh I was interested in trying it. I've been there six times as of now.   The first time I went to the Pho I didn't have time to eat my meal there so I got take out. I got the number 133, which is a charbroiled slab of beef with steamed rice and veggies (posted a pic of this). Although for me it was more like charbroiled fat and bone; it hardly had any beef at all. My friend ordered the same thing, but he actually got a slab of beef. Maybe I was just unlucky and got the bad part of the \"beef\".   On my second trip I got the number 42, which is vermicelli (cold noodles) that come with a pork shrimp sliced egg roll, sliced grilled pork patty, and veggies all in the same big bowl. The pork patty was very good; juicy and tender, the egg roll was good too, and the vermicelli was kind of bland by itself until I mixed it with the veggies which where hidden underneath it, and added a little salt.   On my third time there I got the number 12 beef noodle soup / pho tai. To me, the broth was just OK but nothing special. Thinking that the broth was just a fluke that day, I got the shrimp pho at a later visit and again I wasn't too crazy for the broth. But I've been to the nearby Da Vang and I loved the pho there. I've ordered it twice and both times it has been great...a little on the salty side, but still better than Pho Thanh's for my personal taste.   I've also ordered the number 123, which is beef and a salad, with either rice or bread. I chose mine with rice; it goes great with the beef. The salad was OK. The beef was very juicy and tender. I put some beef in the rice a little at a time. They bring out the beef cut in small cube bite size pieces on a metal plate still sizzling loud enough to get the attention of the other diners.   Also, I've ordered pork shrimp egg rolls as an appetizer, and a banh mi sandwich for take out my four times there. The egg rolls are great; they also come with a plate of veggies and fish sauce to dip the rolls in. I've tried all four sandwiches and my favorite is the number 75 grilled pork sandwich; the patty in this sandwich and the patty that comes with the number 42 are just so juicy and tender! (posted pics of the egg rolls and a sandwich, tho it's the cold cut sandwich)   Inspired by Da Vang's delicious beef stew / bo kho, I decided to try the beef stew with rice noodles here at Pho Thanh. It was a disappointment. The portion is only half of what Da Vang gives you, and the pieces of beef are not tender and are studded with chunks of fat, and there weren't many noddles to speak of, the opposite of Da Vang's. I ended up leaving all the pieces of beef because they had so much fat on them it was impossible to eat around it. It wasn't very filling In the end it wasn't a very good meal. If you want a generous amount of good beef stew I recommend trying it at Da Vang.   Da Vang may have the better beef stew, but Pho Thanh has the better bahn xeo crepe. At Da Vang it's really greasy, rock hard, burnt, and very little filling. Here at Pho Thanh it's perfect; not much grease, pliable, and a generous amount of bean sprout, shrimp, and pork filling.   Having been to both Pho Thanh and Da Vang, I personally prefer Da Vang. Like most Vietnamese places, the prices are great; about less than $10 for a meal, and you will get more than enough food. (Unless you order the beef stew at Pho Thanh lol)",

    "text": "Solid pho, and I don't even have to add the disclaimer  \"..it's good for Phoenix.\"  Subconsciously (or sometimes out loud) I'm usually comparing the quality of Phoenix restaurants to their counterparts in the LA area - I do this for burgers, ramen, carne asada, boba, whatever - and the food in question always comes up short.   But with Pho Than, the soup is not quite, but pretty close to, the kind of pho that you can find in LA.  Trust me, I've tried the pho numerous times at other valley restaurants - Pho Viet, Angelina's, Maxim, and especially Pho Avina (which is pretty good, but comes in a distant second to Pho Than), and the rich, aromatic, and greasy (in a delicious way) broth of Pho Than comes out on top.  And the price can't be beat either.  Two large bowls, 2-3 orders of egg rolls, a combo fried rice, and a Vietnamese iced coffee or two will all come in under $30, easy.  I've tried many of their broken rice dishes and chef specialties, such as the sizzling filet mignon and pork chop, but the value and flavor of the pho cannot be beat.    Service is nonexistent, and if you're not familiar with Asian waitstaff you might interpret the attitude/demeanor of the servers as rudeness or apathy, but don't let that dissuade you from trying this place out.  Don't let the location or exterior dissuade you either.",

Sadly I will be back when I need a pho fix since my options are pretty limited in Phoenix.  The service here leaves much to be desired.

This place is an absolute favorite for my husband and I. Their shrimp fried rice is the best I've ever had! Their pho tai is amazing as well. Something that I would critique is that it seems like they add the beef before it's served vs. while it's being poured. Its not a flavor factor, more like a texture thing. I haven't tried their fried egg rolls only because their spring rolls have me hooked! Typically we order 2 soups, spring rolls and fried rice and pay a teeny bit over $20 (what a STEAL). The service is super fast but I think that there is a serious language barrier between servers and guests therefore it doesn't come off as friendly. Either way, this place is awesome and everyone that we have taken there had been impressed!",

You won't come here for the service, you won't come here for the private dining; what you will come here for is the Pho and if it's any help, it seems the Vietnamese population of Phoenix agrees (by their attendance).  You can find a better broth at a more expensive place but I come here for a quick and simple lunch that never weighs me down and costs close to nothing for the amount of food you get.  Thai tea seems to be the same everywhere so try the egg soda, the coconut drink (still in the coconut) or one of the best lime aids I've ever had.  Tip: Pho plates are on the first page. Skip this and flip to the back of the menu. Here you will find the choice cuts of meat for Pho. If beef, ask for it on the side and you will get some beautiful deep red cuts (try #116). Also, anything other than Pho can take a while to make so stick with the Pho unless you have time.",

I find myself coming here at least twice a week for lunch and sometimes go back for dinner when I have to brag to my friends and family what I ate for lunch.  5 stars for price, cleanliness, fast and efficient service, and delicious food.  There's no other place in cenpho that you can pay less than 10.00 for lunch for TWO people!   The Banh mi is irrestible and filled enough with meat and veggies to be a solid steal for $2.25   The Pho-is PHO-licous!!!! Yes it leaves Da Vang, Maxim and 43 Express in the dust.  Another steal at just $4.50  The #59 Broken Rice Special is divine-especially if you want to get a little taste of everything for only $6.95  Great place for a great price!",

    "text": "We ate here on Friday night.  The food was good, but our server and the location sucks ass.  As soon as we pulled into the parking lot (we got the last parking spot in the whole lot) we were accosted by some cracked out, black dude looking for a couple of bucks.  We told him we had ONE dollar and he looked annoyed that we didn't have more.  I scrounged around in my purse for the dollar as he peppered my husband (who was halfway in the car unbuckling the baby from her carseat) with questions about if we also had some change we could give him too, my husband repeatedly said NO we had ONE dollar.  After I slipped the dollar to my husband he offered it to Mr. Crack Head who promptly snatched it up and started across the parking lot to hit up the other people pulling in, and my husband was so pissed that he didn't even have the decency to say \"thanks\" that he started yelling after him about learning some manners.  Ugh!!   Anyway, we get inside and I have half a mind to complain to the restaurant management that they have someone outside harassing all their patrons, but the cold stare from the less than friendly server we had, a young Vietnamese dude with a neck tattoo, dissuaded me from attempting anything more than giving him my order number.  I can understand that a young man in his mid-twenties (?) probably doesn't want to be working tables in (presumably) his family's restaurant at 7:30 on a Friday night, and I can even imagine that maybe, just maybe, his English isn't that good (but I kinda doubt it, he was probably born and raised in the US, unlike the older man at the register), but I simply can't understand why he couldn't fake a smile for us and make us feel slightly less like annoyances, and more like valued guests here to spend their hard cash and enjoy dinner??       Okay rant over, sorry.  So we both ordered the beef Pho with brisket and the food arrived within a blazingly fast 5 minutes.  The soup was hot, hearty and delicious!  No complaints there.  At the same time we ordered the food we each also ordered the sweet young, whole coconut for drinks and, unfortunately, it took another 10 minutes for the coconuts to arrive.  But when they did arrive they were delicious.  We were never checked on after we had our food and our drinks were dropped off at our table, but I guess that's okay since we didn't need anything else and we were able to make due without our server's cold stare and indifferent attitude.    Anyway, the food is fast, cheap and delicious.  The bill was only $16 for Pho and coconut drinks for 2 adults.  You can't beat that price with a stick.   Minus a star for the awful location.  Minus a star for the crappy server.  Aside from that the food is worth braving the location and service.  I think that if the management could tell 'Neck Tattoo' to smile and pretend to be friendly, and to check on the guests at least once, it'd do A LOT to help with the customer service perception.  Oh, and maybe also invest in a security guard to chase the panhandling, crack head out of the parking lot too...  ;)",

But I found mixing the hot sauce and the peanut sauce made it better.  The place didn't seem so dingy as others have made it out to seem. The two waitors cleaned tables quickly. I saw that people who ate in seemed to given extra time to pursue the menu before being approached.  Somewhere I would be back and look at what other things they have to offer.",

Hearty, flavorful, and extremely satisfying. PHO = BROTH. I would give ten stars for their broth if I could.  I like that they separate the cilantro and onions from the noodles (in the takeout box). I don't mind having raw onion in the broth to add a little more flavor, but I hate that lingering taste.  I would have given them a full five stars, but their chicken meat is rubbery and dry. Probably the quality of the beef is better since beef can be served rare and cook a little in the hot broth, but I don't like fatty meats.   Also, it's a bit pricier than expected for pho. Back home in Colorado, I could get a large bowl of pho for under $6.50. Here, it comes to just under $8.",

And with frustration in his voice he said where. You know that place on camelback I called to make sure they were open. He feel in love. Said it was better then the place in Mesa we go to.

Lacking a half star because the service isn't that great (but you don't go for that) and I've noticed the lemongrass chicken can vary in size between visits. The chicken pho is always top notch. I ask for shrimp spring rolls without the pork and I always get what I want with no issues.  Here's a little guide to Pho Thanh: - There's also parking in the back. - You can seat yourself or wait until you catch the eye of someone working there and they'll air traffic controller style point/wave you to a table. - There are always people eating who work there. Don't be surprised if one of them gets up to take your order before going back to their meal. - Don't expect staff to stand around and chit chat with you. It's probably not going to happen. They act like they're there to feed you and clean up after you and that's it. I should have warned my grandmother and mother to not expect the warm fuzzies when we came here for a family dinner. - Feel free to ask questions or ask for something you need. They are helpful. - DO NOT play with the chopsticks. Seriously. Don't. Would you go somewhere else and play with the silverware? If the answer is yes you need to go back to the cave you came from and learn some manners. The exception to this is if you're in Denny's at 3am. We know you aren't sober. Just don't do anything to get arrested. But really, the table is not your imaginary drum set. You are not a walrus. If you want to play \"swords\" with chopsticks I can help you with that and stab you with one. Parents, please teach your children respect for other cultures, even if this isn't fine dining. - Take food home with you. By the counter there's a rack with containers. Grab what you need. Yes, I know it's customary to eat the noodles right away, but whatever. I'd rather people stop wasting food. It tastes just as good when you're hungry again in a few hours. Their pho is huge. Don't stuff yourself. Get two meals by taking half home. - You pay at the counter. Tell them your table number. If you decide to move tables just make sure you're paying the right ticket. - Never been in an Asian market? There's one right next door. Go get some Pocky. It's only a dollar.",

She got just regular rice stick noodle pho with beef and beef balls. The broth did lack a lot of flavor and being from San Jose, Ca, not good at all. I have definitely had a lot better.  I got the spicy beef soup with vermicelli. I usually wouldn't get anything with vermicelli because I am not a fan, but this was delicious! The soup was spicy and very flavorful. But to be honest, I think that anything spicy is flavorful. There was a lot of meat in it and they did not hold back. I was really happy about that.   I was impressed about the vegetables they gave. They had some banana tree shavings, love it. My mom uses it a lot and it really reminded me of home.   I did not like the sandwich at all. I am use to more meat in vietnamese sandwiches and the bread was too soft. I am use to fresh crunch baguettes.  Not sure I will come back",

Pho Thanh has big giant boals of mouth watering pho soup with amazing broth that will make your nose run (after you load it with all your fresh herbs) and your heart warm. They are not the friendliest people there, but I don't care, the Pho soup is freakin amazing and that's ALL I care about. I truly have not been to a Japanese restaurant that gives you good service anyway, so I would never review on their service. Just try the Pho soup here, it's totally worth the drive no matter where you are coming from. Also, the egg rolls are awesome too, not the spring rolls, the egg rolls. I'm not downing the spring rolls, I just haven't ordered them so I can't give an opinion either way on those. Thanks and have a Happy Day! Fay",

It used to be good, however, lately their Pho has been disappointing. I'm not sure if it is because of high demand, but their broth has lost its flavor, tasting more like it's diluted with water.   Their service is still lightning fast, despite huge demand. Food is still very affordable. Because of declining quality, I have now migrated to Da Vang, a couple of blocks away, which IMO is superior in taste but comparable in price.",

Dare I say it puts the pho in Phoenix *teehee.* I have been looking for good pho since I moved here from Seattle (land of pho every 20 feet) and never found a place that measured up. Generally, the broth was bland and the dish was americanized and way overpriced. Well, look no further, this is the real deal. From the minute you walk in, you can tell this place is more authentic than most. They have communal tables with grab-your-own chopsticks, spoons, condiments, etc. There is no fancy decor. Who needs it when the food is so good? The pho comes out in a large bowl and the price is right (like 6$). I had the Pho filet and the broth was flavorful,  the meat was tender, and the noodles were abundant. I also had a legit Thai Tea. I came here with an unexpected group of 7 people (I think... Amanda B and her daughter, Irene V, Amy H, Jon H, Rachelle H, and some others) and the restaurant accommodated (despite being very busy and mostly thanks to Irene V). I will certainly be back here in the near future!",

They offer many, many varieties, but in just one size each super reasonably priced and delicious.  My wife and I consider ourselves Pho connoisseurs, addicted to this fabulous warm comfort food from back east.  Being relative newcomers to the Phoenix Area, we have begun our Pho finding adventure of discovering the best the region has to offer.  After hitting a few local joints previously we've discovered how good Pho Thanh is!  The staff is prompt, accommodating, succinct and helpful - not to mention the huge dining area, its cleanliness and appealing environs.  Don't expect fine furniture, creative decor or table linens, as this is a neighborhood soup kitchen, but, til now, our fave for Pho!  My wife's favorite Pho Tai (Slices of rare eye-round steak) was tender and tasty. My all-time favorite, Pho Tai Nam (Slices of rare eye-round steak and well-done brisket) was exquisite with fascinating whiffs of aromas that scintillate ones palate and desire for the homey broth.  Not all Pho Joints are created equal.  Pho Thanh, unlike many other places locally, offers you all the amenities and condiments (other places make you ask for it - if they have it) fully required accoutrements to compliment and perfect the bowls of aromatic decadence. Their servings will include platters full of lime wedges, bean sprouts, jalapenos, fresh cilantro, along with a great table selection of add-ons!  If you're a devout Pho lover, or a novice looking to expand your horizons in the comfort food arena - Pho Thanh is for you.  We highly recommend them, and plan to continue enjoying their fab Viet foods beyond Pho!  Bon appetit!",

    "text": "My first ever foray into pho.  The place is easy enough to find, though the parking lot is shared with other businesses in the complex, and thus, parking was a little dicey on a Saturday night.  The place has a large interior space with ample seating, and my friend and I were seated quickly.  Their menu has a lot to offer, but the main event is definitely the pho. I ordered simply for my first try, going with basic sliced beef. All the side garnishes were fresh (bean sprouts, basil, cilantro, lime wedges) and there were a few condiments to add (chili paste, sriracha, fish sauce, etc).  The pho was served steaming hot and the broth was complex and delicious. The beef was just okay, it suffered a bit by being on the dry and overcooked side. The noodles were pretty standard. I didn't realize that the pho would come with as much cilantro in it as it did, and being that I'm not a big fan of the stuff, it tended to overwhelm. I tried to pick around it but the damage was mostly done because it was all throughout the bowl. If you're a cilantro lover, you'll be happy. If you're a member of Team Cilantro Haters, not so much.  Their hours are a bit quirky. They technically close at 8:30pm but they still seat people up to 8:15, so be aware.  I may return eventually, or I may hit up another pho/Vietnamese joint if the urge to try more pho strikes. It's a toss up.",

But I was ushered to a small table right at the entrance. What the F**k!! I refused to sit there and demanded an inside table.  As others had said, it is hard to find half decent Pho in Phoenix. Since Vietnamese restaurants are few in Phoenix, so you wouldn't be surprised the services are at the low end of the spectrum compare with LA, SanFran, or Las Vegas.  The food is OK, 3Stars.",

Pho Thanh is in my neighborhood and I've driven past this little restaurant on the north west corner of 17th Ave. and Camelback so many times. My regular Pho place was closed on Wednesdays, so I decided to give them a try. It doesn't always look the most inviting on the outside. And parking is tight. It was a nice surprise to see how big they are on the inside. Seeing a lot of Thai/Vietnamese people in a Pho restaurant is always a good sign. Like you got the low-down on some inside secret. Anyway, I ordered Chicken Pho $7.25 . Lots of chicken, rice noodles, basil, lime wedges, cilantro, bean sprouts, sliced jalapeno rounds. 2 sauces. I also ordered a couple of their rice paper pork and shrimp rolls $2.50 each. Clean and neat, to go order was ready in 15 minutes. I got a Thai tea to go from their Milk Bar. My roommate went back the next day to pick us up more Pho.   Chicken Pho cures whatever ails you.",

Both times I ordered pho tai nam.  The dish is noodles in beef stock broth with slices of beef and brisket.  The bowl is dirt cheap (maybe $5 or $6).  Not only is the dish tasty but its easily one of the best values to be found at any restaurant in Phoenix and the surrounding area.  On my next visit I will expand my Vietnamese horizons and try something new.  The menu has well over 100 items to choose from.  Pho Thanh may not be in the best area and the strip center parking lot is small (and, sadly, filled with the vehicles of folks that have no clue how to park a car) but this place is a must visit.  If you're a fan of Asian cuisine in general or just looking to try something new. Pho Thanh is well worth your time.",

    "text": "I tried Pho Thanh today after much hype. I read about it in the Phoenix New Times \"Best Of Phoenix 2011\" and felt like if it got a great review then I should put it on the list.   Here is a run down of the order:   Spring Rolls  Lean Pork Sammich Pho with Filet  Broken Rice Thai Tea  We wanted to try a lot of food to get an idea of what the place was like and  even asked the waiter what the most popular items on the menu were. I usually don't opt for a fancy cut of meat in Pho but I decided to try it at his recommendation.   Spring Rolls- They tasted old and my dining partner said \"it tastes like each ingredient\". What he meant was, it felt like he was eating rice paper, pork, etc. It didn't feel cohesive. When I tried it I thought the rice paper was gummy and the roll was super bland. The peanut sauce on the side was also a little meh.   Lean Pork Sammich- I like the addition of pickled daikons but the meat was lacking. The waiter commented that there was a lot of seasoning but I felt it was bland.   Pho- Oh dear. I was so looking forward to a great tender slice of filet in a rich, complex broth. I was truly disappointed in this dish. The broth was flat (my dining partner agreed) and the noodles were a bit off. They almost tasted old or undercooked. They stuck together and were chewy. (If you want good Pho, Da Vang is a good option. I am still on the lookout for more options)   Broken rice- My dining partner had this one and liked it, but didn't love it. I know when he loves things and this didn't wow him at all. I wish I had more commentary on this. Sorry.   Thai Tea- It is pretty hard to fuck up Thai tea. This was executed well.   I am going to possibly give this place one more shot. I liked the waitstaff, the restaurant was clean and the prices were very fair. We walked out with a bill of $20, which is pretty crazy.",

Not the best I've had, but at the price, really good and fulfilling.  When I've carried out: had the bun thit nuon.  Great stuff. Mi xao and hu tieu xao were just ok.  I like that the whole place is very big (from a recent expansion, I'm reading).   The bathrooms are pretty good and the service is not too typical Viet: actually friendly-ish and not too rude/brusque.  I would come back again for sure. The prices are what you would find in California, so that is just too good to pass up.",

Though it has changed names from Pho Bang to Pho Thanh, it still serves good pho.  The place has expanded to the space next door and it was updated slightly with the new name and ownership.  Most all entree items are worth the try and the Pho Tai is most certainly a perfect choice.  The staff that serves and cleans may seem unfriendly or miserable but they will get you what you want.  Get vocal and do not feel intimidated, just do not be rude.  I have never had an issue here but then again don't have to look at the menu to order what I want.

I tried so many other Vietnamese restaurants in the greater Phoenix area and none comes close.  For those who really dig for real Vietnamese food - Try their sandwiches between Wed - Fri.  They usually run out of the sandwich supplies after Friday.  Just remember those tasty sandwiches will make you smell funny for a while...in case you sit really close to a sensitive coworker.  I can't think of any dishes not to try..they are all economical and authentic.  If I must complain on something then it would be the meat they use for Pho (the soup).  If you want it authentic then you can't ask for quality meats so it's a catch 22.  Otherwise, this restaurant tend to provide more varieties of veggies that go along with the soup.  We always get great services here, and yes you have to bring your bill to the check-out counter.  And no, please do not keep bothering the owner during the checkout process, you will just end up making other people behind you very pissed off.  My ex-boss embarrassed the *** out of the group by keep asking for samples on those \"green-looking drinks\"...not cool, don't do that.",

Of course, everything's relative so maybe I'll adjust after trying some other viet places around.    Ordered bo nuong la nho (beef wrapped in grape leaves), com tam tau hu ky  thit nuong (broken rice with shrimp/beancurd and bbq pork), and canh chua ca (tamarind soup with catfish). Canh chua was pretty good - nice balance of flavors with okra, pineapple, bean sprouts, etc.  The beef/grape leaves had a good flavor but the meat itself was a little bit dry.  The bun noodles it was served with was dry. One of my pet peeves at vietnamese restaurants it old bun that has been sitting out. It's cheap and takes a few minutes to boil...just make a new batch! Really disappointed in the broken rice.  The bean curd was stale, not crispy like it should have been.  The thit nuong flavor and texture were weird -  def not like any thit nuong I've seen before.  If I'm back I won't be ordering that again. I haven't tried the pho broth but my friend said it was decent on a previous visit.    Price was where it should be (cheap!) for a Vietnamese restaurant.  The place is pretty large and had a lot of guests during our visit.  Don't expect great service. If you need something, flag them down and ask.  That's just how it works.",

Holey mother of all that is holey, what a killer dish. I'm pretty sure some Vietnamese dude was hammered one night and was like (in cool Vietnamenglish) \"What do I have in the refrigerator? I got some rice. I got some BBQ pork. I got some shredded pork. I got some meatballs wrapped in grape leaves. I got some scallions. and Ive got an egg.\" and in True drunk munchy fashion, concocted one of my favorite dishes.   The dish was perfect in every way imaginable. I did add a touch of soy for salt and some of the red pepper paste they gave me, but other than that it was poifect. My takeout lunch cost me $7.50, but I should say that it ended up costing me $over $500 because that's probably how much I'll spend this year going back all the time. Two thumbs up and a big ole Pho slurp to the dope Vietnamese drunk guy that, more than likely, invented that dish!!!",

Honestly, my wife and I have been to almost every vietnamese place in town, and the spring rolls here are spectacular because they will substitute chicken in place of pork.  I had the Pho with filet steak and it was the bomb! Super fresh ingredients, juicy and tender meat and no sign of MSG headache afterwards.  So we go here about twice a week now, and we try all the stuff on the menu and it is all GREAT!!  Very casual dress here.",

The prices are so inexpensive.  The food is comfort food like no other.  Damn it was good.  The location is not the greatest but I will risk it.",

    "text": "For a year, I passed by Pho Thanh every day on my way to work. For a year, I never thought once to step inside. For a year, I had no idea how much I was missing out!   This visit was a visit of firsts. My first time at this restaurant and my first time eating Vietnamese food. Both were spectacular! This restaurant isn't much to look at on the outside, but it's got everything it needs on the inside including friendly staff, cheap prices and delicious dishes.   I will admit that the menu is completely overwhelming for a newbie like me. I had no idea what I wanted, but luckily I was dining with pros so they guided me in the right direction. I started with the spring rolls and opted for a pork bun. The spring rolls were really refreshing and I enjoyed the peanut sauce to accompany it. I wasn't a huge fan of the basil and/or cilantro that came inside, so next time I would ask for them to leave the herbs out. The bun was delicious and huge! I snuck some of my remaining peanut sauce in there and poured in the sauce that came with it. I had no idea that it was fish sauce but I'm glad I didn't because I gave it a chance and really liked it! The bun had pork, noodles and eggs rolls. I only ate about half of it and was completely stuffed but not in a bad way. It was the perfect amount of food with the right spices and heartiness. As I enjoyed my meal and company, I looked around and noticed how crowded this place gets with every walk of life!  Guess how much my bill was for spring rolls, bun and a diet coke? Around $8-$10. I'm serious! For the price alone, I will return, but for the food and friendly service, I will return sooner.",

It was very evident by most of the patrons actually being Vietnamese, you know it must be good.  You just walk in and sit anywhere that's open and someone will bring you their menu which is quite extensive.  I had my favorite, which is Pho Tai.  The broth was perfect, and had a pretty complex flavor profile.  Hard to explain, but some pho broth's are very 1-dimensional...this one was exceptionally flavorful.  They don't skimp on the meat either, which some places tend to do.  I've been to Vietnamese restaurants all over the valley, and although I have still never been to Da Vang...I'd venture to say this might be the best pho in Phoenix.  Tastes darn close to the stuff you get in CA, in Garden Grove/Westminster/Little Saigon.  Also, it is dirt cheap! $4.50 for a big delicious bowl of pho tai....yum.  I'll be back soon for sure.",

    "text": "Coming from the Pacific NW with an abundance of Vietnamese food, I was disappointed that a city the size of Phx doesn't have a very good vietnamese line-up.  Pho Thanh (which I think was formerly Pho Bang and now has new owners) was a pleasant surprise.  My review isn't as verbose as some of the other experts here.  However, I will go as far as to say that  we have found our little piece of Saigon in the desert.  The Vietnamese Spring Rolls are fantastic and only $2.25 for two large fresh shrimp and pork!  Usually pho variations shouldn't be much different from restaurant to restaurant (cause if you mess up pho, you won't stay in business).  Pho Thanh's Pho definitely stands out above any others I've tried.    After our first visit, we only lasted 72 hours before having to return.  The wait staff is very very friendly and helpful to people new to Vietnamese food.    Oh yah, an entry is around $5 and you will definitely have left-overs.  And, unlike some other Asian cuisine, Vietnamese is very very good for you.  There isn't an item on the menu that is even fried.  All fresh ingredients.",

    "text": "This family runs a great business! For the Phoenix area, they run a very clean, inexpensive, and certainly authentic Vietnamese dining experience. Don't throw them under the bus and compare them to some of the greats in Orange County or San Fran, those places are in a league of their own. :)   Thanh himself, is a young guy, whom you will usually find seating you when you visit the restaurant. His parents do much of the cooking and other work in the restaurant.   Everything that I have tried so far in this place has been great! The Cafe Sua Da is brewed fresh in a cup at your table while you eat your meal, which is nice, as many of these places have begun to serve pre-made Cafe Sua da. If you aren't familiar with what I am speaking of, it's a very strong coffee that is brewed by the cup and then poured over condensed milk, stirred, then poured into a glass of ice and stirred once more. You won't mess with Starbucks after trying this brew. It's simple, strong, and has a nice kick, along with some anti-oxidizing effects. ;)   The simple, but classic Pho Thai, which consists of Rice Noodles, Pho Stock, and Thin slices of beef that are placed in the Pho bowl just as they are served, is flavorful and great for a newcomer to the Vietnamese Cuisine. It is accompanied with the typical plate of condiments, which you can add to your own discretion and liking. The plate includes the following fresh items: Bean Sprouts, Fresh Basil Leaves, Lime, Jalapeno Slices, and Mint Leaves. A good Pho, won't require adding Sriracha or any other sauces to the Pho itself. Don't be a NOOB and do this. Mix your Sriracha or Chili Oil with Hoison Sauce in the little sauce dish at the table and dip your beef in it before eating. If you like onions, order Hanh Dam with your dish. It's sliced onions in rice vinegar, be sure to spice them up with Sriracha when they bring them to your table, and eat them along with the beef or a bite of your Pho, it's a great addition to your meal.   The broken rice dishes that I have tried have been great as well. Broken rice, is simply that, Rice that has been broken in half by a special machine. It really changes the texture of the rice in a good way. The Pork Chop that I had with mine was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. It was served with a fried egg, bean curd wrapped shrimp cake, shredded pork skin, and some grilled shrimp. For less than $7.00, its better than one of those secret steak and shrimp meals that you will find in some of the Vegas Casino's, and will fill you up for sure. Be sure to use the fish sauce to drizzle on your meal. Don't smell it, just add a little chili oil, and drizzle it over your dish. I use the whole bowl, it adds so much great flavor to the dish.   The Spring Rolls were the standard with Pork and Shrimp inside, and served with the Peanut Sauce. Be sure to add a little Chili Oil to the sauce before dipping.   The Egg rolls, which will be ordered by most white people were great as well. It's difficult to screw up fried foods. Be sure that you wrap the egg rolls in the lettuce and add some mint leaves to the wrap before dipping in the fish sauce that you hopefully added a little chili oil to.   The Fresh Coconut Water is served proper, in a freshly cracked coconut. You get the whole thing as you should, whereas some of these places around here will just serve you a small glass along with some of the meat from the coconut inside.   They also serve the Vietnamese Sandwiches here, which I recommend. The BBQ Pork is probably the best one, served on a fresh french roll with Cilantro, Carrots, Jalapeno, and Cucumber. For $2.50, you can't beat it. You can actually take these home and throw them in the refrigerator for later.  Thanh himself usually clears and cleans the tables immediately after someone leaves. The service here has always been great, and very quick, considering that the place is usually full everyday at lunch time.  If you are new to Vietnamese Cuisine, I highly recommend Pho Thanh. Be brave, and try new things, you have no idea what you are missing. They don't serve anything odd, and if it didn't taste good, then it wouldn't be on the menu, so don't be so white, and give it a try. You will love it, I promise! :)",

I went this afternoon with three of my buddies and was lucky enough to sample a number of dishes.  First, I should say this place was VERY busy even at 11:30 on a Sunday.  The spring rolls and egg rolls were great, as was my pho tai and my buddy's lemongrass chicken. Service was a little slow but really-this place was PACKED.  Mostly with Asian people, a good sign.

And the decor/cleanliness is decent, typical Vietnamese restaurant.  The spring rolls here are the best I've had in Phoenix (and the cheapest!).  Their spring rolls are around $2.50 where everywhere else it's at least $4-5.  The pho was okay, though I wish it had come with a bit more meat and that the meat had not been so well-done (I like it on the medium rare side).

They've expanded a lot throughout the years and has many 5 star reviews on yelp.....but, their food is still the same. Mediocre at best! Pho broth has this off putting flavor, that im not used too. the cuts of meat were too fatty and some were thick and chewy!  The rice dish my husband ordered was just okay, nothing great.  Maybe im just used to my regular go to pho joint, pho 43 on thomas. Oh, and as for service....there is none. Menus were given without a single word said. Throughout our meal, no one bothered to fill our drinks or hell, they never even looked in our direction! I mean i would cut them some slack if they were, lets say....on their lunch break....but nope, just standing around, doing nothing.",

A gentlemen took ordered, he had terrible English while attempting to take my order. Though a noble gesture, I did not realize, I had to go to the chaser to pay. I patiently waited, as the cashier attended the line until my turn. She quickly took my money and said about 10 mins and piled my order on Top of a big stalk. I waited 20 and walked up to the counter to ask the same cashier who took the order. First she didn't remember me because she thought I was In Line to order. She asked me what I ordered and looked at all the other orders and turned up empty handed. She couldst locate the tag she charged my card to trace it back. By then, I was hungrier and getting agitated. I asked for my money back, which took them longer than their food to be ready. They never apologized or attempted to correct their error. I do hear their food is good if u like mediocre pho at best. Go to the pho near 19th ave and Osborn, they are fantastic and they acknowledge you as a person. Plus their pho is delicious, and they are very friendly people! I honestly hope y'all have a better experience than I.",

Large bowls of steaming broth that you add a bit of this and that to until you have the perfect potion to make the day melt away. So I did a search to see what was around and came to this place. When I pulled up I was a bit concerned the shabby appearance does not instill confidence. But I've always been one for adventure so I carried on. The inside of the restaurant is clean, well lit and just what a pho place should be. The staff is the same, they are direct and to the point. Setting down our waters and asking \"what you want\" I don't mind this abruptness when the food is good. I ordered summer rolls and pho with rare beef and brisket. And that is when the disappointment started. The peanut sauce was watery and lacking, the rolls them selves where at best ok. The pork inside of them was tough and unseasoned. The pho was good, better then ok but nothing to write home about.  It was a little sad this place has the right stuff for a hole in the wall gem but could not deliver when it came to food. I won't be in a rush to go back, way to many other places to explore first!",

They sat us at large table with another family, which was totally fine but it was akward, not going to lie. It's almost like cafeteria seating. We ordered our food and within at least 3 minutes everything was at the table, which means nothing was really made fresh.   1) Let's start with the spring rolls, they were good, obviously pre-made (you can tell by the wrapper) - the dipping sauce was liquid and had ZERO taste to it. I don't recommend the sauce but I do the roll.  2) The beef with broccoli was disgusting, the meat was thin and white/gray in color. Shrived up little pieces of meat.  3) ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE. Felt like cattle, move them in, move them out.   4) Pho was awful. So much oil in the broth. Meat was over cooked. Not good. Lips felt really oily.   If you're looking for Pho, check out Da Vang which is less than a mile away.",

Pho Thanh really hits home for me with its rare offerings like Thit Bo Cuon La Luop (Vietnamese beef in grape leaves) or its pork blood porridge.  \"Wait, what, that's disgusting, pork BLOOD porridge? Russell, that's disgusting!\" Hey, foods from foreign cuisine tend to challenge our pre-conceived notions of what is acceptable and what isn't. Ask any Vietnamese person, they've had it before. it's not that bad, in fact, some ascribe the texture to tofu.  But I'm digressing; Pho Thanh has the word \"pho\" in it, so logically, you come in here expecting some damn good quality pho. And damn, is it some good quality pho! I get the special combination beef pho, which has everything from rare steak to brisket to tripe in a delicious broth that's been cooked for hours before the restaurant opens at 8:15 AM daily. Not to mention the plate of veggies including bean sprouts, basil and lime. AND, what most pho places in Phoenix will not serve on the vegetable platter is the infamous \"saw tooth herb\" which is perceived as possessing healing qualities. I'm not sure how True that is, but damn, does it go well with the beef meatballs in Pho Thanh's pho soup!  I also frequently order the broken rice dishes. Man, not only are they vibrant in color, but they're just so damn good. You get a combination of meats, vegetables, rice, soup, vegetables again, it's just so damn good.  Look, come on in, sit yourself down, and order your grub. BTW, look at the menu online ahead of time, these types of traditional Vietnamese places will NOT be patient with you; you're there to eat, they're there to get you to eat quickly and turn the table just as fast.",

Parking is a nightmare and every time we've gone here, we've been approached by someone needing change for something.  The broth is worth the struggles.",

    "text": "I have been on the hunt for good pho ever since I moved to Phoenix.  I'm originally from Denver, but lived in LA for a year, so I've had some goooood pho.  I've tried a couple of different places since I've been here, but really didn't enjoy any of them...  And then I discovered Pho Thanh.  It looka a little sketchy and uninviting from the outside and parking was a little difficult (pro-tip: we actually discovered a huge parking lot in the back.  There are some signs that say additional parking is available in the back, but they're not entirely visible!), but this place is great.  I came here with a coworker for lunch and it was SO BUSY and PACKED.  There's nothing special about the interior.  It's plain and simple, but this place is HUGE.  Yet despite how crowded this place was, the staff was able to quickly seat us, take our order, and deliver our food.  And oh my god.  Their pho was absolutely delicious!  The broth was fresh and flavorful, the portion was generous, they had a ton of condiments on their table, the vegetables were fresh, and everything was reasonably priced! It tasted like home!   Also, their menu is HUGE.  If you don't like pho, but you like authentic Vietnamese food, this place has it all!  My coworker isn't too big on Yelp, but said to me, \"this place is amazing! you better give them five stars!\" I couldn't agree more.  Fantastic service, fantastic food. I'm definitely going to become a regular here.",

No friendliness or smiles, no checking on you during your meal or seeing if your may want more to drink or to add to order or anything of the sort. Also they don't pay your check at the table you have to do it at the cashier. But they don't tell you so you'll be making eye contact  with your waiter and he won't come over and know one is going to let you know that.

Water gets brought over but not refilled, you have to walk up to get own to-go cups, walk up to pay. They won't bring a check out to you****** that's important to know otherwise you will just be sitting there.  Overall- casual, cheap, quick, easy in and out, pretty good pho. Just don't expect service. With this, we tipped as if we were ordering take-out and not dining in since we essentially did everything ourselves anyway.. so not 20%. Justifie",

Lol to those who think there is a competition to Da Vang or Pho Thanh, the owners are siblings. It is not too pricey. I love their Filet Pho. The meat is very juicy and thicker than usual side beef. The only thing about the place that stops me from going here to eat is that they close seasonly during Lunar New Year for roughly a month. I understand that Lunar New Year is a very important celebration and people celebrate it for at least 2 weeks to a month. Thus, I give them an excuse to close since I don't think they close on other short 1-day holidays.  I usually don't order rice here because their fish sauce isn't good. It is too sour. I have to add more sugars but it still doesn't taste as good.",

We gave Pho Thanh multiple tries but I can say with complete confidence that there are other Vietnamese restaurants in the valley with amazing food, cheap prices, and high quality service, such as Da Vang or PT Noodles. Seriously though, you can skip Pho Thanh.   Upon entering this place we were ignored and stared at, so we picked a table. It was so awkward because this place had no music playing, customers were eating in awkward silence, and you have the staff slamming dishes in the background. We waited to be served. After 20 minutes no one helped us. We walked up to the cashier and got the menus by ourselves. We only had one waiter walk up towards our table to only ask us if were using the table next to us. We waited up to 35 minutes and still received no service. Also, this was an okay day for the restaurant. It wasn't too busy or slow at all. My parents had to call them in Vietnamese for assistance.   When taking our order, no surprise, they were even more rude to a point that my dad commented how they treat their customers like beggars because this restaurant knows they cook good food. Additionally, my mother overheard them gossiping in Vietnamese about the other customers behind the other customers' backs. This is coming from someone whose family used to own a Vietnamese restaurant and I'm giving everyone a heads up that this is not normal behavior for Vietnamese restaurants. Customers should not be treated like this. Unfortunately, their food cannot beat their consistent terrible customer service.",

    "text": "Very conflicted with this review.... though, I realllllly want to give it 2 stars, my counterpart has made me a big ole softy.  We came here on a Wednesday night around 6pm - it was pretty busy already but there were about 10 empty tables. There was a \"Please wait to be seated\" sign near the door. We stood there with our eyes wandering around the place trying to lock eyes with a server, host, busboy... somebody, anybody that worked there. So, after what felt like an eternity, a girl came with two glasses pointed and told us to sit down. After sitting down, our eyes was on another hunt for someone to come to acknowledge us and take our orders. Once the order was placed, the food came quickly but was never checked on again. To pay, you go up to the cashier and guess what? There was a wait there as well!  I had the bun bo hue and the boyfriend had the bun thit nuong cha gio (vermicelli with charbroiled pork and egg roll - do you guys see a pattern with the boyfriend? you have you check out the other Vietnamese restaurants to get this). I ordered extra huyet (blood cubes) which I got unfortunately, the blood cubes had a denser consistency than I preferred but overall, the dish was tasty. He said his dish was tasty too.   Long story short, I don't like to be ignored and I don't like to wait. If you're like me, this is probably not the place for you.   Oh yeah, the prices here are slightly higher than Da Vang.  Da Vang was the first Vietnamese sit-down place I've been to out here and I still like it there. It's kinda like a first love but in a form of a Vietnamese restaurant. lol",

    "text": "When I realized I would be stopping by Phoenix, I asked my Phoenix food experts what was recommended in the area. My dad had been craving pho since Flagstaff, but all the pho restaurants in that area closed super early. Daniel L. recommended Pho Thanh, and from his review - it seemed like one of the better pho places in the area.   Pho Thanh was close to our hotel and pretty easy to find. It's located in a moderate sized plaza with a good number of parking. This Vietnamese restaurant is pretty big. I think they have been expanding more and more due to the number of return customers. The restaurant closes at 8 PM, and we arrived at 7:45 thinking that we might not make it; however, they still take customers up to the very last minute (or so it seemed). People were walking in at 8 on the dot! I guess the kitchen doesn't close right at 8, which is nice. We were told to sit at any table - one side of the restaurant was closed off, but there was a good number of tables on the other open half.   Menu is not too complicated. They actually serve hot pot here, but we came for pho, so that's what we stuck with.   Fresh pork and shrimp spring rolls: $2.50 for a serving of 2 rolls. A lot of pho restaurants in LA no longer serve spring rolls because of the uncertainty of the rice paper. I was so glad I got to try Pho Thanh's spring rolls because they were pretty amazing. I wouldn't say they're on Brodard's level, but they were really tasty. One couple actually came into the restaurant and ordered 10 orders of spring rolls for their meal. Yep, the rolls were stuffed with shrimp, pork, and other vegetable items. The peanut dipping sauce was also very fresh - had a hard time sharing this item with my parents because it was so good!   I ordered the Pho Tai Bo Vien - sliced beef with meatballs; price was only $5.95 - a steal compared to what you pay in the SGV! And the bowls were pretty big ... super filling meal after a day of driving. The slices of beef are not as thinly cut or as tender as I've experienced, but the flavor was good. There was actually way more beef slices and meatball pieces than I expected. After eating my way through the bowl, I was surprised to find that I still had more slices resting on the bottom of the bowl! Noodles were standards. The broth was tasty! Good flavor and taste, although my dad still thinks that Pho Pasteur has the best broth in terms of flavor.   The original Pho Dac Biet comes with sliced beef, meatballs, brisket, tendon and tripe for $6.45. Tons of ingredients and a good amount of noodles. I'd recommend ordering this if you're not sure what to order and want to try a little of everything.   Service was fast and attentive considering the fact that we stayed past 8. We were in and out within 30 minutes, and there was still a good number of tables filled when we left.   tl;dr - A good and solid place to get pho if you're in Phoenix. Highly recommend ordering their spring rolls! They seem to produce quality items no matter what you order, but I enjoyed the beef/meatball pho. Prices are a steal!",

I like that they keep extra utensils (forks, spoons, extra plates and scissors) out for the guests to self serve. I like as little human interaction as possible LOL  The service is straight to the point. They're not going to stand around all day and kiss your ass. I'm sorry but get used to it. Luckily I'm accustomed to it and enjoyed not being bothered sometimes.   We usually order cafe sua da, pennywort drink, pho, com tam with bi and bbq pork chops, the spring roll and eggrolls. The quality of the dishes have never gone down or varied from visit to visit.   The prices here are also the best in Phoenix. You can get a rice dish for under $6 and the banh mi is only $3.50. Three of us went in and only spent about $25 and left with full bellies.   I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone trying Vietnamese food for the first time :)",

I have turned my back on my Mexican roots and taken on pho as my new hangover cure, illness comfort, and I'm poor and starving meal, over menudo. What's great about it is that it's available every day of the week. Unlike menudo when Saturdays and Sundays are it.   I do like pho thanh but I don't feel that the meat is as high quality as some other places I've had pho. But it's well enough. The service is equally as terrible as Da Vang which is another place I like to get pho. I don't know. Sometimes there are flies all around my fixings. I don't like that. Sometimes the servers seem disgruntled that I want to come in and eat. I don't think I have ever done anything to them... Sheesh. Anywho, I like the location as it's pretty close to my house. I like that I can order a Thai tea with my hot bowl of awesomeness. I like that it is next to a nail supply store, which can get dangerous.   Hmmmm, over all I have to say that I patronize this place because it is close, inexpensive, and relatively good pho.",

Was looking at the menu for a minute or two when I was asked by a server if I was eating there or to go. He then took my order. I got the meatball pho soup (no noodles) for $2.95 or so, as well as a fried rice with chicken for $6.25. To drink I got a coffee...  The Pho: I liked it. I think I'm okay with pho as long as I don't put any sauce in it.... don't know why they serve it with it lol. But either way, it was a nice bowl and I couldn't even finish all of the broth. But it had good meat and some veggies with it.   The Rice: The rice was great. It was very good and a good portion. Took most of it to go because I was pretty full from the pho. But am looking forward to eating the other half for lunch tomorrow.   The Coffee: So because of the amazing coffee I had at Maxim I was hoping it would be the same here... it was the same type, only they brought the thing to the table over a cup in a cup of water.... and once it finished dripping (by then it was kind of cold tbh) then you could drink it..... maybe I just didn't do something right but it wasn't nearly as good.... it was way too sweet but not that bad. Probably won't get it here again.   Overall... will likely be back.",

At most vietnamese restaurants i usually get pho vegetarian. Ordered it here and it was ok. So i tried a tamarind hot and sour soup;  its called Canh Chua Chay it is really yummy,  tastes just like the name says hot and sour. The flavours play nicely on your tougue. And its satisfying and filling. Seriously its never been a disappointment. Fresh rolls are good,  peanut sauce is fine. Ive also had their fried rice and that is good too.  They have fresh coconut. In its natural shell. This is a point to make as not all Vietnamese restaurants carry the fresh young coconut. Pho Thanh is very close up their as one of my favourite Vietnamese restaurants in Az.",

That same courtesy is not extended when ordering to go. I have ordered to go three different times (Twice around 6pm on a Wednesday , once around 5pm on a Friday). All of these orders were placed 30 minutes in advance so that it would be ready once I got there to pick it up. All three times the order wasn't ready and I had to wait almost 30 minutes for them to make it (which was the whole point of me ordering in advance). When I went to pick up my take out order earlier this evening, they had no record of my order. He accused me of calling the wrong restaurant. When I showed them the number that I called and confirmed that it was in fact their restaurant, he might as well have said \"oh well\". He didn't offer to make it right by jumping my order to the front of the line. He didn't even apologize for their screw up. Pho restaurants are a dime a dozen now in the valley and I will definitely be finding another place to get my pho fixed.",

You want to-go containers, you walk over to the rack and get them. It's very low key, which I know is a turn off for a lot of people. But I go for the food. I have no problem doing things for myself.

It's different than what I'm used too.. they add cha and a lot of dried garlic flakes in it. The only down sides were that they skimped on the noodles (I love noodles and I can't just eat meat by itself), it was pretty oily, and that the some of the beef were chewy because it was super fatty. :( I liked how they had the spicy sauce on the side for the Bun Bo Hue!!  My Mom, Dad, and sister's boyfriend weren't as thrilled about their dishes. They just thought it was okay. It wasn't bad nor amazing. It's definitely a good alternative if I'm in AZ. I will be back when I visit my sister!  The place could be cleaner. The restroom was not up to par. There was a guy who kept asking for money outside. :T",

The patrons were primarily (but not exclusively) Vietnamese families.   My wife enjoyed her tofu and vegetable stir fry. I had a delicious pork plate.

I enjoyed these, but unfortunately I didn't order them vegetarian, and the meat detracted from them.  I ordered the Vermicelli bowl with pork and egg roll, and it was a very large portion. The egg rolls were good, but the pork was fatty and pretty unappetizing.  Their Thai tea was too strong. It was too sweet and too dark at the same time. I will have to water it down next time.  The ambiance is pleasant. It took a while to understand if I'm supposed to order, wait to be seated, how to pay, etc.; and the staff was too preoccupied to help a newbie white boy wandering out of his element, but I eventually was served and once seated, the food came quickly.  It's a shame that it's located so close to two other Vietnamese restaurants. I live 30 minutes away from any of them, and Pho Thanh, Maxim or DaVang would all be regular hangouts for me if one was by my house. Luckily I work close to the three, so I'll settle with a lunch at each at least once a month. They all have something better than the other, and I am anxious to try the pho here.  *update* I've been back numerous times, and the food is good, and the value is great. I think the cleanliness is a huge positive. I've upgraded from 2 to 3 stars. It's still not my favorite, and I'd prefer that they had more chicken or tofu dishes, but it deserves 3 of 5.",

I'm a big carnivore, but even I thought the spring rolls lacked veggies, too much meat and pretty tasteless. Service was HORRIBLE! You're lucky if u can even get some eye contact with the service once your meal has been served. Soda was served straight from the can - no glass, not even a straw.

I went on a Saturday about 11am and was a bit confused by the customer formed order line vs. paying customer line. We were pleasant enough to allow the next person in line to go through ahead of us and I placed my order for vegetarian spring rolls on rice vermicelli and egg noodles served with stir fry vegetables with NO TOFU. I waited off to the side by the take out cartons and was impressed by how quickly the staff got the food out to the tables and the fact that the entire restaurant was full, consisted of a mixed crowd and people obviously loving what they were eating. My food came about 15 minutes after I placed my order and I raced home to eat. Unfortunately, there was shrimp in my \"veggie\" egg rolls. My mother is deathly allergic, thankfully, I am not but I don't like shrimp at all. Luckily, I spotted them and just pulled them out. My veggie noodle stir fry had tons of tofu in it, so I pulled that out as well. The food was good but I was upset that they didn't really pay close attention to my order. I'll definitely go again, but I'll dine in, so if my order is incorrect, I can have them fix it. I'll also try Da Vang to see how they compare.",

Young thug wannabes as servers complete with neck tattoos and \"i don't care\" attitudes. My wife ordered the beef Pho and was well pleased with all aspects of the tasty soup and lean beef. Plenty of garnish choices made for a nice meal for her. I ordered the #80 clay pot catfish. Again, taste wise, it was really good. Portion size however, was very small. Two pieces of catfish (not filet), some broth and a couple of stalks of green onion. After removing skin and bones, there actually was very little fish there. We ordered an additional catfish dish to take home to my son. When we got home, there were two half portions of rice in the bag. Nothing else. We went back and while they did apologize, the reason was \"we are busy\". Uh, yeah. Even though the food is quite tasty, the small portions, lack of customer service and \"I don't care attitude\" translates to WE WON'T BE BACK.",

    "text": "I'm from California & I remembered about this restaurant the last time I visited Arizona 5 years ago.   Actually about 5 years ago, I remembered this Pho Thanh was originally called Pho Phuong Hoang. Even though it was 5 years since my last visit to Arizona, I still remember the restaurant named Pho Phuong Hoang because back then, Pho Phoung Hoang is the BEST pho I ever ate in any state in the United States ever; if I were to Yelp Pho Phuong Hoang, I gave them a Perfect 5/5.   However, this year, when an opportunity allows me to come back to visit Arizona, I swing by your place... I still remembered the Pho Phuong Hoang restaurant, which located nextdoor to that small Vietnamese supermarket in Camelback Road. But, when I saw your restaurant, Pho Phuong Hoang was bankrupt & gone. :(   Instead, a new pho restaurant took over which is called your Pho Thanh.   Of course, I am openminded to give it a try, hoping to see if Pho Thanh is as good as your predecessor: Pho Phuong Hoang.   Unfortunately, after tasting your restaurant Pho Thanh, I'm sorry to say that your pho restaurant is not as good as your predecessor Pho Phuong Hoang did.   Here are my list of pros & cons to why your Pho Thanh only earned a 3 star:   Pros:  -Food is cheap & inexpensive, which is good  -Large variety in your menu to choose from  -Good size proportions for the bowl of pho & Com Tam dishes.  -Timing of the service of the food is good; especially the Com Tam dish came out first before the pho, which is how a good Vietnamese restaurant supposed to be. -Place is more spacious than the original Pho Phuong Hoang   Cons:  -Your pho broth is slightly diluted & start losing the flavor. More details about the pho, the meats are supposed to be sliced not too thin nor too thick--yours is sliced too thin; need to be at least 0.5-1 mm in slicing size. Also needs more cilantro to garnish the pho. In addition, the way Pho Phuong Hoang does it that I gave them a high score is that WITHOUT request, when they serve pho, they also AUTOMATICALLY serve a plate of sliced onions doused in vinegar.  -Com Tam: The meat is slightly dry. Try to baste the meat more while your grilling; this allows the meat to absorb the marinate juice as you're grilling in the heat & it will result the meat to be nice & moist which makes it soft & tender.   Sorry Pho Thanh, I thought you were as good as your predecessor Pho Phuong Hoang, unfortunately not good enough. Though you can catch up to be better than your predecessor by following my suggestions listed in the Pros/Cons section above.   Overall, you earned a 3/5 stars from me. Still have a lot of work to do. Good luck with your business.",

I usually rotate between ordering the following 3 entrees:  -Pho Dac Biet: Beef Broth noodle soup that comes with sliced beef, tendon, beef brisket and meatballs.  -Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong: Cold rice noodle dish served with grilled pork and 2 egg rolls -Com Tam Thanh Dac Biet: It's broken rice that  comes with a grilled pork chop, fried egg, crab-egg cake ground shrimp wrapped in beancurd and beef wrapped in grape leaves. This dish is pretty big. It can probably serve two, but I don't like sharing it.   All portions are generous and the flavors are intense.  Food comes out pretty fast considering they can get really busy. If you're looking for service and ambiance, you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for fast, quality food that's cheap then this is the place for you.  One note, we found out the hard way, they are closed on Tuesdays.",

The steak was cooked to perfection, the broth to meat, to noodle ratio was very good and the large size is more than enough for 2 people. It was hard to stop eating this meal, but i had to or I was going to explode.  The decor is minimal and this place is setup for fast service either dine-in or take home. Pay at the counter when you are finished and grad a togo order on the way out!  Check it out, you would be disappointed.",

Part of the problem with this place is the absolute lack of parking for all of the businesses in this area.    I feel like my deepest road rager tendencies come out when circling like shark in this tiny lot with 12 spaces.  There was one time it was so bad I just gave up and left.  Not my favorite area at night, either, but sometimes I just gotta get my pho fix here!  The banh xeo is pretty tasty, but I would prefer it if they went a little easy on the bean sprouts.  Mine was made perfectly tonight, though.  So yummy!  The pho thai is usually hit or miss here for me.  Hard to compete with my MIL's,though :)  My husband got the cafe sua da (sp?) and he really enjoyed it.  Nice and strong without being overpowering.",

Yes, their service is HORRIBLE, they throw the menus on the table and do not speak or smile but their food is decent (I am speaking as to flavor only). Today for lunch we were extremely DISGUSTED and disappointed. I looked up their number to make sure they were open and I happened to start reading their reviews although like I said, I 've been there before. One of the reviews said \"the restrooms are disgusting I wonder how their kitchen looks.\" That REALLY stuck with me but we were already committed (it was three of us) so off we go! We ordered the usual. Two bites away from finishing my spring rolls I find a thick black hair threaded into the spring roll! Ewww! The fact that it was deep in there and not just lightly sitting on top made it even worse. My friend says \"that's gross. Want mine? Mine is from a different batch. What're the odds? Like one in one thousand!?\" (they had forgotten his spring rolls so they came 10 minutes after mine). I did not accept his offer. He began eating his very carefully! SURPRISE SURPRISE! Half way into his spring roll he finds a LONG BLACK AND THICK hair. I couldn't believe it. What the ___?! Please see the pictures. It makes me regret EVER eating there. I will never be back. I can forgive ONE hair in the food, fine, it happens but TWO?! IN THE SAME MEAL? SAME SEATING? Clearly they don't give  a crap about cleanliness. I REALLY do wonder what their kitchen looks like. I get up show it to the cashier who i believe is the owner and he takes the spring rolls and takes them back to the kitchen. He comes back and says \"sorry 'bout that. Want me to take one roll off you bill?\" I explained to him that it was 2 different orders so he took 2 off. A restaurant who does not take pride in their cleanliness and sanitary issues does not deserve my business. I will never be back.",

The tofu dish tasted like it was cooked in fish sauce, and aside from it not being truly \"vegetarian,\" the tofu was awful and the wheat gluten meat is something you can buy in a can.  The other noodle dish was so bland that we had to add FOUR different sauces to it, just to give it some kind of flavor.

    "text": "Pho  It's pronounced \"/feu/\"...does that help anybody?  Okay...sounds like \"fun\" only without the \"n\", and \"Thanh\" sounds like \"tang\", minus the \"g\".  If you run \"Pho Thanh\" through a translator, it translates as either \"Cheese Bar\" or \"The Streets\"...or, as they say in Ho Chi Minh City (nee Saigon)...\"Cheese Bar\".  I couldn't say what a cheese bar has to do with this delightful little place...I didn't see any cheese on the menu, nor is there anything cheesy about the place...just straight ahead, well made, tasty (and although Dr. Andrew Weill shudders when he hears me say it)...healthy Vietnamese food!  And while I'm on the subject of Dr. Weill...since when did a sweaty 350 pound recluse (with the remains of the entire turkey dinner with all the \"trimmin's\" that he evidently had for breakfast floating around in his beard), become the \"healthy living\" guru for a generation?  I'm puzzled...not that I don't want his lifestyle...I do!  Still, it's a mystery!  There's no mystery at Pho Thanh...just unpronounceable menu selections and great Pho!  I've learned over the years to make my selections either by pointing at the menu and smiling or by saying things like \"I'll have a number 2 and number 38, with a diet Coke, please\".  Back when I was very young and still had my swagger on, I would stroll into one of the great Vietnamese joints in Portland, sit down and say \"Pho Me\"!  So funny!...At least to me.  That phrase led to several misunderstandings, \"incidents\"  and police reports, as well as a lengthy stint of child support payments for little Nguyen Dat S. (although he really looks nothing like me...but I do get a Christmas card from him and his family every year...nice!).  But that's the dimly remembered past!  Yesterday, I met a couple of my buddies in the Mekong Delta (you know, the West Side vortex of great Pho...the triangle between Maxim, Da Vang and Pho Thanh) and we had a great time at lunch!  My buddies are both attorneys, suckling at the supple twin teats of misery and money and the stories they tell at lunch would make most people writhe in despair...but not us...we are made of sterner stuff!  We split an order of Goi Cuon and Cha Gio and dug into our respective bowls of Pho...delicious, delicious Pho ...no question!  All of the standard high quality Pho prep tools are there to perfect your soup...sawtooth herb, basil, bean sprouts, and enough hot chili in several different forms to cause you severe pain the next morning...it lets you know you're alive...important at my age!  This particular Mekong Delta doesn't require a Ghe Nang or a Swift Boat to navigate, just hop on the light rail or risk your life in Camelback traffic and drop on by.  Just don't say \"Pho Me\"...",

The cafe sua da is delicious, but you have to be patient for the coffee to drip down.  If you're looking to test your manliness, challenge yourself with #54.",

    "text": "A small restaurant on the corner with very low prices for the amount of food given, but also at the cost of cleanliness/neatness.  I was seated at a table with the the workers' soda cans, a child's cup, and napkins that weren't cleaned up despite the place not even being close to full.  The gentleman at the register was polite, but my server was anything but.  He plopped the menu on the table and kept sighing whilst leaning on a high chair in between waiting/clearing tables and didn't utter a word to us.  There was a lot of garbage on the floor... some food scraps, napkins, chopstick wrappers, and dirt.  The food was decent overall with generous portions and pretty tasty pho.  The pho was served as I'm used to with a side plate of herbs, bean sprouts, and hot peppers.  The broth is a bit oily and could use a little more depth, but for the price it's good enough.  The spring rolls were alright, the proteins within lacked seasoning, and the sauce was your typical peanut variety which provided them with a pleasant flavor.  Proportionally, however, the spring rolls could use a thinner rice paper wrapper, more greens, and less noodle (in my humble opinion).  Admittedly I was a little put off due to the lack of tidiness which probably has skewed my review in a negative fashion, but cleanliness goes a long way.  I will probably try Pho Thanh again before making my final decision on whether or not it's a place I'd like to frequent... so until then - \"A-OK\" it is.",

    "text": "Went by last night and first thing noticed was how full the parking lot was...good sign that the food must be great.  My hubby isn't a big fan of Asian cuisine, but I encouraged him to at least try it.  He was quite frustrated by the parking lot issues as some of the people were absolutely rude in their parking etiquette (stopping in the driving lane and just parking and being loud and obnoxious while holding up several cars all around)  Once inside and had placed our to go order, we waited for at least 30 minutes for the food, further frustrating my hubby.  Well, needless to say once we got home and he took one nice bite of the egg roll, all of his feelings of frustration were gone.!  He said it was the best egg roll he has ever had here in Phoenix...after trying the Beef Soup with noodles and Won Ton Soup with veggies, I believe he is hooked.  Next time though I will definitely call our order in and pick it up so we don't have to deal with the insanity of the parking lot.",

    "text": "This restaurant deserves 5-stars for its great food, great price (less than $6 for almost all main dishes), and great authentic selections. It's one of the best Vietnamese Restaurants in the Phoenix area.  Broth has so much flavor, good portions for all noddle soup and rice plates, and also have good variety of desserts to choose from.  To me, their service is typical for an Asian restaurant that doesn't overcharge you for good food.  By Western standards, their service is lacking (better if you speak the language).  They do seat you right away even when they are busy, and food comes out fast, but don't expect much more than that.  They do accept all major credit cards.  You can eat a lot for 2 people at this place under $20!",

    "text": "The deal:  - Great pho and other menu items. I had vegetarian pho with tofu that was top-notch.  - CHEAP. I think our entire meal (2 entrees, 1 app, tax+tip) was $13.  - Not very clean, and the staff could use some lessons in this area -- a couple of qualms we had were:  The guy bussing tables doesn't think twice about dousing a table with Windex while customers are eating their meals a few feet away.  Not cool. I imagine this is a bad habit that needs to be remedied, rather than an isolated occurrence.  I personally hate smelling chemicals while I'm eating.  Also, the same guy wheeled around a filthy cart full of customers' dirty dishes, and parked the thing just inches from me while I was eating. He never seems to empty the cart, just continues wheeling it around until it is overflowing with nasty remnants of meals. It was covered in crusty sauce (as if it's never been washed) and contains mounds of discarded food. It just looked gross. I tried ignoring it as it sat an arm's-length from me, but it quashed my appetite to some extent.   Bottom line: I'll likely go back for a cheap, quick Viet meal, and will hope that the minor infractions I pointed out here get resolved.",

I've only been here a handful of times but I've noticed with every visit, I crave it a little more thereafter.  In fact, I'm craving it now and it's only 8 a.m.  I once heard that in Vietnam they actually eat Pho for brunch...  One of the greatest things about Pho Thanh is the build it yourself spring rolls!  It comes with a stack of rice paper, a bowl of water for dipping, a plate of meat and a massive mound of greens, limes and vegetables.  Throw it in, roll it up and dip it in fish or soy sauce, oh so good!  Can't wait to go back!!!",
