    "text": "We decided to stop into Zu Izakaya since we are regulars at Bei their other sister restaurant down the street. We came in on a Friday night and every table had people except the long community table in the center of the restaurant so we were seated there. We wanted to sit on the bar side but it was closed as I'm thinking they had some water/plumbing issue from the looks outside. Not a huge biggie though. I ordered the Coconut Chicken Curry Hot Pot and my boyfriend ordered a roll. The Hot Pot is definitely big enough to share as we even had leftovers. It was flavored well and my boyfriend enjoyed his roll as well. Service was ok but not great.   Not sure if we will be back since we LOVE Bei so much but so glad we tried Zu Izakaya.",

We had the eel and salmon nigiri (which weren't bad), the spicy salmon roll, the rainbow roll, and the caterpillar roll.  They looked appetizing, but the flavor was missing.  Everything just tasted bland and lifeless.  The staff were very friendly and the service was quick, but not worth the effort in my opinion.  That being said, we did not try any of the Korean bbq or main meals, so that may be worth a try based on the other reviews I read.",

    "text": "I was having a stressful work week and feeling completely tense even after it was over. My stomach felt like there was a knot and needed something to be done right away. On my way home, I called up Karen W to see if she had any dinner plan. She said no (WOOO HOOOO!!! happy dance) and that was how we ended up here last night.   As soon as we arrived, a table was already reserved/set up for us. The restaurant is definitely well decorated with dark walls, a wall decorated with many pieces of small mirrors and with lots of beer bottles in the middle of the bar table. I can see this place getting really busy during the weekends for college kids. If you are here with your date, this place could also be relaxing and romantic. Throughout the entire meal, we ordered many skewers and appetizers to share with including (but not limited to) Aghi Tofu, poki bowl, Korean beef, chicken wings, sushi burritos, cheese spam, quail eggs, asparagus, meat balls and finishing up the entire meal with a beautifully decorated Eel dish. My favorite was the poki bowl and the sushi burritos. Both dishes were so refreshing and the rice was just at the right temperature. My second favorite was the Eel dish. The presentation was so good I almost didn't want to eat it. I've always enjoyed inexpensive small bites which allows me to try different variety of food. Everything is tasty except the cheese spam that we ordered. I cannot taste the spam and the only taste that was left in my mouth was the cheese. It was too overpowering for me. If you like cheese, however, this might be it for you.   During dinner, I did see the owner walking around checking up on everyone from a distance at the corner of my eye. I thought that was sweet. I would have given this restaurant a 5 star if it wasn't because our waitress was throwing around an attitude when we first got here. She walked away without taking my friend's order. Instead of apologizing, she walked back with an attitude showing us know that she was annoyed. I wasn't very happy with that. However, her attitude did improve towards the end of the night and did check up on us often. I do appreciate her attitude adjustment.  If you are a fan of Korean/Japanese food as well as soju and sake, this is the place to be. I did see some happy hour menu with reasonable prices. We ate so much and the total only comes to $75 including tax. I will most definitely come back here again to try something else. Thank you Karen W and Zu Lazkaya for making my night better. I walked away happy towards the end of the night.",

You can't go wrong with the hot pots either and if the price is intimidating, don't worry, it's big enough to share with 2-3 people (depending on which one you get) and you can fill in the rest of your hunger with their skewer options.  My favorites are the asparagus, mushroom, and zucchini.  That bbq sauce they drizzle on is heavenly. I even poured what was left on the plate over my white rice. Oh, and for someone (like me) who orders veggie tempura for the sweet potatoes, rejoice! - they have it as an order all by itself. Perfect. Poke salad was good too, a bit too much rice...but taste was on point. Highly recommend if you're looking for a great modern, Japanese/Korean fusion restaurant!",

I order Alfredo udon every time, along with meatball skewers. They have Japanese beers like Asahi, Orion and Sapporo, which I prefer more than American beers. The food is not too salty or strong so even if you don't drink, the dishes could serve as a great meal. Sammy is our server every time we dine in and she's amazing! Perfect for night outs and late night gatherings.",

We arrived for the dinner time happy hour, and ordered gyoza, a couple beers, spicy tuna roll, and the jalapeno/spicy Las Vegas roll. I was really happy with all! The gyoza is fresh and tasty! And sushi tasted fresh and delicious. The spicy tuna roll could have been a little spicier but that's why we got Sriracha and wasabi. We Weill definitely be coming back for more sushi and to try out some of their entree which looked amazing! Can't wait to try the Hotpot especially :)",

My husband's soup (curry) came out in about 15 minutes, but it was another 15 minutes before mine (tamago/unagi bowl) arrived. The rice was undercooked and they brought me another bowl of plain rice, then I had to transfer the food over myself. The eel sauce was so overwhelming, I couldn't distinguish between the egg and the eel. While waiting for my bowl, they tried to serve us other orders four different times! We watched them try several tables before finding the correct table. The hamachi negi roll was rolled so loosely that it could not be picked up by hand nor chopstick without falling completely apart. Sorry, but it's back to Kabuki for us.",

We had the shrimp tempura appetizer which was okay.  We also had a tempura appetizer in a sweet sauce that was very good.  For dinner, we had the pork goyuza hot pot with udon noodles and the Oden hot pot.  One hot pot would probably be enough for two people if you had an appetizer - they are large portions.  My wife thought the pork goyuza was okay but not wonderful, I thought the Oden was terrific.  The broth had a wonderful black pepper spiciness to it and it was very flavorful (umami).  We will probably try here again - it seems just a matter of finding the dishes that they excel at - such as the Oden hot pot.",

He mentioned that he just didn't feel it was needed. It was perfect. Not to say it was salty, it wasn't. It was just perfectly seasoned broth.  I had the White Peach Sake and my husband had Asahi beer. Both very good.  The service was actually excellent. The waiter was there when we needed him, but didn't hover. We couldn't have asked for better.  I think we have to go back here before leaving this time, and when we visit again!",

My favorite was the skewers. Tender, grilled, and flavorful. Again the sushi was ok and the gyoza was over fried. We also had some slow service and the restraunt was so hot inside. Mind you we went at dinner time on a Friday night, but it wasn't very busy so better service was expected (aka more than one server).",

The only recommendation for the cook is to use a little less salt in some of the food! Also I think the green tea should come included in your experience (reg. 2.95)  The Owner of BEI created this place and was very friendly as were the other staff!

She was able to give us a table of 6 and take my reservation. We sat down and started off w blueberry soju, the garlic chili edamame, gyoza and the cheese spam katsu. Did I tell you they have happy hour till 7pm even on weekends?? U know most restaurants don't offer happy hour on weekends. So a lot of the appetizers we ordered was on the happy hour menu. The garlic chili edamame was amazing!! And the cheese spam katsu was very tasty as well!! There were three pieces which we all shared. It brought me back to my childhood days. For my main entree, I was torn w so many of the amazing options... did I want sushi, or grilled Korean BBQ, or the many choices of hot pots?? I ended up going w the spicy kimchi hot pot which had spam, mushroom, pork and ramen. It was really good but quite the portion. It's meant to be shared so of course I couldn't finish it. I had the left overs for lunch today! Yum!! I'll definitely be coming back to try the other hot pots and dishes!!",

I spat most of it out into a napkin as the smell and taste were nauseating. I'm a coward because I couldn't tell them this to their desperately hopeful faces.

We were asked if we would like to sit in the restaurant area or go to the bar area ( a separate room that you have to walk out and around the corner to) and enjoy happy hour pricing. We agreed to sit at the bar and were told to head outside and go in the bar. When we walked in, there was literally one seat available and there were two of us. We ended up sitting outside, which wasn't bad because the weather was unusually nice. We sat around for at least 10-15 min and had no one come out to take our order so I thought we might have to order from the bar. As I walked in to ask, the very flustered bar tender said she'd be right out. She was and we ordered drinks and food and everything was fine after that. They should really have some kind of system in place to let the front of the house know when there is no longer anymore room in the car to seat people, as well as arrange for more help in the bar area as well, as it seemed to be pretty busy, while the restaurant area was dead and their servers were practically hanging out in there.. other than that, food and drinks are great and reasonably priced.",

    "text": "Zu Izakaya is a bit of a mixed bag.  The food quality is good.  The service is great.  The atmosphere has a young, upscale-ish flare with a vibe you'd find in Asia. But FOREWARNING: their portion sizes were Falsely advertised and made me wish I had ordered something different.  In my honest opinion, False advertising goes a long way in overall customer satisfaction, irregardless of the service and quality of food.  I ordered the Poke Bowl with salmon, and on the taste front, it delivered all around.  It offers a wide variety of ingredients and flavors (in addition to the rice and the salmon) as picture below.  BUT, if you look at Zu Izakaya's business-uploaded picture of the salmon Poke Bowl on the menu and website (you can even find it here on Yelp!)...it looks like there's a TON of salmon in the bowl.  Either those are some really large salmon chunks, or half that bowl is covered in salmon (oh, photography can really work wonders). And compare that to how this dish actually plays out in my picture below.  I was dumbfounded at how little salmon I actually got. I saw the pictures on the menu and thought, \"damn, that's a lot of salmon and rice!  That's exactly what I need today.  This is great!\" only to be disappointed in person.  If they stripped EVERYTHING off that bowl and just left half rice and half salmon and charged me double the price, I would've been much happier than what I receive here.  The service though was great.  Two of my friends at the table had a flight to catch later that night and didn't want to check a bag just for a bottle of champagne they were planning to take with them (engagements for the win!), so our server VERY generously allowed us to open the bottle of champagne at our table for no charge.  She even provided cups for us to use.  Great customer service goes a long way and will likely be the factor for my return.  My rating is probably harsh and as you can tell, I'm extremely bitter about getting less fish than advertised, even though the food quality was great.  But there's something...uneasy about businesses that have to manipulate their business photos to get a result that does not reflect reality.  Fortunately, it is not a direct reflection of the restaurant itself which is everything but.  When I return to AZ again next year, I'll update my review accordingly once I've tried other menu offerings and have more of an \"objective\" experience.",

Edamame was very good.  Calamari came in big strips like chicken strips but was meaty and the breading wasn't too overwhelming.  Great sauce with it too!  Our entrees were a seafood hot pot and the ahi poke salad.  Both great flavors and very fresh. The hotpot was jammed full of yummy seafood.  Prices reasonable too.  Service perfect.  I'll be going back to try other things.  Can't wait!!",

Udon was very delicious especially after a long day of work (got an add of chicken that was worth it). Beer prices are reasonable and it's right across the street. I'm coming back for sure. FYI looks like Asian fusion with the fusion being mostly Korean.",

Our server was nice and let us order off happy hour menu because we walked in when it was ending.  We had 5 sorts of skewers: pork, chicken, meatball, steak and sausage. My favorites were the pork and chicken, perfectly cooked and seasoned. Other items we ordered was steamed egg, spam and cheese katsu, bulgogi tacos, kimchi tacos and spicy pork. We enjoyed just about all of them, especially the tacos. Again I was hesitant because I figured they would have been soft corn tortillas or so, but they were hard shell. First bite and I was hooked, the shell was light and crisp, it complimented the contents. Kimchi tacos were surprisingly good with the guacamole too. The fresh kimchi was great as well because it was spicy!   I am definitely coming back. I have been to a similar concept in Tempe, but I didn't feel compelled to go home and immediately write a review like this place (and that was over a year ago). Hopefully they will add more exciting options to the skewer list!",

Some of the appetizers were a hit or miss: The meat balls were fantastic but the things like the mushrooms or the scallops fall flat in terms of size and quantity. The best thing I saw there was the Muscle Hot Pot a friend of mine ordered. You get plenty of muscles and the broth is pretty good. The menu is pretty diverse and features a lot of different asian food from all countries.",

Location is random.   We ordered the Jjambbong hot pot and Las Vegas roll. Add additional edamame with checking in on Instagram.  With regards to the hot pot, price is around 16.95 and it comes with a side of rice and Raman in the hot pot. Ramen noodle is not that much, but the rice makes up for it. The Hot Pot also included some mushroom, shrimp, scallops, black mussels, clams, vegetables, pork. Soup broth tastes like shin Ramen with maybe some miso. Not spicy at all. You will get thirsty from the sodium. Decent amount of clams and mussels. Serving is probably for 1 person. But i did share the dish and still was full. They do have a variety of other hot pot styles. Probably better to come here on a cold winter day. Pricing is usually around $15 for the other hot pots.   With regards to the Las Vegas roll, they have happy hour at 4 to 7 p.m. and every day at 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. everyday. Edamame will cost around 2.5 dollars. Edamame was fresh and steam and hot and not cold. right amount of salt. Essentially, basic good edamame.  Las Vegas roll during happy hours around 6.95. Pretty decent with the Las Vegas roll definitely more cream cheese in the roll. Would order again during happy hour.  Environment is pretty clean. Server is friendly and attentive.   More to explore on the menu, as they have tacos, skewers, and other signature dishes. They also serve char-grill meets in a bowl of rice. Korean Style.  With regards to the Mochi ice cream,which was obtain after Yelp review. Not too sweet. Just the way I like it. But could use more mochi covering.",

We walked into the diner room and stared at the waiter watching all of them and weren't acknowledged for 10-12 minutes. It was awkward and we were honestly ready to walk out.  When we finally approached the waitress asked if a reservation had been made. We said no and she asked for a moment to get the table ready.  Few moments later we shown to our table and surprisingly happily with the quality of the food. The rolls were great and served in a timely manner. The butter corn was a little oily and the utensil choice was odd but we managed.  Every couple moments we were asked if needed anything and water cup was filled frequently. I give them a 4 because I will definitely come in again. But my tip would be to make a reservation.  Hopefully next time they notice when people are waiting.  Oh and thank you for our free mochi for this review.",

The good:   They have some really interesting sushi rolls.  They use FRESH WASABI on many rolls and I love fresh wasabi.  (I always thought I hated wasabi because I only ever had the paste.  Fresh is so different.)   The bad:  My \"naughty lemonade\" was more on the side of a cheerleader with herpes.  It was alcoholic, sweet and...  yeah, that's pretty much it.   Some of the fish had a bit of an odor to it and didn't taste terribly fresh.    With fresher fish and better sochu cocktails, I think this place could be visit-worthy again.  As it stands, not so much.",

For the entree we got the Galbi and another dosh (i forgot the name but theres a picture of it on the menu). The Galbi was absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked. The other dish was good, but not quite as tasty. Our server was very attentive and service was timely.   I found the appetizers to have been both beautiful and tasty, but a tad pricey! A entree is about 13 dollars while the appetizer we ordered was about 9. The fried thing that was featured on the menu felt like a common cheap orange chicken type dish, but they seemed to be aware if this and supplied much more of it. The other dish was of much high quality!",

It was all just very reactive, not proactive. I felt like we were almost an annoyance to our server, one of our rolls was the wrong kind/not what we ordered and she didn't apologize or anything, our waters never got refilled. It was even hard to decide what to order because nothing sounded that good or jumped out at me. I just didn't feel that the menu was very cohesive. There were a few pros - the sake selection was great and seemed to be a good value. I also really liked the tempura veggies and would recommend those. Bottom line, I was really excited to try this place because we love B.e.i. (I think these are the same owners) but sadly we were pretty disappointed and won't be back here.",

I knew I have walked into a trap. It's Korean, not Japanese. Decided to check it out anyway, for the chance that it had good Korean food. Decor was not izakaya or Korean, more like contemporary. I didn't mind it. There was one waitress, poor thing was running around by herself on a Saturday night. I can tell they are expecting a big crowd... Looked at the menu, ordered the Korean fried chicken. Portion size was appropriate. Price was around $15 per dish. It was way more saucy than needed. Fried too soft. Flavor was ok. Also had the octopus wth ponzu sauce, which was not great flavor, but seemed somewhat fresh. Got the Alfredo seafood pasta. Very bland, like milk but less flavor. My friend said that's how Korean Alfredo is done in Korea, so I can't blame them; just not to my liking. Overall a 6.5/10. I would not go back again though. There are definitely better Korean food for the money. I suggest they pick either Korean or Japanese and stick to it.",

I love that it is so unique and it has food on there you can't get anywhere else in the valley. Kimchi and bulgogi tacos? Yes please!

I also highly recommend the vegetarian rolls, a wonderfully tasteful dish full of zest and pickled veggies. I believe I've found myself a new favorite here in the valley!",

I came here specifically to try the sushi so I asked if they had anything special in and the lady at the bar just looked at me confused. She said she would go ask the chef and came back with a \"the tuna is good\". So I ordered the tuna and a salmon roll. I have had better tuna from Frys... it was very dry and flavorless. And the salmon roll was pretty bland, not very well made. I'm kind of stingy about sushi so maybe it's my point of view, or maybe it was an off night. But not a great experience for me...",

Hearty, with a good broth - The hamachi wasabi had that buttery hamachi flavor with a nice kick to it - The saba was the best I've had in a long time.  Fishy, but not overpowering - The unagi was delicious and sweet as usual - The spicy tuna with garlic roll (fresh broiled garlic) was garlicky.  That's a good thing - The spicy edamame was delicious. Hard to go wrong with that sauce - The sriracha shrimp was good, but probably a touch too much sriracha - Dessert was meh (mochi ice cream), but that's kind of expected at a Japanese restaurant  - Service is a little slow, but the place was packed so that is to be expected - Very cool space.  Most of the good sushi joints in the Valley are pretty spartan.  Not Zu and I appreciated that",

Marinated Galbi Zu Poke bowl  Other Sides: Mirin Mackerel - simple but very nicely prepared Cheese Spam Katsu Spam fries  Mochi Ice Cream  Overall a great meal, with really good food and at a price point that seemed very reasonable. The complimentary mochi ice cream with a Yelp review was the perfect finishing touch. We all left very, very happy and full.",

    "text": "I've been craving sushi for like a whole month and finally my fiance and I decided to go in search of some today. We've driven by this location so many times -- it's really not far from where I work! When we parked, even just outside the restaurant you could smell the kitchen cooking food and it smelled so good! So we walk in and are seated, and there were LOTS of different options on their menu for rolls. We ordered the egg rolls and crab cakes to start, and my fiance immediately picked out the angry caterpillar roll to try. After some serious soul searching, I came to the conclusion that I would choose the baked scallop roll. First of all, EVERYTHING tasted absolutely fantastic. I preferred the angry caterpillar to the baked scallop, but I still recommend everything we had because it was just so delicious! Also the service was very attentive -- they were quick to fill my fiance's water when he was out (and he really appreciated that) but they were also extremely nice. We definitely plan to come back.",

If you enjoy a kick of spice, order the tuna carpaccio. The chili shrimp was also great. Skip the mochi.

However, service was still slow because one employee was the hostess, waitress, and busboy at one point while two other employees stood around. It got better later on.  We checked in on Yelp and got a free edamame appetizer!  This place has nice Japanese decor, very dim lighting, popular American pop music, and a menu filled with tapa-style items. My SO and I ordered a ton of food!  The food and overall here deserves a solid 4.5 stars.  Let's talk about each dish individually: 1. chicken grilled skewers-delicious teriyaki flavors and each order is one skewer. Chicken was moist and not dried out. I can see why this is a popular dish here. 2. chicken wing (2 pc per order)- bland flavor and only grill marks on the end of the wings. Quite terrible actually. 3. shishito pepper (4 pc shishito peppers and togorashi powder)-some pieces spicy were spicy but had char grilled flavors with a sweet sauce drizzled on top. My SO loved this dish.  4. u-10 scallop-dish comes with 3 medium-ish scallops and some iceberg lettuce with spicy mayo on top of it. Cooked to perfection and lettuce was more of a plate-filler. 5. salmon pico de gallo roll-spicy fresh great combo. salmon pieces on top and pico de gallo and spicy tuna filling with avocado and cucumber, topped with spicy aioli. This was super unique and I would order it again. 6. calamari-tempura batter served with spicy mayo sauce. This was delicious but filling due to the heavier tempura-like crust as compared to a lighter cornstarch.",

They have a great Happy Hour with several food selections/appetizers that we made to most of. There main menu is priced ok, somewhat higher than other places I've dined at, but I'm not holding that against them. We had Agedashi Tofu, Gyoza, Cheese & Spam Katsu, Panko Crab Cakes, Salmon Cheek Kalma, Ebi (Shrimp) Honey Mayo, Neoniani Steak Skewer & Meatball Skewer and for the main course, we shared a beef short rib galbi. Everything was well seasoned and had distinctive flavors.  Definitely would go back for more good food.  Give this place a try...Great evening with an old grade school friend.",

    "text": "Stopped into Zu to meet a friend for a small bite, at the interesting time between lunch and dinner. The restaurant was particularly empty considering it was Happy Hour.  Zu carries skewers, rice bowls, hot pots and of course alcohol. Was originally going to get a few skewers, the Poke Bowl caught my eye. Of course, when I think of Poke Bowls I'm used to in California it's typically a bowl of rice topped with marinated cuts of raw fish, fish eggs (masago or tobiko), ginger, scallions, seaweed strips or furikake (seaweed seasoning). The described Poke Bowl looked good, with descriptions of sauce and a choosing of Tuna or Salmon- I chose the latter. The bowl came out pretty quickly but was a marinated, saucy bowl of Salmon on top of hot white rice. The salmon tasted fresh, was soft and the sauce was savory, sweet and of course salty. The salmon was topped with seaweed strips. The only con for me was the price point for the portion. The bowl was about $10. Typically, Poke places will serve Poke bowls fast-casual/Chipotle style for about the same price. I believe if they added more toppings like fish eggs or even avocado it would make this bowl well worth the price.  The service was great. Place was very comfortable to sit and talk without feeling pressured to leave. However, the lock on one of the stalls in the female bathroom does not work. Parking is ample and the restaurant is conveniently located on the corner of North Scottsdale Road and Papago Drive.  Would like to come back to try their hot pots or skewers! ** Free hot sake when you order a hot pot here when you check-in on Yelp",

We ordered a few of the steak kabobs and crab cakes to start off with. First of all, the kabobs are not kabobs at all-- it was literally a hamburger patty with teriyaki sauce on top. The crab cakes were mostly fried batter which I guess is understandable since they were cheap.  I got the udon noodle bowl. The server told me it was white meat chicken and the very few pieces of chicken I did have were dark meat. Unlike the description it did not have veggies, only tons and tons of onions and noodles. My boyfriend got some kind of spicy chicken dish. The chicken was fried dark meat and came with a side of white rice. The entrees were about $15 each.  This place is located so close to me that I was hoping it would be good. We won't be coming back. Definitely a place to pass on! There are plenty of other restaurants in the area.",

As for food I ordered a beef and mushroom hot pot, which came in a mini cauldron. The broth was soul warming and the beef was good. I liked the enoki mushroom and the noodles too. I tried a bit of the poke and tuna tartare and they were both refreshing. I heard the korean hotpot was also really good.

Love the casual feel, great service, and prices were very reasonable. Even more amazing happy hour and reverse happy hour specials.   Favorite thing ordered was the Las Vegas Roll. My husband loved his spicy garlic tuna roll and my shrimp tempura roll was also great. The chili garlic edamame was quite spicy but yummy. Veggie egg rolls and crispy shrimp with mayo sauce also hit the spot.    So much to try! Can't wait to return. Next time I want to try a hot pot or soup. I also want to at least peep my head in to check out their separate bar area.",

There was no hostess or server on the floor so my girlfriend and I sat ourselves at the closest booth - at least 10 empty tables and the middle table were completely empty - we thought we'd be helping the hostess by sitting ourselves. The server walked out shortly and aggressively said, \"there's a sign that says wait to be seated!\" We apologized and said there was no hostess and the place was empty and she said \"for the future, you need to wait to be seated\" with a bitchy tone.   We left because who in their right mind says that when the restaurant is empty. If the owner heard a server say this, she would be fired.   When we left, my girlfriend told her that her aggressiveness was pure insanity. A restaurant like this can't afford to act like a dumbass with customers. It's a shame a young, immature, inexperienced server has the audacity to behave that way with the people that keep them open. Won't be back!",

The Nagasaki seafood hot pot was large enough to be shared between the four of us.  With a rich Tonkotsu broth, tender scallops, clams, mussels  and shrimp the only improvement would be additional ramen as the broth was a bit too salty without that balance.  It was accompanied by a bowl of rice.  The bulgogi was smoky and perfectly grilled.  The coating (not breading as sometimes seems to be the case) on the tempura vegetable was so thin, light, and crispy it shatters between your teeth and flavorful enough I didn't even  need the dipping sauce.  Fantastic.  Besides excellent food, good service and a relaxing ambience (Nora Jones playing in the background) they're open for late night cravings til 1 am every night except Sundays.",

Luckily, this place has a happy hour at 9p and it was just down the street!   I enjoyed the avocado Roll (not on the hh menu, but still a decent price) and the chicken skewers. I also got a free order of egg rolls after tagging them in an Instagram post. But our favorite of the evening was definitely the Las Vegas Roll because it was deep fried. Major win.   The only disappointment was the sushi burrito. It's just better to get one at at a place that specializes in them and let's you load them up with all the awesome stuff you want.   Service was fine. We would definitely hit this place up next time we're in town.",

    "text": "I have fond memories of this particular location because it used to house a delight restaurant called Lo Cascio.  We dined at Lo Cascio for decades. Therefore, we were excited to sample the offerings of the restaurant that had taken its place. Would it be just as good, or would it be just passable.  The verdict is still out, and it will most likely require a return visit.  We came here on a Friday Night, and the place was nearly packed. The decor has certainly been updated to modern standards, and looked quite inviting and elegant. It definitely departed from the conventional layout that the former occupants.  We wanted to give this place an honest try on our first visit, so we ordered a sampling of various dishes that would provide us the breadth of their offerings.   For starters, we ordered the California & Cucumber Sushi Roll.s This is a typical standard fare that is offered by many restaurants, and should provide us with a good introduction.  Unfortunately, I am not sure what happened this evening, but the rolls were very dry. They were so dry that it left a definitive sandy texture in our mouths.   Next up was the Gyoza. We have had this in many ways, and prefer the steamed version. However, the fried version works just as well. Except in this particular instance, it was completely overdone. The wrapper was burned on the edges, and to top it all off; the meat in the interior didn't cook all the way through. Therefore, it tasted under cooked.  After the initial fails, the rest of our meals were quite palatable. The Udon was juicy and delicately spiced. Just the perfect temperature for a cold evening, such as we were having this particular evening.  The Chicken Skewer and the Korean Spicy Sweet and Sour Chicken provided delightfully distinct flavors for the main repast. The Chicken Skewers were lathered in an amazing semi-sweet sauce that just enlivened our palates.  Along with the prompt and attentive service, our overall experience was good - but it wasn't great. The opening salvo of fails was disheartening, but in the end; it proved to be an adequate dining experience.  We will have to give this place another try, at a different time to see how consistent they are in their meal preparation and presentation.",

I was very tired, very hungry, and in the mood for a sake bomb and some delicious hot food. I was immediately greeted by my lovely server, Min. She was amazing and service was lightning fast! She was extremely personable as was the rest of the staff. They had some entertaining movies on the screen and another server came over and discussed the Ip Man movie with me. Very great experience after a full day! I had the Chicken grill and it was very satisfying, yet not heavy. I highly recommend. Thank you, Min and staff.",

Food overall 4 stars - Skewers: both chicken and pork are juicy and tender and very flavorful. - Octopus in ponzu sauce: the flavor in the sauce is well balanced.  - Jjambbong hot pot:  it's hard not to compare with the authentic hot pot I had in California... The soup tasted like the ramen package seasoning and little diluted for my liking. Probably would taste really good if you come in hungry late night lol  Services and environment 5 stars - Nice atmosphere and very attentive services! I would definitely recommend for groups and pre-game LOL",

The chicken skewers were reminiscent of Japan'd Izakayas--very tasty and smokey. The crab cakes are similar to Japanese croquette--also very good.  The tacos were pretty basic...the shells were straight from a box.  The agedashi tofu was also pretty average. I would recommend cooks to go easy with the salt. Overall, there aren't very many places like this in Phoenix so I give it 3 stars.  This is a cheaper version of Sumomaya.   Ambiance/Service: Excellent and modern presentation. Open late night and reverse happy hour has some good deals. The service was prompt and friendly.   Overall impression: The food is definitely aimed at the American palate. Really cool atmosphere though. I would go back to try the hot pots.",

The server greeted us with smile, he escorted us to our table, then he asked if we would like something to drink but didn't rush us to order the food. My friend has been here before but it was my first time!  After we looked at the menu, we decided to order; Las Vegas Roll, Rolled Egg, Poke Bowl (Tuna), Kkanpungi and a special Sea Urchin Sushi ($8.95 for 2 pieces, das expensive!) Lol  Las Vegas Roll came first, we were so hungry and I didn't have a chance to take a picture, it was so... delicious. That's all I can say about this roll.  Poke Bowl came not long after that, we tried it out and it was good. I didn't eat this one too much, okay I know this is weird, I eat tuna sushi just fine because the tuna is wrapped inside of the sushi but when I looked at the Poke Bowl with all those red looking tuna on top of it, I couldn't help it. Lol  Rolled Egg came after that, the food just kept coming man, lol. But this one, not only it smelled so good, it tasted so yummy!  Kkanpungi, this was our FAVORITE dish from this place. It was sweet and spicy, omg I can snack on this everyday! And the portion is perfect for 2 people.  Finally, Sea Urchin sushi... I honestly didn't know what sea urchin is until I googled it. I thought they would serve me the whole sea urchin LOL and my friend told me No! Just the inside of it. I was like, oh boy, I can tell that I won't like it already. I looked at the sushi, I said it's $8.95 for 2pcs, you'd better work... My friend tried it first, he said hmm, it's okay, I had a better one. I poked the yellow thing with my chopstick, shit it looks chewy, I don't trust this. So my friend said let's cut into a small piece and you try it, if you don't like it, I'll eat the rest. I took the small piece, I literally prayed before I ate it LMAO and well... My prayer didn't work, it tasted so TERRIBLE, I almost puked. It tasted so weird, it's slimy and kinda bitter, I felt like eating mucus. MY GOD, Ok I'll stop.  I love this place, for real though. I want to try their other menu, specially the sushi. But, sea urchin, never again. But if you're curious, give it a try. Lol",

I was a little worried at first since you never know how busy a restaurant will be on a Friday, but we were able to get a table for the four of us within 10 minutes of walking through the door. It might've been shorter than that.  This place offers a robust menu. There are dozens of appetizers, sushi roll choices, and hot plates. For those of you looking to get drinks with your food, the sake and beer options are also very vast.   I had gotten a Tempura Roll to start and then the Bulgogi plate for dinner. The serving sizes for both weren't as big as I was expecting, but the flavor over all was very good. The sushi tasted fresh and the bulgogi was satisfying. (Perhaps a little dry in comparison to a AYCE KBBQ place but still good.)  Overall, we had a fun time here. I would probably come back :)",

Plenty of discounts on both food and beverage, my Yelp check in yielded us a warm portion of edamame for free.   Lots of food was ordered including a Beef Hot Pot, That hot pot was pretty amazing and is now on my radar for when I return. Steamy broth with glass noodles and the most savory onion and beef broth I have ever had. This was top notch and completely cravable. Interesting skewers are on the HH list including meatball, chicken wing, lil smokies and a more conventional beef. all were tasty. Mozzarella sticks??? yep out of place on this menu but it's America, and we are adults so why not. These got high marks though it appears the breading has changes since the last time.  Some places make a good California Roll some do not! This was  Zu's short coming but for 4 bucks during happy hour it was all most expected. Filled full with Krab Salad and a sliver of cucumber, and not even a hint of avocado. Spicy tuna was similar, yet better and the yellow tail was as good as any in town.  My buddies were familiar with our server as she was with them. I must say service was just fine throughout our long visit at Zu.  This is one of the coolest and most hip restaurants in the area, I know, I live on Fillmore St. So give it a try and make it a new regular hang out spot like I am about to.",

This restaurant is split in to two areas where the main dining area is in the front and if you walk outside the bar area is in the back. We were greeted by a kind bartender named Kevin who was so kind to inform us of their amazing happy hour deals. The deals consisted of discounted cocktails, beers, sake, sushi rolls, bowls, bulgogi, and more. The happy hour prices were extremely affordable and covered a lot. I ended up ordering their plum sake and steak bulgogi. The plum sake was sweet, fruity, and a little candy like but still pleasant at the same time.  The steak bulgogi with peppers was a nice portion and very flavorful. It also came with a small bowl of steamed white rice that I enjoyed as well.",

The sashimi poke is awesome but I did not wanna eat starch for dinner so it was provided without rice. They are decent fresh on the condition of living far from the ocean. I wanna try the oysters but they were not on the menu. My friends told me she loved the skewers and I'm just fine with their chicken & sausage skewers. Their edamame cooks good, as good as Japanese chef.  No alcohol for me. I love them but harmful for health. The hot green tea taste super good. Korean Japanese and Chinese are all good at tea! Their restroom, I only could check the male one... it's clean enough. But you know it really depends on customers' dignity. Finally, love it! The services are also top notch.",

The garlic edamame was absolutely the best I've had. They even had garlic roasted skewers which are surprisingly very delicious if you mix it with maybe a pork skewer or chicken. There's so many ways to mix and match them. Such a good appetizer or possibly just a meal for everyone to share.  My fiance is a very picky man and has not taken me out for sushi because he doesn't like fish. But the fact that this restaurant has so much options and great ones at that, makes it a place for everyone to enjoy.  The service from Danny was amazing. Very attentive never felt like we are waiting for anything. Very funny and personable server.   I HIGHLY recommend coming here for a great delicious  dinner, an unforgettable one at that!",

It has a great atmosphere but terrible choice of modern pop music (every sad Kygo song).  The food was okay, not expecting anything amazing but it wasnt underwhelming either. Our waiter was really nice but wasnt the brightest when it came to questions about modifying dishes. For instance, one of our party members asked to replace the rice with salad for their chicken dish, to which he replied there would be a $2 upcharge. For switching Rice to Salad, in the dish. I'm sure it wasnt his fault but still that's pretty ridiculous. It also irked me that they had \"Give us a Yelp review and get a free dessert\", places that do that tend to have overinflated Yelp ratings.  Overall 3/5",

    "text": "Do not order pick-up from here, especially if you're viewing their menu online. I'm not from the area and was staying near this restaurant. I called for a pick-up to order based off of the menu on their website. There was a particular item that according to the person on the phone, they don't have anymore. He kept asking what I wanted and I said that I cannot determine that if the menu is not accurate. I asked him if I could just read the description and they could make it, and he said \"No, no. What do you want?\" I then asked if they had anything similar to that particular roll, which he again repeated that they do not. He kept asking what I wanted and said he was the owner and he was \"so sorry\" that the menu was not correct. I said respectfully that if he's the owner, he should make sure that the menu online is completely accurate and if items change, that they should be removed or added. It had been a long day and I just wanted to go in and pick up the order, not go in, look at a menu and then sit and wait. He became very combative and continuously asked what I wanted, and I kept repeating that if the menu is showing items they don't have, how could I order? I asked him where to look at an accurate menu and he said \"On our website.\" THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE I WAS LOOKING AND HE TOLD ME PRIOR THAT IT THEY OFTEN HAVE ITEMS THAT CHANGE!! It was a very back and forth conversation for a minute. I told him thank you and hung up, so they lost an order that night. The \"owner\" according to the man on the phone, made no effort to help or rectify the situation or even say that he would make sure the menu was updated online. He just kept repeating himself and becoming more and more aggressive. It was a very odd conversation, so be careful if you order pick-up. This is not the way to run a restaurant or treat a customer. If your menu changes, you update it. It's that simple. Their online menu is NOT accurate.",

For entres we got the beef bulgogi and Kkanpungi (Korean-style fried chicken with sweet-spicy marinade). The beef bulgogi came out on a sizzling plate which made us even more excited for it. The beef was very tender and flavorful and the veggies were really good with it too. The Kkanpungi was something I had never had before, but can't wait to have it again. The chicken stayed tender and moist on the inside while it stayed crunchy on the outside. The sauce was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. They also have really good rice--I've been to so many Asian restaurants where the entree is great, but they skimp on the rice so I appreciated the really good bowl of rice from here. We saw a waiter walking by with a hot pot--it looked more like a cauldron(it was so big). We're looking forward to trying a hot pot next.  We told our waiter that it was our first time here and she brought us out a green tea mochi ice cream for dessert, just to say thanks for being a first time customer. It's the little things like that that just make me love a place even more.",

It's sad to see a restaurant my husband grew up attending vanish, but I am glad that the building is still here and that such a nice restaurant moved in. The inside has been refurbished to look very elegant and comfortable. Also, the soy sauce containers have adorable cats on them. Obviously a sign of a quality restaurant.   We visited during happy hour and ordered a couple rolls from the happy hour menu. A little more variety on the happy hour menu would be nice, but the rolls were tasty. The spicy salmon was a little spicier than I prefer spicy salmon to be. I didn't try the non-sushi options, which make up a large part of their menu, but I might try them sometime if I am in the area again.",

We had a couple of main dishes but hands down the Bulgogi Mushroom Hot Pot was exceptional!  It is now one of my favorite dishes EVER!! We also had a signature dish called Tofu Kimchi which was fabulous as well. Lots of people around us were having sushi as well and it looked good but we didn't have room for sushi.

Spicy tuna roll, naughty lemonade, and pork galbi dish were great. My favorite of course was the main dish (grilled meat + rice, can't go wrong). The sake was good, but I thought the 'naughty lemonade' was a cocktail so I couldn't finish my sake alone. The spicy tuna was a little on the salty side, so it tasted better without the soy sauce. The pork was wonderful, I was split between that and the bulgogi. I think I made a great decision either way. I would have loved to try the hot pot too but I was quite full after the items I ordered. I would definitely come back with friends next time I'm in the area! Seems like a great restaurant for larger groups.",

I liked the gyoza and sushi but was not so excited about the hot pot. I've had hot pot and made a version myself and loved it.  The liquid had an odd taste to me and I wish the restaurant had Korean sauces to offer because it was bland. Also, there was only one employee serving the whole bar so service was friendly but slow.

Then we wandered through a zesty squid salad and fresh seaweed salad, both were terrific. We loved the crispy gyoza dumplings, the incredibly flavorful tuna tartare, and the udon noodles flavored with zucchini and beef, and finally the spicy fried chicken. Every single dish was perfectly prepared, delivered graciously, and so so good. I cannot wait to get back here and try a few more items on the menu.

Very friendly staff and the interior redesign/redecorate is comfortable and relaxing.  Tried a small bottle of sake which was very good - I've not been exposed to this too much so it was interesting to try - they have a decent selection and bottles are 50% off during happy hour.  They serve a variety of small dishes - I had the quail eggs which were so tasty and a chicken skewer dish and edamame both of which were also very good.  I finished up with the squid legs which were fine, but probably won't have them again. Overall a very enjoyable experience with interesting food options and a relaxed and friendly ambience.",

    "text": "Honestly I'm surprised by all of the good reviews for this place. My bf and I decided to give this a place a try since it's fairly new to the neighborhood, and it was the most bizarre dining experience that either one of us have ever had. Our server was nice.... But the menu... I shudder a little just thinking about it. It had everything on it from a quesadilla to ketchup covered spam. Not being totally scared off after viewing the menu, we decided to order several things to give it a try. We ordered some steak kabobs and chicken skewers to start. The steak kabob was neither a steak nor a kabob. What was brought to us was a hamburger patty covered in what appeared to be teriyaki sauce with a little wooden fork stuck in the middle. Again, it was a hamburger patty.... and didn't taste like a very good quality one either. Feeling adventurous we pressed on and tried the chicken skewers. These didn't taste bad, but were definitely the gristly parts of a chicken that you wouldn't normally want to eat. Unfortunately we had already put in an order for an entree, we even were talking about just asking for the bill and canceling the entree, but right as we were going to ask for the check, our food came out of the kitchen. This is the ONE instance where I wish the service had been terrible and the wait long. But unfortunately, like I already stated, the wait staff was great. Stuck at this point, we faced our entree (which was one of their signature dishes, the Kkanpungi). We both hesitantly dug in, and were mildly surprised. The chicken quality was better than the skewers we had already had and the flavor wasn't terrible. It was coated in layer after layer of sugary sweet sauce though, and we could only eat a couple pieces each before we threw in the towel, asked for the check, and promised each other we would never come back to this place and ONLY recommend it to our mortal enemies.",

Server was very rude and not communicative when I asked questions. Not to mention I'm sitting outside with my dog waiting for my hot miso and sake to warm me up. I confront my server about my service and ask her if she's okay because I work in the industry myself. I know what it's like to have off days. No apology. Just blames me for canceling my sake, miso, and edamame because I've been waiting 10 minutes for it. As soon as I bring up the fact that I've been waiting for 10 minutes for my drink and that I'm upset about it, she responds with \"you cancelled it\". I said \"yes but I ordered it as soon as I sat down...\" trying to explain I cancelled my \"for here\" order because it was taking so long and I thought my to go was about to be ready. She then asks \"well do you have your ID?\" I said \"yes! Why didn't you ask for it when I first ordered?\" I just get a dumbfounded look, hand her my ID, and she's back in 5 seconds with my sake. Worst service I have ever received and I was nothing but polite about it.

I had a curry chicken hot pot which was fine but I specifically asked the bartender if they could do a vegetarian hot pot or anything really for my girlfriend which I was going to get to go since she wasn't with me. He came back and said that they could do my same dish without the chicken. I SPECIFICALLY asked if the broth was vegetarian to which he replied YES.  I tried the broth from the \"vegetarian\" to go order once I got to my car and it tasted the same as the meat one I had in the restaurant. I grew up working in restaurants thus I consider myself decent with distinguishing flavors. Well, I gave him the benefit of the doubt initially but on the way home I thought I should double check so I called them. I was told the broth is a pork broth and that the can't even be made vegetarian! Well I'm 20 min away now and fuming because not only is my gf vegetarian but she's allergic to pork! Luckily I took the extra measure to check. This is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE especially to someone who worked in the industry for several years and who has a gf with a severe allergy. On top of that I was never offered water and they also forgot my appetizer. Even when I called the girl who answered wasn't even apologetic. They need to train their staff better or they will be liable if someone did have an allergic reaction.",

But that isn't to say that the sushi is bad. It is just that the spicy edamame is just so good! I've tried Zu's signature and basic rolls. Haven't been disappointed yet.

Sushi was on par with standard, good quality sushi. I got the Bolgogi grill and it was flavorful and juicy. Rice was standard but good and moist. They provided one type of soy sauce and it seemed to be low sodium so that was great, also it was a better quality than most standard sushi restaurants. For sushi I got the seared albacore and onion roll and the flavors meshed perfectly!   Staff wise, they were on point, quick with ordering and keeping up with everything. No complaints!

We got there right as happy hour was ending and the sushi bar was closing. Ordered some chicken, meatball, and sausage skewers first. The meatballs resembled the swedish meatballs from IKEA and the sausages were legit the Cheddar Lil Smokies from the grocery store. I couldn't believe it. I also ordered the seafood yaki udon and it was smothered in sauce and so sweet I couldn't even finish it. My boyfriend ordered a couple of the other skewers too but they were just so small and all tasted like they were marinaded in the same terriyaki sauce, not worth the price. So disappointing.",

But these items are quite expensive and it becomes more than a full cost of a meal.  The meat kabob was like a hamburger meat. One small round piece. I was expecting steak meat. Or at least something bigger.  The poke rice bowl looked appetizing however. Will have to try next time if not on a budget.",

If you don't know what something is, tell the customer you'll find out not oh,  I wish I knew and then wait. Anyways, aside from this, the food was perfect. Everything tasted great, fresh, and very nice presentation. Place has a very cool vibe and the staff was helping one another which is cool to see. Our server was nice, seemed a bit too busy though maybe a bit understaffed that night not sure. In any case we will return again.

Happy Hour specials are the way to go. 3-7pm on weekdays. Better bang for your buck. They have a large list of appetizers, highly recommend the Spam cheese fries, any of the skewers or wings.   Hot pots are amazing, large portions and they come in these cool black cast iron pots.   The ringer of the whole place, their sushi rolls. These are some of the best I've had so far in the valley. Try the Jalapeno Vegas Roll, you won't be disappointed. Pair it with a saki bomb or iced green tea, and you'll be set.",

It felt like a completely different atmosphere. Our waitress was also the bartender, and the room was full. She wasn't very attentive and we did end up ordering through on of our favorite waitresses.   The menus were discolored and cracked, there were very dirty areas of the restaurant and we both agreed that this did not seem like a bar area. There weren't many tables, and the restrooms were right by our seats. We ordered Asahi and drank it straight from the bottles because of how dirty our glasses were.   The back door to leave, opens up right to a gate which goes the opposite way - which felt so odd. The whole vibe felt like a completely different restaurant, and not like the feeling we normally experience while here.   Our food as always was great which was the saving grace of our night. I would recommend this restaurant ONLY if you sit in the front half of the building. It truly was a disappointing experience sitting in the bar, and not the main room.",

It's our new favorite place to have drink(s) and woof down some eats with friends. The value is pretty incredible.  Here's the lowdown on our orders:  *Junmai Sake- please see photo, speaks for itself *Sapporo draft beer! Cheer's! *Edamame- would order this even if it was not free with Yelp-checkin. Fried Calamari- Total 5 stars! Fried perfectly and with paprika dusting makes for fabulous food while drinking. *Shishito Peppers- love the broth they sit in. I secretly use it for the fried calamari ;) *Agedashi Tofu- soft tofu fried then served in a sauce lending itself to be delish!  *Spicy Tuna roll loaded with a well done tuna filling *Yellowtail spicy roll also with a nice kick and flavor *Yellowtail Sushi( just look at the colors pop!) *Salmon  Sushi-please see photos of splendorous colors! Altogether makes for a relaxing wonderful evening with friends Joyce W. and Michael W. who live to enjoy!   They have a large parking lot attached so parking has never been an issue. Try it out and see how you like this place. As always, Thanks for reading!",

    "text": "On the average Wednesday, I would be cooking dinner. But, today we decided to treat ourselves. And treat ourselves we did. I ordered the tonkatsu with curry, my wife ordered the spicy crab roll, and we had a salmon Kama between us.   The tonkatsu: I do not really eat pork outside of the barbecue form, but oh em gee will I house some tonkatsu. It was crispy, crunchy, and outrageously juicy by itself. But, once you dip it in the sauce...divine. The curry was superb as well. It was rich. It was thick. Dayum, it was thicc. And it was exactly what I needed to fuel my fight through the rest of the week.   The spicy crab roll: I did not partake because I had copious amounts of breaded pork and curry to consume, but my wife said it was good. Good did not suffice, so I asked her to be a bit more eloquent. She went to dinner after several hours of studying and her brain was thoroughly frazzled. For her, the crab roll was a nostalgia-inducing experience. It reminds her of her favorite sushi place back home. She is now fully energized with the right amount of heat and crab meat to assault her work.  The salmon Kama: This was the unexpected star. We decided on this interesting piece of salmon cheek instead of the go-to gyoza. Holy mackerel, was this mind-blowing. It's a delicious slab of salmon with grill marks on it. We tore in to just the flesh, then added some lemon juice, then dipped some in the magical sauce that came with it, and each resulted in mutual mmmphermagerdmmm's being exchanged between us. At one point I proclaimed that I wanted to return and order four of these for myself.  If you are on the fence, come here. Eat. Be happy. Leave content with life.",

    "text": "This is going to start out awkwardly. J promised some guests that we would have bulgogi beef at Thanksgiving. I, being the hostess, now have to find cooked, takeout bulgogi. For crying out loud! I suggested getting the meat raw from Mekong and grilling. This would not stand. I am left calling around to Korean BBQ places across the east valley. Each thought I was kidding. Takeout bulgogi! Blasphemous!   Enter Yelp. I am happy to find that Zu Izakaya has it to go, and is basically across the street from my work. Add the ability to order online,  and I'm sold!  I placed an order for 4 bulgogi, and then a slew of items to try for dinner that night. I ordered: cheese spam katsu, squid legs, udon noodles and soft shell crab.   Walking in, the restaurant was quiet and dark. It was very relaxed, with calm decor. I did wait quite a while at the reception to be noticed. My food was given without issue, and was prepared at the designated time. The gentleman seemed appreciative of my business.  The squid legs (tentacles) were a bit chewy and salty, but overall ok. The spam was an experimental purchase. Very good, but weird. The cheese was like Velveeta, so the texture got me. The udon was lovely. Too much devil apple (onion) for me, but I fed them to J. The soft shell crab was the beat part. Crunchy yet perfect inside. I really enjoyed it. The bulgogi was a hit on Turkey Day. I reheated covered in the oven, and it was perfect.  I will visit Zu Izakaya again.",

Anyways, I used the Yelp check-in for a free bowl of edamame (the waitress stated to let the server do the check-in next time --it was kind of awkward and I felt like I was being scolded). It was a Friday evening and did not look very busy. The food was great and water service was on point!   We ordered the: 1. Lollipop roll 2. Seared albacore onion roll 3. Spicy yellowtail roll -- Happy Hour item 4. California roll -- Happy Hour item  They have Happy Hour everyday from 4-7pm and 9-11pm. In addition to the yelp-check in, they offer a free serving of gyoza or ice cream mochi with the Yelp review (I wasn't feeling it, so I didn't look to into utilizing the offer).",

Food was mediocre. We ordered chicken, pork, and steak skewers. The sauce tasted the same for all so it was disappointing. I was hoping for more variety. We also ordered Korean fried chicken. It was drenched in sauce and blah. We ate less than half and decided not to take it home. Our waitress was nice and asked us if we didn't enjoy it. She managed to get us a discount. Good effort on service once again.   Ambiance is nice and modern. Unfortunately, food wasn't as exciting as other yelpers made it to be.  Sad face!!",

If and when things are running a little slow, they are quick to disclose and let you know (in this instance we got there right at 4 and the sushi chef wasn't in, but it didn't matter as we got our dish quickly anyways-- I appreciated them letting me know).   They have a FAB HH and everything had been fresh and well seasoned. I was hesitant to order to the sushi burrito, but my friend April S had it before and made sure we got it.  It wAs a giant roll in rice paper full of delish raw tuna and salmon amount other flavors that provided a great contrast of both flavors and textures.   They offer good drink specials as well. I had a few drafts and them tried the pineapple sujo... It was delish!   Try this place out before going to a chain restaurant. You'll be glad you did!",

You could enjoy all the seafood but the broth did not have an overwhelming seafood base. Just right I would say. Also had a happy hour item. A poke bowl. It was good. Had it with salmon. A little lite in the salmon. Seemed a little too much sesame oil flavor. However over all it was good!  There is a wide selection of udon soup, hot pots, sushi, salads Etc. great variety.

    "text": "Zu Izakaya offers a nice variety of Japanese, Korean, and fusion dishes in small bites or main entrees. We came here right before happy hour ended at 7 which allowed us to indulge in some discounted dishes such as the poke bowl, sushi burrito, agedashi tofu and chicken skewers. We also ordered a few selections from the main menu. This included small bites like asparagus, quail egg, cheese Spam katsu, and meatball skewers. The only larger meal we ordered (Aside from the happy hour poke bowl) was the freshwater eel.  My favorites were the poke and eel. The poke was very fresh, with a deep rich red color, and a good amount of seasoning. The bowl came with rice, nori strips, seaweed, and crab salad. The eel was a beautiful presentation with tender eel, sweet sauce, and vegetables on the bottom. A more unique dish was the \"sushi burrito\" which was basically a modified roll with ingredients like spicy tuna, tamago and crab salad, wrapped in soy paper and cut into 2 like you would cut a burrito in half.  I wasn't as big of a fan of the cheese Spam katsu. The gooey melted cheese was similar to Velveeta and it was way too salty combined with the Spam. I did like the crispy crunch of the breading, but maybe some sweet sauce or a different cheese with the katsu would balance out the flavors more.  When we were seated and ready to order my server took down my friends' orders and then walked away. We had to exclaim to her loudly \"Wait come back\" for her to actually take my order down. There seemed to be a miscommunication about the amount of food we wanted to order but instead of apologizing she had an attitude about it, like it wasn't her fault she decided to leave a customer hanging without taking down their order. Service was better as the meal continued though and drinks were refilled and plates taken away as needed.  Service could use an attitude adjustment, but I'll be back to try more dishes.",

And I swear the soup tasted totally same as Nongshim fast noodle, you know the one is sold for only $2 in supermarket. And they just added very few seafood, some chopped pork and mushrooms, onions, that'll. I did not miss anything. THAT'S ALL. If you go to any Japanese ramen restaurant, at least they would use pork bone and cooked for ten hours. But this? It's just chopped pork.

A little bit salty but may balance the relatively light flavored dishes depending on what else you order.  Albacore ceviche: five stars. The fish was fresh. A lot of onions in the pico de gallo on top which added to the refreshing taste.  Scallop dynamite: seafood and veggies roasted with cheese. Not the typical food you would expect in an Asian resturant, but it was well executed. Surprise in a good way.  Bulgogi mushroom pot: normal hot pot.  Service was great. We dined at the bar.

Can you believe it?? I cannot believe the great prices and the freshness as well as the amazing service. I even gave us free edamame :-) Friendly staff, And attentive wait staff. We will definitely come back to this place on vacation! We are so excited to have found this gem we are here for a few more days, and I am thinking we may have dinner here again tomorrow!",

The restaurant was vibrant and filled up quickly for dinner time. Unfortunately after too many sake bombs I forgot to take any pictures.  I see a lot of other reviews saying that this place is not authentic or that it's not good, but I enjoyed all the food I had here. I would not say it's the best sushi in the valley, but it is still a fun and tasty spot with pretty good happy hour deals. Famed sushi chef Charles P. Thompson once said \"I'm not making art, I'm making sushi\" and that quote completely embodies the vibe here at Zu Izakaya.",

I had three rolls: Spicy Yellowtail rolls without crab mix: which was very good. I thought it was salty but turns out I added a lot of soy sauce. You will feel everything on it. I like this one. Philly rolls: this rolls was made in an excellent way. Cream cheese made it more tasty. Believe me, you will like it.  Las Vegas rolls without eel sauce and crab mix: if there is more than five stars, I would give it to this dish! Excellent and delicious dish. The best Vegas roll I had so far. This dish will make you speechless. Was prepared very good and the taste was phenomenal.   Friendly staff. I would come again for the rolls and the prices of happy hours! I recommend everyone to try the rolls here!",

Not gonna lie, the takoyaki looked almost like swedish meatballs so I was hesitant at first to try them but they certainly were not \"yaki\" whatsoever! (Oo my first pun in a yelp review) Didnt come out too hot so my tongue was spared this time around. As for the rolls, those were pretty yummy as well. I couldnt handle the jalapeno one well due to my weak spice tolerance (still ate it though). Favorite out of the 3 was the crunch salmon roll - mainly cause I love salmon. Overall, no complaints, made for a nice (and early) dinner with family and friends. I gave 4 and not 5 stars mainly because the taste quality was above average but not something I'd give 5 stars for.",

The fried chicken looked (and tasted) like it was made at panda express. please don't get this. The coconut curry was literally made from instant noodles (of some form) definitely packaged. Tonkatsu was the one pretty good thing on this menu. 7/10 on my list of katsu places. The Kal bi was straight up fat. I don't know if thats the style or something but you know it's a problem when the veggies under the dish tasted better than the actual meat. also, got a chicken stick that was fine as usual.  staff was friendly. price was reasonable. portions were big. free edamame (overcooked beans).

We also got the California roll and tuna roll which were generous and satisfying. I couldn't resist but get the Jjambbong hot pot, which was described as Korean-style spicy hot pot with assorted seafood, vegetables, and pork with ramen noodles.

And if you know Jon, you know his favorite hour is Happy Hour [for the alcohol, duh!]. Good thing Zu Izakaya has an amazing and extensive Happy Hour menu. We ordered pretty much everything on the HH menu with a few bottles of Nihon Sakari Junmai sake on the side for a great price tag!  We had a little bit of everything but the stars were definitely the fried calamari and Wasabi Hamachi [not on the HH but definitely worth getting]. To also be enjoyed were gyoza, seaweed salad, squid salad, egg rolls, mozzarella sticks, agedashi tofu, and some various rolls and nigiris. Jon made sure we used our Yelp check-in offer for the free edamame as well. We were practically rolled out of there like a hamster on a hamster wheel but we were happy and full.   Service here was great. We had the lovely Leah as our server with her uncanny Snow White resemblance and James as well. That kid really had his work cut out for him since Jon seemed to enjoy picking on him. ;)   I would definitely come back for that HH menu and to try that Spam & cheese katsu with a bowl of seafood alfredo udon and a bottle of Sayamacha Umeshu Green Tea Soju on the side.",

Ordered probably every kind of yakitori off the menu, our favorite was hands down the mushroom. It was so juicy! I think they use the same glaze for all of them. The sushi was great as well, packed full of fish, big portions! The drinks were also affordable. Tried banana makkoli for the first time and it was bomb. I read from the other reviews they serve it in a kettle with drinking bowls but didn't get that ): Servers attentive and friendly. Would recommend!",

Hot pot is good. Chicken, beef, veggies, all good. Service was attentive and made sure we were treated right. This place is out of the way for a regular visit but anytime we're in the area, we'd definitely have this place on top of the list of a place to eat.",

It was very much appreciated.  As far as the food, we had ordered an array of different items: Las Vegas roll, philly roll, shrimp roll, bulgogi plate, hot pot, roasted peppers, chicken skewers. Everyone loved their dishes. The sushi was so fresh and had great flavor. I did not try the hot pot but those who got it kept raving about it. One friend who has been to Japan several times had said hot pot was pretty authentic.   Definitely recommend trying this place out!",

Both chicken dishes tasted phenomenal. The rice was sticky and cooked to perfection.  They have a lot of seafood options, which made me sad, as I don't have a taste for things from the ocean. But if you're into that kind of thing, I bet it's great! Besides seafood they do have a lot of other options. For next time I've got my gaze set on the coconut curry hot pot...  I would not hesitate to come back. The food is on the pricey side, but if you can afford it, it's totally worth it!",

The atmosphere is great with awesome music playing and an attentive staff. The shishito pepper appetizer was so yummy! I would suggest that as a must try. The egg rolls were also delicious. However, the appetizer portion only comes with three rolls, so make sure to order more than one if you have a big group! The sushi was just as good as their other location, Bei, right down the street. The Lollipop Roll was fun and actually stayed together when I picked it up on the stick! It's very refreshing having a roll wrapped in cucumber rather than rice. I also suggest the Ebi Mayo Roll. The shrimp that tops this roll are fantastic! I don't know how they make them but you have to try it out! YUM!",

We had the Jjambbong hot pot which was also tasty but spicy.  It was a seafood and pork soup/broth that had ramen in it with rice on the side. This was a pretty big meal though so it's definitely for sharing.   All in all, next time in I'm Scottsdale, I will definitely be back and try the other dishes.",

Las Vegas roll was oddly sweet which I was just not a fan of. The hot pot was highly regarded and sounded really good but unfortunately it was super salty, even for me and I like salty things, to the point where I could only eat just a little and it was not spicy one bit which was really disappointing. Not sure I'd be willing to come back to try other things on the menu.",

I absolutely love the appetizers like the cheese spam Katsu and neobani sliders. The cheese spam is definitely a guilty pleasure since it's so heavy but it's perfectly crisp and cheesy. I'm also obsessed with their skewers, which are usually on their happy hour menu (did I mention they have HH and reverse HH?). The Scallop Dynamite is my all time favorite! It has scallop, salmon, cheese, and mushroom so it's basically everything I love in one. Their sushi rolls and burritos are great too. Honestly, I have yet to order something I didn't like from here.  I can't wait to come back.   P.S The white peach sake is only $9 during happy hour and it is sooooo good!",

And I got to try banana nigori sake; I'm usually a sucker for banana-flavored food and drink, and this was a treat! Service was very capable and attentive, though it was mostly empty on a Tuesday night so I can't really say how it might be when busy. 4 stars plus a strong desire to eat there again and give it 5.",

I ended up ordering the Scallops Dynamite (based on the servers recommendation) It was basically a plate of cheese over vegetables with the smallest scallops is have ever seen. It must be some pretty high grade cheese for the price. It did not taste bad but entirely too much cheese and they could up the quality of the seafood in it.   In the end I will probably go back eventually and try something else as it is a clean place and the staff has been decent but I will never order that again.",

I guess it's hip?",

I had a friend suggest a girls dinner here and so glad she did!! Here is a run down of what we had and like:  We started with the Ahi Tacos and Chicken tacos - They come in two so this was perfect for the 4 of us each getting one small taco. Both were delicious- I did prefer the tuna over the chicken.   We also shared 2 orders of the Gyoza - perfectly crispy and a great dipping sauce - cant go wrong here  Happy Hour here is great!!   Now on to the GLORY of meals!  HOT POT HEAVEN!!  These bowls are HUGE and we each got our own (too much food).  I would share between two people or be ready for left overs.  I ordered the Spicy Kimchi Pot with no pork but tofu and mushrooms! So good - perfect spice level and great compliment with the kimchi.  My friend ordered the Jjambbong Pot - if you like seafood this is a must!!! It is packed with different seafood and the flavor is out of this world good ( waitress recommended this pot as well).  We ended up mixing both of our broths and made Hot Pot Magic. You're Welcome.  If you have seen this place while driving down Scottsdale next time stop in and try it out!! So worth it!",

Ordered couple of skewers, a hot pot, rolls and side dishes, and honestly the foods were not that good except skewers. I've grown up with korean/japanes foods but the quality in the place is kind of disappointing. Staffs were very friendly but not well trained, especially for details in menu.  I could bump them up to 3 stars but young staffs made a noise at the corner of the restaurant all the time, which was so annoying",

They have a beautiful dining room in the front of the restaurant and a more casual bar area around the back. The only difference is just a change of decor - we've always had great service on both sides and you can order the full menu even if you are sitting at the bar. During happy hour they have deals on their drinks and appetizers. I really like their crab cakes and egg rolls. I don't actually eat sushi, but my boyfriend loves the Las Vegas roll. I feel like the non-happy hour food is a little bit pricey but it's definitely not unreasonable. If you are in the area you should totally check this place out.

They have happy hour 7 days a week and we ended up getting 2 saki bombs, 3 different skewers (all amazing), edamame, and egg rolls (also amazing) totaling $30.  It's got parking, and is low key so wasn't too busy when we went.  All the food came out at different times, but was perfect for happy hour and was so quick.  Overall, highly recommend.",

There's so much to try it's hard to resist ordering too much food!   I'm glad they have a sushi menu now, I think when they first opened they didn't. But their rolls are just as good as their sister location, Bei.  And their hot pots are so amazing, but they can feed a crowd!!! Most recently I tried their coconut curry one and it is DIVINE!!!",

Not sure if they are not getting enough business in that area, but after we sat down, we watched as they sent a group of 5 over there and they all came back 30 seconds later.    Service was ok, nothing special; as the young girls move from serving tables to charging and checking their phones by the front desk.  The best part of the meal were the bulgogi tacos I ordered, so I assume some of the Korean dishes and skewers are good; but this is not a sushi place that we expected.",

    "text": "First time in, found this place while looking for something else.  The menu was sort of sushi  + yakitori + izakaya + Korean.  Very wide range of food.  We started with a couple of skewers, shrimp, chicken, and scallops the first two were fine,  except for the scallops,  more on that later. . . Then we had a couple of sushi rolls, spider crab and spicy tuna with toasted garlic.  The later being a new favorite for me.   We finished with a couple of hotpots, mussels and spicy mixed seafood.  Also one of our party had a HUGE yellowtail collar.  All were very good and we finished all we could hold.    Back to the scallops, if you cook, you know that some shellfish is sold by the units/lb.  U-16/20 shrimp are 16 to 20 shrimp per pound or a little less than an ounce per shrimp.  Zu advertises and had on the menu \"U-10\" Scallops.  That's 1.6 oz. per scallop, just the right size to sear.  We expected 2 orders of BIG scallops, roasted yakitori style.   We got scallops, they were maybe U-16s or less.  Tiny, about 3/4 of an inch in diameter.  So don't order the scallops and you should be OK.  I suggest the manager either get some dry U-10s to grill, or take the \"U-10\" reference off the menu.",

I got up and walked to where the kitchen entrance was and got a rag and soda water to get the staining out. I was sitting with soaked jeans for most my dinner. Not very enjoyable. When my bill came they did nothing for me. I had to ask for the manager to comp the roll for the inconvenience. Based on that alone I don't think I'll be back.",

Zu had a really great selection of food - skewers, hot pot, sushi/sashimi. I ordered the pork (8.5/10) and steak (3/10) skewer. From the sashimi menu, I ordered the salmon and seared tuna. The size of the sashimi was a little on the smaller side. The salmon was okay. I would recommend the seared tuna - 9/10. From the hotpot menu, I ordered the Nagasaki Seafood Pot - comes with assorted seafood, vegetables and ramen noodles. I added spam on the side too but the server forgot about it. There wasn't anything too special about it for the price $16.95. I probably wouldn't order it again.   I think overall the restaurant is ok. I wouldn't make the drive all the way from N. Scottsdale just to come here but if I am ever in the area, I would definitely stop in for the cheap skewers!",

After stopping in for the first time, on my birthday in mid-August, I've decided that this is going to be my go-to sushi joint.

I hate having to keep pushing off a restaurant and hearing it from other people!  The place itself is unique with a large patio area and a community bar in the middle of the restaurant.    After a visit to Japan and going to some Izakaya bars there I was stoked to try one here in PHX!  So to start we ordered the shishito peppers, meatballs, and chicken skewers.  All their skewers are drizzled with yakatori sauce.  The shishito peppers had an extra sprinkle of cayenne peppers giving it some kick.  The meatballs and chicken I thought could be grilled a little longer since it's that extra char that brings out the flavors.  We also order some Yellowtail Nigiri and the Tuna Carpaccio.  Definitely had better Yellowtail and elsewhere and fresher, but it does the job.  The Tuna Carpaccio was subtle and was laying on a bed of ponzu like sauce.  The Jalapeno atop was the kicker and the tuna was melted in your mouth; best bite of the night I would say!  In the end, Zu Izakaya has a great happy hour menu and price point.  The place is easy going and the community table and patio is definitely an allure.  Though I rather would have a traditional Izakaya bar where it's dink, tiny, and full of smoke from the grill; this place will have to do for now! - Enjoy!",

We got a poke salad that was delicious, and I'm usually not a salad fan. We continued our meal with chili garlic edamame that was warm, spicy and perfection. Next up was the pork gyoza, it was crispy and flavorful. \"How can all the dishes be this good,\" I wondered. Next up, we got the bulgogi with rice and it was just as good as any other Korean barbecue place I've been too. Lastly, we had to try their sushi rolls. The jalapeno Vegas roll was deliciously spicy, there was a habanero jalapeno roll or something new that was also really good. The only miss of the entire night was the spicy tuna roll, and that was because everything else was just so flavorful, that the spicy tuna palled in comparison. We also got a bottle of flavored apple sake, that was so easy to drink it was dangerous. This place is a hidden gem, I will definitely come back!",

The place is spacious and open with a good amount of space and seating. Their food is amazing!  There is parking behind the restaurant but I can see it filling up quickly on a busy night.  The service here was great. There staff was fun and made sure we got what we wanted. They even recommended items that were popular or ones that would be good to try out. Our server was awesome!  Their pricing seem to be pretty high. You get to spend quite a bit on one dish. Would put this place in the moderately priced category.  I would recommend trying this place out. While it can be a bit pricy the food and variety is really good.",

We love going Thursday's because there's plenty of throwback HipHop, which allows us to eat a vibe out at the same time.  We love our sever Jolene, she is so cool and down to earth and definitely adds to our experience.

    "text": "Came here finally on my recommendation from a friend who is from Japan to come check it out....and also, because I probably pass here all the time and wanted to see how this place is since I love Japanese food.  On this day, I was a mood eater. I wanted to eat italian but, yet I wanted to eat japanese food..hahahahaha! Couldn't make up my mind, it's bad being a mood eater sometimes!  As we were driving in we saw this cute little bar area on the opposite of the restaurant and had no idea it is connected to Zu Izakaya until after we went into the restaurant.    Our host/waitress were really nice and talkative, she so funny I have a strong hawaiian pidgin accent so it's not hard to know that we are not from AZ and she picked up on it and asked \"Are you guys from Hawaii?\" we crack up laughing and I said yes, but now we live here.  She knows the struggle we have sometimes with finding really good asian foodies here in AZ.  So it was nice to just have the conversation with her and just connect.  Our food selection though it wasn't that bad at all...Everything that we had was super tasty and get this, I was surprised that they had a half pasta/udon dish that I never heard of and I just had to ask our waitress 'So, how is this?\" lol, She had told me that before their restaurant it used to be an italian place and their head chef had stayed on..she said that dish was super good and that I should try it. I am so glad that I did, I had exactly what I was craving for - how ironically funny! \"ASK AND I SHALL RECEIVE\" hahahahah....  Their dynamite scallops was good as well as their  tofu, it was refreshing and fulfilling at the same time for appetizer selection. I don't think the dynamite selection was an appetizer though- but, still good to go!  I love their sake special it really hit the spot although we missed the happy hour was still good!   However, the waitress did tell us that their bar area (the one I mentioned earlier of the little bar on the opposite side of the building). She said it is happy hour ALL day in their bar area but, it is not connected from inside of the restaurant.  So next time we come back, we'll go inside the bar area and they also have karaoke. Great place to bring my Ohana when they are in town...We love good food, drinks, and singing when we are merry/having a good time - PAU HANA time!   Ohh and there fried cheesecake dessert was winnaz....gotta sample it if they have it on their menu or specials",

Free edaname from yelp check-in is ordinary, garnished with sea salt.  Agedashi tofu: seaweed garnish feels very inappropiate, but slices of scallion that would be better for the taste are present (but in amounts so little that don't make a difference). Excessively sweet, would prefer some salt to cut into the flavor overall.  Gyoza from Yelp review: good crust from deep frying but clearly store-bought. The sauce is interesting, however - it matches the taste of the filling perfectly (not necessarily a good thing) with large notes of sweetness.  Bulgogi Mushroom Pot: onions largely lack flavor, as do most of the other ingredients. Udon noodles-add on is a good addition, but are in extremely limiting quantity. There is a hint of sweetness in the bulgogi in the chew. Enoki and button mushrooms only. To warn: there were only two 'bites' of enoki. Broth lacks depth, mostly salty.  Overall, this place was nice for their free offers. The establishment was accommodating. Would not return but encourage others to try!",

Arrived at 9 PM, by chance, which was start of happy hour!! Off happy hour got agedashi tofu which was reasonable...relatively crunchy...flavor was good. Then got skewers of shrimp (tender and tasty), scallops (small but tasty), chicken (soft), meat ball (tender and good taste), and mushrooms (also good). Got the pork gyoza hot pot with clear noodle...little salty but big portion and pretty good!! The unagi rice bowl was reasonable and flavor was good but the unagi was not really crispy enough...so so. Overall about 3.5 stars so round up to 4 stars!!",

The skewers were good but had the same sauce on them. The pork and chicken had the same flavor because of this. The crab cakes were average and the vegas roll was standard but still good. I would recommend this place as their menu has a wide variety of options. I'm looking forward to come here again and try a hot pot!",

    "text": "Interesting Korean/Japanese fusion concept in the Tempe area. Although their Yelp rating is very high, they do offer complimentary appetizers/desserts to incentivize reviews. The 3 star rating is because of their small portions and high prices. Service was normal, but the main entrees took slightly longer than usual. Here are some of the dishes that we ordered: - Edamame: warm & nicely seasoned (comes w/ Yelp check in) - Gyoza: thin skin, very hot when it came out, pretty juicy (comes w/ Yelp review) - Chicken Skewer: not much fat, slightly seasoned  - Galbi: very tasty & good quality but a small portion - Fresh Water Eel: too mushy, would've liked it to be more crispy; some small & sharp bones were found in a few of the pieces - Chicken Curry Hot Pot: was mildly spicy, a little bit too salty, most of the chicken was at the bottom; large portion of Curry soup",

This last time, we brought my Uncle, Aunt, & Grandma and they loved it.   We ordered Ebi Mayo Shrimp, Agedashi Tofu, Salmon Pico de Gallo roll, Mirin Mackerel, Lollipop Sushi, Coconut Curry Chicken Pot, Freshwater Eel Grill, Shishito Peppers, and Kkanpungi.  For appetizers, the ebi mayo shrimp and agedashi tofu are must tries! You will not be disappointed!",

Everything was EXCELLENT! Including our waitress! One negative note- we ordered a mushroom skewer (2.00) and a side of kimchi (2.00)- was not happy with either of them unfortunately. The mushrooms were severely undercooked and the kimchi was very fizzy with a weird taste. Otherwise they would have gotten 5 stars!",

A hard combo to beat and hasn't been matched anywhere else.  They often offer yelp check-in coupons and so I've gotten free Edamame a couple of times.  The spicy garlic edamame is TO DIE FOR.  They are not stingy with the garlic and the spice gives an otherwise sort of bland item a real kick.",

The tuna tartare came with a quail egg and Asian pear. It was good, the atmosphere was nice, and we came after a jiujitsu class so we enthusiastically devoured it all. Very satisfying!  I also totally want their cat-themed soy sauce containers!",

It was not good. We ordered an appetizer. It came after our main course and only after we asked twice about it. The fish in the sushi roles was all mashed which was obviously to hide how little fish you actually get in the rolls. The rolls were remarkably bland (probably due to the minimal fish). The beer selection has only one local beer. The wait staff were inattentive for how few patrons were around.",

The broth wasn't bad but the ramen noodle were the kind that came from actual top ramen. If they upgraded to better noodles it would taste better! The ramens do come in huge portions tho! I also hear the kalbi meat is good but never tried. They have a separate dining area for the bar, this area has all the happy hour menu. Thy also have a karaoke machine on the bar side. The food only side looks cuter tho! I would try it again, especially when I want asian food late at night!",

The Udon noodle was chewy and I love Alfredo so... I would like to re-order. :D  Dish 4: Tang Soo Yuk -This is my least favorite when I compare with other Tang Soo Yuk. I tasted strong pepper. I do not really taste Tang Soo Yuk from this dish. Taste more something fusion. It does not taste bad it taste different. If you are looking fore real Tang Soo Yuk, I would not suggest.",

    "text": "TLDR: Great service and good food that can be a pretty good deal if you know order properly.  Came here because it was close to the airport and we had a flight in a few hours. BF and I both ordered a hotpot with rice and noodle, he got the oden and I got the spicy crab. In hindsight we could have just gotten one oden and shared because it came with so many carbs already. I also got a salmon nigiri was average in price and quality. The food in general was average, very satisfying but nothing amazing. I always like restaurants that give a lot of different options and this place is one of them. I feel like these are the best places to go with a big group because I tend to like to eat the same thing over and over again but the people I hang out with will get tired of the things I like.  If it was for just the food, I'd probably only give it 3/4 stars, but the service was exceptional. Our waitress was really really nice and helpful the entire time. We asked her if we could drink a bottle of champagne in the restaurant because we didn't want to  bring it on our flight and check a bag. We didn't really expect her to say yes but she did, she also went and got us chilled glasses without us even asking.   Gratuity is included but we ended up each giving her a dollar or so more because she really deserved it. The place is open late because its a bar so I would definitely visit it next time I have a late flight going out or in.",

Free food is motivating, but they are good enough that they shouldn't be doing this. Shame on them.  Crowded Friday night.  Very friendly service. But: S-L-O-W. Easily 30 minute wait to be seated with tables that could have been cleared that entire time. Service was slow to get order in, to get food out and in between courses. All the while, the too-few server staff were leaving empty tables which could have been cleared to seat the growing line of people waiting to dine. Several just left. Too bad. The food is really, really good!  Tuna sashimi app was excellent though pricey as was the gyoza. Spicy chili shrimp was off the charts good. The grilled pork was only ok and not something I would get again. Green tea ice cream just didn't seem all that necessary when it was valued the same as the gyoza for the Yelp freebie. So no dessert for us even though the friendly server did suggest it.  Once done dining, I kid you not, it took more than 30 minutes to get the tab taken care of. Once the server came to pick up the check with my CC, which I put down the instant the check came, the processing was quick. But, 30 minutes?",

    "text": "Best agedashi tofu I've had! Broth is complex and the tofu is cut to my favorite size so that it's still crisp on the outside.  Also had the salmon kama, excellent flavor and char on that.   Bulgogi is on the sweeter side and comes with a lot of caramelized onions.  Customer service is excellent. I asked the server for her favorite dishes since this is my first time here.  We will definitely be back! Yumm!",
