However, to my surprise, they claim that they do not have any availability for the remainder of the evening!  Even though from what we could see, there were several empty tables.  After we walked out disappointed, we saw that we could make reservations online, and those were available.  Not only that, but when I had called the restaurant to make a reservation, they had no problem getting me a reservation (in the next 20-30 minutes).  However, walking into the restaurant in person, no reservations available.   Must be completely judgmental on the way people look.   If you are not wearing items of clothing costing over $3,000 ....you can forget about getting a seat by simply walking in.   What a snobbish little restaurant....fits well being placed in Scottsdale!",

The waiter brought one out with a candle and placed it in front of Dad. We sang, he began happily eating it. When the person who ordered the cake asked if theirs was forthcoming, the waiter said - we had to have something to put a candle in, that was yours. Really?? They charged for the cake and gave Dad a box of truffles at the end of dinner as his bday comp. Not classy and rather uncomfortable. Sorry Flemings. That was not up to par.",

    "text": "Came to Fleming's after not visiting for many years. We have always loved coming here. Upon seating they gave us a tablet that contained the drink menu, which I think is a great idea because you get a visual of what some of their cocktails look like. After ordering they bring out their bread that comes with 2 different butters that are to die for.  The menu is what you would expect from a steakhouse, but I still enjoyed every bite. I started with the shrimp cocktail and then a filet w/ a side of bearnaise sauce. I think my favorite part was the Fleming's Potatoes, the jalapenos give it a great taste but the good news for those who aren't into spicy is that it is mild.  Finished off my meal with the carrot cake, which was by far my favorite dessert there.     The reason for our visit was to celebrate my husbands birthday, so during the meal they surprised us with a $25 gift card. Great touch as it makes you feel special and almost guarantees them that you will return to dine again. Win-win for everyone. My husbands favorite  part was at the end of our meal they gave him a box of 4 truffles to take home. He said that they were delicious, which I am assuming to be True as he wouldn't share them with me.     I would like to add that we also had our 9 month old with us and they were so friendly with him even when he did make a mess on the floor. They even came to specifically see how he was enjoying his pieces of steak, as it was his first filet ever.",

First off, we had a reservation for 7:45, the hostess said we are a \" little bit\" late on our reservation times so feel free to get drinks at the bar. Well at 8:45 we started getting pissed off along with all the other people with reservations getting sat hours after their reservation. Finally, after waiting over an hour past our time and finding out that even then we had 7 people in front of us, we just left. I thought upscale restaurants should have their acts together enough to honor your reservation time at least somewhat close...absolutely ridiculous!!",

    "text": "Eh...  We had some gift cards from Christmas, so we decided to dress up a little and check the place out.  We started out in the bar, where luckily it was HH. The bartender was so nice and down to earth and she mixed us an amazing gin concoction off their HH menu. It was potent, refreshing, not too sweet, and went down way too easy. The complimentary freshly made potato chips at the bar are scrumptious and perfect to settle your belly when drinking these strong drinks.   Dinner wasn't as great as the bar experience. My husband ordered a filet Mignon and I ordered a few sides, since I'm a vegetarian. Now, I don't mind going to a steak place as long as the side dishes are impeccable. I'm perfectly content with some delicious starches and veggies. I was looking forward to sampling their sides but our server wasn't very enthusiastic when I told him I was a vegetarian. He mentioned what he thought was good but he didn't really seem keen on selling what little they had for vegetarians. Hmmmmm...  On to the food... I had mac and cheese. It was good, not great. No comparison to the green chili mac n cheese at Roaring Fork. I had a loaded baked potato sans bacon. Again, just okay. Can't really screw that up. I did find the skin of the potato to be tasty... they salted it quite well. Had sauteed spinach too... was good. I ordered a dirty martini and it was awesome!   My husband was looking forward to his steak since he barely gets to go to steakhouses. He ordered his steak medium rare and was disappointed that it came out medium. He did not want to return it because we had to be at a show in less than an hour. He said the taste and quality was good but he could replicate it at home very easily for a fraction of the price. He had a tiny side of Fleming potatoes which was tasty but it was the exact same sauce they used for the mac n cheese. So don't order both because they taste exactly the same!  Our server was okay. Kind of cold and I felt like he was disappointed that we didn't order more expensive items. I did like that the manager stopped and said \"hi\". I told him I was a vegetarian and he recommended the ravioli appetizer. It sounded delicious. He was very lively and personable. Wish he was our server...  Atmosphere was weird... I expected it to be dark and hyper masculine, after all it is a steak house, but the wood paneling and extreme darkness was unnerving. With that setting you would expect the background music to be jazz or some Sinatra or something wouldn't you? Nope. They were playing top 40 from the last 2 decades. Kind of weird to be listening to U2 while eating steak and drinking dirty martinis.  Overall, I don't think the experience was worth the money. Each side dish was $10. Most of the steaks don't come with sides and they are well over $30. Luckily we had gift cards, but otherwise our bill came out to $105. For under $20 I could have made the same meal and probably make it taste much better.   We did have an excellent experience at the bar. My husband was drooling over the bar burger the person next to us was having. I am open to trying HH there again.",

Did the bartender take Bartending 101?  The waiter asks \"what kind of garnish would you like in your Manhattans.....an orange peel?\" Ok, whatever.  Look at the picture of the calamari appetizer...we've had it before...really good sauce on it.  Ours was totally dry with NO SAUCE whatsoever....a few pepper slices thrown on it.  Then we got the burger and fries (Happy Hour), which also in the past has been very good.  Not this time!  The kicker was that they ripped us off with our gift card.  I gave them a $50 gift card that has never been used....THEY INFORMED US THAT IT ONLY HAD $30 ON IT!!!  Really???!!!  Course, how can we prove it?!  Never going back!  Glad my gift cards are finished!!  No more!!  No wonder the Happy Hour wasn't totally crowded like in the past!!!",

I can say I went to a steakhouse with good food, but there wasn't anything exceptionally great about Flemmings. If I was going to compare Flemmings to another restuarant it would be Oscars Steakhouse in Downtown Las Vegas with that \"Beef, Booze, and Broads\" feel.  Good steak, good drinks and even a waitress pumped full of botox.   The food we tried included the calamari appetizer, wedge salad, swordfish, filet, crab, and asparagus side.  Everything was cooked as it should have been but again nothing that really made you say WOW after that first bite! They did have a great wine list with 100+ wines by the glass.    Our service was excellent and everything was timed perfectly and our waitstaff was very attentive and ensured we had all we needed throughout the meal, including beverages.

    "text": "Flemings is, for me, just about as good as a steak house gets.  Warm, inviting and not pretentious.  If I had to pick nits (and I do) I would just say the service can be breathtakingly fast - so if you're going to linger over martini's, make sure your waiter knows not to fire your order until you're ready.  Oh yeah, the martinis are large, cold and good.  Otherwise the service is top notch.  I really like a place where waiters are trained to observe every table, not just their own.  When we needed something, as soon as we looked around for our waiter, another waiter noticed and came over immediately to assist.  As soon as we were done with one course a passing waiter picked up the dishes, checked on our experience so far and asked if there was anything else they could do. That makes for a great dining experience.  The Porcini rubbed tenderloin in gorgonzola sauce was great.  Ask for extra sauce on the side and you'll get some chunks of gorgonzola in it.  The added texture really helps the sauce.   The scallops in lobster cream sauce were equally good.  Slightly crisp outside, sweet on the inside, perfectly complemented by the lobster cream sauce.  The vegetables served with the scallops were perfectly done.  The mushroom ravioli is a must-get.  We always share it, it could easily be a perfect light entree for one.  The atmosphere is dark (as a steak house should be) but not too dark.  There is none of the pretentiousness of some other houses and the staff are willing to accommodate almost any request.  Thanks Nick!   5 stars!",

    "text": "To put it in one line Fleming's is a 3-star restaurant posing as a 5-star restaurant.  The issue for me at my visit to Flemings was service.  The hostess was rather unenthusiastic.  It seemed was just her job to point us in the correct direction, which was the bar to wait as our table got prepared.  For a 5-star place, a reservation is a reservation, and the table should darned well be ready when advertised.  I expect to wait for a table at Outback, with the little buzzing and flashing beeper, but Flemings isn't Outback.  Right?  And as I will state later, getting the food orders correct was an even larger issue.  For background, I was part of a large group (11 people) for dinner.  The bread served before the meal was absolutely delicious; fresh, hot, with a crispy crust, tender middle.  Drinks and salads were ordered.  I got a Caesar salad, and all I can say is that it was adequate. I have had a better Caesar salad at my employer's cafeteria.  But, I'm not there for the salad.  Fleming's is all about steaks.    The server moved around the table and took orders.  Our server was cheery and tried to make small-talk conversation with the table.  She took the orders where overall there were 8 steak orders (some of the couples got one meal and split it) and various sides.  I ordered the prime rib-eye; whenever I go to a steak place, it is my benchmark meal.  When the food arrived I had a very nice, although I would call it a bit small piece of Filet Mignon in front of me.  A very nice cut of meat, but it wasn't what I ordered.  Also, one of the couples at the table was not brought any food.  So, doing the math, the serving staff has a 25% chance in bungling your order.  The staff re-took the incorrect/missing orders and about 5 minutes later the manager was by to apologize.  The couple who had the missing order was offered a shrimp cocktail; I was not.  Maybe that is why I'm the odd person at the table.  I started munching on the community sides watching my other friends enjoying their steaks.  As for the sides, they were adequate like the Caesar salad; nothing to see here; although the Fleming potatoes were better than average.  About 15 minutes later, my steak arrived, a bit rare for medium rare.  Gee that would make it rare.  I was hungry, and I ate it anyway.  The steak was very nice.  Tender and tasty, the way a good rib-eye ought to be.  To be honest it was one of the best rib-eyes I ever had, although slightly undercooked.  Much more tender than ones in those cowboy steak places.  There is something about the flavor of fat from a good rib-eye, and that is why it is my benchmark steak.  I was not alone on the notion under-cooked nature of the steak.  I guess from a management standpoint, undercooked is better than overcooked.  But I am of the school nothing goes back unless I am always within eyesight of my food.  I've seen the movie \"Waiting\".    We got desserts, and did them community style.  The walnut turtle pie seemed to be the best liked.  I didn't do the walnut turtle pie.  Walnuts are a bit bitter for my tastes.  The timing for delivery of food was a bit slow.  This was \"European\" dining.  Reservation at 6:30, offered dessert 9:30.  So, in a way we owned the table for the evening, or maybe the staff realized they were not going to turn the table for another customer, and with a large group tip was set, so there was no need to hustle for the tip.  Slow service is fine, if that is what you expect.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed chatting with my other friends at the table, but this was not typical \"American\" dining service.  On the good side, the water glasses were filled with great regularity.  Water glasses were 12 oz glasses, and these glasses never got below half full.  Service from the bar was not as good.  I ordered a glass of Shiraz before the salad, and the glass arrived after the salad.  So, about 20 minutes to get my glass of house Shiraz.  With respect to the food errors, the manager did deduct the two meal errors from the bill, and that was very generous from Fleming's management.  But mistakes like this will crush high end places.  From a profit perspective, that's $80 that Flemings management isn't going to get, and a not so stellar review on Yelp. So for me, I give Flemings a 4-star for food, 3-star for service, and a 2-star for value.  As for me, I'm not a high end restaurant guy, but from the small amount of travel I do for the company I work for, I have seen some higher end restaurants.  I was expecting penultimate experience, and I received an Outback level service experience.    Ultimately, the question is: \"Did you get what you paid for\"?  For my money, it is a resounding no.  But Flemings is in the business to appease business types with expense reports and such.  It is sufficiently snooty enough to impress your customer, so the corporate sales guy can give the impression to his customers that the company he represents \"cares\".",

We enjoyed the $6 happy hour menu sitting at the bar starting with tenderloin carpaccio , sweet chile calamari , shrimp cocktail, all were worth the $6 each.  Although we had the sweet chile sauce on the side for the calamari very good appetizers shrimp good flavor cooked in house.  My wife for main course had the lamb chops with fried polenta served with it she really liked this dish the chops were the size of lolli pops three pieces but very very good.  I had the in house made $6 prime 8oz burger cooked rare with swiss and cheddar cheeses bacon on a nice brioche bun it was cooked rare and tasted very good.  Also served with this burger was two large fried onion rings , slice of iceburg lettuce and slice of tomato.  Along with a few beers for me my wife had the in house made sangria it was not worth th $8 price.  The bartender was very detail minded friendly great service !   We will be back for dinner next time. Enjoy.",

What you can expect is excellently prepared traditional fare of a la carte items such as aged cuts, wedge salad, lobster bisque, blue cheese mashed potatoes, steamed asparagus, and creamed spinach.  Compared with Mortons and Ruth's Chris, I would pick Flemings. The service is always top notch without a bit of snootiness.  This is the only place I have been offered a BLACK cloth napkin as to not impart white fuzz onto my black skirt . I think Flemings has got their act together. I will be going to Capital Grille later this month on a business meeting so I will see if they  can top Flemings - I think they've got a good running, judging from the menu I've seen.

The shrimp simply did not taste all that good and we left some on the plate.  Maybe it is because I am from the East Coast, but I have had better.  (Much better at Mastros.

It was a little humorous as to how much worse the service could possibly get, but hey let's see.

The wife and I have probably been here more than a couple of dozen times since we've been married and we keep coming back.  There was one visit that over the years that was a little problematic, but just one, and for all the many times we've been here for outstanding meals, I can forgive that.",

The sides are additional to your $50 steak and very mediocre (hence the 4 stars) We had reservations but the place was not busy (for a Friday night) so we got seated right away. The waitress was very friendly and attentive.  If you come here, though, prepare to spend a pretty penny. It was $200+ for the two of us.",

    "text": "Flemings is my new favorite upscale steakhouse. Everything I have tried, literally everything, has been the best thing ever. Last night I took my parents here for Easter dinner. We started with the clam chowder soup, which was so creamy and chock-full of clams, we all were blown away. Next, we had wedge salads with crisp peppery bacon and the exact right amount of blue cheese.   The blue cheese dressing was a work of art.  After that came the prime rib dinner, 2 lobster tails, and filet mignon.  Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Finally, we shared two desserts: the creme brulee and the lava chocolate cake. These desserts were a perfect end to the meal with the exact right level of sweetness and a fabulous dish of chantilly cream as an accompaniment.    Our server was knowledgeable and attentive without being invasive. They also take reservations which we appreciated. Flemings is a high-end restaurant, but our meal including tip was only around $250--so it didn't break the bank. We all left full and agreeing that the meal was worth the price.",

    "text": "Let me start this review by recognizing the wonderful staff at this resturant. From the first moment you walk in until you leave, the staff is inviting,  friendly, and courteous. The dry-aged RibEye steak was cooked to perfection and was very tender. However, my host did not serve me, and there was no knife on the table to cut into this delicable slice of beef. Luckily, a passing host saw my situation and immediately came to my rescue, delivering the necessary utensil to spear this steak. The dessert was very tasty but the crust was unusually hard. I accompanied my dessert with a glass of Sambuca. I requested Sambuca black but all they had was the clear version. Traditionally this should be served with three coffee beans, but only arrived with two.  Overall, the staff and steak made up for some of these shortcomings, but this establishment is still well worth the visit. You won't be disappointed. Bon appetite!",

The bartender started off strong making me a water before I realized she had even noticed me. I had to ask for the Happy Hour menu that the hostess mentioned, and ended up ordering a glass of wine and a salad. 5 minutes later, wine arrived. I ordered the sliced filet and lobster off the dinner menu around that time. 20 minutes later, salad arrived. No napkin. Runner of the salad begrudgingly fetched me a napkin. About 30 minutes later (after I noticed both people sitting beside me sit down, order, and eat their meals) my entree arrived. No silverware. Bartender showed after a few minutes to offer silverware (no steak knife). Steak was over-cooked and under seasoned. Risotto was tasteless. Lobster had better flavor but was slightly over salted and WAY over-cooked. Extremely disappointing for a 1.5 hour stay running almost $100 for one person. Do not recommend, particularly in the midst of so many more appealing spots in Scottsdale...",

They should think about why business is off.....This may be our final time of going there.  Prime rib was almost cold, the French fries were dripping in fat and were probably fried once, and then reheated by refrying.  The hamburger was cold, along with another prime rib.  The only thing that was at proper temperature was the New York Steak.  The manager apologized, but how do 3 meals come out cold when you have someone back there that is supposed to be watching that everything comes out of the kitchen properly.  This is supposed to be a high end steak house.....don't think so.  It's happened too many times before.  Staff is weak and management isn't paying close attention.  Try another place.  Am sure it will be better.",

    "text": "Celebrated my dad's 51st birthday here on a Sunday and it was great! We all got a little tiny taste of either sparkling or red wine, and decided to share a bottle of red (currently 1/2 off!).  Our server, Sarah, was very attentive and checked with the kitchen every time I asked for an accommodation which was absolutely wonderful! My sister and I both got the prix fix menu with the filet and either shrimp, lobster, or something else I forgot about that also came with a delicious salad and hasselback potato and a dessert. I was able to switch my dessert which was great. The potato was nothing special, it was pretty much just a baked potato. I ended up getting the creme brulee which was good, but nothing so special IMO. My sister got the original dessert in the menu stated as a salted caramel ice cream sandwich which came out kind of melted and sliding off. Honestly, the presentation was horrible but she said it was still good.   Both my parents got the prime rib dinner which also comes with a salad of your choice, prime rib, a side of your choice, and a dessert of your choice. Everything was great but the chocolate lava cakes which they are apparently known for were both overcooked and were not lava-like. It was completely cooked in the middle. I guess it was soft but nothing ran out of it. I'm surprised that they didn't get the timing on the cooking down on that one.  Overall, food and service was great! It's pretty rare, though, that a restaurant messes up desserts.. those are usually the safe options! Nothing major though and I would definitely be back.",

The staff were friendly but not sensitive to the needs of the customer.  I thought that some of the dishes could have been better prepared. For instance, the calamari was served drenched in sweet and sour sauce, so it got soggy very quickly. Also, the bernaise sauce was cold and not very good, and the tarragon was so strong that the sauce tasted like licorice.  It will take a lot to have me back at this restaurant. I can think of at several other restaurants that are a better value.",

This location is much smaller than the other locations, and the noise level was actually too loud for me as this is a very special celebration for me and my date.  Both my date and I ordered the Bone-In Rib Eye steaks.  The steaks were very juicy and moist and it turned out perfect and it melted in your mouth.  Our waiter was Justin and he and his assistant were both very helpful answering our questions as this was our first time visiting this location.  We had to shout out loud to get our waiters' attention due to the noises surrounding our table. Once we finished with our meal, one of the manager, Tracy, stopped by our table to make sure their services meets our standard.  But overall, this was a great choice on both of our parts and we'll definitely return to this place again soon for another celebration.",

I stopped by since it was connected to the Hilton hotel I was staying at and wished it was open for lunch so I could of eaten there instead of the hotel lol. First things first, the bread and specialty butters were delicious. We kept ordering more. I believe it was sourdough but the creme cheese butter with herbs was sooo good.   My coworker and I were craving salmon but the only version they had was BBQ'd. Yuck. We wanted it grilled Cajun style. The restaurant customized it and it was fantastic! The perfectly, seasoned salmon was super crispy on the outside and buttery, flaky soft in the inside. They were very generous with it as well since we each got 2 fillets. I've gone before in Boston and in Los Angeles but never tried the fish. Their steaks (Delmonico is my fav) is delectable as well.  My only regret with the visit was that we were too full, probably from all the bread, that we didn't get desert. Also, be warned that this place is very expensive and will only go back if my company pays for it again or somebody sends me a gift card haha.",

    "text": "One of my favorite restaurants is Flemings Steakhouse.  My dad and I go here at least once a week because the food is absolutely amazing, and the service is wonderful.  Because my dad and I go here so often, we are on a first name basis with the manager, a couple of the hostesses, and two of the waiters.  The first thing I would like to point out is that the food is absolutely astonishing.  My dad usually gets the eight ounce filet mignon with chipotle macaroni and cheese.  He describes the steak as \"mouth- watering\" and it is outstanding.  The filet is prepared to his liking, not too pink on the inside, but not burnt at all.  The chipotle macaroni and cheese is one of his favorite sides because of the different tastes and the little spice that is added.  He says it reminds him of baked macaroni and cheese, which is his favorite food. However, I will only have a few bites of his steak once he is finished, and I usually get the Caesar salad and shrimp cocktail.  The Caesar salad is my favorite appetizer on the menu; it is not overdressed, and it is the perfect size for an appetizer.  Even though the shrimp cocktail is on the appetizer menu, I generally get this for the entree.  It is the ideal size and satisfies me.  The four large shrimp is chilled perfectly, and it is great for a smaller size entree.   Once we finish dinner, I order a couple scoops of the mixed berry sorbet, which is my personal favorite dessert on the menu.  I have always loved the mixed berry sorbet from Haagen Dazs; however, the rest of my family loves the infamous Chocolate Lava Cake.  I have heard Flemings is known for not only their steaks, but their amazing Chocolate Lava Cake.  Although I do not like chocolate, it looks to die for, and at that moment, I wish I liked chocolate. The hostesses are extremely welcoming and super sweet.  They are always asking how we are and where we would prefer to be seated.  The waiters and waitresses are incredibly polite, as well.  I love that the managers personally come to the table and ask how our meal is about ten minutes after we have received our entree. The service is always spot on and great.  The waiter we have had the most often, and we usually request to be sat in his area, is Stefan.  He is extremely nice and never messes up an order.  He is a very social person and has gotten to know my dad and I very well.  He has our orders memorized and we are in-and-out of Flemings in no more than forty- five minutes. Another fantastic aspect of the restaurant is their location.  The location of Flemings is perfect from where I live.  Flemings has two locations in Scottsdale, Pima Road and Legacy and Scottsdale Road and Lincoln; however, my dad and I usually go to the location at Scottsdale Road and Lincoln because of how much closer it is to my house.  Living down Scottsdale Road gives my dad and I more options for choosing a restaurant, yet, we choose to eat at Flemings.   This is hands down my favorite restaurant, and I would recommend it to anyone.  Although it is on the pricier and fancier side, it is fantastic for special occasions and business dinners.  The service is superb, and the waiters and waitresses are incredibly nice.",

    "text": "I haven't come up with any resolutions for 2011, so I think I will resolve to give lots of unsolicited advice to friends, family, coworkers, and the public in general...and what better way to do that than Yelp!  The little lady and I decided we would start the New Year with a nice dinner (the little lady is a vegetarian BTW, and will be referred to as \"LL\") and due to a generous xmas gift and some vegetarian options we headed to Fleming's with visions of prime steak dancing in my head.  Fleming's boasts an impressive 100 wines by the glass, which makes for a very relaxed and user-friendly wine experience.  However, I immediately saw on the way in they don't have a single beer on tap.  Craving a Stella or microbrew or something beerish this was a bit of a bummer but no big deal.  I guess I could suffer through a bottle if I had to.  We were \"greeted\" by the hostess (I've had more enthusiastic greetings at McDonald's) and then she stared down at her screen to find the reservation.  There was enough of a delay I had one of those airport/hotel/rental car type moments thinking they had lost the reservation and would be turned away or asked to sit at the bar--but luckily this wasn't the case and we were promptly seated.  I started with the vodka martini (not made as specified but fine nonetheless) and LL had some prosecco concoction with elderflower liqueur (delicious).  Service was prompt and attentive, although I had a feeling our server was either brand new or a temp called in.  She didn't even know the dressings for the salad!  As for help on wine about all she could offer was the intensity of the wine increased as you went further down the list--clearly stated on the menu.  She was also unaware of what was truly vegetarian and didn't offer up any \"super-secret-black-ops vegetarian options\".  For those that haven't had the \"pleasure\" of dating a vegetarian (not vegan thank god!) most decent restaurants will modify dishes or make up something special to accommodate--so with Fleming's it looks like the mushroom ravioli was the way to go for any True entree feel....which is fine, I realize we were at a steakhouse!  LL started with the caesar salad with ranch (traditional dressing has anchovies) and I had the french onion soup.  Both were fine, nothing to write home about.  Mine was even a bit cool of all things.  Our entrees arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  I had the main filet, and our sides included the mushrooms and Fleming's potatoes.  I have to say I was disappointed in the steak.  It was the largest filet offered, but didn't seem very impressive when it came out...and was kind of in two pieces...so not the nicest looking piece of meat I've seen.  After having a few bites I also realized it was a solid medium instead of the medium rare I had requested.  In hindsight I should of sent it back, but in reality I'm just not much of a send it back type of guy.  I guess I'm more of the eat it/don't eat it and complain about it on Yelp type of guy.  To sum things up, we had a really nice dinner and the server was extremely attentive and cheerful.  It's certainly not her fault she hasn't been properly trained on the menu--although she could of just admitted as much instead of trying to wing it!  However, for $200 with tax and tip you have to at least do what you do best: serve me up a fantastic prime cut of steak and cook it how I want it!  I know I could go to Basha's right now, buy a \"choice\" cut, and cook it properly on my POS grill with better results.  For this I'm feeling pretty generous with the 3 stars.  Happy New Year!",

I was not impressed by the Fleming potato, but LOVED the crab cake and my Bone In Rib Eye steak.   Only down fall would be the restaurant was rather loud on the night of our visit and I felt like I was at AppleBee's/ IHop and had to raise my voice periodically to be heard by my friend who was sitting next to me.   Over all happy with the place! Will go back for special occasion or good piece of steak for sure!!!",

However I had a great view of the 2 plasmas and was able to leave the sports coat in the car.  We had to wait a few moments to get a server, but once we got our server she was FANTASTIC! My wife and I have just gone thru Gastric Bypass Surgery and had a limited amount of choices to make on the menu. We both shared a bowl New England Clam Chowder. Which was THE BEST WE HAVE EVER HAD!!!! Then we ordered from the appitizer menu (Gastric Surgery has it's perks) We decided to try the Chilled Seafood Platter with Lobster,Giant Shrimp,King Crag legs, and Snow Crab. It was so fresh we barley needed any dipping sauce. We also ordered a side of grilled carrots another thumbs up! We ended up filling ourselves and had left overs to take home. Total bill came to $56.93, w Tip! We not only enjoyed the food but the atmosphere and the service. I would like to give Flemings Steak House a 2 thumbs up!

It was very good light and refreshing.  I'm more of a regular martini guy but it never hurts to try something new.  * Porcini rubbed filet mignon and peppercorn steak - both were excellent, tender, juicy and very very tasty.    * Roasted mushroom ravioli - HOLY COW!  This was amazing.  This is only an appetizer on the menu though for some reason.  I swear I had about 10 of these things.  Next time I go to Flemings I'm going to get a steak on top of a bed of these raviolis.   As always, the staff of Flemings was very friendly and helpful.  I will definitely be back.  The event we attended was through Foodies Like Us (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foodieslikeus.com&s=21e6d902235d6c5eb55b9ace6562f09f3c4cdecff11e2643cf68a1f3d643f531\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">foodieslikeus.com</a>).  It was $15 per person and well worth it for all the great food, wine and cocktails.  It was a bit too crowded though.  Anyway, it is a solid group of people that attend different dining events around the valley.  Check it out.",

Finally got my drink but had to ask again for my bf beer. Food finally got ordered and of course im not surprised it took forever to Come out. Food surprised us all on how small it was from how the waiter explained it. Got the chefs special which I can say tasted so good but was a very small amount for the price. Lava cake was delicious!

Just saying the food/drinks was amazing, is a understatement! One of our friends even said his fillet mignon was better then Ruth Chris's. Three(including me) ordered the season sampler with 3 courses, and we all got the first course all together, but my 2nd course was missing, and one the the other waiters said the kitchen miss counted, and was going to get my order in right away. After that happened the supervisor(did not catch his name) came in to check on us, and was very nice. Pretty much everyone in our group got the lava cake dessert, but I had the carrot cake and we all shared and all ended up saying the carrot cake was the best! During dessert the supervisor came back with the truffle box with a candle, the truffle box had one missing, I went to confront the supervisor, he was very sweet and got me another box and asked if i wanted a truffle for everyone in the group, i was under the impression he was going to get a plate of truffles but came back with 5 more boxes, that was very very sweet. I could not be more impressed, even down to the host that recognized me, to the bartender that really knew how to shake a cocktail. We will be returning very soon, hungry for more!",

It started with the server approaching us in the bar letting us know she would be our server once we were done with our cocktails and offering to decant some wine ahead of time.  The manager came over to introduce himself too and offered his assistance should we need it.  Once we were seated at our table the drinks kept coming all night and the service was just right, not pushy at all.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail and BBQ Shrimp for the table.  Both were outstanding and the shrimp they use are HUGE!  I ordered the larger fillet and others at the table had different cuts of meat and one person ordered the swordfish.  Everyone was very pleased with their entree.  The sides we ordered included the mac-n-cheese which was prepared with Panko breadcrumbs and toasted perfectly.  Overall an outstanding experience and we will certainly be back.",

I have never had a poor meal here trying the beautiful steaks, poultry and seafood. And for all the lovely people who can eat gluten still you must order the shoestring potatoes- they cross contaminate their friers so a no no for GF!

If you are looking for a quiet and relaxing meal, this is not the place.   Let's start with the good stuff. The complimentary bread comes out crusty and hot and the flavored spreads were delicious!  The burrata with heirloom tomatoes and arugula with a balsamic dressing was slightly overdressed, but amazing! The little hint of fresh mint in the dressing takes it over the top! The clam chowder was very good. We also had the molten lava cake and creme brulee, which were both good, but not exceptional.  Now to the big disappointment. We both had the rib eye steak, medium rare. The seasoning was good, but the outside wasn't crusted or charred enough. The cut of meat was hard to eat with bite after bite of gristle and too much fat. Overall, just a bad cut of meat!  We used to have a manager's special, a double bone-in rib eye for two (that they no longer have available...not to be confused with the one on the menu) that came out sizzling hot and crusty, and was to die for! They need to bring it back!  Their signature potatoes were good, but came out with the cheese already hardened and cold at the top. Tasted like it was made far in advance and dried out. When I cut into the cheese, the top separated like you'd expect with leftovers. The asparagus was very skinny and so tough I couldn't even cut through them with my steak knife. To their credit, our server was happy to replace it with green beans (which were very good).  Overall, we had a pleasant experience, but the main attraction fell short. Where's the beef?!!",

We decided to treat ourselves somewhere a little fancy, so we thought why not try this place. Mind you, this is both our first time trying Fleming's. We placed an order for the crab cake appetizer ($20 if I can recall) and ordered our main course (steak of course). We started chit chatting like normal, over heard a lady on the other table. she asked if they serve plastic utensils cuz she didn't like how metal felt with her teeth. The hostess replied, \"of course! you're at Fleming's. We can get you what you want\", so we saw the manager walk out and he came back with plastic utensils from the hotel. We were like, wow! So a few mins passed by and the waiter came to our table and apologized. We both looked confused as to why he apologized? He said, \"I apologize that the crab cakes hasn't came out yet\". We both said, \"oh it's ok. Don't worry about it\". He left and we both said I didn't even notice it was late. lol. A couple of mins later the manager came to our table and also apologized for the crab cakes being late. Again we said, \"ohh it's ok. It's fine, no worries\" and he left. We were like damn, even the manager apologized for that. Wow, how sweet. Then finally the crab cakes arrived and it was specially delivered to our table by the head chef! And yes, he too apologized! We were in awe by the excellent service!! The food was amazing. Meat was so tender and tasty and the mash potatoes were delicious. When the bill came, they complimented the crab cakes (which I forgot to mention was soooooo good! real crab meat). We both left pleased and with a memory we won't ever forget. :D",

I think the happy hour here must be one of the best values ever in the history of happy hours.   Our server was funny - seemingly a little distant but in actuality totally attentive and on top of every special request we had.  Our favorite was our bus boy who had the nicest manners I've ever seen on an 18 year old.  His family should be so proud of such a great young man. Wish we lived in town, we'd be regulars.  Thanks Fleming's for allowing us to enjoy a white table cloth evening while still enjoying time with our kids!",

    "text": "I am sad to say we did not have a very good experience this time. My husband and I are big advocates for Flemings but we are not so sure any more.  We visited this time to celebrate our Valentines (a little late but our job schedules don't always allow us to celebrate on the exact dates), I had made a reservation earlier in the day for 6:30 for their \"Arizona room\" since their dining room was booked. They assured me that it was heated with heaters and a fire but ill get to that... We arrived around 6:10 and let the host staff know we were there.. They already seemed pretty flustered and it was only 6pm.. We waited till about 6:35 ish till we were seated where the fans were all on, ppl at other tables were wearing their heavy coats, none of the heaters were on and the fire really didn't seem to help at all and I shivered the whole time only after asking our waitress if the fans could be turned off.  We waited for our server to come for about 15 min and than waited another 15 min for our drink orders... We finally got to order and waited at least 45 min to an hour before receiving our food. My husband ordered his fav, the filet and a baked potato (medium), however, what came out was almost done with no pink at all in the center and I ordered the pork chop with the mushrooms, it was just okay... Not better than what I could make on my grill at home!  The server finally came back to check on us and when my husband replied that his steak was just okay she must have mentioned it to the manager. He walked over, asked how our meal was and gave us a coupon for $25 off to use Feb18-March 28th...as well as removed the steak from our bill... We were glad they did something but sad that we were so excited to go to one of our fav more upscale restaurants only to be pretty disappointed.  We weren't sure if it is under new management or new ownership all together but I hope something happens fast or else most people will start to go to the other locations.",

    "text": "Courtesy of @Shwaag, I dined at Fleming's with @CaymusCabernet, @RussellOnSteak and @MarianOnWine.  I should have written this sooner, but this is my 100th review, and I wanted to reserve that spot for this.  I attended an Interactive Wine Dinner, which was an amazing event, and I highly recommend attending one.  Our evening began with an amuse of Danish Bleu Cheese and Red Onion on Flatbread. The caramelized onion contrasted with the bleu cheese was phenomenal! I think I ate about 7 of them!  This was paired with Caymus' 2008 Conundrum; a blend of Napa and central coast varietals. This was my first experience with a blended white, and I am a fan! Vanilla, melon, pear, mild acidity, really amazing.  The combination of the sweet onions, and the vanilla and citrus of the Conundrum, made for a fantastic finish. Yumm!  Out next course was an heirloom tomato salad with burrata cheese  (mozzarella), arugula, and diced beets. I'm not a fan of tomatoes by themselves, but these were delicious, hearty, and very fresh. And the spice of the arugula paired with the acid of the tomato, and the creaminess of the burrata, made for a delectable salad. I finished it off, even the beets.  This was paired with the 2007 Mer Soleil Silver Unoaked Chardonnay. Very fruity, creamy, beautiful golden wine.  Paired with the acid of the tomatoes, and the creaminess of the burrata highlights the richness of the wine wonderfully.  For the main course we were served peppercorn-crusted New York Strip with Bordelaise Sauce, Sauteed Escarole and Fingerling Potatoes. The strip was what other cuts of beef aspire to be. The preparation is what other chefs aspire to accomplish. Simplistic, subtle, yet very powerful in both mouth feel, and flavor. The escarole was topped with shaved hard-boiled egg, which was unique, and definitely changed the impact of the escarole. (I'm not particularly fond of it myself) The fingerling potatoes were perfect. The bordelaise could have been delivered in a cup and I'd have happily drank it up.  Paired with this course were two Cabernet Sauvignons; a 2000, and a 2008.  The 2008 had far too many tannins for my liking. I don't want to pucker up like I've just eaten sand and have dry mouth. The 2000 was much more mild, and was rather delicious.  Both paired wonderfully with the grilled meat, and the saltiness of the herbs on the potatoes meshed well with the reds.  For dessert we were served Berry Trifle with sour cream pundcake and amaretto mascarpone Cream. OMG. I died and went to heaven. Which I don't believe in. But almost could have.  Topped with toasted almond slivers, this dessert was pure bliss. The berries floating in the rich mascarpone, resting atop that delicious yet sinfully good pound cake.  As if that wasn't enough to knock your socks off, they paired it with a 2004 Mer Soleil Late Viognier that alone could make you think you were drinking pure sugar, with great flavor. Apricot, honey, orange, balanced acid make for a lush and long finish.  An amazing dinner and dessert, but in addition to the fantastic food, we were connected via videoconference with Chef Russell Skall; Fleming's Executive Chef, Chuck Wagner; owner of Caymus Vineyards, and Marian Jansen op de Haar; Fleming's Director of Wine. They fielded questions from several locations that were all conferenced in, making it feel a bit more personal. :)  As if all that weren't enough, one of the servers mistakenly switched my tab with another party's. That didn't really bother me, as I understand that mistakes can happen.  How it was handled made me want to reserve my 100th review for them; Mike Head, one of the Operating Partner's for the Fleming's in the Scottsdale Hilton, had introduced himself during the event, and had provided me his business card. I was expecting a deposit the night of the event, so the next morning I checked my account, which was how I noticed the disparity between my tab, and the amount my account was debited. (It was a triple digit charge) I emailed Mike, explaining the situation, and requested he contact me. Later in the day I hadn't heard from him, so I called him.  Long story less long; he was going to contact my bank and, calling as a merchant, attempt to reverse the charge. He called me back to inform me that, rather than take a chance on there being any delay in me getting my funds back, he just went ahead and took cash to my bank, and deposited it in my account.  Nobody does that. Ever.  Mike Head of Fleming's did.  He even returned my gratuity for the mistake having been made in the first place.  And after all that, they still gave me a gift card to entice me to return. Mike Head, and Fleming's of Scottsdale, epitomize what customer service should alway be about.  Thank you Fleming's, Caymus Vineyards, Chef Skall, Mike Head, and most importantly, Shwaag, for such an amazing evening.  And thanks especially to my date, for being so beautiful. :)  If you haven't been to Fleming's, do so at your earliest opportunity.",

We had 6 people that ordered the Sunday special last night and 3 of us received cold steak. In a steak restaurant of this caliber your steak should not be sitting around to the point where it comes out cold.  they took our steaks back and heated them and then the waitress and manager brought them back out. However, there was no apology, no discount, nothing. Not that we needed a discount, but al least an apology from the Manager.",

(Each $16 drinks and VERY well worth it! ) Manhatten was extrordinary!! Almost pure bourbon, lots of taste. Also could only finish 1/4 of it because of that lol but new fave!   My order was scallops and grits... literally melted In my mouth! Lighting and atmosphere was very pleasant. We came here after a very long day (18 hours) of delayed flights and driving. We were very impressed and cannot wait to stop here again in the future!  Appetizers were good... salads were fresh. Hubby got the grilled salmon and it was also done perfectly. Sliced right when you poked it.  Can you tell we loved it here??",

Once we were seated our server came by, he introduced himself and offered us a glance at the wine list, but we had to let him know that we just came from the private party were the wine was flowing, but we did order a large bottle of Acqua Panna. If God were to cry, Acqua Panna would be his tears, it's just one of my favorite bottles of water. Some great tasting bread was offered as well.  After checking out the menu I knew what I wanted. I ordered the main Filet Mignon with a steak companion of King Crab with Herb Butter topped with Caviar. We also ordering some sides, the Fleming's Potatoes & Grilled Asparagus.   Let's talk about the steak, this was definitely the star of the plate, I like my steak still pink, and this was cooked perfectly, oh and it was so smooth like butter! The king crab was the perfect side to this great steak, it picked up the flavors of the herb butter very well, and who doesn't love some caviar! This was a great steak!   The grilled asparagus was cooked just right, tender yet not too much so, can't believe I didn't like them as a child, now I can't get enough of it! The Fleming's potatoes oh they were a surprise, they are a potato au gratin style with cream, jalapenos & cheddar cheese, oh they were divine! I think potatoes should come like this all time.   We had great service, excellent dishes, l look forward to my next visit!",

    "text": "So, at the last moment, my SO and I decided we'd eat out on Thanksgiving. One of the few places still taking reservations was Flemings on Scottsdale Rd. As with most restaurants serving on Thanksgiving, it was a complete 'feast',  prix fixe. Well, I sure hope Fleming's steak is better. The Thanksgiving 'feast' was a very prepared meal, something you expect from mediocre restaurant, diner or hotel. Portions were conservative (one small plate of mashed potatoes for the table?). The soup starter, lobster bisque was actually the highlight of the meal. The turkey was sliced thinly, two dark, three white meat. It wasn't dry but it was way too salty for my taste. Reminded me more of turkey cold-cuts rather than meat off of the bird. Desert (choice of pumpkin cheesecake or apple cobbler) was nothing special and certainly prepared well in advance of the holiday. The cobbler was a mass of broken pie crust and syrupy apple preserves. On the plus side, service was pretty good considering how packed the place was. For the cost of the meal, the margins must be huge. I've had memorable Thanksgiving meals at steak houses before and this is not one of those.",

Service guy (Alex) was MIA never checked on us and the food was crap and kept apologizing all night for it.   Drove with my family from Cali to Phoenix and was staying at the Hilton's next door so we decided to swing by and eat there for the night and what a mistake that was.   It started with the bread, they brought it twice and it was returned twice for being so hard and inedible. Steak was burnt, the fries were still raw and incredibly oily, the mushrooms were watery, no flavor and over cooked... nothing was right. Not sure if the chef had a brain fart or was rushing to get home that night but he definitely made it a unmemorable experience for us.  Going to Denny's would have been better.  To cap it all off they charged me $70 for the steak and a measly Caesar salad.WOW payed the bill and left extremely annoyed.    Will never go back there or to any other Fleming's ever again.

We transitioned to the dining room, where the server was very friendly and helpful. I ordered a salad since I was a bit full from happy hour, and my husband ordered a steak. He requested it pepper crusted, and they were able to prepare it this way even though it wasn't something they offered.

    "text": "My husband and I dined here last night for his birthday and we were blown away! I had first dined at Fleming's over 10 years ago and wasn't a huge fan. At the time I felt that all of the other steak houses were better at that price point. It wouldn't have been my first choice for a special occasion dinner, but I had a gift card burning a hole in my pocket. We figured why not use it for this, and we were so glad that we did!  I had made a reservation online and noted that it was a birthday dinner. Fleming's went out of their way to acknowledge this, and really made the night a special evening. We were greeted by name when we were seated, asked whose birthday it was (nice touch 1) and given an ipad with an extensive wine list. It was fun choosing a bottle this way because you had a wealth of information regarding the flavors and notes of the wine. We were then served a complimentary warm Parmesan bread loaf with two delicious herb and brie butters (nice touch 2).   We decided to split the Caesar salad, wagyu NY strip with onion rings and the chipotle mac and cheese. They brought the salad out with two plates along with chilled forks (nice touch 3). I really enjoyed the fried capers and prosciutto in the salad. The wagyu NY strip was cooked perfectly to our asking of medium rare. The onion rings are some of the best I've had, super crispy and not surprising that this is their signature item. The mac and cheese was just as good and flavorful, very rich. For dessert we shared the carrot cake which was layered in cream cheese frosting and was served with fresh Chantilly whipped cream on the side (nice touch 4).  While we were dining, the manager visited our table and wished my husband a happy birthday. He then gave us a gift card for $25 to return (nice touch 5). At the end of the meal they brought out a complimentary box of chocolate truffles with a lit birthday candle (nice touch 6).  Summary of extra nice touches 1) Birthday acknowledgement 2) Complimentary fresh baked bread with delicious flavored butters 3) Chilled forks for the salad 4) Fresh whipped cream served on the side with dessert 5) $25 gift card to return 6) Complimentary box of truffles with birthday candle  I would not hesitate to return to Fleming's, especially for a special occasion. They really went above and beyond. I can't believe at one point they were my least favorite steak house and now they're one of my favorites! You can tell they made some great positive changes that sets them apart from the competitors.",

For the dessert the Chocolate Lava Cake is awesome being served hot with vanilla ice cream. When we first had it the price was $29 and now is pushing $40.  The Prime Rib is generally prepared exactly the way you request. Top quality meats with exceptional service.  We generally celebrate some occasion here so we have about 20 people which they give us a private room.  Important tip, buy the Flemings Gift cards at Costco.  $79 gets you $100 worth of food.  First class all the way, will be back again.",

We were there celebrating a birthday and we were greeted with a card signed by the staff and a little special gift at the end of our meal.

The meal was definitely pricey, but the steaks alone made it worth it. The sweet chili calamari was good although it quickly became soggy from the sauce. We had two cocktails. Mine the blood orange sangria, was nice and strong. I had a New York strip and my date had a ribeye. We also shared a side of asparagus and diablo shrimp. The steak melted in my mouth. I couldn't finish it all, but boy was it good. *i made steak and eggs with the leftovers. The diablo shrimp fell short in my opinion. It had no flavor. Only the sauce which did nothing for me.   It's my goal to try a different high end steakhouse every year. I've tried it so on to the next. I wouldn't voluntarily go back on my own, but if invited, I'd indulge.",

We all agreed the steaks were like \"budda\" the were so melt in your mouth.  They had some wonderful wine suggestions for with the meal.  But what I remember most was the tuna appetizer.  For some reason it just really stuck with me.    The setting is beautiful and while it was more loud than I anticipated, we could still fairly easily all 6 members of our party.    it's a bit of a drive and not exactly for the cost conscious.  So I doubt I'll be going there any time too soon on my own.  But I anxiously look forward to the return of those clients so I can enjoy all Fleming's has to offer for free.",

I've heard that the Flemings line is owned by the same company who owns Outback Steakhouse and they want to be more hands-on with Flemings. Frankly, they are ruining a really good thing.

Our server Javier was very polite, I would say he could have been more attentive but they were busy and it was a large place.  Any way, I ordered a Mojito, it was just ok. You would think for the price it would have been the best Mojito I have ever tasted. There was to much Mint and not enough anything else. It looked as though a forest was growing out of my glass. I love Mojitos and this one was by far the worst I had ever had. no appetizer because we are on a time constraint we have tickets to a show right after dinner so we hop right into ordering the main course. I ordered the Prime Ribeye, for 43.00 you would think it would be all meat right?!? nope not so much, a good 2 inches of my ribeye was pure solid fat, (not the edible kind) I was pretty upset and you would also think that for the price it would come with a side.. yep think again. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes (9.00) for a quarter of a cup of potatoes. I have to admit they were DELICIOUS! but not $9.00 for a quarter of a cup delicious. My husband ordered the Scallops. and thats just what he got, 5 scallops on a huge plate that had so much paprika on them they were red.  I myself never understand spending so much money on so little food but hey if that's what you enjoy doing where you have to hit up the drive thru on the way home because your still hungry I recommend this place.",

Ok, so we know that Fleming's beef is crazy-awesome, but the lamb chops? I have never had a better chop in my life. If you like lamb, you will loooooove this stuff. and the fleming's potatoes? probably 1 million and 2 calories in 1 cheese-laden/jalapeno-spiked bite, but hello!, totally worth it.  The medallions were quite tasty, and the scallops/risotto was superb. but nothing could even touch the lamb. seriously.",

Flemming's has a nice private room so we could here the speaker well, (downs for hosting, a little trouble with the lights and watch for next door clickers taking over your screen). The food was fabulous. Shrimp cocktail, interesting butters and bread, red onion walnut cranberry salad:  pretty standard. Then things became interesting. My favorite kind of mac and cheese coating in panko bread crumbs, perfectly cooked and seasoned asparagus, and melt in your mouth filet mignon. I did not think I would be able to eat another bite but out came a huge slice of I believe white chocolate cheesecake with a berry sauce. Amazing! I wanted more sauce but that was not enough to stop me from cleaning my plate. Why isn't there free CE's with fantastic dinners that allow over eager dental students every night???",

Food - we all ordered steaks that were cooked perfectly - sides are ordered separately and are quite large - example the potato I ordered loaded was the size of regulation football - I easily could have split this monster with the wife. Couple of notes: pricing on the high side - would only stop in here for a special occasion, wine pouring per glass was less than I expected, noise level in the place can get loud - not  a deal breaker - however this should be mentioned - overall from start to finish they get A's in my book.",

While the prime rib, side dishes (Sauteed Mushroom and Asparagus) and dessert (molten lava cake) were very good, I was disappointed in the customer service.",

Extremely tasty with great flavor.   Probably the most tender one I have ever had.    Definitely on my go back list.",

Lois and I both had the Flemings house salad with lemon vinaigrette that was crisp and the dressing just the right amount of acidity and lemon flavor. We each chose the small plate, Lois had the braised short rib that was almost like a pot roast on a bed of spinach. I chose the small plate of shrimp and scallop scampi served on a bed of squash vermicelli. Excellent. We really went all out and had their creme brulee with Chantilly cream. Fresh berries on top. I can't say enough about our meal. Oh and not to forget the hot loaf of bread with two flavored butters, champagne infused and smoky cheddar. Our servers were very attentive. Carmen and Javier you were fantastic!  Thanks for the hospitality.",

    "text": "We visited Fleming's on a Thursday evening, after making 7:15pm reservation via their website.  The place was absolutely packed, a great surprise.  When we arrived early, we did have to wait for our table to be ready (to be expected), and had a chance to sample their \"5 for $6\" Happy Hour drink menu, which stops at 7:00pm.  The Manhattan and Peach Sparkler were quite good for only $6 each.  While waiting, we used the iPad wine menu to explore the many, many wine selections that would be available to us at dinner.  Once seated for dinner, we had fantastic service from our servers, who were always attentive and helpful throughout the meal.  Their homemade bread and butters were great for a start while waiting for our orders.  Instead of wine, we went with the special Pomegranate and Sage Margarita, which was delicious.  For food, we decided to order their Seasonal Menu, a wonderful 2-course taste sensation starting with Lemon Ricotta Crostini with Fresh Pear Slices for an appetizer, and then an Iron Seared Delmonico Steak with tangy bearnaise butter and spiced blue crab topping.  It also came with a crisp potato cake and heirloom carrots.   Unfortunately, one of our steaks was not cooked as well done as ordered, and had to go back to the kitchen.  The resulting extra/twice-cooked steak was disappointing at best.  This is the only black mark on an otherwise excellent dining experience.  To Fleming's credit, the manager came over to the table to apologize, without our asking, and did offer to remove the entire 2-course meal charge off the bill for the steak preparation mistake.  You really can't ask for anything more.  Mistakes do occasionally happen, and they really stepped up and took care of us when it did.  Other than this little problem, I would have rated them a full 5 stars!",

Our waiter Jason was amazing, warm and friendly and so very knowledgeable; he had great suggestions. We enjoyed the 2 choices of butter with the bread and probably ate more bread than we should have. The modern caesar is delicious especially with the dried prosciutto chips and my husband enjoyed the huge, new wedge. We both had the 16 oz. dry aged seared rib eye both ordered medium rare. I felt my steak was cooked perfectly but my husband's was a little more towards medium but both of us thought the steaks were delicious and tender. We also had the brussel sprouts which are amazing and the chipotle mac and cheese was probably one of the best we've had in a long time; very cheesy with a wonderful panco crust. For dessert we shared the chocolate molten lava cake and requested the salted caramel ice with it instead of the vanilla since the caramel is so very good. and it went great together. It was warm with lots of rich chocolate pouring out from the inside, topped with their chantilly creme.  They have an extensive wine and spirits list with some hard to find items. this was certainly a much better experience than our last visit but I can definitely say again that their customer service is the very best. Our waiter was so sweet that before we left he gave us a box of their truffles to take home which were very good. I think the one we enjoyed the most was the smores truffle. A very enjoyable night.",

    "text": "I was looking forward to a great experience and a great meal.  I was by myself and decided to eat at the bar.  Upon entering I was greeted by a friendly hostess who I asked if I could go to the bar and she said yes, it's open seating.  She could have walked me over if she really wanted to impress, but hey...  Upon entering the bar, I was quite disappointed with the ambiance or lack thereof.  When you go to a nice steakhouse especially the bar, you don't expect it brightly lit and plainly decorated - plain painted walls and poorly positioned tv's that were not large enough to view from where they were positioned way off to the far corners of a very tall ceiling.    You expect hip and fashionable with good music and vibe.  Especially when you ar paying $10 and up per drink...  The night was more of a disappointment from there.  I was given a menu and a wine menu but never asked if I wanted to order a drink.  I finally had to ask the bartender, a guy on the shorter side, not that it matters, who seemed to be too busy socializing with the waitresses and staff than to consider my drink order.  I will say he was a friendly guy and I can see why he was so popular with the staff b/c all he did was socialize with them over and over again.    Ultimately, he suggested the petite filet over the Scottish Salmon which he said was wild caught.  I went with his suggestion and asked for it medium which he said would be pink in the middle which I said was fine.   I also ordered the tomato salad w/beets and was disappointed with the arugula as it appeared a bit wilted and the tomatoes were not chilled which they need to be to make this salad good.  Same with the room-temp beets.  Dressing was decent.  I was working on my salad when the female bartender came over to me and asked me if I was done with my salad which I clearly was  not.  It was awkward b/c my steak was ready as one of the servers had come out and told her as I could see them conferring off to the side of the bar.  I told her I would be ready in a couple of mins and then realized that I should have probably just let them bring it out.    After finally getting her attention back, I asked to have it brought out.  Five mins later I was presented with a petite filet that clearly had been sitting on a hot plate and under a heat lamp as it was quite dry.  It also was a disappointing cut and had some fat on one side which I have never experienced before at a fine steakhouse...disappointing to say the least.  I also ordered the sauteed spinach with oil, no butter and that was pretty good.  There were red onions in it which I typically don't like, but these were well-cooked and seasoned to my liking so I ate them.  I had asked for a glass of Pinot Noir to accompany my steak and he recommended a glass of the PREDATOR Zinfandel Lodi Old Vine, 2012/13.  It was hugely oaky and frankly the most overbearing red I have ever had.  I asked him to smell the bouquet or even try a sip.  It's then that he admitted he had never tried it.  Why would he recommend something he had never tried.  The wine was terrible so he poured me a glass of the Syrah which was much better.  I looked at a menu nearby and saw that Flemings is part if a broader chain and then realized what I was dealing with.  It is their highest end brand I believe and I don't think it is being closely watched from the corporate offices; at least not this one.  I finished my meal and the plates sat there for a good 20 mins without being cleared.  This is at the bar, mind you where the staff is basically on top of you by design.  I finally asked him for a refill on my water and 5 mins later he filled it for me after taking care of several other customers first.  On the positive side, the waiter suggested I not try the Chocolate Lava Milkshake since I told him I had to be up at 4 a.m. the next morning and had a trip to Hawaii  planned the following month.  With just that advice  I avoided a hangover as well as likely close to 10,000 calories.  He scored back some points for that one.  All in all, a lot of money for a average meal with no ambiance...likely wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend it until managment instills a higher level of professionalism in the staff.",

Only to be told by the hostess that the chef saw my request and did not have any time to go get any puffed pastry for the day so I was out of luck.  (Keep in mind I was told at the time of reservation that only this Flemings location which is one of two in Phoenix could prepare Beef Wellington at the tine I made my reservation).  They then said they tried to call me but there was no anssr?!.  Ooops on that lie.. the number they had was the Westin Kierland Resort open 24/7 and so someone would have answered if they only tried.  Now it is 545 and I am on the hunt for Wellington.",

Ranch only a few more minutes away. For $29.99.  We had been frequent diners at the Scottsdale Road location but from now on we'll go to D.C. ranch. If you use the Flemings brand you should honor the promotions.",

    "text": "We've been to Fleming's probably 50 times over the past several years.  Obviously we like this restaurant; the food, atmosphere and service.  I've written previous reviews but never one for Fleming's, which is my fault.  I've read the previous reviews and must admit this place wouldn't be highly recommended for vegetarians or vegans - it's primarily a steakhouse, by definition.  I rarely buy steak at home (because my doctors think I'm on a low-cholesterol diet), but I do love steak.  Fleming's has excellent steak, meat and fish dishes.  We've been to several Fleming's locations in the Phoenix area; they're all good.    [Note:  The previous reviewer's comments are perhaps in the wrong location because they basically reviewed Paul Martin's American Grill.  Paul Martin's full name is Paul Martin Fleming.  His current restaurant is Paul Martin's but he has a long and successful history.  He created Fleming's Steakhouse but sold it years ago to Outback.  He also founded P.F. Chang's China Bistro (P.F. = Paul Fleming), Z'Tejas Southwestern Grill, and Pei Wei Asian Diner, all of which he sold.  As best I understand Paul Martin's is currently his only undertaking.  He was also formerly an investor and involved with Ruth's Steakhouse.]   We absolutely love all their food.  They offer an absolutely fabulous \"happy hour\" with appetizer's and hamburgers (which isn't by any means hamburger), and discounted drinks.  What a great introduction to Fleming's for those that have never been here before.  One of the things we particularly like is their bread.  As soon as you sit down they bring you warm freshly baked bread with some wonderful spreads.  If you want more, just ask and they'll bring another small loaf, but be careful because if you eat too much you won't get through your meal.  We rarely order their \"sides\" because we're not big eaters, but they are all terrific.  The one thing I never pass up is their wedge salad; a wonderful salad.  On rare occasions we've had some of their desserts, which are fabulous, but fattening.",

I showed up during Happy Hour and sat at a booth at the bar.  They had a nice menu for happy hour which included a burger for like $8 which was wonderful, for the money.  Heck, you spend $8.00 at McD's now and this burger was hands down the clear winner.  Cooked to perfection, cheese and bacon and all the fixings.  I also had a bowl of French onion soup.....which was good but served pretty much boiling hot where it took forever for it to get cool enough for me to eat it.  It was busy at that bar, not in the restaurant since it was so early and I can't understand what took so long for them to bring me my burger.  It was well over 30 minutes and I had to chase the waitress down for it.  This was the only downfall of my visit.",

We do eat fish on rare occasions (so technically pescetarian), but I primarily cool entirely vegan at home, which is most of our meals.  We received a Fleming's gift card for Christmas, so made Open Table reservations to check it out.  We were immediately seated at a large booth.  The service was spot-on for our dinner.  Our waiter was attentive, but gave us our space as well.  We had a couple of glasses of wine, which were fine.  We didn't order anything special, as we have nicer bottles at home which makes it tough to want to spend a ton of $$ one wine at a restaurant.  We ordered the Jumbo lump crab cakes as an appetizer.  These were great.  Maybe not the BEST I've ever had, but right up there.  Next, we split the Heirloom Tomato and Homemade Burrata salad.  This was also nice - not overly dressed and quite simple.  I wasn't all that hungry, so we decided to split two small plates.  We ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna and the New Bedford Scallops.  We also had a side of the Fleming's Potatoes.  First, the potatoes did NOT go with the food at all.  That is probably our fault for ordering them, but our waiter highly recommended them.  The potatoes were good, but very rich and the flavors were quite overpowering when compared to the fish.  Both fish dishes were great - we liked the Tuna better than the scallops.    Overall, we had a good meal.  Will we be back?  Probably not.  While the food was good, it was also quite expensive and not really our typical style.  This seems like a great date restaurant or somewhere to take someone you want to impress.",

Service was a little better, but still not the service you would except and that we usually receive at a prime steakhouse restaurant.

There were about 25 people and we were there for over 3 hours. Chef talked about cuts of steaks, characteristics, cooking methods, and wine pairings. We had 3 uncooked steaks at our table and those were taken back to the kitchen and cooked to perfection. Each table got a platter of steaks (rib eye, filet, and strip- one of each), sliced, and ready to eat. We also had pourings of 3 wines - 1 for each steak. It was fantastic and quite informative. We will definitely sign up for future classes and continue to dine at the restaurant.",

We had a couple martinis and ordered mushroom soup, kale and roasted vegetable salad, soy- ginger scallops and a filet. Our waiter was very busy but made us feel like we were the only ones there.

We were delighted to discover a gourmet menu that includes lamb lollipops, beef tips in an elegant wine sauce, shrimp scampi, as well as creative burger choices.  We stuffed ourselves on the lamb chops, beef tips, spicy tater tots, and shrimp scampi.  Every dish was perfectly prepared.  The service in the bar is as attentive and gracious as in the main dining area.  I don't think any bar in town offers as fine a menu as Fleming's, and as nice an ambience.",

    "text": "On Easter, our family normally goes out for a steak dinner.  This year, we decided to try Flemings, after receiving a few gift cards over the Holidays.  We made reservations weeks in advance, which is something I would recommend btw.  We arrived on time and were seated within a few minutes.  We found it to be a treat to be seated near the kitchen.  The food at Fleming's was good, but the service was somewhat disorganized.  In upscale steak houses, your server is always watching to see if you need anything and is very much on top of things: topping off glasses and getting a sense of timing on when to bring things out.  Here, even with four Culinary Managers walking around, our server was gone for long stretches of time.  Our two glasses of wine took fifteen minutes and our salads were completely forgotten.  Our server only caught the error just before our Entrees arrived.   Our meal ran in the low twos, as you would expect for a party of three, or about $70 each, not including gratuities or taxes.  Our three course Prime Rib (photo) dinner ran $40.95 seemed about right, as was their Double Breast Chicken was $34.95.  We also ordered the Macaroni & Cheese Lobster (photos), Creamy Spinach, Spicy Habanero Skillet Potatoes for the table.   It was inevitable that during dessert, we started comparing Fleming's to our other Easter dinners.  The consensus was that Flemings was: \"Three Stars, A-Okay, with no je ne said quo.\" when compared to other places nearby.  Sorry!",

The lobster was a little tough in parts & a little mushy in parts, but tasted really good. The S & T came with salad and desert which I shared with my wife. The salad was what you would expect but the key lime pie was to die for. My wife got a Chardonnay while I knocked down two Manhattans. 15 bucks a pop, but fabulous. The cherries ware candied. Service was excellent. Waiter let my friends wife sample wine before she committed. Now, let's face the facts. The bill was $156.67 after tax and before tip. I left 20% which brought the total to $186.67. We're talking 10% of my social security check. Thank heaven I had two $50.00 gift cards. We could have gone to Black Angus, Outback or a cowboy restaurant and got much better value for my hard earned money. I would love to go back but just can't afford it.

HH is only in the bar and patio, and when we got there at 6:00, the only reason we got a place to sit was cause some people got up and left.   Otherwise, what?    Even though the place was packed, we could have a decent conversation without shouting at each other, which I appreciate the acoustics.  Hannah was our server and I can't remember who assisted her.   Both very efficient and professional.    I had the 14 Hands cab on the HH menu.   Most HH wine is UGHHHH!!! and I usually end up getting something to drink off the non HH menu.  The 14 Hands was good.  In fact, good enough that I looked to see if it was sold in town.   It is. And it is inexpensive.  And, yes, I shall buy it.  We perused the HH bar food.  Hmmm.  Both of us were hungry; therefore, we both had the burger and shoestring fries.   The beef patty came topped with two yummy strips of bacon and a slice of tomato and enough iceberg lettuce for a salad.  We both put our buns aside and ate the burger, bacon, and salad/tomato and lettuce.     The burger was, well, a burger.   Nothing special about it.   The shoestring fries were, well, shoestring fries.   It was good.    I would go back to try their other food.   If it was based only on the burger and fries, I'd give it three stars.   With the atmosphere of being able to hold a conversation without shouting and the efficiency and friendliness of our server and her helper, and the fact they don't have some sort of cheap rot gut wine on the HH menu, I'll give it a four.   I think they should be more creative with their fries.  The other option was onion rings.   I saw what appeared to be two huge onion rings on other guests' plates, and I am assuming that was the onion rings.   No, thank you. ...",

We all had steaks, they did not disappoint even though my husband's steak had to be returned to the kitchen 3 times. Ordered medium plus and it was rare. The nice thing is that they gave us another steak which we took home and made an adjustment on the bill. The wedge salad is huge and can be shared as can the giant loaded baked potato. One person in our party had the flemings potatoes which are like au gratin with cheese on top. The spinach and mushrooms were tasty. Service was top notch.

Some colleagues and I stopped in one evening without a reservation and had to wait about 10-15 min for a table of eight. After being seated our server was very prompt and helpful. This being many of our first time here, our server was very patient and willing to spend the few extra moments with us to discuss the many items on the menu that we were interested in. Awesome drink menu and plentiful selection of brews. The appetizers we got were amazing!  After finishing the amazing steak and sides I was more than satisfied with my choices. The next option was dessert... Oh boy!? After thinking about it long and hard I did pass on the dessert as I was stuffed after my main course. Some of my friends do still joke with me as the server asked me if I wanted deep fried filet migon with ice cream. I was sure that the server was serious and it appeared that they would make basically anything we wanted.  After paying the bill and complementing our server to his boss we were all thoroughly impressed. Next time I'm in the area, I will definitely be stopping by for another amazing steak!",

Presentation was great, it had a full piece of bacon and a block of blue cheese. For the main course I decided to go with the Filet and flight special. I had the filet with the peppercorns and then Oscar styled. The steak was cooked to perfection, so perfect I almost didn't even need a knife. I left very full and happy. I absolutely recommend!",

I've been here three or four times in the past few years and never really had any bad experiences. Was comfortable in jeans and a polo. We started off with the calamari, which was cooked perfectly but I wasn't big on the sweet sauce it was served in. Seemed a little cheesy for a higher end steak house. She ordered the Wagyu strip and I had the dry aged ribeye, along with truffle mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. The cook was a perfect medium rare, the steaks themselves were decent... I'm a tough critic as I cook a lot of steaks, all higher end cuts of beef from local butcher shops (Hobe, Midwestern Meats, AJ's, etc). The creamed spinach was great, wish the truffle mashed potatoes had real truffles instead of truffle oil. Loved the bread with the champagne brie butter.",

I had two bites. gave it to my dogs. for the money I could cook up food 5 times better.  and have.  asparagus was hard too. the potatoes were ok. if you wanna spend 150 on 2 star food then this is your spot. but this place could use some new cooking",

Ambiance is rich, service is Downton Abbey-like, food is something from a cooking show.  My filet mignon was perfect. The scallops only lacked for bacon. Those Fleming's potatoes were wicked good.  And I broke a 30-day diet to mangia on Chocolate Lava Cake, which was the closest thing food comes to sex. Holy crap that was good. Seriously.  The whole staff was impeccably mannered and quite kind. Our waiter put up with my aging parents who don't hear too well.  It ain't cheap, but damn, it's good.",

    "text": "I would have to rate Fleming's as my favorite Chain Prime Steakhouse! Especially once you start receiving coupons and invitations via email it makes Fine dining somewhat more affordable (if that even goes together) LOL! A discount on $100 dinner helps out. I would definitely recommend them over a few other well-known Fine Dining Prime Steakhouses for a special occasion.   I absolutely love the flavor of the Filet Mignon so tender and buttery and they have the perfect balance of salt & pepper seasoned on there I try to cut the pieces as small as possible so it will last as long as possible. Their sides are great too the macaroni & cheese, creamed corn, and potatoes are great. The creme Brule & cheesecake are my favorite desserts.   The Service is great too even better if you go on a weeknight cause it is quieter more romantic for a special occasion without the background noise, everything is so clean, they servers are very knowledgable on the menu the way things prepared and perfect wine pairings for what you're eating.   My biggest complaint is they discontinued my favorite cocktail it was like sweet but had a spicy bite to it cause the bartender drops a little tabasco sauce in there so every time you take a sip it gives you a kick! OMG it was awesome I went back and they said they no longer have the main ingredient for it Mango Puree so they had to discontinue it NOOOO!",

I had a new york strip medium rare, which was perfectly cooked, and also very well seasoned.  You don't need much more than that, but that's what you need.  The chipotle cheddar mac and cheese was also spectacular - smoky with a bit of heat and nicely coated in thick creamy cheesy deliciousness.  Not quite as stellar: the creamed spinach was a little too creamy, being basically more cream than spinach.  Also, the seafood tower; it had some pretty excellent items  like the jumbo shrimp and the king crab leg, but it was extremely light on the lobster and the lump crab salad was bland and subpar.  A couple other notes: They have some really tasty homemade butter spreads they serve with the breadbasket.  The place looks great inside, and the service was excellent with the only hiccup being a long wait for our first cocktail.  My only other complaint would be the wine list; there are plenty of bottles in the $30-40 range but most of them are from the cheap aisle at your grocery store.  You're gonna have to shell out $50+ to find something that really stands up to your red meat.",

Our waiter, Jose, was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable, but not an overbearing presence.  The rest of the wait service was also very good.  The food was cooked to perfection.  The Strip steak that I had was one of the best, if not the best, I have ever had (and yes, I have eaten at Durant's).  I had mine done medium rare and seared while my son had his Strip steak medium rare and broiled.  My wife had the small Filet done medium rare.  Both stated that their food was equally as good as mine.    Do not expect a fast paced meal.  One of the pleasures is that it was served at a leisurely pace allowing for the total enjoyment of what was being served.  We had drinks, the entrees, and we shared a wonderful fruit and cream dessert and we where there for over 90 minutes.  The environment was subdued and reasonably quiet.  The other guests' conversations did not intrude upon ours.    All the employees, from the manager (who came to our table after we had told Jose how much we enjoyed our meal and service) to the greeter who open the door for us were friendly and seemed genuinely pleased that we had decided to visit their establishment.  One of the assistant manager even took my wife's arm and helped her to the restrooms when asked where they were.  Could not have asked for more.",

I called to make reservations in the morning and wasn't able to get in until 8pm (fine by me). First off, the bread was delicious (came with 2 types of butters). For appetizer, we had the carpaccio-it was a full plate of it with pieces of toasted bread on top! For the entree, we both had filet mignon. Mine came with the Fleming's potatoes (A MUST TRY). His came with crab stuffed shrimp and asparagus. For dessert we ordered the chocolate lava cake! OMG this was sooo good. I'm so glad we ordered this and it definitely satisfied my sweet tooth!! This place also has a large wine list--bottle prices were from  the $30's to $600's. If you don't finish it, they cork it and seal it in a bag for you to take home. Because it was my boyfriend's birthday, the manager gave him a $25 giftcard for next time. In addition, every staff member we talked to said happy birthday to him (I mentioned it was his birthday when I made the reservation over the phone). Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable on the food & wine as well. What amazing service and staff! The only negative thing for me would be the noise-but it was only because it was so busy!  Overall, this place is worth every penny! Thank you Fleming's...we will be back again!",

With the prices they had this must be the best steak I have ever had, right? Wrong! This small sliver of peppered meat was far from what I expected. I get better steaks from the market. After our waiter comes for the 3rd time during our 90 mins waiting, he was too busy taking pictures for those wealthy looking people, I get the check dropped on me and no questions on how the food was, or if we needed anything.

No big deal though, the hostess was able to get us seated quickly. Then again it was a Wednesday night so it wasn't too crowded.   Service: Our server was extremely attentive without seeming pushy and annoying, perfect. We were also greeted by the manager which was nice and each person that stopped at our table to help was efficient and polite.   Ambiance: Perfect lighting, bathrooms were clean, almost ate shit in my heels because the floor was either just waxed or slippery as hell. Oh well. Noise level was perfect, not eerily silent but also not too loud.   Food: We both ordered the filet and lobster 3 course special and it really hit the spot. We started out with an amuse-bouch of scallop on a bed of something I don't remember and cherry tomatoes. It was delicious. Then I got the wedge salad, I should have gotten dressing on the side but I wasn't thinking at the time. Too much dressing freaks me out. Oops again. The main course came out shortly after and my steak was cooked perfectly to my order. My boyfriend's steak was a little undercooked but it was no big deal. Lobster was also fantastic, our server de shelled our lobsters for us. Perfect. I couldn't finish my steak but I did manage to snatch the rest of my boyfriend's lobster, yay! Then came the desert of my dreams. I had the deconstructed s'mores and it was to die for. The marshmallow was perfectly fluffy and with the scotch in the chocolate, it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. I would actually come back every day just to get this for my sweets fix.   Price: We had an amazing deal, but seriously, don't come here if you're not willing to put your wallet to work.   Overall, great service, ambiance, and food.   P.S. Writing this as I finish the rest of my s'mores.",

My lobster was pretty good, but didn't taste as sweet as Maine lobster. I can tell the difference. Our service, as always, was most excellent.   Disappointing to have two 3-star steaks at $45 each. Boo.",

Walked in person with no reservation and they told me that they were booked for the night but yet there were tons of tables with nobody sitting at them.  I go sit in my car and look them up online and they have reservations available.  When I called about making a reservation they had no problem whatsoever getting a seating.  I chose to go somewhere else.  If you can't have enough integrity to be honest to my face about coming to your place of business and lie to my face about being able to eat there, then I won't be eating there ever and I doubt my friends will either!  To top it off they don't allow firearms either.  I would rather eat somewhere that has integrity to their customers instead of being lied too directly to my face.  Honesty is pretty important in my opinion especially if it a place of business.",

Their wine list is presented on an iPad, and rightfully so - it is gigantic.  We split the caesar salad which was great and even a small was easy to share.   Since I wasn't super hungry, I ordered the scallops. Four midsized scallops in a delicious meyer-lemon honey glaze. The side of vegetables were fabulous as well. I had a few bites of my husband's ahi tuna which was also excellent.  I'll definitely return - looked like they had a great happy hour menu as well!",

Large restaurant but has a warm feel.  My most event visit I took my staff out for a team dinner, the place was buzzing and packed. I would suggest you to make reservations but I'm sure that they take walk-ins you just may have to wait a bit longer to be seated.  The steaks were cooked to perfect temperature, I got the large filet and the sides...damn. The sides are all bomb particularly the potatoes Au gratin and the lobster Mac. The portions are meant to be shared family style.  I've not had the dessert here, I've always been too dang full from the main course. ",

Service in the bar was very good sometimes it can be hit or miss. I got the prime burger not very original but I was in the mood, burger was just fine cooked a little more than medium as requested but it wasn't an issue for me, fries of course delicious. I could not go to Fleming's and just get a burger so I ordered the crab cake appetizer to accompany my meal. Good crab cakes for in the middle of the desert so I can't complain. My partner got the double breast of chicken with white wine mushroom thyme and leek sauce. He said the pieces of chicken were good but the sauce was eh. Definitely will be back at one location or another.",

The glasses were so chilled the glass was ice-frosted. Immmm... We moved on to a have a few bites from the HH menu, Burrata, mushroom-farro burger and a California burger. The HH menu is frequently tweaked to accommodate a sense of newness you'll never be bored with happy hour here. I've probably had 8 HH visits in the last 12 months and it's always stellar. A notable item, with the burgers came a side of french fries, they dipped/rolled a few olives in batter and tossed them in the fryer with the fries, a spin off of deepfried pickle.  The final notable mention goes to the service, it has never been less than exellent. Waitstaff has has always been well thought, well timed and on the ball. Every time I've visited a member of the management has stoped at the table to greet and inquire as to satisfaction. what's worth noting, is the timing. They always seem to greet you when its convenient, and not while your chewing.",

Drinks, Starters, Entrees... all to die for. The melt in your mouth can't get enough of kind. And surprisingly we didn't feel stuffed or have lots of food left over. Our Server Sara Flanagan made all the difference.  She answered all of our questions, assisting us, making recommendations when we asked and guiding us every step of the way. This allowed us to make the right selections and I will say I'm really impressed when I'm dining and the Server gives us her business card. How Professional and wish I could give Ten Stars! Two drinks each, two starters, two Entrees and bread and Without dessert. We spent $140 with tip (after our $100 gift card), so plan to spend some money.

    "text": "Great steaks, but extremely pricey so bring your checkbook.  We had $100 in gift cards to Fleming's so after visiting the Scottsdale Art Walk recently we decided to stop in for dinner. The food was delicious, but like all upscale steak houses, everything is a-la carte. Steaks are $50 and up and your sides start at $12 and go up from there. We started with an appetizer of calamari, then I had a bone-in ribeye and my wife had the New York strip. For sides we had the brussel sprouts and bacon and the lobster mashed potatoes. Because it was a Thursday night, my wife stuck with water and I had one IPA. I will say that everything was delicious and very well prepared and the service was excellent.  However, the whole setting was very generic. Fleming's is locally owned, but if you'd blindfolded me I couldn't have told you if I was in a Morton's, Ruth's Chris or Capital Grille. Even the beer selection was generic. Yes, they carry a lot of wine, but how about offering some local craft beer as well? My IPA was a Sam Adams Rebel which is decent, but something I could find anywhere.  I also take issue with how much they charge just to cook a piece of meat. Yes, I realize that's how steakhouses work, but when I'm paying that much for food I like to know that the chef actually worked to put ingredients together.  So how much was it? Well after tip our $100 gift cards barely covered half of the bill. I can't even imagine what it would be if we had ordered more drinks or a bottle of wine.  Sure, this is a great place if you're on an expense account or just want something generic, but I also appreciate the experience so next time I want a steak I'll choose Durant's or The Stockyards.",

We dined on a Monday and most in our family had the special - Filet & Lobster for $55 (or $57 for crab?  I think...).  The steaks were perfectly Medium Rare, seared and seasoned well.  The Lobster was also quite good and included drawn butter.  Salad and dessert were included.  Everything was excellent, as one would expect from Fleming's.    The highlight of our meal, however, was the service.  Having waited tables in the past, I know that showing up at a fine dining establishment - with both a toddler and older parents (who like to share everything) and then ordering the special -  can illicit anything from an eye roll to lackluster service.  Not so this evening.  Our server, Andria, and the manager, Chris, were beyond hospitable.  They were charming and kind and patient.  We felt truly cared for and we are grateful.  We will be back!",

The food is always great and very hot when it comes out.  I love steak so it is always right up my alley.  This past Sunday's experience fell short.  Our waitress, although nice, was not attentive and did not listen to what we had to say.  We ordered an appetizer and needed it prepared in a certain way, but it did not come out as we ordered.  We saw our waitress all of three times the entire night.  My girlfriend ordered a bottle of wine which was on the \"last call\" list.  We waited 20 minutes before she came to tell us that the bottle was not available.  The busboy that was associated with our waitress might as well have been our server.  He was great.  He made sure everything was to our liking and even refreshed my girlfriends wine glass.    When the food did arrive, we were satisfied with it.  The two times that we have been, the food is always exceptional.  But, you can't help but notice the lack of service.  I have to say it did affect our time there on Sunday, but won't hold us back from coming back.  We can only hope that the service will be better the next time.",

First we got seated and the guy didn't pull out our chairs and just handed us the menu. Our server ignored us for 10-15 minutes literally avoiding eye contact. Finally got some water and biscuits. When ordering I asked \"which is better this or..\" Then he cut me off and told me oh yes get that one. Pretty unfriendly and made a big deal about substituting a side. Kind of grabbed the menus and left awkwardly.   The food came and was very good. The runner kind of threw the plate down and some actually went off the plate and he said \"oh it's slippery\". We kind of laughed it off but still... Everything added up to not be service you expect at a nicer restaurant.   The waiter started warming up a bit towards the end but still pretty awkward.   Went to tell the manager on the way out about the rough start and his response was that he'd have to talk to the waiter and get his side of the story. Weird response considering we'd already paid and were walking out. We weren't asking for a refund or anything. I expected a \"sorry for that bad start\" and instead had him say he doesn't believe us. Again very awkward.",

I had the porcini mushroom sauce on the side and OMG!  Such a great combo with the chop!

Unfortunately, i have to cut this review short but the creme Brule is also to die for!  The only reason why i didnt give it a 5 star is that they sat us under a ac grate and it was too cold sitting BUT the manager did take care of that.  Great job Flemings!",

Reservation at 6:30 on a Saturday night in the private room section, a perfect seating for us as it was much quieter. Our dinner consisted a shared plate of calamari, two petite filet with a side of grilled asparagus and sauteed mushroom.   Calamari plate was very big, pre-mixed with the hot n sour (though it says hot and sweet) sauce, not the typical calamari I had tried, especially there were sauteed red pepper, onions and some very sour jalapenos. Overall it was ok, the outside layer of calamari isn't as crispy as I wanted, probably because it was already mixed with sauce.  Now to the main dish, steak!! We both opted for the petite size, it was perfect for us, very well accompanied by the grilled asparagus and sauteed mushrooms. My medium rare filet came out very nice and juicy. If only my mom doesn't eat her steak at well-done, i would have ordered a bigger steak to share (of course to save money too!) oh well, we both only want what we like :p  For dessert, we chose the famous lava cake. Well, it came out very neat looking with two scoops of ice cream and a little candle, but the cake itself was a bit too bitter for me, it was very very dark chocolate. I normally do like dark chocolate, but this lava cake, if no ice cream was accompanied, i don't know how many bites I could take.   Our overall experience was great, very nice staff and attentive services! And because we went for birthday, yay for a $25 gift card for the next visit !!",

We are such food people that when it comes to going out and spending money on a good steak, we love it. We have been to Roy's, Mastro's, City Hall... you name it!  So we decided to give Fleming's a shot. We were so incredibly disappointed. The food was decent, Id say a little over price for the quality, but the service... oh goodness.  Not to say that my fiance and I are prim and proper, but we do live a luxurious life style and appear like we do as well . (meaning we don't dumpster drive then try to act classy in public). The waitress made us feel like we did not belong there what so ever! Such a strange feeling! I'm not sure if she was tired of being a server or what, but it was bad. It left me feeling like a loser... We could not get out of there fast enough, more like she could not get us out of Fleming's fast enough..   regardless, to say we probably will not come back is an understatement. Plus with the people that we know, my fiance and I will definitely advise them to choose a different option.   End of rant....",

It was a great opportunity to try several of Fleming's offerings at once, and  to pair them with different wines as well. The wines were all lovely and the dishes that Fleming's offered for the event blew me away! We had a variety of excellent cheeses, always a great way to flatter excellent wines. Sweet chile calamari had a very pleasant sweet tangy sauce that lightly coated the tender squid. The roasted mushroom ravioli featured a delicious porcini butter sauce coating pasta pillows stuffed with portabello and shiitake -- a must-try for all mushroom lovers. We also had steak crostini,  melt-in-your-mouth tenderloin carpaccio, seared ahi tuna -- all excellent. The wine tasting event turned out to be a superb dining experience as well.",

The scalloped potatoes were excellent.  Cons: Everything is overpriced, and it is not the quality you'd expect. A decent cut of steak is $55+ and a la carte. I tried the pork chop ($37 and a la carte). The waitress recommend having it cooked medium, which I ordered. When it arrived, it was well undercooked (cold rare). The manager took it back and cooked it appropriately. Taste was okay but it was not at the level of a $37 a la carte cut (I could have cooked this pork chop in my oven with Apple glaze and seasoning, and it would have tasted the same). In addition, I like my pork/steak cooked over wood. Flemings broils or cooks over a gas grill.",

We specifically chose this place for the prime rib, unfortunately they did not have it despite offering this dish as their feature choice. We were offered an alternative for a significantly higher price. But it was not the price hike that we felt offended by, it was the condescending nature of the manager. We felt very uncomfortable and embarrassed that we even asked for a price match. This reason alone is why we thanked the server and left. I can handle bad food, but bad service is unacceptable.  We cane across the street to Fleming's and they did not have prime rib either, but they immediately offered an alternative with sides for the same price! We never asked, they offered it to us. They gave us the desert when we mentioned it was our anniversary and the server and the manager gave us a $50.00 gift card and a gift wrapped box full of chocolates!  Simply Amazing!",

So of course we had to go pay Fleming's a visit with some good friends.  We go to Fleming's for their steak because they know how to prepare it better than most!    For starters we were treated to a warm, rosemary loaf of bread.  The bread was already very good by itself, but the butters were even better.  I don't remember what each butter flavor was but I liked them both.  I preferred the orange (sun dried tomato maybe?) looking one.  The white one had a bit of a feta cheese taste to it.  We quickly polished off our whole loaf of bread.  Shortly after that, our soups and salads arrived, nothing special to write about here.  Next came our steak and lobster.  The server waited while we cut into our steaks to make sure that it was cooked to the precise way we had requested.  My lovely bride's steak was so small it looked as though it was meant to be on a tasting spoon and not part of a surf & turf. The server apologized and was embarrassed he had not noticed it prior to bringing it to our table and quickly sent for another one.  My steak was perfectly cooked, mid-rare but I could have used a bit more seasoning.  The lobster tail was the highlight for my meal. The lobster came out served on top of its tail shell, but then it was removed by the waiter, (as if I could not handle it on my own :-) The lobster was not at all dry, which I worried about.  It was moist, tender, and was pure lobster deliciousness!  As we dug into our steaks, we were given sides of asparagus and Fleming's potatoes.  I found the asparagus to be seasoned and cooked very well but a bit overly oily.  The Fleming's potatoes were like layers of lasagna, covered in a creamy sauce.  I've never been a big fan of any creamy potato dish, but this was exceptionally good.    For the finale we had Chocolate Lava Cake ~ a rich chocolate cake with a hot molten chocolate center, served with vanilla ice cream and sweet crisp wafers. The warm hot molten center with a scoop of the cool vanilla ice cream was the perfect way to end this wonderful meal.  Fleming's is a fantastic place to dine for a couple, family or with good friends.  They are a chain, but they know how to cook steak very well and they are consistent. They have an exceptional wine list, which is what I recommend. Their well drinks are a too pricey (vodka & water X 2 = $24) so stick with wine.",

    "text": "In the words of Monty Python, \"Run away! Run away!\" We have had several lovely meals at the DC Ranch location, so we tried this newly renovated spot, which turned out to be a horrid mistake. By the end of the meal we were debating whether it was our worst expensive meal ever. Here's what you get for $200/couple: It started when we were seated 20 mins late for our reservation - the hostess sounded genuinely perplexed that 'people are taking  longer than I expected.' (Hint: it's not your guests, it's your abysmal service.) Then we waited 35 minutes for first course, the squash ravioli, which was just OK (we were sharing it, but got no plates -- several waitstaff watched as we leaned over the table trying not to drip sauce all over). Then it was another 15 min wait until our spinach salad came (which was good). By now my wine glass was empty, and it would remain that way for the rest of the night without any offer for another. We had another 30 minute wait for our main course to arrive, which would have been more at home in an Outback Steak House and not even remotely worth the $50 price of admission -- my steak was undercooked, my wife's was overcooked. They weren't very tender or flavorful (mostly just over-salted). We ordered two sauces, and they brought the only one we DIDN'T ask for. The Fleming's potatoes, which I always love at the DC Ranch location, were mediocre here. The asparagus was cooked well but incredibly salty.  We also were treated to a show at neighbor's table as they sent back their steaks, and then received a shower of lobster bits as their server cracked open the shell (like a crustaceous IED). They did not look like they were enjoying their splurge meal.  The horrendous service and mediocre food would be disappointing even for a $50 meal. For a $200 meal it is outrageous. Do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY!",

They were doing a Duckhorn tasting where we were able to taste 6 different wines for $28 with our dinner.  The wines were very good and it was fun to try some wines the rose and whites with the seafood tower and then reds with our steak and French Onion Soup.  The seafood tower was very good and poke had fantastic flavor.  I have Celiacs and they were able to make our whole dinner gluten-free (they even had a separate GF menu).  My wife got the French Onion Soup and enjoyed it although she said it wasn't quite as rich as other's she's had.    We shared their 3 course meal ($55 total) which brought out a nice salad, filet over pork belly and delicious dessert. The salad was a good size and had candied nuts and dried fruit which was delicious.  The steak's here are always fantastic. The filet was tender and cooked perfectly when we ordered medium. The pork belly was also had good flavor but wasn't overly fatty which was nice.    For dessert we got a chocolate pudding of sorts with gluten-free brownie bites on top and some light whipped cream. It was fantastic!  They're always running specials so would suggest signing up for their emails. We'll definitely be back!",

My wife and I both got the filet mignon. The food was okay. For being a steakhouse I would have expected greater quality cuts. What really upset us was the fact some manager or older gentleman dressed in a suit (we think his name is Chris) was walking around to all the guests asking them how everything was. He looked at my wife and I and skipped us and went to the next group. I don't know what his intentions were but If I had to take a guess it is because we were much younger then the rest of the people in the restaurant. I really could have cared less that this man needs to come over to us and greet us but the fact that he didn't is upsetting. What really made this worse and why I'm writing this review, is that he went to the same tables again and skipped us AGAIN! What a loser! I would advise everyone to take their business elsewhere. Ruth Chris' Steakhouse is 3 minutes away from this place and is much higher class.   A word to Chris at Fleming's, targeting a specific crowd based on age is going to get you nowhere in 10-20 years when you expect people like us to come back to your restaurant and dine. Good Luck..  6 months later and still no response from the restaurant. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place!!!",

My dining partner and I are always creatures of habit, ordering the same thing, this time around we opted for a couple different items. Of course you can't go wrong here with the traditional steakhouse Shrimp Cocktail. I wanted to try the Sweet Chili Calamari, a new choice for us. Entrees were the 16 oz. New York Strip, the Petite Filet and as a side the Signature Tower of Onion Rings, another new choice for us. All the appetizers and side were delicious and the steaks were cooked to our request.

Tonight we came to the Scottsdale one and had a wonderful meal that was perfectly adequate.   Unfortunately I didn't feel the steak was cooked as well as it usually is and so did the 2 other guests with me. Don't get me wrong the food was delicious but for a $300 meal I usually expect the steak to be cooked better. It was medium rare as ordered but the sear was too thick and hard which made the steak chewy instead of being like butter which is usually what I have experienced at Fleming's....also the Rib eye is good!   Reviews of \"NON-STEAK\" things we ordered  APPS  Calamari: def worth an order it was good and sweet and spicy with sliced peppers.   Ahi Poke: wasn't good at all and wouldn't order it again.   SIDES  Mushrooms: DEF a must order as I love mushrooms and they do a good job cooking them.   Creamed Spinach: good for a veggie but other sides are better  Mash: it's not usually my go to potatoes there but def food!   Fleming's potatoes: the best potato side to order, it's like a very yummy scalloped potato!   DESSERT  Lava cake: A MUST ORDER in my book if you are going to Fleming's and never disappoints. You cut into that cake and get the oooey goooey filling falling out, just perfection!! Served with ice cream, raspberries and fresh cream.   Creme Brulee: DEF a must order but if you are choosing between the lava cake and any other ORDER THE LAVA CAKE",

We were there for my boyfriend's parents birthday celebration and the wait staff kept forgetting who ordered what drink and main dish. It was quite frustrating.  The steak my boyfriend got was super rare which was not what he ordered. I had the scallops which wasn't bad but the puree underneath was extra bland, it might as well not have been there. A good lemon garlic sauce would have been better.  We ordered a lemon drop type of martini, sorry I forgot the name and it was way too sweet. Not at all like what I expect from a martini also they said it would be sour.  Our bill was about $750 between 5 people. The food was not worth it. If you want good steak, this isn't the place to go to. Sorry",

Drinks- my husband had the blueberry drop, and it was perfectly sweet and lightly lemon-y. It came in a martini glass so there wasn't much drink for $15. I had a glass of the Ruffino moscato wine which was exactly what I expected- sweet, light, and perfect! App- my husband chose the pri fixe offering which came with an amuse Bouche which was caviar and sour cream on a savory pancake- it was fine, seemed like it was more for show than taste. The app was a mushroom bisque that was very good! It was earthy and seasoned very nicely. My husband doesn't even like mushrooms but he liked this bisque. Mains- my husband has the petite filet and colossal shrimp- the steak was cooked perfectly with a flavorful Demi glaze, and he loved it. There were 2 shrimp on the plate in a creamy garlic sauce and that was amazing! The best thing of the night. I had the classic filet and it was also cooked the way I ordered and was very flavorful. We also got the Fleming's potatoes to share which were awesome! dessert- White chocolate bread pudding. I didn't get the white chocolate, but the dessert was great! A little stiffer than a traditional bread pudding, but the couli and dark chocolate sauce served with it offered a lot of moisture.  All in all, this was a great dinner. The only reason I left off a star is that I felt the food just wasn't worth the price- $53 for an 11 oz filet a la carte is fine if it's the best steak you've ever had, and this was good, but not the best.   Our server Chad was amazing and deserves a huge shoutout! Also, Patrick never let our water glasses go below an inch from the top and the staff was very attentive.",

Not sure if we are just having bad luck but the last two times we went to DC Ranch we had a problems and now the last two times we went to this location we've had problems. We both got the filet mignon and lobster. The 8oz Prime filet came out perfectly cooked which I would expect. The lobster came out hard overcooked dry and actually had a tough crust on the top of it, not what you want with a lobster tail. Basically it was sitting out for a while or the chef just totally over cooked both of them. As well as my Caesar salad came out and they forgot the dressing?? It took them 10 minutes to bring out the dressing. Then for dessert we wanted the carrot cake but they were out of carrot cake which is one of their Signature Desserts so we ended up with a creme brulee which was good and a chocolate lava cake which took 20 minutes finally made it to the table and there was no lava inside just a dry sponge cake with ice cream. Very disappointing. Especially when you're paying $140 for the meal and half of it comes out incorrectly. Not sure if there is New Management or maybe they are not training their people as well as they used to. The chefs or Sous chefs seem to be lazy towards the end of the night and do not care what they put out. The last time here I had the entire mini bowl of hot butter spilled all over me. They need to step up their game because there are many many other great steakhouses right in the area that do a much better job at the same cost or lower. I would definitely go to Dominick's, Capital Grille, Ruth Chris or Mastro's over Fleming's.",

Food was not. Ordered a filet medium rare. It came just a tad less than well done. These things happen. Talked to the staff. They were on top of it. Second steak was less than rare. The middle was still ice cold from the refrigerator.  At that point I asked for the check and made a reservation at another restaurant. I may not be able to eat steak again for s long time after this.",

There were about 20 of us in the two hour class.  Very reasonably priced at $35.   We ate a ton of masterly cooked steaks and a lot of wine.  A lot of wine.  Did I mention a lot of wine???  Chef Jeff covered marbling, grading, cooking temperatures, buying steaks.  You might be surprised who he thinks sells the best meat in the Valley.  It was interesting to learn the differences between table salt and Kosher salt.  Sweet Jesus, I always thought Kosher salt was blessed by a Rabbi ......take the class and you may never use table salt again.  It was a fun, fun \"couples\" date.  Highly recommend.  Did I mention the wine?   Oh, and he will show you his Wagyu.  Pretty impressive.  It seemed like we drank a lot of wine.  Thanks Chef Jeff.   Put us down for the next class",

The dining room is dimly lit and has more of a romantic atmosphere to it.  The table had a white table cloth and I was glad to be wearing a collar!    The food was good.  I went for the prime rib and my wife had a fillet minion.  The side of brussel sprouts was really good.  It had a spice and kick that I've never tasted and I would easily order it again.  We wanted to try the shrimp cocktail appetizer, but our meal would have easily hit $150 had we gone for any appetizers.  The one thing to be aware of is that things add up quickly here.    The desserts were good.  I went for the lava cake and my wife had the creme brulee.  These were definitely the highlights of the meal.    This place is perfect for celebrating a special occasion as it will be memorable, but I do not think we could afford to come here every week.",

    "text": "This restaurant is receiving two stars for several reasons. First, they were seating reservations 45-55 minutes late. Why bother accepting reservations if you don't actually hold tables for them? When people have reservations, they want to be seated promptly. If a restaurant is unable to accommodate fast seating, then they are better off not accepting reservations at all.  At least people would know to expect a wait.  One hostess was personable and calming.  The other, with glasses, was terrible. She was patronizing to customers and quite rude in general.  The waiter we had was decent, nothing special and not personal. The gentleman filling water was very good - fast and attentive.  The food was nothing to write home about, albeit, we are vegetarian. Typically, steakhouses will offer vegetarian options that aren't on the menu. Fleming's did as well, but it was a compilation of their side dishes and appetizers.   One star for the berries and cream for dessert.   We only visited Fleming's because we had an AMEX promotion for $40 off, we won't be returning.",

The worst part is that my girlfriend went to the restroom and there is no toilet paper and the paper towel is really low too.  When I went to the men's restroom the paper towel was almost out and the Kleenex  box was completely out as we'll.   you would think someone should check the restroom periodically at a nice restaurant  .

When I made the reservation, I told them it was Jeff's birthday. Upon arrival, they wished him a happy birthday and escorted us from the [handsome but very noisy] main dining room into what looks like a converted private space. No ambiance, no windows but quieter.   And although we appreciate a reprieve from the noise, there was piped in [bad] music. Ugh. So I'm sitting in the back forty, eating a $9 salad that is mostly chopped iceburg lettuce, some cherry tomato and a few candied walnuts, drinking a Smirnoff Cosmo [my fault for not specifying the vodka] that had almost half a lime in it.   Dinner was the lovely's 6 oz filet, baked potato and asparagus, and my Lobster tempura. He was happy, I was not. To their credit, lobster was perfectly cooked and but the tempura coating was so greasy - greasy as in they didn't drain it properly. The soy ginger sauce had so much salt I couldn't enjoy it and the accompanying jicama salad was overdressed.   The chocolate lava cake was yummy, coffee was meh.   Before dessert, manager Tracy brought a gift card and wished Jeff a happy birthday - a nice touch but we wont got back. For almost $200 we can have a stellar meal, more food, and a lovely experience at Capital Grille.",

This is easily one of the best happy hours we've been to in the Scottsdale area.  I've been there twice and both times there has been a wait.  I wish you could make reservations for the bar area for Happy Hour, but unfortunately that isn't possible.  Here's why the Happy Hour is so busy: The service is outstanding, as are the deals. The burger is incredible ... for $7 I don't think you can do better.  Just don't get the onion rings ... it literally only came with 2 of them.  The drinks were strong and delicious.  $3 for a beer and $6 for specialty cocktails.  The Baked Brie and the Pork Belly appetizers were amazing.  As for dinner, everything was pretty delicious.  Both steaks were very good, but mine had far too much seasoning.    We didn't like our server because she seemed to be pretty pushy in terms of upselling, but she could have been having a bad day.  We also thought it was odd how often we saw the hostesses walking around checking on table progress.  Usually at such a nice restaurant, they're not as concerned with table turnover.  it was pretty darn expensive overall, but that's to be expected with a steakhouse.   Overall, I would recommend Fleming's more for Happy Hour than dinner, but both are great.  Enjoy!",

We just can't get enough of the exceptional service and quality food. Every server we've had has been great and you can tell management knows how to run a successful business. I have never been less than extremely satisfied. My fiance has a weak stomach and he says the steak here has always been delicious and never has bothered his stomach. I've had everything from salmon to steak and it's all so good!!  ANOTHER GREAT THING about this establishment that I must stress- they always make you feel welcome and a valued customer, always. We are in our mid to late twenties and have been to Mastro's City Hall and Ocean club and every time have been sat in the back corner because they think we look young and will not \"spend enough money.\" We always do and tip accordingly, of course, but that's not the experience I want to have when we're dropping a couple hundred dollars for dinner. At Fleming's we either get one of the big booths in the middle or a table right in the middle. It may sound like something ridiculous to say, but it really does make all the difference for your experience. Fleming's will always have a place in our heart. Thanks for the great memories and even greater food!",

Rich and Richie took exceptional care of us.  They were attentive and fun to talk to... too.  I had the Prime Rib and it was huge and perfectly prepared. I ended up taking the rest home and having it for lunch the next day and it was just as good the following day.  :)  The Bread to start came with 2 different flavored butters.  You could easily fill up on bread before dinner.... so go easy on this as they will keep bringing out refills if you let them.  The Dessert.... we got the Chocolate Lava Cake... and the cake part was good... but the sides that came with the cake... they were Amazing.  The Chantilly Cream they serve on the side of the cake is freshly made and it's a Little Pillow of Heaven.  Rich brought us more when we ate all the cream and still had cake left.  And then they have a little homemade pistachio cookie with vanilla ice cream on the side too... these were great too... So, net, net... I wouldn't order the Chocolate Lava Cake for the cake part.... I'd order it for the things that come WITH the cake.  :)  Good for special occassions and if you are looking to have a lovely evening out.",

We have been to locations in Tyson's Corner, Naples, Orlando and Tampa. We love this brand, the food is good and the service excellent.   Not this Scottsdale location. We arrived on time for our reservation. First, they took the wrong name. After my wife spelled it out. So there wasn't a reservation according to the greeter. We had to convince her to look again. Thankfully my wife's unique first name allowed them to find it. Then we sat for 25 min as walk ins and a group of six, whose reservation was also lost were sat.   Finally we were sat and waited for about 10 minutes before our waiter came. He took our Order but by drink glass was frequently empty throughout the night. My wife ordered her usual small plates filet, substituting the mushroom risotto. And was told they cannot do that. She normally does this but ok.   Good was on par after we got it. But we will not go here again. I hope the north scottsdale location is better.",

Best steak that I have ever had at any place! I also got the Fleming's potatoes, which had a perfect jalapeno flavor! The chocolate lava cake did take awhile to be made, which was told to us by our waitress, but regardless worth the wait! Food was superb! The reason that I'm rating a 4/5 is the service. To start, the waitress reached across me without asking to grab wine glasses after we said that we were not going to have wine and didn't say excuse me. The person who brought out our appetizer grabbed our bread and dip(when we hadn't finished it) and didn't ask us if we were done. The first waitress that I spoke of before also came by and asked us if we would like desert as the chocolate lava cake would take 20 minutes and we said we will look at the menu. She responded by saying that she would come back. We finished our food after 5 minutes and then she never came back for 5-10 minutes after we finished, which in turn made our wait for dessert 30-35 minutes. The food was the best, but the service shows need for some improvement and attention to detail.",

Lots of dark wood paneling, exposed stainless kitchen, linen tablecloths, attentive staff and a little pricey.  Similar to Capitol Grill or Ruth Chris.  I think it's the same group that owns P.F. Changs.  I took some friends there last night and everybody had good food and good service.  Noise can be a factor here as an adjacent large table, filled with large people with large voices were something of an irritation.  Sound seems to ricochet off of all restaurant surfaces.  Flemings is really proud of their wine list with prices to match.  Wine and several side dishes will add another $ to the price range.  You can easily have a five star night and probably wont be disappointed.",

The service was simply outstanding we were treated like royalty and when one of the steaks delivered to the table we just a little overcooked they brought out the chef and insisted we allow them to make another.  Best part is they let us keep the mistake - thats nice when your talking a $50.00 piece of prime beef.  The ribeyes are amazing - ask for the ribeye that they bring to the table and cut off the bone for you WOW.  The wine selection was among the best in Scottsdale and the cocktails a perfect blend.

Oh and then get the Fleming's Potatoes.  Like a combo of scalloped potatoes and enough cheese to choke a donkey, truly delicious.  I know the wine list is killer, but I can't stop myself from downing one (or four) of their amazing martini's.  There is a huge list of them that I have such a great time touring.    Finally, desserts!  I cannot come here without a group because after eating my steak, potatoes, (oh and great apps too, try the seafood tower, it is really tall), and drinks I don't have enough room to eat a whole dessert, let alone two because that is what I am going to order.  Yes I cannot make up my mind between Chocolate Lava Cake and Creme Brulee so I do what I do best and get both (to share of course).  They are so good and together they compliment each other perfectly.  The Lava Cake is so chocolaty that I could go into a coma and the top of the Creme Brulee cracks perfectly under my spoon.  I think I am diabetic now.  In all, this place is amazing, pricey but well worth it.  True you can come not dressed up but I like to make an occasion out of it.  You can find me in a cocktail dress with the chipmunk cheeks stuffed with food.  PS do yourself a favor and think about making a reservation, comes in handy.",

    "text": "I have a long history with Flemings...We go way back. Seattle, Washington, high school Senior Prom dinner. Yeah...That far back. That location is now closed, but I digress. When I moved to Scottsdale, I was excited immediately because there were multiple Flemings locations. It quickly became my go to special occasion dinner option, as my wife loves it as well.   In short, the food is phenomenal. I've had multiple cuts of steak there and different preparations and they're all amazing. Last time I had a 6oz Filet that was stuffed with jumbo lump crab...Just let that sink in for a minute. Their sides and salads are also really nicely done, and their wine list and bar is one of the best out there. They also have a very good happy hour which is a pretty well kept secret. It's 5 items for $6 until 7pm Monday through Friday, and they also have $6 glasses of wine and cocktails as well.   Obviously the food should be great, but the thing that sets Flemings apart for me is the service and commitment to quality. A brief story, if I may...  In July of 2011 I made reservations for my wedding anniversary. We got to the restaurant and were seated, everything started out fine. It took longer than usual to get the bread course and to get our order taken, and since it was a Wednesday night it was a little surprising. Everything was taking forever, but the biggest disappointment was the food. I ordered a New York peppercorn steak medium rare. When it came, it was well done. Brown inside and tough...I sent it back and they were apologetic for the mistake. It took nearly 20 minutes for me to get my second steak (my wife was done eating hers by this time), and while it was still overcooked for my liking, it was edible. The rest of the service continued to take way longer than necessary, the waitress wasn't attentive, and at the end of the meal, there was an issue with the bill that took another 15 minutes to resolve. It took nearly 3 hours (and not in a good way) from start to finish, and was not a good dining experience in the least.  I ended up writing Flemings the next day to express my disappointment, because it was a special occasion, and I'd never before been unhappy with the food or service I received. Within 24 hours, I had an email from the President of the company saying that he was very sorry and he'd have the GM of the restaurant reach out to me to amend any issues. The next day I got a call from the GM Mike Head and we chatted for a few minutes about our experience. He too apologized and asked me for my address so he could send something to make it right. Two days later I had a letter with a business card and a note saying \"please call me personally to arrange your next reservation\", along with $150 in gift certificates. I was floored.  We've since returned a few times, and the food and service was back to it's absolute best. You will rarely, if ever, see business done like this, and it's the reason I'm happy to keep Flemings as my special occasion go to.",

I like to grill, and like my own preparation is better, and it's really not that hard.  I usually can't see spending a lot of cash on something I like better cooking myself.  Flemings is very good.  The filet mignon was perfectly seasoned and done medium rare.  Many steak places I have tried usually under season their meats, which leaves them bland.   They also try to cook them too quickly.   The reasons for this are really customer service; don't shock the customer, and get them their dinner quickly.    Beef should have a fair amount of time on salt to bring out flavor, and slower cooking to keep the meat tender, juicy and flavorful.  The appsy were great.  Salad, Onion soup, and mashed potatoes.    They have some great wine, although I felt they were trying to be a bit manipulative.   The wine list was ranked  gold, silver, bronze, but it was purely on price, not relative to how good they really were.   I had a better cheaper wine, than more expensive.  This is a place where I would bring my own wine, and pay corkage.",

He was very professional, attentive without being overbearing, knowledgeable, friendly but not too \"chummy\". He offered birthday and anniversary wishes as well.   Husband and I both ordered the Lobster Tails. They were perfectly cooked. I ordered the Fleming's Potatoes which were delicious..a sort of scalloped potato with cream, cheese and jalapenos. Husband ordered Sauteed Mushrooms which were also very tasty. For dessert we ordered the Creme Brulee. We ordered one but Nate came out with two desserts, each with a lit candle. The Chantilly Cream they served with the Brulee's was out of this world, crazy good! Don't miss that. After all this we were sent home with a large piece of chocolate cake to continue our celebration.  The entire experience was wonderful! Fantastic service and great food.

Tip for those not familiar with Scottsdale - this Flemings is located in the Hilton hotel on Scottsdale Ave.  The address isn't really on the building, so it may not be super easy to find if you're just looking for the address.  I had the boneless rib eye.   I ordered it medium rare, but it was probably closer to medium, but still very flavorful, tender, and juicy.  They season only with salt and pepper to really let the True beef flavor come through.  This reminded me of the rib eye at Delmonico's (Emeril Lagasse's restaurant) inside Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, which is also an excellent steak house.  My girlfriend got the fillet mignon (medium plus) with stuffed flounder.  Maybe because the fillet was medium plus, I really couldn't appreciate it as much.  The flounder was excellent.  Everything is a la carte, so it can get kind of pricey.  We got the lobster chowder (one of the best I've had), creamed corn (very good), sauteed spinach (excellent alternative to creamed spinach, surprisingly very good), and chocolate lava souffle for dessert (which is a must).  The bread is also really good.  I know you don't go to a steakhouse for the bread, but I can appreciate good, fresh bread with good butter.  For the 2 of us, it was $160 including the tip (and no alcohol).  Overall, a great dining experience with excellent steaks.",

For dessert, I ordered the lava cake with vanilla ice cream.  This is the True test. Is the cake center gooey and warm so that the fudge runs out to be met by the vanilla ice cream?  YES! Perfect! Love this place!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I absolutely hate to review any business less than 5 stars. But it is extremely necessary in this circumstance.   My fiance and I had a reservation on New Years Eve. We expected the place to be packed which it was. We didn't expect to be seated right away I understand that people linger on holidays. What I didn't expect was that they were an hour and a half behind on reservations. I really wasn't even mad about that. We had several interesting conversations with other couples that were waiting so the time passed by pretty quickly.   What was really frustrating is we were sitting there for a long time. So I watched every person check in. We were also chit chatting with everyone so I knew what time each persons reservation was supposed to be at.   Two tables were open in the bar (with the white table cloth is how they described it) for a very long time these tables sat empty. Fast forward 45 minutes and the hostess asked a gentleman sitting next to me if he would like to take the table in the bar. He declined and waited for a dining room table. He was there with his girlfriend...so a table for 2 just like us. But his reservation was 30 minutes after us and he checked in way after us. The difference is he complained about the wait time. So they were trying to seat him before us. 15 minutes later the hostess offered my fiance and I that table. We took it.   No apologies for the wait.   Our server came over to greet us and said \"I've been telling them to seat people in here all night\"  Everyone waited a long time New Year's Eve so obviously there is mismanagement on reservations. But I watched them seat people in a very confusing order. And I was extremely mad they were going to seat a reservation 30 minutes after us. We should have been offered that option first.   To make matters worse I watched a manager yelling at a server right next to our table. Then to make it extremely worse the couple that complained about the wait got part of their meal comp'd.   Our reservation was at 915 we were seated at 1030. No apologies nothing at all.   Food was great. Amazing even. Our server was fabulous. But I will never go back. I've never seen such disorganization.",

We enjoy the Wines of course and some of the appetizers we get are the Roasted Pork Belly, Carpaccio, and Mushroom Ravioli.  Our fav entree is the Prime Burger w/Cheese & Bacon...it's a huge Burger for only $6.  This is a great spot for dinner or happy hour, check it out if you can.

Wasn't excited about being seated in a small back room but probably would have been reseated if I'd asked. I started out with a Macallan 12.  Don't think I've ever been charged over $20 for one but it was a reasonable pour. Calamari for an appetizer.  Cooked perfectly and could have easily been shared. The wedge salad had plenty of good blue cheese.  I don't think it mentioned the type of lettuce but it wasn't a crispy iceberg like most. My strip steak was closer to medium than the medium-rare I asked for but it was a delicious piece of meat.  Very flavorful and more tender than a strip usually is. Loaded baked potato was done just right.  It too would have been plenty to share. The table assistants were really in the ball.  My server, not quite as attentive as I'd expect at a restaurant in this price range ($120.00). Overall I'd give tonight's dinner a 9 on food and an 8 on service.  Huge improvement over my last visit.",

When you go to Fleming's it's all about the steak. I usually stick with the fillet mignon cooked medium but decided to try the Wagyu New York strip. I learned that Wagyu is the American way of Kobe beef, so I had to try it! I was very impressed, the steak was tender and very flavorful. It's a more deeper flavor than the fillet. I think I would actually order it medium rare next time though as the closer to the center of the strip the more flavorful it became. Overall a great piece of meat.  My wife ordered the Sunday prime rib special. Talk about a deal...she got a wedge salad, thick cut of prime rib, mash potatoes to share, and a dessert! All for $40..really for the amount of food and quality you can't beat that. We ended up sharing the lava cake which was amazing...even was served with ice cream.   We also shared the chipotle Mac n cheese, so good I was in heaven!   Service was great usual and ambiance was very nice.",

I will say this: Fleming's Prime Steakhouse-Scottsdale is slightly behind Donovan's Steak & Chop House - Phoenix, but it is WAYYYYYY better than Mastro's Restaurants - City Hall. However, all the steakhouses in Arizona pale in comparison to Bern's Steak House in Tampa, FL (the best tasting steak and the best bang for your buck out of all the restaurants we have visited).  My wife ordered the taste of the seasons: Filet Mignon and scallops Salad Puff pastries (like beignets) with in-house whipped cream  My order: Main Filet Mignon (Oscar style with shrimp as well) Asparagus Molten Lava Cake  Overall, we enjoyed it.  My wife really loved the pistachio cookies that accompany the cake & vanilla ice cream.  I would come back to let my daughter experience it, and also they have a Prime Rib deal every Sunday (which comes with a salad, your choice of side, and your choice of dessert) for $35.",

    "text": "We celebrated our 33rd wedding anniversary one evening and the experience was unforgettable.  My wife enjoys a good steak and so, I thought of Fleming s. I've been to Ruth Chris', but heard so much about Fleming s that I decided to give them a try.  From the moment we walked in, we were treated like regulars. We sat at a booth which was nice and comfy. Our server was Nick who was very friendly, pleasant and  was very knowledgeable, but he cleared more utensils that he needed to and forgot to bring the two knives that were removed.  We weren't rushed and had enough time to decide on our meal. My wife started with a glass of Pinot Noir and since I'm allergic to alcohol, I had water.  The appetizer, Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes was not jumbo, but the crab and sauce flavors were. The salad, Lettuce Wedge, you were given a slice of bacon and blue cheese which you had to crumble yourself and my wife's Modern Caesar Salad was excellent. Main course, Newport Filet and Main Filet with a side of sauteed mushrooms were cooked to perfection and the button mushrooms are the ones I like instead of the sliced ones.  We followed the evening meal with the Turtle Pie and coffee which capped off a wonderful anniversary dinner. By the time we finished our first cup, Nick was right there filling our coffee cups again.  The manager came to our table several times to check on us, was friendly and gave us an incentive to come back which we will definitely use. We only saw our server once during our meal. The bus boy was terrific, he brought our missing pair of knives and kept our water glasses filled and cleared our table for us. Everyone there was so friendly and was not your typical stuffy high-end restaurant atmosphere.",

The meal was perfect.  started with the seafood tower, Came with Lobster Tail and Crab Legs, Yum i had to order a second tower as well cause it was to die for.  for my meal i went with the Lamb Chops. The bite as perfect and juicy. Ordered it medium rare. i didn't even have to use any sauce with it as well. it was perfectly cooked as it.   I over stuffed myself with food because of the taste and how fresh the meat was, Tender just the way i liked it. the chew was soft and went down easily.  There service is on point and some of the best service that i have seen yet, this place deserves a 5 star rating.  If your in the area and looking to be wined and dined, then this is your spot, its nice and quiet here so you don't have to speak up or listen in to hear the other person.",

Super piece of Chilean Sea Bass and Waygu Strip Steak both cooked superbly after two interesting salads.  We split an order of Fleming's potatoes, which was smart, otherwise we would not have had room for the Belgian chocolate lava cake. Throw in a fine glass of Pinot Noir and a white blend from France called The Whip and we could hardly walk to our car. Overall, it really was a great dinner. One important component to tonight's dinner was the great service we received from Sara Flanigan our server. Thanks to her for the friendly and efficient service.   Finally Thanks to Darrin Visser and his colleagues for stepping up and taking good care of us, this is what we have come to expect from Fleming's.   Five stars tonight gang!",

Our visit to Fleming's was far below my expectations.   I had heard wonderful things about Fleming's for their happy hour, and, indeed, the happy hour has some great options. I'll return for that. Service was decent; we remained at the bar. And there was a fantastic wine selection with reasonable prices.   However, when it comes to steak: mine was overcooked (I ordered it medium) and not sufficiently trimmed (I got a filet). Sides were unmemorable.",

The one unhappy exception is Flemings by the Hilton on Scottsdale road.  But hey it's a steak house with a decent reputation , why not try it.  And we did.  And we were very disappointed.  Our waitress told us Absolute vodka was the happy hour vodka.  So given that we ordered a round....on the rocks and with soda. We had friends with us so when I saw $10 for each vodka while paying the bill I  was a bit peeved.  So I get home and call Flemings and speak to the bartender and he says \"No sir, what you ordered are not happy hour items\". What???    Bottom line nobody knows what they are doing.  Will never go back even with their good onion rings but very small happy hour burger.  They better educate staff when asked a direct question about the menu.  Sure not the worst thing that can happen in life but it's irritating.",

The huge patty is served on a roll, with lettuce, tomato and your choice of cheese. Pickles are only by request, why??  Happy Hour beers on tap are a great way to round out a cheap and fantastic meal at Fleming's during happy hour!  If you can find a seat on the patio, you can sit near their open fireplace.

They are usually at full capacity, and you may wait for your food, but the servers are excellent, and it's a place to enjoy the ambiance and wine. The extensive wine list is on an interactive iPad that includes the wine ratings and pairing suggestions. Although, I usually prefer the filet mignon, the seafood is exceptional, and the apple-mustard pork chop is delicious, however I have found the chicken disappointing. The best sides to share are the Fleming's cheesy potatoes with jalapenos, Chipotle mac & cheese, creamed spinach, and grilled asparagus. It is also a nice place take someone for their birthday as Fleming's will present them with a small signature box of chocolates and gift card for return visit. One interesting note is that the well drinks have a large round ice cube, which although very trendy, it does fill the whole glass leaving very little of the pricy drinks. Steaks range from $40. to $60. and sides (for two) are $11.",

Not two minutes later she came and took a different party of two to their seats. We finally got seated and we're lead into a mostly empty room. Don't know why we have been waiting for so long. Small detail but we were hungry, the bread basket came out after our dinners were served. This was after we asked twice for the bread. Bread was brought out to another table but not us. I informed the manager of our experience and he apologized for it all. It's not what he wanted to hear but it was what it was and hopefully they get together to make sure nobody has an experience like this. It should be and probably is a better place than what we experienced. We just won't be back. There are other steak restaurants in the vicinity that we feel provides a better all around experience.",

The dishes are on the small side, but the quality is True to what you'd expect at Fleming's, so it was good bang for our buck.

    "text": "I draw two conclusions from reading the rest of the reviews: a) most people wouldn't know good ( no less great! ) food if they were ever to experience it; and, b) more people judge the quality of a restaurant by its happy hour than by its food.  Because I was a first-timer at this establishment, the manager came to my table, introduced himself, and inquired as to my satisfaction with my dining experience.  I politely sugarcoated it, later regretting that I did not tell him what I am about to share with you.  I did that because most people really do not want your honest opinion and will instinctively dig their heels in and defend themselves against every criticism you may voice regardless of how well intentioned you may be.  I wasn't looking for a debate and I didn't want to heap criticism upon him over something of which he presumably is proud.  The one star I gave this place was for the service - which was excellent.  From there we start deducting stars.  Flemings needs to hire an acoustical engineer to suggest ways of lower the deafening sound levels in the place (6:30 on a Sunday evening in July).  I couldn't hear half of what the servers said to me - I just nodded approval or agreement.  A small loaf of bread was provided - with two spreads: a garlic butter and another, orange in color. I sampled a bit of each on the end of a fork and found the primary ingredient of the orange substance was some sort of thick, heavy grease that coated one's tongue and the roof of one's mouth.  Terrible! I stuck with the garlic butter.  I chose a Caesar salad, and even though there was hardly any dressing on it, I ate every bit of it.  It was OK.  A appreciated touch here was the option of having anchovies on your salad.  When was the last time you had that choice?  The prime rib came with three dips: a mustardy concoction which I didn't care for (which doesn't mean it was not good), creamed horseradish (very good), and aj-jus. The latter had absolutely NO flavor, leaving me to wonder how something with so much color could possibly have no more flavor than tap water.  The beef was the size of my hand - a respectable portion - and light pink in color, just as I had specified.  It looked delicious.  However, it was dry and firm/tough/chewy.  I ate less than half and turned down the offer to package the rest for my trip home.  What could I do with it to salvage it at home?!?!  The single side dish I ordered was mushrooms.  The server did not say how they would be prepared: broiled, sauteed, etc.  And, while the cooking method was not apparent, they were rich dark brown  buttons, and a portion that was large to share with two others.  They had been prepared mixed with whole garlic cloves.  The problem: they were tasteless, despite the presence of the garlic and what I took for melted butter.  By then I was ready to leave and declined the included dessert.  My waitress, however, suggested I take with me a portion of the mixed berry option on the dessert list.  I did, and consumed the pleasant mix the following morning at breakfast.  But, I did not use the separately packaged \"whipped cream\" accompaniment, as it - like the orange colored prime rib dip - was made of fat/grease that tended to coat the tongue and mouth.  When I encounter something like that, I can't help but think how it coats one's arteries, too!   Sorry, Flemings.  I went with such high expectations and left throughly disappointed.",

    "text": "Now I know what everyone thinks, \"This is a chair restaurant, why are you bothering with a review?\"  Well, two reasons, one they have amazing service and two - I ate the MOST outstanding burger since I moved to AZ.  I arrived at 6:30 - waiting patiently for my 2 friends who were leaving the country for good, a little goodbye party.   My waitress was the sweetest person I had met and she really cared about her job and the tables she was dealing with.  I couldn't help but love her.  I ordered food and drink off the Happy Hour Menu - and let me stop here to explain this amazing situation: $5 food, martinis and wine - ARE YOU SERIOUS?  (as a heart attack) Anyway I was still waiting on my very late friends and wanted to stick in their 2 drinks before happy hour ended - and the lovely waitress ordered them, but waited to bring them, because she doesn't want them to have warm drinks - Can you believe this amazing service?  Lets move into the Burger, with peppered bacon and cheddar cheese.  Huge onion ring, and a little wedge for my burger.  I have no clue what sauce was served, but it was outstanding too.  I scarfed half the burger and could barely save the second half for my BFF (who still wasn't there).  The BBQ Shrimp, Calamari and Ahi Tuna all were amazing and I cannot rave enough.   I really appreciate staff and the restaurants they work at that go that extra mile.  They easily could have made me pay full price for the additional 2 beverages, but they didn't and its those little gifts that earn a review like this and a pat on the back!!",

    "text": "Okay so normally I don't leave many reviews unless I want to warn people not to go somewhere but I was just reading through these reviews and was surprised to see 1 star reviews due to customer service and being judged because of the way a person looks or dress. Now I've been to this location numerous times but granted I did dress in a long sleeve express shirt, jeans and a pair of buckle dress shoes. Not the nicest outfit compare to what people said that if you didn't have a suit on then you didn't get service but I decided to put it to the ultimate test and by the way every man should own 1 nice outfit at least but that is besides the point so here is what I did.   I decided to go as casual as I could. I literally wore a pair of dark grey slack shorts, with a Hurley shirt and pair of old school D.C. Shoes. Now take into consideration I\"m covered in tattoos as well. I had nothing nice on and even wore my ever day citizen watch which I bought at Costco for 250 bucks along with my hundred dollar gift card for 80 bucks which is always a must if you going to Fleming's. Now we went on Sunday for the Prime Rib special and only drank WATER besides a Heineken I ordered after already sitting the second time my waitress came by. Now I keep track of how many times our waitress and her helpers check on us and after 12 times I decided to stop counting. We never had an empty glass of WATER, we never didn't have service, food or anything else we needed. At one point my glass almost got half way empty before it was filled up. Our waitress was amazing and knew the menu back and forth and also was kind enough to suggest any specials they were offering. The manager on hand came by to make sure our meal was to our expectations and stayed to chat with us for a while.   When our meal was done our waitress had our extra food bagged and it was not because it was a slow nice. Every table in the main dining area was full and she had her hands full. The service and food was amazing and if you looking for a nice night out and an amazing steak with specials almost all the time and a casual atmosphere then Fleming's is a place for you. Out the door for 3 Prime Rib Specials that included a soup or salad, a side (which for an extra 8 dollars we upgraded to the lobster mash potatoes which were amazing and would recommend doing if they are serving it) a big Prime Rib and dessert for 39.99, plus coffee & beer we only paid $146.00 and of course left 190.00 for the superb service. If you going somewhere nice it's just part of eating. Tip your servers if they work their butts off. Was a great night out with my mom and girl and will be back again soon. Thanks Fleming's.",

This place is dimly lit, but not to the extreme where you cannot read the menu without your server pulling out a pen light. That's annoying so things were already off to a great start.   Everything was delicious. I loved the sun-dried tomato butter that came with the bread. We had very generous servings of the french onion soup. It's the best I've had. It was very flavorful. We ordered the lamb and the fillet Mignon. Both were pretty good. I'm not sure what to think of the mint sauce that came with the lamb. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. We ended off the night stuffing ourselves with a creme brulee and chocolate mousse. We find it hard to say no to dessert.   The service was great. Our glasses of water and wine were never empty and our courses were fairly well timed.   I hear they have a great happy hour and I liked the bar area so we will certainty be back for drinks.",

How does Fleming's fit in with the whole asian themed restaurant empire thingy that Peter Fleming put together?  I don't know...more importantly, I don't care...Fleming's Steakhouse is the best of the lot by my lights:)  Does Fleming's make the best steak in town?   Well no, the best steak in town comes off my grill, when I'm in the mood to grill:)  But I'm not always in the mood to grill my own steak and when I'm not, Flemings consistently puts a very solid medium rare Rib Eye ( with a little salad and a few string fries) right in front of me (along with a couple of well made Grey Goose marti's:)  They do it in a friendly style with  exemplary and easy going service in a warm and welcoming atmosphere...lighter decor than some of the very low lit/dark wood/red velvet steakhouses (BTW...not enough light to read the menu doesn't make the steak taste any better:)  Flemings has never done me wrong...  I have never felt \"optimized\" like I do at Ruth's Chris...I haven't felt that I overpaid for mediocre food like I do at Morton's or Mastro's...I never feel that I'm out of place when I show up wearing my shorts, sandals and golf shirt (exquisitely tailored, highly expensive shorts, sandals and golf shirt, but nevertheless:)  Flemings is a comfortable and pleasant place to grab a steak:)  The Beautiful Carin and I wandered over the other evening, intending to take advantage of the current Happy Hour specials (5 items for $6...5 wines, 5 cocktails and five small plates, each priced at $6...all of which are phenomenal, BTW:)  But after a couple of well crafted and astonishingly cold marti's, we decided we wanted dinner:)  I had the bone in Rib Eye and Carin had the New York Strip (my girl likes her steak:)  We split some shoestring potatoes and grilled asparagus:)  Everything was essentially perfect...a little too much food, but we took it home and DeeDee continues to believe that we are The Best People Ever:)  The next time you're in the mood for steak and you don't feel like heading out to your grill on a balmy 112 degree Scottsdale evening, put on your shorts and golf shirt, slide into your sandals, get comfy in a booth at Flemings and build yourself a $200 credit card bill.  Hey, I never said they were cheap...just good!",

Lucky me, my bf is in town for work so I can FINALLY take him to this place that I have been raving out (see Nashville review for more details on the menu).\r \r They give you two cheese dips here with sliced cracker/bread and celery sticks. One of them being a gorgonzola cranberry spread. DELICIOUS.\r \r We ordered:\r \r TENDERLOIN CARPACCIO - Although I remember it being tastier in the Nashville chain, this is still very good and better than any I have had in California thus far.\r \r SEARED AHI TUNA - love it! This restaurant (not Japanese sushi joints) is why I am so hooked on tuna. Ironic isn't it? My bf loves this too.\r \r BEEF FLEMINGTON filet wrapped in puff pastry with a mushroom duxelle, madeira sauce - This is by far my FAVORITE MEAT dish EVER! They cook it to perfection (remember I am a medium-rare girl), and it simply MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH. The combination of the tender filet and the buttery pastry is HEAVEN in your mouth. My bf LOVED this too and felt it was an exceptional dish. Ratings for this are up there with Nobu.\r  \r SEARED SCALLOPS lobster cream sauce with a puff pastry of sauted fresh vegetables - My bf thought this was very good but not as good as the Beef Flemington. We had the ultimate BEST SEARED SCALLOPS in Paris (at an average restaurant too), so it would be hard to have something that is up to par with that. Still a nice tasty dish. I love those puff pastries.\r \r CHOCOLATE LAVA CAKE - This is the second best lava cake next to the Culinary Institute of America in Napa. HEAVENLY, FRESH, RIGHT OUT OF THE OVEN. Delicious! And they don't cheat at this one. No hole on the bottom of the cake to put the filling in! I love bittersweet chocolate. Ummmm.\r \r The wine selection is great. They recommended a smooth Italian red wine for us (I think it was a sirah). The service is great. Despite how large the restaurant is, the high quality of their dishes remain the same. After eating here, then eating at Alexander's (Cupertino, CA -- see my review =D) back home makes any other steakhouse taste mediocre.",

(Let me tell you something I love about Arizona: in Chicago, you could never get away with wearing a t-shirt, shorts, sandals and a straw fedora to a steakhouse. But, luckily for me, things seem to be more lax in AZ. Also, lucky for me because my bags were on my original flight back to Chicago and I, clearly, was not.)  Anyway, my buddy and I sat in the bar section, where it was a little more lively, so we could catch some highlights and relax. Everything I ordered was superb. Started off with a perfectly made No. 10 martini (kudos) and then went with the Wedge. The blue cheese dressing was excellent. Then I, of course, went right for the Bone-In Ribeye (med. rare). When it came out, it was as if God, himself, was speaking directly to me. Perfectly cooked, pefectly marbled, great cut of beef. I don't even remember what sides we ordered, it didn't matter. Either way, Flemings: they know how to make a drink, they know how to cook a steak, and they're pretty cool about the whole thing. Go there.",

It was correctly cooked and tasted very good. Just like I make at home when I buy steaks from AJ's. The reason I was not very happy was that my bill was around $80 for a small filet, a couple glasses of wine and a couple shared mediocre appetizers with two other people. No sides come with the meat at all. My steak was close to $30 alone. For a place that bills itself as a wine bar, I was disappointed with the by-the-glass choices. I guess if you are only searching for a good-tasting steak and you don't know how to cook, Fleming's is the place to go.    Guess that's what you get with the \"lowest common denominator\" style big national chains. I would not steer most people away from here, as I think this is what most people want: predictable and decent. I just figure I don't want to spend my money or calories on boring food when there are so many awesome local restaurants in this city!",

We have been to many various Fleming's locations and service/food never disappointed. I made reservations, we arrived on time greeted by a not so friendly hostess. She informed me that she couldn't locate our reservation and suggested we were at a wrong location. I had to pull out my phone to verify their number and showed her that I'd called the day before. She somehow found the reservation after all. We waited another 25 minutes while people were walking in with reservation, being seated. I inquired and was told they had \"reserved seating\". Apparently a reservation here does NOT reserve you a seat, so don't bother! A party of 6 walks in, their reservation is also not located however they're immediately seated - a PARTY OF 6! Once seated, service continued to be slow. 20 mins after being at the table, I finally was able to order a glass of wine. Will not be returning to this location as we were both disappointed.",

    "text": "It took a little convincing, but Hottie and I decided to give Flemings a second shot.  Let me just say, it was like we dined at a totally difference restaurant!  We were pleasantly greeted by the hostess, who offered us our choice of table (despite the fact that the place was just about at capacity).   To start us off, our server recommended a new specialty cocktail with vodka, fruit juice and Prosseco which was less than 99 calories.   It was delicious! She also recommended a couple Pino Noir options for Hottie, who was very pleased.  I started off with the Flemings salad.  Really nothing special, actually the dressing was rather bland and it was served over romaine.  It really should have been served over spring mix or arugula... and adding a little cheese never hurts!  Regardless, I was perfectly happy with the complimentary warm bread and infused butter spreads to start me off.  For dinner the server recommended a \"super secret\" menu item for vegetarians.    I'm not sure what it was called, but it had layers of spinach, portabella, asparagus and roasted red pepper served over a very tasty red cream sauce .  On the side, I ordered the chipotle mac-n-cheese, YUM!  I don't even want to imagine the number of calories that were stuffed into that plate of cheesy goodness!  My Hottie ordered their special, a filet bone-in cooked medium rare with Flemings potatoes on the side.  This time his steak came out cooked perfectly, in fact by the end he was eating it off the bone... gross! For desert we had the chocolate lava cake.  I was a little leery, because typically these are served very small and obviously just reheated in the microwave for about 30 seconds. Not the case here.   It was the size of a softball, and just heavenly... warm chocolate oozing out of center, topped with ice cream and some kind of pistachio cookie... mmmm, still licking my lips! Okay, Flemings... Now I'm a FAN!",

    "text": "The atmosphere is great, although it was an upscale restaurant it felt very relaxed and friendly. The most recent time I was there was for their happy hour in the bar and it was delicious. During happy hour they have several appetizers for $6 (very friendly on the wallet) The baked Brie served with apple slices was cooked perfectly along with the Wicked Cajun Shrimp. They also have a Fleming's prime burger with cheese and bacon for $6 which was grilled to the perfect medium as we had asked served with these colossal onion rings. We topped our meal off with the Chocolate lava cake (let your server know ahead of time if you want to order this as it does take a while) and the Creme Brulee both of which were delicious. Overall I can't wait to go back and if you are concerned about their prices as they can be quite expensive for dinner trying giving their happy hour a try they call it their \"5 For $6 'Til 7pm\" in the bar area.",

    "text": "We ate here for Easter dinner with a special friend while on spring break. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food quality was very good. In fact, one member of our group ordered a petite filet, med rare. It was not cooked properly. The waiter took it back immediately and brought another. The replacement looked like a 10oz or 12oz. And they took it off the bill anyway. Dessert was great and our wine selection was perfect. Although we don't live in Scottsdale, I can recommend this location.",

    "text": "I asked an employee at the Arizona Golf Resort in Mesa for her favorite fancy restaurant in Scottsdale and she gave me a bum steer. Wine list is extensive (but heavy on the CA selections) and I found the ipad wine list hard to navigate. Waiter offered a tasting (quite small, not more than a couple of sips) and we requested a second and third and had to pay (a third of the cost of a glass per taste). Finally we chose a $56 bottle of Oberon after paying about 8 dollars for 2 tastes. Struck me as a bit greedy, considering the menu prices. I ordered French Onion soup -- very good altho not quite the traditional method (melted cheese over the pot) and partner had special soup of the nite -- a type of seafood, overpriced I thought at $14. Partner had the BBQ salmon which she said was \"fine.\" I ordered the smallest fillet mignon \"Newport\"  -- overpriced at $36 for something the size of a bar of soap (not the deodorant size; the kind you find for free in hotels). I ordered medium-well and it was medium-rare, and I found its seasonings/salt most disagreeable -- I kept tasting it again for hours afterward (sorry to say). Steak came with their house potatoes - kind of scalloped with cream and cheese and I did not care for the dish; the waiter was kind enough to remove it and offer french fries instead (which were fine). The waiter tried to be helpful but seemed rather inexperienced and hovered around too much. And the busboys were intrusive coming to collect plates seconds after it appeared we were finished with them. Manager offered a discount card on a future meal because I said we were celebrating an anniversary -- a nice touch but not enough to make up for the less than outstanding service, unsatisfying food and overall feeling that we were in one of a chain of restaurants (which we were) which lacked the exceptional quality I have come to expect from pricey places like this one. The price way exceeded the value of the experience. I must say the bread was excellent (but I was annoyed when busboys twice tried to remove the basket when the loaf was only half-eaten).",

    "text": "I had a great experience here. I started off with a cocktail - \"Romance\" it reminded me of an adios, but it was sweet and champagne based.   Had the seafood tower and it was yummy. Moved on to the main course of twin lobster tails. I wasn't thrilled with my lobster tails which seemed to taste like - steamed lobster. But my Mac n cheese, asparagus, and mashed potatoes sides were flavorful.   My only disappointment rises from when I asked the waitress which she recommended - Lobster en Fuego or Twin lobster tails. She picked the lobster tails and my friend got the Lobster en Fugeo. Her meal was to die for. I had 3 bites and I will never look at lobster tails again. I highly recommend getting the lobster en fuego. It's filled with flavor and so easy and clean to eat.   We ended with the chocolate lava cake, which was just as appeasing and appetizing as the rest of the meal had been.",

    "text": "A fairly well realized monument to unabashed corporate card excess, Fleming's dutifully enables the expense account crowd.         Food and service are sporadic and a poor value for anyone silly enough to be spending their own money here. My wife's tuna steak looked pretty, but was tough and fibrous. Salmon was satisfactory, but I can make better at home.   Underlings fully invested in steak grunted unanimous satisfaction at the appropriate times.   A hostess and bartender were both pleasant, charming even, however table service can be embarrassingly gushy (another reviewer mentioned ass-kissing).  This is the kind of place where bringing a pile of onion rings or a lettuce wedge to the table takes three chattering sycophants. We endured a flowery speech and unsolicited updates on lava cake, until it finally arrived half an hour after entrees were cleared. Hardly worth a wait.   The whole meal took forever, which in an attractive, upscale room is often confused with fine dining. Paul Fleming is a respected restauranteur, and rightly so based on my visits to his other kitchens. But I am not that confused.",

Everything was perfect, the food was amazing (main filet mignons, Fleming's Potatoes, Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Steamed Carrots) and we had the Chocolate Mousse Cake for dessert. I beg Fleming's to add this to their dessert menu permanently, it was amazing and had no nuts! Thanks again for another incredible celebration, we'll be back soon!",

    "text": "Ugh.  Went for a celebration dinner with my two kids.  we've been to Flemings in Peoria a number of times and always loved it. This experience was far from that.  Service was snooty and slow.  Took forever to get anyone to pay attention.  We ordered two kids meals and I had the petite filet, which, for $36, was so petite I left starving. I presented a $25 pre-paid gift card which I had paid for through our hotel stay at the nearby doubletree.  All of sudden, our waiter mysteriously disappeared with our bill for 15 minutes.  I complained to the manager and all he offered was to \"expedite\" the bill for me. No apology even.  Left a sour taste in my mouth.   Even so, it wasn't about the money.  I  I would go back to the west valley location in a minute because the experience is always fantastic.  At this location, they are just snooty, full of themselves, unfriendly and self-absorbed.  Oh and BTW, while the steak certainly wasn't bad, it wasn't heavenly either.  The wine I selected was sub-par and had no business being on the wine list for a restaurant of this supposed caliber.   And the kids meals included slices of apples as a first course.  Seriously?  They couldn't come up with something more creative than that?",

We got the Summer prix fix with the fillet mignon and that was a pretty good deal as it comes with a appetizer and dessert. The Prime Rib was very good and that also comes with a salad and dessert choice which made it a pretty good deal. The sides we got were corn and string beans, and they were just ok. For dessert, the prix fix comes with a banana creme broulet and that was good. For the prime rib (only served on sundays), you get to choose your dessert and I chose the Chocolate Layer Cake. It takes 20 minutes to prepare since it has hot fudge inside and it was pretty decent. We would definitely come back.",
