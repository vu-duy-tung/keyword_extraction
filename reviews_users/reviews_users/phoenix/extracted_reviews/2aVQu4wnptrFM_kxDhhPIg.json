I was not thrilled about this and let freshly know. I received an email telling me they would comp 100 percent of my next order which i thought was fair - however when i did get around to ordering from them; obviously i had reservations by now, i was in fact charged the full price.......i have written them back in regards to this but all in all this is not ok by me",

Compared to those, this service is really not good.  The portions are small and the last meal I just ate seemed like something from my high school cafeteria.  Like the mystery meat we all have experienced.  And, like others, I did not realize I needed to cancel/skip my next delivery until it was too late.  I received my first order on a Saturday and as of Sunday night they had charged me again for the next week and also giving me the same meals.  I didn't even get a chance to try them.  I would not have ordered the second week's worth.  The only reason I give them 2 stars is because the chili was actually quite delicious.  The rest, bland and meh. Stouffers lasagna is better.   If they improved the food, I could see where this service would be useful.  Esp. for old people and people totally on the go.",

I love the meals and customer service has been fantastic with promptly  crediting my account each time my meals arrived days late or not at all. Unfortunately, OnTrac is the only shipper Freshly uses for my area and they suck. If your shipper is FedEx go for it!  **************************************  Today my third week delivery is due, it's current 9:00pm and order is not here yet. Last week it arrived after 10:00pm and woke up my household and barking dog. I'm hoping I'll be able to request only FedEx delivery for future orders, if not I'll need to cancel my subscription. I'm not able to leave the package  outside over night due to living in the country with deer, coyotes, squirrels, possums & other critters.  The food is very good and packaged well. I could probably eat bigger portions but my reasons for ordering is portion control, low carb, quality food and variety. Freshly fits the bill! Hopefully, shipping issue can be resolved and I'll be a long time customer.",

In my head, I am the Mom who can spend hours roaming the aisles of Whole Foods reading labels. In reality, I am a hot mess who barely has time to shower. I pull up at work on 2 wheels and then burn rubber leaving the parking lot to pick up the kid and get her to gymnastics on time. I don't have time to cook healthy meals. Period! I tried food prep and Plated and found all that to be nice, but still a time suck.  Freshly takes all the label reading out of my shopping and guess work out of weeknight meals.  My favorite thing about this service is the list of 85 banned ingredients.  I feel good about what I'm feeding my family and that's VERY important these days. You never know what the heck you are eating. I save SO much time NOT going to the grocery store or cooking. Plus, I really end up saving money because I am not throwing all kinds of unplanned crap into the basket. I see people complaining about the lack of flavor.  It says right on the label to season it yourself.  Little sprinkle of this and that, pop it in the microwave and Bam! Dinner is served to your taste. Salt and pepper are usually enough for us.  I also see people talking about the meals going bad. Ummmm I guess they don't have freezers?  I don't get it.  Certainly, we have had a few that we didn't love, but there have been fast food and restaurant meals that we didn't love either. No biggie! We just don't order it again. We had one order that didn't get delivered and the customer service was awesome about it.  We didn't know what to do with ourselves without our Freshly meals that week.  We have really come to depend on the service and highly recommend it to anyone who has more desire to eat healthly than they have time to actually do it.  I think of it as Whole Foods meets, Kroger Click List meets Plated (or the likes) because they are strict about ingredients like Whole Foods, it's as convienent and time saving as click list and you get to try things that you may not cook otherwise like Plated.  Where Freshly wins is the fact that it's already cooked. That's hard to beat!  Keep up the good work Freshly!  And I have to mention that one reviewer who didn't like the service said to the company to be Nespresso instead of Keurig.  Funny thing is Nespresso is a Nestle brand who is also a stakeholder of Freshly.  LOL !  They are kinda Nespresso already. (Eyeroll)",

Some people even complain about the plastic covering the food. I just use a knife to cut it off. Not a big deal! The food is great plus it's gluten free. For those of us who have to avoid gluten, this is a dream come True. The food is fresh and much better for you than a typical frozen dinner. The delivery and convenience of microwaving the food is well worth the price. Plus the more meals you order the cheaper it is. I made a complaint about a side dish being too watery and they promptly refunded the price of that meal! They really do care. Give them a chance!",

    "text": "Last Chance Freshly. I wish I could tell you more about what the meals taste like, but I have not been getting them. The service might be great if you need no intervention from customer support. I guess. idk. They are nice, but so could not resolve a simple issue. I started my freshly order when I moved to new state-Ga. I made a simple request to see if my meals could be delivered for the upcoming week to my previous state of residence- TX- since I had to go back to move more items last minute notice. I said if they couldn't no biggie. Someone at my new home could freeze them or eat them for me. I told them it was just for that one week, all other meals to the original address as normal. They stated they couldn't change it in that short of notice. No problem. I updated my address for the following week back to my original home address as they advised, the same time I updated my meals. The meals went to Texas anyway?? I was told I updated it one location instead off another. There is only one location to update it (using a mobile  device-tablet) and when you do, it asks if you want this change for this order or all upcoming. Even if I didn't select to change the address back for all upcoming orders, it should have changed for that week. I did all this in response to the email they send that says you have so many hours/days to update the following weeks order. And I did it well before the deadline. So if nothing else, that week's order should have been going where I corrected it to go. Furthermore, if you say you can't adjust the address, WHY is the address adjusted??  I said if it can't be done for that week, its fine, just keep it. I'm baffled. All this on top of the fact that they kept emailing saying the meals weren't gonna be able to be delivered in time, but not to worry because the meals can last two days on the truck and 12 hrs outside. That means its not on a refrigerated truck. Gee, I feel so much better in knowing. Thanks. I'm also trying Christophe's in Atlanta for the first time this week. If the meals are better and actually come with minimal incident I'm telling all my friends I recommended to you this past week to ditch freshly for Christophe's. Better menu anyway. And they did offered  a refund. But, I don't want a refund. I want to eat.  *Extremely Aggravated and Hangry*",

We started to look in to the home delivery food services that send you your ingredients, but since I am not big on cooking, I kept searching and found Freshly! I love everything about this company!! From the neat packaging that your order comes in, to the food, to the pricing, to the convenience. This service gives you extra time in the evening to do what you want if you don't like spending your time cooking like me! Knowing that you are eating something that's healthy is the cherry on top. Also, if you don't eat your meal by the date listed on the packaging, you can freeze it so that it doesn't go to waste. My husband is usually picky with food and he has enjoyed everything we have ordered so far. Any time we have tried to clean up our eating habits in the past, our meals were very boring and bland which turned in to us going back to the unhealthy foods. Freshly keeps it interesting with all of their meals and it really has made us excited about eating healthy. Thank you Freshly!!!  ****For those who are giving this company a bad review based on your inability to  follow directions, that is all on you. The directions are all over the Freshly website as well as an email they send you after you purchase your meals. You have a certain day that you must either choose your meals by or pause your subscription, or it is assumed you want the same meals as your previous week. Do not give a bad review based on your own ignorance.****",

Prior to us leaving I put my weekly orders on hold.  They did not ship the food but they still charged my bank account.  I called customer service and was given one excuse after another. First they told me that I didn't put a hold on my deliveries.  I did.... and I printed it out so that I would have proof.  They even charged my bank account the $59.99 twice in one day. Then they told me they already credited the charges to me - they did not.  So how does that happen when the orders were put on hold?  Still waiting for a credit back to my bank account for their error.  I would NOT use their service again - not because the food was not good - only because of how they handled this situation.",

    "text": "I DESPISE cooking and seldom have the energy even if I could summon the interest. I love that Freshly offers food for singles - I don't need two portions. Every meal I've tried has more than enough food. I honestly don't know what people are talking about when they say portion sizes are too small. It's not huge, but you won't be hungry anymore. Maybe they're getting pasta and not chicken based recipes?  You do need to be aware that when you first sign up, you could be waiting a month before your first delivery. However, once you're \"set up\" and on their schedule, they make it very easy to skip weeks/alter your menu as needed.  I can't complain about food quality - the chicken is excellent and much better than chicken found in frozen meals I get in the grocery store. Freshly meals are a little heavy on the salt but are otherwise seasoned decently. The Buffalo Chicken probably needs a little help from your personal stash of Tabasco sauce.   My only issues are:  1) They need more vegetables. I like how much protein there is per serving but I could do with less starch and more broccoli. The Ranch Chicken has become a favorite merely because it has peas and broccoli patty things. (Yes, I know peas are a \"starchy\" vegetable.)  2) I haven't tried this yet but I'm going to have to. In my mind, if I order 6 meals then I'll have dinner for the next 6 days. Well, that isn't the case unless I freeze some. Because it's delivered refrigerated and not frozen, you do need to pay attention to the USE BY date. The only way(s) I can think of for them to get around this is to include a mid-week delivery day (increase in cost to consumers) or go to frozen (not as good). I've started looking for advice on which meals freeze better than others.",

I ordered (and paid) two weeks in advance and received an email two days ago saying my food had shipped.  There were no tracking updates available until 3:30 PM today when the shipping company suddenly claimed they never received the package.  Freshly refunded my order and gave me a credit towards my next purchase, but that does nothing for me when I now have no food for the week!!!  I went to the grocery store already today to get my fresh veggies, breakfasts, etc but now I have no time to go back to the store and prep meals for the entire week.  SUCH A LET DOWN!  Why offer convenience if you can't deliver?  If you can't make your deliveries, at least let you customers know in advance!!!   I had to reach out to customer service myself when I saw the tracking status 3 hours later (after waiting around for the delivery all day).  I will see what happens with my delivery next week, but I am furious with this company already.",

    "text": "Allow me to get straight to the point....  After having my first meal today (pork carnitas - which I've read is one of the better meals) I was going to score Freshly at 3.5/5 for what it is. However, after having spent the last 20 minutes in the bathroom with an upset stomach as a result of my first meal I am inclined to change the score to 2/5.   Taste: 3/5 - For what it is - a precooked meal in a box - not bad at all, could use some pepper.  Convenience: 2/5 - I don't understand the logic behind having 3 days to eat 6 dinners. Further, if I only have 3 days to eat 6 meals I'd much rather it come on Monday vs. Thursday when I'm entering the weekend and have time to prepare a meal.   How my stomach feels: 1/5 - None of the ingredients in the meal were foreign to my diet.   Price: 3/5 - Took advantage of the $40 off sale. approx. $6.60 per dinner isn't bad. But I doubt I would pay the full price of approx. $10/meal   Logistic: 2/5 - I didn't like the fact that I have literally 24hrs to place my order for next weeks delivery. What if I like a meal from this week and want to reorder it? (I suppose convenience also fits into this category).  I paid for it so I will try another meal tonight. Wish my body luck!",

I read some review of people complaining about the price. But clearly they don't do the math on how expensive it is to buy Ingredients for gourmet meals nor how much it cost to go out. It is cheaper than fast food meals multiple times a week as well. And did u mention how good they taste?! They're good for everyone and with cooking in three minutes?! Even a child could handle that. The company is super responsive. A while ago ppl complained the peals were too hard to get off. Well guess what they did? Changed it immediately so it was better for the costumer. All I am saying is. If you have a complaint, then maybe you're just a negative person looking to yell at the world!!!",

    "text": "Update on previous review: Megan followed up and they resent us our order. We were able to try a few before leaving town for 3 weeks - so we ended up freezing the meals (against their advice). After having been back and resuming their meals this past week, I can confidently say I've eaten enough to provide a thorough review.  Background I'm a foodie. And part of being a (serious) foodie is being able to appreciate foods in context. Fast food, Sit-down, Fancy, Michelin'd - they all have to have context. Don't let my lack of Yelp reviews fool you. I don't discriminate. I've eaten all.  Value (5/5 - for what it is) While we were off to a rocky start, I can say that Freshly's VALUE is pretty good, compared to the competition. They come in noticeably cheaper, with a decent preservation in quality. This is the saving-you-time-from-shopping, cooking, and cleaning value. That's IT. Don't expect super gourmet / personal chef / Michelin-starred quality from something that's designed to be reheated in your MICROWAVE! It's like the people complaining haven't seen or heard of Gordan Ramsay.  Ingredients (4.5/5 - for what it is) Reviews complaining about vegetables being \"dead\" really just have no clue, or have unrealistic expectations. Another review called these \"Over-priced TV dinners\" - TV dinner? Yes. Overpriced? Hardly.  Go through the supermarket's TV Dinner aisle... the last time I went, I certainly did NOT see any remotely-healthy TV-dinner offered with as much choice in ingredients. I guarantee you'll only see carbo-loaded options like: Pasta, Lasagna, Mashed Potatoes, Macaroni... etc. Always the same kind of chicken (usually fried) or meatloaf, vegetables' almost always simple corn or something.   I would put the ingredients of this higher than Lean Cuisine / its equivalent. This isn't miracle food. Just remember that it's microwaved-food and set your expectations accordingly. It's pretty decent.  Flavor (4.5/5 - for what it is) Personally, I think their flavor is just right in terms of sodium content vs. taste. People complaining that the flavor is too bland really need to use some imagination. Rice has no flavor? Hmm.. try eating the rice with some of that seasoned chicken that it came with. If you think you need to add more salt, then you're most likely someone who regularly consumes way too much sodium in their diet, and I would NOT trust your palate.  9 out of 10 Americans consume way too much sodium anyway. Asking Freshly to start off the meal with extra seasoning is asking them to take a hit on their nutrition facts with negative PR (why is sodium content is so high? because our customers love the taste of salt!).  Taste needs to be balanced with health. Freshly offers a nice compromise between the two.  Reliability & Convenience (2/5) The other reviews that I agree with (and unfortunately need to take a star away for) is due to their reliability.  Right now I'm 1 for 2 with them. I started off this updated review with 5 stars thinking my experience was just one-off, but after seeing other reviews complaining of the same thing, have ultimately decided to knock off 1 star because of their delivery/communication problems.  Additionally, the plastic film on their containers is weird. They tell you NOT to peel it, because it just stretches. They advise you to cut the film with a knife when microwaving and opening to eat. It's a little annoying to have to keep a knife on hand for this purpose (I just use my fork), but it is what it is.   If I decide to give this service another try (and the chances are high, after the holidays), I will evaluate and update the review with their shipping/communication performance.",

Received it in 4 days along with instructions on how to take care of it.(refrigerate, not freeze) The food arrived when they promised, everything was there,  packages were intact.Two days later, I got an email saying that if I didn't make any changes (as in cancelling or skipping a week) that my next order would be billed to my credit card in 3 days. I like that there doesn't seem to be any surprises with this company. I also like that I can skip a week which gives me time to actually try the food before deciding to stay with the same meals,  pick new ones or cancel.   I am impressed with this company. The meals are all tasty and interesting. Two minutes in the microwave and they are ready to eat. They weigh between 10 and 14 ounces and are very filling. (update-We didn't like the sweet potato hash or fries)   Customer service is excellent. Food is creative, tasty and filling. Our only concerns are while doing the math comparing how much it would cost to cook my own or go out to eat, (paying for food, gas and tip) how cost effective is this plan. Without a coupon it is $10.75 per meal.  And be aware while reading the nutritional values since there are a serving and a half in each package so divide accordingly for nutritional values.  THIS IS MY GO-TO PLACE FOR MEAL DELIVERIES!                                           * * *Update* * * Freshly is the fourth food delivery program that I have tried and my favorite. Personal Trainer Foods was also a meat and vegetable only plan and was my second favorite. They were a little cheaper but the food was unimaginative and in separate bags so a plate was always needed. The other was a plan in which I had to actually throw away some of the foods because of flavor and texture. Handpick was good but I had to prepare the meals myself with their ingredients.                                           * * *Update 7/15/2015* * * I tried the 4 day plan again as a diet plan instead of a meal plan this time. No added food and eating only their breakfast, (which were very tasty too) lunch and dinners. I didn't get hungry between meals, clean ups were a breeze and I lost 4 pounds in 4 days.",

I was so excited when my first delivery arrived yesterday.  I was especially excited for the Chicken Tikka Masala.  I love Indian food. I heated it following the instructions provided, and when I took my first bite I was incredibly disappointed.  I wanted flavor, and there was NONE.  I stirred it up thinking maybe the spice/flavor needed a good stir but to no avail.  I ended up throwing it away.  Why eat something with no flavor.  So I tried the Penne with sausage.  No flavor.  Then the Chicken breast with mac and cheese.  The chicken was tasteless?  How can this be?  The mac and cheese was mushy and had a bit of flavor but not much.  So they got tossed into the garbage.  I the tried the steak and mashed potatoes.  The steak had NO flavor at all.  The mashed potatoes tasted good.  So basically I paid the cost of 6 meals to get about 3/4 of a cup of mashed potatoes.  I cancelled my subscription immediately.",

The company practices social and environmental responsibility which is awesome. And you can't beat the convenience; I'm a single parent with a demanding full-time job, so I like the idea of my fridge being stocked with healthy, ready-made meals.   The taste, however, is inconsistent. There were some wonderful dishes (flat iron steak and maple quinoa porridge) and some not-so-great dishes (chicken rustica and garlic/herb shrimp). I don't have a particularly discerning palate; I'll eat almost anything. I just felt that there was a lack of flavor and some weird texture issues in about 50% of the meals.   Compared to any other microwave meal, the taste is far superior.  Compared to the competition (Blue Apron in this case), the quality is inferior. I liked everything I ever ordered from Blue Apron, but they ship raw ingredients that you have to prepare by hand, which is a pain. Freshly ships meals in easy-to-heat containers that take 2 minutes to prepare (plus an extra minute or so to get the plastic wrap off, that stuff CLINGS!).  At $10 per very small portion, I'm on the fence about whether I see value for the cost. I recognize that you don't have to re-order what you don't like, but I want to know that I can count on the food I'm purchasing to be consistently tasty. I'll probably order one more round then decide if it's worth continuing.  I'd recommend that Freshly continue improving and expanding on its recipes, and consider offering larger portion sizes for families. Clearly they listen to customer feedback, and I'm sure they'll take mine into account as they keep optimizing the customer experience.",

Anyhow It's not until I saw the individual meals in little frozen food plastic containers did the realization hit me that if you're gonna poke a plastic film, and microwave food placed in a plastic container it won't really be \"freshly\". Besides, this food was prepared at least 2 days before it got to me and  6 dinners would expire before 6 days were up, so unless I ate more than one dinner a day I'd be throwing away at least 2 meals.  I still gave it a shot and ate 3 of the 6 meals and while they all smelt very good they did taste like TV dinners.   Sadly, A better alternative = Lean Cuisine!",

Not everyone likes the same type of foods.   They are filling & 1000 times better than a store bought TV dinner.  Read the ingredients. We stay away from anything with certain spices or real spicy. Everything is shown on the page for each dish.~~~They are packed well when they arrive in a frozen type foam lining the sides & top & bottom. Always very cold when they arrive.  Not meant to be frozen, but can be. We prefer them not frozen as the veggies are better that way. ~~~Give them a try.  For the $39 introductory price, you can't go wrong.

    "text": "First: I got 3 meals...2 days later another 6! Had to throw out good food for room. I didn't order 2nd box...just wanted to try 1st. And too soon for it to come automatically. Food: Overall just plain bad. I really was looking forward to this service because I'm disabled, not suppose to cook (on oxygen) but a brief synopsis of what I have tried: Turkey with quinoa: thin stringy slices (2) of turkey on top of quinoa dressing. I like quinoa, but this had an unusual aftertaste...not pleasant. Flat ugly meal, not at all appetizing. Peppercorn steak: Nuked great, but suppose to stir potatoes halfway. Problem: steak on top of potatoes...have to pick up steak, stir potatoes and scoot them to one side. No separate compartment. I was really happy with steak (about medium) until I got to thicker center...too chewy and texture like tough liver. Carrots/green beans too tough/rubbery to eat. Shrimp scampi: WT*? Lots of water?wine? no taste, small shrimp and small almost pearl rice. Tried garlic and butter, but it was past saving. What's with all the watery liquid? Should have said to peel back or not used so much liquid.  I have 1 more steak dinner and a chicken masala? left from second order. Frankly, to be blunt I wish I'd thrown those out and kept my food. I'm not even tempted to try the chicken, but I will give steak one more chance because I threw out good food for these little entree boxes. Biggest disappointment. Way overpriced for amount of product or quality. Customer service was good...initially he credited me with 2 both weeks, but then charged me for one of the weeks.  Pro: One meal was the breakfast of scrambled eggs, sausage. It was good, but c'mon, can't throw us a biscuit in there? I didn't want to cook a whole can of them!   I know this is a harsh review. But I've tried Blue Apron, Marley & Co. Hello Fresh and even Plated, which I gave most all away because my lack of desire to cook. I set high unattainable goals, at times. And the amount of food in 3 of those were worth the money. Marley & Co. recipes I ordered (I should have believed the recipe pictures)...too time consuming and not appetizing to me. Regretted buying them. I read this is part of Marley & Co...I can easily believe it. I'm sticking with my limited home cooking for about $2.00 for 3 meals.",

    "text": "Freshly has been a total lifesaver for me. I work full time and go to school full time so I barely have time to breath. I hated meal prepping because it was so time consuming and I would end up eating the same boring food everyday. How much grilled chicken and salad can you eat? I was so disgusted with how boring my diet had become and I would end up just caving and buying fast food and other unhealthy crap. Also, I hated spending half my day off just cooking chicken breast and chopping vegetables. My day off is the only chance I have to basically sleep and relax. I signed up for Freshly because the meals looked good and they are mostly pretty healthy. I have had my subscription for about a month now and I have not had any meals that I didn't like. It is convenient because I bring 2 of them to work each day. One for lunch and then I eat one for dinner right before school. My only option before was hitting up the school cafeteria and getting a burger and fries.  This service has been amazing and I don't think I could survive without Freshly anymore. I don't have to cook, grocery shop or clean dishes anymore. I can just eat healthy meals that taste good without thinking about it anymore. This gives me more time to focus on school instead of worrying about what I am going to eat for lunch the next week. The meals are quite filling because they are pretty generous with the protein portion which I appreciate because I am a big guy so I need a hefty meal to feel satisfied. The price is a little bit high, but the trade off is that I don't go out to eat anymore since I don't need to. I signed up for the 12 meals a week plan so I have my lunch and dinner for the whole week.  My only suggestion to Freshly would be to find a way to reduce the price a little bit. I think if you could do 12 meals for $99.99 it would be better and also if they did healthy little desserts for like $10 extra a week or something that would be cool. I'm thinking like healthy protein balls or chia seed puddings and stuff. Also, a side note, the ancho turkey chili is AMAZING. Best chili I've ever freaking had!  It is sad about the negative reviews people post about the subscription model. You guys are not very smart if you didn't read and understand that its a weekly plan. They send you email reminders to pick your meals or skip the week if you need to. You have to understand they have a business to run and have to appropriately allocate labor and product to be prepared so they have no choice but to have a deadline for each week's meals. If you are a busy college student like me and are finding yourself hitting the drive-thru too often then I highly recommend Freshly. I love these guys and I hope they never get rid of that Turkey Chili. And no, I'm not being paid to post this review (I wish I was), I just feel that this service has benefited me tremendously and am so happy I discovered it.",

    "text": "Sort of surprised to see such harsh reviews, I think freshly is really good. I would probably give it 4 stars (mostly just because of price), but I think I need to give them 5 because they are looking under-appreciated here.  I actually freeze my meals so I don't feel pressured to eat them right away and they are still great. Haven't done any of the breakfast or fish dishes, but the chicken, steak, and pasta ones are on point. Originally I just wanted to do the promotional deal, but after I was pleasantly surprised with my first 6 I've now ordered 3 more times.   I wish they were a little cheaper, but they are still very good and easier / healthier than what I'd be eating otherwise. Steak Peppercorn is probably my fav. Folks seem to be expecting gourmet cooked dishes from a microwave, but as far as microwaved dishes go, these are as good as it gets.",

    "text": "TLDR - Great service for those that like/ are used to microwavable/TV dinners or have a busy schedule. Definitely healthier and fresher than other frozen meals. As far as meals itself, they leave a lot to be desired considering the portion size (not adjustable) and cost.   Was looking at alternatives to cooking for weeks when I'm too busy and don't really want to eat at a restaurant and came across Freshly and managed to get a $30 for 6 meals coupon so figured it's worth it to at least try. Looking at the meals, I did see that they were microwaveable. Though I'm not the greatest fan of microwaved meals, I did want to give them the benefit of doubt and try out the meals.  Ordering: Very simple and straight-forward. Enter your zip so that you know you can receive it, choose how many meals in a week (6-21), the delivery date, and the meals you want. Looking at the menu compared to the order sheet, the only complaint is that the sizes were different than what I received. Looking at the menu on the week I had my food, it did match so there might be some difference there.  Delivery: Had it delivered to my building and while the box was big, they claim everything is recyclable. Food was chilled properly and packaged neatly so no issues there.  Presentation: Meals were in their own containers and protein and veggies are separated. Only issue was the wrappers were difficult to get off. This has been stated in many reviews and there is supposedly a fix coming.   Food itself: I ordered 6 meals as follows: - Asian-Style Steak With Vegetable Stir-Fry - 3/5 - Beef Provencal With Polenta and Roasted Vegetables - 4/5 - Chicken Milanese With Braised Green Beans  - 2/5 - Chimichurri Salmon With Succotash - 3/5 - Roasted Turkey With Apple, Almond Butter Gravy - 2/5 - Garlic & Herb Shrimp - soul crushingly horribly/5  Overall, the food was really lacking to me. Sauces had separated partially so there was a colored liquid and colored textured portions separated. Having the sauces in separate packets would help this. While most of the meals tasted decent and did taste fresh, the vegetables were not too happy to be microwaved and most of the protein portions were underflavored. Being healthy doesn't mean you can't have flavorful meat.   I did want to call out two meals to show the difference between them. Beef Provencal - Great meal overall with some small callouts. The vegetables were in no way roasted and boiled instead. Whoever thought it was a good idea to boil brussels sprouts should be force fed them. Roasting them greatly improves the flavor, or at least does for me. The Polenta tasted fantastic but had an almost chunky and separated texture, especially once mixed with the remaining sauce from the beef.  Garlic & Herb Shrimp - Honestly, tasted like something repackaged from Lean Cuisine style meals. Vegetables were mushy, shrimps had no seasoning and were very rubbery/chewy, and the whole meal lacked flavor that was anything but depressing.   For $30 for 6 meals, it would be worth the service. Good variety and decent flavor for most meals and definitely a step up from other microwaveable meals. For $70, way too overpriced in my mind, especially for such small sized portions. I know it's not the target audience but you can make these meals for the same if not lower price, adjust it to your liking, and actually have a fresh cooked meal. For now, canceling the service and going back to home cooked meals.  For consumers, if you're used to microwaveable meals or need something that's quick and easy, it's worth a look to see if it's something you like. For Freshly, giving the option to cook the meals and separate the sauces, it will definitely improve the service.",

    "text": "My customer experience with this company was terrible and it only lasted 48 hours. As a customer care professional, I was shocked at the response to my customer support inquiry after my first delivery. I had only tasted one meal after about 48 hours and was notified that I was already 5 hours too late in editing my meal options or pausing my delivery for my second week's delivery.  I was charged for a full second week, was not offered to reschedule and was flat out denied a any refund for something that I have not even received and isn't even close to being shipped out. So disappointing, especially at a time when I still paid to try them out while other competitors are offering free trials with much better customer support and follow-up.  Needless to say, this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I wouldn't recommend Freshly, and it's unfortunate that I was not allowed ample time to really evaluate the product before being charged a second time.  I will repeat the following tip (previously mentioned by another reviewer): \"TIP: After placing your first order, immediately put a hold on all additional weeks until you try and decide if you want to continue. Freshly one requires NINETY-SIX hours (four whole days) notice in order to change or cancel any service, which is barely enough time to even eat what they ship before another one is on it's way.\"",

The food was ok and I looked forward to finding my favorites over the next few weeks though there was a payment issue with my old address on my card and contacting customer service 4-5 days before a Saturday shipment was not enough time to allow for \"maximum freshness\" and blah blah blah. I was unconvinced as to why they needed more than a 4-5 day window to reactivity my weekly subscription. Are these measles prepared that far in advance? If so perhaps I am glad that I canceled! After reaching out to customer service three times they were unwilling to accommodate so I took that as a sign and canceled (though they were very helpful on providing specific cancelation instructions after not addressing my concern and trying to keep me as a customer! - one star for that.

He opened the refrigerator and immediately took the steak out microwaved it and ate the whole thing... veges and all. For a picky eater, I was shocked. Throughout the next few days he managed to eat almost all the meals, only saving a turkey meal for me, which was very good.

    "text": "Disclaimer: my family and I are recreational eaters, so we've tried just about everything on earth.  We ordered a 6-meal pack with the following to get a taste of the full spectrum of dish types: --Peppercorn Steak --Chicken Parmesan --Sausage & Green Chile Frittata --Quinoa Porridge --Chicken with Asparagus Risotto --Paleo Beef Chili  PROS: --Beautiful website that's easy to manage without help --Convenient and reliable shipping --Stupid-proof reheating instructions --Nice packaging/labeling  CONS: --Of that list the only one we actually enjoyed was the sausage and green chile frittata.  Every other dish ranged from disgusting to mediocre. --There is so much packing material.  Even though it's recyclable I can't help but feel it's a huge waste of money that could be put towards making the food better. --Spices were nowhere near balanced.      *For the love of Pete, add some salt to these recipes    *The paleo chili is so thick and over-spiced you could have cut it in half with water and it would still have been a pretty powerful stew.      *The other dishes just had no flavor whatsoever. --Everything was way overcooked.    *Chicken grill marks had an excessively burnt/carbon taste that destroyed the whole dish    *All the chicken dishes were dry/stringy    *All the proteins were huge slabs and were a pain to cut while in the tray    *Every rice and pasta dish was just a hair away from turning into mush    *Vegetables were flavorless and overcooked/mushy  VERDICT:  Don't be fooled by the gorgeous packaging and website.  The food (which is really the only thing that matters in the end) is unacceptable and is not worth the wait or expense.  I'd rather double up on LeanCuisines at my local grocer, it would taste better and be cheaper and I get gas points.  Sorry Freshly :(",

By \"the best,\" I truly mean within the context of these meal-delivery kits. It can't beat home cooked or restaurant prepared meals; to expect that from a 3 minute microwavable is unreasonable. Sure, it's a bit bland sometimes but is grabbing salt and pepper really that hard? (or Freshly, if you could pack some little things of spice, that would make this perfect)  It's better (and healthier) than 3 minute instant noodles or delivery pizza. You get a variety of options to choose from. They outline and detail every calorie and list all nutritional contents to let you know what is going in your body. Instructions are easy; just pop it in a microwave.  Lastly, I love that the packaging is fully recyclable and biodegradable. It's also not overly excessive, except for the necessary ice packs. Delivery has been fine so far, even though I live in a dorm and it has to go through a unified mail room.  I'll be ordering for the rest of the semester. :)",

Here is our journey through food subscription:  Blue Apron: tried and cancelled We tried Blue Apron for 3-4mths and found the food prep times oppressive, though the food was great.  It was much easier to shop at a grocery store and make a big meal for the week than the daily 45-min investments in cooking Blue Apron meals  Hello Fresh: considered it as an alternative to Blue Apron The menu was too limited, and while cooking times were quoted at sub-30min, didn't understand why that was much better than the 45-min for a Blue Apron dish.    Freshly: happy customers for 6 months! It's the same price as Blue Apron, equally healthy, has decent variety, tastes great, and has ~3min of prep time.  Their delivery has been reliable 98% of the time, and the one time when not they discounted the order and the food came 1 day late.  It is one of the highest ROI investments I've made -- we save 20-40min a day of food prep time and 40min a week of shopping time for a cost that is inline with other meal subscription services and probably just slightly more than going to the grocery store!",

I like how all meals have a different flavor profile and are generally healthy because gluten free healthy meals that taste good are not easy to find. My experience with Factor 75 was regrettable and I'd recommend this service over Metabolic Meals.  I haven't loved all the meals, but most are very good. The first one I ate (peppercorn steak) was disappointing with overcooked and grisly meat. The chopped chicken isn't the best quality, but chicken breasts seem okay. I'm also not a fan of whatever potatoes they use. I would recommend both fish meals along with the chicken mac, turkey with relish,  Korean bibimbap, and pork carnitas. Pass on the chili, country chick mash, and spaghetti squash.   The website is also very well done and easy to use. I really appreciate that you can skip weeks and changing your order is not complicated.",

Received email after 6:00 pm that the order MIGHT not show up. Mind you it is usually delivered by 6:00 pm. They clearly cannot keep up with business which means they will start cutting corners, not something you want in a food preparation company. If they cannot deliver they should not accept subscriptions. I have cancelled mine so maybe it will help someone else get there food as promised.  The other issue is that the expiration dates are usually 3 or 4 days after delivery (not good if you want for a week). They suggest freezing as a solution which is counter to the reason for using them. I looked past this but am done now. Don't trust the business.",

The shrimp one was ok and better when we added hot sauce. All around we are completely dissatisfied and will not be ordering from them again.

Out of those 4 weeks twice I got an email saying the food was arriving late and would not be safe to eat.  No charge for the failed deliveries, and they offered a 20% discount on next order.  Out of the last 10 reviews i just read, it seems most others have had the same experience.    The food is good enough and a nice value if it arrives in time, but it is so sad to think that half of all this food is wasted.  Not to mention all the packaging materials that are thrown out each week.  I called customer service and they said they can't provide and info on how often this happens.  But after reading other recent reviews, it seems wayyy too often.    This company is an environmental disaster, not to mention it is frustrating to plan your week around receiving meals and then not know until the day they are supposed to be delivered that it often does not show up in time to be safe to eat.

If you hype up something mediocre enough I guess enough people will believe it and follow the bandwagon.  Total waste of money hopefully can get our money back and can get Stouffer's instead.  Update: tried the beef stew and it was decent and better than the prior rubber Turkey meal so upped it one star.",

At first I was worried with the price..... but they offered me an intro for 2 weeks for $39.99 -- Smart move Freshly, very smart!  I am an accountant so my number crunching brain had to break it down for my cost, here is my analysis:   1. Time spent hunting for creative, healthy and easy meals:           Time cost = $67.50 2. Going to the store to buy groceries:          Time cost: $45 3. Wine I will have to buy after fighting crowds of annoying people:         Cost: $15 4. Prepping food and cooking for a whole week:           Time cost $90  Opportunity cost:  $217.50 + $50 groceries for 1 = $267.50 per week.   Freshly breakdown:  15  min to select or change meals:            Time cost $11.25  Opportunity Cost:  $11.25 + $59.99 food = $71.24   I am saving $196.26 a week.........  $10,205 a year!!!   And the flavor, I personally could not cook this well.  I expected much less quality than what I got. This beef stew tastes like my grandma cooked it all day.    LOOOVE how I can sort the meals by dietary needs, BLESSING!  The portion sizes are great for me as I am trying to loose the desk job/ study weight.  When I get to the point of wanting to build more muscles, I will go for the higher cal- higher protein selections.   I have looked into many meal services, but they never lived up to my dietary needs.   I  honestly do not even know how I stumbled up on it, but I have recommended it to everyone I know.",

I love that it's soooo convenient, yet prepared freshly (hah!). All the dishes I've had so far (~10) are delicious (actually can't pick out one I dislike, maybe the Southwest Veggie bowl if I had to pick one), and makes my body feel amazing afterwards. I also love that good nutritional knowledge went into the recipes so they are low in artificial sugar and other bad for you things, as explained on the packaging of each meal. I think if I continue to eat 2 freshly a day with a small snack, I will be able to stay under 1200cal/week, which would allow me to eat healthy and loose 1lb a week. Perfect!",

    "text": "I spent more time than I want to admit researching meal delivery services. I'm very happy with Freshly so far and will update my review if anything changes or I have more to add. I saw the negative overall rating and was worried, but I think they must have stepped up their game recently. Here's why I chose Freshly over the others I was considering, which included anything from frozen to fresh to easy meal kits (15 minutes or less prep). So this comparison included Munchery, Factor 75, Fresh n Lean, Gobble, BistroMD, Fresh Chef, and MagicKitchen. Others were even more expensive.  If you don't give a hoot about health or high carb/high sugar food, eating tons of gluten, etc, Freshly might not be for you. But I promise this doesn't taste like diet food (it's not), and it's actually still cheaper than the less healthy competition, surprisingly. I calculated plan costs for pretty much every offering out there, and all were either close to the same or more expensive. Now, I'm NOT celiac or Paleo, but I eat moderately healthy - less so when I'm extremely busy, which I will be very soon...thus the subscription. I do have a gluten sensitivity, though (I get bloated and foggy brained when I have a lot of it), so I really wanted a place that had lots of low gluten options, without being strictly Paleo (sorry, but I love my dairy and legumes...especially dairy!!) There isn't as much cheese as I'd like in the Freshly menu, but at least there's some. :)  I was only going to get this for the upcoming crazy-busy month or two, but I can already tell that the time it saves me just might make it worthwhile.   CONS: -They really need to offer Monday or Tuesday deliveries to Seattle! We're a big enough city! I don't want my deliveries at the end of the week when weekdays are when I'm busiest...  -I do wish they'd have more seafood options, but I understand that it's hard to ship those. -I'd love even more cauliflower rice and spaghetti squash base options instead of the carbs, although they're still better than most other places I considered in that regard. :(",

I can get a big bag of frozen chicken breasts and pop in the air fryer along and buy a bag of frozen veggies to microwave for the cost one Freshly meal. Food for a week if I  choose.   I have found the customer service to be very responsive.",

I do wish you could customize meals because the cod cakes are amazing but the potatoes don't cook well in the microwave.  Packaging is all recyclable which is great.  I didn't realize how much packaging there would be though (insulation and 2-3 big ice packs that are recyclable). Meals run at about $10/meal which is more expensive than cooking at home but cheaper than eating out. Food is low calories and delicious, but does have a high sodium content.   You have the option to microwave your food in a plate or in the tray it comes in and tastes like a fresh cooked meal!  Breakfast is not worth it outside of the berry porridge.    Best food delivery system I've ever used.",

    "text": "I'm really disappointed in this service. We've been using Freshly for almost a year, and it started off great. However, we've had a number of issues during that time, including food poisoning from their shrimp/scallop risotto, meal substitutions without our approval, extremely poor cuts of pork/beef with excessive grizzle (we're talking half the protein being straight flabby fat), and now they're quietly shrinking meals and using cheap filler so they can say the oz are almost the same. For example, we loved their sausage/peppers dish when first introduced. It was full of sausage and peppers, and was only like 450 calories. The package came in a divided dish, with riced cauliflower on the other side. Then, after a few weeks, it arrived all mixed together and there was like 6 tiny slices of sausage and the rest was cauliflower and peppers. It also dropped to 380 calories. When I complained about this, I was told they're trying to cut calories on their dishes. This is bull, and I'll tell you why: they always try to fly these \"improvements\" under the radar, by sneakily shrinking the dish gradually over a few weeks. (I have yet to receive an email blast informing all their subscribers that they're sending half the food at the same high ask price). They're just trying to cut costs on the more expensive components. This dish was already low calorie!  This is supposed to be dinner?! On what, a 1200 calorie a day diet?! I'm not a 14 yo girl, and neither is my husband. I didn't sign up for a diet plan. I  signed up for a meal service. 500-700 calories is acceptable for dinner. Having to make side dishes on our own to feel satiated isn't making our life easier, which is the whole point of a meal service.    I use this dish as an example, and if it was only this dish, I'd get over it. However, if you pay attention, they do this to most of their dishes. Their shrimp risotto (now always without scallops, which I'm guessing is because we weren't the only ones to get food poisoning) is a joke. It's half the size it used to be.  Pay attention to dishes, and take photos every (and I mean every) time you order; you'll see what I'm talking about yourselves.  In the end, the only thing that saved them from cancelling our weekly 12 meal plan subscription is their customer service, which is nice, helpful and quick to offer credits for bad service. But, we've had it. The Freshly experiment is over. May it die a quick death. We've switched to the 6 meals for a few weeks, and then we're cancelling. We live in Chicago. There are plenty of other meal services to choose from.",

The packaging was designed horribly so it was a pain to open the seal. I was hoping I can get a full refund because I wasn't satisfied, but I was told that I can only get 25% refunded. Definitely won't recommend this to others.",

It really does make a difference if you cook it on a plate rather than the container that they come in. And shipping cost is included, unlike some other food meal delivery services out there. It's also nice getting 6 individual meals rather than 3 meals that feed 2 people, since I live alone. And can't forget to mention, the customer service is OUTSTANDING! I had a problem with the actual delivering company (whether it be USPS, FedEx, or UPS) not delivering my food on time and Freshly refunded my order and gave me credit for my next order, despite it not even being their fault. Very impressed by everything about the company and highly recommend!",

I started with the porridge for breakfast. Although I really loved the texture, the flavor was very blan. I didn't even eat 1/2 of it because it was just that boring. My taste buds were lulled to sleep and went limp. I broke off a corner of chocolate muffin and was disappointed but not discouraged. The grainy texture was edible, but I didn't enjoy the flavor so the muffin went into the trash with the majority of the boring porridge. I was excited give my taste buds a treat and tried the buffalo chicken for lunch. Once again I am underwhelmed with the taste. The chicken tastes like it is processed and it's appearance looks processed as well (see photo.) The mashed cauliflower has decent flavor but should have a more \"whipped\" and less dense consistency.  I promise I'm not a flavor snob. I also am quite certain my taste buds aren't asking for too much! Outside of the easy heating instructions and ease of using the Freshly app for ordering, this venture has been a complete bust. Guess I'll hit the vending machine for something to eat for lunch as I won't be finishing my 2nd Freshly meal of the day (sad face).  **Update 5/2/18. The app is very user friendly and the customer service agents are very competent. I had no problems cancelling my subscription and received a very welcome message regarding my Yelp review. Kudos to the customer service team. If only the recipes were as great!",

The meals can be tasty (depending on which you order) but are inconsistent with the quality of each meal and seemed like the cooks cared less with each week. The quantity is under what I believe it should be for the price (an overall judgement, one or two seem barely justifiable for price), the main course is often overwhelmed by the sides in regards to the portion. The \"main\" sides that should count such as rice and potatoes are often lacking. Overall I think there is a good concept here but the value isn't there as advertised.  I do have to say that the chili has incredible flavor and I was impressed by that, however the meal being only be a few spoonfuls conjured up some major disappointment. Chili being rather inexpensive to make should have at the very least matched the size of the other meals.",

There have been a few times when I've been really hungry and a single Freshly meal hasn't quite filled me up, but eating a second meal would have been way too much food.

    "text": "I normally work at home, so dinner isn't too much of a problem. But when I got word that I'd be on a 4-6 week project requiring a 90 minute commute in each direction, I started scrambling for solutions.   I'd done Blue Apron and Hello Fresh in the past, and the food was tasty. But the amount of time required to cook those meals was a nonstarter. (The effort to payoff ratio is way skewed with those services!) I needed something faster - without resorting to frozen dinners and takeout. Enter Freshly.   Pros:  - Freshly does solve my time problem very well. These dinners take minutes to cook.  - They taste good, too. They're not amazing, but you're not going to get fine dining in a box delivered to your front door. What you get for the price is a solid meal. I haven't had a dud yet.  - The calorie counts are reasonable. This was another problem with Blue Apron - one meal would be 750 calories. And you'd be so darn hungry by the time you finished the epic journey to get the thing cooked that you'd eat it all. My Freshly meals have been closer to 400 calories. This fits into my life much better. I'm 40, I unfortunately can't scarf down 750 calories for dinner and expect my pants to fit the next day. - It's only been two weeks, but my deliveries have been reliable and on time.  - Because the meals are not frozen, you can take them out of the plastic tray for reheating. And all the meals come with instructions for doing so. I don't like to heat plastic around my food, so this is a big plus.  Cons: - Variety. This is the biggest drawback for me. My husband and I are pescatarian - meaning we eat fish, but not poultry or land animals. The selection of Freshly meals that fit into our diet is very small. Each week we order, we get the same things. Not because we're so attached to those meals, but because there are literally no other options we can eat. This is fine for the 4 or 5 weeks I expect to use this service, but it rules out using it for the long haul. On week four, one of our usual meals is retired and replaced with a new one - the cod cakes becomes salmon cakes. I mean, technically that's a change, but barely. I do feel for the company - meeting everyone's dietary restrictions is hard. But that doesn't change the result for people like me. - Packaging. The meals come in a box full of these giant ice packs. They're not really practical to keep and re-use, and the company doesn't want them back. So you've got to throw them out. My city only gives me a tiny garbage cart and these ice packs, along with the other packing material (recycled denim) take up half the room in there. Yes, I'm glad you can recycle the plastic bags and plastic trays, and it's good that the ice pack gel is water soluable. I do think they are really trying. But it's still too much waste. I can live with it for a few weeks but again, the long haul would be a problem. Can't all the brilliant minds in the world come up with a better solution than these ice packs? - Delivery. I have gotten my meals on time so far, which is great. But the first week, Freshly sent me an email apologizing that the carrier didn't deliver my meals. Since I did get the meals it wasn't an inconvenience - but it did suggest there are significant communication problems between Freshly and the carrier (in my case, FedEx.)   All in all, Freshly meets my needs and the time saved cooking has absolutely been worth the price they charge. It's a good service. With a few tweaks and some operational upgrades, it could be a great service. I'd recommend it on the whole.",

The \"slow cooked beef chili\" had ZERO flavor (might as well have come from a can), and the \"braised rosemary pork\" was also bland... with no hint of rosemary oddly enough. Honestly, they could improve everything dramatically by just adding herbs and spices. The problem is there is no flavor, no complexity - no pop.  Yes, the idea is good and the marketing savvy... also the website and customer service seem well-managed. But the bottom line is - it's food. Food has to taste good. Unless they integrate good recipes, they'll never survive.",

Completely unreliable which is the entire point of paying for a meal service.  As fast as they're losing customers and as bad as their reputation has become, it won't be a surprise if they soon become the next 'Munchery'",

So far there has been one week that the meals were not delivered; I was notified in advance that this was to be the case. I would rather be informed that the meals were unable to be sent than to receive subpar meals. I have yet to eat a meal I was not pleased with. The food is flavorful and all the meat is juicy and not dry in the least. It is worth not listening to the reviews and giving it a try.  Especially since you can cancel anytime. Chicken risotto, homestyle chicken and bbq shredded beef has been my favorites thus far. The rest are close seconds. Will post new review after longer term trial.",

The ONLY complaint that I can give would be a suggestion that they add more low-carb keto options to their menu.

The meals arrive fully cooked and are kept cool in a well insulated box with earth friendly gel packs to keep them at a refrigerated temperature. They can go right into your fridge for later or pop one in the microwave for about 3 minuets and your dinner is ready. If you don't think you'll be eating them within the designated time listed on the package you can just freeze them and eat them when you're ready.   This service is perfect for anyone who would enjoy ~ reasonable portioned, restaurant style meals at home that are ready in minuets ~ skipping the grocery shopping, meal prep, clean up and storage of leftover ingredients (that often go to waste) ~ and having it all hand delivered to your doorstep by a very nice person. If you're on the fence about trying Freshly use coupon link <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frefer.freshly.com%2Fs%2FJodi98&s=843e6c65c87b0d3a954c829a026ea0439019bcd07bf27f98d8318cdf62cf959f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">refer.freshly.com/s/Jodi...</a>  to get $20 off your first week AND another $20 off your second week AND free shipping forever.  A truly great deal to see if you like the service.  On a side note, Freshly pairs so well with another company called Daily Harvest. They specialize in \"super foods\" smoothies, chilled coffees, soups and \"fits in a cup\" sized meals.  An entree from Freshly paired with a smoothie from Daily Harvest makes for a deliciously healthy, fruits and veggies packed, filling meal.  Don't pay full price though ~ use code RE-D4LY7L4 to get yourself 3 free cups on your first order AND free shipping forever at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.daily-harvest.com&s=f6b4c2e5161b84fd1e7ed6f7941f7cfc3e9f312d3fb2401956abb1fa068f1318\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">daily-harvest.com</a>",

Wound up tossing the whole thing, because why flirt with fate?   Little did I know that a few days later I would get taken down by another meal which I finished in full, the Buffalo Chicken entree. Within a few hours of consumption I started to feel ill, and wound up with food poisoning, which till today is still acting up.

The size of these meals is more of a wake-up call to how ridiculously huge American restaurants' meals have become over the years. By the forth meal I was becoming satisfied with the reduced portions. These are higher quality than the vast majority of even the ~$5+ top frozen diners but not quite up to restaurant level, this is a bit disappointing as the price is in fact up to restaurant level after shipping. At the introductory price it is well worth the small extra cost for fresh meat, the beef dishes in particular taste noticeably better not having been frozen. At the regular Freshly price, I would probably stick with entrees from Evol and Trader Joes. It is a close call and to be fair, convenience isn't worthless.

The meals I tried were cauliflower & sausage and the beef chili. They are delicious enough for the price and convenience.  The problem is that two out of three weeks of service have required me to contact customer service twice because of delivery issues. The first issue was my box had five meals but they charged me for six. How do you just forget to pack a meal? I worried a bit about attention to detail and quality control, but no matter.  The following week, my shipment never arrived, but they charged my credit card anyway. When I finally called, they apologized and said that it would arrive three days late and the food would need to be thrown out, as it had expired. That's when I canceled.   I tried this service to save time. I need reliability. I don't have time to chase down refunds every week for their mistakes. And I don't like that I never got any communication from them about the late delivery. Do they just charge your card and hope nobody notices?  They get an extra star for 1) trying. Gluten-free kitchen is great. I did not get cross contaminated from this service. 2) Refunding my money without argument and offering a 50% discount on my next delivery. 3) Recyclable packaging.

    "text": "The first subscription arrived on time. Food tasted okay, I wouldn't say something great. I realized I could probably cook the same type if not better meals at home. But anyways, the whole idea of having Freshly is to cut down time on cooking when you're having busy weeks. The second delivery on the day before Thanksgiving never showed up, they emailed me it would be delivered the next day. Nothing, no emails and I understand it's holiday, so why commit something you know you can't deliver? I am cancelling my subscription and will probably check out other options for ad hoc needs.",

    "text": "I've only gotten a few boxes so far but for someone like me, who doesn't want to cook, these meals are great.  The $10 per meal seems to be kind of an industry standard--well, same price as Blue Apron--but I don't have to cook anything so the labor alone is worth the $10.  The portions are good, the flavors are great.  I prefer low-carb and they have a good number of options.  I can see it getting a bit monotonous after awhile but they seem to add new meals fairly often.  Like Blue Apron, the packaging is crazy, but I'm not sure how you fix that.  The big frozen gel packs are a hassle to dispose of.  But I've enjoyed the meals, and the ability to eat healthy and not have to cook.  I'm amazed they always come out of the microwave evenly heated up.  No cold spots.  Didn't have any delivery issues. Their website is really simple to use--easy to pick out meals. I'll keep it up as long as I can afford it and the food tastes good.  I would imagine one of the biggest challenges of these subscription food services is to keep people interested in the long term by changing things up.  I hope they can find a way to do that.",

The food taste great, and it is as easy as warming up in the microwave for 2 minutes. No clean up, no cooking no mess. I wish they had more options as they only change one item per week, I can see myself getting tired of it, but hey, if I can feed my family with natural ingredients and preservatives as easy as I am able to do so with Freshly, then hey.. its great in my book!",

    "text": "I absolutely LOVE freshly!!  Honestly, I am shocked at all of the poor reviews (seriously, ignore those complainers)- you're receiving a refrigerated meal through the mail that you microwave, of course it's not going to taste 5-star restaurant fresh, but honestly, it's pretty damn close!  Aside from the turkey (I advise not starting with that one), my husband and I have loved all of the meals we've tried.  His favorite is the pork carnitas, and my staples are the buffalo chicken and the chicken parm.  They're both under 500 calories and under 20 carbs (great for a low carb, calorie diet).  I wish they'd offer more low carb dishes for around 400 calories though. Most of the time the chicken is juicy, although sometimes you will get a dry piece here and there (oh well).  The mashed cauliflower is AMAZING and healthy - it's a win, win!  I wish I could order this in bulk... I would serve it on the reg for dinner. The peppercorn steak was surprisingly good and juicy - again, you just microwaved a steak, so not the best steak you've ever consumed, but wonderful considering you prepped for under 5 minutes... and you're getting to eat guilt free steak. My husband and I both work crazy hours and want to avoid going out to eat for lunch and meal prepping lunches - $10 for lunch isn't ideal, but it's cheaper and healthier than going out.  We both eat three per week for lunch.  If we don't use one before the expiration date, we throw it in the freezer for the weekend or following week.  If you crave simple, healthy and tasty meals, and you don't mind shelling out $10 each, this is the service for you!  Highly recommend!!",

    "text": "Freshley was new to my area and was offering a $20 discount for the first 2 weeks of meals. I signed up on January 1st and saw that the first available Saturday delivery date was Jan. 26, which I chose. It seemed a long time to wait but I figured it was more of a pre-order situation since they were just starting to deliver in the region. On 1/18 I received an email that due to an \"upcoming winter storm\" they had to cancel my order (which was confusing as there was no winter storm in my area at the time). They refunded me and gave me a $20 credit, which was nice. I figured it was a fluke and rescheduled my first delivery for 2/2. Two days prior to my delivery date, I got an email that my order had shipped. However, mid- day on Feb 2nd, they emailed me saying that my order could not be delivered due to an \"unexpected delay\". After two undelivered boxes, I cancelled my membership. I was willing to give them a pass the first time, but it's clear they are not reliable and have a lot of logistical work to do.",

I go out at 6:30 to get the package, and its nowhere to be found. I was hoping a neighbor may have received it by accident, however they did not. Customer service immediately credited my account, and they were very prompt. However, this review is based on purchasing, yet unable try the food. I have skipped next week's delivery as I will be out of town. So it will be two weeks until I can finally try the food, and hopefully update the review.",

    "text": "I've tried my share of food delivery services, so when Freshly had a promotion on Facebook I decided to give them a try. Someone below compared this to food served on an airplane, and I think that's accurate if a bit forgiving. Oily, poorly flavored, overcooked. You'd be doing yourself a favor by purchasing canned or frozen foods from a more reputable source. Competitors at the same price range in my area are of such a better quality that it would be silly to compare. That there are reviews claiming their food is 'delicious' seems highly suspect to me, but I suppose taste is subjective.   Further, you will be given precisely one day to cancel your subscription after delivery. Freshly will not offer you a confirmation code to keep for your records. When I was concerned that something was amiss with my cancelation (they sent an email asking if I wanted to adjust my meals), I was told there was no record I had stopped the service and that I should be pleased that they could cancel the next. That was five days before the delivery date. For the first time ever, I had to contact my bank to intercede on my behalf.   TLDR: I would not recommend the food or the customer service.",

I had 2 friends in different states who both \"just lost their husbands.\"  In deciding what I could do to help them while they were so down, knowing they won't feel like cooking just for themselves;  I decided to send each of them meals from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FFreshky.com&s=b9a13e8b4b0578d724c28042230d8e28c0372e8b79efc3b7bb9c7bf4cfffa662\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Freshky.com</a> for a few weeks.  First and foremost both of these friends raved about the \"quality and freshness of the meals received.\"  For me, setting up the two accounts and organizing different meal variety for each week for both friends was \"very easy to do\" - just be careful because if you don't switch out the meals yourself for each week, the system will default to your latest order.  Anyway, it was easy to skip weeks, change up the meals, and cancel once I felt my friends had some time to adjust a little better from their losses.   Prices are reasonable, with high quality fresh ready made meals delivered to their doors, this was a good choice and I am thankful for their services.",

I was a little nervous of the idea of shipping a box of cooked meals overnight. when I received the food, it felt somewhat like a cold room temperature. I had the chicken risotto first. after I finished the meal, I did start to have a slight allergic reaction (sometimes food that's processed with soy and corn trigger a skin allergy where I get itchy). that happened with my meal last night. however, the worst part was this morning - I literally had pretty terrible diarrhea right when I got to work at 8:30...and I'm 99% sure it was attributed to the freshly meal I had. maybe it was an allergic reaction to the food, or maybe it was a cooked meal being shipped overnight in less than ideal conditions, but whatever it was, I'm not taking the risk to have another. the good thing is that freshly is refunding me the cost of the meals, but it is rather disappointing since I was hoping this could be a good meal service to use.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love Freshly and gave it a good three month run but am pretty sure I'll be cancelling in the next few weeks. It still would serve a purpose for some people, so I'll layout some PROS and CONS.  PROS:  - Very convenient and truly solves the after work dinner insanity problem, particularly for families with young kids. 3ish minutes in the microwave and you're done. We started subscribing after my husband and I went back to work after maternity and paternity leave with our second kid. It was incredibly helpful during the first couple months with a new baby and struggling to adjust with going back to work full time. For scenarios like this, I would for sure recommend Freshly as a temporary solution to get your through a hectic time period.  - Again, so much easier than any of the subscription 'make it yourself' meal box services like Hello Fresh, Plated, Blue Apron, etc. - Better taste wise than many frozen meals.  - Reasonable calories for a meal, would be great if you were trying to lose weight.  - Our toddler actually ate many of the meals without much fuss. (He and I would split a meal and my husband would eat a full meal, portions are good.) - Only had one issue with delivery (wrong meal arrived) and customer service promptly gave us a credit on the next shipment.  CONS: - Small selection of meals and it seems like many meals we like aren't available all the time.  - In an average sample of 5 meal options, I'd say 2 were great, 2 were just OK and 1 we would throw out because it would be plain old gross. That's a decent ratio but at the end of the day we were snacking heavily after the mediocre meals and having to find a replacement (hello boxed mac and cheese) for the really gross meals we paid $10 each for, I just don't see the long term value in the service. They let you rate meals online and I've never once got a customer service response after giving meals 1 star. Would be nice if they acknowledged duds and gave you some credits for future meals.  - Delivery is only available on Saturday, and meals go bad on Wednesday. Since we wanted these to solve our dinner after work problem, that meant no flexibility for Mon-Wed meals, and we still had to cook or find other options for Thursday and Friday. Sunday or Monday delivery would be much preferred.   - It sort of assumes everyone is gluten free. I like gluten. Gimme that gluten. Please let me have some real pasta instead of rice pasta. :)",

    "text": "So, we ordered freshly early December because we had a baby in late November. What they didn't tell us was that two weeks into our subscription they decided to go on a two week holiday! No email, no communication.. they just updated our food plan and basically said, freshly will be closed due to the holiday so your next shipment will be Jan 8th... ok, well we still have to eat and we had no warning and no heads up as to that happening when we signed up or we would have used a different delivery service which is exactly why I'm sure they didn't tell anyone! So January comes and I'm trying to pick new meals and I notice there are no new meals. On their website it states they update their meals weekly so you get a few new choices. I chatted with the company and they told me that for the next month or so there would be no new choices because they were opening a second kitchen and it was a lot of work for them. I just like!!! But the reason we signed up is to have an array of fresh meals and you guaranteed that we would get new options weekly as stated on your website. She responded with, well we don't actually guarantee that!!! I'm so confused by the lack of communication with this company and frankly how disrespectful it is to take peoples money and promise something and not deliver. My mother in law got a notice that they just started to charge her account and send her food WITHOUT her permission and she had an account over a year ago. She hasn't even logged in in a year! They refunded her but what the hec?? They ended up giving us a one time discount and we paid for one more week after that and decided to cancel. Freshly, if you want people to use your service, COMMUNICATE and be honest.",

I still don't have the food and will likely be disputing the full charge with my credit card.  Certainly canceling this service.  There are too many reliable meal delivery services out there for a company to be so nonchalant about a delivery failure.",

I don't have the energy to cook at all. When I first started back to work I would just stop and get fast food or something quick like junky snacks to keep me going throughout the day but that was not helping get the baby weight off!! Now I can just pop one of these into the microwave and I am good to go.They're packaged nicely and are easy to take to work for lunch too.  I have only tried the entrees and not the breakfast but so far I've really liked the majority of what I've tried. The steak peppercorn is my favorite.  Some of the meals are higher in fat but it's not excessive and if you track correctly you can lose weight with these. I've had at least 1 meal a day and while using myfitnesspal I've been within my calorie/fat/sodium/protein goals A lot of the meals are lower in sugar and are gluten free too.   Overall, the meals I've had feel hearty and healthy and I am very happy! I am now doing 12 meals a week for $108/week or $9/meal. For what you get I think it's great, especially being in the bay area. I can't go out and get a meal like this for that price. The only reason for 4 stars is because the plastic film on the tray is hard to peel off and I think there could be some more food options to choose from each week.",

Unfortunately I'd come to rely on it too quickly, because the day the third order was supposed to arrive, I received notification that it was canceled. They automatically refunded my money and provided a $30 discount, but since they didn't offer to ship a replacement sooner to cover at least part of the week, I've canceled. Now I have to make other plans. Not that this all happened after I had already received a shipment confirmation notification. Clearly it was an automated mass email with no basis in fact.

    "text": "I was looking for portion controlled meals with healthier options that were conveniently delivered to me and I didn't have to spend time cooking. My husband works nights most days of the week and I don't feel like cooking for one and since these are microwavable he can take them to work for himself also. Everything I tried tasted OK, but that's it just OK. I've enjoyed store bought frozen meals just as much if not better, although I do admit that Freshly's quality of food overall is better in comparison. I wasn't very impressed with the selection and expected to have different options available to me every week or at least every other week, but it's a lot of the same thing. I tried it for a month since I was able to use a discount for the first 4 weeks, but after the 5th week I cancelled. For the price it just really wasn't worth it. I've switched to getting prepared meals at my local grocery store that I enjoy better and for a fraction of the cost. I never had issues with deliveries, everything came as expected each week and was what I ordered. One thing that always kind of bothered me was that they seemed to really advertise about being 'earth friendly' and that you can recycle most of the packaging, but it's kind of pain. You have to thaw the freezer inserts and then cut them open to discard what's inside and then just the plastic itself was recyclable; same with the foam packaging, you have to cut it open and discard what's inside and then just recycle the plastic covering and then of course the box is recyclable. I'll admit by the 3rd delivery I was just throwing away everything inside and just recycling the box. Overall, I'd say if you truly hate to cook or just don't have the time and don't mind spending the money, this may be the food service for you.",

They were using some service called lift serve. We called Freshly after hours and were told it wasnt going to be delivered. However their delivery service assured us it was . It never came. We stayed home a whole day for nothing. Its now Monday and I don't see any reason to believe its coming today, either.  It might be wonderful food, but its useless if you don't actually get it! Ohh my imagination runs wild at how scrumptious it must have been. The mail carrier must have gorged themselves! My girlfriend is one of those that lets things go. I'm not, I believe people should see REAL REVIEWS, and not just the ones from owners and employees of a business. You know whose never failed to deliver my meals when I order them? Any of the 5000 resteraints I've at. Good or bad, at least I ACTUALLY GOT THE FOOD! And when it was bad, a simple word with the manager usually fixed thibgs instead of blaming it on the shlub who delivered it.",

I'm a busy person and work out daily, so it's important to me to eat clean and just know what i'm eating so i'm not thinking about it. Freshly is totally reliable. My delivery was late once and they refunded me, but other than at, my meals are always cold and packaged well... just wish all the packaging wasn't so wasteful.  Every meal does seem fresh though and clean ingredients.. I don't eat junk food, so Freshly hits the mark. I don't recommend their breakfast. The omelets are small and don't hold up well in the fridge and i just don't like the flavor and ingredients of them. They should had a side to the breakfasts to make it feel comparable to the dinners.  The food isn't over salty or seasoned, so I add salt to mine and usually steamed kale to make it feel a bit bigger. The chicken is sometimes really lean and sometimes very fatty... it used to always be great, but not sure if they changed their meat vendor. The gluten free pastas are the best and the pork quality is top notch.  I wish they'd stop discontinuing my favorite stuff like the Spagehtti Squash Meatballs.  Also they have promos for $39 all the time, so they should just make your meals $39 and no promos. I cancel my subscription all the time until i get a new promo because $39 is the price point for me.  I really like Freshly, you won't be disappointed!",

I've had 12 different meals so far and they have been surprisingly good, although some are better than others. Pretty fortunate I haven't had any stomach issues, but I also make sure there isn't anything I'm allergic to in my orders. I've also had my share of Hungry-Man's and Lean Cuisines and Freshly is a definitely better than that for those people comparing it to TV dinners (it doesn't even come frozen, so how is it a TV dinner).",

They are lacking that extra touch of seasoning which would make them special. The pasta meals are ok if you add your own spices but the portions are tiny. The chicken is always very tender but tasteless. I liked the macaroni and cheese once I added salt. The chicken that came with it was so bland I couldn't eat it. I will stick to meal prepping and cooking my own fresh food from scratch. If you need easy microwave meals then get some frozen meals at the grocery store like Stouffer's. At least those have flavor and are much cheaper. My recommendations are to create meals with spices and flavor and have larger portions.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like Freshly for a number of reason but my primary reason for trying Freshly was for my 88yr old mother whom we have been trying to get out of the kitchen due to safety risks.  I thought if I could find her quality, nutritious prepared dishes she can just warm-up, she could spend more time playing Bingo rather than banging pots-n-pans together to put a meal together.   My mother is 88 and eats fairly healthy and has no health issues or diet restrictions at all so after doing my research on these Prepared meal providers, I settled for Freshly because they were one of the few if not only that offer already prepared dishes unlike some of them that send you all the ingredients and you put it together, that would defeat the purpose of what my intentions were.   Freshly delivered on everything they offer and we never had any problem with their service, food quality or anything.  This is week 4 that we have had deliveries of meals under the 6 meals a week subscription which I have been ordering her 2 breakfast and 4 dinner meals.  When the meals arrive, I go over and unpack them for her because the deliver box is too heavy for her to lift. I turn each one over and arrange them by the \"Best when used by date\" with the most recent on top and the older ones at the bottom.   The trend that I have noticed has been that 4 out of the 6 meals have a best when used by date on the same day and the other 2 soon after or before.  This is an issue because my 88yr old mother doesn't eat that much and has been eating half at lunch and half at dinner because she cannot consume the entire portion in one sitting.   All-in-all, I don't recommend this service for seniors because of 2 reasons.  The best before dates are too close together (4 on the same day is a lot) and the portions are too big for most seniors her age.  Outside of what my personal experience has been, Freshly does a great job, they just don't work for my situation so I am going to cancel my subscription and look for something more local who can better meet our needs.",

It's packed in a really nice, insulated box with recyclable insulation that can survive a couple hours on the porch in Phoenix heat. The price per meal is super affordable. Cool beans.  BUT the food just doesn't taste that good  The meals are loaded with sodium, and, somehow, they still taste like nothing. Certain dishes are better than others (we found that the chicken dishes were the best meat dishes; all of the steak meals came out like rubber), but overall I just can't live my life eating this stuff.

Tried the pork sausage with pasta and peppers. It looked impressive but was very bland and the sausage dry. Like I've never had such a dry sausage.  The pasta was gluten free, all the meals are, and these were made of red lentils I believe. Tasted like mush, didn't eat more than a couple. Red, green and yellow bell peppers were the best part. Had sun dried tomatoes and I didn't know that until I ate some. Don't like sun dried tomatoes at all, disappointed I didn't know they were in there. Clearly on the inredient list but I missed it.  Tuscan chicken soup was hearty, bland and bland. Not sure why there was no flavor but I was disappointed. Plus there are over 700 calories so this was a downer. Still have 4 more meals to try, not hopeful about the taste.  Forgot to take pictures of the soup. Whoops. Food arrived as expected with a tracking number. Dry ice and a few ice packs made the food pretty frozen. Not just a light frost but solidish. At least it wasn't spoiled but the website says it's not made to be frozen.",

Taste amazing, surprisingly filling  I'm not interested in cooking so it actually saves me money and time not going going out to eat or ordering delivery.  No cooking, dishes or messes to clean up.  They have great meal options for those counting calories and macros and it's all made with good fresh ingredients.  Their variety is excellent and I'm yet to eat one of their meals that I disliked.",

    "text": "I have ordered Freshly for about 3 weeks now and I have to say that I am extremely satisfied. In the past I have tried both Nutrisystem and BistroMD and they aren't nearly as good as Freshly in terms of the quality of food. I purchase the 12 meal delivery for all of my lunches and dinners so I can't give you any input on the breakfast meals but I can say that all of the lunches and dinners are pretty darn good. I figure there is no point to buying breakfasts because they are just too easy to prepare on my own.  I have seen some reviewers talk about how they had some pieces of fat in their meat and I have experienced that as well, but it isn't the case will all of the meat dishes all of the time. This sort of thing is bound to happen but there is still plenty of food to eat. Also I saw some mention of the meals having too much pepper. There is a dish of Pepper steak where they use whole peppers in the sauce which I happen to really like.  The greatest part of Freshly (at least for me) is that I don't have to cook, or shop for food and clean up the kitchen, and deal with tupperware containers. When I am sitting down eating a Freshly meal I think to myself how much time and effort it would take me to make a similar meal and it's so worth it! It's worth it to spend approx 10 dollars a meal and have more time to live my life.  Tip: If your ordering the 12 meal program (6 days lunch/Dinner) and you want to make your meals last 7 days a week. Skip one day (make it a cheat day) and every time your order comes in you will have an extra day.  I highly recommend Freshly!",

I weight lift 4 times a week and was hoping Freshly could provide clean post-workout meals to make sure I meet my protein and calorie needs. I was disappointed.  Freshly covers their meat and vegetables in extremely thick sauces and marinades. Everything tastes \"heavy\" and thick. Which is sad because the chicken is of high quality and would be great without the sauce. I actually rinsed it in the sink and ate it plain :/ As someone who generally only eats fresh store-bought produce/meats with minimal sauces and ingredients, almost all of the Freshly meals tasted unhealthy.   It reminds me of Fresh and Easy.... which I used to love but after eating extremely clean for the last 2 years, now tastes like nothing but sodium and sugar to me. In all honesty, Freshly meals would probably taste \"healthy\" to most modern Americans  The steak had potential but had an unacceptable amount of fat for over a $10 a meal. Ended up giving 1/3 of it to my dog.",

It is now August 1st, and it has not been received.  if this was candy, shoes, or even a book, I would not be worried.  But it is perishable food.  YUK!  No ice packs are going to keep this cold for that long.   Also, when I go in and look at my order, there are several items that were changed.  I did not order salmon.  I cannot eat salmon.  Again, I did not order Salmon.  There is a salmon dish on my order.   Called CS and was told that someone had changed my subscription to a \"free\" 1 weeks delivery, so yay for me.  Well, my card was charged, so there was nothing free about it.   Was also told that it was the delivery people's problem that it was late.  May be, but I never even received an email from Freshly saying that it had shipped, and providing me with a tracking number.   Only offer was to change the date to 2 weeks from now (this was food we were going to use on our vacation) or to refund my money.  I asked for a refund.  I will let y'all know if I receive it.   I am afraid now I am going to get home from vacation with a box of spoiled food on my front porch that has been opened and enjoyed by raccoons.   There is also no way to cancel your subscription once they have you.  You can only pause it, or skip weeks.  I would really like to cancel and have proof that they no longer have my credit card number.",

This is unacceptable customer service!! I am completely done with freshly and I hate the fact of how I've been treated!!

    "text": "TERRIBLE FOOD and HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE... Unethical company.. I ordered 6 items on a trial subscription. They got the order wrong and 3 of the 6 fish dishes were inedible. Fish smelled so bad we ended up throwing them away. The other 3 were bland and like any frozen food you can get at a supermarket, at 4x the cost.  Within 24 hours of receiving the first shipment, before I even had a chance to taste the food, I was charged $62 for the second shipment. They were also supposed to send an email notifying me of upcoming charges but I never received it. Immediately went online to cancel my subscription and contacted the company.   Told the rep how bad the food was, not receiving an email notification of the charge, and that I do not want to continue the service. The rep rudely said \"you do realize we are a subscription based company\" and that they will not refund the 2nd shipment because I 'should've' received an email. I asked to speak to a manager to which she said \"fine, but the manager is not going to refund your money either.\" After a 10 minute hold for the manager, she came back and said they're having internet problems so she is not able to transfer the call. Could this be why I never received the email from them??? If the manager ever calls back and doesn't correct the situation, I will be disputing the charge with my cc company.   ======== Update:  1 1/2 day later - received a call from a supervisor. She actually stated that she also did not receive email notification of charges from the company when she first signed up for subscription... but that the problem had been resolved... obviously not. Bottom line, she refused any refund. Spoke to Toby, cust svc manager who was rude and arrogant. He also said he is not going to do anything about the problem... he's not going to issue a refund and that's that.... and that there's no one above him that I would be able to speak to. Let's see how long this company stays in business.   Will be contacting the state consumer protection and BBB. May contact the health department because obviously they're not handling fish properly.",

Chicken parm- Not bad but, not great same as stouffers TV dinner  Slow pulled pork- I never got to try, my girlfriend tried and wouldn't offer it to the dog. #dumpsterfood  Farmhouse chicken- once you microwave a breaded food, there is no crispy, why bread it? Tried to crisp it in the oven resulted in #dumpsterfood  Chicken teriyaki....or teri-yucky.... I gagged and my girlfriend laughed because she already tasted it while I spat it on the plate.  I'm sorry Freshly, you are trying, everyone may want to try it once as I'm not a food snob but I wish you luck, it may be for you, but not for us.

Apparently, there are two different places to change your address on the website. That seems like a pretty poor user experience. How would I know I need to change it in two different places?

Just as another reviewer described, one of my orders was also delivered late and I received an email not to eat it and to discard the meals. I do understand that things like that can happen and didn't make a big deal out of it at all.  However, the main beef I have with them is that out of four orders, two were incorrect and were missing some meals but contained others twice instead. I double-checked my orders placed on my account to make sure it wasn't my own mistake, but what I ordered definitely did not match what I received. While speaking to their customer service, the issue was basically ignored and I was advised they won't do anything 7 days after the order. So apparently if you don't call and complain right away, you're SOL and they won't stand behind their products. This service seemed like a convenient idea at first but with these types of disappointments after just a few orders and at over $10 a meal, it's really not worth it. There are too many other meal service options out there to put up with this kind of BS. Cheers to a customer lost and this well-deserved word of mouth \"advertising,\" Freshly.",

    "text": "Used Freshly for a couple months It's fine... really - it's ok. It might even be good - except for the price.   The meals arrived on time and because the meal is self contained there's no missed or damaged ingredient like you regularly get with meal kits (tried them all and they all have this problem to varying degrees). Obviously the prep is just wonderful - a few minutes in the microwave and you're ready to go. The food, for the most part, has been delicious. One meal that was almost inedible but otherwise everyone in the house has enjoyed them.  Downside 1: $10+ per \"meal\". Often these meals are under 500 calories, so as far as dinner is concerned, this is almost half a meal. I suppose they're fine for a light lunch, but you could have spent that $10 at Panera Bread for something heartier and much more fresh - or heck, prepared/frozen food from Trader Joe's or even Whole Foods will be cheaper and more substantive. For $30 for 3 people I can just order delivery if I'm too pressed to cook.   Downside 2: Limited menu rotation; especially for specific diets. Over the course of 6 weeks I saw NO changes to the vegetarian options. Basically the same 3 dishes every single week, week after week after week. Gobble, Home Chef, and others ensure 3+ new vegetarian options every week (sometimes 4 or 5 new options in a week).   Hopefully someday they'll switch from the wasteful plastic trays to cheaper, more efficient vacuum sealing. They could fit 3x more food in each package and make the meal cost more reasonable.",

When I ordered Freshly I was worried I was paying for overpriced Hungry Man frozen dinners. I was wrong. The food not only looks good and is packaged well, but it tastes great and is actually nutritious. My package arrived right on time and I could tell as soon as I opened the package I had a quality product. My food was wrapped tightly in recyclable cold packs and cushion. Each meal has a detailed nutrition lable and ingredients list. With the first bite I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. You can tell it's made by hand and isn't the frozen garbage I was expecting. At about $10 a meal, I can honestly say I believe it to be worth it, and I will definitely extend my subscription.",

Ordered in December for meals to start being delivered in January. On the day I was expecting my delivery, I noticed that on my online account, it said no delivery was scheduled but I got no email in advance. Me: Huh? Spoke to someone via live chat and they said that due to high demand, they couldn't keep up and they had to cancel my order and would refund me. Immediately asked them to cancel my subscription because I'm not only paying for food, but also dependability and if you can't promise that when someone orders well in advance, what's the point of your business?",

After not receiving my meals the first time, I ordered again giving the company the benefit of the doubt. Again, the same thing happened. I received an e-mail that the delivery had a \"shipping label created via FedEx.\" However, there was never any activity beyond that. The next e-mail I received was that there was a delay and that my delivery would be refunded. They do offer a discount every time that they miss meals, but again, not worth it since you never actually receive the meals. I spoke with a customer service representative to ensure that I was getting refunded and to cancel my subscription. I asked the status of the order and she stated, \"The package is out for delivery for the time frame of 8am-9pm but that time frame cannot be determined due to the driver's route etc.\" I had to let her know (since clearly this was not the case) that there was no shipping activity what-so-ever. She stated that perhaps the driver hasn't had a chance to scan it in yet. Considering the delivery would be coming from Ohio to Minnesota and it's FED-EX, there is always shipping activity if it's actually en route.  I've never experienced errors like this with Fed-Ex, ever. Like other reviews, the blame completely went on Fed-Ex which I don't think is the case. The idea of the service is great if the company could actually correct it's errors and produce the product. Obviously from reviews, this is a major issue that needs to be fixed. It just seems like there's an over abundance of orders and under production because the company hasn't figured out yet how to handle a high volume of orders, etc.   I do not recommend this service which is sad because I was excited to give this a try and make it a weekly thing.",

Now on to the actual review: After a week of trying out the meals, I can actually say that I like all of them and I'll be continuing business with them. The meals comes in a prepacked box together with some gel used to keep it chilled. Every meal that I tried so far is great in taste. My friends had a blast in trying some of them out (not that I would willingly share it then now). The best thing is that it does satisfy my cravings. I don't feel that I'm hungry for more after I eat but I'm also trying to be conscious on what I eat. Nonetheless, the meals taste great, and it's low in calorie.   Like I said, I'll continue doing business with them.",

    "text": "So I just signed up for my first delivery, but haven't received my package and can't comment on the quality.  However, I'm cancelling the service because of selection, delivery and customer service issues.    1.  When I signed up, I selected some meals just to see how the process worked.  However, once I completed the sign up, I wasn't permitted to change the meals and had to go through their customer service folks who did indeed help, but forcing me to do that was ridiculous.  Supposedly, that only happens on the first delivery setup, but it's just dumb that it happens at all.  2.  More importantly, as soon as I signed up and tried to set up future weeks, I saw a message saying that my next delivery can't be completed because it falls on a holiday (4th of July).  I contacted the company (twice, because they ignored my first email), assuming that there must be a way to work around the problem.  Nope.  Their excuse is that their office is closed on the 4th and 5th and delivery slots for the 3rd are already \"full\".  So basically, every time there's a holiday, there's a chance that you won't get any meals that week.  Terrible processes.  Terrible customer service.  ***  Received a follow up email from their customer service folks saying that because my delivery day is a Thursday and most holidays fall on Mondays, I shouldn't have a problem in the future.  Really?  So what if I had chosen Mondays as my delivery day?  And why didn't they offer an alternative delivery day for that week rather than telling me I'm just out of luck?  Freshly is not ready for prime time.  This is Customer Service 101-type stuff.  Think twice.",

I have only tried 2 of the meals: Chicken Teriyaki and Pulled Pork with Kale Salad and Carrots. The Chicken Teriyaki rice and veggies were bland (the chicken was OK). I needed to add soy sauce. The pulled pork was tastier but I noticed that both meals left a strange unpleasant aftertaste in my mouth that I just cannot get past. I needed to brush my teeth right away.   I have 4 meals remaining but really do not want to experience that aftertaste again so I'm thinking I'll just throw them out - which is hard for me to do because I hate being wasteful.

Also, I keep hearing about portion sizes being too small...this is the portion size we should be eating, especially if you want to lose weight. I snack a lot less with these meals, and I am losing weight. The main thing I love about Freshly, is they are now a certified gluten free facility! This is so nice and convenient for those of us with Celiac disease! I can just grab their meals and go! People with gluten issues or Celiac can't just grab food without knowing what's in it. I feel special with Freshly because I don't think there are any other meal services that are certified gluten free. With the other companies, I would have to go through all their meals and figure out if they're safe for me to eat. Not with Freshly! Their meals are ALL gluten free and taste home-cooked in my opinion. If the food is too bland for you: add some spices! I am now ordering 12 meals a week for $8.99/meal. McDonald's meals are around the same price, if not more and they are not healthy at all. I can't go there anyway...just comparing the cost.  I am happy with Freshly, overall they are saving me time and money!",

It takes 15 seconds to season to my liking and doesn't really add any significant time or cost to my meal. Food arrives well packed and very cold.  My only gripe is that I wish they used coconut oil instead of canola.

You have enough choices for a new subscriber but now that I've been getting meals for past 4 weeks I need new choices. I don't mind repeats after 3-4 weeks but I read before starting subscription that you add meals weekly and that isn't the case. Including my next delivery coming on 2/18/19 you have only added 1 new meal since I started and that's over 6 weeks of delivery's. You finally have a 2nd new meal added for the last week of February so that will make it 2 new meals over 7 weeks of food. You need to step this up big time you you have any plan on keeping people more than a few weeks. I also see you dropped breakfast items which i'm bummed about and wish they could come back. Just would need something more than skimpy omelet for $10 though if you do. Hope to see more choices faster ( like 2 per week) so i can stay a happy full customer.",

Freshly has been a game changer for me - allowing me to eat a variety of different dishes in a quick and easy way. I usually dress up the meals with plating, side salads and additional spices but this is a breeze compared to the chopping, baking, frying and mashing needed with other meal kits.  This is a dream for busy singles that want a nice meal, certainly not home cooking, but a light year beyond TV dinners in freshness, taste and nutritional value.  Steak Peppercorn seems to be the most consistent winner but I also like the many chicken and meat-based pasta options. My only concern is that the shipping does have hiccups now and again but so far that has been rare and Freshly provided credits, which are appreciated.  The app is also well done and provides accurate tracking of the meals so I am able to collect them quickly and securely.  I also like how the app is quick, easy to navigate and it is easy to skip weeks or look ahead in time to plan meals.",

    "text": "My coworker was raving about Freshly and sent me a promo code, so I decided to give it a try. For background, I have a hectic job, live within walking distance to way too many restaurants, and thus eat out a lot. So that's my best, realistic alternative to Freshly: eating at a restaurant.   If you compare Freshly to restaurant food, it's great--much less calorically dense, higher fiber, fewer suspect ingredients. You'll also be hard-pressed to beat $10/meal outside of fast food. So that's good.   However, if you compare Freshly to a homecooked meal... well, of course it's going to fall short. Nothing is as good as a steak right off the grill or perfectly al dente pasta coated in a luscious sauce and sprinkled with fresh herbs. You have to be realistic. Most meals have one really good part and one mediocre part (fantastic side but ho-hum main, or marvelous main and middling side).   So how do I rate Freshly overall? It's extremely convenient. It's healthier than eating out. I wish they had more low-carb options (because really, if you watch carbs, under 35 grams of carbs per meal isn't actually that low--it's actually... kind of high). I wish the portions were slightly smaller and that the ice packs weren't so wasteful (let the ice packs thaw and dump them in a fresh plastic trash bag so that I can recycle the original plastic bag? Really?) Overall, I'll probably keep ordering for the convenience factor, but I don't know that I'm an acolyte.",

    "text": "I had been eyeballing Freshly for quite a while when I decided to show the service to my boyfriend. We looked it over together and we both decided to sign up and try it out. We figured worst case scenario is the food is hideous, cancel, and move on with life. BEST case scenario would be that we love it, and say goodbye to constantly trying to figure out what to do for dinner, shop, spend the $40 on ONE night's meal, cook, clean, etc.   Good news people, it was best case scenario. I got delivery scheduled for Friday and had it delivered to my work rather than let it sit outside my apartment. It came in about an 18 pound box, really nicely packaged and with ice packets in the box keeping everything cold.   I did not actually try one of my meals until Monday. I ordered (2) steak peppercorns (I love steak), chicken pilaf, beef chili, southwest chicken bowl, and the chicken pilaf. I have to say I was genuinely impressed with all the meals with exception of the chili. There wasn't really anything wrong with it, just wasn't my cup of tea. The other meals, however, were great! I was impressed with the quality of the proteins, sauces, and fresh sides. I would also like to comment on the portion sizes. I have not been able to finish one full meal, they completely fill me up!  I have to say I feel great about this decision. I no longer have to come up with dinner or lunch ideas, I am provided with healthy and very filling options, and it keeps me from eating a bunch of fast food options out of convenience needs.",

I think most people don't review unless they are unhappy for whatever reason, so more need to get on board with supporting a business they love. Fantastic food and great customer service! We've had several dinners and not one complaint! I was actually amazed at the amount of flavors they have all had! I was hooked after the cod cakes, I couldn't believe how much flavor was packed into the entire dinner! My husband is a huge flavor guy and even he was shocked at the flavors in these meals! Love love love your company!!! I wish I could do a 10 star to help with the silly reviews from others.",

After a few times eating the same meals, you just get kind of tired of it and at over $10/meal, you just would rather go eat at a fast food joint. Here are the meals I tried and my scores:  Grilled Flat Iron Steak: 4- tender and juicy, steak is somewhat slim but it was enough for me.   Baked Penne Marinara: 3 - a little bland, but a generous portion.   Chimichurri Salmon: 2.5 - to me, there's something wrong with eating a precooked salmon and microwaving it later. It's dry and doesn't taste fresh.   Grilled herb chicken: 1 - I do not recommend. It was bland, boring and I threw most of it away.   Garlic & Herb Shrimp: 2 - the shrimp is really small and the flavor wasn't that great. It looks better than it tastes.  Peruvian style stuffed peppers: 2 - I wasn't a big fan of this one either. I didn't like the taste and I only ate half of one pepper. The package comes with 2.   Sweet & Spicy chicken: 3 - the flavor wasn't bad but the chicken was small!   Overall, convenient but pricey. I cancelled my weekly delivery and don't plan to sign up again. I'd rather eat out or make my own paleo/gluten free meals.",

So far we have our two go to meals and try different meals for the third one. We get a total of 6 and I double the dish for myself and my husband. They have all been fail other than our two go to meals  So I was really looking forward to the newly added meals. With only having two options that we really like, it makes it hard to stick with the service. I am a first time mom and work 9hrs a day. So that's 12 hrs I spend away from my little one. I was hoping to not be able to cook as much so that I can enjoy my son after work. Instead I have to search on Pinterest for quick meals that taste better than the other was provided by freshly. I'm not sure how much longer I will be staying with them. I've been with them now for three months. I maybe leaving them in 2018. Since grocery stores not deliver as well. Just will have to start meal prepping and cooking quick meals sigh.",

Their Facebook page posts promo codes, which I recently used.  Every time I do it I confirm the price and the delivery date before I submit my order.  They did not honor it when I got my credit card statement.  I'm very skeptical since you can't review past orders online receipts.  The customer service rep I dealt with online would not credit my money.  I kept sending screenshots on how the flaw was with the promo code and they kept coming back with excuses.  I sent 3 screen shots confirming all the error on their end.  They would rather keep the $35 and lose me as an unhappy customer than continuing.  Honestly had they resolved it I would have continued making orders. Michael Wystrach, if you're ready this please enjoy the $35 you got to pull over me!",

I have very high standards for everything in my life and when I ordered these meals it was more for the convenience as I did not think they would really measure up to what I am used to eating in terms of taste and quality. But I must say I was wrong in that regard. Not only did it exceed my expectations as far as convenience, simplicity, and service, but the food is exceptional to taste. Every meal is amazingly prepared and tastes great. With my busy schedule, this is the company I have been waiting for!  Bravo!",

When I got a email saying that my NEXT delivery was a WEEK later (with the exact same food that I didn't like the week prior) I informed them that I was out if town for work and they wouldn't budge.  They wouldn't postpone, cancel or even change the horrible selections to something even more horrible.  Now I will have 6 glorified TV dinners rotting in my front door while I'm away.  I wanted to cancel the order but they gave me some story about it being sent to production.  How can it be fresh it you cook 3 days prior to shipping me?

Second, it tastes no better than a standard frozen dinner.   Yes, the ingredients may be healthier, but look at the next point.   I ordered SIX meals.   They came in a huge 2' x 2' x 2' box filled with cold packs and an enormous amount of insulation.   The packaging alone is about 15 pounds.  AND THAT WAS ONLY FOR 6 MEALS!!!   Think of all the waste that would be generated if everyone used this service.  Are people really that lazy that they need to have sub-par food delivered to their door in packaging that would overfill their curbside garbage can?   Ridiculous.   I'm appalled by this company.  I hope there are people who are more concerned about limiting landfill overcrowding than they are about a small bit of \"convenience.\"",

The food is marketed as being healthy fresh eating. There is nothing healthy about it. some of the items have over 700 calories. The food sounds like it should be delicious but everything has MASSIVE amounts of pepper on it. I don't know if it's because the food is lacking flavor or something and they decided that massive amounts of pepper was a good idea, but there is WAY to much pepper on every dish i had. i could go into the details of how some of the dishes resemble baby food, but will leave it with this....if you want to eat the same type of food. buy a 99 cent frozen meal, pour a bunch of pepper on it and boom...pretty much the same thing.",

I was absolutely shocked when I tasted two of their recents offerings. The penne pasta was mediocre at best. The BBQ like chicken with broccoli and potatoes I literally spit out!!! It was absolutely vile! Flavorless, soggy, worse than any third rate TV dinner ever tried. I was so taken a back I requested a refund for my \"trial\" which they denied. Not surprising! This company won't last and will get many people \"trying\" for $39 and never have repeat customers again. I was so excited to have prepared food of quality that I could just heat up  and was just blown away that someone could put out such a poor product in this day and age. Please beware and don't waste your money! You will be sorely disappointed. I cancelled immediately and requested a refund because it was that bad. I almost never give negative reviews but felt so strongly that I wanted to protect others from going through this. This is truly a consumer rip off.",

And extremely False advertising for being \"healthy\". $70 for 6 one-serving meals, that have as much sodium, cholesterol, and saturated fat as eating out at a restaurant. My husband and I signed up for this after comparing costs to Blue Apron, Hello Fresh, etc. This one was the cheapest, even with having the meals already made. So we thought, why not? Meals were still cold when delivered to us, but looking at the nutritional facts compared to the freezer one-serving meals we have for those just-in-case days when we didn't have time to pack a lunch for work, they were worse!!! The Freshly meals were higher in every aspect of health of the frozen microwave dinners. Calories, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium....no where near being healthy. If you know even the basics of health, anything processed and made to be kept as edible for longer than 1 or 2 days on a shelf is going to have things added to it to make it that way, which ups the bad parts of nutritional content. I have no complaints on the taste of the meals, the meat didn't taste rubbery or fake, but it is an over-priced, glorified microwave meal.",

The presentation is great and the food tastes so wonderful and has a lot of variety.

Never had vegetables so delectable & perfect the flavor was phenomenal. I look forward to every meal. The portions are hefty & filling and my favorite EVERYTHING is blanket across the board GLUTEN FREE. This can't be beat. My life just became so much more manageable thanks to FRESHLY!!!!!

I recommend if you sign up, immediately pause or cancel since you won't have enough time to decide if you like the groceries.

I called the company and spoke to customer service to ask what happened and they read to me the incorrect zip code saying I input it wrong. I then found my confirmation email with the correct zip code I gave. I then asked if I could change my zip code and they said they don't deliver to that one.

I always felt like there was a real, friendly person there, even though we were communicating via email.  The food is very tasty and consistent, and you choose all your meals.

It is a super convenient option for those of us that work long hours, want better food options than McDonald's, but don't have the time or energy to cook at home.  Can I buy a $4 frozen meal at the store, well sure I can, but that is not what I want.  I want something fresher, healthier, and a better portion.  Freshly accomplishes that. Every meal is gluten free, high protein, low carb, and all natural.  If you want restaurant quality meals for $5, good luck to you.  For the convenience and price, these meals are quick and tasty.  Had the flat iron steak meal last night, personally I couldn't finish it all, and the steak was super tender, which surprised me considering we heat it up in the microwave.  I'm excited to try the other meals received.  My husband loved it too, and while he could probably eat more, we are looking to lose weight and have portion control.  I would say the ONLY thing I've noticed was that the meals have high sodium content, but that is expected with convenience meals.   For what this service provides-I love it.  I have not had any customer service issues, but will update if I ever do.",

I love that it's low-carb, high protein, and gluten-free. Every delivery I've gotten has been on time, packaged well and very fresh. There is a good variety of entrees to choose from as well as the option to get some entrees without cheese which is great for me bc I can't do dairy. The food is really healthy with whole, simple ingredients, no preservatives and nothing artificial. My only concern would be the salt content but I'm not parched like I am say, after a pizza or a burger so it can't be too bad. There is nutrition info available in case you wanna be sure of what ur eating. There are a few plans to choose from in terms of number of entrees delivered. You can also skip weeks and pause or cancel your subscription with ease.  They usually have deals or offers so definitely be on the look out for them in your email. I took away one star bc any way you look at it, it can be a lil pricey.",

A company should be able to move faster than that. I then loved the meal arrival - simple packaging. Gel cold packs are a bit bulky and wasteful, but the rest is streamlined. My first salmon meal was okay -- because you have to reheat it, the salmon gets overcooked. The peppers meal was also okay but made me question if I would like the rest. Next meal of pecan pork was awful - weird texture to the pork; definitely not high quality meat. Final meal of herb chicken was very good. After the pork I canceled my service. I couldn't tell if it canceled the next week's delivery but assumed it did since not message came up saying it didn't. But they sent another set of meals, saying I had to cancel by 5 pm on Thursday - the day after I received my first shipment on Weds afternoon. Ridiculous. They could have easily canceled my service (I canceled on Friday for meals that wouldn't even be packed or shipped before Monday). Don't use this company, especially if you have high expectations for good-tasting meals.",

I skipped the second week since we had only just received the food and then I was out of town camping the next weekend and got back just after the 5pm Sunday deadline. I was already charged for the next week and while I could still change the meals for another day, they refused to cancel the week's shipment because I missed the deadline by one hour. They claimed it was because the food was already purchased but then how is it I could still change meals? They even told me they sent two emails saying the deadline was Saturday when they really sent one saying it was Sunday. And you can't completely cancel your subscription, only pause it! It's the same system as loot crate or a food coop, except with either of those, if you miss the deadline, you're only out $50/month rather than $100/week. Plus, you get a lot more from those services than this one.",

    "text": "I got my first order on Tuesday this week (I decided to try it since they had a $50 off promotion).  I cancelled the subscription on Wednesday due to the following reasons (that I have already sent to them):  1. Every single meal has grapeseed oil and my son is allergic to grapeseed oil, so I have to make a separate meal for him anyway.  It's not necessary to use grapeseed oil for all meals, and others may be allergic as well.  There should be some choices that use safer oils like canola or vegetable oil. 2. The meals are packaged in a way that they look like frozen entrees/TV dinners.  That has turned me and my husband off even though it says it's fresh.  Different packaging would help. 3. So far, the meals are okay, nothing spectacular.  Some have a lot of flavor and others are very bland and definitely not worth the full $11 price. 4. Some containers have the plastic wrap so strongly glued to the box that I can't peel it off, I have to cut it with scissors or a knife.  This is fine, except it makes it difficult at work and when I'm in a hurry. 5. 2 minutes is not enough time to heat all of the products. When I heated chicken dishes such as Chicken Rustica or Chicken Livorno or even the Grilled Iron Steak, for 2 minutes, the meat was cold on the inside.  And I have a very powerful microwave.  All in all, I would love to try this again once the above issues have been resolved.  It's great for full-time working mothers, although on the expensive side.",

    "text": "I wanted to like it. I really really did. And I tried. I hate cooking and meal planning, and was desperate for this type of system- low cal, healthy food, already made, and delivered to my door. In the end though, I just couldn't keep lying to myself.  The other comments about the meals being no different from frozen tv dinners were unfortunately pretty True in my opinion. One big and important difference (for me anyway) is that the chicken seems to be real chicken and not that weird gross chicken composite substitute you find in Lean Cuisines and Smart Ones. That's pretty important, and why I gave an extra star.  Other than that though, yes the meal portions are small. This didn't immediately bother me because I'm intentionally trying to eat small portions. I was still pretty freaking hungry after eating though. I feel like they need to be supplemented with a salad and LOTS of water to make you feel satisfied.  Taste wise, I noticed the same things I notice with regular frozen meals from the grocery store. Sometimes there's a burnt plastic sort of taste. There's pretty much always a nasty aftertaste. And they way overuse the garlic, I think to compensate. No flavor? Throw on some garlic! For example, the Chicken Parmesan comes with steamed broccoli mixed with garlic chunks. And I do mean chunks. I feel like this meal could have been vastly improved by roasting the broccoli and using a seasoning, like Italian herbs. The Rustic Chicken tasted fine, but I swear the 'mashed potatoes' were scooped directly out of a Weight Watchers Smart Ones meal. They were identical and in no way reminded me of real mashed potatoes. The Butternut Squash Risotto tasted fine while eating but I brushed my teeth three times and still couldn't get rid of the chemical aftertaste. Added note: the meals are small, but forget about it if you're eating something without protein. You'll be more satisfied after eating a granola bar.   One last observation... I think some of the meals could be improved with better packaging. The meals come in one disposable plastic container and are microwaved all together. This often results in a soggy or mushy mess. Maybe separate the sauces? Allow the consumer to put the meal together? Just a thought.  Final verdict: these are most certainly not \"chef prepared\" meals and if they are, the \"chef\" needs to go back to school. I didn't find them to be any better than what I find in the frozen aisle at a quarter of the cost. If I hadn't employed a coupon on my order, I'd be much less forgiving, but I'm glad I got the curiosity out of the way. Save your money and do either one of the meal kits like Home Chef for real home cooked food, or hit up aisle 17 at your local PigglyWiggly.",

    "text": "I have been subscribing to Freshly for a couple of months. I have not tried any of the breakfast because I really don't like to spend dollars at breakfast every day and I'm very basic or over the top on breakfast. My big concern was lunch. I get a per diem every day for lunch. So it was very easy to go out everyday for an hour lunch break. Spend $10 or more plus tip or think your saving money on fast food. My concern was I noticed a huge Spike in my blood sugars because I test them 4 time a day.   I started with the 4 meals per week and it was delivered on time and packaged very professional. Also was included was a starters kit to let me know everything is recyclable and if your into saving our environment that's another topic. I enjoyed the reading material and still keep it around if I can get anyone else interested because you can earn free meals if you do. The meals were fine only a couple I keep in rotation for every other week. You don't want to eat the same meal over and over like every one does from time to time. And I have skipped a week Thanksgiving time. That's a big plus you can schedule when you want.  Deliveries  I prefer to have Wednesday but it you decide I think every one would love Monday but its because of logistics of course. Maybe some day it will happen. But for this I'm ok with being my delivery day. I also like Saturday delivery but during football season I was never home so. The reason I make this point if you look at when your meal arrive look for the  USE BY DATE. Very important because you want to make sure you eat that meal before that date. It's NOT like it will go BAD and I have eaten more than a few meals before the USE BY DATE. Why I make this point because you want to eat it for the best taste and fresh don't be lazy and pick a couple of days after like me. I think you have 5 maybe 4 days after the deliver date before the best by date kicks in. And you can freeze it if you have to. But what's the point in that???  Meals I like that they have changed from the standard 2 minutes and Done. Your packaging tells you if you want to microwave the in package or put your meal on a plate. And now that changes the old standard 2 minutes and done. Every meal is different on cook time and I'm fine with that. I'm a big fan of this it just goes to show you they are always changing or looking for better tasting meals. I always try the new menu choice when it changes only one was a disaster but hey I tried it. I would write it down but I think it will go into the vault soon as a failure recipe. My advice is to try everything in rotation once but as I say that there was couple I stayed away from and it's because it's something a little to unique for my taste buds.    FYI My blood sugars are back to normal after my standard 2 hours and check. And I think that is wonderful. Happy Eating",

If you go to the grocery store and buy a Stoffers individual meal it will run you around five bucks, for five bucks more you get a fresh complete meal delivered to your home! No driving to the store, no shopping, no cooking, no hassle.   Now about the food, I've pretty much tried most of the meals, and with the exception of one meal all of them have been truly fantastic. One time I received chicken risotto and it had a burnt taste. I contacted customer service and they immediately gave me credit towards a free meal.

    "text": "TLDR: an easy and relatively low-priced option for paleo/GF meal service with low calorie counts. I don't see myself being a regular customer, and I wasn't thrilled with the lack of contact with customer service, but flavors and portions are better than they appear.  Issue #1: my order arrived 24 hours late. Scheduled for 12/15, not received by 10PM, no email notifications and no way to track. I confirmed that they took money out of my account and that I had the delivery date correct. There's no way to contact anyone directly, but if there's a delay with your order, the FAQ page says to email their support department the following day (implying that this is fairly common?). Convenience of preordering is irrelevant if they can't keep to stated delivery time and I end up without lunch/dinner, waiting an extra day. So far no one from the company has acknowledged the delay or even reached out with a form letter or link for feedback.  Issue #2: Full disclosure: I ordered with their half off promo. I can't imagine anyone paying $10/meal for this. It's essentially TV dinners, one step removed from the Atkins line. The food doesn't look appetizing and it literally arrives frozen solid, further lending the comparisons to your grocery-store aisle food. Fresh =/= frozen. The cook times are not accurate- all of meals needed at least an additional minute, if not double the listed time just to get heated through. I'm aware that there can be cooking variations with microwave wattage and elevation, but this is ridiculous. Food is icy inside when following directions.  THE POSITIVES:They offer large menus of over 40 breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals each week, and I like that you can fully customize each meal instead of just in pairs like with other services. But the food is not exciting and service so nonexistent, it's not worth the price or arguable \"convenience\". Note that you have to join, order, and check a specific page, then download a PDF simply to view calorie counts or additional nutrition info. Not sure why this isn't just printed on the label. However, counts are very reasonable for portion size.  TIP: After placing your first order, immediately put a hold on all additional weeks until you try and decide if you want to continue. Freshly one requires NINETY-SIX hours (four whole days) notice in order to change or cancel any service, which is barely enough time to even eat what they ship before another one is on it's way.",

I get 6 meals/week (I'm on week 3) and it costs $60 which is $10 a meal and certainly less than what I'd spend if I pick something up at a restaurant. (And nowadays I feel like I have to tip the person who hands me the takeout meal.)  A fairly large box is delivered to my front door, I take the 6 meals out of the box, put them in the fridge, and I've got food for the week. I no longer have to spend my drive home figuring out which restaurant I'm going to stop at to pick up dinner. I hate any vegetable that is green (not counting lettuce) and wish I could get rid of the peas and string beans but I realize that not having to personalize meals probably keeps the price down. Some of my favorites include: Penne bolognese, steak peppercorn, turkey meatballs and linguine, turkey shepherd's pie, and slow cooked beef chili. I think there was maybe one or two meals that I wasn't thrilled with but there has been nothing that I had to throw out because I thought it was gross.  And the meals are a good portion size, at least for me; a big guy might think differently. All in all, no complaints.",

The Chicken Tikka Masala was OK, but the Trader Joe's frozen CTM is 100x better for 1/3rd of the price. I also order from Cooked, which is slightly more expensive, but the quality is outstanding compared to Freshly and the Cooked meals are much larger so I've been able to split them into 2-3 meals making it cheaper in the long run.

Again, I was using 2 other food delivery services and they never missed a delivery. Their only problem was cost. I think that Freshly does not plan that well and doesn't buy enough supplies to make all of the meals needed. If you are going to order from Freshly, order extra and put them in the freezer for when Freshly fails you.   Bottom line:  Good Food Good Customer Service Bad Reliability- Can't trust them to get the food to me  Looking back at all transactions with Freshly, there were 15 food orders paid for and 6 refunded. That's about a 60% delivery rate. NOT too good. Gonna start looking fo alternatives to Freshly.",

In fact, I'm giving two stars here because I genuinely like the company.  The problem is that the food just isn't very good.  I subscribed for two weeks, ordering six meals at a time.  The first shipment arrived on a Monday.  That's a big deal for me, as the whole reason I'm ordering a \"prepared meal kit\" is so that I can have healthy food to eat during the work week when I have less time to cook.  My first meal was a chicken breast cooked with some other stuff.  I can't remember exactly what it was, but it doesn't matter much.  The chicken breasts in all of their meals taste the same:  Like cardboard.  Over half of the dishes I ordered were chicken.  I quickly learned that chicken was not a viable option, and without the chicken, there really isn't much variety left on their menu.  I was able to cancel my subscription with no problem.  Kudos to them for making that process easy.  EDIT:  I did have a very good conversation with some of the Freshly representatives after posting my review here on Yelp.  They offered monetary compensation for my dissatisfaction which is something I appreciate.  I declined their offer simply because of the fact that I believe I got exactly what I paid for.  However, I did log in to add another star to my review.  This is a great company that is working on getting their legs underneath them.  As time goes by, I hope to see their product get better.  I will give them another try a year or so down the road because they have earned my business.",

One thing I don't like about Factor75 is they take 2 days in shipping to deliver while Freshly is next day. Factor75 is also more expensive and more calories but I think some of the meals have more flavor than Freshly but can't go wrong with either. Average cost per meal for Factor75 is around $13 while Freshly average cost is around $10 however coupons are much easier to find so I've ordered from Freshly about 5 times, each time average around $7/meal so almost half the cost which makes up for the slightly less flavor (which I can easily fix by adding some seasoning or sauces). Factor75 also tends to rotate meals more than Freshly. Which has its pros (variety) and cons (sometimes you can't reorder your favorites). Overall you can't go wrong with either. Both companies offer flexibility in cancelling weeks or restarting (within reason, obviously you can't cancel the day of after they already started making or shipped it). Factor75 I did enjoy the free bag it was a nice surprise.",

I ordered:   Sicilian Chicken Parmesan Meatloaf w/ Cauliflower Mash Chicken Fajitas w/ roasted corn (no tortillas) Breakfast platter of eggs, potato hash, and a sausage patty Denver Omelet with cheese BLT Omelet with cheese  I thoroughly enjoyed each meal although I am not a fan of uncured pork, it tastes too gamey for me so that made the omelets not really edible for my taste. The bacon and the ham were baked into the omelet so I could not pick it out and there was not much cheese inside at all. The omelets do not come with sides, a little veggie would be nice.   They use greek yogurt in a lot of their sauces, in the cauliflower mash and in the roasted corn and I'm not a huge fan of yogurt but again, just personal preference.   I canceled my subscription simply because there aren't yet enough vegetarian options on the menu, I only saw one and it was a penne pasta, that is something not hard to make on my own even when I am ill. If they ever offer a lot more vegetarian options and switch to a cured bacon I'll try it again.   If those things don't matter to you, you will likely find the dishes fast and fresh and very easy to make. I would recommend this to a friend with fewer food issues.  I will definitely keep checking back weekly to see if they add new items and more vegetarian fare, even though I'm not a vegetarian I like to opt for those non meat items especially for food delivery.",

    "text": "The food is ok. I really loved the fact that it was never frozen. Also, I loved the convenience. The food was similar to TV dinners in taste. The meatballs and spaghetti squash were my favorite out of the 6 meals I ordered. The protein tends to be far superior to the sides. The green beans were pretty much inedible in my chicken with butternut mac and cheese. At $12.50 a meal, the quality just wasn't good enough. I might pay $7 a meal, for the convenience,  but the food still is not good. The portions were fine for me. I had no problems with delivery. I've tried at least 5 food delivery services which are approximately the same price per meal, and this is my least favorite.  I canceled my subscription after one delivery.  Update:  their customer service gets a 5 star review from me. I really believe they're going to try to improve their product, and if I hear that they do in the future, I'll give them a try again.",

Out of the eight meals I've had so far every single meal has been semi cold or so watery it is inedible until u take a paper towel to it. The cooking instructions always require at least three-four minutes of additional cooking time on top of the recommended amount. I follow the exact instructions for storage and cooking and the results are always terrible. Reached out to customer service and got a generic response to cook it longer if it's still frozen. Food is terrible unless you typically pour about a cup of water onto your meals prior to eating them. Look elsewhere if you want meal delivery.",

Honestly, there's frozen dinners that I like ALOT more than what I tried this week.  I updated my review because Freshly reached out to discuss my complaint and that was actually very nice of them.

My food was delivered today and it looks very pathetic. I'm so disappointed with the size and quality. It looks like a TV dinner and it tastes like one too. So far I have tried the veggie baked penne. Loaded with fat for such a small portion size. I canceled immediately. Don't waste your money. Go to the grocery store and buy frozen TV dinners, they last longer and are way cheaper. Edit: I bumped it up to three stars because the peppercorn steak is really delicious.

    "text": "Truly Awesome  Okay, I will start this with saying I have never had an issue with Freshly not getting me my boxes on time, but I can see how that would be frustrating for sure. I have always gotten my boxes when I ordered them, I suppose I'm lucky there!  But besides that, I am genuinely having a hard time understanding the negative reviews for Freshly. In fact, I decided to leave a review because I know they deserve it and there were too many bad ones floating around.   Freshly is, simply, awesome. I have used it when I lived alone, and it fed me for a full week (lunches and dinners). And I have used it when I lived with others for dinners for us all. It is a life-saver. While I admire and wish I was like those people who meal-prep religiously, I'm just not there right now. These meals are all so great. I have recommended it to everyone I know, and my sister has since signed up.   The meals are fresh, delicious, and so so easy. Of course, there are some meals I like better than others, but... that is how normal human everything works. It's a taste preference.   On nights we haven't cooked, we get to come home to a real meal. On days I haven't packed lunch, I get to bring in a healthy meal to work (although it is a big lunch portion, cards on the table). I have not had a single meal that was an upsetting portion size. I love having a serving of veggies with the meals, I love putting something in the microwave and being done. They do expire relatively quickly (4-6 days, ish), but honestly that made me feel better since they are made with real fresh ingredients. And real fresh ingredients don't last forever.   This is an awesome service for people who lead busy lives. I'm sure the people with negative reviews have their own reasons, but seriously -- I cannot recommend this service enough. I am all in, no questions.",

I like the variety though after 3 weeks I like to change the order a bit.  The issue is really the sodium level of each entree which can be in the 500-600 range.  It seems high for most people.  I just canceled my subscription due to the fact that once I get the order there is only 3 days left before the 'use by' date.  The advice is to just freeze them but honestly if it takes 3 days to get them delivered having a $10 frozen dinner doesn't seem to be the best plan of attack.  I got my friday delivery on sat so don't have the ability to eat 6 meals in 3 days.  I love the concept but think if they can't deliver quicker its not a good option unless you live in Az or NY.",

I would give five stars, but the price is a bit high. But I do appreciate a lot on the fully recyclable packaging instead of styrofoam packaging cooler that all the meat delivery companies use.

I don't order it as often as I use to because I would like more variety. They did add a few new meals over the 2017 holiday season but now I've tried those too. A few meals I don't mind having every week - the chicken livorno is my favorite, and my husband loves the baked penne marinara.   If you haven't tried freshly yet, it is definitely worth a go. On the rare occasions I haven't been able to finish the meals before their best by date (about 5 days from the day they are delivered) I've found that some meals freeze and reheat well.

Not only do the meals arrive cold in their ice packed box, but the food and customer service are outstanding!

Freshly takes care of that all for you with perfectly portioned ready to go meals. The food is incredibly delicious, healthy, and makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. The two times I have had to contact customer service (to change my delivery date and a billing error) they were quick to resolve my concerns.

    "text": "So, here we are all these months later.  I continue to love the comedy writing here from the disgruntled people: \"It didn't have enough pepper or salt.\"  Here's a crazy idea - go to your cupboard and get out those little shakers that say salt and pepper.  Shake them onto your food.  I know this requires some effort but the exercise is good for you.  Same with any other seasoning you may want to use to perk things up.  Then there are the \"three days to eat everything\" folks.  Not quite - I eat them over four days and have never had an incident in doing so, plus they can be frozen, rather like some people's brains.    Here's the thing about Freshly and probably any of these services - learn.  Learn what you like and don't like, when it's best to receive, how to parse them out.  I frequently eat one for lunch, jog, then later eat one for dinner - easy to lose weight that way.  Another thing to learn: You can cancel a week anytime you like - very easy to do, you're always sent an e-mail and there you are.  I don't do it every week, and sometimes a month goes by, but I usually come back to it because it's just convenient.  The one time I either didn't get the e-mail or it went into the ether and I saw they charged me, I simply picked up this thing called the telephone, called their easy to locate phone number, and even though it was a day after the cancel time, they canceled anyway and immediately refunded that money.  Whether you end up loving this company or not, the one thing you cannot say is that they don't have great customer service, because if you say that I will come over to your house and conk you on the head with a Freshly meal or, maybe even a churro.    The meals: They switch 'em up every now and then, which is nice, but I tend to like the ones I like.  I've tried a lot of them - they're all well prepared but obviously not everyone is going to like everything.  For example, I would rather have a truck drive through my forehead than order anything called pork carnitas.  I'm very fond of the meatloaf (I do add ketchup, just because I do that), I like the sausage and peppers, the bolognese, the chicken risotto used to be better but it's still pretty good, the chilis are all good, so plenty to choose from.  And to the people who say there isn't enough variety - my guess is that the people saying that go to restaurants and always order the same thing, and when they cook at home they always make the same five dishes.  What's the difference, folks?  I haven't tried the breakfast stuff because I don't like eating in the morning.  I've recommended Freshly to any number of people - people on diets tell me they prefer it to Jenny Craig, for example.    And once again to the people who say these are like frozen dinners - go have a frozen dinner sometime, because these are nothing like any frozen dinner I've ever had.  Also, as they recommend I, too, would recommend plating the meal.  Good delivery date is important, too - Monday - Wednesday work really well - I do Wednesdays but the arrive very late in the afternoon thank to the always non-superior delivery skills of ONTRAC, so I usually eat one that evening, two on Thursday, two on Friday, and the final one on Saturday.  Works really well.  So, that is my update for Freshly, whether you want it or not.",

    "text": "So disappointing. We end up eating too many microwave meals in our household so I thought this would be a better alternative to frozen meals from the supermarket. I was wrong. I tried a number of different meals but didn't find one that was better than a frozen meal, yet these cost $10 per one person meal! I ordered multiple of each particular meal for each of my four family members. After trying one of each different meal the other meals were usually thrown out because nobody would eat them. As I didn't want to waste meals that I had paid $10 each for, I forced myself to eat some of them. Most of them were thrown out though. Honestly, airline food is much better. Totally wasted my money. I cancelled my weekly subscription yet was still forced to pay for two more weeks of these meals. Be warned: you cannot cancel straight away",

    "text": "Single working mama here.....  My daughters are 3 and 4.  Once upon a time, I used to cook dinner every night.  Then I had kids and I cooked a few nights/week.  Then, my marriage fell apart, I started working full time with full custody and ended up in denial that the most I was cooking was Trader Joe's frozen meals and eggs.  I had become a Gilmore Girl!!!   Oooooh.... And my kids (that I thought would only eat healthy food ever) were having fast food on a regular basis.  I just couldn't get organized.  It was too much for me to balance, at this time in my life.  And.... It took me too long to try something like Freshly.  I felt sooooo much guilt!  My kids were growing up without home cooked food....  And then sometimes I would cook food and they would barely eat any (like typical 3 and 4 year olds).... and I would feel so defeated.  Anyways.... back to Freshly.  Now, Post-Freshly, I pick up my kids from preschool at 5pm ish, take them to the park or botanical gardens or pool for 1:1 time for about an hour.  We get home and dinner is ready in 5 minutes.  It is on the table in less than 10 minutes.  We eat together as a FAMILY!!  And it tastes like home cooked food (definitely a difference in freshness from Trader Joe's).  We get to practice setting a table, we say a prayer, we talk about our day and they are exposed to a variety of healthy foods. And there is no need for fast food.  My meals are planned. If my kids don't feel like eating it, it is no big deal because I didn't slave over a hot stove for 45 minutes.  There is no pressure.  It is also helpful in my dieting.  I have struggled with losing weight, mostly because of the difficulty cooking it, planning it, etc.  The calories are listed and there is no need to ever just grab dinner somewhere.    Really... a game changer!  I also love the frozen packs it comes with. And the lack of cleaning dishes from cooking. And if you are sharing food with a toddler or preschooler, (like me), there is usually enough to split, if they aren't big night time eaters.  And because we were eating out so much, it's not even costing more.  Win all around.  Thank you, Freshly!  **Oh and I see some pictures above of the food in the container it comes in.  I HIGHLY recommend plating it.  I bet it even tastes better plated (even if just psychological), it def. looks better and removes all feeling of TV dinners.",

    "text": "Definitely would not recommend if you are trying to lose weight, want to eat clean, care about the environment, or don't like feeling bloated. Decided to give Freshly a try after receiving countless emails about a discounted rate with a subscription. The price point was appealing, and since I knew the upcoming weekends would be busy (when I normally meal prep), I thought I would finally give it a try. I signed up for the flex12 meal plan, which included 12 meals per week. This would be enough for my husband and I to go through. We picked out a variety of meals (mostly chicken), and eagerly awaited our first delivery. My first meal, Morrocan Chicken was pretty good, however the plastic film covering the container is incredibly difficult to peel back. The meal had a good amount of flavor, left me full, but also left me incredibly bloated. The next few days I tried out a few more meals including: Steak Peppercorn (not a fan), Chicken Risotto (Disgustingly fatty), Chicken Fajita (probably my favorite) and Southwest Chicken Bowl (this was okay, but way too filling for me).   The portion sized are not for everyone. As a young woman who wants to maintain my weight, the macros don't fit. The majority of the meals have over 25g Fat and over 40g Carbs. Plus the sodium is comparable to eating Fast food. I felt bloated every day I ate one of these meals.  For what it claims to be - fresh, healthy,  and convenient, I feel slightly misled. Is does not taste fresh; just look at all of the random ingredients on the back. It is not \"healthy\" to most peoples standards, unless you want to eat something that sounds healthy but the macro nutrients are comparable to eating fast food. It is somewhat convenient but sacrifices the environment with the amount of packaging used to deliver and store the meals.   I would only recommend if you are in DESPERATE need of food and use the coupon.",

Definitely a learning experience. The concept is DOA. Get your fresh food from a kitchen at a trusted restaurant or store where the human element is there serving it to you. Delivery is definitely the point of failure for Freshly.  Sorry about it but people need to know what kind of risk they are taking with this service. I'm sorry for the entrepreneurs and investors responsible for Freshly. Guys this model isn't going to work.. unless your marketing team can convince people it's okay to get sick.

As much as I think there should be more in their rotation, I still get more variety than if I cooked for myself, and it tastes better when someone else cooks, even if it does come packaged. Some meals are a real hit for me, like the steak and the salmon cakes. Some are not so hot on my list, like some of the numerous chicken filet entries. The bibimbap was sort of okay, but I won't do it again. I guess one of the hard things I deal with is that while I eat a bit better, I also feel lazy, so it is a tossup. Maybe they can add a dessert once in a while to the box. In fact, they give up a real marketing opportunity by only putting in the receipt.",

    "text": "We're on our fifth week of Freshly. We are doing 12 meals a week, which is enough for six dinners. I don't think we've had one bad meal. We've had a decent number that we wouldn't order again, but there have also been some really great meals. At this price point I set my expectations accordingly as we are paying $9 all in for the meal. I assume the price would be a decent amount lower if they didn't have to deliver the meals. What I really enjoy is the variety and the convenience. My wife really loves fish and I do not. So it's allowed us to some nights have different meals based on preference. You save a decent amount of time not having to cook and trips to the grocery store have been reduced.  I will say some meals that have sausage don't seem to have enough flavor in the meat. I assume Freshly is playing it safe to make sure it's acceptable to a wider base of their subscribers. We can easily add a little powered red cayenne pepper or salt for more flavor.  We've actually lost a decent amount of weight with these meals as it helps train your stomach to what a proper portion is and you don't get a chance to overeat.  Customer service is top notch. It's too bad they don't add some extra freebies or free samples (snacks).  Negatives: Some of the meals don't feel like a good value at $9 per meal. For example, the chilli and pasta (with meat) aren't on par with the fish or steak meals. If you went to Sprouts you'd be able to pick up a pasta dish twice as large with twice as much meat for $6.   You never know when in the day the delivery will come. It may come at 8am and sit in the sun or 6pm. I like that they send you a text letting you know when it has arrived. I've not had any meals spoil.  I wish they made it a bit easier to recycle the gel packs and that you could recycle the insulation for the delivery box. It's too bad they don't use re-usable packaging.   We do the 12 meal plan and wished they allowed for larger discount for 14 meals or more so we could get enough meals for the all our dinners each week.  Because you have to put your order in one week in advance it can be a bit difficult to know what you are in the mood for, what meals you are tired off, or if you trying a new meal you aren't sure if you should get it two weeks in a row since you don't know if you'll like it.",

My very first week with them, I see what is no doubt a not uncommon occurrence--I get an email warning me my food \"might not arrive on time\" and to throw it away when it gets here and \"we will refund your money.\"   Freshly, this is your one and only chance. When this happens again, I will immediately cancel my subscription. What the hell good is it if you can't get my food to me on time? Now I have to re-plan an entire week of meals. I don't have time for this kind of headache and what is supposed to be a convenience with Freshly so far has been nothing but a hassle.   Also--that seems like a good way to eliminate one week of my twenty-dollar discount, so you will also give my my full forty dollar discount by extending the discounted price an extra week. If you don't, I'll be adding to this review. And yes, I WILL be sharing the hell out of this review on Facebook.  UPDATE  AUGUST 30, 2019.  For some reason, I decided to renew with Freshly, even though their food is just a step above a TV dinner. Lo and behold, the trouble with this company picked back up. I skipped August 31. Why? This is LSU's season opener and there will be 250K tailgating within a few blocks of me. Mail doesn't get through on game days. Even though I skipped, I get an email: \"Hooray! Your food has shipped!\"   I swear, this company is obtuse. They must get Walmart rejects to staff their distribution. And again, their food is just meh. I thought I'd try again after the first review mainly because I don't have time to cook for one. But hey, stay far away from this company.",

The online platform looks great, was easy, and worked well. But the positive comments will end here.  I tried the 6 meal plan, and ordered a mix of vegetarian and meat options. Every single one of the three options I tasted were *actively* inedible - and I certainly do not claim to have a difficult palate to satisfy. The Grilled Chicken Pesto Risotto, Super Pesto & Veggie Fusilli, and Almond-Ginger Chicken Bowl were not only \"not delicious\", they often left me feeling like I needed to cleanse my palate with something else in my fridge because of their aftertaste.   I have three meals left, and literally can't bring myself to finish them. My roommate had the same experience - she threw out three of her boxes.  For the purported value add (cost, convenience, price) - especially in comparison to similarly-priced meals and fast-casual veggie bowls at Sweetgreen, Cava, Chipotle or otherwise) - this was shockingly bad.   The business idea has potential - they just need to actually make the food taste good.",

At first I was happy with the ordering and delivery process, but recently, I've been receiving far too frequent notifications that my shipments are delayed, sometimes by an entire business day. The inconsistency is more than annoying--it's troubling for someone who plans their meals around their Freshly delivery. Essentially, no Freshly, no dinner. The greatest annoyance was returning from a trip over a holiday weekend to discover that my order was cancelled due to my delivery date falling on the holiday. I can understand limited delivery availability on holidays, but here's the issue: I was not notified of the cancellation--I found out by opening the app to see why the delivery hadn't been made. Why not notify the customer? And why not move the delivery date to the day following the holiday rather than cancelling the order. I reached out to Freshly through their app to share my feedback, but the response was that I should contact them two weeks ahead of upcoming holidays to see if alternate delivery dates are available. Something seems backward about this. Shouldn't Freshly be proactive about letting customers know of adjustments to the level of service they provide? I hope Freshly can use feedback like this to resolve service pain points as I do believe the meals are decent. Time will tell.",

    "text": "It's time for an HONEST update because Freshly (Megan) kindly reached out and tried to make it all right for me. I did get my order this time, Yay! Here's the deets:   The box showed up at my door nice and early, carefully packed up and colder than the abominable snowman's heart. Some folks have complained about the packaging and how the meals look like mush. Quite frankly, I think they are insane. I don't see how you can make food that's been shipped (and presumably thrown around by the carrier) any better than it was. It's fine! I took some tips from other reviewers and cooked 2 meals partially in a pan -- totally helps the texture!  Here are my thoughts from the last haul:  Pulled Pork - Mushy and a little watery. Microwaved and probably should have thrown in a pan. Pork needed a little more umami flavor. 6/10  Teriyaki Salmon Cakes - Pan fried the meal for better texture. Salty Salmon - presumably from the teriyaki. Vegetables were ok. 6.5/10  Chicken Tikka Masala - Sauce was seriously on point. More chickpeas than I would have thought were in it. Some pieces of chicken were burnt?  6/10  Buffalo Chicken - Sauce tasted like franks red hot (yum). Chicken was juicy. Potato side was also very flavorful. 7.5/10  Southwestern Chicken + The Vegetarian variant - Loved the colors, vegetables, the quinoa etc. My SO thought the lime sauce had TOO much cilantro, while I did not mind it at all! Veggie portion wasn't totally filling, maybe needed more protein, but I liked it a lot. 8.5/10   Overall, good but not great! I will be getting a second shipment with completely different food so I will update if necessary. One thing to note: despite being fresh, some dishes have more sodium than others so do look at the labels carefully and drink an extra glass of water if sensitive :)",

    "text": "Freshly was a Godsend especially, when I traveled weekly for work. I was rarely home, in fact I think I spent more time up in the air than sleeping on my own bed! LMAO....  And since I did all of the cooking when I was home, I spoiled my Sweetheart who is culinary challenged (or maybe lazy?)  Hahaha.... The things we do for love!  Anyways, this review is long over due.  When I used Freshly's service, they have always been great. Not to mention very easy to reorder your meals. For those who are not familiar with Freshly, they can plan, prepare and cook your meals fresh, and ships them overnight to your home.  The meals are very fresh so they need to be consumed usually within a week's time, or follow the recommended expiration date stamped on the package.  Now just so you understand,  Freshly isn't for everybody. But, if you travel a lot like I did, or you know well ahead you're going to be busy,  or simply just want something ready to eat when you get home from a long day at work but you want your food fresh not frozen,  this is the perfect option. I think they are also perfect gifts for friends and family.   One of the cool service Freshly provides is that you can choose when you want your meals ship. For example, when I knew in advanced that I will be home for two weeks during a certain month, I only had my weekly meals sent twice a month. Those two shipments provided almost two weeks of dinner, or a week if you have them for lunch and dinner.  You can opt out completely and put your meal orders on hold, or choose specific dates well in advanced when you would like Freshly to ship your fresh meals again. You have full control.  Looking back, my personal favorite which I don't think they have it on their menu now was their \"Grilled Flat Iron Skirt Steak with Spinach.\" It was so tasty and tender. Their \"Southwest Chicken Bowl\" was another favorite of mine.  Super moist and tasted very fresh.  Cheers!",

For my breakfast and lunch I do smoothie boxes, Trader Joe's salad kits or make my own salads or soups. Sometimes I do crock pot meals too. But every now and then I have those days where I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown, and  I just don't have the energy to make something fresh. That's when freshly steps in.   Honestly, I don't know what people are complaining about and saying they taste like TV dinners...but maybe, just maybe,  I've hacked the Freshly code, and have become the king Midas of frozen meals? You see, I season my food thoroughly before I cook it,  and I also don't use the microwave. I have a toaster oven with a pressure cooker setting on it. So, I take the food out of the container, plate it on foil paper, and place it in the toaster oven on a pressure cooker setting. With that being said, take these tips, and use them to level the food up. I'm telling you, everything I've had has been bomb from them using these methods! I've tried the meatballs with spaghetti squash, and also the buffalo chicken. They both gave me life, and left me satisfied without feeling gross. I'll be ordering from Freshly monthly, freezing my meals, and heating them up.",

    "text": "My boyfriend surprised me with weekly Freshly deliveries while he is gone on business for a little over a month, since he usually cooks for us (he's a keeper I know). I'm kind of a food snob so I worried these meals would be bland or just meh, but I have to say I have been pleasantly surprised! I've had around 5 of the meals so far and liked every single one. I like the app - you can easily select/switch out meals and also update the quantity for future orders. My only compliant is the lack of portion size options. I wish I could opt for some smaller ones (in the 300-450 calorie range) for weight-loss or even a Paleo or other healthy option. I realize they have some meals marked as being under 500 calories, but there's not a convenient way to sort or filter those meals. Other than that, I'm a Freshly fan and would recommend.",

    "text": "I'm not sure why all the bad reviews. Overall, I've had a positive experience with the two shipments I received from them. I had the $40 off promo ($20 off 2 deliveries). The meals were good. Some can be a little bland, but hey this is a healthy meal delivery service and most of them are under 500 calories. The portions are great and I finish up my lunch or dinner feeling completely satisfied, unlike a lot of other prepared meals that are less than 500 calories. A lot of the noodle dishes are gluten free and there are also vegetarian and keto options. It IS a tad on the pricier side (about $10 on average per meal) $60 for six. It's not something I can really afford every week (it ends up being $240 a month if you order each week for 24 meals...and you still have to figure out the other 66 (assuming you eat 3 meals a day) for the month) I do like it better than say Blue Apron or Hello Fresh, because with these, you're saving a lot of time otherwise spent in the kitchen prepping and cooking. Another note I'll make is on the selection of dishes. They have a decent selection, but they don't often rotate out items except for one here and there, so that can get a bit tiresome and repetitive after a while.",

    "text": "Second update (4months later):   There are still delivery issues. Once every month or two the meals don't arrive, or arrive a day early (when no one is home so they sit in the sun all day and are unusable). There is never any contact to warn of the problem. You just have to wait and see if they'll actually show up or not.   They always refund the money. In the past they would also credit the amount of my typical order. This made it (sort of) worth putting up with the hassle of being surprised with no meals when it's too late to plan anything else. Today's meals did not arrive and they are \"so sorry\" and say it's a \"carrier issue\" (pass the buck much?) and are only offering a credit of $20. It's starting to look like I'll need to find something more reliable.   [first] Update: the order was credited and I got an additional credit for my next order to be free. So... I placed a new order. Today it's supposed to arrive. I checked the tracking and it's not coming. Called them and they can see the order, don't know what happened, it never shipped, apologies apologies. Supposedly they're sending out a new one to be delivered tomorrow.   Three of my last 4 orders (12 meals each)... ghosted. Possibly the single least reliable company I've ever dealt with. It would almost be funny if it wasn't such a pain. It's not like I'm ordering a set of throw pillows and delays are no big deal. These are supposed to be my meals for the week! And they just ... don't arrive. No warning. No message saying not able to fulfill your order.   I keep looking around to see if I'm secretly being filmed for an episode of candid camera or \"What would you do?\" because it's so absurd.",

    "text": "I've been ordering Freshly for about a year and a half now and I can still say I'm a fan.  6 dinners per week.  The food is consistently good, and though I'd like a bit more variety....there is still enough that I enjoy my meals.    I started Freshly at the same time that I decided to lose weight, it has helped tremendously by ensuring the portions were reasonable, filling and healthy.  It also provides a detailed description of ingredients and calories etc, which allows me to keep track of my intake on my fitness app. (I've lost 70 lbs).     It's not always been perfect, deliveries were delayed by weather, or a poor delivery driver failed to deliver, but in all cases, Freshly made it right.   They couldn't magically make the food appear, but they did make it right financially.  In the scheme of things, I've had about 75 plus deliveries, and probably 5 had issues....that's better than Amazon....lol    So here's my take, if you need good tasty filling meals at a reasonable price,  to save time, eat healthy, or just to try something new, this could be a good service for you.  One final thing, if you're single or even a couple and always using the excuse that cooking for one or two is a pain....this could be your answer.",

The food has been at least 4/5 stars, with some standouts like the peppercorn steak and the beef lime chili bowl. Yummy stuff! I do the 12 meal plan so this basically takes care of lunch and dinner most days. It's so much more economical than doing a ton of takeout or overbuying groceries. I especially recommend it for people who do meal prep because this gives you a bigger variety of food while also keeping portions under control. My recommendations are to make it easier to recycle the frozen gel packs and to look into cardboard/paper trays instead of plastic. I also have an almond allergy, so maybe more non tree nut options. And have you considered breakfast? Anyway, I plan on sticking with Freshly for a long time to come and recommend anyone reading this to give them a try. :)",

    "text": "I've been using Freshly out here in Maryland. Before Freshly, I used TerritoryFoods for about 8 months so I am able to compare the two (they are competitors). Saw nutritionist who mentioned to use Territory to help lose weight.  So I used them first. I think that Freshly has better tasting food than Territory, in my opinion. Website is neat and organized and I haven't had any problems with delivery. They have good support (online chat). I have expanded my orders for other members of my household so I am giving them more business now.  Areas for improvement:  1. Add more meal types (Territory consistently has about 4 times the number of meals types that Freshly has and was always adding new meals every week). Freshly meal types don't seem to change at all or much.  2. Consider adding a 'breakfast' style meal. All of the meals seem geared towards either lunch or dinner.  3. Consider adding different meal portions (say regular, large). Territory offers small, medium, large. Large allows a person to stay full easier. Large would be around 700 calories versus 450 calories.  4. Consider changing your cellphane-tight-wrap -- I often have difficulty getting this off - its quite messy normally. Territory packaging was better.  Overall, I think that Freshly is better than Territory (just by a little bit, considering the above.. however, Freshly has the potential to be way better than Territory if they address the above)",

    "text": "After getting food delivery from apps and local restaurants for quite some time, I was looking for a healthier alternative without compromising time and convenience.  I just finished my first week of Freshly. Overall I'm satisfied.  Delivery: no issues. I do find the package very large and heavy but unfortunately this is needed until someone comes up with a better solution.  Serving size: Smaller than most restaurant dishes. The portion is fulfilling for me but definitely too small for my boyfriend. I would say it's around 70% of what you get from a restaurant.  Taste: Homey, less flavorful than most restaurant dishes and overall gear towards the American palate. Out of the six dishes I tried, one was not good at all but I'd be interested in reordering the other five. For an average person, some Freshly foods might be a little bland. But after eating restaurant foods for a long time, I actually enjoy foods that don't have lots of spice in them.  Price: I'm currently getting the introductory offer. Each meal comes down to $8. Without the introductory offer, it would be $10 per meal. I'll probably stick with them if the ongoing price is $8. At $10, I would be more diligent into researching other options.  Overall, I like the convenience and transparency regarding the ingredients and nutritional facts.",

    "text": "I've subscribed to Freshly for about 3 months, and receive 6 meals weekly. The meals tend to favor American \"home cooking\" flavors. My top 4 are the: steak peppercorn, teriyaki salmon cakes, homestyle chicken, and Lebanese-style beef meatballs. I genuinely look forward to eating those dishes, and the rest are passably good (except the bibimbop, which was terrible). I primarily use them for work lunches, as they're pre-packaged and easy to grab on my way out the door. Every time I eat one in the lounge, coworkers comment on how good they smell and ask about them.   That being said, I'll probably end my subscription soon. Why? 1) Lack of variety. They don't switch up the menu very often, and already a lot of the meals are based around a chicken breast and green beans. 2) Delivery date. My deliveries arrive on Thursday evening, which isn't ideal when I want these to take to work. Like others have mentioned, the meals are packaged about 2 days before you receive them, so if I wait 'til the the following work week, they're getting kind of old. 3) Plastic containers. All of my cups, plates, and food storage containers are glass. I'm a bit squeamish about microwaving my food in plastic for 3+ mins.",

    "text": "Pro: Meals are shipped and require no thought for eating healthy.   Con: packaging is all plastic; ingredients are \"natural\" but no indication of whether they are organic (which I'd expect at $10 per meal); some meals were more like an appetizer than an actual meal; and I would eat 3 of them between lunch, early dinner, and late dinner.   My experience: they couldn't get the first box to me on time so it was scrapped. I don't want to go all \"first world problems,\" but I rely heavily on meal kits for my food throughout the week, and that left me with no meals mid-week.   The billing was confusing, and they charge you when it's ordered, not delivered (box 1 was ordered on 1/6 And didn't ship until 1/28). I purchased 4 boxes, and all had a different price. The first box was refunded since it took 4 days to deliver and they instructed to discard. Box 1 was 87.99 and then refunded. Box 2 was 69.52. Box 3 was 89.97 and box 4 was 100.19 for a total of 259.68.   They offered a $20 inconvenience for the hassle from the first week. The second week, an item was replaced so they gave a $10 credit.   On balance, the other criticisms here are fair. For the money, you could go to Chipotle and get a veggie bowl for $8 and that could feed you for two meals based on comparable Freshly serving sizes, and is more eco friendly.",

Deliveries were, with one exception, on time and even that one they took care of with credit. Their customer service is quite good.  When I first signed up, the cardboard that wrapped around meals had some interesting reading inside but that went away. Then breakfast options went away too but I hadn't used them much as they seemed overpriced for $10.  Meals like Steak Peppercorn, Buffalo Chicken with Butternut Mac & Cheese, and Salmon Teriyaki Cakes were good. The petite green beans got old...aren't there some other sides? Also not enough seafood options.  In a business like this I think you've gotta rotate through upwards of 100 meals to keep it interesting or at least swap out sides or something!  Meals were pretty healthy and reasonably sized. All under about 600 calories and without wheat, preservatives, and bs like that.  At the end of the day, while it is a bit of a pain, if you're in *any* way competent at cooking, your own freshly prepared meals will taste better than this shipped long distances stuff.",

We are trying to cut back on our spending on the road and the amount of fast food consumed. Freshly works great for me, as I am only home on the weekends and have zero desire to meal prep, and would much rather enjoy my time off.   Sure I could make healthier options at home, sure I would use less plastic, and it might cost a little less. However, the time saved is worth it to me.   The options don't change too dramatically week to week, but there are enough options to keep a decent rotation going. The portions are small by most people's standards - however - they are what most people should be consuming! I like that I can sort by sugar, fat, carbs, and many other options to pick my meals. So far there haven't been any I didn't like. I will avoid the sausage based dishes because the one I had was slightly greasy, but it's sausage! That's to be expected, still tasted great.   Since we both travel, we freeze our meals and throw them in lunch bags we fly with. Tsa flags our bags due to the fact that it's hard to see through being frozen. However, we never have problems getting our food on the plane! In my bag, I can travel for 4 hours, leave the meals in my car for another 3 and the meals are still frozen.   This is a great option for people on the road! They really should market it to road warriors!",

We are refunding you in full for this order - and, as a thank you for your patience and understanding, we have given you $30 off your next order.

I was excited to have healthy meals and figured I'd go with more of \"an established brand\" than a local supplier but I was let all the way down.

Choosing meals for the week is easy, ingredient lists are comprehensive so I can check for allergens, portions are good, and shipping is reliable. Although, OnTrac never tells me when the delivery arrives. For roughly $7 a meal, it's a great alternative for eating lunch out (which gets pricey in a downtown office)!",

    "text": "We've only had it for a week now with 6 meals. Both my wife and I have been very positively surprised I must say.  Over the years, we tried all kinds of home-meal delivery services, out of a desire to eat fresh and healthy food at home. Usually we gave up with the first shipment already when we realized how much work it is to actually prepare a meal. It's just not something that we enjoy after both of us spend the whole day at work, so normally we would just order something from Doordash or Postmastes. We basically never cook at home.  Freshly is a perfect addition to that. It's a lot cheaper than getting food from Doordash and in many cases also cheaper than getting takeout from other places that we love, like Tender Greens or Sweetgreen. Sure, it's not the same thing, but it also has the convenience that it's already in the fridge and only takes about 3-5 minutes for a decent quality meal.  I also like the packaging, which seems very environmentally friendly and the whole philosophy of using natural, high quality ingredients. Wish they would offer organic as an upgrade.  My only complaint is portion size. 400-500 calories is just not enough for a dinner. Eating two meals doesn't seem to be a good solution because then it's too much. The price is really low at about $10 per meal, especially if you consider the cost of packaging and shipping, but honestly, we would happily pay more and have 30-40% larger portions. It would be awesome if they had a way to let you choose portion size.  Overall, very happy so far. I think we might stick with this service.",

    "text": "I'm here to set the record straight. I've been using Freshly for about 2 years and they're great. Before Freshly I was using Snap and here's how Freshly beats Snap.   Convenience: Freshly saves me about 10-15 hours every week. I don't have to cook for 2 hours a day, nor do I have to go to the grocery store. That equates to almost $100,000 a year in saved time when multiplied time saved by my hourly pay rate. Hands down, a no-brainer.   Taste/Food: I cook professionally, dine at high-end restaurants, I'm a foodie that only eats at the highest rated restaurants regardless of the price. Freshly's food is good. It's usually not highly seasoned, which is OK because I can season it.  The food lasts over 7 days in the fridge and I can freeze and reheat the meals all the time and the taste is consistent. Snap's meals don't last for more than 1-2 days.  Portions are about right. Not a lot of small portions - just right.   Delivery: When I started the service the delivery was on Thursday but I was able to change my delivery to Mondays starting the next week. The deliveries are always on time, intact, and still cold.   Menu: They have a good menu and change selection. Of course, more selection would be nice, but they change it around often enough to make it OK.  Customer Service: Support is great about doing everything they can to take care of their customers which is rare these days. GREAT customer service.   Price:  Unlike a lot Yelper's, I'm not broke and don't make references to prices specifically. Value perhaps, but not price. Freshly is cheap. I order 12 meals every week and I pay around $9 per meal.   CONS:  They need organic meals, more beef meals (I'm Blood Type O), fresh salads and snacks would be nice, more breakfast options,",

Last week it was too arrive Wednesday by 9pm (weekly)...it didn't arrive until Friday night around 10pm. OnTrac, their delivery partner, is a joke. Last week they said it was a flat tire. It's Wednesday evening and of course my order is not here. I called OnTrac and this week it's a road closure...LMAO. It is insulting to be told these clearly bogus lies.   Ordering these meals is a huge convenience for me. I'm a busy person and loathe fast food. I live alone and don't like to cook. Freshly is a great solution for me. But when your food doesn't arrive you have to figure something else out. It's a major pain and super inconvenient!   So it a disappointment to have to write this review....I've given them a couple dozen chances and today I'll be cancelling my subscription...which I've had for a very long time.   You've been warned.. if you want your food to be truly 'fresh'...don't count on it as long as Freshly is using OnTrac...a total joke of a company...to deliver your very expensive meals.",

    "text": "I was eager to try Freshly after taking a look at all the other food delivery services.  Most of them required that you had two buy two portions each time, and I needed a single portion.  The menu items looked good so I decided to give it a try.  After two nights of trying the food, I cancelled.  The main problem with the food is that it wouldn't cook in the microwave.  I followed the directions carefully, and still the food was ice cold when I took it out.  I had to try reheating; by that time, everything was awful.  The pepper steak was tough and the vegetables bland.   I had to toss everything and go pick up something else for dinner from the store.  I didn't want to try another one of the dinners.  I had tried a chicken dish the evening before, and it was just okay.  I use the microwave every day, and there is no problem with its heating anything else.  I have no idea what I will do with the unused dinners.  The dogs may enjoy them as they're not very discriminating.  I wish this would have worked out and that I could give Freshly a positive review.  It looks to me as though they need to reconfigure cooking times.",

    "text": "I've been eating Freshly as my primary food source for about six months, now, and overall it works for me.  The Good: I'm very happy with the quality of the food. I'm healthier, and have lost over 35 pounds since starting Freshly. When properly prepared, the portions are a good size for me. I think the price is fair ($9/meal on the 12 meal plan) especially when you factor in the time you saved not having to shop, cook, or clean up. The convenience keeps me from eating junk, and it's been really good for my health. Also, customer service has always been friendly and quick to credit me (even when they couldn't help with delivery issues, for example).  Where Freshly could improve: I had delivery issues early on, and they were super inconvenient. Since late deliveries get trashed, you're stuck having to come up with last-minute food plans for the next week.  Variety: When you're eating two Freshly meals a day, six days a week, you need more variety than Freshly provides. There are a few things I don't get tired of (buffalo chicken, risotto, SW chicken bowl) but I really try not to get more than two of any meal per week, so sometimes I'm ordering things I don't love just because I'm so tired of eating the things I do love. No bueno. Also, FYI Freshly, I don't want to \"hack\" my meal for variety. Meal prep is your job; I don't want to have to think about it. Portions: Sometimes I get a meal that's freakishly small, or they forgot to put the chicken in, or something, and that's frustrating. But, this hasn't happened in a couple of months, so maybe their QA/QC has improved.   Overall, Freshly is awesome!",

    "text": "I wanted to search a little online today and see if I was the only one who experienced, this past week, a missed delivery. Turns out this seems to be a fairly regular occurrence, sadly.   First, I want to say I have received about 4 weeks of Freshly meals without a hitch. Having tried a couple of other pre-made meal delivery plans (e.g. trifecta) I found Freshly's meal quality and consistency to be head and shoulders above the rest, so I stuck with it. The meat is moist/tender, unlike others such as Trifecta (very dried out and tough beef and chicken became a chore to eat). I don't understand why some are complaining about one dish or another in reviews however - You're never going to be enjoy absolutely everything on a menu as diverse as this so I'd recommend anyone using the service tries multiple configurations - e.g. After experimenting with some dishes, I have finally been able to settle on a selection that myself and my wife really like and look forward to each week (hence the disappointment I'll get to in a moment), including the Beef Chili, Chicken Livorno and Spaghetti squash.  However, here is my BIG issue with Freshly and what happened this past week has me reconsidering my loyalty to the brand because I'm not sure I can trust them. In my instance (which seems to be what others have experienced), there is a lot of miscommunication going on and no stepping up to offer proper solutions. Here's the story...   Last Thursday I got the usual notification to say \"Good News, your meals have shipped and will be delivered tomorrow\". So Friday I expected them to land, as they have done in the past. No sign by 3pm (unusual for Fedex in my area) so I checked the tracking info to see it was still stuck on \"Label Created, Pending\", even though I'd got the email saying it'd already shipped. They must have their system set up that those emails go out as soon as a label is created, which is a tad naive and a poor choice (I work in the online marketing industry so am a bit more in tune with what is possible in this regard and they have it set up in a risky way that leads to this very type of issue).   Anyway, I left it for Friday as the delivery window does say delivery may occur up until 8pm. No sign though and then around 10pm I received an email saying \"Sorry there's been a delay but the good news is your meals will arrive tomorrow (Saturday) and will be as fresh as always\". Great I thought, 1 day isn't too bad and they've kept me in the loop which is nice of them. Turns out that this second automated email was another pre-emptive strike which shows the lack of sophistication with their service and distribution center, which is very concerning. By Saturday the tracking info still had not updated so I contacted Freshly support. When they went away to investigate it turned out there had been some mysterious 'issue' which I still do not know what it was (and which the rep could not explain, but promised it had been 'escalated to a manager'). Well, I've yet to hear anything from said distribution manager either (I think they hope this issue is just dealt with).   Next the rep said \"I've refunded the full order and attached a $10 credit to your next deliver\". Um, What about my meals for this entire week? \"Oh sorry, because we make everything fresh you're out of luck\" (basic gist). You will receive your next week's meals as normal. Well, my major issue with this is, you promised me a service, you should be going out of your way to deliver, whether it's creating the meals, getting leftover units (e.g. surely they don't make every single meal to order?) or in some other way ensuring you deliver on your promise. To leave a customer hanging is totally unacceptable, especially considering your market - e.g. busy professionals who rely on you as a company.  And here is my biggest problem with the service I've received. Convenience, taste and nutrition are key (and Freshly ticks all of those boxes). However, reliability and Customer service is even more important to create long-term business relationships. If I cannot rely on a service given my hectic business schedule, it's very unlikely I will continue the relationship with the business. The lack of info and, worse yet, positive confirmations which turned out to be lies (e.g. \"sorry we're delayed, but your item will be with you tomorrow\") leave me with a very bad taste in my mouth (pardon the pun, especially as I have nothing to eat this week lol).",

After the call we had to close issue by refunding. So my opinion: - more flexible schedules should be available - closer work with delivery service, as currently no clear view of what's going on (delivery is a black box for me and Freshly), it's better to integrate delivery in web site - $10 is quite high price for such meal as Downtown SF (expensive place) provides fresh food for the same price, and it's cooked right there without any deliveries",

They definitely give it 5 stars. Got my first order today and had my first meal. It was surprisingly good for a microwave steak, and very tender. The portion seemed quite large and I couldn't finish my veggies, though they were good. (Green beans were a bit crunchy for my personal taste but still very good.) The packaging was great, the meals were still ice cold even on my hot porch, and it feels so good to have 5 more days of healthy meals in my fridge for $39. And if my plans change I plan to pop a couple in some ziplock bags and freeze. The website was very easy and it was fun choosing my meals. Every time I asked my previously mentioned kiddos about one I got the same reply, \"oh that's one of my favorites!\".  Lol, apparently all meals are their favorites. I am an empty nester and have been eating just terribly lately. No energy to cook at all. Hopefully this will help me get back into a healthier lifestyle.

    "text": "I'm a very active person; I've been bodybuilding for ~8 years now and one of my biggest struggles is maintaining a clean, healthy diet while also getting enough calories.  I did a BUNCH of research on the competition; Fitzee, Sunfare, Factor 75 and a few others. The biggest issue I had was the shipping cost. I finally was about to give up then I finally just decided to google 'meal preparation service' and to my surprise Freshly popped right up, located in Scottsdale, AZ. I live in Phoenix, AZ so this was convenient! (shipping is very cheap or even free being in the same state)  I've been with them only two weeks and I'm beyond satisfied. The packaging is very well thought out. I am on the 12 meals a week plan and it come in a large box with several dry ice packets. Also knowing that the item is basically shipped/received a day later ensures that the food is fresh.  Now the food-- the biggest thing for me was quality and they say that their food is high quality, no processed ingredients or GMO, etc. What impressed me most was how good the food actually is! While they basically look like TV dinners, the quality is incredibly high; the vegetables are fresh and delicious and the food is good-- you can tell these are chef prepared and not mass produced. I can't say I've had better 'pre-prepared' food before. They are similar to Trader Joes 'quick meals,' but much better quality and likely healthier. For instance, I'm picky about pork chops, but am REALLY impressed with the quality of the pork chops w/ Mustard Sauce. The fact that you can get a nice tender pork chop from a refrigerated meal that you throw in the microwave shows they know what they're doing.  Being someone that tracks all food intake, it's very easy to go online and look up the nutritional value and catalog it; I know EXACTLY how much carbohydrates/protein/calories/fat I'm getting a day so losing weight as never been easier! (However one of my few complaints-- they don't have the nutrition information 'on' the package, you have to go online and look it up, sort of a bizarre inconvenience)   The price is fair; $129 for 12 meals which comes out to $10.75 a meal-- while this is a bit steep, certainly more than what it would cost to prepare my own food, it's a luxury I'm willing to pay for, not to mention it eliminates virtually all need to go shopping. The price is also comparable if I were to eat out for lunch and dinner every day. I was probably spending $100 a week on food regardless and this takes away ALL that work. I have a healthy lunch/dinner 6 days a week without lifting a finger! Freshly was also cheaper than any competitor I found and considering they ship out of the same state it was a no-brainer.  The ONLY other complaint is it doesn't seem like they vary their menu often. (mind you I've only been with them 2 weeks, maybe they switch it up every month) I also don't like mushrooms which eliminates about 4 or 5 dishes, so something to keep in mind if you're a picky eater like me. I however don't mind having the same 4-5 dishes a week, especially when they are good!",

    "text": "A+ for customer service.  Other meal delivery services take note.  Boxes arrive with six big pieces of styrofoam lining the cardboard shipping box and a couple of ice packs inside.  Much less wasteful than the Pilates-sized mats seen in other boxes.  You open the box to see stacks of TV dinner looking meals and heavy card stock explaining the program.  Onto the food.  It's on the healthier side, and they say that the ingredients are high quality, no processed anything, all that good stuff.  Preparation is very easy (just pop in the microwave for a couple minutes) and the food is well cooked, not soggy, definitely not in the same league as frozen TV dinners.  Not as tasty as a piece of chicken that you would bake in the oven, but I don't think anyone expects that.  Overall the meals are simple and portions are much smaller than their cook-at-home meal delivery service counterparts.  $11 per heat-up meal for one person is probably not in most people's budgets.  Trader Joe's refrigerated meals are about $8 each and contain about 3x the amount of food (and are tastier, but I bet they contain processed everything and much more fat).  I'll note that when I tried to double up on items they were replaced with other items.  I really wanted two chicken parms in one box since this is the dish that my husband and I fight over, but instead they sent another chicken dish.  When they run out of meals they will send a note saying \"we ran out of X so here's Y instead\" but they did not send a note explaining that we are not allowed to double up, so maybe this was a packing error?  I'll pass on you, Freshly, but I am astonished at some of your other reviews on Yelp and others' low opinion of you when doing a Google search.  You aren't bad, just not for me.",

Someone who doesn't want to shop and is cooking for one and doesn't want to go out to dinner all the time every night because that is either too expensive or has too many calories. Why it gets negative reviews. You only get a day after delivery to suspend delivery for the next time and likely those people are just bitter. Calling it a TV dinner is completely inaccurate. A TV dinner is Frozen. This is refrigerated and healthy. Still, at $10 a meal what you're paying for is time not spent cooking to have something healthy. That can be quite valuable for a young professional. And these are for one. Also, at between 5 to 600 calories depending upon your weight and size you could make this into two meals as I do. More calories and more expensive than Trader Joe's meals but also again the key is they are delivered right to your door and they give you a good bit of variety.",

    "text": "Edited: I changed my review from a three to a four. They contacted me and refunded me for the food I had to throw out which was very kind and I always appreciate a company that stands behind their products. A couple of months after leaving my first review, I missed the convenience and delicious food, so I signed back up. Unfortunately, my first delivery was marked as delivered by FedEx though it was not (not Freshly's fault and they were quick to rectify, just annoying in general). The second week came fine but again the timing doesn't work with having fresh meals through the week (see original review below), so I've been taking the meals and putting them in the freezer for times when I can't/don't have time to cook. I don't think it will end up working for regular lunches for me, but it is nice to have healthy, delicious meals handy when I need them. Overall, definitely worth a try and while I will likely go off and on subscription (you can also \"skip a week\" if you just need a week or two off), I am happy to have the option of a company that prepares delicious, quality food and offers excellent customer service.   Original: First of all, the food is spot on delicious. I am SO impressed with the quality, it is the perfect size, and great if you are watching calories (for example, a generous slice of meatloaf, cauliflower mash, and peas and onions lands at just 420 calories). Every single meal was tasty. And by tasty, I mean, could have been a takeout from a restaurant kind of tasty.The price is reasonable for what you get, and in the end I probably save money just by not eating out for lunch all the time and I KNOW I'm eating much healthier.  The downside? I want to use them for lunches at work but the delivery options just aren't good for this. For example, the shipment of six meals I received a couple of days ago, on Friday November 3, expire on Tuesday November 7, and there aren't any better delivery options. I just had to throw out three meals from last week because they had expired by several days and I couldn't get to them in time. That's thirty bucks down the drain. Unfortunately, I just had to cancel my subscription for this reason. Bummer, because I thought I had finally landed on a perfect solution for easy, delicious, healthy lunches.  If you decide you would like to try it out, I recommend the chicken livorno and the shepherd's pie. SO GOOD and my two favorites. The buffalo chicken is good but if you're like me and want a little more heat, be prepared to dress it up a bit with some Frank's hot sauce and while you're at it throw on some blue cheese crumbles. The meatloaf is also good when you're wanting a little comfort food without the calories.",

    "text": "My introductory order of 6 meals arrived Saturday... Sunday morn I had been charged for 6 more meals. I had time to try one meal, and it was bland.   My first mistake: Dont assume that something called 'Freshly' is local.  I didnt know they were going to cook it Wednesday, ship it on Thursday from Phx to SF to arrive on Saturday, to be eaten over the next 6 days. 'FRESH'?    My other mistake is having a busy week and 'missing' the warning email... I still can't find it, but it was supposed to give me the option of skipping a week. I thought the promo offer would allow me to try the food first, before I had to take measures to keep them from charging me for more. I was wrong again.    They refused to cancel or refund the second order. I have to pay $60 for 6 more wk-old airline meals to arrive next Saturday. I feel a little taken advantage of, scammed. I really wanted to try their food with a little time to decide if it was for me. A weeks worth of meals should be allowed to be eaten over the course of a week before a new charge applied.     Support said \"While I certainly understand your frustration, please understand that we prepare your food from fresh ingredients and take the time to cook them properly and with care. Our meals are perishable and require a strict production schedule that, if deviated from whenever someone wishes, would damage the integrity of the meals. This is why it is so critical to give ample time for changes or cancellations\".   Today is Monday, my meals are scheduled to ship Thursday. I suggested there was plenty of time to cancel and credit my card. They could keep their meals and have a satisfied customer. Satisfied customers are apparently not their priority. Had they cancelled, and refunded as I requested I might have better enjoyed the meals remaining in my fridge, and re-ordered at a later date. Now I have a sour taste in my mouth to go with the bland food.     I'm eating the Chicken Caponata while I write this so you can get a 'fresh' review. The broccoli has good texture, a hint of garlic flake (which looks a bit odd, like a hint of grated cheese), but is bland. The chicken is tender, not dry, the toasted almond coating is there, not sure it adds anything. The eggplant Caponata with raisins and capers is ok, but lacks a flavor punch that one would expect. I think all the flavors have melded and mellowed in shipping. I added salt to enhance the flavors and it did, quite well. However, at 640gm of sodium it's already on the high side and shouldn't need more.   Last night I had the Pecan pork, the pork also was tender, not dry, but the 'gravy' and pecan coating were insufficient and flavorless. The only real flavor in the meal was the raisins and cranberries with the green beans.   I don't have a 'refined' palate. I consider myself an average American. Though I live in a city with many excellent restaurants I eat and enjoy most everything, from street vendor fare to occasional 5star dining.   This experience left me disappointed with the food and the customer service.   If you like bland meals shipped long distance via FedEx, this service is for you, but I think you would do better with a local service.",

The subscription settings are wacky and confusing. 3. It's not a good value.  If you are curious to try it. Use a promo code otherwise you are without a doubt wasting your money. Also don't forget to PAUSE OR CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION. They don't give refunds.",

    "text": "Was pretty unsure after reading the reviews so figured I'd share my thoughts. I am someone who HATES cooking so I never do it.  Better than I expected actually. The pictures of the packaging don't make the food look too flattering but you can definitely tell it's good quality. Several levels above what you'd get at the frozen food isle, as you'd hope.  Shipping: You pick what meals you want about a week in advance (for example, if you choose delivery on Thursday, you have until the preceding Saturday at 5pm to change what you want). It's shipped via overnight fedex.  Packaging: The food is packed into one box with lots of insulation and 2-3 giant ice packs depending on how many meals you get.   Reheating: Each meal has a specific microwave time listed, which I've found to be perfectly accurate (though my microwave does match the 1100 watt spec on the boxes).  I was surprised that the meals come out of the microwave pretty much at the perfect temperature, with no cold parts, and nothing burning hot either. I rarely even have to let it sit before eating. The food does appear to be cooked ahead of time, so it's not like you're cooking it from raw.  Expiration Time: All meals seem to have an expiration date about 6 days from the delivery date. For example, one set was delivered on Tuesday and the food was use-by the next Monday. Another set delivered on Thursday was use-by Tuesday. This suggests they make the food almost daily, because it doesn't really matter what day you get it delivered.  They do note that you can freeze the meals to keep them longer, then add an extra minute when reheating them.  Meal Choice: There's about 30 different meals to choose from at the moment. 5 of these are breakfast specific. They've also got vegetarian-only meals and let you filter by different ingredients like dairy, pork, etc. It's a pretty good selection in my opinion.  Conclusion: Worth trying out.",

The other reason for the star is that since my initial review I did have one meal that I liked a lot and that was the baked vegetable penne.  I'm looking forward to trying the dishes that are arriving soon and will update further on those taste-wise.  I want to add that I have a lot of dietary restrictions which make my choices on Freshly quite limited.  To those with less restrictions, there are many more meals to try and my guess is a higher chance of finding meals to fit your tastes!",

On 1/09 Noticed I got a shipped notification and sent to track it. I further noticed it said not picked up from sender yet. I called Freshly and spoke to a rep who made excuses about things being delayed because of them opening a new kitchen in MD. She said delayes were up to 1-2 days. She offered me a 20.00 credit and I said not good enough! She then made it 50% off my next order. I called back later that night to get a status update and a rep told me that it was in possession with the the delivery service and I would receive it tomorrow (she confirmed this while putting me on hold to gain further insight.) She also mentioned that delivery window would be most of the  day and I mentioned after 5pm that anyone accessing  my secure building will need a fob to gain entry to my condo otherwise they will need to call me. She then mentioned that the  delivery service has no way of calling. So I could be home all day and never get my meals and they would just have to be thrown out and I would never receive them? WTF!!!! Real professional shipping service Freshly is using in the east coast!!(60 hrs is max shipping time per Freshly!) So I reach out to the delivery company coordinating a window for today (since I was told last night that the \"delivery service has the package.\" The delivery service emailed me back today and said \"we can't help you because we don't have your package.\" I talked to a 3rd Freshly rep today and they tell me I'm not getting my meals because of a distribution problem. I'm confused I was told previous night that LaserShip had my package? He said that was inaccurate..and the fact I travel for a living and am leaving on Sunday the 13th I will not be able to get my meals now! Total BS!! I'm afraid to taste them now because if they taste anything like their incompetent customer service I'll probably need my stomach pumped!!!",

Original review:  I liked Freshly for a few weeks, but ended up canceling due to bad customer service.   Pros: -Very convenient for when I don't have time to cook -Healthier than a frozen meal from the grocery store -Some of the meals were decent (Steak Peppercorn and Sweet & Sour Chicken were my favorites)  Cons -Most of the meals I tried were just okay -Price seems pretty high at $10/meal -Portion size is MUCH smaller than pictured on the website. Fine for me, but not enough food for my husband.  Customer service was really terrible and ultimately what made me cancel. I had updated my account to skip a few weeks since I'll be out of town, but it turns out this didn't save to my account so they sent me another box and charged me. When I reached out they said there was nothing they could do.",

You get to pick each meal that is delivered to you and can cancel, skip, and go back to your subscription any time you'd like. They almost ALWAYS have a deal going on where you get 20 dollars off your purchase. At 40 dollars for 6 meals you're paying around 6.50 for a complete and satisfying meal. I love that my food is always fresh and I know I'm eating healthy. My body hasn't had any negative reactions to the food and I always feel good after every meal. I LOVE their meatballs with spaghetti squash and the buffalo chicken with loaded cauliflower. Thanks Freshly!",

They care little about the fact that people rely on their meals to arrive every week. Rather than rescheduling your delivery date, they opt to just cancel your delivery for holiday weeks like July 4th and Thanksgiving, etc. I would certainly look elsewhere is weekly meals are a necessity for you. Sure, they give you advanced notice which necessitates that you log onto their website for said notification -  God forbid that you be too busy to stay in constant contact. Then, they send you an email that arrives too late to reschedule your delivery date. Nice move guys!! I SUGGEST YOU TRY SOMEONE ELSE FOR DEPENDABLE, RELIABLE SERVICE.",

I responded to a Face Book ad the try their service out for half what they normally charge for 6 meals, so I agreed to do this.  Turns out that it is NOT just a trial program, although the ad on FB implied that that was the offer, it is a service program that you sign up for.  So they billed me for the second week of the delivery service even BEFORE the first weeks meal was delivered. But did not send me that receipt until AFTER they had billed, and would not let me recoup as, they claim, the food has already been ordered and the charge had already gone onto my credit card.    So maybe this is good for people who don't want to think about cooking or the quality of their food, but the food we tried was marginal at best.",

It is a glorified TV dinner that tastes, just ok. And, no matter what, there is common flavor across the board that is part of prepared meals, I can't describe it except to say, it's that \"prepared meal\" taste.  My biggest issue is that the amount of sodium is high. 700 to 1040 mg.  In this day and age it is not difficult to make a simple, good, fresh meal in little time. Let's cook.",

I say \"would be\", because after I received a notification 2 days ago telling me my meals had shipped, late last night I received another email telling me I would actually NOT be receiving any meals this week. So apparently, even though I received a tracking number, they actually had not shipped anything. Seems deceptive to me, and the response I got to my email expressing my confusion around this was a canned, \"we take delivery issues very seriously...\" type of response. NOT helpful. Additionally, I never received my first week's delivery either due to \"shipping problems\" (which I was not informed of until late Saturday afternoon, when it was no longer possible for me to go grocery shopping that day). So I've been a member for 3 weeks and have only gotten to try one week's worth of meals.   The meals are good, and convenient. A few of them are a bit too big for a single serving, in my opinion, but I can always split one meal into 2. But these delivery issues may cause me to find another service, because I can't suddenly make plans on Friday night for grocery shopping on Saturday. I want a meal service that is consistent and reliable, and so far, Freshly is not that service.   They get 3 stars for the quality of the food, not for the delivery service.",

The meals are quite tasty.  I've been getting six meals a week for about six weeks now, and there's only two I wouldn't order again (although I still finished them.  They weren't inedible.  Those were the southwest chicken bowl and the steak peppercorn.)  They heat well and are surprisingly fresh tasting.  When they're delivered, I usually have five days (including the day of delivery) to eat them.  I order two vegetarian meals a week, and I've noticed they often have sooner expiration dates.  I'm guessing the vegetarian stuff isn't as popular which is a shame.  I wish they offered more vegetarian stuff.  Tofu and tempeh reheat so easily!    I was prompted to finally write a review because I had a problem for the first time with my last delivery.  The meal had passed it's \"use by\" date.  I used the in app chat feature to lodge my complaint, and they immediately issued a refund of twice the meal's value.  So super duper easy to resolve.  I wish all companies had an app like this.  So much easier than making phone calls or waiting for return emails.  In all, I'm very happy with this service.  Pros: The food comes on time, it's tasty, it lasts a reasonable amount of time, I think there's a lot of overall variety, reasonable portion sizes (more than frozen meal for sure though less than a restaurant entree) customer service is good, and I think the price is reasonable for what you get.  Cons: Few vegetarian options and lots of packaging which just gets trashed.  Of course this last point would be True of any food delivery service.",

    "text": "I'm definitely a fan. When I know I'm going to have a busy week or I just don't want to cook for a while (it's not something I enjoy), I order 6 meals for the week.   Taste: The meals are good for what you're getting. And what are you getting? A pre-packaged meal. Yes, yes, they're made fresh and all that, but if you're trying to make them last the week, you'll have to freeze at least some of them. For that reason, it'll never taste like a meal that you had just cooked yourself piping hot or ordered in a restaurant. But don't be disappointed, this is definitely not lean cuisine*. I genuinely enjoyed the taste and flavor of some of the meals and those are the ones I order again. The portion size is also really good (unlike lean cuisine*) and I say that as a bigger girl who likes to eat a lot. Basically, for a pre-prepared non-restaurant meal that you didn't buy frozen from the grocery store, this is as good as it gets.   *Despite the shade, I usually have lean cuisine for lunch.   Convenience: I come home from a 10 hour work day, and I'm exhausted. I used every ounce of my will power not to stop by Taco Bell because I'm trying to pretend I'm better than that. I pop the freshly meal into the microwave for a few minutes and I don't bother to plate it because nobody loves washing the dishes. Done. It's that easy. The packaging IS annoying, though. So much for helping the earth...  Health: Look, it depends on what kind of person you are. If you're kind of a piece of crap (like me) who eats a lot of fast/fast casual food or makes huge bowls of pasta or potatoes at home, this is great. I'm always the worst at dinner and these meals are usually healthier than whatever I end up making. In fact, I use the meals on the lower end of the calorie count for weight loss. However, if you're actually a pretty healthy person, these aren't the best. Some of the meals have a lot of sodium and they could probably go a little easier on the carbs. But look at the menu for yourselves.   Price: It's okay, not great. I do the 6 meals a week plan for $60. It doesn't break the budget but there's no doubt it's cheaper to cook at home. But like.... the convenience, though.... If you take too long of a break between weeks, they send out $20 off coupon so that's pretty cool.  Overall, I recommend.",

    "text": "This is a long one...  I know that a referral and a good review is the best way to thank someone in the customer service industry. I know how much a good review means, especially after being threatened at work by the same lady multiple times that I HAD to give her a refund for the mistake she ordered on her sandwich or she would just \"write a terrible review\" about us.  I'd heard about Freshly for months on Michael Rosenbaum's podcast, and when I finally landed a job that paid more money I was really excited to try it. Well, I tried it and I LOVE IT (I'm literally eating their \"Thanksgiving Turkey with Quinoa Stuffing\" as I write this. Okay, now to the part that compelled me to refer Freshly to you...  After work today, I realized my payment for this week's meals didn't go through. I checked my bank account. No wonder, rent drained it. I thought I'd made enough in tips today to pay it but it was a slow day and I was a few bucks short. So I got onto Freshly live chat to see if maybe I could push the delivery date back a few days or split the payment onto two cards (p.s. I know it sounds like this must be a giant payment but it was only $59. My rent is just a lot and I really didn't make great tips today.). Live chat responded immediately with a lovely human being ready to help. The best part was that this chat was totally unscripted unlike other live chats.  While we were trying to figure out options for how to make the delivery work for me this week, I explained how much I was enjoying Freshly: How much I love the food; how I love not having to cook or swing by McDonalds when I get home so late from work that it's the only thing open; how much I love not spending up to $100 a week on crap fast food and groceries that I'm not even eating; how much I love that the food isn't even frozen, I just have to keep it in my fridge and heat it up for a couple minutes in the microwave; how much I love that none of their food has gluten, and you can let them know your dietary preferences; etc, etc, etc.  We talked about how I was embarrassed that I couldn't afford it after rent and a bad day at work. The lady (who I found out later was also named Jamie!!!) was awesome! She said she felt like I was describing her life and not to be embarrassed about rent. After chatting about this stuff for a bit, she told me she had great news! She was able to get me an in-store credit for this week's food. Completely on the house, just because I loved Freshly so much and they want me to continue having the best experience possible with them. I pretty much cried with gratitude..  I want Freshly to know how much it meant to me that they cared enough about me as a customer to help me out this week. I want them to know how big of a difference it makes to my bank account by getting that in-store credit for the week. It was the best customer service experience of my life. Imagine a world where all companies rewarded your love of their product instead of giving you free stuff because they are afraid you'll leave a bad yelp review. THANK YOU, Jamie, and THANK YOU, Freshly for your incredible food, service, and genuine kindness and generosity.  Give em' a try guys! And DEFINITELY try the \"Chicken Risotto\" and the \"Shrimp and Andouille Paella\".  Update: Just finished licking the plate. It's that good.",

    "text": "Kinda hooked on this stuff. I know it's not the cheapest without the discount codes, but it fits my lifestyle so well. I won't waste food, don't have time to cook, and track my nutrient intake. Freshly is a great option for someone like me, and the food has been so much better than I expected.   The meats have been cooked very carefully, and I was actually pretty blown away by the pork chop. I also loved the beef lasagna, bbq pulled pork (the squash cakes on the side are fantastic), chilis, and cod cakes. I froze some of the meals before eating and didn't notice any change in quality. At this point I've tried 24 different meals and there are only a few I wouldn't order again (not a huge fan of the egg or sausage dishes). I also completely forget that it's a gluten-free menu.   At one point I had some confusion with discount codes but the customer service team was very responsive, pleasant, and helpful.  It's hard trying to sound like a genuine advocate and not just a referral pusher but Freshly has truly been a game changer for me.",

    "text": "I got snagged by the Facebook promo '6 meals for $30', figured I'd try it out - worse case I would be out $30.  I'd probably recover.   Placed my 6 meal order, paid, etc.  I knew this was one of those automatic subscription sites, so I immediately went to cancel the subscription (so I'd just get the 6 meals and see if they were any good).  Turns out, you can't just immediately unsubscribe, you have to wait until the first delivery. If you cancel immediately , it cancels your first order and refunds your money.    As their support explained, it would be best to 'skip the upcoming weeks', then cancel. So they're betting that people will forget and let the deliveries continue. Really annoying. But it probably makes them money, at least in the short term.  So onto the food - And that's actually the bright spot here - almost everything I had was pretty good. However, I wish there was a 'less paleo' option, because mashed cauliflower is not a substitute for mashed potatoes, and 'veggie pasta' is not a substitute for pasta.  Not everyone is on a paleo/keto kick...I workout so I can eat decent food, and mashed cauliflower is terrible, I don't care what you put on it.   So, because of the forced paleo options and partially because of the price, I ended up canceling. The annoying 'gotcha' subscription model aside, this program would be good for someone who is watching their carbs. Just not me.  Three stars instead of two because the stuff I could eat was good.",

    "text": "My overall experience dealing with Freshly is 4 stars. Signing up and choosing my initial meals was quite easy. The steak peppercorn meal was definitely our favorite. For our second delivery, we missed the selection time but was accommodated on changing our order later that night without hassle or questions. Deliveries were never later than Monday night as promised to us.   The only real issues we had with the meals was that we were never completely satisfied with an entire meal. My wife and I would like one part of the meal but then we wouldn't eat the other.   I'd say overall, if you aren't a terribly picky eater, this is a great option for people who do not like to cook or don't have time.   We canceled with ZERO HASSLE from our online chat rep. They refunded and canceled our upcoming order with a smile. Other food delivery services would have fought you tooth and nail and continued to send deliveries and charging your card until you threatened to sue them.

I placed an order several weeks ago as I planned on testing multiple meal delivery services with my family (part of a more free time, eat healthier New Year's Resolution). The first week was scheduled to arrive today, but instead I received an email stating: \"...we experienced an unexpected delay in cooking some meals and will be unable to deliver your order for this week.\"  While I understand that businesses do experience an occasional issue with their supply chain, it seems to me they would have known prior to the day the food was to arrive that it was not coming.   It's very disappointing that Freshly elected to inform me the day of, especially as it is now Monday and I generally am not able to do the shopping during the week because of my work schedule.    I won't be giving them another chance as my first (and only) experience with them was so disappointing.",

I tried to point out that that is the definition of not having service in my area, which is the 8th largest city in the US by the way so I am not just some angry person in the middle of nowhere, but they claim that they do service my area, just they don't.

    "text": "Great idea for a meal delivery service. The con to these meals vs ones you prepare yourself is that there's no transparency on how they're made. This was great postpartum because who has the energy to cook? However, I noticed black specks in one of the dishes like it was from the coating of the skillet they used to prepared it. I picked through it and made a mental note of it and still ordered more. Last night, however, after consuming the baked vegetable penne dish, I got violently ill and have not been able to keep anything down all day. I called and reported this and all they've done is refund the meal. I'm too sick and weak to go to work and they also can't provide me with any information on health inspections or tell me whether or not they will be following up with me once this is investigated. If you order proceed with caution.  In response to the comment below, I now have a fever. I am a working new mom who doesn't have time to be ill! On top of that I'm nursing. Refunding my meals is NOTHING compared to taking sick days and endangering my child's health! As a former Food and Beverage Manager, I want to see something IN WRITING (not produced by your company) that speaks to the cleanliness of where the food is prepared. A comment made by you on Yelp in response to a bad review is not sufficient.",

Now I can have an amazingly fresh and healthy meal first thing in the morning, and then another great meal at lunch, all with no effort on my part? That's a game changer.  No stopping work to run and get take-out. No late nights out grocery shopping or meal prepping. Seriously, it's improved every other facet of my life by freeing up precious time while also ensuring my nutrition is healthy. Oh, and they taste terrific, just a small bonus right there :)  But seriously, it's worth every penny. They honestly taste amazing, they show up on time, and they haven't made a mistake in over a year of having them. Plus, they keep things fresh (heh;) by constantly changing up the menu.

    "text": "While I like the food and it is great if you have Celiac disease, the shipping services they use in Northern California are terrible. They get a 1-star review on YELP, why on Earth would you ever use them to deliver food is beyond me. My only conclusion is that they are probably dirt cheap, but like the old sang goes, you get what you pay for and in this case, you get pissed off customers, spoiled food, missed or late deliveries, and bad Yelp Reviews.  The food rarely arrives on the day it is supposed to arrive per the commitment between Freshly and the delivery service as stated on the website of the delivery company when looking at the tracking information.   We originally used Freshly last year, but decided to cancel since our food never came when it was supposed. There are a number of occasions when the food arrived so late that it was warm. Instead, of making sure that the deliveries actually arrive on time for their customers, I'm the one who has to contact the 3rd party delivery service to see where the meals are, how they have \"magically\" gone missing, how they are on some truck and will not make the delivery window etc.   Whenever we contact Freshly about our deliveries, we just get the run around. Seriously?! I'm paying close to $100 a week and now I have to be responsible for your shipping inadequacies in addition to doing my normal day job. We decided to give Freshly another chance this year, but the same issues are starting to creep up again and this situation isn't unique to just us. Our friend also experiences the same issues and had to change his delivery day because his food never arrived on time thus most of the food was spoiled. So now, we have changed our delivery day and I truly hope this works out because this is a great service, but if we continue to experience the same delivery issues over and over again and   I'm constantly calling On Trac to find out what happened to our food which then is spoiled by the time it reaches us or never reaches us, then we are just going to cancel again. We base our weekly meal plans around the delivery, so if no food arrives or if it arrives spoiled then we have to make alternative arrangements at the last minute, which is not easy if one of those people has severe Celiac Disease. Get your delivery services together for the love of G-D.",

They have so many meals to choose from, which I love because I get bored of eating the same thing every day like with standard meal prepping. All their meals are AMAZING! I honestly haven't found one I don't like. I'm not very picky, but still. That is huge!   They are a great deal! I get the 9 meal plan so I have lunch and dinner for the week (while my kitchen is under construction). These meals are only $10 a piece! Which is VERY cheap for meal delivery! That's the same as going out or somewhere fast! This is the cheapest delivery I have found with so many options and such good quality.  Ordering and reordering is super easy! Their app makes it simple and reminds you to finalize your meal selections. Also, the app connects to my health app on my iPhone so all the nutritional info is tracked for me!  Their customer service team is the best! I changed the day I wanted my meals to be delivered on and this caused some sort of glitch to happen where I was receiving twice the amount of meals in one week. I couldn't figure out how to cancel one delivery because I was nervous it would cancel both since it was obviously a mistake. So I contacted customer service. They were able to cancel one of the orders (even though it was past the cancel deadline) and they credited me $80 towards my next order! I was shocked! It was so unexpected but a very nice gesture that actually made me write this review.   So definitely go with this service if you're considering one! I am VERY happy ever since I found Freshly!",

    "text": "Freshly is a great service for busy people looking to eat healthy without spending time to prep. I have been using them for several months now. I have only had one delivery mistake which they rectified immediately by giving me $20 off my next order. The food tastes as good as expected for a meal delivery service. I think the reviews that are saying the food is subpar are people with unrealistic expectations. Food you reheat in the microwave will never taste like a 5 star restaurant or good home cooked meal no matter where you get it from. Overall they are reliable, convenient, use pretty good ingredients although some room for improvement, especially where sodium and lower carb options are concerned, and their packaging is pretty eco friendly considering. I am going to be trying another company because I am looking for more lower carb and dairy free options, but I have been overall pleased with Freshly and would try them again.",

I've never experienced problems with HelloFresh, Daily Harvest, etc.  You'd think they'd especially invest in their new customers, but... nope.  Major bummer and last minute shopping needed now.  #worklifefail  Update:  Freshly social media contacted me promptly after my above review.  Professional, apologetic, and offered to make it right. I decided to give it a second attempt. A few days ago I received the \"your order is on the way\" confirmation. Alas, this morning I received the \"We're so sorry we can't deliver this week\" and another offer for a $20 discount on a future order.  Two weeks, two fails, poor coordination of communications (exception being social media).  Awful.",

I've tried quite a few meal subscription plans and opted to try Freshly to save time without suffering the quality of taste... but found that the food was super bland and comparable to cafeteria food. For example, we tried the Steak Peppercorn with \"Sauteed\" Carrots and Green Beans... and the steak came out dry and well-done, while the veggies tasted like it came out of a can (very soggy in texture and no salt, pepper or flavoring at all).   I had high hopes for Freshly and don't believe it's worth the price. The so-called \"chef-cooked\" meals are just glorified TV dinners.",

The best of the three was definitely pork carnitas. It was filling and had great flavor. The shrimp scampi had too much liquid, although the flavor wasn't bad. The beef stew had no liquid...so not really a \"stew.\"  The main issue I have was that I only had 3 days to eat the 6 items before it expired. So for those who say they got about a week expiration date, they probably get deliveries on Wednesdays (I had mine delivered on Friday).  I'm not going to be continuing this subscription. The full price is not worth it for me. I can see how this service can be useful to some, especially for the convenience...just can't imagine myself microwaving my meals on a consistent basis (I do love to cook).",

Convenience, definitely better quality than a typical TV dinner, and decent enough variety.   However, the ordering became cumbersome, I couldn't always eat the meals by the expiration dates 4 days after delivery of 6 meals, and after becoming sick for the third time, I know I can point it directly to this food. Once I got hit with an allergic reaction just an hour after consuming a meal, and twice they sent me running to the bathroom just a few minutes after eating. There is nothing in the ingredients list that should make my stomach upset, and I don't have any known food allergies, so I'm unsure what would trigger any type of reaction, but for $60/week, I can buy something else pretty easy to whip up at home that I know won't make me feel terrible.   I wanted to like the system, but each time I got ill, it was from a different type of meal, and it was also the only thing I ate that day. I'm sure of the cause, but I also can't attribute it to one specific food item. So unfortunately, good idea in theory, I just can't play the guessing game.",

I am not sure how they made food taste so bland, I mean I cook with the same ingredients and certain things like butternut squash actually has a taste, theirs had no taste...  this mystifies me. Everything aside, this is food, no matter how convenient it is, if it doesn't taste good then what is the point? Ingredients are mostly pre-made quality like buying a huge bag of Tyson frozen pre-cooked chicken breast complete with fake grill marks. Is it edible, yes, but when a lean cuisine tastes better at 1/3 the cost (though amount of food is smaller in lean cuisine) then I don't see the benefit of a meal that costs about the same (when full price) or more then most take out meals and the take out meal tastes good.",

CONS:  Meals are not always tasty; limited variety that becomes monotonous week after week; only a small step above the frozen TV dinners you get from a grocery store.  With a name like \"Freshly\" you get the image in your head of freshly made meals delivered right to your door.  However, these are still frozen dinners that you have to microwave, which is not my idea of fresh food.  Some of the meals are great, but not all.  After only 2 weeks, I realized this was just not for me and that I'd much prefer truly fresh (and not frozen) meals that were cooked (and not microwaved).    If you live a busy lifestyle with no time to make your own food, this might be a great option for you.  Or, you can go to the grocery store and buy (almost) the same frozen dinners at half the cost.  Otherwise, you can simply cook your own food to assure it's healthy, fresh, and delicious.",

I thought it might be a good option for my family since one kid is vegetarian and the rest of us are not so it would allow us to order specific meals for each family member instead of cooking one meal for the family but all of the food we tried ended up being bland and mushy.  Not only was the taste bland but the texture of the food and the look of it too.  Not impressed.  We will go back to Home Chef and take the time to cook our meals in order to get food that taste good and looks appealing.",

Delivers with taste, nutrition as well as portion control. And you seriously can not beat the convenience. Yah, I've read reviews complaining about the price tag but 12 meals with free shipping that you don't have to cook or mess with for $107? Come on guys, you pay for the luxury of not having to order food or meal prep and go to the grocery store. My job is demanding and some days I don't even get but maybe a few minutes to eat. This service is wonderful. The only thing that I think would make it better is if the menu would change a bit more or had a larger expansion of choices. I don't really mess with the breakfasts as I find they are a bit bland. Also love the suggestions on the sleeves for those who appreciate a bit more spice or flare to the dish.",

I have no idea what some of these other peoples expectations could have been at around $10 a meal made fresh delivered to your door. Some of the meals could use a little salt and pepper is my greatest critique. All of their packing material is recyclable with recycling or reuse instructions printed on them. I am even saving the denim insulation packages to insulate my garage!!",

    "text": "If I could give them negative stars I certainly would!  I was so excited to sign up for a healthy- food delivery service for my family's busy weekdays but I haven't even received my first delivery yet and I'm already disappointed!  After seeing their ad on Facebook, I went to their website and everything looked amazing so I proceeded to sign up.  The default delivery date showed this Friday and I discovered I was unable to change the delivery date to next week (as I know I will be out of town this weekend for Easter).  On this same screen it states, \"You can change the day later,\"  so I went on through the purchasing process.  I selected the $129 plan for 12 meals a week which I felt was worth it considering the time I would save during the week.  After completing my order I could not find anywhere that would let me change the date.  I searched all over the site and the Help section with no luck so I emailed customer service with my concerns immediately after placing the order.  Their reply was absolutely shocking.  Shocking because it's 2016 and Customer Service is key to the success of any business and Freshly could care less if they address my issue.  They basically told me that the order was already processed and suggested that I donate the food or give it to a friend if I don't want it.  I never said I did not want the delivery, it just needs to come next week because I will be out of town Fri-Sun so no one would be there to receive the order.    I cannot wrap my mind around how they believe this is an acceptable reply to my email.  I'm a brand new customer that expressed my concerns about the delivery date 4 days prior to delivery and literally as soon as I placed the order.",

Horrible customer service. Only after the money with extreme disregard to their customers.  I would definitely not recommend Freshly to anyone.  When a company decides that it is ok to ship perishable food to an empty house, despite me giving notice that I want to cancel the order if the week, 5 min after the deadline on Friday for a wednesday delivery, it just speaks loud to their extreme greed and unprofessionalism.",

Missed the skip deadline by just a few hours, wrote them right away (same day of deadline) and they told me they couldn't help me. Right! Somehow I doubt they were cooking my meals between when I wrote them and when they responded. It's clear my food hadn't been prepared yet or shipped. Money-grubbing. No sense of accommodation. Cancelled immediately afterward.  Would not recommend this service.  I'm sure they'll respond to this justifying their practice as they have with all the other reviews -- Your copied and pasted response is not going to change my mind about my experience.",

I called them for refund and told me it's too late cuz they only have a 7 day window in their policy.  I even asked to at least send me the meals I paid for and consider this an exception to their policy (which  a lot of businesses do for customer satisfaction).  In the end, the supervisor could only give me 50% off credit from the regular price.  My card was charged $39 which was a first time special price, and the current regular price is $60.  You do the math.  It's too bad.  Both the customer rep and her supervisor were very nice to me though but their policy failed me.  Businesses should be better than this to their customers.",

I recently received an e mail offering a discount. So I gave Freshly another opportunity, in the hopes that their shipping and food quality had improved. But by accepting the 'special', I also re-activated my old subscription with knowing I had. There was no indication of what was about to happen. I received shipping notices that my meals were on their way, but no listing of what was shipped. What I received was two packages containing 12 meals. 6 from my order and another 6 from my old subscription that had been reactivated without my knowledge or request. This company has problems. I have cancelled my subscription yet again. My first impression was correct. Be careful when you order and don't expect them to correct their errors.",

Overall the food was good tasting.  The steak did taste good as well as several other dishes.  There wasn't anything that was bad tasting so they're doing a good job on making their meals taste good.      Original review:  I really was hoping this would be a great experience but unfortunately it is not.  I just received my order today for the first time and the portion sizes are A LOT smaller than the portion sizes on their website.  When I called Freshly customer service, the guy said that it's not posted on their website but he said portion sizes vary because they outsource from several different places, and that they go by weight.  The problem is if they go by total weight, they can add more potatoes and beans and less steak and claim it's the same weight, even though their picture on the website shows different proportions.  A couple examples out of the 9 meals I ordered are the meatloaf and the steak.  Both portions were 1/3 the size of the website picture.  What I got even when you hold a fork up to the tray to compare scale like the website has a fork to compare scale.  I am highly disappointed and cancelled my service with the customer service rep only 10 minutes after opening the box, even before I tried a single meal.  I wish I could just send the 9 meals back as I feel it's False advertising and they don't state on their website that portion sizes vary.   You will only find that out if you call customer service.  I feel cheated, like this is False advertising not disclosing that to new customers.  Like I said, I sincerely want to just send the 9 meals back to them unopened and ask for a refund.  I'm very disappointed.",
