The  Margaritas were flavorful (not too strong) and the wait staff was super-friendly.  We ordered the nachos for the table and I tried a burrito along with some of a fish taco and some traditional beans.  Nothing super fancy on the menu - just wholesome, authentic Mexican food.  Be sure to check out the \"blue room\" when you enter into the dining rooms... neat architecture!",

We decided to stay and try out the food, even the the table was messy and the menus were greasy. All of which should have been warning signs of what was to come. What we received should not be called Mexican food. We had hot plates but cold rice and lukewarm food. When we informed our waitress of the issue she stated she would get us more rice which she did. However she didn't take the plate back, she provided us a plate to put the cold rice AFTER we had asked for the plate in which to do that. I personally ordered the Carne with an Enchilada and it was the WORSE enchilada I've ever had. I've made better ones using canned chile. The steak tasted like rubber and was very chewy. There was 0 consistency with the food seeing as though 3 people ordered the same meal and none looked or tasted the same. I live in Phx now and i was hoping to show my family a decent spot for some Mexican food. I was extremely disappointed in this place and will never go to it again nor will I recommend it. If you're thinking of coming here just go to chipotle or even Taco Bell, it will be cleaner and the food will be done with pride.",

I like the North Scottsdale location a little more because it's more open and less stuffy. Lunch specials are a good deal.   I've tried a few items, but I generally get the beef tacos. The taco comes out really hot because it's fried, the taco is a little drippy with grease, but it's quite good. They get a an extra kudos from me for carrying RC Cola on tap. This place is middle of the road Mexican and you'll feel a little bloated after you eat there, but still pretty good overall.",

Located very close to the Civic Centre, and near Old Town  it is easily accessible, even by foot from Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall. Here are some comments:  Good: excellent authentic Mexican food, very reasonable prices, generous-sized portions, friendly service, parking lot in the back, lots of street parking  So-so: the place could use a coat of paint, but the food makes everything better  The chips here come with 2 bottles of different flavoured salsa which is a nice touch. I especially enjoyed the flautas and guacamole.  This is a highly recommended restaurant that offers excellent real Mexican nosh at reasonable prices. We'll be back next time we're in town.  A shout out to our server Daniel for great service!",

I think people want to truly love this place because its a landmark and has been around for so long, but honestly - it's just plain bad.  Beans with the dried crusting edges, watered down salsa, cheese crisp that you have to mop the oil off of, enchilada sauce congealing with the oil slick sheen on top and meat with fat globs clumped into it.  Seriously, if you are even considering mexican food - avoid this place.  I am truly baffled by the amount of 4 and 5 stars for this place....",

My first bite was filled with chicken, cheese, and steel wool. I swallowed part of this and it scratched my throat on the way down which made me realize something was wrong. The waiter apologized and took my food away and sent the manager over. He also apologized and said they'd take my meal off the bill. 10 mins later I was asked if I wanted anything else to eat. I ate one bite of my food and you think I'm not still hungry?!? What place doesn't automatically make more food when they screw up?!? This wasn't the end of the situation. I was stopped by the manager when I came out of the bathroom. He apologized again and told me this happens sometimes because it's the only thing that cleans the pans. WTF?!? You serve steel wool sometimes because it gets your pans cleaned? I don't get it..... Great if it cleans the pans, but what the hell was it doing in my burrito?!? And it's happened before.....don't you think you have a problem here?  Never again will I be eating here again, and never again will the rest of my group be eating there again. Don't waist your time, they feed non food items sometimes and they think that's ok",

I ordered a regular margarita on the rocks, some bean dip, and the carne asada burrito.  The salsa they put on the table with the chips was outstanding.  (I assume they make it in house).  My margarita was meh, ok.  I am not a fan of super sweet and it was on the sweet side.  I am assuming they use a mix there, and not fresh lime juice :( I didn't care for the bean dip.. the carne asada burrito was delicious, just needed more meat in my opinion.  The ratio of tortilla to meat was up there.  We also ordered sopapillas for dessert at the end of the meal.  I was NOT a fan.  The cinnamon and sugar were half assed sprinkled on there and not coated completely.  Tasted like a bland donut... save for the honey packets they served us.  Honey PACKETS?? lol.  Overall it was meh.  I gave it 4 stars though cause our server was really nice :)",

They give you two different types of salsa with your chips & the salsa is incredibly fresh. I got the a la carte chicken empanada, fish taco & green corn tamale. I really enjoyed the juicy & natural flavors of the chicken... I've never had chicken empanada this good before. The green sauce on top was just enough to add some flavor without overpowering the dish. I got the fish taco on a soft tortilla rather than a hard shell & it was really delicious. The tamale was what I would've expected out of a tamale... nothing too exciting about it but it was still good.  The place was very packed & since the restaurant is a little ways from the main road in Old Town I suspect that it was mostly locals in there (we were visiting from out of town). The restaurant was much larger on the inside than I expected so we got seated relatively quickly... and the host seemed like he had a blast working there! Service was good & we never felt rushed. I really miss this place.",

I told my server it was my first time in 10 years and she immediately said \"nothing has changed.\" Boy, was she right.  The food is a gloppy greasy gut grenade to begin with... The presentation is straight out of the 80's - huge portions of slop overcooked and swimming in an even more overcooked sea of diarrhea with some wilted iceberg lettuce plopped on top looking sad. It's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen referred to as food.   All the food here is pre-cooked... meaning it is just sitting there over heat waiting for you to order it. I know this because you can't order anything special, like \"no onions\" in your shredded beef. The chicken was dry and clearly had been sitting on heat for several hours. It was completely vile.   We had also ordered a cheese crisp with ground beef... that was the description. It said nothing about veggies on it, but there they were - some pathetic overcooked hunks of unidentifiable veg trapped in the tar pit of cheap rubbery cheese and grey meat-esque vomit. It was sickening...   The decor of this place is a leftover relic clearly designed over 30 years ago by someone who was heavily into psychotropic drugs and Disneyland. That went along with the food which looked like it belonged in a museum (as my girlfriend suggested). The lighting in the room they stuck us in wasn't helping - it cast a blue hue from the skylights onto everything on the table making the food look even less appetizing. Aside from that though, it's kinda kitschy in both a fun way and a pathetic way.   I basically refused to eat anything from the menu (though I tasted some of my girlfriend's dish and the cheese crisp) and stuck to chips and salsa. The chips are the freshest thing sold here and aren't bad. The salsa isn't so bad either. We split a margarita just to sample it and decided it wasn't bad, but you could tell they put cheap tequila in it - beware of subsequent headaches.   It's a shame the food is so shitty because this place is in a great location. I can only recommend it for grabbing drinks with that hot GILF you found at the Yarn Barn before you take her back to her retirement community to bang.",

I've been eating tums and chasing them with soda (to settle my stomach) as well as making several bathroom trips.  I have never been this sick from eating anywhere.  I think Taco Bell would have been far superior and they don't even serve real meat!      The chips and salsa were okay.  My bf and I split the cheese crisp with beef (first mistake).  The beef looked grey  and the cheese looked old and overcooked. My entree was the chicken burrito,  I think they use chicken in a can b/c the meat was so dry and shredded.  The waitress offered a sauce on top and good thing I accepted b/c otherwise I would have had to choke down the dry burro.    Gordon Ramsey needs to take over and revamp this place.  The location is prime but it seems like they were just being lazy all around.  I think they need to pare down the menu because there are too many choices and most of it is the same crap just re-worded.  Also, I kept seeing so many servers standing around shooting the shit.  If you don't have any tables you could be helping out in other ways.     This place really lacked warmth from the staff and I think it's important to make your customers feel welcome.

They, of course, loved this place.   YUM. That's what my family said. I asked them what I should say in my review. My dad loved Los Olivos and said he'd rate 'em 4.5 stars. He only deducted the 1/2 star because they took our chips away before we were finished with them. I guess it was a bartering system: your entrees for our chips.   Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing. After all, I didn't want to drown in grease, so I picked the shrimp entree that came with rice. I picked at the soggy rice. I nibbled on the burnt garlic toast. And the shrimp? Well, let's just say I wasn't expecting to have to work for my food. I had to peel the shell off myself. \"How do I do that?\" I asked horrified. Still a shrimp novice, I had no clue. \"You grab their little legs and pull.\" I nearly had to excuse myself to go throw up.",

As for the rest of the meal, the soup was broth and 2 carrots slices, no meat, and was the saltiest thing I've tasted in a long time. And oh boy were the fish tacos fishy smelling in not a good way. Opening the togo box I was immediately concerned for my health and after one bite I decided better to be safe than sorry and did not finish that bite or the rest of the tacos. All in all I paid $40 for $10 of edible food. 2 stars is generous for my experience.",

    "text": "Went to dinner with some friends, we were celebrating a friends presence , she had moved out of the valley almost 2 years ago, we were a party of 8.    This was my 1st time to Los Olivos and I was kind of excited to try them out. Unfortunately sometimes being me requires you to attend more than one party in a day, so I just came from another party where I had already filled up on some food, so I wasn't very hungry, but wanted to join my friends in the fun!  I was about ten minutes late, asked the hostess were my friends were seated at, and was told, oh just look around till you find them, we have a few parties here tonight.  I thought well isn't that nice I get to roam in a place I don't know very well. But turns out I didn't have to go far, I found them in the 2nd room.  I sat down, and was browsing the menu, our server came to me and said what are you drinking and looked a little perturbed that I joined this table. I just told her water. I wasn't the last one to the party, my other friend showed up 5 mins after me, and she got the same chilly attitude from the server. And with a big party like ours, it didn't really matter how bad the service was, because the tip was already added to our bill.   Everyone placed there order, I wound up ordering Deep Fried Ice Cream, since I was already a meal ahead of everyone. While waiting for our food, I was munching on the chips and salsa, now I'm not a fan of the salsas, the \"hotter\" one was way to seedy for me. I like hot salsa, but I don't like feeing like I'm eating sunflower seeds. And the mild salsa was like a pico de gallo minus any peppers and runny. I mixed the 2 together, and that didn't really help either, so eating chips and salsa wasn't working for me.  Now the deep fried ice cream that was perfect! The sweet taste of honey, the crispy outer shell and the cold ice cream made a perfect treat for this hot summer day!  I really wanted to like Los Olivos, maybe I'll go to the other location and give them another try.",

Extra staff kept drinks full and offered more chips when he saw we were low.  Salsa was delicious, my Husband and 3 boys loved the HOT salsa and I stuck with the regular salsa.  Both kinds were delicious and tasted fresh.  Veggie fajitas were yummy, huge serving as well.  Chimichanga, fish tacos and a chicken dish as well as chips and queso were enjoyed by all.  Good rice and beans, yummy tortillas.  Margarita was okay - not the best, not the worst but I could definitely tell I drank a margarita!  Giving 4 stars because chips after the first two baskets were extra and it's already kind of pricey.  We had a Groupon so it wasn't painful.  We would probably go back if we visited Scottsdale again.",

Upon arrival you may be greeted with a lengthy wait (approx 45 minutes or so for me).  When you finally get your table be prepared to wait for at least another 5-10 minutes for a server to come and get your drink order.  The first bowl of chips is free but each consecutive one will cost you (a nice $2.50 at the time of this review).  Order what you like but substitutions will also cost you.  Sadly this historic \"landmark\" in Scottsdale has deteriorated into another tourist attraction that serves up overpriced bland, and mediocre at best food.",

    "text": "Supposedly the oldest Mexican restaurant in the area, we were directed here by our concierge.  The place has a kitchy, almost 80's feel, but it needs some updating.   The menu is a bit too \"American\" for me; if you expect a truly authentic experience, this is not the place.  I think they get a lot of tourists here, who are used to the more Americanized dishes.    To start, the salsa is extremely tasty - very fresh - although the chips seemed \"bag\" quality.  After that, it was all downhill.  Two stars is a gift - it's closer to 1 star.  For lunch, we had the machaca - dry, shredded beef with peppers and tomatoes, and a combo plate of chile relleno and a corn tamale.  The plates look like a disaster when served; sauce everywhere, very disorganized.  The plates came out so hot they must have been microwaved - not a good sign at a respectable restaurant.  Too much sauce, also a sign of laziness and lack of attention to detail.  The rice was not great - not made fresh, and also crisp on top from the microwave (or taken from yesterday's rice pot).  The refried beans were a flavorless mash of canned beans; avoid.  The machaca shredded meat itself was somewhat flavorful, but again it appeared that they make it day(s) earlier and then re-heat it after slapping it on a plate.  Not authentic. The flour tortilla was huge and actually the best thing I tasted, other than the salsa.  Americanized, large plates of re-heated slop.  My advice - find a REAL Mexican restaurant, and stay away from this joint.",

Old Town doesn't have many old-style Mexican food restaurants with a classic atmosphere like Los Olivos. For this reason, Los Olivos gets four stores in my book.   Los Olivos reminds me of Mexican food restaurants I used to visit as a child. They have fiesta-themed decorations, plenty of decorated tile, an adobe mission style atmosphere and good food and drinks. Yes, there is better food in the Valley...much better in fact. However, Los Olivos is a good choice if you want to have a casual dinner in a festively-themed atmosphere that serve margaritas in pitchers!   For food, I eat the same type of Mexican food everywhere I go, and the same goes for Los Olivos. I like their guacamole, quesadillas, chile rellenaos and chicken burritos. As for the margaritas, they are classic margaritas that go down smoothly. Again, this restaurant gets the stars mostly for a festive atmosphere and decent cuisine and cocktails to accompany it.",

When I'm in Arizona, I always assume I'm in luck with Mexican food.  With this visit to AZ, I think I had better Mexican style food at my hotel than here!    My friend boasted about how they have the same old lady making the tortillas from when the restaurant opened so many years ago.  That's cool, I guess.  The tortillas were ok, so were the tortilla chips.  The rest of the food was a big, fat meh.  I ordered the steak tacos --- the steak was over cooked and dry.  The dishes was very Americanized; the tacos were served with cabbage (?), is that normal?  My friends' dishes were swimming in cheese.  The guacamole appetizer was good, so I guess that earns a star.  Listen, I'm no mexican food aficionado...I live in Michigan for heaven-sakes.  But we do have a small, but good Mexicantown in Detroit.  I've tried the food there many a times, and sadly Olivos pales in comparison to the joints in Michigan.  Honestly, this wasn't my favorite place I went to on this visit to AZ.  Thankfully, the evening was saved because I was hanging out with a friend --- otherwise I think I may cried in to my guacamole with disappointment.",

    "text": "We are in Scottsdale for the night and asked the hotel clerk at the reception desk to recommend a good and close Mexican restaurant.  He told us about Los Olivos and we were not disappointed that we followed his advice.  The restaurant is family-owned and operated and, according to the clerk, a local favorite.  The first thing I noticed was the charming structure and unique architecture character and design of the restaurant.  The atmosphere, complete with live mariachi band, lends itself to a delightful dining experience.  The salsa is AMAZING!  It was really so good, I wanted to take some home with me to pour over chicken, eggs, taco salads, etc.   The fish tacos were truly the best I have ever had.  We also ordered the appetizer sampler which turned out to be not great, so I would pass on that.",

I kind of thought that would be the case as the website showed no prices on the menu.  I've had food just as good, but much more reasonably priced in my opinion. Just be aware of \"sticker shock \" if you go. Service was good. I gave it 3 stars for \"value\"",

Lovely people. But most of the food is just ok. Everyone liked the cheese crisps, which were on very thin, crispy tortillas. The beef burrito was beef and a tortilla -- nothing else; very bland. I had the fish taco. Rubios is far better. Combo plates are in the $12-15 range, which I think is robbery for food this average. If you're craving 70s Mexican food, with soupy refried beans, gobs of cheese, this might be your place.",

It is so authentic and delicious- I have not been able to find these kinds of enchiladas anywhere else.   My parents usually get the chicken chimi enchilada style, and think it is the greatest thing on their menu. I would opt for the chicken enchiladas. Remember Mexican food is heavy, so go with a good appetite. Portions are quite large, too.  Setting is very old-but has been family operated forever.  Great to go casually or to enjoy some real mexican food!!",

But the bottom line is that customers come for the food, and it was sorely lacking.

The booze was pretty good, but the food was pretty lackluster. With the exception exception of the fish tacos of course.  A restaurant this caliber has the potential for kicking butt, but doesn't because of fear from losing their regular clientelle. The old tired out menu, prolly old tired out cook, plus the old tired out bar strongly indicates that this place never ever changed since they opened up decades ago. Judging by the people that eat here, you can definitely bet that they'll tell you straight up, they've been coming here since God knows when.  Hopefully they'll turn this spot around. There's a revolution going on guys. Don't forget that for every one person that doesn't like change, there's 10 others that actually do. Target the hipsters, they're the new generation with the expendable income.  I probably won't be back to dine here any time soon. Maybe if I see from other yelpers post pics of a menu change and new food then I'd reconsider. Other than that, I'll be taking the good hike out to Jalisco Taqueria instead.",

Unfortunately, the food is thoroughly Americanized, heavy and mediocre at best. I'm not sure what ingredient they use - lard, maybe?- that makes me feel like there's a boulder in my stomach after eating there. I recently ordered the Huevos Rancheros with eggs scrambled and the result was dried out and boring. A colleague who is Hispanic pointed out that the dish bore no resemblance to traditional Huevos Rancheros.  If you are looking for Mexican food in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area there are much, much better alternatives than Los Olivos. I work nearby and have reluctantly gone along when colleagues wanted to eat here but this will be my last time.",

That can't be a bad thing I thought, right?   I had a chili releno and it was one of the best I've ever had.     Every item our group ordered was great.   The beans and rice were perfect.    The salsa was very fresh and hot.   Little bit to much for me but I'm wimpy.    Prices are very reasonable.    Good portions for prices.  If you want good food I'd totally recommend going here.   If I'm back in Scottsdale I'm definitely going back!!",

I definitely agree that it's more of the classic style Mexican restaurants - big layout, Spanish style tiles, decorations, and a very old fragile burro statue out front. The prices weren't bad, and food was pretty good too! The waiter was also a tall drink of water, which is always a nice perk ;) The salsa was especially good and homemade, yum!!",

With a prime location on the corner off 2nd, next to the Scottsdale Performing Arts Center, you can't go wrong.  Now, I have to be honest, I only had one thing to eat and drink. So my review is limited. I had the rolled tacos with sour cream and guac. It was okay. They were very generous with the guac. Service was with a smile. The drink was strong but good. You can tell they want you to have a good time.  Problem: the place needs a lot of TLC. There was exposed plaster on the wall in the \"Aztec God\" room by the exit door. There were nice paintings on the wall and then random beer advertisments on the wall. The floor uneven and the 'used to be stage' was a open storage area. Then a tv and boom box exposed in the room as if set in your personal living room.  All in all, try it because it looks fun. But then just check it off your list.",

I settled for a LA cart bean and cheese burrito.  It was disappointing.  They didn't heat up my burrito all the way. .the beans inside were barely warm.  Food overall was mediocre.  Free chips and salsa nothing to brag about.  Service was good. I definitely won't be coming back here.

We visited this place last Monday night and I have to say it's as I remember it. The staff is very friendly and quick; the atmosphere gives off an old, rustic Mexican village vibe and the food isn't too shabby. The best thing about this place is their meal portions. Anything you get here is huge! You definitely have to take home left overs because there is just so much. This last visit I enjoyed the nachos, all by myself (getting my food baby on) and I took home half my platter. Of course in this case these nachos come out pilled with meat, beans, cheese, jalapenos..... on a pizza pan! Holy nachos!!! I feel the meat could have had a little better flavoring but the abundance of cheese was perfect! I love cheese on my nachos! My friend ordered their enchilada plate, along with that he got rice and beans. The enchilada was nice and spicy and the refried beans were pretty tasty. Im not a huge fan of rice, so in my book it was ok, a little dry.... But ok. The food didn't blow me away, but it hit the spot!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that to get 1 star from me is hard.  I will give anyone a chance (or 2, off nights happen to the best of us), but I have never been so disappointed  in Mexican food as I was last night.  And this was not the first time I've been to Los Olivos.  We were regulars for a very long time (even organizing office Christmas parties there), but the quality of the food, the taste of the food, the service and the employees dedication has taken a severe nose dive over the last few years.  But having not been in about 2 years I stupidly thought I would give it another chance with the hopes that changes in staff and time would have made the experience better.  For a restaurant THAT close to a spring training facility, they should be striving to be the best and attract the clientele that will come back year after year. Word of mouth is key in Scottsdale to keeping a business going.  You can have a flashy restaurant, fancy chef, but if the food and service sucks, no one will go.  I have been here MANY times over the years and last night was THE most dreadful.  To start with the guy taking names at the front was totally disinterested in being there.  I spelled my name for him and he still spelled it wrong.  When I corrected him he ignored me.  I spelled it again and he gave me a blank stare and said kind of half-assed \"sorry\", but didn't change it and continued his riveting conversation with the bus boy that he must have felt I  interrupted.   We were seated in the back room by the patio and ignored for 10 minutes (no menus, no drinks).  Our waitress was obviously slammed because we saw her running back and forth the whole time covering the inside and the patio and another dining room.  The noise level was the loudest it has ever been.  The salsa was all tomato water and no substance.  The \"fresh lime margarita\" had almost no tequila and the strongest taste of bottled lime juice ever.  The food was awful.  We ordered a cheese crisp and my daughter took one bite and said it was gross.  I tried it and she was right.  The oil coming off the cheese was immense and the tortilla was burnt.  I brushed off the bad cheese crisp, thinking (hoping) it was just an off night, but when I got my Steak Picado, the beans and rice were the worst I've ever had.  The rice was dry, tasteless and clumped together.  The beans were crusty and had no flavor.  But they did have a huge puddle of oil forming on the top.  The steak was fine, but after having tried the rice and beans my stomach hurt and I couldn't eat.    My husband ordered the Mexican pizza and he had the same puddle of oil on his.  He asked for no tomatoes and it was covered in tomatoes.  The meat was fine, but again the tortilla was burnt.  The friend we brought with us barely touched her burrito.  We were all unsatisfied.  I was even more upset when I got a $60+ bill after telling the waitress we were unhappy.  I will never go back.  I was willing to give them another chance last night, but there are way better restaurants to choose from and spend less money at for really good food.",

I just recently came here and realized that this restaurant is not very authentic Mexican food but is targeted to the more Caucasian crowd. I don't mean any offense but, the food is not spicy, even though they say it is. The tacos had very little meat and te cheese enchiladas were a lot of cheese, and the tamales had no flavor.  The prices for the meal are not outrageous but not consistent with what you order.   As for the staff they are not very friendly and come off as if they don't care what the customer thinks. We were served by a guy of the name Moreno (that's what the ticket says and I'm not sure because he didn't have a name tag.) he never checked to see how our food was and hardly walked around to other tables to see how they were doing. He took more time trying to get a black folder to give our ticket and walking around us with our ticket rather than givin it to is directly. As for the bus/water boy was doing an amazing job clearing tables and all the duties that Moreno couldn't do.   I almost forgot about the cheese crisp. It was very greasy but oddly the tortilla was hard and cardboard like. It was gross.",

    "text": "Tucked in a quiet corner of Old Town Scottsdale, Los Olivos is the kitschy landmark best known as the oldest Authentic Mexican restaurant in the area.  Upon first look, the building, built in the 1950's is spewing charm. Designed by the Grandfather of the current owners, the space is architecturally pleasing and interesting to the eye.  Unfortunately, the building wears it age. The stucco walls and dated floors are stained from fiestas gone by.  During my visit, I happily watched as the highly intuitive and competent wait staff wiped down mirrors and did basic cleaning between serving the few occupied tables throughout the dining areas.  The complimentary chips were crisp and salty, and the salsas, although a tad watery, were perfectly spiced and served in carafes, making for a table full of messy plates. The Carne Asada meal was served with a green salad, yellow rice, a giant fresh cooked tortilla, rough chopped pico de gallo and refried beans. The green salad was surprisingly filling and topped with a gratuitous serving of shredded cheese. The Carne Asada was well seasoned, although for the price ($16), I found the meat to be a bit tough and overall underwhelming. The mushroom enchiladas were again, decent and large, but not worth the price of $14.  I would describe the food at Los Olivos as comfort food: a salty, cheesy, plate of fatty goodness that would cure a hangover or call for a mid-day nap. The service was friendly and welcoming, and the building's kitschy design makes for great photo opportunities. All in all, the pricing is consistent with Old Town Scottsdale, yet not on par with the quality of food. If you are looking for Authentic Mexican food that will blow you away, I would try elsewhere. However, I would recommend Los Olivos for the atmosphere and attentive service. I'm looking forward to returning for a night of Margaritas and appetizers. Los Olivos' charm is the perfect companion for an evening of laughing and drinking with friends.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying this. I have heard about this restaurant nonstop for a year now from a co worker who raves about this place. Its not in my neighborhood but finally decided to try it out when I saw a groupon for it online. We made our way east yesterday with high expectations and an empty stomach.   First off, kind of strange location. Maybe its just me, we live downtown phx not old town Scottsdale. Its stuck between hospitals and out patient clinics, just off Scottsdale road. Parking is tight, you'll have to walk around the building to enter. The building is old, but beautiful in an old Spanish charm kind of way. Cute, fine we'll enter. Right when you walk in it states to wait to be seated. And that's exactly what we did. We waited....and waited some more. They were definitely not busy, from what I saw.   When we were finally seated, it was at an extremely small table against a wall. Figured I could make it work, it was me and a 5 year old. A gentleman brought us chips and salsa, and I saw something was a little odd. The salsa was brought out in these tall narrow pouring things that you cannot fit a chip in to dip. Once I looked around, I realized they did not provide bowls either, so here I was pouring salsa on an appetizer plate making a bigger mess than the kid was!  I had scanned the menu online prior to driving out there because im terribly picky and take too long to decide, causing my kindergartener to get irritated. I decided after previewing it that I would get Pollo a la Queso Crema ((a flour tortilla stuffed with chicken breast, deep fried and topped with seasoned cream cheese & melted cheeses, served with beans & rice)) Yes, that's directly copied and pasted from their menu.   Sounds good right. Well holy heck it better be for 15 BUCKS! My cheap self cringed at that amount (terrible I know). Good thing I had bought a groupon so it was discounted. The kiddo got the kids combo, a beef taco and enchilada, with rice and beans. I decided to try a blended house margarita, crossing my fingers it wasn't going to cost me $10 bucks, the liquor prices are conveniently never on the menus right!!!  The waitress was extremely prompt, and friendly...older lady. She was very pleasant. The food was good, and decent portion. Overall though, I would not come out of my way to eat here again, and definitely wouldn't pay menu price. If I came across another groupon for them, I suppose I would visit again. If you live in the area, and arnt as cheap as me, then yes I recommend it.",

The lady that served us was very kind and she did take care of our requests. She waved some of the extra costs that are normally included to accommodate us.

    "text": "What a horrible experience... First of all making a reservation isn't even useful because the old man at the front door acting as host will maybe write your name down on three separate pieces of paper that he can't even keep organized. They should get a computerized system to seriously organize their wait times. We made a 7pm reservation and they totally forgot that, and made us wait another 30 minutes after 7. Total unorganized and unprofessional, thinking they don't even have to acknowledge any frustrated customers, everyone was dealing with the same problem.  Finally we just went to the bar to order drinks while we waited, and there was literally one bartender making drinks for the floor, you had to chase down a waiter picking up their drinks to even get an order in for drinks.  We finally sat down an ordered drinks in a bizarre dining area, feels like you are literally in Mexico its so random. After 30 maybe more minutes of waiting for drinks at the table and being totally starving and finishing our chips, we could finally order. The food took literally an hour and a half to get to our table. To say the quality was bad is an understatement, especially for $16 fajitas, are you kidding. I would have much rather gone to Taco Bell, Chipolte, even Filabertos... I had to spit out half of it because of such low quality. They tried to fill you up with the overflow of onions to make you feel full. What a waste of money.  We never got a refill on chips, we had to chase down a waiter again, and our drinks were never refilled. The busser girl was rude to my grandma, when my grandma literally asked for her name in the beginning. The waitress but okay, but still was preoccupied by being disorganized with all her other tables.  To top it all of, gratuity was added in, if I could've given a negative tip I would have. This place is disorganized, rude, and low quality. They should give up their prime spot in Old Town for a more professional and higher quality establishment to actually make my time worthwhile. If you go here, go luck. I'd save your time on Saturday night and hit up the local Taco Bell late night, at least they'll be friendly.",

We sat down, ordered a few drinks & were promptly brought chips & salsa to snack on while looking over the menu. The salsa was very good & we both liked the chips but kept adding more salt. It was nice they didn't come coated in case someone doesn't like or can't have sodium.  Our server, Erika, came by twice to see if we were ready to order. We asked for more time. She was very kind & left us alone until we called her back.  I'm a picky eater & modify most orders when eating out. I get nervous requesting modifications because 75% of the time the food comes out wrong. I was pleasantly surprised when everything came out absolutely PERFECT!! The fajita pans were sizzling & everything smelled amazing!   We both got the steak & chicken combo fajitas cooked w/onions, tomatoes and green & red bell peppers. They also come with the most amazing refried beans covered in cheese, guacamole and sour cream. I also ask for shredded cheese & lettuce to put on the tortilla to make a sort-of 'soft taco' It was all absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  Erika came by to make sure we were ok & brought out the additional tortillas we requested along w/more wine & told us to let her know if we needed anything else. We enjoyed our meal & never felt rushed she wanted to turn the table because it was 6:30 on a Saturday.  I complimented Erika for making us feel welcome, not rolling her eyes when I ordered, bringing out everything correctly, always smiling & being overall wonderful. I also asked for her manager to let him know how wonderful she is. He must've thought I was going to complain about something & was very pleases to hear the kind words & compliments about Erika.  Every time I go back to Los Olivos, I will request to sit in Erika's section!!",

    "text": "Sooo...I was in Scottsdale for the day to visit a friend who was also visiting the city (she's from Texas and I recently moved to Tucson).  They had already been in town a few days and we were walking around Old Town looking for a place to eat.  We wanted to get Mexican, since after all, this is Arizona, and so I thought to ask someone working at a local business where a good place to go would be.  Without hesitation the woman/local pointed us towards this place, saying \"it's the only place in town with good Mexican food.\"  Now, after having experienced it, I must say, if this is the best Scottsdale has to offer, they're in pretty bad shape and should be kicked out of Arizona.    The breakdown:  The interior and exterior of the place are very authentic and interesting architecturally.  This is about the only thing that really \"wowed\" us about the place.  We were a party of three (me, my friend and her mom).  The tortilla chips were \"meh\"  and the salsas, pretty bland and forgettable. My friend ordered the fish tacos, her mom, the taco salad (with chicken), and myself the cheese and mushroom enchiladas.  All of the items were quite bland.  I had to seriously douse my order in hot salsa just to give it \"some\" flavor, the rice was flavorless and clumpy and looked like it was cooked a week prior, the beans, also flavorless.  With the addition of the hot salsa my dish was mediocre.    The servers we had didn't ask how our food was (probably because she- or they- already knew it wasn't very good), my friend and her mom didn't even want to pack their food to go, it was that bad.    Now, I lived in Chicago for 18 years before my recent move to Tucson, and there are many Mexican places that would put this place to shame, and this is in the freaking Midwest!    Also, the food is overpriced.  It's about the quality of a Chi-Chi's (are those even still around?) but double the price.   Having read through the reviews it seems the place was once very good (and reasonably priced) but this clearly isn't the case any longer.  Finally, anyone claiming that the food is authentic, is deceiving you.  That wasn't my main contention, however (I do live in Tucson after all, which has no shortage of authentic Mexican) as I have no problem with Americanized Mexican if it's at least good.  But I can definitely see it being a disappointment to someone who may be visiting Arizona from another part of the country and looking forward to authentic Mexican food.  So, if you want mediocre, overpriced Mexican food, and happen to be in Scottsdale, this is your Mecca.  Otherwise go to the Chipotle -their food is at least  flavorful, and you won't feel you got ripped off....",

The best tasting pico de Gallo ever.   I can usually resist chips, but c'mon!  This was awesome.   My fish tacos were delicious. No complaints at all.  Hubs had the mini combo.  It all looked good, but he thought it was just so-so. The price is right,band you can get in without a reservation.",

Sometimes you do have to wait awhile for the food.  The wait staff is usually pretty good.   The food is always fresh and served hot.  Today I ordered the Chimichanga plate.  The shredded beef is always delicious.  There homemade salsa is so delicious.    I'm not sure exactly what restaurant a previous reviewer ate at stating they ate garbage.  Maybe they were at Taco Bell.    You won't be disappointed with Los Olivio's but be patient.  Authentic food that's fresh takes time so enjoy visiting with friends and family while you wait.",

I got 10% cash back on my purchase and I didn't do anything but pay with my credit card that I had on file with Yelp.  That's incentive enough to return, but the margarita was pretty good (salt was questionable, because... table salt?!) and the food was not bad either.   I was there for a party, but we had catered food, some chimichanga things, cheese crisps (is this an Arizona thing? It's weird, but delicious, so I'm not complaining), chips and all the delicious dips and toppings.  The ambiance in their pseudo indoor/outdoor room was great and it backed right up to the bar, of which was obviously necessary, so yeah. Oh, and it's really the little things, because as you leave, they have chocolate mints (2 kinds, actually) and a burro out the front door. The whole place was definitely cooler than your average Mexican restaurant. The food wasn't better than others, but good for sure.",

The Chips and Salsa were brought to our table as soon as we sat down, chips were very fresh, thin and crispy. They served the chips with 2 canister-type things of salsa. They were both very good but I liked mixing the two, it made for one damn good salsa! My dad was in the drinking mood so he ordered a pitcher of Margaritas and man oh man that was a great way to get our meal started!   For dinner I ordered the Pollo a la Queso Crema, a flour tortilla filled with chicken, then fried, and lastly topped with a seasoned cream cheese and melted cheeses. This meal was phenomenal!!!! The seasoned cream cheese gave this just enough tanginess along with all the savory aspects the chicken has. Thinking about this, makes my mouth water and wonder if Los Olivos delivers to Northern California?!?!?  Next year when I am back in Scottsdale this will be my first stop as soon as my plane lands and the last place I go before I head to the airport to come home. AWESOME FOOD. Good wait staff. Wouldn't change a thing about this place.",

I usually opt for a cheese crisp with green onions and green chilies and a side of guacamole (which is always yummy but pricey) and I still pay for all that $15 plus what ever we are drinking.... I love the overly rustic atmosphere, but it really could use some updating and maybe a good scrub.... Some of the servers are not the friendliest, but these are mostly the family that work there and have been there forever, so don't take it personally....

We were seated next to the fish tank which was great because it kept my 2 year old daughter fascinated. The decor is very interesting and there are plants and neat windows that give you the sensation of being in an underwater cafe.  The chips were yummy. We polished off like 3 baskets of them. The salsa was okay and yes it came in a carafe and we had to ask for bowls. Not quite sure how to fit my chip in a carafe.  I ordered the frozen strawberry margarita with no booze. It was okay but I've had better. My daughter liked it. I ordered a chicken chimichanga because the guy at the table next to me was eating a shrimp one, and his looked PHENOMENAL. Mine was okay but after I got it I wished I ordered the same one the other guy had.  My husband ordered a carnitas burro. It was, literally, meat in a tortilla. There was nothing else in it. No cheese, no tomatoes. Just meat. And it was completely dry. He wasn't thrilled.   We got a cheese quesadilla for our daughter, and that was good.   We would eat there again because it's better than the other Mexican places we have tried around here (hard to believe I can't find a decent one when we are so close to Mexico!) but my husband said he would order something different.",

Their salsa is delicious, margaritas are perfect, and their cheese crisp was a part of my diet for a long time before I moved away from eating so much cheese...  One thing I will mention (especially if you are vegan), they use cottage cheese in their guac. I don't think that's right, it's clearly a cheap filler ingredient. Make sure to ask for it regular and they'll make it for you. That response was what got them four stars instead of anything less :)",

The food is authentic and tastes as good as it reads on the menu. Anytime family members come into town for visits or vacations they always ask to go to Los Olivos. Enough said. This restaurant is amazing.",

It was mostly ground up corn and smothered in sauce and no flavors or seasoning at all. Also the fish taco was eh. Chips were good, salsa was super watery. The only decent thing I had there was the margarita, and even that needed a wedge of lime.  I will say we got a nice booth, and the live band that played was sweet. Service was so slow, our waitress only came around half the time. A bus boy refilled out drinks more than she did!",

I had the chicken tortilla soup (which was bomb!) and a chile relleno (also yummy!), waiters kept my cup full and the complimentary chips & salsa flowing.

LOVED IT!  ALSO: The ambiance here is great, I loved the strange architectural features of the dining room..

The restaurant has been owned and operated by one family, although I'm not sure if there were still members working there... But if so, that's pretty cool to me.  Again, I was greeted with an expansive menu to choose from. They give you chips and salsa for you to wet your appetite as you debate what you're going to get. Both the mild and the hot salsa was pretty good, and the hot salsa definitely has a kick to it!   I ordered the Flautas Ana and was given a big plate of 3 Flautas topped with lettuce, onion, tomatoes, and avocado with a side of beans and rice. I also ordered a side of guac, which I didn't really need because of the avocado. This was learned after the fact.   I didn't eat dessert due to having my heart set on another place, but my friend got the French vanilla fried ice cream which was BOMB!! The French vanilla flavor coupled with the churro-style crusting made it super delicious!!   Definitely enjoyed the restaurant and what it had to offer. I would love to come here another time with my family.",

I've been disappointed for years, today I came in with family, it's been a while. Disappointed, as I have been last few years. The prices change like the economy but you would think the flavor would remain the same, good homemade Mexican. Far from it. Taco salad in my home has beans, not a chicken salad mix thrown into ice berg lettuce w a lot of sour cream. It's gross, waste of money. The drinks are good, only thing they care about. The green chili tamale was bland. Too much salt on the chips. Two stars only because this is my childhood. Food needs to bump, people come and make it busy because it's a staple. 70+years, it's known. It's not great. There's better \"homemade\" Mexican than this. Phoenix.",

The rice was mushy, however the beans were okay. I had the chicken burro enchilada style and the chicken was boiled and dry. The enchilada sauce was bland and my rice was also mushy. The service was very slow. It took 30 minutes to get our food and there were only 5 other tables with customers. The chips and salsa were tasty and while waiting for our food I squeezed lime juice over the chips and added a little salt - that was tasty.",

I got the mini sampler so I could try the beef tacos, chimis, and flautas. They were delicious and it came with a very generous side of the best guacamole I've ever had. They also gave me a big bag of chips and two different sides of really tasty salsas. I look forward to dining in and trying some more of their food.",

    "text": "After trying many different Mexican restaurants this past year I always go back to Old Town Los Olivos.   The chips and salsa are always served right away and they deliver a spicy and mild salsa. They are refilled often and it's easy to fill up on them before your meal arrives, you've been warned!   I always get the lunch combo with a cheese enchilada, taco and all rice for around $8.50. Every time the plate is delivered the meal is hot and delicious. The rice is made the traditional Mexican way and is so yummy.   The beer selection is decent and the glasses are nice and cold. Their Coke is also really cold with lots of bubbles it doesn't have that heavy syrup taste. The cold Coke compliments the hot meal every time.   The place gets very busy so if you're eating in the dining room prepare to have a leisurely lunch. I eat at the bar and service is really fast.",

Service was ridiculously slow and there weren't more than 20 people in the place. We were a party of three and we saw the waitress a total of four times in the hour it took us to eat and get out.  Asked twice for drink refills and never did get them.  Had to flag a busboy down with a water pitcher just to get that.  Seemed like plenty of staff on hand, they just didn't seem to be paying attention to the diners. Food was blah and pretty tasteless.  Prices seemed high for the quality of food.  The place looks really run down, light fixtures were filthy and half the light bulbs were burned out.  Overall the whole place looked very worn and dirty.  We've gone there for years, but won't be back again any time soon. Not a great experience at all.",

Are you people really that stupid that you don't know that the carafe of salsa is so you can pour it over anything on your plate?  and on the small side plate to dip your chips in?  it's perfect poured on the beans and rice; Jeez, you all sound like idiots for complaining about this like it's someone else's fault that you aren't smart enough to figure it out. anyway the salsa is award-winning, the cheese crisp with chiles and onions was very good, I had an excellent plate of Machaca which is very hard to find outside of Tucson, and Linda had halibut with a veracruzano sauce that was damn near perfect.  Negro Modelo on draft, and fresh coffee too. No complaints for me - and did anyone notice the front room dome ceiling done by Paolo Soleri? it is a spectacular work of art, as are the wonderful hand-drawn murals. there is a bit of attitude problem there at the front; it's because they always have enough customers to keep the place hopping - and there's a lot of reasons why",

    "text": "I heart Los Olivos, and in ways that go over and beyond any other Mexican places I've ever been.  Using my strict algorithm for Mexican perfection of chips, salsa, red sauce and margarita, Los Olivos becomes the benchmark by which all other places are compared.  Love it.  CHIPS are crispy, warm and perfectly thin.  I salt them and go to town on the freshly prepared SALSA, an addictive blend of tomatoes and jalapenos mixed with their HOT SALSA of red chiles and scarcely a tomato.  The flavor is just divine, best washed down with a FRESH LIME MARGARITA and plenty of salt.  I could dine on just the following and call it a day, but if I have a group to share with (or a lion's appetite) I will indulge in a cheese crisp.  The tortilla is pliable and perfectly chewy, and the Mary Lou with green chile con carne comes with a toothsome topping of tender beef chunks braised in green chile sauce and topped with melted cheese.  So good!  Our usual favorites are the beef tamales, crispy chicken tacos, enchiladas of all kinds, the chimichangas (my husband eats the SHRIMP CHIMI every single time we go, without fail) and the sumptuously perfect machaca, served dry with the perfect blend of spices and goodness and a tortilla to boot.  Num num num.  The service can be slow and at times lackadaisical - on other nights, the waiters are attentive and blazingly fast.  Just depends who you get.  If you go on an off night for service, definitely don't give up because the food is so darn tasty.  Rather, go when you have time to kill, eat and drink heartily, and know that you are in for a treat of an evening.  Sidenote: Man peddling roses inside the restaurant is persistent - I'm still trying to figure out who he knows or how he's related to the owners in order to be allowed to interfere with the service in the place.  Your guess is as good as mine.",

The service was lacking, it took us about 10-15 mins to get the chips, with no drink orders taken yet. Then a couple minutes later our waitress came by to get our drinks.  When a waiter came by with the drinks, I could barely hear what he was saying and I didn't even get what I ordered. He had no idea what half the drinks actually were and didn't care. The food was greasy and bland, I ordered the Mexican Flag. I didn't eat even half of it. I had finished my drink pretty fast, and it was on the edge of the table for the whole time we were there and no one refilled it, good thing I had a water. The best thing was the chips, and on a plus the atmosphere was nice. Overall I would not waste my time or money (a little pricey) ever again.",

From the front door donkey to the blue-tinted aquarium area to the Diego Rivera replicated art in the old Mexican adobe main dining room, it is a neat place to eat.  However, if you are looking for great Mexican food in Arizona, it would not be my first choice. The service is fast and friendly and I love the mariachi band and occasional live music however the food is less than desirable. My favorite meal is the Pollo a La Queso Crema but sometimes the chicken is dry and the rice and beans are crusty from sitting too long on a hot plate. There is a definite difference in quality when the restaurant is busy, so timing can be everything. It's a great spot to get a margarita after a Giants Spring Training game but for a good meal, it's just okay.",

    "text": "Ttoday I am writing about Los Olivos Patio.  This is a place that I recommend to peeps when they want good mexican food and don't care about the looks of the place.  On those qualifications,Los Olivos would be a good fit.  Put it this way:  if you are looking for the hotties of Scottsdale, go RIIIGGGGHHHHT by this place.  I really think that they could do alot better with some cleaning up and  razing of a few areas.  But I guess.. if you are looking for good Mexican, maybe the grungier the better and the more real.  The cool thing about Los Olivos is that it has been in the same location with basically the same cooks and the same waitresses and the same family ownership since like the 50s.  You can't say that about many businesses anymore.  And that goes a long way towards what I think makes Mexican food good.. I wanna feel like I accidentally walked into someone's house in South Phoenix and the entire familia has gotten together for tia's cooking!  I have eaten at Los Olivos many, many times and I just think that the food is really done well. They have great chips and two kinds of salsa... hot and a chunkier, milder sauce.  Personally, I mix the two.  Their margaritas are addictive and my favorite restaurant item is their pollo asado- it is a mustard-marinated chicken breast that they serve with the requisite beans and rice and it is mucho good-o.  Their tortillas are made in the restaurant and I take a few of those, spoon some chicken on them, a lil' rice and beans and pico de gallo and whammie, a great taco that is reasonably low fat.  Hey, gotta keep my trim figure, right?  Their enchiladas are good as well.. lots of cheese and tasty.         So I guess I like this place as my fave for Mexican done right.  YOu just have to look past the icky surroundings and realize that GOOD Mexican is not about the location but about the food.  You have to  look deeper than the outside, like with people.  Wow, that was deep- I may need to go have a pedi and hang out at Kierland Commons to get back to my normal shallow, artificial nature.",

Sadly there isn't a single thing that I can point out that was bad.....but nothing was that good either. We had a largish party and I arrived late. It was an early dinner on a Saturday night so no waiting and the table already had chips and salsa on the table when I got there. I am not eating chips but everyone else seemed to like theirs. I thought the salsa was very shallow in its flavor. I like a deeper more roasted flavor. I asked for lemon with my water and he brought me a whole plate. I struggled to find the right thing to eat that wouldn't throw me completely off my no starch low sugar diet. I ended up with a chicken tostada a la cart and left the tortilla. It was perfect for me and pretty tasty. I know others were underwhelmed. I wouldn't \"not\" eat there again if others were going but I think I would rather try restaurants with a stronger point of view anc commitment to excellence.",

We ordered a pitcher of margaritas and were disappointed there as well. The margaritas lacked any real taste and we were charged $35 for the pitcher (price not listed on the menu). When we tried to voice our concerns to the manager, we were told too bad, that's the way it is. This place is just a tourist trap in Old Town Scottsdale.",

One star is exaggerating its quality. Looks like I'm never coming back.",

He acted as though he was being greatly inconvenienced when we asked for a table. He had no method to his maddness for seating. He told us there was a 45 minute wait and that we should wait by the bar. We waited for about an hour and 15 minutes, before we asked him again for a table. We saw many people who came in behind us already enjoying their food. He purposely ignored us. Even once we were seated the food was just mediocre at best.",

I am guessing somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 years!  so I guess today was my day!  We had a team lunch to introduce a new team member to everyone and this was the chosen destination.  Let me just say that if you have a large party of 10 or more and want the lunch experience to be handled efficiently this is your place!  Our waitress was so efficient!  We never waited for anything... our drink order was taken promptly and soon after our order was taken our food came right out!  Being that we had 14 people in the party I was pretty impressed.  Lastly to make things more challenging for our waitress everyone was paying their own bill (argh!) it could have been overwhelming.  The chips and salsa were very good for my lunch entree I chose the Mexican pizza with ground beef.  I enjoyed the Mexican pizza except for the ground beef part... they just dumped ground beef on top of the pizza... I thought it would be part of the pizza.  Anyway I would say we had a good experience at Los Olivos... high five to the wait staff!",

I'm from the Philly area, although we do have some choice Mexican resturants, they simply pare in comparisson tot his place. I discovered this resturant by accident really. I was searchign for a place to have lunch last year after a 90 minute tour of Frank Lloyd Wright's Talyesen West homestead, and accidently came across this amazing resturant. I enjoyed the place so much that I returned this month, as this was the next time  that I made it out to Phoenix. The aesthetics of the place are spot on, the food is exceptional, with a wide variety to select from o nthe extensive menu..and the most important attribute, the quality of the food, authentic tasting and looking fown tothe last taco bite!!! They even offer for $2.00 a 32 ounce of Dos Equis on tap!!!! Astounding!!! Viva Los Olivos!!!",

Wonderful service (they even let us watch the NCAA game on the stage big screen on a Saturday afternoon), and amazing food. the vegetarian chimichanga is perfect -- lots of buttery cauliflower, broccoli, onions and mushrooms, not too heavy on the frying and smothered in melted rich cheddar. Top that with their pico de gallo and salsa from individual carafes on the table, and sour cream and it's just the best.   Also the atmosphere is fun, not stuffy in the least, and the ceiling opens on nice days, giving a feeling of being outside somewhere friendly and tropical. We'll be back!",

I usually go for burritos, and they have all been serviceable. The chicken does tend to be very bland, but you can always add salsa. We have also always found the service to be very attentive.

We had to wave down our server every time we needed something, even though she was always standing nearby. However, the food came quickly (including chips and salsa) and my water glass was refilled often.   The food itself was...ok? Good-ish? Odd? But probably mainly because of what I ordered.  First, the chips were thin and crispy and they bring you two types of salsa. I enjoyed the pico/chunky one a lot. The only thing that annoyed me is that the salsa comes in small carafes and you pour them onto a small plate.  I personally think chasing salsa around a plate is stupid and would much prefer a bowl.  I was trying to be reasonably healthy and ordered the Pollo Asado, which states it's a grilled chicken breast marinated in a mustard sauce. It's definitely marinated in a mustard sauce! It was good, just kind of weird in general and especially for a mexican restaurant. The refried beans and rice were absolutely outstanding though, and the tortillas are homemade. The meal also comes with a house salad that was drenched in ranch, but otherwise fresh and a side of \"pico de gallo\" which was warm and had green chili in it (didn't like that).  I also had their house margarita which had the signature bright yellow green color of a cheap mix, but was decently strong and on sale for happy hour.   All in all, not a bad experience, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.",

My daughter and wife had very average quesadillas.  We came back this year looking forward to another authentic Mexican meal. We were met with horrible service form a server who did not know the beer menu, did not listen to our requests to put sauces on the side and overall an unpleasant experience. Our server was an older woman with blond hair, I wish I had her name to provide this feedback to management. We will not come back.",

    "text": "So it starts like this. I walk in and see two counters with people standing at them. The first has a girl standing there wiping down a menu. She looks up and doesn't say anything. I ask if we can be seated and she still says absolutely nothing. I walk over to the other counter and stand in front of the gentleman at that counter. He stares at me, doesn't greet me, and asks, \"do you want to eat?\" Well, of course I do.   He walks passed the first of multiple open tables. He stops at the first. Shakes his head and keeps moving, goes do a second, stops, and then continues. At this point I'm really confused. It is obvious by the hosts body language he doesn't want to be there and could give two shits about his job.   After passing the third table he balks at that and places me and my son in the furthest corner table possible. He throws two menus down and I ask if he has a kids menu. No smile, no emotion, just pretty much turns and walks away. I waited about 7 or 8 minutes and he never returned. I walked to the front to find an employee but I couldn't find anyone anywhere. No joke! The same female stood there and I asked if he worked here. She looked up at me and then put her head down and totally ignored me. I was miffed but I figured Id stick it out. I walked back without the menu.  A server walked by us. Ignored us again. After about 10 minutes someone came out with waters. Let me preface this by saying there was approximately 15 people in the restaurant at this time. I asked for a kids menu again and this server finally spoke up and said they are making copies of one.    Eventually service came and we were able to order. I was l, well, pretty underwhelmed with the food. The absolutely horrible welcome and service left a sour taste which wasn't helped by average food. It was very obvious why it was dead at 6pm in downtown Scottsdale. If they ever want to survive they need to do a 180 degree turn. My recommendation would be to walk around the corner to The Mission.",

    "text": "Absolutely. Horrible. These are the best words I have to explain my experience here. Before coming in, my sister and I reviewed the menu and were extremely excited to come in as everything sounded amazing. Upon arrival, we were seated and given chips and salsa which were absolutely delicious. We really had high hopes at this point. We had a few questions about the menu regarding a simple substitution of carne asada for the steak that was apart of the tacos al carbon. Her response was \"oh that is carne asada, al carbon means steak\". wrong. She thought she could fool me. After looking over the menu more I noticed a chicken taco plate also called \"al carbon\". After doing a quick google search I was informed that al carbon meant \"over charcoal\" NOT steak. How dare she lie to me like that?? Regardless I ordered the steak tacos and they were not good. After picking at our disappointing meal, our waitress took about 20 minutes to bring us our check after seeing us sitting around waiting. After finally bringing the check she proceeded to wait at our table to pick up our money. Considering we are from out of town, we were excited to try something new in Scottsdale but we were let down. Will NOT be coming back. Thank you.",

The service was very slow and the restaurant floor was very grimy. It took over 20 minutes for our order to be taken and they didn't want to make a shrimp taco even though they serve shrimp here. I ordered the fish tacos and I got chicken tacos instead. After telling them about the wrong order they brought me the fish tacos and they were cold and VERY dried out. I was VERY DISAPPOINTED with their lack of customer service and poor food. They didn't even offer any compensation for their mess up. We will not ever come here again! There are many more Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area that have way better food and service.",

    "text": "Tourist Trap if your here for spring training stay away.  Bad food, bad service, bad management/ ownership, decent venue and salsa.  Sold as authentic Mexican food but you probably get better authentic Mexican in a small town in Idaho or Vermont.  Not sure how this place became a \"staple\" in old town other then location but you should not go there.   The corner Fiesta Burrito by my house serves better food.  If you are looking for good Mexican there are about 20 within 5 min drive that are good with owners that care about quality not just taking your money.  If you want New Mexican Carlsbad Tavern on Hayden is great with a patio and copper bar, if you want street taco Mexican Cien Agave's is right down the street or Diego pops is on Scottsdale rd.  If you want traditional Mexican literally open google type in Mexican and anything you see is better.  Ok now to the experience, we came with a group of 20 or a going away party for a friend.  Service was very slow we ended up going to the bar to get most our drinks as it was about a 20-25 minute turn around.  They would not split checks.  When in the land of amazing mexican food its not hard to be adequate but they failed the food was dry with no body.  There was no zest it was so simple with no flavor.  Most the people there were long time AZ people and not Mexican food snobs but not one good thing was said about the food.  When it came time for the check as you can imagine it was nightmare 20 people eating and drinking and they wont split the check, not the end of the world just annoying in the 21st century. I would not have been as bad if they did not completely mess up and double bill everyone.  Now people have left and they said they accidentally cancelled the transaction so we needed to pay again.  not only that but we had to pick up the people who have already left.  The \"owner\" was outside with part of our party completely unwilling to help the process  turning this into an hour ordeal.  Guess what well they did not refund the first payment so we are all double charged now.  I call to talk to a manager tuesday she can only find the first transaction and says they never did a second not True i am looking at a closed (not pending) transaction on my account for $75.  yes you heard that right they have the one they say the cancelled but supposedly cant find the second one.  Anyway that's my experience with this place I would strongly suggest avoiding it.",

Apparently anything can go out to a table if 2 lbs of cheese is melted over the top of it. Burned beans, cheese crisp swimming in grease and tacos with a hair baked into the shell.

I have been eating Mexican food since I was a little kid, growing up in San Diego.  I've eaten in little taco shops, from street carts in Mexico (Ensenada, Rosarita Beach, Tijuana, San Felipe and Puerto Penasco), and in sit-down restaurants.  I LOVE the red hot sauce and along with the re-fried beans, I pretty much can tell if they know what they are doing.    Try the red sauce.  It's hot, smooth, and DOES NOT have chunks of tomato in it.  It has tons of dried chile (ground, but with seeds visible), vinegar and other spices.  So good with chips (of course), but EXCELLENT on anything on your plate.  Take some \"to go\" and put it on your cheese omelet the next morning.  You'll come back here to thank me!  The food is solid here, old school, along with excellent shredded beef tacos, tostadas, etc.  But for me, the FIFTH STAR goes to the RED CHILE SALSA!!!!",

Some really cute kids dressed in costumes came up to do some traditional (they seemed that way to this gringa anyway) Mexican dances.  That was probably the best part.  I judge a Mexican restaurant by its salsa...first disappointment.  It tasted like they had dumped Pace into a bowl.  I could have stayed home for that.  I had the fish tacos for dinner.  Sadly these were also crummy...perhaps I was spoiled after living in Los Angeles for six years...home to some GREAT fish tacos.

It is the oldest Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale, and it is named after the olive trees that used to grow in fields around its grounds years ago.  My husband and I went here on the suggestion of some locals who highly recommended it. The menu is large, but unfortunately does not have carnitas or mole on it. Instead of our favorites, we opted for a meal of carne asada steak and a chile relleno with rice and beans. The salsa served with the chips was good, but served in a carafe. I didn't get this, it would have been easier for it to just have been put in bowls. The chips did not seem fresh, either. However, the tortillas served with my husband's carne asada were home made!! This was a nice surprise. His steak was tender and tasty as well. The rice and beans were standard style. He liked the fact he was given fresh, diced green chile with his lunch, too. My chile relleno was fresh, not one taken out of a can. This made a real difference. I wish I had tried the flan, as I love this particular dessert.  Overall, this is a decent restaurant, but not the best I have been to, either. It's not a bad choice if you are in the area.",

    "text": "I recently found myself at Los Olivos for dinner and was reminded of just how great this place really is.   I have been there many times and almost always order the same thing - the mini combo. It's a mini taco, mini enchilada, mini tamale and a mini tostada served with rice and beans. A plate full of mini food! Yea! Awesome every time.   On my last visit I decided to keep it simple and just get two tacos. Full sized. I got one chicken and one beef. I had never had the chicken and was pleasantly surprised when I took my first bite and discovered it was fried chicken! In a taco! Score.  Whether you like chicken or beef (or I think they might have shrimp) the tacos at Los Olivos are the best tacos in town, hands down.  And to top it off they have really good chips and salsa, which to me can make or break a place.  The other great thing about this place is the first room as you walk into the seating area. It looks like what a mexican hobbit hut might look like. Totally cool.",

(Props to my bro for pointing it out) and their Chile Relleno is awesome.  The atmosphere is cool and weird, it's right next to SMoCA and it's still family owned and operated.  Also, step off the salsa.  The salsa fresca in the little caraffe.. you know the one with piles of fresh tomatoes and cilantro and onions and peppers?  It rocks my world.  It's not the only salsa that makes my tongue do the Snoopy dance, but it's certainly one of them.  The service isn't always fabulous but it's never been bad.  I admit the first time I went here I wasn't overly impressed.  It turns out I ordered badly.  The trick to enjoying this place is to get one of the dishes they do well.  For me that's the shredded beef chimi, the chille relleno and cheese enchiladas in that order.",

This place has a huge room with a bandstand, live music and dance floor. It's pretty cool.  Unfortunately, the food isn't as cool.  It's pretty run-of-the-mill Mexican food. Definitely nothing to write home about. Or rave on Yelp about.   So save yer money and head over to Frank and Lupe's.  But get a pitcher of strawberry margaritas to go at Los Olivos first--the margaritas at F&L suck.  P.S. I really wanted to give Los Olivos 2 1/2 stars, but g-damn Yelp doesn't have a button for that. . .  Update: screw Frank & Lupe's --they suck too. Save up some money and go to Los Sombreros--great food & great strawberry margs.",

I want to give them four really bad but as many other reviews indicate, their food is completely, utterly average and the margaritas that I've had are more like a freez-e-pop on the rocks than a strong, south of the border cocktail.  I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the guy to go to when you're curious if a drink is strong - it takes a lot for me to make a face and ask for more mixer.  That being said, on our dangerous and exciting skateboard margarita tour, Chris R and I asked the camarero to pour some more tequila in there.  He begrudgingly obliged, but that just brought it to a normal margo level.  I've had the fajitas which were good, and the chicken enchiladas which were amazingly average - at least for the prices which are dangerously similar to a certain competing restaurant 1.5 miles south on Scottsdale Road.  Los Olivos could win me over.  The staff is so warm and accommodating and I really like the old school, 'break from Fox Restaurant Concepts' atmosphere.  I'd say give it a shot - this is one of the most bitterly divided set of reviews I've seen!",

The decor is festive and the some of the waitstaff appear to have been working there forever.  First of all, they serve two distinct salsas.  I am not a fan of the enchilada type hot sauce, which is an Arizona thing, but the other salsa is fresh and full of onions, tomato and cilantro.  It tastes as though it is made right before it is brought to the table...so fresh.  We had to ask for a bowl for the salsa, which is apparently not normal at Los Olivos, but we were making a mess trying to use our little plates for the chips and salsa.   I ordered a combo plate and my husband ordered the enchiladas.  The flavor was delicious and much like Tex-Mex, which is my favorite.  The margaritas were also great.  The prices are reasonable and truly, this is the best Mexican food I have found in Arizona.  They offer fajita meat dishes, which is a rarity.    Los Olivos was packed at 6:30pm when we grabbed dinner and we quickly learned why.  It has been around for decades and has earned a reputation for great Mexican food.",

She brought a styrofoam cup with lid and straw for him and was very careful to warm me of the hot plate when the food came. Her bright and cheery personality made me feel welcome which doesn't always happen when dining out with a hungry toddler! The bus boy was amazing as well. He made sure we had a constant supply of salsa which I loved as well as my son! Seriously amazing fresh salsa. Even as I was leaving, the hostess helped me carry my leftovers and opened the door for me. It is so wonderful to find a family-friendly restaurant.

My friend Bev brought me here for lunch one day because we were craving beer and a good salad and it has quickly become a favorite.    Thier chips and salsa are so, so delicious and I'm really picky about chips and salsa.  The chips are nice and thin and arrive hot and the salsa is fresh and just a little bit spicy.  Their margaritas are top notch (my husband always gets the Cadillac) and many claim that their's are the best in the valley.  I don't know if that's True, but they're damn good.  Now my husband is a huge fan of their Pollo a la Queso Crema.  It's a flour tortilla stuffed with chicken, deep fried (like a chimichanga and topped with seasoned cream cheese & melted cheeses.  You'll be my new BFF if you'll go halfsies with me on their topopo salad and mini beef tacos.  So yummy.  The topopo salad salad is a regular green salad tossed with the yuumiest vinaigrette then topped with mixed veggies and then chicken, slices of avacado, pickled jalapenos, tomatoes, cheddar cheese and topped with cottage cheese stuffed tomato.  And the best part:  It's sitting on a tostada covered in a thin layer of guacamole!  I know it doesn't sound that exciting or even that unusal, but it is so damn good.  Like I said, I'm not a big Mexican food addict, but I crave this place all the time.  Thier food is always really good, very fresh and never fails to please.",

    "text": "There was a time in Scottsdale when its citizens roamed free, able to go out without being hunted by cougars, or come face to face with D-bags and 30K Millionaires. It was a peaceful place, where the majority of people engaged in simple crafts like weaving cotton and forging horseshoes. And it was into this community that the prescient Corrall family came, making there way north from the Mexican state of Sonora in 1919. They built an adobe structure on the outskirts of town under olive trees which was used for many purposes. Obviously aware that Scottsdale would burgeon into a world-class resort town, the family decided to open a restaurant to serve traditional Mexican cuisine and capitalize on the growing popularity of things like Cheech Marin and ponchos.  Today, however, someone walking into the \"Patio\" will likely say to himself or herself: \"This is probably going to be like eating at Acapulco\". And unfortunately nothing could be farther from the truth. Los Olivos is described as an \"institution\" but you'd never guess by that reputation how low the ceilings are. As the Corralls expanded the property so too did it enhance the labyrinthine characteristic of the restaurant. Yet this growth is positive: I've never had to wait for a table. While I've been seated in various rooms, there isn't one that I like best. Despite reminding me a little of the Mos Eisely Cantina, it manages to stay cool and dim during the summer giving it a special allure when I first ate there.   The service is probably the most unusual you will find in Scottsdale. You will find no pushiness here, you will also find lots of bilingual servers who can handle your order in both Spanish and English. And yes, because it's been around forever some of the servers have been too. They may seem a little distant, but it's only because this is one of those places in the 'dale that caters to the whole city and as such has a very diverse clientele.  Undoubtedly you'll notice that like Acapulco, Los Olivos loves to promote its fajitas and margaritas. But the fact is, they do an excellent job of offering a wide variety of dishes such that you can eat here often and not have to order the same thing. Moreover they are fairly consistent in keeping the menu Sonoran in focus. This will sound pedestrian, until you realize that Mexican cuisine suffers the same image problem that Chinese does. Namely when only certain areas of the country could immigrate, they had a disproportionate impact on how the cuisine was represented in the U.S. And so the Patio sticks mainly to beef and some chicken with only a few plates using seafood.   This is also one of the places biggest complaints: that this authentic Sonoran food is as bland as a telenovela adapted for American TV. But this is actually why you know you it's not Margarita Monday: US chains are known to add such high level of sugar to recipes as to make dishes artificially sweet. The food here is not sweet at all, and hence good news for your pre-diabetes, but bad news for your craven palette. (European tourists take note, disregard these comments.)  Yet I found myself going to Los Olivos in the first place because of the price. Yes, this is an affordable restaurant. Some entrees are less than $10 and give one an economical choice amidst the orgy of maxed out credit cards in Old Town. Parking is also free and convenient because it is adjacent to a large, city-owned structure for the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art.  Perhaps the greatest irony with is that the once trendsetting Corrals are portrayed today as conservative with their restaurant's image. But no matter, as Scottsdale treasures its history as much as being hip. So Los Olivos remains a good bet if you're looking for something staid. And if you are not, there's always Cowboy Ciao.",

We had a reservation for ten people and the table wasn't ready for about thirty minutes.  Not ideal.    We decided to pass the time by having a drink in the bar area.  My red sangria tasted like wine and cranberry juice and didn't have any of the lovely fruit chunks I was hoping for, just a single maraschino cherry.  It was kind of pathetic.  Once we finally got our table, things started looking up.  The chips and salsa weren't bad.  However, even the milder of the salsas was a bit too hot for some people at the table.  Before heading over to the restaurant that night, I'd consulted Yelp just to see if there was something redeeming that I'd missed on my previous visit to Los Olivos.  Holly R. mentioned getting the Mini Combo every time and it sounded interesting so I decided to try it.   This little combo really does have it all - mini taco, enchilada, tamale, rice, and beans, along with a boatload of cheese.  Thankfully I was able to get the green corn tamale instead of pork.    Others at the table seemed please with their selections.  Still, there are definitely better Mexican places around.  The service was a bit slow and I found the atmosphere dark and depressing.",

Wait was not too long, but long enough. Service was ok, but not great, pitcher of Margarita tasted good but was $36 and we only got kiddie size glasses for it. Food was pretty good, but not superb. Chips and salsa WERE real good. All in all not totally gratifying experience, unfortunately. Perhaps, i will bump up my rating after next visit.  \"It's alright\"  Eugene",

I'd definitely go back if I was in the area, and just get something other than the chicken.",

Love the authentic feel.. there's already too many 'new' places in Scottsdale, we don't need another.  Hated the salsa served in a carafe to pour on a plate!  Who thought that would be enjoyable?!!  A Mexican restaurant with only three margaritas on the menu?  Where's the silver coin?  Loved the food and great service!!",

They have a legit chili con queso (especially the one with chorizo too).  Think creamy velvetta cheese with chilis chopped up in there.  It is pure cheese heaven.  The food doesn't blow you away, but you can find some servicable choices that you will be satisfied with.  There is a shrimp in garlic sauce that is served with a guacamole salad that is really good.  You can enjoy some good guacamole with chips and finish off the rest with the salad.",

I was away from my computer and could not access reviews, instead trusting the bartender at the Phoenician on his word alone when he said Los Olivos would be a must. So, off we went!  After getting what could quite possibly have been the worst customer service from a couple of 16 year old girls my fiance thought \"psh, weren't even Mexican\", I later sat munching on my mediocre tacos with my head down and my ego bruised.  Did the bartender hate us?  Was this a joke that they play on unsuspecting tourists?  Maybe he grew up in some form of religious cult in Maine that didn't allow him to have Mexican food EVER, and now he ESCAPED to Scottsdale where he found a safe hiding place, discovered Los Olivos, and has made it his mission to inspire all of us to eat the #5 as much as possible.  I didn't get sick, but my heart...my heart...it hurts.",

    "text": "Although it is not my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley, Los Olivos is definitely my first choice for Mexican food in Old Town Scottsdale. The building itself has unique architecture (although it would be nice if they didn't need a sign that asks people not to climb on it) and according to the menu, a great deal of history. The location is also great, being in close proximity to Old Town Shopping and the Scottsdale Civic Center Mall. Further, the first time I went to Los Olivos, there was a mariachi band playing in the dining room.  What I am forgetting in this review... oh yes... food!  The meal starts with two varieties of salsa and a basket of warm tortilla chips. I was pleased to find that the hot salsa was actually hot. I've tried the enchiladas and the burro (which is definitely not a burrito) and while both were tasty, I didn't find either to be anything special. One thing that did stand out to me was the Mexican style rice served with both dishes. I can't think of any better way to describe it than to say they got it \"right\". I could go on about the number of franchised Mexican and southwestern restaurants I've been to that screw up this basic side.  The prices and portions are reasonable, although with a group of five, all wanting to pay with plastic, it was frustrating that they weren't willing to split the check (and there was a sign posted stating this).",

The enchiladas came smothered in cheese (good!) but the red sauce they were gooped in was so oily I couldn't stomach even one out of two. And the oiliness didn't stop there. Even the \"authentic\" Spanish rice was practically deep fried in oil. Though it's True you can actually taste the tomatoes in the rice which is the truly authentic way to make this dish, the amount of oil in it made it slip right off my fork each time. Oh, and the salsas that everyone else seemed to like came in two varieties, 1. sweet and chunky but completely devoid of cilantro or onions and 2. pureed with a hint of spice, still no cilantro and not worthy of being called \"hot\" like the waiter did when he set it down on the table.   It's too bad this place didn't live up to the reviews because the building and atmosphere were definitely unique and sets you up to have a good time. One positive I can say is that their blue agave margaritas went down smooth and tasty!",

One guy in our party ordered the Caesar with chicken with the dressing on the side. It came out wrong and when by the time it was replaced the rest of us were long done with our entrees. Oh yeah.

Unfortunately, there was a paper towel or something of the sort baked into the Crema. Everyone makes mistakes but the way the manager, Ruby, handled the situation is why I will not be returning. Instead of apologizing, she told me they don't have that type of paper towel in the kitchen and started pondering what it could be. I told her I wasn't interested in what it was as it clearly wasn't food. She snapped back that I would be getting a credit. After five more minutes waiting at the counter, she finally returned to tell me their internet was down and she could fax me a receipt. I told her I would prefer a cash refund. She agreed but then took my credit card and wrote my confidential credit card info on a piece of paper asking me to sign it saying I wouldn't stop the payment. I told her I was not going to leave my confidential information just lying around on a piece of paper. She was incredibly annoyed and put a line through the numbers and again asked me to sign. I again told her she could not keep my confidential info so she scribbled out the numbers more. I finally gave up and took my money. I will never go back even though it was a childhood favorite. Buyer beware! Hopefully you don't also get a paper towel chimichanga!",

All the tacos were covered in grated cabbage and accompanied by day old pico-de-gallo with some weird creamy stuff on top. I have no idea what keeps this joint going, except that if you are drunk with margaritas, then probably anything tastes OK. Guys, the '70's restaurant model needs to be revamped...Either you play the \"retro\" food thing or you actually serve decent food. The chips were good, and the salsa was decent. Prices are too high.   With the proximity to Mexico and a healthy Mexican American population, this restaurant has no reason to serve this kind of food. Underwhelmed, for sure.",

    "text": "Los Olivos is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the valley. If you are truly Mexican or were fed by one than you know exactly what authentic Mexican tastes like. I know some people are used to that southwestern food some like to try and pass as Mexican so that is what their expected tastes are. If you think Chipotle is Mexican food than I would see why you would give a mediocre review for Los Olivos. Personally I think places like Chipotle are disgusting because of my taste for REAL Mexican but that's a whole other review. :)    I have always been treated well here and I have been going for years. My Tata (Grandfather) was a Mariachi player who's band played at this restaurant back when it opened so I love it when I see Mariachi there..it reminds me of him. The food tastes exactly how I expect it to taste.. DELICIOUS and just like homemade. The prices are very reasonable to me and the restaurant itself is cozy. Also, the Strawberry Margarita I had was so sweet and smooth I could have drank them like Kool-aid! :p  My favorites are their Tortilla Soup and Green Chicken Enchiladas but recently I think they changed cooks because the recipe for the Tortilla Soup isn't the same. No worries though because it's still good! I will always come back here. I would have gave them 5 stars but i'm afraid even though the food is good it's not as good as Comedor Guadalajara but Los Olivos is better in location and atmosphere. Both restaurants are the same in rating for me..just for different reasons.",

I've been coming here since I was small and it is one of my favorites in the valley. It's not only a local institution, but one that remains well loved by its patrons. Great for lunch or dinner- I've had multiple parties here too. It's the best Mexican food in Scottsdale and among the best in the Valley (if not THE best...depends what I'm hungry for). Come and enjoy amazing Sonoran Mexican food",

She reappeared a couple of minutes later and still with no greeting ask us if it were just the two of us. She picked up two menus and then told us to follow her. She paraded us through several rooms without a word, and then again, without a word.....headed  back towards the main entrance leaving us standing in the middle of a large dining area.  I just happened to notice that she no longer had the menus in her hand....so we wandered back through the rooms and found two menus laying on a table!!! So began our dining experience....and it really didn't get much better! I ordered the Sopes which says it comes with lettuce, tomatoes & olives - but take a close look at the photo I posted.....you may be able to find the two pieces of tomato, but you would have more luck searching for Waldo than to find the one olive they put on my plate! That one little olive tasted like it had been in an open can in the refrigerator for three weeks - I took one bite and couldn't even eat it! OLIVE is part of their name - I rest my case!!!!  By ALL means....if you are hungry - RUN for the border....run to Taco Bell....run anywhere but here!!!!!!!",

I had a chicken enchilada and beef taco combo plate and it was fantastic!  I've been missing real tacos and real Mexican food since I moved to Phoenix from Santa Fe and finally found it!    We also got the queso dip and quacamole. Both were fresh and clearly made with fresh ingredients.   The salsas were also fresh and really good however, I wish the \"hot\" was much hotter. I asked about that and apparently the reason you can't get hot salsa in the Phoenix valley is because the locals don't like it. Anyway. Both salsas had a great flavor. I could have just eaten the chips (also fresh) salsa guacamole and queso and been satisfied. But nooooo!  I had to go and order a meal!  Man!  I was stuffed.   Even the ice tea was good!    Our server, Toni, was a sheer joy and she made our visit even more pleasant!  She's a very positive person and an asset to the establishment.   My only wish is that I could have had a sopapilla and honey to finish. But I was stuffed anyway. So...    \"Family owned since 1947\". Here's hoping they're around another 70 years!!",

I had the pork steak and it was done very good, moist juicy, with a really nice spice rub on it. Lots of food for the price. Salsa Fresca, Beans, Rice and tortilla. House Margarita was just so so.

Chips and salsa were great, but it all went down hill from there. The margaritas were really limey and the food was pretty blah. We kept trying to give positives but it was a challenge. The staff was really nice.",

Their sopaipillas are dynamite for dessert as well.  If you're up by the one on 101 / FLW it's rarely busy which has always been odd.  I guess not being a chain with a chain's advertising budget people simply don't know much about them. Their food is far far better than any chain however.",

    "text": "Although the atmosphere here is quaint with its live mariachi band, the guy with the rose bucket coming around, and the dim lighting, the food is just...meh.  I went here on the recommendation of a friend I was with and had brought some out-of-town guests here for dinner one night, and I kind of wish I hadn't.  First off, I walk in, and the hostess asks how many people are in my party, so I tell her four, and she says to hold on and leaves.  I thought maybe she was getting menus or whatever, but no.  I'm waiting and waiting, and then, I look over and see her standing at a different hostess desk.  Um...hello.  I thought you were getting me a table.  I'm not really sure what her purpose was cuz the entrance was getting full, and she just stood there.  Finally, an older manager-ish man came out, saw the people, and got another girl to start seating people.    Once seated, I started to peruse the menu.  There was some Los Olivos special on there, and I was really confused by it because it was really a sour cream-filled enchilada with some cheese on top for $11.  Really?  I could make that myself for roughly $4.  I ended up getting a combination of 1 chicken and 1 beef enchilada, but I couldn't really tell the difference when it came out since it was all kind of hidden under a ton of melted cheese.  When a stranger at the next table asked what was good here, one of my out-of-town guests was like, It doesn't really matter what you get if you get a special because it all kind of comes as one mess on a plate.  That might sound enticing to some of you out there, but I promise you, it's not messy in an awesome way.  It all had the same texture and taste, and I wasn't even sure what that texture and taste was really.  It was kind of awkward, actually.  Afterward, my friend who suggested the place was like, I swear it was better last time I came, but for some reason, it wasn't good today.  He even went so far to say that if he were a Yelp!er, he'd have given the place three stars.  I, however, am giving it two because, really, I've had much better Mexican food around these parts with better parking, better chips and dip, and better everything.  Kind of disappointed in you, Los Olivos.  PS: If you do decide to go here and try it out, know that they DO NOT split checks.",

And yes the food  is cheesy , fried , spicy  and maybe even a tad bit greasy  but if  you wanna say to hell with calorie counting  and carb cutting  for a day and experience mexican food the way it should be , this is definately worth trying out!  Oh and the shredded beef tacos? Delicious!",

The salsa is standard, but the hot sauce is delicious and I crave it (I live in SD so I don't get to Los as much as I used to).    Their cheese crisp is also a treat.  They do it right there with fresh tortillas and a crunch instead of the flimsy crap other mexican food restaurants try to sling at ya.    I will say that it's standard catering to the gringo masses mexican food, but it at least has more flavor than other bland restaurants I've been to (I have yet to find a decent mexican food place in SD)  I LOVE their shredded beef taco.  That's all I ever order.  I also love the restaurant itself.  I would recommend to those looking for decent mexican food in a nice atmosphere.

Then a server refills my ice tea and I got was mostly ice, further diluting my drink. The waiter who gave me the sour cream kept walking by my table with a smirk on his face.

Don't get me wrong though. It's not bad, but I've had better Mexican food up here in Northern Cali.   If I had to grade the food, I'd give it a C+. Just about average. In my opinion, the food was missing some salt and a little spice. Because this restaurant gets a lot of tourists, I think they toned down the flavors. I guess they figure it's better to be under spiced than over. They've got a great variety of chicken, seafood, and beef dishes. Combination plates make it easy to try a couple different menu items. I had a combo plate with two chicken enchiladas. It was okay.  The rice was decent. It had a predominate onion flavor to it, which I found a little off putting after awhile. Their chips were great. Thin, crispy, and sprinkled with just enough salt.   For a weekday night, it was jam packed. It was pretty loud and difficult to have a conversation. Service didn't suffer because of the crowd. My table was attended to promptly and we got our food in a reasonable amount of time. Everything was on the pricey side. Not outrageous, but I was still a little surprised when we got the bill.  If a lived in the area I might (a very weak might) try Los Olivos again.",

We had to ask for chip refills but the salsa didn't get refilled. I kind of think those go hand in hand...but maybe I'm just too demanding for a Mexican restaurant haha! My food in particular was disappointing. We work nearby so this is one of those nostalgic places that we always come to. I think $30 for a pitcher of watered down margarita is a ripoff. It is also relatively annoying to be looking for your server and seeing her eating while we are waiting for her. If you have a group of nine, it makes sense to clarify if the tab will be split right? Not hand us a $200 bill and expect us to figure it out with 9 credit cards and the bill not separated. I had to write names next to orders to get her to split it correctly. Needless to say, that took a ridiculous time to sort out.I get it, it is a mom & pops kind of a place...",

    "text": "I don't even know where to start with this review except to say that this is, hands down, the worst restaurant experience I have had since I moved to Scottsdale a year and a half ago.  A friend planned a post-work happy hour here with a large group of friends (7 total), with most of us arriving around 5:30PM. Before being seated, as we arrived a little early, my boyfriend and I found seats after the bar. After a short wait, the bartender came over and served us each a Corona, which was the only reason this place got a star at all.  Once our friends arrived, we were seated in a large booth with an adjoining table. Our waitress was kind, but ineffective at her job. Repeatedly, she walked away from our table mid-sentence or once we'd asked to order. Being new to Los Olivos, I decided to stick with a relatively safe entree: nachos with chicken. She asked me if I'd like to add guac and sour cream and when I said \"sure\", she informed me that each item was a THREE DOLLAR upcharge, and that the basic nachos (cheese, jalapenos) with chicken were $14.95, meaning the resultant nachos with guac were going to be almost $18!! When I saw a menu and realized that only cheese and jalapenos were on the nachos, I called her back over and asked to cancel the order altogether so that I could get something else. She said that they were already done and she would charge me $15.95 with the guac because \"some of the prices in the computer are wrong\". Okay, I ordered them, they're nachos, how bad can they be, right?  Wrong. Ten minutes after she told me that they were done, they came out with the rest of the food. The base chips were greasy and covered with what appeared to be dried up shredded cheese, melted 10-15 minutes ago. You couldn't even get a chip without it breaking off from the baked-on cheese. The chicken was dry, and had no moisture. Yes, the portion was large, but that doesn't matter when the food is inedible. I -never- send food back or refuse to eat it (seriously, I could probably count on one hand the number of times that's ever happened to me in my life) and I -LOVE- nachos... but these were terrible. The entire rest of the table shook their heads in apology, and even when I offered them up, no one else wanted any.  At the end of our meal, I approached the ticket counter to pay and told the young girl there \"Look... I ordered these, so I'll pay for them. But you need to know... those chicken nachos...\", then she finished my sentence \"Were terrible? Yeah, I know... They're bad! You should try something else next time!\" I said \"I'm just going to be honest, there's not going to be a next time here. This was really, really bad.\" She took my card and ran it (for $20, with the automatic gratuity) and told me to have a nice day. No apology, no offer to let me speak to the manager to at least make them aware of the food quality... just an acceptance that she KNEW they were awful and then swiping my card.  So, that's it for Los Olivos. They're my first one star review, and I have to tip my hat to them because they really earned it. The rest of our table all had reasonable experiences, but this was enough to turn me off of them for good. (Except their tiny $20 margarita pitchers... which the entire table thought was a rip off. $27, if you want strawberry.) Save yourself the trouble, go to Dos Gringos, Loco Patron, or any of the much better places with decent service to boot. At least they take decent care of their customers and will care about the experience.",

    "text": "We went here for my father's birthday. I really want to like this place. It was one of our favorite places when we moved to the area in 2003. Sadly, the overall ambiance and quality has gone downhill.  THE GOOD - The salsas were all very good and very fresh. Our waitress, Toni, was really wonderful. She has been there for decades, and her husband is part of the Corral family that owns the place. My wife got the chimichanga and she enjoyed it, although she didn't care much for the rice. My mom liked her chicken quesadilla. My dad got a fried ice cream for his birthday, that was also good. The excellent service and welcoming disposition deserved and got a 20% tip.  THE BAD - There was a hair in my salsa. The salsa itself was great, but the hair was a bummer. I ordered the fish tacos, and when they came, the fish smell was as fragrant as the funkiest clambake. Now I love sushi, and I have a couple of pounds of ceviche in my fridge. I made my peace with fish. But when it smells, well, I can't eat it. The texture was tough to the fork, too. I was sad, but I had to send it back. I dislike being a pain and sending stuff back. I was once a waiter, too, and I never want to be THAT customer to my wait staff. I ended up having a vegetarian burrito that was okay, but inside was a 1-inch-long woody stem. I usually love rice, but the rice here seemed overcooked, dry and with an oily aftertaste. It was likely in hot holding for quite some time.  In conclusion, this used to be a beautiful place. It still is, but it has been neglected. A little paint would go a long way. Some dishes could use a little more care. In spite of the variability with the food, the service was good, and I would love to see Los Olivos back to its former glory.",

Most people that I go to Los Olivos is my family and they all are rather picky about their Mexican food and they love all of their meals they have ever gotten at Los Olivos while oddly enough for me the best meal I have ever had at Los Olivos is actually a Burger yes you read right a Burger with an amazing kind of like a enchilada sauce mixed with something else I can't tell what it is and grilled to perfection and their fries are perfectly golden brown with a crunch that will blow your mind and make you wonder what other hidden gems there is throughout the world where you never thought they could be especially with food.  Personally I just can't get enough of their hot sauce and chips always freshly made and usually you have to wait about 4 minutes before eating the chips because they are to hot to eat. That just tells you how fresh they are and the chips are just salted so perfectly that it intensifies the flavor magnificently.",

Do you follow, do you stay??? Who knows.   Don't bother getting a beverage from the bar. Watered down waste of money.   We've NEVER had a server that has been happy to be there. They walk around like they'd rather be having their eyelids tattooed.   The food is meh at best. 20 years ago when the family was running this restaurant it was good. The service was impeccable.

Bonus: EXTREMELY loud with \"crowded ambiance\", along with such slow service that makes you think they forgot about you.   Also:  the host decided to ridicule my last name to a fellow worker (before announcing it) - even though he was standing RIGHT next to me!  Felt humiliated!

It's not bad, it just isn't anything that makes me say, man I love this place or NEED to return to Los Olivos.   The location is great, in downtown Scottsdale, they have parking for the restaurant, the atmosphere is great, service is fantastic and fast.   If you have limited time for lunch and it's close it isn't \"bad\" you can definitely grab a quick bite but Taco Bell is just as good, in fact taste wise I actually prefer Taco Bell over Los Olivos.... I wish it weren't so but unfortunately that's just the way it is.",

I ate here on August 5, 2011 for lunch with a friend. The place has not changed except for they did remodel the bathrooms. The bar and entire restaurant is still the same. I had a green chile tamale and tried a cheese enchilada again. My enchilada was very hot inside not cold and the green corn tamale was pretty good as well. The reason why I gave them only 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is because the staff is not friendly at all. It was almost like they were bothered that they had to work. If the staff was friendly and not bordering rude they would of earned 4 stars.",

We asked a shop owner for a great mexican restaurant and he recommended this one, and we're so glad we did. The salsa was BY FAR the freshest I've ever had. You could smell the ripe tomatoes. The carafes didn't bother me - I thought it was a great idea, so you didn't have to worry about double dipping with friends; they provide you with a plate to scoop up your own serving.   I had the steak Tacos Al Carbon - the meat was so tender and tasted like it had just come off a charcoal grill. The rice was the most flavorful I've ever tasted. My friends had a veggie enchilada which looked great, even though I'm not a vegetarian, and a combo platter which I was a little jealous of - looked like a perfect selection! I went back a second time before leaving Arizona, and got the green corn tamale, which was incredible!  The service was Superman fast! Usually you get bored with chips and salsa before they bring your entree but here, I had barely dug into the chips before I got my entree!  I honestly can't think of a bad thing about this place!",

The decor was a bunch of painted wall murals, I think very typical of what I've seen at other Mexican joints.  I did have an interesting take on a chile relleno... 'Spicy Chicken Poblano' poblano chili pepper stuffed with spicy chicken, dipped in egg batter, then deep fried and topped with a delicious vegetable tomato sauce served with rice and beans.  Although, once I again i was decieved by the word \"spicy\" as this had no kick to it... it's what I typically call \"white man spicy.\"   Anyways, it's decent enough, but nothing that makes me think \"man I need to go back\"",

If you like a little spice in your life, this is the dish for you. The creaminess of the melty cream cheese, along with the crunch of the chimi is to die for.   The chips and salsa are my fav in AZ, crispy thin chips and a great trick someone taught me was to mix the hot and mild salsas together.   The family that owns it is always friendly and Veronica, the bartender, mixes up some the best drinks in town, including my fav a michelada (beer, lime juice and I hold the clamato).  This is always a MUST DO when I come home to Scottsdale.  I'm a huge fan of both locations and it's great for groups.  I've also ordered their app platters for parties, which is always a big hit.",

It's missing a star because the last time I was there- I got stale chips =(   and the fact that there's not enough meat in my food- I order a carne asada steak and only a tiny piece came. =(  Onto positive things!   I had my quarter century dinner here- I'm personally not a fan of Mexican food.  However! I really like Los Olivos becaue they make everything fantastico. There were about twenty of us there and everyone clean their plates and glass- pretty much all of their chimichangas were really good.  We kept ordering pitchers of the lime margaritas- I love it so much I'm tempted to change this to five stars.   The drinks kept flowing.  I really like carne asada so everytime I'm there, it's something meaty.  One time there was thres amigos performing for my party, Guantanameras!!! i love Latin music so it was very suitable and added to the good time we were already having.  Another time, there were latin dancing, and I was having a blast getting my Latin groove on before hitting the club. If you're a Latin entertainment lover, then come on a Friday or Saturday night, you will have such a great time at this place. I also like the architecture and the interior designs of the restaurant.  It's pretty awesome!  The manager also come out and party with my party and our server was so sweet!   I am thinking of having another birthday there! =D",

Once I saw that someone compared Los Olivos to La Pinata in Burlingame, CA, I was going to try it. I grew up eating at La Pinata & have missed it for years. While the food was not La Pinata (& after 10 years, I may have built it up so much that nothing ever is) the food was excellent but the service was even better. I had a shrimp chimi that was delicious, but I have to rave about the wait staff. I had my two small dogs with me & my friend can't be in the sun. The staff set up umbrellas special so that we could eat outside without being in the sun. They also brought my dogs water and didn't bat an eyelash when I asked for a grilled chicken breast without anything for my dogs. My dogs are really well behaved & sat on their chair the whole time without making a fuss, but the fact that the staff at Los Olivos was kind to them without making a fuss & disrupting the conversation was priceless. I will be back. Probably tomorrow.",

What a disappointment it was!  The steak fajitas came out and they were served as a pile of mostly onions and some green peppers.  There was hardly any steak in the pile and what I did find had very little seasoning and was tough, definitely not top sirloin! We were also served chips and salsa  which were OK, nothing special. Since we were still hungry after eating the fajitas, we ordered sopapillas. They came out and again what a disappointment! Hardly any flavor to them and very little sugar coating on the outside. The honey syrup didn't come in a serving decanter but instead in cheap peel open packages you would find at a fast food restaurant. As I looked around i thought the only people that would eat here are tourists(who will never come back) and people who don't know what authentic mexican food tastes like.",

The large open area near the bar fit us easily and the tables were set up thoughtfully to allow us to be together in a group but in such a way that it was easy to get up and move around. Food was excellent, and the servers were right on top of things all the way around from getting drinks served to bringing out everyone's food at the same time, and efficiently handling the separate checks without any of the confusion that so often accompanies dining in large groups. Well done!!!",

    "text": "Should be 2.5 stars... Their chips and salsa, delish. I die. every time. The pollo queso something something...yummmm, so greasy and cheesy and spicy and chickeny and fried  $4 dollar margaritas? ok! The food here is typical yummy greasy Arizona Mexican food. It's nothing extraordinary, but it isn't terrible. What's terrible about this place is the service. Yikes! Every time I come here I am first ignored by the depressed 19 year old side bang lip pierced hostess. She really never makes an effort to say hello. I feel I need to overcompensate for the brattiness she exudes by being overly nice. Hello? I'm on the opposite side of the hostess podium, do your job biotch.  We are often sat at some odd random table, on our most recent visit being one with 2 or so extra chairs, that also doubled as the iced tea, water, and to go container station. I think it's best if you come here with large groups for this reason. They seem to reserve all the \"nice\" tables for them. Our waitress is usually a moody 40 something woman, that acts like everything she does for you is a favor. Literally, the waiters and waitresses here don't even bring your food, drinks, take your plates, etc. Now the men that do all this, I like. They're friendly, and helpful! I think it's a large extended family that still owns and operates this place. Which is most likely why the service sucks so much.  I still occasionally eat here, as my boyfriend loves the food, but the service needs some upgrading. If this wasn't such a tourist trap this place would have gone out of business long long ago",

    "text": "I know I give more four star reviews of establishments than I probably should, and I'm trying to break myself of the habit, but Los Olivos deserves a solid four stars in my book.  Like others have said, the food isn't over-the-top amazing, but its solid Mexican and its solid consistent.  I've had enchiladas (fantastic), fajitas (fantastic), and multiple times, the guacamole (fantastic).    What is over-the-top is the architecture, the character, and the somewhat-rustic feel to the slightly-wacky dining room(s).  While it is not completely clear from the exterior of the Los Olivos structure, the interior reveals a Xanadu of sorts, no ceiling angle alike, no wall length perpendicular to another.  Floor tiles show signs of decades of foot traffic, and chairs reveal evidence of many meals enjoyed.  In a town where most establishments are half the age of your favorite pair of jeans, I find the comfort of Los Olivos to put me at ease.  On the weekends make sure to arrive early, or you will be asked to wait for what could be more than an hour, and its not a comfortable place to sit and have a drink while waiting, so plan accordingly.  If you like Mariachi music, give them a call ahead of time and find out when the strumming goes down.  My last time there the band set up within arms length of our table, and while some might have found this to be annoyingly distracting, my party used it as a great excuse to kill the small talk and let the guitars, vocal chords, and flavours do the talking...  Los Olivos = Love the Place.  Mexican Food = I would marry it if I could.",

    "text": "Alright, let's get one thing straight, when one thinks of \"REAL\" mexican food, it isn't the boring and bland stuff you find at chipotle and baja fresh. The reason why Mexicans are so fat is because really Mexican food is fat, greasy and definitely full of lard (I'm Mexican so I can say that!)  That being said, this place TOTALLY DELIVERS! The food was very authentic, tasty and flavorful. I actually went two times this weekend. First of all, the chips and salsa are AMAZING. They give you two kinds of salsa, mild and hot. I only wish that they gave you bowls to put them in, instead of putting it on a flat plate.  We also ordered a side of guacamole, which I thought was very good.   Some of the other reviews have said you can't make modifications to your order, but that is not True. I asked for no onions in my enchiladas and they were happy to do that. The tamale was good and so what my shredded beef taco. Having that big side of guacamole definitely spices up the tacos!  They also have lunch specials until 4pm everyday!! They also have a decent happy hour (I've heard) and their beers are pretty cheap. I always love a place that has Dos Equis on draft.",

    "text": "We used to be occasional happy customers, for probably the past 20 years or so, but had not been to Los Olivos for quite some time. Thought we would try it again.  We have been there in the past, this time of year, when you had to wait for a table. The place was not busy. What a disappointing dining experience this was. Upon entering we were rudely asked if we wanted the bar, or a table.....by someone I assume was part of the family. He looked like he was dressed to go work out at the gym. I asked for a table. We followed him to the dining room where he threw 2  menus on the table and left. Our server...an older woman that I'm sure has been there for many years....arrived, and asked if we wanted anything to drink. I ordered soda. My Hubby ordered a beer. She said someone would bring chips, salsa, water, and soda.  That person, the 'bus girl', I guess....was so stone faced and unfriendly...and practically grunted, when we said 'thank you'. No smile. Nothing. Just her demeanor screamed that she did not enjoy her job, and would gladly be anywhere else. The server returned with the beer. I ordered chicken chimi, with green sauce...rice and beans. Hubby asked for ground beef chimi, with red sauce....rice and beans. We finished the chips before the meal arrived. No one asked if we wanted more chips. Again, we would have paid extra for more chips. Hubby finally got the server's attention to order another beer. She forgot. He had to ask again. The food arrived. The server did not bother to ask if we wanted sour cream, or guacamole....as would be common in most Mexican restaurants. Nothing. And we would have gladly paid extra for both. Do they not understand how to 'up sell'??? Same with the beer. I was driving...so Hubby would have gladly downed three of them....it they had just offered it. This place needs some new wait staff, for sure. Or perhaps some real training. Both of the chimichangas were dry, bland, and tasteless. Hubby was trying to be nice and just eat his without comment. Finally, I admitted that my chicken chimi was just horrible. The burrito was not fried crisp, and was tough. There was not even a sliver of onion to be found, no seasoning at all. Just ground up 'chicken mush'...with absolutely no flavor. The same with the rice. The beans had a little bit of flavor...not much. Hubby confessed his chimi was also tasteless. Still no offer of another drink, more chips, nothing. The 'bus girl' cleared the plates away. The server came by and snatched the empty basket the chips had been in. Not a word.  No....'how was your dinner?'  Or....'can I get you anything else?'  Or...'would you care for another drink, more chips'?  She just disappeared. Finally, she brought  the check.  Two women standing behind the front counter were talking in Spanish, as we left. Neither one looked up,  acknowledged us, or bothered to say 'thanks for coming in', 'have a nice evening'....nothing.  We left....very disappointed. We won't go back. I don't know how they stay in business. Obviously, they just don't care about the customer anymore.",

LOL  When you sit down and get your drink order, you get 2 flavors.  I only tried the regular salsa, as I knew I wasn't going to be too keen on the chili powder based salsa - never have been, it might have been fantastic, I just don't like chili/cayenne pepper based salsas.  The salsa I did try was fantastic, but it would of been nicer if we had little bowls to pour it in to instead of having to pour it on to plates.  I ordered up the #1 combination (I think it was #1).  Basically, it was a cheese enchilada, a beef taco, and a beef tamale (with rice and beans).  I had actually made a comment during my meal that the rice was the best rice I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant...no joke!  I'll definitely be going back over there many times over since I work within walking distance!",

We came into the restaurant to find 2 high school girls at the hostess stand blabbing about God knows what. When they finally noticed us, we told them we were looking for a table for 2. \"We're pretty busy, hold on\". 5 minutes later the host led us a to a table in an empty room. Tables abound people! Strike one.  After an appropriate wait, our server arrived to take our order. \"This is our first time, any recommendations?\" I asked, \"Uhhhh, I like everything\"....Great, thanks for the info. Perusing the mostly unappetizing menu we finally settled on a couple of things and ordered. Strike two.   The food arrived, and it looked sort of appetizing. My wife had the Chicken Picado, which was pretty flavorful and delicious. I ordered, essentially, a deep fried chicken burrito covered in cheese. I made a mistake. The chicken was flavorless and the amount of cheese on the thing was pretty disgusting. I won't award a strike here, we'll call it a push.   Finally the bill arrived. WHAT THE FREAKIN HELL IS THIS!? Two drinks, two entrees, throw in a tip, and I'm walkin out of here $50 bucks lighter!? Ridiculous. A BIG strike three.   Whereas The Mission (right next door) is highfalutin, refined Mexican food done well, Los Olivos is family style, deep fried Mexican food....done poorly. With so many choices in town, I doubt I will ever return to Los Olivos. Now excuse me while I lay on the couch with a stomach ache for the rest of the evening....",

They put the salsa in little bottles, so it's really really hard to eat it. And, a lot goes to waste because it's hard to scoop it off of a flat plate. That was kinda weird, but the flavors were spot on.  Started with a sampler plate- all chicken items= chimichanga, mini tacos, flautas... chicken meat was all white, and very fresh, and cooked really well. The guac on the plate was outstanding!  Really good flavors..especially when the salsa was added to the items.  Sis had chicken enchiladas, said they were outstanding. The enchilada sauce had a nice red pepper flavor. Not spicy at all- just a wonderful deep flavor.  I had a 3 item plate- beef taco, cheese enchilada and pork tamale. The tamale was soft and creamy and cooked perfectly. The taco was delicious- the beef was shredded and really tasty. The cheese enchilada was BIG! Not the normal skinny thing that you get at some places. Everything was fresh and really good.  I should have tried something else that my regulars. I'm not from the area- but if I'm ever back, I'd order the pollo ala crema... sounded great.",

The drinks are also great! Needless to say, we love it and highly recommend!",

    "text": "Ventured to Los Olivos on a Wednesday evening after finding out about them on a happy hour app for my iphone. The happy hour specials looked good enough to try a new place in Scottsdale. Got my boyfriend to try it with me, seeing as we both have a deep love for Mexican food! When we got there we were seated promptly, and the place has a real authentic feel to it. I think it's family owned? Our waitress was not super friendly, and told me the only item on happy hour was the house margarita- no food on happy hour (so I was misinformed).   We decided to stay anyways and try it out. I had the house margarita for happy hour which ended up being $3.50 so not bad. Imagine the size of a wine glass, that's what the margarita came in basically. It tastes like an average house margarita. But no complaints, I had already figured it probably would. The chips and salsa were amazing! A chunky salsa and a hotter sauce as well; I wanted to eat the whole basket. We got a cheese crisp to start, and you can never go wrong with a cheese crisp! I ordered a shredded beef taco plate (2 beef tacos with rice and beans). The tacos were good, nothing extraordinary but I would get them again. The Spanish rice and refried beans were delicious and I was really happy with those.   Overall, the food was decent and the service was subpar. I like trying to support local and independently owned joints, but honestly for what I had I would probably just go back to macayos.",

The place is beautiful, is huge, and has lots of seating areas, a huge donkey out front (which, sadly, you can't climb) and a small outside seating area.   I ordered the Mexican Flag - a plate that has three different enchiladas; a red one, a white one, and a green one. My friends ordered the carne asada, and a tostada salad. Those two dishes looked amazing when they came out! Mine, eh, not so much.   We also had margaritas which were so delicious! They bring you chips and salsa and those were very good, too!  But back to my dish.   Why only meh? Because sadly it wasn't good! There was soooo much melted cheese on top that you could barely taste the sauce of the red enchilada. The white enchilada had so much sour cream on top I couldn't taste the cheese under. And the green enchilada had no flavor.   I was very disappointed with my dish. the other two dishes, those looked great and my friends said they were delicious. So I guess next time I'll get something else than enchiladas. But I am worried that if a Mexican restaurant can't make a good enchilada? then what would the rest of the dishes will be like?   The service was good, the drinks were good, the chips and salsa were good, the other dishes were good. Four stars!",

Love the unique adobe atmosphere; built by the family generations ago; interior with sky lights and tanks full of tropical fish, lots of room inside which extends out doors.  Crowded bar, but good service.  Chips are thin, crispy and served warm with a choice of salsa.  Preferred the hot, spicy version.

The interior is a classically Spanish style down to the burnt sepia clay tiles to the dark, cool Mission-style decor. A nice place to just wander in for some drinks, snacks, and to mellow out a bit on hot summer afternoons. Parking is free and did I mention pitchers of margaritas? They make them stiff folks!",

The Tamales and Enchiladas are out of this world.  One down side is that they start charging you for chips after basket number 2, which is a disappointment but the food is still worth it to me.   Decently priced too. I would definitely recommend anyone who loves authentic Mexican food to go here.",

Until now, at Los Olivos. It arrives with chunks of tomatoes, cucumber, and onion, slivers of cilantro, all swimming in a cool but not teeth-chattering liquid that is salted and oiled to perfection. If it were just the gazpacho I would give this place a 5.  In short the service was competent but not stellar, the smoky grilled chicken quesadilla was large and well filled with cheese with light smoky flavor. The tacos et al. were OK. The decor is dated and very casual.  The three real stand-out items were the guacamole dip, the gazpacho soup, and the chunky salsa that comes with chips at the beginning of the meal.",

We didn't like any of these dishes we tried. :( Too greasy and no good taste! We are not coming back at all!  Service was okay.",

    "text": "It 's sad. But as other reviewers have shared, this place has gone down hill in all ways. Rude staff, slower than molasses service, DIRTY, sloppy, unappealing food (that is expensive), margaritas that taste like some tangy, sour tasting kool-aid-- and if you are unlucky enough to be seated in what I call the \"after thought\" corridor, you will nearly suffocate from the lack of circulation and heat (the narrow little seating area off the main dining area). I was EMBARRASSED after having taken out of town visitors to this place. I used to always rely on this place for decent food & experience.  What a shame it is to watch what used to be a valley destination go to complete waste. 1/18 UPDATE: I have added 2 more stars because it looks like they have gotten it together. I hope it stays this way. Ordered from grub hub twice and even take-out has improved!",

    "text": "Thank God I live in California!  Home of REAL Mexican food!.   I read all the mixed reviews about this place before we went there--so we knew it was risky--even though Los Olivos was recommended by our hotel Concierge and hotel shuttle driver... I should tell you that I am a professional chef--although that may mean that my standards and expectations are high--they are, BUT I look for the basics just like everyone else:  ingredients,taste, presentation, service, ambience, etc.  Ambience=FAIL it was dirty.  Computer ethernet and other cabling crawling all over the place and detracting from the what should have been overall charm of the place. Too much unnecessary clutter. The place is old and funky , but you can maximize on that and (with a little thought and planning) use it to an advantage, and make the place a landmark--they dropped the ball on that one.= FAIL  What's with the chips??? instead of small dipping bowls with BOTH a (fresh) green and red salsa we were given thin stale chips (cold) and small carafes of (canned) pico de gallo to be poured on top of the chips? = FAIL.  When I try a \"new\"  Mexican restaurant for the first time I usually order a \"barometer\" plate that should be indicative of the way the rest of the menu dishes are prepared.  In this case:  Chile Verde. I ordered a chile verde burrito that came with a small side salad, and rice, and beans (arroz y frijoles).  Our server cautioned us that the plates were super hot--this is good, and thye were probably put under a broiler or salamander for a few minutes prior to takeout.  BUT we were dissapointed:  The medium-size diced pieces of pork were dark gray in color, dry and chewy=FAIL  they should be bigger in size and chunkier, moist and juicy with lots of salsa verde.  The flour tortilla was dry, tough=FAIL  Cheese: Cheddar NOT Monterey Jack (this is a big no-no) cold and thick not hot and oozy=FAIL   Rice:  cold, crunchy, and dry = FAIL  should be hot, fluffy, and moist.  Beans:   warm with no texture=FAIL they should look like beans or refried beans hot, and have good taste and texture.  The small side salad on the same plate had no dressing whatsoever (hey c'mon add/spoon a tablespoon of bottled Italian dressing -anything, jeezus!) and only one black olive for garnish=FAIL.   The Victoria beer I ordered (the \"waitress\" was not sure they carried it) was not ice cold. I sampled all the items on the plate, but ultimately passed on the Chile Verde=FAIL By the time our shuttle driver dropped us off at the hotel I wasn't feeling that well, and I think I know why. **Next time you are near Salinas, CA where I live, go to Rosita's (/row/zee/tahz/).  Then you will know what I am talking about.  Buen Provecho!  Glenn",

This place is offensive and their food is offensive. I was born and raised in Los Angeles and I grew up eating Mexican food. I should have went to Taco Bell :(  First, when I entered the restaurant no one greeted me. When I finally approach a little girl behind the counter....a guy from another counter behind ask \"Can I help you?\" As if I wasn't suppose to be there. I responded \"I'm looking for food????\" Right off the bat I should have ran out there but I decided to stay.  I was seated and was served a plate of chips. I asked the waitress for bean dip. 10 minutes later she comes out the most disgusting bean dip I have ever tasted served on the hottest plate...so hot it can give you 3rd degree burns!!!!.....again should have ran out the door.   I then ordered the Shrimp Enchiladas...again most disgusting shrimp enchiladas I ever tasted. How do you call yourself a \"Mexican restaurant\" and mess up enchiladas???? How???? How does that happen?????? It was drenched in melted cheese and grease....absolutely disgusting!!!!!  I couldn't finish the food. I ask for the bill and left without tipping.  This place is passing itself off as \"authentic Mexican restaurant\" to people who don't know any better. For people from Mexico or grew up around Mexican culture this place is fraud!!!!",

The food is really bad the service is bad the employees are walking around with shorts, and earrings on and tattoos I don't have anything against that it's just that I don't feel like they should work like that, the only reason they got a 1 star is because their lemonade was good, never going back again",

They are cooked in butter rather than fried which is a bonus in my book...but that means any sauces must have extra depth and oomph to bring out the flavor of the fish. I will definitely return here and hopefully make a better choice next time.",

But, I just can't get over the fact that I had an enchilada that really was just weird soupy stuff. The service was pretty dissappointing, too. As vegans eating out, we don't expect everyone to bend over backwards for our diet, but asking to get some tacos and burritos without meat and literally just being told \"nope\" is a little ridiculous. From the outside, it looked like an awesome, authentic restaurant, but the service and my meal really brought that down. It's a gorgeous building, though, so check it out if you love bad service and enchilada soup.",

Ever since my introduction to Phoenix, Los Olivos is one of the better spots for me to satisfy my Mexican cravings.  Everything I've had here is great, particularly the cheese crisps and shredded beef tacos.  Everything else is relatively standard, although I was let down by their chile rellano before, it ended up being far to greasy and soggy.  The other thing to note is that there's not really any good reason to come for dinner, unless it's unavoidable.  Their lunch and dinner specials are nearly identical, yet lunch is about $3-5 cheaper per combination plate....   Come for lunch, eat some chips and salsa, and enjoy!",

We have now gone twice recently and had a poor experience both times. We had our son's birthday dinner here and out of 8 entrees ordered everyone was in agreement that the food was below average. The best part of our dinner was the cheese crisp. Unfortunately, we probably won't be going back.",

I was excited about how easy it was to get there and that there was a free parking garage right behind the restaurant. The service was very fast and my favorite is the food always comes to you hot. (temperature) I had the combo plate, one beef taco, enchilada, rice and beans. So good and favorable. The chips came out warm so you know that they're fresh. The topper was I had a 25 dollar groupon and could bring a friend to share the experience. Thanks Los Olivos. You never let me down.",

We were seated in a room that was close to the bar, and it was SOOOO noisy.  I could barely hear the server, and the rest of my party (who are older) had a really hard time hearing her.  The food was OK.  I had the chimichanga with shredded beef.  It lacked flavor.  The salsa was good, but it came in jars you pour onto a plate.  It was much more wasteful and messy than providing a bowl of salsa.  The cheese crisp was divine.  All in all, it's far from where I was staying, and the food was only alright.  I'll keep going to the places that are closer and better.",

The restaurant is in rough shape and desperately needs new tables, chairs, paint and decoration--but we chalked up the gritty appearance to its authentic reputation. A nameless, speechless busboy dropped some chips and salsa at our table and walked away without speaking. After 15 minutes and about the time we finished the chips and salsa, a server stopped by and grunted did we want any drinks?  We'd been waiting so long, we were ready to skip straight to entrees and we ordered drinks and dinner. One of our water glasses had lipstick on it to which our server chuckled and got us a replacement. The plastic basked the chips had been in had crusted dried salsa in the bottom that we only noticed after we had finished. Our dinners arrived and the carne asada and enchilada my husband ordered was satisfactory, but my daughter's chicken burrito and my chicken chimichanga was flavorless. There was nothing inside, but bland chicken. We waited for so long to get our check that we finally went inside to pay. It was very disappointing as one of our 4 meals on our trip.",

I like the ambiance and it is a convenient location.  That being said...the food was severely lacking.  The chips and salsa were decent but they only give you one free basket.  Everything we ordered was over priced and small servings.  I am used to going out for Mexican food and taking home leftovers but this night we didn't have any food left and we paid more than we usually do.  Not to mention the food is really lacking in flavor. My husband got the famous pollo asada con queso and he said it was one of the driest things he's ever eaten.  The inside was just chicken, very little sauce on top...he actually thought perhaps it had been prepared wrong.   I got the mini sampler which had better flavors but when they say mini they mean it,  it literally was a tamale cut into a third?!  About a quarter of an enchilada?!  So weird.  Each sample was literally 2 bites.  But with a full meal price.  Beans and rice didn't have tons of flavor. Kids meals are much smaller than usual and are a hefty $7.  This place is geared towards tourists.  Unfortunately we know of many other Mexican joints in the valley that serve better food for way better prices and won't be back here.",

    "text": "I had very very low expectations for this place. Normally I wouldn't visit a place with an average of 3 stars on Yelp, except for a local friend suggested it.  Apparently, Los Olivos is an institution in Scottsdale. It's in an old building that was built at the turn of the 20th Century and the Corral family took it over in I think, 1948. They haven't done too much to update the decor since. In a good way. It's charming in its connection to old wild west Arizona. There were old gelatin prints of family members who've now likely passed. Kitschy southwestern paintings. Wood carvings, Native American style. The ambiance is loud, casual and low-key.  On Valentines Day, we were grateful to have a reservation because the entire restaurant (of at least 100 tables) was packed. However, they provided us with quick service and our food came promptly.   We started with chips and salsa, which I think were free. The regular salsa was tasty and the chips were warm. A lot of water was separating from the salsa (see my pic below) but it didn't affect the flavor.  I ordered Machaca which was pulled apart beef seasoned in pepper and other spices. It was okay but I was in LOVE with the beans, rice and what seemed to be homemade tortillas. The tortillas were paper thin and wonderful.   Others ordered the chicken fajitas, which were apparently very good. I stole a piece of chicken to taste. It was slightly overdone, but the flavor was there. And the sizzle of its arrival had me salivating. :)  They allowed us to stay and linger and it was a very relaxing experience. I'd go again and get the vegetarian fajitas with extra beans and rice. :)  It's just a fun kitschy place that serves decent food. This isn't fine dining and you're not going to write home about it, but it fills your belly without breaking the bank.",

    "text": "This is my \"go to\" Mexican restaurant in the valley. I have been eating here for 25 years and in fact, I ate here my very first night in Arizona.   Chips and salsa are always out of this world good. Made fresh daily, they serve two types. Hot and hotter! The hot is a traditional chunky tomato salsa with onions, jalapenos, cilantro, etc. The hotter salsa is smooth red chili. Both delicious and really good mixed together.   I highly recommend getting a side of guacamole to enjoy with your chips and salsa. Hands down, best homemade guacamole you will ever eat. I don't know how they do it, but I have not had better anywhere.   Their food is great. I don't have a set favorite thing so I have tried just about everything on the menu. Today I had the carne asada and enchilada. Steak was very tender and flavorful. Outstanding! Another favorite of mine is the steak fajitas.   Combinations are also a hit and they have several to choose from.  They also have lunch specials Monday-Friday.   Fried ice cream? Don't miss it. Traditionally served, coated in cinnamon crunch and honey. Mmm!  My favorite server at Los Olivos is Toni. She is very sweet and is a fantastic server. I always ask for her when I go in. Not to worry though, all the other servers are great too.   Next time you need a Mexican food fix, try Los Olivos in Old Town Scottsdale and be sure to ask for Toni!  Enjoy!",

The tortillas are greasy and so thin and tasteless that I was amazed to see my fingers through them.  How can you ruin a tortilla?? My taco crumbled into an oily mess after one bite.   The beans taste old and starchy. The chicken is boiled to death in water without seasoning.  The cheese enchiladas were cold inside.  And the rice was overlooked. And bland.  However the salsa was tasty but for some reason served in small wine carafes.  We were told to \" pour the salsa on the chips as we ate them\". A new idea I guess.  The server was sweet and friendly yet oblivious to the atrocious quality of the food.  The owner was busy flirting with the help and although willing to exchange our plates for something else we were just anxious to leave as quickly as possible and locate some Tums.   Additionally parking next to the restaurant was a mistake because the horrific smell of old and putrid grease nearly destroyed our nasal passages.  It is a shamble of a place - both the structure and the food.  Be aware.    Just around the corner is a better choice-  the Mission Restaurant!!!  This is a quality establishment-",

Over the years, consistently great food and service. Sour cream enchiladas outstanding. Cheese crisp also outstanding. Server Ana last week was excellent. I might move back to the Valley in a couple of years. If I do, Los Olivos will see me about once a week. (From our visit of 4 April 2018: there were 6 of us, so 15% gratuity was on our bill. I missed that and put a 20% gratuity on my credit card charge slip. But the charge just cleared my bank, and Los Olivos took off the 20% I had given. How's that for honesty.)",

Having just gotten back from vacation, we were making the decision to eat clean so we ordered chicken breast (3 off us). The waitress said \"just chicken breast? Ok\". We added a side of black beans and received refried     Eating our dinner- our friend stops eating and says her dinner was terrible and chose not to eat it...  the bill comes and is $100.16.     Thinking surely there is a mistake, I look and the waitress charged 19.90 for our two chicken breasts!    So 60.00 for 6 thin and dry chicken breasts   I go to the manager and kindly ask if he could look at ur bill and that there must be a mistake. He felt possibly the same saying he would take care of it.   Total bill is now 78.00  Comes back to our table and says \"well you did order two breasts each. I took one off though\" we said \" your joking right?\"  He said \" no, and walked away. The waitress came over and we expressed disappointment- she said \" I don't determine the prices\" and also walked away.    Entertainment and older Hispanic busboy were excellent.  This place is dirty and grimey. Will never return.  So disappointed in the service, attention to doing the right thing and overall ROBBERY    This is my first yelp review so you can imagine how pissed I must feel.  #feelingviolated So tempted to dine and dash.

It's disappointing that when they have deals like \"taco Tuesday\" it's only if you sit at the bar...most people don't want that so pointless and unfair. We get the tacos always and they're greasy goodness! Service is pretty generic. Nothing to rave about. We went here one Saturday night and they had a young man in a hoodie and torn jeans as the \"host\". You could tell he hated being there and was just filing in and pretty much doing nothing.

Mild salsa was watery and not much flavor.  Chips were good and thin.  Started out with the house margarita.  It was awful.  So,  I got the Cadillac margarita which was much better.  I got the shredded beef burro enchilada style.  It was edible but lacked flavor.  My friend got the chicken enchilada and the green corn tamale.  She said the enchilada was bland and the tamale was extremely sweet.  Won't be returning here on my own free will.",

Her Med Rare was charred done.  My fajitas were a salty, oily pile of onions & peppers.   To top it off we gave our Groupon to our waitress & the fun really began....Claudia wrote the voucher # down & tried to redeem it but there was bad reception and it would not show as \"Used\".  We offered to go outside & try to connect... No luck... Groupon server was down. We went back in and Claudia told us we would have to call Groupon and she couldn't honor the voucher.  We asked to speak to a manager and she was very pleasant and explained that it happened to them three times this evening and as long as the waitress already had the voucher # it would be no problem. The picture is of our unbussed table after we paid our check and went through this 15 minutes of hassle!  Claudia needs additional CUSTOMER SERVICE training!",

    "text": "This is a tough one. I want to like this place but....   It is definitely local and been around for forever. You almost wouldn't know it is there. It is kind of tucked back in a corner off a side street but easy enough to find. I like the inside decor. Different rooms almost with different themes. One almost looks like you are kind of underwater. I was meeting other friends here who were already inside so I wandered in. I told the hostess I was meeting people and was told that I could go and find them. Sure it would have been nice to have been lead to the table but most of the time they just seem to be walking with you anyway so that could be points off or not. Easily found my friends and sat down. Water and menus were already on the table and we were still waiting for a few more. Looking over the drinks I see they have Modelo Especial on tap it would be better if it was Negro Modelo but that will do. Waitress came over after a few minutes and took my drink order. It came out pretty quick and in the mean time I was looking over the menu and the rest of the party showed up. When asked the waitress said she couldn't do separate checks but could split them up at the end. That was ok. I finally decided on the Machaca after asking my friends who had been here before what they recommended. I had never had it before. While we were waiting it was chips and salsa time. They were ok. Nothing really great. Salsa wasn't really that hot. I know it was way under powered for my friends who like very spicy salsa though. The food came out after not too long. It came in waves. I will say that my water was never empty and dirty plates were not around very long. Here is where it gets tough because after everything being so so the food was really good. Nice flavor on the beef and homemade tortillas were very good. Overall it was a very good meal. Not disappointed at all. Now this isn't my new favorite place and it wasn't some of the best Mexican food I have had in the Valley but it was good. Good enough that I would like to go back and try it again with a smaller group and see how the experience is then. They could even earn another star.  One tip: From second hand information, having not experienced it myself, I'm told go to the bathroom here at your own risk. It is pretty bad. That is just what I have heard.",

The place was just picking up since the ball game was not to far off and it was Dinner time as well. Service was very efficient and pleasant. I'm partial to Chicken what ever in these Mexican style resturaunts, and had a 'Chimi'. Arrived shortly and enjoyed it emencely. I would recomend Los Olivos to anyone. Looks as if they can handle most any size group as well! Everything is reasonably priced as well. Enjoy! Holla!",

Always greeted with a smile when we walk in, and when we bring our toddler, they try to seat us next to the fish tank for her enjoyment. I could drink their \"mild\" salsa from a glass and the \"hot\" has a perfect chili taste to it. My hubs will order the #1 combo without fail (taco, tamale, enchilada) and I go between the mini sampler, the guacamole dinner salad (not on the menu anymore, but ask for it!) or the Pollo a la Queso Crema. The Cadlillac margarita is great, too. A little on the pricey side for a casual dinner spot, but we've never been disappointed.",

He got the steak and shrimp fajitas and a corona. I got the fajita taco salad and a margarita. My margarita was watered down beyond belief and my bf's beer was nearly warm by the time we got it. The atmosphere is unique and reminds me of old mexico city, but with that comes dirty floors, flies, and gnats. Although the presentation of our food was beautiful, the quality of the food itself was a bit sketchy. The shrimp in the fajitas were over cooked and rubbery. The steak was also way over cooked and tough, and my chicken was very dry which is surprising since it was fajitas. Nonetheless, we endured our drinks through slow service and mediocre food just to later get sick that night and the following day. Which resulted in a ER visit and a day of lost work. Lets just say I will never return. And there are more authentic mexican places in the valley that wont get you sick. No wonder this place is running groupons ALL the time.",

    "text": "The food at this place really only deserves two stars, but it's a decent enough restaurant to grab Mexican food with a large group while out in Scottsdale, so three stars it is...   I used to come to this place every now and then with friends while living in Scottsdale, and we all agreed that it was mostly for convenience & the fact that the people who own the place are very nice. In other words we didn't come for great Mexican food,..   I came here recently with four other people (one of which was a child) while visiting Scottsdale. I ordered a combination plate with a green corn tamale, chile relleno, beans, and rice. The beans & rice were kind of bland, but not bad. The chile relleno & tamale were both covered in the same green sauce, which was also kind of bland. None of the food was bad, just bland. Actually, the chile relleno was pretty good (it was cheesy).   The group I was with ordered queso dip w/spinach as an appetizer, which was actually pretty good! I have to say the chips & salsa here are pretty damn tasty as well!   The service is friendly, but kind of slow and not very attentive (everyone who works here is nice though, so I guess they make up for there shortcoming by serving with kindness). It took us awhile to get drink refills, but the food came pretty quickly. One thing that I think is really nice here is that they will allow you to pay at the front counter if you need to divide up a bill. As far as pricing goes I actually think it's a little on the higher side for the quality and what you actually get, but it's not horrible. My meal was $13 or $14 and I did have leftovers. In terms of atmosphere, it's cheesy Mexican decor (that's not a good thing or a bad thing...it's just what it is).   When I'm back in Scottsdale and want Mexican food I'm sure this place will get suggested. I won't be the one suggesting it, but I wouldn't be opposed to it if someone else did.",
