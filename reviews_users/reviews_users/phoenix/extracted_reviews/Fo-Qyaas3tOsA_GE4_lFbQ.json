The owner was extremely rude, disrespectful and couldn't care less that we were upset. I have never posted a yelp review but I am so furious in how we were treated and how terrible the service was.

Apparently Gus's doesn't like it when you use a coupon.  From the attitude when I ordered, to the \"hidden\" 18% gratuity (that they told me about after I questioned my total and also tipped on the credit card (beware of the 50 cent fee to use a credit card), this place should focus only on their late night drunk crowd from the bars.  The only good thing about the whole experience was they \"accidently\"  packaged my order \"to-go\".  Yeah sure, I bet having two hungry toddlers in the store for 40 minutes while we waited for our order made them re-think offering a \"dine-in only\" coupon.",

They no longer honor the $10/$25 ones...only the higher value ones, yet they are still being sold. Between that and that the place was completely empty at noon should have been an indication, but we decided to try it anyway.  The cashier got or order wrong several times.  We finally got our pizza and wings after waiting a reasonable time. Our soda was suppose to be a 32 oz fountain drink came as 16 oz.  We asked for diet coke, she brought bought of us coke (after we told her diet coke each of the three times she asked.) Finally getting the diet coke, it tasted super bitter so we ended up getting cans instead. Two bucks for a can of soda, bring your own!  The pizza was under cooked even with a nice thin crust.  The kids will like it reheated though.  Our boneless wings that we ordered not only ended up with bones, but was overcooked to the point you counted get it off the bone.  Lastly, you have to pay 50 cents on top of the bill if you want to pay by credit card - which depending on the processor is illegal to do.  End result, save your money, keep your appetite.  Go to Joe's Pizza two doors down.  You'll be happy you did.",

The toasted Italian grinder was at least in the ballpark.  The provalone was melted, the italian salami was good, and the bread was first rate.  My only real complaint was that the assembly was all orchestrated in the back room so I couldn't direct the amount of lettuce, pickle or onion, and there was no hot pepper.  Also the two employees showed absolutely no interest in winning over the customer.",

The sauce was perfect and had plenty of oregano, it had the right amount of cheese and it was cooked to order (a bit crispy, please).....I especially loved the crust, partly crispy and the edges were delicious and a bit chewy, JUST the way I like!!!

    "text": "I ordered my pizza online at around 1:45am.  Apparently there was an issue with the order not going through although I did get a confirmation screen from their website.  So when I didn't get a call I called them. I understand that it's their weeds hour when the bars get out, so I'm not being overly harsh, but... It is now 3:37.  I've been up just waiting for my pizza so as not to be a jerk, but I've called twice, each time being told they were \"just leaving\". Keep in mind, I must just be stupid for ordering from them because another time I ordered they literally DID NOT SHOW UP, late or otherwise.  They just didn't come.  Another time the pizza came smashed.  Keep in mind I have ordered from them probably only a half-dozen times. And as I'm writing this, the delivery guy called me and said he knocked and no one came to the door, and asked if I still wanted the pizza.  I was sitting on my patio, because I'm not going to sit by the door for two hours waiting for a pizza that has historically been proven to maybe never arrive.  Before calling me he left.  After I waited two hours for a pizza. The delivery driver read me my total and asked for my money even though I paid on the phone with my card, AND online with my card.  And now I'm eating the pizza, which is cold and sloppily made, which I could excuse if it arrived anywhere near on time.  They also didn't bring the sides I ordered. Why they did not comp my meal is beyond me.  I work in the service industry and I'm the most understanding person in the world but this was inexcusable.  Oh, and for all of this, I was very nice when the driver arrived, and still tipped.  Here's his apology: \"Sorry for the lateness.  It's always like this.\"   Next time I want to order from Gus' I'll just give someone 25 dollars to punch me in the face instead.  There is absolutely no way this experience could have realistically gotten any worse barring my just opening the box to find in place of my pizza a note that said \"Joke's on you, go screw yourself\".  I would have one to sleep two hours ago if not for this god-awful experience.  I am literally amazed.",

But really, let's be honest with ourselves, Gus's is not really that great, it fills a niche and that is an afterhours grub spot to fill the tummies of the drunks and help sober them up to get home. Alcohol and dancing does make you hungry, and Gus's does that.   Choices are limited for afterhours grub in old town, there's the Philly Sandwich co., two pizza joints, and denny's up the street. limited offerings, and the closest best mexican drive thru in my opinion is 2 miles away - FAIL. So you'[re stuck with Gus's where the douches come out and have fights while in line, people constantly cut, and there's a lack of order and at times civility but that depends on the night or weekend. I've only had the pepperoni and cheese pies. good? yes when you're buzzed/drunk anything's good and yummy. When sober, not so much. A-OK well it's satisfying and I've always scored free pies due to mass confusion. lol. good times.",

    "text": "I first wrote this review immediately following my experience at Gus's. I was disgusted and pretty pissed off at that point, so I decided to come back and write my review once I had calmed down and didn't want to scream at the employees for their complete lack of interest and care. First off, I have one compliment- the door guy was absolutely wonderful! He did his job well, and he was pleasant while he did it. Now on to the two disrespectful young men behind the counter... After ordering 2 slices of pizza from the extremely lacking display case (God forbid you ask what pizza is coming out next because they will consider you to be hostile), I asked for my pizza to be well done (you would have thought I was asking Santa for a new pony by the kid's reaction)... the gentleman, who actually wasn't on his phone the entire time, CHUCKLED at my request and then responded \"No\". I should have walked away there and went across the street or next door. THEN, I waited at the register while the incompetent cashier played on his PHONE for almost 3 minutes while I waited. HE WAS ON HIS PHONE! He did not look up once until the other guy prompted him to. Once the food came out, and I was pretty frustrated already, my slices were soggy and flavorless, so I made once last request at the counter to the man saying NO again to putting my slices into the oven to be cooked to well done (I'm sorry but I don't want to have to eat my pizza with a spoon). Although I realize this was not proper etiquette, I nonetheless called to the KIND man in the kitchen to please cook my pizza longer, and he happily obliged. I NEVER write bad reviews for restaurants because I believe there are unknown reasons that people have a bad night or a restaurant is maybe struggling in certain areas to find their way, BUT this is NOT that place. This is a restaurant that hires 2 careless employees who have no understanding of customer service or any sort of kindness towards patrons- and I have seen this during my experience, as well as read about it in several reviews of this location. Hopefully the owner/management can turn this place around so that the good employees have a place to work, but I would not be surprised if this is just turned into something more productive and delicious! Try it yourself if you choose, but good luck, my friends. You're in for a treat.",

    "text": "My friends and I came here to get some pizza while bar hopping today and it was literally the biggest mistake of this weekend. This older woman who worked the cash register was so rude, literally becoming combative with multiple customers, holding orders hostage in an attempt to correct people's demeanor, and called the cops on people for acting a little rowdy. I was just trying to get pizza and the lady took my credit card, gave it back to me, and accused me of trying to get free pizza after I asked for the pizza afterwards. I then checked my bank account to see if I was charged, saw that it wasn't, told her that she never charged my card and asked why she even gave my card back to me, and then she got super rude with me and told me \"I don't give free pizza here, I'm not stupid, I know I didn't charge your card.\" I can't believe this place is still even open. She literally looked like an ex drug user and seemed to be taking her unfortunate life out on people just trying to get pizza for $3.25 a slice. Go to Joe's instead of this place. The people that work there actually have all their teeth and were very pleased to take money in exchange for pizza without any drama. The cops who came to investigate at Gus's told me the same thing, \"I wouldn't even come here, I would just go to Joe's.\"",

    "text": "You know, I honestly wasn't expecting too much from Gus's NY Pizza Lounge when I stumbled in the other night at who knows what hour of the morning. As it turns out, my already low expectations were just barely met.   Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?  So you've just emerged from the Old Town Scottsdale club scene having no doubt made various mistakes of any and every kind, and more than anything in the world, you require sustenance. Well, you're not only in good company, but Gus's is one of the few places thats both walkable and open, so you trot on in, hopefully with a recently found temporary companion in tow that won't have you questioning your choices in life come morning. As far as service? It's pretty straight forward. You walk in, you wait in line, and you're given some lamp-warmed pizza from someone who probably won't judge you to the extent that the normal human being should. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Yikes. I was in no state of mind to take a photo, but $4.00 got me a what was a pretty standard sized piece of pizza (meat lovers in this case). You can see pics from other users on here, but needless to say, that's not even close to being worth it. $4.00? That's a king's fortune at any drive-thru window even at this hour. If we were looking at top of the line authentic New York pie? Sure, but we're not. No Star Granted.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Blech. I'm inclined to withhold both stars here on account that this was some warmed-up, greasy dissapointment if nothing else, but two things will keep a star in tact. First and foremost, it was better than what I'd experienced the night before at Slices in Tempe (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/slices-pizza-tempe\">yelp.com/biz/slices-pizz...</a>). Second? I was actually really impressed that they had a gyro pizza, which didn't entirely insult the cuisine. However, don't be mistaken. This was greasy, soft, and not all that great. Single Star Granted.  Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  I've had better. Way better, and that's the definition of two stars. I probably won't be back. No Star Granted.",

I asked for the food to be remade and sent out but upon arrival the meatball sub was cold and literally had three meatballs cut in half and placed on an extra large roll that was burnt and hard.  The next mornings we drove the .7 miles to Gus's and the day manager stated that we had to speak with the night manager. I left my business card but never heard from anyone.

Cleanliness: the smell of a rat nest emanates from behind the counter. Every chair is sticky. No star.  Food: ordered a calzone and some wings. The dough was pretty good. Small calzone has half of a medium pizza in size. One star.  Service: the cashier/server/whatever seemed to hate his job. I wouldn't blame him since the manager/cook/whatever was rudely critiquing him while I was ordering. The server was surprised we ate in for lunch; probably because we were the only people there. No star.  Price: $10 for a salad. $5 for a slice of pizza. Calzone was $7. It's really not priced well for the value. No star.  Overall: do not recommend. This may be the last review I ever write, because I might die from this food.",

I ordered from here a few weeks ago and my order took over 2 hrs, when eat 24 called them, I received a phone call from the driver wanting to charge me extra to deliver the pizza I had been waiting for.

The delivered within about an hour (which is fine, my place can be hard to find) and I enjoyed the meal.  Would I order from them again? Absolutely. Are they the best pizza in the world? No, but for 20 bucks for all that food, it suited me just fine. :)",

This was in response to am over 2 hour wait time with not call from the restaurant. I called in and I have to assume they just forgot my pizza, it was a pepperoni pizza. Not the hardest pie in the world and I live maybe 2 miles away. He claimed it was New Years and that is why. Well then don't offer delivery. I'm sorry but when I see an ad up for pizza delivery, I would believe you would have taken the necessary steps to sufficiently staff your business. I mean, were you surprised it was busy? All in all, the pizza is normally okay minus the uncooked flour on the crusted and the consistently charred bottom. It's good for when you're drunk and have no choice or can simply just forget you ordered so their terrible service time goes unnoticed. Also, a couple off this ago a guy in a taxi can delivered my pizza. I'm not even sure he has his food handlers permit. I'd be surprised if this business meets standard requirements when it comes to proper food handling. Well I'll sit here and wait for a BS email from their manager talking about how that's not how we do business etc. hahaha",

Only because of that I am not calling this place again and instead I went to another pizza place by Scottsdale road which is an Italian family owned restaurant , it was amazing! ..Its called Lo cascio... I called this place last night and after one hour waiting for my pizza I called and they said that they tried to call me (lie) and that it went directly to voicemail (lame) and they didn't leave a message?? Because they had the wrong address (lie again) ... So I said you know what you better not bring me that cold pizza, you need to make a new one, that girls was so rude and she said I will hook you up?? After another 30 min The driver called back, saying if I could please give them AGAIN my credit card number (to the driver???) because they had the wrong number.! I said are you still at the shop? He said yes... It was already two hours late! I said to the driver please let me talk to the girl, I asked her what's happening? She said don't worry I am sending you an extra 2 liter soda!! Haha please! I then decided I didn't want that pizza anymore! And she only responded ok bye. Do not waste your money here when you can get a better quality in pizza and customer service down the street... I am never calling back to this place... Ever!",

Papa Johns won't help you, Dominoes won't help you, Nobody will help you. Your girlfriend is puking beer vomits out in the bathroom because it's now Sunday morning, and that is the type of couple you are. Hearing the viscous but chunky puke come up has almost made you give up the search for a late night meal that will deliver. Then Kevin opens his dirty mouth: \"Dude...Gus's....\" A silence falls over the room as your comrades look at you for the Ceasarian thumbs up or down. You have had about 17 beers, so you give it the thumbs up, but there is no applause, for everyone knows what horrors await. You call Gus's New York Pizza Lounge. Through the void, you can vaguely hear the order taker on the phone as drunk douche bags from Old Town try to kill each other off over the madness of douchebaggery and shitty pizza. You look back at Kevin, hoping someone will take the phone from you; hoping someone will put an end to this awful decision, but no. He gives you a nod. You cringe as you order a Pepperoni pizza, for if you try to order anything out of the ordinary, you know the order will come out wrong anyway. Over the phone, you swear that the total was 17.99, but this will all be forgotten in the eon's it will actually take for Hitler's pizza to arrive at your domicile. You have completed the order, and you dare not use your debit card as the possibility of the pizza never arriving looms over your head. Now you and your friends patiently wait for doom. An hour into the wait, and one of your friends decides he is now sober enough to just drive home. 15 minutes pass. Your girlfriend is passed out in the bed. Kevin is waiting with you like a trooper. God bless Kevin. Another 20 minutes. Just as you are about to think you are sober enough to just drive to McDonald's for those Hot N' Spicy Chicken Sandwiches, the phone rings. The delivery guy is outside. You go down to get the pizza which is somehow now 39 dollars. You're already upset about waiting this long for food, and the fight has been this long anyway, so you pay. The driver doesn't even say anything. He just shoves the shit pizza in your face, punches you in the dick, and gives you HIV. You return to Kevin, with a weak victory. Both of you open the box to find naught but a piece of dough baked into a trucker's turds. But you know what? You eat it through a grimace and Kevin dies of dysentery. Your girlfriend breaks up with you on account of the HIV, and the owner comes over and kicks you in the dick just one more time.",

I placed an oder from this restaurant via the app and an hour later received a call from a woman who works there. I don't know her relationship to the business, but she demanded I pay an extra $5 for delivery via calling Eat24 (which I ordered through) and having them edit the tip amount I had paid. Her reasoning for this was that I had been charged an inaccurate delivery fee.  Upon explaining to her that it had been an hour since I had placed this order and was confused why I was only now receiving a call about this as well as the fact that it is their responsibility to make sure they are charging accurate delivery fees, she began yelling at a gentleman in the background. She reiterated what she had said and I pushed back again. She informed me she didn't know wha was going on, and that I would need to speak to \"him.\" A this point I would like to say that it was not the money I was concerned about it was the customer service I was receiving.  The woman I had been speaking to put down the phone and then I could distinctly hear her arguing with a gentleman in the background. He did not want to take the phone call, she did not know how to handle the situation, and so on. I then heard him tell her to get out and go home.  The gentleman then picked up the phone and we had a similar conversation to the one I had had with his female counterpart, only he continuously talked aver me and what rude. The call ended with him saying he didn't care, he would be getting paid either way and I told him to go ahead and not deliver my order, I would go and cancel with Eat24.  It is rare that I write a review. I either have to be extremely impressed or, as in this case, extremely dissatisfied with my experience.",

I told her you took my $ I want my pizza, that has been now sitting in the top area for a while . She ignore me and went to the next customer.   Finally talk to another worker there and he got my cold pizza and ask if i got my soda? The girl rude as can be said oh you had a soda. Told the girl beside me at least your normal.   #1 I was not drunk or on drugs, but I think the workers there need to get tested for being on drugs. They seem to be at a loss by holding peoples credit cards and not realizing they are holding after they charge card within a min the girl reasking for him to pay. Happen to customer next to me. Crazy she needs to be FIRED!",

I was assured that I would not be charged and to have a great night.   Fast forward to when I received my credit card statement and was surprised to see a charge for pizza I never received. I called Gus and calmly explained that there had been an error and my card was incorrectly charged. I provided my cell phone number and the date of the charge.   When she asked for the CC number I explained that my card had been stolen since this charge and I don't have access to that number anymore. She then accused me of lying and asked if I even remembered ordering the pizza. I asked if there was any other way that this could be looked up as it seemed a bit weird that the ONLY information they would choose to keep on file would be my CC number. She then went on about how it seemed a bit fishy to her that I wouldn't have it and that it sounded like I had a lot of money if I was willing to front my credit card being stolen. WHAT DOES THAT EVENT MEAN?!   Let's be real. This pizza I never got was only 31.75. However, the way this employee spoke to me was incredibly disrespectful and inappropriate. I told her she could take up her concerns with Discover and opened a case where Gus will now have to prove delivery. I've never had this pizza and after this experience you can guarantee I never will.",

Went for pizza to beat the crowds before the bar closed  and ended up waiting a collective total of 45 minutes for two slices of CHEESE pizza anyway! After I ordered, they didn't have any cheese slices left so I had to wait which is fine I get that.  I go back to the counter 15 minutes later wondering what's going on when I see several guys one after another coming in and slipping this bigger guy (who was actually really nice) cash to just skip the line and get them pizzas. He even snagged a couple waters for them too from the fridge he was standing by. I noticed at least six people doing this while I was standing on the side waiting while everyone else was just waiting in line the FAIR WAY.  These guys were walking out with ENTIRE pizzas after two minutes after I and many others had been waiting for about a half hour at this point just because they were sliding money to this guy as tips under the table. I will not come back to this establishment I don't care if the \"pizza is better than Joe's\" which I highly doubt- because once I finally got my pizza it was COMPLETELY BURNED. At that point I was just so annoyed, ate about half and went to Taco Bell. THANK YOU Taco Bell for saving me from an unfair corrupt establishment. If it wasn't evident already; don't go here especially on a Friday or Saturday night after the bars unless you have an in with the big dude at the wait area to get ahead of everyone else.",

I called BS, said we were told twice already that they were \"on the way.\"  Guy on the phone was flustered, didn't know what to do or say other than offer to re-enter the order.

We also ordered garlic knots that arrived much too undercooked to even eat, and marinara sauce was missing.    I should have checked before the delivery driver left.  Anyway, I contacted them to request the correct pizza be delivered or for a refund.  I was told I wouldn't receive a refund unless the entire wrong pizza was returned first.  Too bad two pieces had already been eaten!  Thankfully, Eat24 stepped in and had the correct pizza delivered, but by that time we had lost our appetite and the terrible service left a bad taste in our mouths.

And my slice was served at an acceptable temperature! The toppings were not high quality by any means, but they seemed fresh and tasted fine! I came fairly close to closing time, so the pies were being taken out of the serving area, but the guy sold me a slice of supreme for $3.00, so that was appreciated! I prefer this place over Joe's but I shall probably do what I did on this night on my next visit, and that's have a slice from each place! Late night food is almost impossible to find in Old Town Scottsdale on weekdays so these places though not great are suitable for that late night pizza craving!",

When my friend took one more bite of her tacos, he violently grabbed the box of tacos out of her hands, spilling tacos on all of us.

    "text": "I am absolutely shocked at the poor management of this establishment. I called to report a sexual harassment incident by one of their delivery drivers. After the daytime manager (phone call was January 20 at 2:38pm) answered, I was able to only tell him the time of my order (around 4am that morning) before he extremely rudely interjected by saying, \"I'm not the night manager and I'm not going to relay anything to him\". I attempted to tell him that my complaint was of sexual harassment by a delivery driver which he responded to by telling me that I'm a \"smart-a**\" and proceeded to tell the staff not to answer the phone again. I am absolutely repulsed by the piss poor attitude of the \"manager\".   The incident from the morning: My roommates and I, all female, ordered chicken wings at around 4am. Our building is tricky to find, so two of us went to the parking lot to grab the order. The delivery guy asked where my roommate works and if she has a boyfriend, she responded by saying that she works around the area and does have a boyfriend. He then replied by saying, and this is a direct quote, \"Damn b*tch, you're fine as h*ll, mama. I'm going to  come find you at work. Let me know when your mans slips up, baby, because I'm going to be here waiting.\" We're not sure of the delivery man's name (we didn't receive a receipt with the wings), but the order was placed on January 20 at 3am and the driver got to us around 4am. His name started with the letter K.  I am appalled at the fact that a pizza delivery driver has the audacity to say anything of that nature to anyone, let alone a 19 year old girl. Another concern of ours regarding the situation was the fact that this man had our address.   We will NOT be ordering from here anymore.",

Why would I pay for a pizza and not pick it up  I don't recommend the calzones save your  dollar$$$ go somewhere else. But the pizza is GREAT! They do rush the pizza and make it quick",

    "text": "Verdict: Sorry Scottsdale, it's not NY pizza.   The flavor was okay but otherwise underwhelming for texture of the crust. The pepperoni was average and didn't have a lot of kick for flavor.  Gus is just outside of a bar or three so it's probably great drunk food. Come to think of it, there were several drunk people there when we went. The one guy offered me a bite of his slice. It was a nice gesture but I respectfully declined.  This joint is what I would describe as a bit of a hole in the wall. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Holes in the wall are some of my favorite places because they can bring something special. Unfortunately, this was the wrong kind of special for me. I might consider going here again if it were late and I were pretty drunk and hungry.",

We were waiting in line and I jokingly asked the guy at the door \"ooh New York style pizza, what makes it New York style?\" I like to joke with people and figured he'd say something funny back. Instead he absolutely freaked out, started attacking my character and demanding I leave. I apologized to him several times and said I didn't mean to offend him, I'm not one to purposely start problems with people. He wouldn't even accept my apology and looked like he wanted to punch me in the face as I was saying sorry. Mind you I'm a 5'2 100 pound girl. The whole thing was crazy and so unnecessary. Clearly the overwhelming 1 star reviews I am definitely not alone on this dumpster fire of an establishment. And seeing how others say the pizza taste like soggy cardboard, maybe he was just insecure about my question? Whatever, I guess he saved us overpaying on a crappy pizza.",

    "text": "Gus's in Old Town is an establishment that conducts business in a very immoral, disrespectful, and potentially illegal way. The owner is apparently only on site between 3 AM and 6 AM, so I will resort to Yelp, BBB, and word of mouth.  I've ordered pizza from them twice, and both times have been double-charged on my order that took over 1.5 hours to arrive.  This last time, after my double charge, there was also a fraudulent purchase.  My credit card company is reviewing this and will hopefully take the correct legal action.   As the saying goes, shame on me.  Unfortunately I had hoped the first time was an honest mistake.  Needless to say I will never order from here again and urge all of my friends and neighbors to avoid them as well.  As far as the pizza is concerned, do yourself a favor and save $25 ($30 for a large pizza) by buying a decent oven pizza for when you come home from the bars.",

We'd just left the overcrowded and noisy (albeit lively) Majerle's, and needed some food that wouldn't require a twist and shout performance to acquire.  Gus's shone like a beacon, with its short line, greasy food under heat lamps and empty patio with TVs showing the game.    I only had a bite or two of pizza, but it tasted like your standard New York style thin crust.  There were plenty of flavors available, including Buffalo Chicken which looked quite good.  I opted for a Caesar Salad, which was twice as expensive but twice as big, full of greens, parmesan, dressing and way too many croutons.  Gus's won't become famous for their salad, but it was better than I expected.    Beware of the ($10?) credit card minimum charge.  Due to a loud evening and a thick accent, I didn't understand the warning until it was too late.    Assuming I have cash next time, I would definitely stop by again for a slice if I'm in Old Town for a while, but more for ease, price and grease than for quality ;)",

My group of 5 was fine, but the group behind us left after they heard that bizarre update. The pizza itself was nothing special.",

    "text": "If you find yourself in a certain part of Old Town, after a late night of drinking, Gus's is like a beacon in the night.  Let's be honest, what's more alluring that greasy food after a night of alcohol fueled debauchery.  We stumbled in last night, after some pre-Halloween celebrating.  There was a line, but it moved relatively quickly.  My friend ordered two slices, I opted for the cheese fries.  Ordering something other than pizza on a late night could result in a debacle, but thankfully one of the employees there was super helpful.  As I waited for my fries, he grabbed a handful of suckers and put them in my basket, so not only did I get awesome service, I now have enough dum dums to last till next year.  He was kind enough to bring my fries outside so I didn't have to wait inside. With all those heat lamps, drunken bodies, and my long velvet cape, I was seriously hot; and not just in a conceited way.  ;)  Gus's is also a great place to people watch.  If you sit outside, you get a front row seat to the drunken flow of people in between clubs & bars, and an occasional police incident.    The music is loud, the patrons are drunk, and the food is greasy.  What more could you ask for on a Saturday night?",

NO. well, this place is next to uhhh myst? whatever that place is with the flames. would love it if those flames catch this shithole on FIRE (used to be sultry dogs). never before seen this building busy or close to having more than a few customers at a time at any given time with any given name...not surprised it SUCKED.  easily the worst pizza place i have eaten in town. granted i was a bit tipsy and its near 2am.. but, i ordered what looked like a sausage/pepperoni slice and some garlic knots, at $2.99, cause the breadstix usually tells me how a place fairs on food. the bill was $8 even. turns out i got the meat lovers slice for $5.01(?). could barely tell. it took them at least 5 minutes to heat up the slice.  the knots came out a solid 15 minutes after i ordered. jeez okay. wonder how long their so-called 32\" giant pizza takes to cook. this is supposed to be a 24-hr after-hour club party refuge?? jokes.  anyway the knots did look impressive for only 3 bucks. 5 fat knots. to be honest they were cooked near perfect flaky on the outside, extra doughy on the inside. and the texture was amazing oh yeah!.. WAIT. eating them however was quite the opposite. completely and utterly tasteless. neither/nor with their garlic brush, garlic dip, or extra garlic salt. everything was so bland. the bread taste just terrible. even the marinara dipping was terrible and blannnd as well. i thought i had cancer or was having a stroke for a minute. i tried to concentrate on making it taste good, taste at all. not happening.  now back to the slice. not impressed at all. to be fair, it did have a minimal 'taste'. for 5 bucks i should be able to see and taste the other 3 toppings i didnt see in the first place though. weak as eff.  now the menu looks impressive with salad sandwiches calzones etc. the 'we serve beer & wine' graphic jumped out first thing. great advertising! \"ill have a...\" except the part where THEY DO NOT SERVE BEER OR WINE YET. ok. idiots. oh there was a girl that stopped in to order some cheese fries. i was like 'ohh good choice....' no deal. they dont have those either, or, they choose not to serve them at that time. the dude answered like it wasnt blatantly on the menu in front of us, and very unfriendly to begin with. again. idiots.  im giving this a 0.34 star just for being another ridiculous place for pizza when *pizza pie, joe's, and best of italy* are all within view, literally. literally! and those are all better even on their worst days. this only gets that much of a score since i didnt actually try all of their food. dont expect to either. dont bother!  update: are you kidding me their website doesnt even seem to exist....JERKS!  update: really, so bad i might start picketing outside there tomorrow  \"soft dough, but please go! more pizza? hell no!\"  jeff out!  ::drops mic::",

After repeated attempts to get a refund, calling the business daily, no refund was issued.  In 30 days of promises, I never got a single call back.  I finally had direct contact with the owner after 30 days. He informed me delivery driver had quit and kept the cash, but that as a business owner, he had to make his money somehow.  I pointed out that in order for him to make his $52.17, I was then paying $112.17 for my pizza. He said he can't control what the driver did, though as the business owner who hired the driver, he is responsible for the drivers theft.  No matter what, the customer should not pay twice.    The owner had NO signed receipt but still refused to refund the money to the card.  He agreed I paid cash, agreed that he had not returned my phone calls, even agreed that I was told I would not be charged on my card.  This business owner simply seeks profits and will not accept any responsibility for his poor hiring choices.    I do not suggest giving them your credit card information - though I am sure the owner would really prefer sticking to cash sales anyway given his interest in profits.",

    "text": "You get what you pay for: relatively inexpensive pizza -- and it tastes like it.  We ordered a white pizza, garlic knots & cheesecake from Gus's the other night. We wanted to try Gus's because we refuse to ever order from the chains: Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa John's and the like and wanted to find a new local spot.   About an hour later the delivery guy arrived, dropped off the pie, and right after he left, we realized they brought us the wrong pizza.   I called Gus's and was put on hold for about 5 minutes, the guy who answered the phone then told me that when they ring up orders they put the white pizza in the system the same exact way they ring up a cheese pizza and are expected to just tell the cook beforehand \"this one is a white pizza\" - he said he forgot to do this and he was sorry.  This system probably has failed them more than once before, so I hope that these mix ups and my review will encourage them to improve the way they ring up orders.   Anyway, hey, it's cool, we all make mistakes, life goes on. He told me he would talk to a manager to see if they could do anything and call me back in 5 minutes. I waited about 15 minutes and gave them a call back and asked to speak with the manager. The manager said they would deliver us the right pizza ... in about 45 minutes.   When we finally got our pizza, we were disappointed because it was just not good. Other reviews on Yelp mentioned that they serve up a greasy pizza and I didn't mind, but my girlfriend made sure to thoroughly sopp up the grease with a paper towel before trying it.   The garlic knots tasted like undercooked dough and weren't flavorful. They came with two little cups: corn syrup and canola oil disguised as tomato & garlic sauce. Yuck. The cheesecake was a thin slice in a package - it wasn't bad, but I am guessing that none of their desserts are homemade.   As these events unfolded and we tasted the food, I didn't feel like I just ordered from a local pizza place. It was a legitimately mediocre experience and we are bummed and are now back to our quest to find good local pizza spots.    To recap: the incorrect order, the lack of follow-through, the delay in rectifying the situation & mostly: the quality of the pizza and garlic knots are what makes this a 1-star pizza place.  To add insult to injury - after this experience, I came home to find that Gus's came in my neighborhood and jammed flyers in everyone's front door. Thank you for littering our complex with your junk mail...",
