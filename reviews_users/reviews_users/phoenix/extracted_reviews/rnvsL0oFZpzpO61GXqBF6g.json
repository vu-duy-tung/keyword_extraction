Outside of the buffet is does take a long time to get the food due to a small kitchen but it really is the best in town. The only issue is that the service not good. We would go a lot more often if the staff was more attentive, available, and cared about the customers. They stand at the bar with other ...with their backs facing us as they chat. Not okay.  The owner and chef is very attentive and caring but we have not found another staff member that has allowed us to have a good experience. I think if that was fixed .... there would be lines waiting to get in for the incredible food! Despite the staff issue ....I highly recommend them.",

    "text": "'Sorry it's a shit show tonight', the greeter said shortly after we were FINALLY acknowledged. That should have been our cue to leave. We walked in the door and waited for at least 3-5 mins before being acknowledged. The staff walked by us several times and didn't even take 15 seconds to say we will be right with you. Instead two of the staff talked amongst themselves about us waiting there and where they could sit us. It wasn't until after this awkward conversation that they actually said they would seat us in a minute. We were seated after about a 10-15 min wait which I think is acceptable.   We were brought water and they took our drink order. Drinks came out quickly but after that moment we didn't have anyone come to our table for at least 45 mins time. At this point we were out of drinks and water. We sat out of water for some time. After what I believed to be nearly an hour I got up to go ask if they had started our food yet or were cooking the rice grain-by-grain (jk). They were obviously having some issues because the counter/bar area was lined with bussed dishes. They said our food was about to come out in just 5 minutes so we decided to wait it out. Food did arrive within 5 mins, however it was not as promised by the sign on the table. The sign said it would be worth the wait, but I feel at least half the dishes left something to be desired. They completely forgot the potatoes in a curry (which was highly disappointing but I wasn't about to wait another hour for a potato to come out of that kitchen) and another dish had noodles that were stuck together like a 'noodle steak'. The flavors were alright, but having eaten at many Thai places it was NOT worth the experience we had. I've been to curry places that serve better tasting curries and you are in and out in 10 mins.   Overall, I could maybe look past the wait time if the food was better. I could also look past the food and the wait time combined if the staff was more professional and accommodating. You could obviously tell they were stressed and frazzled, but having some professionalism and trying to provide good customer service goes a long way.   Given this experience, we won't be back...plus there are plenty of other Thai places in Phoenix where we definitely don't have to wait 2 hours for food, especially when the curry is missing potatoes.",

We have been here numerous times and the food is excellent but the staffing problem is bad enough that I don't think we are going to go back now. Last night we attempted to go in at six and were told it would be a 40 minute wait before they could even take our order because they had a lot of to go orders and those came first. Talk about poor customer service! I see on here that this happens quite a lot so they may want to look into getting some staff that care about customer service because the ones they have there right now could care less. We ended up at Sala Thai on 32nd and noted that a couple of people that had gone in after us and left ended up here too.",

This place has the typical kitsch decor, lit with IKEA lantern style lamps. I am not complaining, I am merely saying that these people focus on what works and not pretending to be something they are not.   I had a curry and I ordered to a 3  (out of 5) in spiciness because I didn't feel like sweating this evening, but boy was I mistaken. A 3 was about what I could handle.. while downing ice water and panting like a dog. But it was good. Oh, it was really good. Having been to Thailand, I must say that I have eaten food there that was very similar to what I had here. I was impressed and I will return to this location.   The rest of my party also enjoyed their food a great deal. It does help that it is a family establishment, that runs a skeleton crew. Their product is more the food than the experience, but the experience is the food.   After eating I was heading to my concert, but I really needed a nap.   Tips. * Yes, this is the place. Go inside.  * Remember that if you ask for spicy, you will get it.  #PoundSign",

I have been to so many places that I have asked for 5/5 spicy and it wasnt anything to rave about. Here, you better be careful because their spice isnt messing around I can barely get a 2/5 here.

We shrugged it off and sat down. The food was pretty decent.. especially given the fact that it was the last few servings of buffet and had most likely been sitting there for a while. What made me give this restaurant a low rating wasn't the food.. or the location. It was the poor service. Three to four staff members on the floor, none of which came to take drink orders, clear plates, refill our very obviously empty waters, or check in on us. They just stared at us or talked to each other. When we finished eating, i waited for a while, and finally got up to ask if i could pay... lol! Very odd vibes at this restaurant. The food wasn't bad but there are way better thai places in phoenix if you're looking for more than a B+ meal with a D- atmosphere.",

I ordered a shrimp dish and there weren't very many shrimp but it has become the norm to skimp on the shrimp these days so I wasn't about to complain.  Egg rolls were very average, nothing special about those. Overall a good place since there's nothing comparable in the area.  When I go back I'll revise my review accordingly.",

We came here on a Wednesday night - we were seated right away and the service was very friendly and attentive.    The atmosphere is nothing fancy but is colorful and happy and you can actually hear yourself talk.  If you are into sports they even have TVs at the bar to catch a game.  We ordered the egg rolls - crispy and flavorful with an amazing sweet and sour sauce. I would have eaten a whole platter. For a starter I would get 2 per person as they are on the smaller side.  The we got the plain fried rice (level 1 hot) - amazing!!! Huge chunks of tender chicken, crisp green beans, yum!   We also got the green pineapple curry - with chicken (level 2 hot). Really good. With bamboo, peppers, etc. The sauce was nice and thin and fresh - perfect for drizzling over the white rice it comes with.   There were two of us and we had enough leftovers for lunch the next day.   Amazing!!!!   But beware of their spice levels and go with their recommendations!  I wouldn't go higher than level 2 and I like hot! Lol.",

    "text": "I was recently in the mood for Thai and stumbled upon this place on Yelp, which happened to be the only place that I found that has a lunch buffet. Since it was Sunday, it was $11.99 per person instead of the weekday pricing of $10.99.  Since I didn't want to spend the rest of the day suffering from food coma, I chose to do the take-out per pound. I got about $16 worth of Thai food which lasted an amazing 4 meals! Talk about getting bang for your buck! What's great about the take-out is that they have different types of containers so you can separate your dry stuff (noodles) from the wet stuff (curries). Being the stereotypical Asian that I am, I skipped the rice (hey, rice is cheap and you can make that at home) and went straight for the entrees.  For the curries, I tried the panang and massaman, the latter of which was better. Loved the peanut flavor in combination with the potatoes and chicken. I also tried to the flat broad noodle (I believe it was their version of Pad See Ew) which was OK and didn't have much in it aside from the noodles themselves. Perhaps it was towards the end of that batch and everyone else had taken the meat and veggies - who knows? I also tried the eggplant with tofu and the fish - both of which were pretty good. As opposed to other Thai restaurants that I've tried, they've definitely toned down the spiciness of the buffet options which is understandable considering they're catering towards a much larger crowd - just something to keep in mind in case you like ridiculously spicy Thai food. You may want to order a la carte if that's the case.  I enjoyed the food here and would come here again as prices as very reasonable - it's just too bad that it's 20 something minutes away from where I live!",

We lucked out that the condo we rented was down the street from this restaurant. one evening we drove by and the restaurant was packed! we decided to go the next night and are VERY happy we did. We were immediately warmly greeted when we arrived and ushered to a very nice table. For the dinner serving there is regular menu, no buffet, (which I'd rather have). we were waited on by the owner and his Uncle Ott. they were both very helpful and engaging. we ordered the Pad Thai, and Pad See Yew. both dishes were amazing, and so much food, we couldn't finish the servings. we are in a different state, but when we are in Phoenix, we will return to Reign Of Thai.",

    "text": "Came here for the lunch buffet on a friend's recommendation. I'ld never been to a Thai buffet and figured it would be a great way to sample all the different curries and Thai dishes I love. The outside of the building is not enticing (hence the 4 stars). Driving by you would probably pass it up because it's located right next to a mechanics garage. Overlook this and give it a try. When you walk inside from the bright sun it seems a bit dark because only one wall had windows. I like lots of natural light and so I asked for a table by the windows. They were a bit reluctant because the only table available was a 5 top and there were only 2 of us. Fortunately we came after the lunch crowd rush so they let us have it. The inside is kind of warehouse industrial with the exposed ceilings. Everything is painted black in the ceiling so it doesn't look unfinished. I've learned in all my years not to judge the food by the decor and also  because it was recommended by a friend.   So glad I kept an open mind because this was a real treat! They had all the curries in the buffet...Massaman, Panang, green, yellow, and coconut. I believe they all had chicken in them if I remember correctly.   My friend is skinny and decided to honor her figure and not do the buffet. In my opinion a Big mistake. She chose the Massaman and that's all she got. I got to savor and enjoy ALL of them and more for the same price! My favorites were the Massaman and yellow. Of course they had Pad Thai and Pad See-Ew and some other stir fried dishes. Think there were 2 different soups. Everything I tried I enjoyed. I soon ran out of room to try anything else. I was over the moon with the curries.  My only disappointment was with the Thai Tea. I wish restaurant owners would stop using their coffee brewers to brew tea and have a designated tea brewer only. You guessed it, my tea also tasted of coffee. I am particularly picky because I am one of few Americans who don't like coffee. Also why I gave 4 stars.   This restaurant is a long way from where I live in the valley but if in the area I would definitely stop in again!",

We hadn't been there for a while and I was definitely not disappointed. Food always tastes fresh and (there is a warning on each table) each dish is individually made. This can be slightly annoying since the food is sent out as soon as it is finished--not all at once, so my grandson had his teriyaki chicken while I just got to sit and salivate for a few more minutes. On this occasion, we started out with Thai toast as an appetizer. You get 8 pieces and everyone seems to like it. I'm somewhat embarrassed (and my family makes fun of me) but in 3 years,  the only dish I have ever ordered is the Pad Thai. Granted, I do sample from other people's plates, but I come here specifically for that dish--my idea of Thai perfection. I stuffed myself and still couldn't finish the hefty portion. I can assure you that  PadThai at 5 am tastes just as good as a breakfast food.",

Upon walking in we were told you \"You cant eat here, we close in a half hour you can only order take out\". No hi or welcome.  We asked if we could sit at the bar and quickly eat since we were in a hurry.  The gentleman told us \"yea, if you don't mind sitting next to these dirty dishes.\" Who says that to a customer? I really wanted to try the food because the reviews here are awesome.  We ordered yellow curry.  Asked how the heat was and he really couldn't explain it.  He was not nice at all, rather annoyed we were here 30 min prior to close. I ordered it medium and waited.  No water was offered while we waited or any beverage order for that matter.  Our food was done at 3 and he proceeded to pack it up to go.   I've never felt so unwelcome at a restaurant in all of my life. We intended on eating out and running errands, but having been forced to take out we took it home.   Curry flavor was delicious but mostly veggies hardly any chicken. Super disappointed in the treatment we received and for that I'm afraid we will not be returning.",

I can't comment on the regular menu, but the buffet is amazing.  The couple next to me was so excited to find out that I was a first time visitor.  They stared at me when I sampled my first bite, and they couldn't keep their excitement contained to find out what I thought.  It was as wonderful as they had suggested.  The couple eats there three times a week.  I don't want to eat anywhere three times a week, but I can totally understand why you would be tempted.  I'm hooked, and I've only been there once.",

We tried calling several times to order to-go and were only answered by a \"voicemail is full\" message. We decide to drive the 15 minutes. We finally arrive at 7:20 only to be ignored completely. 2 people directly behind the counter never made eye contact and were standing 3 feet away from them. One server and one young lady seemingly just handing food to the server and handling the tickets. Everyone working there seems to be mad at each other. Said young lady even threw a ticket at what seemed to be a bus lady. The waiter asked this young lady several times if our group was eating out or dining in only to be completely ignored. It wasn't that she couldn't hear him. We were much further away than she was. Shortly after 7:30 we were finally approached by the young lady and she only said \"you guys are eating out right?!?\". Obviously implying that they close in less than 30 minutes and don't want to seat another table. We were informed that the food would take at least 50 minutes and that they just stop answering the phones when they're busy before close. WELL THEN PICK UP THE PHONE AND TELL US. These people obviously have no customer service skills. I've eaten here before and the food is sub-par and service is lax but never bad enough to write a review. Never eating here again though.",

The lunch buffet is delicious even thought we expected a bit more of variety. The food was hot and had so much flavor. I never had curry before until this place and it was so good! The service was amazing, the manager I believe was very attentive to our water glasses and would take our dirty plates in an instant. I wish i could say that about other places. Will be back for sure!",

I don't want this place to be packed all the time so I hesitate to review but it would not be fare to say...Well done!",

Each dish is flavorful and delicious, and I'm personally in love with the decor. Gold paint and glittery floors? Yes please! My parents live in Prescott and they'll purposely find reasons to come visit just to get that Thai food. And it's the only Thai buffet I've found, other than the Pink Pepper. I recommend the Rad Nah and panang curry. Warning though, they don't mess around when it comes to heat. At most Thai places I'll order a 3 level heat and have no problem, the 3 I got at RoT was so hot I could barely eat it (but eat it I did 'cause deliciousness, but my stomach and tongue were NOT happy and it took three meals to eat it all lol)  Def check them out, they're a True hidden gem!",

Everyone that worked there was very friendly, attentive, and helpful. We all enjoyed the food, no complaints. Thai tea was authentic and delicious as well.

I'm usually the guy that orders off the menu and asks for \"Thai Hot\" which is usually followed by \"Thai Hot?\" then my reply is \"Yes, just as you would eat it\" with disbelief on the servers part as my order heads back to the kitchen.  However, this being a lunch buffet, it's obvious to say the spice needs to be palatable for most diners in the establishment. The atmosphere was nice and staff very attentive, just maybe a bit lacking in clearing the plates from the table, but otherwise no issues.   I tried a few different items from the buffet, Pad Thai, Yellow Curry Chicken, Spicy Chicken and Green beans, Spring Roll, and Coconut Chicken Soup. All the dishes were flavorful and had a slight kick to them. I'm sure you could as for extra spice on the side if you needed more, but everything was satisfactory.  I'd recommend it for a good lunch and I will be back to order off the menu at a later date.",

We asked him if it was a level 1 and said it was spicy but he responded with \" Oh it's just naturally spicy .\" Like he didn't want to take it bake remake it. The other guy was nice and said I'm sorry for everything.",

What I noticed is that a lot of the curries there had thickened up after being out for so long.  It really changed the texture of the curry to something I couldn't get excited about.  I've seen the picture from others here and the curry I had that day just wasn't the same consistency.  The pad thai was a no-go.  After sitting out for so long the noodles had turned into a soggy mess.  It's just not a dish that you can eat an hour after making.  The food isn't bad, but with each bite I just kept wondering what it would be like as a fresh item ordered from the menu.  I'll probably give it another shot and order direct or arrive for the buffet right as they open.  I felt like I hadn't really gotten this restaurants \"best shot.\"  Nice open design, very friendly staff, nice mix of customers.",

I wanted to try the buffet, so I went on a Sunday right after they opened. Typical Thai  \"most popular\" entrees are offered under heat lamps, like you'd expect, along with two soups, vegetable egg rolls and WonTons wrapped chicken/pork.  The Pad Thai was a disaster, tasting of dried red curry powder and ketchup (ever wonder where the sweetness comes from?), and the Panang Curry was a thick, strangely flavored, heavily red-curry influenced mess with a seemingly total absence of creamy coconut milk.  Some of the other noodle dishes were passable, fried rice was OK and (strangely) the won-tons were the best and freshest thing I had there.  Staff was very nice, and it was busy. I hope for the sake of everyone working there that this was an off-day, otherwise I cannot fathom why this buffet commands such a high rating.",

After the meal we both waited over 25 minutes for refills that we requested 4 times. The two employees were too busy trying to get us out the door than to actually listen to what we were requesting. We would start asking for more drinks and get interrupted with the same \"small kitchen, we are busy\" explanation. This is especially disappointing at a place that serves spicy food.

The flavor is there but the spice was so much that I couldn't even really enjoy the food. The Thai tea was really good, but I only managed to eat a few bites of the food before I gave up. There was only one waitress to service the whole restaurant so the service was slow.   Our bill was average to other Thai restaurants. I left having a slight stomachache because my belly couldn't take how spicy the food was. If you're into spicy food, definitely come and check this place out. If not, go somewhere else.",

Having been to Thailand and experiencing authentic Thai cuisine, the food at Reign of Thai is spot on. Their menu is huge and provides many different flavor combinations. If you're a vegetarian like me, you can get most of their dishes prepared with tofu or vegetables instead of meat. Their serving dishes are beautifully shaped and painted. We've never been during buffet hours, but we've heard the buffet is excellent. The value for your money is great considering the quality of the ingredients and healthy portion sizes. When ordering your food, the server always asks what level of spiciness you'd like (1-5). They definitely know spicy food, so anything higher than a 2 is very hot!  I had the opportunity to meet the owner, Satsay, the last time we dined at Reign of Thai. He was very welcoming and spoke with pride about the quality of their food. He and his wife go shopping daily to pick up fresh ingredients from a variety of locations.  Thank you Reign of Thai for providing a consistently great dining experience!",

    "text": "Holy monkeys ! Be prepared to have your taste buds burned off ! I was so excited to try them based off of their reviews ! Unfortunately was not warned (and hadn't read) about their spiciness being a little over the top .  I'm one that can normally handle a 4 . But tonight went for a 3 on my pad-se-ew and my mom did a 2 on her pad Thai . I'm glad I went down one ! Mine was barely tolerable and had tears running down my cheeks .. my mom was coughing and gave up a few bites in .  It was a great flavor but disappointing that we could only get a quarter of it down without feeling sick . Definitely would like to have been warned they run on the higher side .  Another downer was we had taken it to go and had ordered their $2 cucumber salad side and it came in a dipping sauce cup . For $2 I feel like you should be getting more .  I'll definitely try them again , just maybe at a 1.5 spiciness !",

    "text": "The food was good, pretty average thai food. The service was terrible. The first thing we ordered was two Ozeki Sake Bombers (which she was confused about and idk why because it's on the menu and we showed her)and then our food (curry and pad thai). We waited and nothing, I got my food first then about 5 minutes later my friend got his. No drinks, so I asked the waitress about our drinks and she made an expression like she forgot and ran over to the bar. We were done eating when she brought over one regular beer bottle and one sake shot and then looked at us questionably, 'like did I get it right?'. We explained to her what a sake bomb was and that we needed another one. She brought over the same thing no glasses still. We took our shots and wrapped up our food and asked if we could get just the shots comped and not the beers, and she made us both uncomfortable asking for such a thing. I felt justified considering it was the first we ordered and the last thing we got and I only asked for part of her mistake to be paid for. Very upsetting that she and her manager who made her go back and forth while we could see her to argue with us, would not do anything about their service. So here I am writing a review.",

The Thom ka gai (coconut soup w chicken) was outstanding with lots of flavor. Everyone asked for more until the pot was empty. Curries were equally tasty. They take your \"hot\" seriously with a 3 out of 5 being fairly generous on the hot.  Thai steak was a T-bone an Inch thick. Pad Thai and chow mein were huge. You could order family Ste a few dishes for 6 and still have leftovers. Highly recommended  this restaurant for its quaintness (hole in the wall) and the owner's attention to service. A wonderful family restaurant run by a family.",

It's located in a small and tight location (blink and you'll miss it) with limited parking, but don't let that deter you.  Once inside you will experience a pleasant decor.  Friendly staff, great service and excellent Thai food. Their lunch buffet (Tues - Fri & Sunday.) offers a good selection of house dishes and soups. The dinner menu offers a large variety of traditional Thai dishes cooked to order with fresh ingredients and nice presentation. My favorites are the Papaya Salad appetizer, Red, Green or Mas-Sa-Mun curry's, and their wonderful noodles dishes; Pad-Thai, Pad-See-Yew & Spicy Noodles. If you like your food spicy a 2 or 3 on the Thai spice level will do for most. Any hotter should be eaten at your own risk!  We finish off our meal with a Fried Banana Ice Cream or the Coconut Ice Cream for dessert.  Beverages include Thai Ice tea, soda's a good selection of beer, wine and alcoholic beverages.  FYI, they are CLOSED on Mondays!!!",

Selection was good and there were more offerings than I had expected.  My favorite buffet items were the pad thai, string beans with chicken, green curry, and the veggie dish.    Service was fine for us but it was maybe not the most professional or organized.  When one of the waiters brought the wrong dish out to the table next to us, he seemed very flustered.  Instead of just apologizing for the mistake, he instead said it wasn't his fault but the fault of the person who took the order.  The people at that table didn't seem to mind, but I just thought it was a strange response by the waiter.  All in all the experience was very good.  As long as they still offer the buffet I will be back again since all-you-can-eat Thai food is such a rare find.",

I gave it 4 out of 5 because I had to call six times before anyone answered the phone to place our order for pickup.  We ordered the yellow and green curry (level1) and the crab puffs. The food was delicious, my only complaint is that they didn't give enough rice to go with the amount of curry ordered.  Prices were good for the amount of food we received.  Definitely order level 1 if you're not much for spicy as it made my nose run. Anything spicier would have been too much for us.  Overall great place to eat.",

Impeccable service, it is a bit slow but we live in such a fast pace world, enjoy it. Maybe ask about how your party's day was like?   Highly recommend Tom yum soup, great presentation and plentiful. The cashew chicken is incredible...we added pineapple to offset the spiciness, the sweet & hot is a nice mixture. The pad Thai, awesome.   We LOVE Thai, but was even warned at a spice 3. HOT, HOT, HOT! But so good. I mastered the art of eating as fast as I could before the pain set in. Anything above, don't forget your nunchucks.",

The server was very helpful and adviced me that they skip \"mild\" and go straight to medium on their heat scale  (which is a 1). I ordered my tom kha at a level one and I'm so glad i did. It had the perfect amount of kick to it. The only thing I wish the server did for me was tell me that the tom kha served 4 people and was $16.00. I came here to eat by myself and ended up with this GIANT thing of soup. I had to invite a friend to come eat it with me. But the soup was the best tom kha I've ever had. The broth was coconuty and creamy and you could taste the lemon grass and all the flavors. Yes ,  the service is slow. But the food is worth it",

I guess they assumed we were eating the buffet but since we aren't regulars, we wanted to know choices. Service was very sketchy throughout the entire meal. The food was sub-par. The chicken fried rice had very little flavor and, as another reviewer pointed out, the Pad Thai as well. The buffet had curry and chicken. Good luck finding any beef or any other flavor profile. The coconut chicken soup was just ok. I would not return. This is my first Yelp review which is a testament to how much I didn't care for this place.",

Have tried the the various curries (red curry = super yum) stir fries (basil curry, mmmmm!) and noodles, everything is super flavorful! One warning, the heat in the food is higher than what you usually get in Phoenix, order a level down if that is not your thing. Will keep coming back!!",

The food is delicious...you choose your spice levels for any dish.  The Rad Na (spelling?) noodles, the red or yellow curry, and the coconut soup are outstanding.  5 stars!  You can skip the wontons and the Thai toast appetizers.  We now laugh with the servers about it, but the only negative is that the food takes FOREVER to be served.  It comes out one dish at a time, so if you are with a big group, it is a wonderfully slow dinner.  The soup may be the last dish to appear or the first...you never know.  The inside of this restaurant is unexpected.  Cute and clean.  Bring your own wine or beer and there is no corkage fee.  They will bring you a big ice bucket, corkscrew, whatever you need.  Come when you are not in a hurry.  Come and enjoy this delicious, authentic Thai food!",

Thai cuisine is a staple in our family of two...we eat out for it, we cook a lot of it...so we know what we like and how we like it. So of course, we ordered our two favorite dishes - pad see ew and yellow curry. 5/5 on both dishes I have to say. We were able to customize spice level and dietary restrictions. We were able to make the curry vegan and take out the fish sauce! Love how accommodating the chef and servers were! I didn't get a chance to ask about the buffet and whether or not it was veg friendly - but next time we come in for dinner, we'll be inquiring for sure.   Location was interesting. Right off a main road and in an odd shaped parking lot. Didn't stop people from coming in that's for sure. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time, probably only seemed prolonged because we were quite hungry.   Also, The spice level is no joke. I initially asked for 3/5 but our server suggested I get a 2. It was definitely more than enough. I probably could've went for a 1/5 to be quite honest. Happy that our server knew what she was feeding us!   We'll be back here pretty soon!!",

He was doing a great job keeping up with the crowd though! Was always on the move, but still provided us great service. I usually go for red curry with tofu but I ended up getting masaman curry with tofu. It was very tasty and I liked it! The onions in it were nice and sweet. Peanuts added a nice crunch too. I think I would've liked the red curry a little better though. My experience was good, but I felt bad because my boyfriend did not have the same.

The restaurant located in Cave Creek, which is a little far from our house.   Food: They have many signatures dishes which is really good, but limited. They have tom kha soup, yellow curry, wonton that I recommend is a must try. However, the pad thai with me is a little bland.   Price: $11.99 I believe so. Overall, it's a reasonable price.  Service: Nice and friendly, no complaints since I'm a picky person with people's attitudes lol  We will most likely return since me and my husband really enjoyed the food here.",

When I said something to the waiter, he laughed and said their medium is a 1 on a scale of 1-5.  Would've been nice to know before ordering.  If a 1 is medium spice level, then there must not be a mild option?!  Won't go here again.  Besides the lack of being able to taste my food, I waited a long time for a drink refill of iced tea which they do limit the number of refills for iced tea (silly and ridiculous).",

Well there were 7 of us and very little went home with us.  The waiter we had was a little jittery only because it was his first night, he did a fantastic job.

WARNING - the food was waaaay spicier than 2 and the wife couldn't eat more than a couple bites.  It even had me sweating a little - I made a comment to the waiter and he proudly told me they use fresh ground peppers and their 3 was a 5 at other places.  That's great and all - but a little up front warning would be nice since we did say we wanted to keep it mild.  For dishes, we had pad Thai and green pineapple curry.  Quality was good and the curry made for great leftovers.  Still, I felt the food overall was average and didn't come close to unseating Siam as my favorite Thai food in the valley - I suppose I'd give 3.5 stars if I could.",

Clearly I can't recommend Reign of Thai's soups more.   On to the noodles. The Pad Thai is always a good point of comparison, and sadly, Reign of Thai's Pad Thai was a major swing and a miss. It was waaaay too sweet, lacked any kind of complex flavor, and even my kid said it was gross and wouldn't eat it. Yuck.   The Pad See Ew was ok, but nothing special. It was edible, at least.   Larb is one of our very favorite dishes and sadly, this white girl makes a far better larb in her own kitchen. It majorly lacked one of the signature flavors of larb: toasted rice powder. It's like they skimped on it. Not cool.   They also really skimped on the service. Awful. Just awful. Aside from actually carrying our dishes to our table, there was literally no service. He never checked on us which made it difficult to ask where our missing dish was. It also left us very thirsty.  All in all, Reign of Thai offered a good soup experience and I'd come back for those. But only those. Otherwise, it's not worth the trip if you're looking for an authentic, high quality Thai meal.",

We arrived right when they started their buffet , 11:30am, and the place was sort of empty. By the time we left, the place was packed.  We tried the pad tai, chicken Panang, spicy basil chicken, the vegetable rolls and the coconut soup and everything tasted so good.  We also ordered fresh shrimp rolls because my wife loves them.

We found this nice restaurant on Yelp also. The service is always great because all the servers are helping each other on every table. Sometimes the server A may come to ask you if you need more drinks or anything else. No matter you say yes or no. After the server A left, the server B or C might come over to ask you the same questions again. This is not because the servers aren't communicating with each other, this is showing each of them isn't just care about his or her own table and tips! This what we called the team work to make the service better than others. Let's talk about the food. I only have tried a few dishes so far because I stick with the same certain dishes when I like them. The dish that I usually order is the fresh rolls with shrimp and tofu for appetizer and the fresh ginger with chicken for main entree. They are both yummy! The price isn't too bad at all.  The only thing that we need to get use to is they close in the afternoon for few hours and reopen at 5PM. If you would like to check out their food. You will need to check on their opening hours first.",

    "text": "By far one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix. I have never had a single complaint and we have been here a countless number of times.   The staff is friendly and professional. They are always welcoming and provide awesome service. They really take pride in their work and are a big reason why we will keep coming back.  Their food is phenomenal! Fresh ingredients, large portions, distinct and flavorful sauces, and SPICE. We always ask for our food to be \"thai hot\" and most places hardly ever give us anything hotter than a 2 or 3. Reign of thai gives you exactly what you ask for, every time. If you can't handle spicy food don't ask for anything higher than a 1 or 2 here.   During their lunch hours they do a buffet. This allowed us to try a variety of the different dishes they have to offer, including their spicy eggplant dish which has become a personal favorite of mine. Another great thing about the buffet is they allow you to take it to-go by charging by the pound. Try not to go too late (right before they close for the afternoon). They are sometimes out of certain dishes by this point, which is to be expected.   We've ordered food to-go here several times as well. We're never left waiting very long for the food to be cooked and it comes out just the way we ordered it each time.  If you are ever looking for a place to eat great thai food in Phoenix don't miss the opportunity to try Reign of Thai. You won't be disappointed.",

We have since moved about 20 minutes away and the last two times we came to order take out the food was so unbelievably spicy that we weren't able to eat it. It's beyond frustrating when a place you've eaten at for over a year suddenly makes a level 1 dish so spicy that it ends up in the trash can. We've wasted over $100 in two trips at this point and I can't justify trying it again. So frustrating. I just don't see what the point in making the lowest spice level on the scale something that is inedible to somebody who can tolerate a little heat.",

The interior has a bit of an \"unfinished\" feel, but upon being seated at our table and having a look around it takes on a charm of its own. We started with Thai fish cakes that were flavorful with a nice cucumber salad on the side that added a welcome brightness. The food... A word of warning, specify your heat level, Thai food can get rediculously spicy hot! Our server asked us how hot we would like it and I'm a fan of a bit of brow sweat while not over powering heat, so I chose \"medium heat\" which amounts to a Thai heat level of level one! I had the Drunken Noodle with chicken and shrimp, no bell pepper. The flavor was spot on, absolutely wonderful. Four plump shrimp and a proper amount of chicken, making for a satisfying meal. l I almost had to take home leftovers, but it was so tasty I ended up eating it all with no room for dessert! (NOTE: I am compelled to mention an aside on meat portions of \"Asian style foods\" in general. I get tired of reading reviews that complain of not enough meat in their dishes. Sure, we love our 14+ ounce steaks, but where we eat meat as the main ingredient of a plate it is more of a garnish in Asian dishes due to costs and availability in other countries. Now back to the review!) My wife had the Spicy Green Bean with beef. Of course I had to have a taste, the aroma coming off the plate was alluring... Just a great flavored dish! We complimented our meals with a couple of Sapporo and I cannot wait to go back! The menu has something for everyone; vegetarian, fish, meat, rice, noodles... I want to try it all!",

It started when I asked our waiter to tell me more about one of the dishes and he refused, saying that in all restaurants all waiters are always trained to say every single dish is the most amazing. The wait for our food was very long, and when my Pad See Ew finally came, the noodles were completely overlooked, the scrambled egg was burnt, and there was no sauce whatsoever. When I told the waiter this, he told me \"this is how we make it here.\" (Another person at my table ordered the same thing and had both sauce and not burnt egg...) My husband had ordered an entree with beef that had maybe 1-2 ounces of actual meat in it, and the waiter's response to that was \"we put in five ounces.\" Not \"I'm sorry\" or anything like that, merely a statement indicating that we were lying.  I have two stars because other people at or table had good food; my experience was definitely marred by the waiter's rudeness.",

We were quite surprised when a number one was actually pretty spicy... Really the upper limits of our tolerance. Therefore, we decided we would have gone for a point five instead of a one! So unless you like very very spicy, I would ask for a half a point! The atmosphere is basic... As other people said, casual. Not much to it. Otherwise I would have given them a five star rating.

After telling them about the tofu in my curry a different girl told me it was supposed to taste that way. For anyone who eats tofu on a regular knows it isn't supposed to taste sour. We get our bill and they tried to charge for the food we didn't even eat! When I went to go pay for what our kids actually ate, the girl at the register tried to argue with me about it. If I had a choice to give 0 stars I would. This place needs to learn how to treat people and take a good look at the product they're ordering and how to prepare it properly if they ever want to be successful. Don't waste your time or money!",

This little restaurant is hidden next to an automotive shop and you'd barely guess it was there if you weren't looking for it. It's cute inside and the waitstaff is nice and friendly.  We ordered the fried squid for an appetizer, the vegetable fried rice, and an eggplant dish with chicken and the green curry with squid. We ordered everything as a 3 on the heat scale except for the green curry-that we ordered in a 4.  The 4 will bring tears to your eyes while the 3 is perfect.  It will make you need to blow your nose a bit, but it's deliciously hot instead of murderous. The eggplant dish was amazing, the green curry was delicious!  I would say that I wasn't a huge fan of the fried squid OR the squid in the curry--too chewy for my taste.  But the flavors are there for sure.  After the amazing flavor of the two main dishes, the vegetable fried rice was slightly boring, but I don't think that's the fault of the fried rice-I think it's just that the main dishes were simply too good. I could easily eat here once a week forever and be happy.",

I have also come here for regular dinner, which in my experience was even better than the buffet; no surprise there, as that is the general trend in restaurants that offer lunch buffets. After a long hiatus from visiting this restaurant, I tried their  lunch buffets two more times and things have changed. The food is OK but not great, and the variety that was the big draw for me in the past was no longer there. The fried rice is still good, the pad thai (only one kind instead of two from my past visits) was on the bland side, and the remaining dishes were mostly just tofu and chicken - good proteins, definitely, but gone are the mussel and fish dishes that I had enjoyed in the past buffets. I would definitely come here again, but when I do, it will be for the regular (non-buffet) lunch or dinner. Service remains friendly and the buffet price is still good.",

There are a relatively large variety of choices, including several types of curry (from non-spicy to moderate spicy), seafood (like mussels and fish), main food (like pad thai, fried rice, wontons), and assorted veggies. They don't look very fancy, but are just tasty, which also gives you a hint of a real Thai flavor. Services are ok and kind of efficient. The only thing I would suggest is that the Thai tea is a little too sweet even with lots of ice. For $11.99 per person, it is really worth the money and the time you spend there with friends and family. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "OMG!!!! this is one of the most AWESOME buffett that I have been to and the only Thai one EVER IN MY LIFE!!!   Start with the size: deceptive of how big it is from the outside. I was thinking a small place but inside is a full bar and atleast 12-15 four person tables and 2 sets of 8 person tables.   The buffett: homemade taste and heartfilled energy that goes with it. 16 dishes to try from pad thai to currys( red green yellow) tofu diahes too. 2 soups today is coconut chicken with HUGE mushrooms killee flavor but not overpowering heat. The Tam Yum is amazing the base of that soup per my spouse is a sweet carrot tase with the Tam Yum flavor. She said it makes her feel like a little kid and makes her tummy feels good. The steamed rice is dry for me that is not my favorite but for my spouse loves it. I have to admit I like my rice soft and wet or sticky so this rice ia ok but like I said a personal preference.   Drinks: Thai ice tea rocks water at table before we even sat down from getting food off the buffett.  Coke and teas available but didn't get one.   For this level of food for 2 people 21.98,drinks 5.18 and tax 2.34 =29.50 is a great price.   Will be back for sure even if its not for the buffett cause the flavor is that good.",

So there was supposed to be a fish dish, but they refilled the eggs rolls and the fried wonton like twice instead. So you can see what they want you to stuff yourself up with first.

Mom and I were amazed by the mosaic of flavorful dishes the buffet provided. In addition to there being a thai food BUFFET. How often do you find those?  We love thai food and we weren't the least bit disappointed. The staff members were attentive to our tables and to other tables. There was a mad rush of customers as soon as it opened-with very good reason. You have to wait for the food to be replenished but HEY it's a buffet and it's well worth the wait. And what can you expect, with hordes of patrons waiting for a single dish?  Fantastic place.",

Soups, Curry's, rice, noodles, fried rice, veggies   First Thai buffet I've seen anywhere. Really enjoyed everything about this place. It's next to a tire shop and looks like a hole in the wall. Then you walk into a blossoming room with great interior colors and atmosphere. Immediately you get a sense that the meal will deliver. And it does along with a friendly staff.  It's important to understand that a lunch buffet is not a gourmet meal nor a resort brunch. It's a lunch buffet and should be judged accordingly. The food is made in bulk and made to please the masses. So it can't be too spicy or intense. And I thought this place was a pleasant surprise that hit the spot and filled up a hungry couple who knows how to chow!  The variety was nice as there were about 12-14 items nice and hot. Half were curries of many varieties of meat and color which were all great. Yellow/red/green/spicy/pineapple/pork/beef/chicken. Nice variety of curry to say the least. I couldn't get enough.   Some of the meat was a bit over cooked for my liking but nothing that bothered me much or kept me from eating it. I suppose that has to be the way for folks to feel safe.   Otherwise it was awesome. The fresh food kept coming and the staff kept up nicely with replacing dishes and taking your dirty plates as well.   Thanks Reign if Thai can't wait to be back.   You won't be disappointed with this place! It's good times and the quality is good for a buffet.",

Once inside, it is surprisingly more spacious than it appears before you enter.   The serving crew seems nice and the food was fresh and relatively tasty, living up to the moderate expectations of most people's hopes for a Thai food restaurant, I would guess. I enjoyed it.  That said, the restaurant was relatively slow on refilling the buffet trays of essential ingredients. Chicken, pad thai, and rice all ran out and in a restaurant that was full seemed to have everyone waiting for some food to come from the kitchen.  The pricing was average and didn't surprise me as being too much or really low.  Overall, while the people and food seemed good enough to return, I doubt I ever will make another trip here. There are just too many good food spots to go to that seem to be more aware and attentive to have the food out and fully stocked.",

    "text": "Today was our third time at Reign of Thai, which is a pretty easily missed hole in the wall on northern Cave Creek. Parking is a bit of a challenge since it shares a lot with an auto repair store but we've never been unable to find parking. The restaurant feels much larger inside than it does when looking from the outside, its got a homie cabin feel with wood panelled walls and exposed rafter ceiling. Though a portion of the room is dedicated to their buffet (which is offered until they close for lunch Monday thru Friday and on Sundays for 11.99!)  My boyfriend grew up eating his grandmother's amazing Thai food, so he's incredibly picky but this place exceeded his expectations. And I definitely mean that they exceed, the first two times we came he ordered a 5 spice level and it was defibitely Thai hot. I've ordered their 4 and 3 but will admit that today I had to sink to lowly 2 spice level but finally found what was just right for me.   I ordered the Fresh Ginger chicken and found it perfect, the ginger had a great taste and the broth was delicious and not too sweet. My boyfriend got the panang curry with beef and added bamboo, he recieved a troph size dish of steaming spicy goodness. I tried a bite and found my whole mouth on tasty fire. After that I dipped bits of my order into his curry and thought it was amazing, in the end I added just a spoonful of the curry to my plate and enjoyed the light fresh sweetness of my dish with the robust spiciness of his. Fantastic!   We also ordered an appetizer of egg rolls that weren't anything special, though their dipping sauce was some of the best I've ever tried. I'd buy a bottle of that for toast haha.  I love that this place is clearly family run, the waiters were brothers and clearly knowledgable about each dish. They even ensure customers know that when they say spicy, they aren't kidding around! Definitely a great place to bring anyone who loves a good spicy meal, or given its location, its a fantastic place to have lunch after hitting up the localy antique stores or enjoying a Sunday drive down Cave Creek.  We will definitely be back, and next time I'm coming for that buffet",

The reason for four stars was just the outdated interior, super loud rumbling noise in the dining area (continuous like a generator was on top of us), and cleanliness.   5 starts for vegetarian pad Thai, chicken spring rolls, and yellow chicken curry. All were flavored as a \"1 star\" as their scale of spiciness is 0-2, unlike the menu suggests (1-5).   Location had a handful of parking spots so I imagine if the dining room were full it would be a more full lot.   Lastly, we came for the buffet but were misinformed about when it would be available. Definitely will be back for the buffet and will gladly update my review!",

The most delicious, perfectly spiced authentic Thai soups I've had since Nakhon Sawhon province,1973!!! Filled up a plate with a nice crisp egg roll, fried rice, noodles, and a beef curry. All were delicious. Next plate, tried the white rice, and a bit of each curry dish.  At least 8 different dishes. Everything was tasty, fresh and full of Thai flavor. We drove from Chandler, just to try this place due to Yelp reviews. Good decision. Place got full for lunch, but comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. Best Thai food in Phoenix area, imho.",

The food is amazing, but I am obsessed with the Drunken Noodle with tofu and don't often order anything other than this.   The staff can be incredibly friendly, and also standoffish. It depends on who's serving you. There are some people we love there, and others who make you feel less welcomed.   Tips to know when visiting -  Most of the sauces are made with fish sauce, including for vegetarian dishes. Just let your server know you are vegan, and they have other options. :-) Please don't be rude to them, though. It is common to name fish sauce as a vegetarian option in thai restaurants. I advise the people who gave such poor reviews for this to educate themselves on the food culture and be aware of different practices before getting upset that it's not convenient for them.   Lastly, the spice levels vary, and if you're a wimp like me go for level one!",

On 9/3/19 I placed a to go order at lunch around 1:47 pm for an order of spicy fried rice, spicy basil, spicy green beans with chicken and coconut soup with chicken, and one thai iced.

My family and I have eaten at this restaurant several times in the past but this experience has been the most disturbing and disgusting thing we've had seen personally. My brother had the coconut soup with chicken and decided to eat his soup later in the evening. The container wasn't opened until then so the lid was never opened. My brother realized after taken a few bites/sips of soup that there was a cockroach in the broth of the soup. He found 2! It was already too late to call the restaurant last night but we will be contacting them today and the food department to make sure someone does a proper health inspection before they end up getting people extremely sick/killed. I never like giving restaurants bad reviews [1 star] but this is disgusting. Please don't eat here and if you do, check your food completely before consumption.",

The waitress recommend 0.5 if we wanted mild and she was right. 0.5 was still bit spicy. Level 3 on our curry dish was very spicy.   We started off with lemon grass chicken soup. This was really good and the lemon grass gave good flavor in the broth. I noticed as the soup cooled, the saltier the broth became.   The beef and vegetables with garlic sauce was really good. I just wished it was less sweet and more garlicky.  Other than that, the ingredients were fresh, beef was tender, and good flavor.  The best part of the chicken curry was the potatoes. It was really tasty and the portion was huge; enough for leftovers.  Th pad Thai was really good too. Next time, I would spice down because 3 was really spicy.   Overall very nice meal. Just remember to go when you are not in a hurry. Or opt for their lunch buffet which I'm looking forward to trying.",

If you answered yes to at least one of these questions well look no further my friend, this place has you covered! I ordered the Shrimp fried rice with basil, since I'm a dare devil I ordered level 4 on the spicy meter. So you have an option of going all the way to Thai hot which is a 5 in this restaurant. The young lady was nice enough to tell me there level 4 is usually Thai hot for other establishments. Mmmm my mouth gets watery just of the thought of that spiciness! The plate came with 6 decent sized juicy shrimps and the rice was cooked to perfection not too hard and no mushiness here. After couple scoops my mouth was caliente caliente and my heart racing! I proceeded to take a sip of iced, refreshing, sweet Thai tea, so delicious! Brought me back to earth with all the savory spices in the air. Even if your not into the spiciness the flavors alone will have you entering a different world dimension! Don't take my word for it I highly recommend you to try this place for yourself. Hey! While your at it don't forget to invite me I'm more than happy to tag along!",

It was all superb. The best was the spicy chicken noodles and wontons.  Next came the currys...all of them, fantastic. The selections on the buffets are limited to mostly vegetarian and chicken dishes but it's still the best option to satisfy a Thai craving because of all the yummyness...

    "text": "First time here; went in on a Friday evening.  Parking lot is small and there was one spot left.  Restaurant was very busy, so we sat at the bar.  The sign by the front door said \"now serving beer and wine\", so if you were waiting for that addition, it has arrived.  We ordered the egg rolls, chicken satays, massaman curry, and garlic sauce.  I had 2 glasses of wine, and it was boxed wine, but this isn't a wine cafe so I'm not going to let that get me down.  Bottom line is this: service was excellent, and the food was the best Thai I've had in the valley to date.  I like my food spicy, and this place delivers.  (We ordered a hotness of 4, which is Thai hot).  The only flaw in the entire order of food was one of the larger potato pieces in the massman was undercooked.  But still, I cannot dock a star off the overall experience.  We will definitely be back.  Another positive I feel I should mention is that they have televisions... so now you can go on Sunday and catch some games while you eat :)",

A friend and I popped in for some tom ka gai soup and sweet and sour chicken on a weekday evening.  The soup was first rate, properly spiced, flavorful and full of tender chicken chunks.  The problem was with the sweet and sour chicken stir fry.  The chicken in that dish wasn't stir-fried, rather it appeared to have been deep fried several times over to the point where you could literally break and tooth chewing on it.  When I called it to the waiter's attention he copped on attitude with me, then tried to shame us for sending it back before eventually apologizing and offering to remove it from the bill.  And despite the over-staffing of this small place, the service was atrocious.  We were not greeted at the door when we arrived, and two different employees frowned at us while we were waiting to be seated.  Something's definitely wrong with this place!",

The dish had some spicy at a level 2 but it wasn't too spicy and it is great that you get to choose how spicy you want your food. My wife had the Mas-Sa-Mum curry which was the hit of the night. I ate more of her curry than I did of my noodles.  Our server, who I believe is one of the owners, encouraged us to come for one of the buffets to try an assortment of different dishes. She explained that the buffet consists of a large portion of the normal menu not a buffet menu. All in all a great dinning experience and will go back",

    "text": "All out 5 stars.  Too bad we waited so long to finally eat here.  We went late on a Sunday night.  We made it in just before they stopped seating according to some rules posted out front.  The staff was very friendly.  We interacted directly with 3 staff members that were present in the dining room.  The buffet was not available as late as we were there, but the menu was extensive.  I had the Spicy Noodles and, when asked about the 1-5 spicy scale, I told them \"as hot as you make it\".  My wife ordered the Crispy Fish at a 2 spicy.  My kids had the Teriake Beef at a 1 spicy and with fried rice.   As we waited for our order, two of the staff let me know that nobody had ordered a 5 all day so they had not called any ambulances.  I like spicy, but they did put a bit of fear into me with those statements.  Alas, the order came.  I tried everybody else's meals prior to tasting my own.  The fish was really good.  I didn't pick up on the spicy, really, but throughout the meal, my wife kept telling me that she coudn't believe I was eating a 5 since hers was so hot (and she likes hot).  The Teriaki Beef with fired rice was OUTSTANDING.  I will be ordering that dish next time, probably at a 3 or 4 spicy so as not to kill the flavor too much.  My Spicy Noodles dish, again, was OUTSTANDING.  Sure, it was hot, but the flavors of the beef and the bell peppers and some other spiced that were present still came through amongst that spice.  I always say that you can add pepper to anything and make it hot, but it takes a talented chef to still allow those other flavors to remain, and Reign of Thai's chef can do that very very well.  We are going back this week.  I have no doubts that we are going to enjoy being regulars here and I recommend that you give it a shot!",

Pad Thai was sub-par to me, but the chicken with pineapple curry was really good and filling.I did try some ginger chicken but way too hot, and I did keep choking on the lemongrass soup with the red peppers floating in it. The food, tho, is clean and plentiful--just a little hotter than this American taste can handle often. One negative is that there is no dessert at all on the buffet which surprised me, since I don't think I have ever been to a buffet with no offering for dessert.  Something would have been nice. One caveat:  Went on a hot Summer day for about 1.5 hours, and their electricity (lights, fans, etc.) went out about 8 times--but immediately went on again.  They must have someone standing there and flipping the switch at the electric box all the time. This is a good Thai place, tho, and if you like your hot at a 3-5 level you will just love this place. Unfortunately, I don't like it that hot.",

Chicken fried rice, pad Thai and red curry (spice level 1) were also at the table. All good, according to the party. Would definitely return but maybe choose spice levels one step down. Most Thai places I've been to in Utah that have a \"native hot\" (tends to be the highest on the scale) designation don't tend to serve food spicier than what I had at Reign.",

This place gets 5 stars because we didn't get sick at all! From the Panang to the Teriyaki to the egg fried rice, this place is awesome! My mouth is watering just writing about it!",

The Thai iced tea we got right away and was phenomenal, the tom Kah didn't come out until AFTER our very spicy Pad see Ew (we ordered a 1). Our Tom Kah finally came and it tasted like a 10 on their 5 scale.  Took over 10 minutes for a server to come by and we never got any refills. Was excited to try a new place and after reading the reviews thought it would be good. Unfortunately this placed missed the mark. A gentlemen agreed to take the Tom Kah off our bill after we asked hence the reason for 3 stars instead of 1",

I have driven by this place every day for years and for some reason we never stopped but tonight while we were on our way to another local Thai restaurant we decided to give it a shot and I am so glad we did.  The location and exterior are a little rough....it's on a busy corner next to AAMCO. Inside the place is quite charming. We were seated within moments by the owners son and he immediately took our drink orders. I went for the big fresh noodles with chicken and my husband a curry. Luckily they explained the spice level to us when ordering or I never would have survived my meal. My noodles had some serious heat at a 2 but they were delicious. We had ordered an appetizer (Thai toast) but it never showed. Ordinarily I would be seriously annoyed but there was so much food it they probably did us a favor. Despite the hiccup up of the missing appetizer the service was excellent. Everyone was very friendly and always checking on us without invading our space.  Don't go here expecting to get in and out in a rush. They warn you everywhere that their kitchen is small so you will need to be patient. It is most definitely worth the wait, so sit back and relax and enjoy!  Two entrees and a soda was just under $30.00.",

    "text": "The service at this restaurant started out good, with the waiting staff being courteous & prompt.   Our appetizer was the fairly standard fried egg rolls with chicken & vegetables (mostly shredded cabbage). The rolls were hot off the deep fryer. Their taste was typical.   The pad see ew with beef was good but the cook forgot to add chilies to bring the spiciness to medium as ordered. The wait staff realized the mistake but did not offer to take the dish back to the kitchen for correction. Instead, he brought out the tray of chilies so we could add ourselves. Somewhat disappointing behavior in my mind. In spite of the lack of chilies, the pad see ew itself was pretty good.   When the dish of chicken & cashews was brought out, the waiter spilled the sauce on my wife's side of the table. Quite a bit of sauce too. Yes, the full dish was heavy for holding with one hand; he had a large bowl of rice in the other hand. But why did he use a tray & a stand?   The waiter did apologize for the spill. But he did not offer to clean it up. So my wife had to use her napkin to clean up this spill.   The chicken cashew dish was a bit spicer, to my taste, than ordered. Maybe the cook overcompensated for forgetting to add chilies to the previous dish. Again the dish itself was pretty good.   Even though the waiters did check up on us and offered to top off our glasses of water often, their lack of professionalism and the errors of cooking our dishes cause me to give them an overall rating of 3/5.",

Sadly, anything with pasta (pad Thai and a wide noodle dish) was gummy and stuck together, not edible.   All other protein choices were primarily chicken dishes which all pretty much tasted the same. The mussels were good but again, overall, not much variety. There was a crowd so the food being served disappeared quickly.  Saw the server initially to take a drink order and never saw again. Had to walk over to the register to pay.",

I ordered the crab puffs as an appetizer and unlike many other places where the puffs are mostly cream cheese and a hint of crab these were equally proportioned and you could actually see and taste the crab! I also ordered the yellow curry with chicken- spice level 1 and it was delicious!! Just the right amount of curry for a fabulous flavor but not so hot that I couldn't eat it.  For my entree, the crab puffs and my soft drink it was $26.30 before the tip but I feel it was worth the price. My whole experience was great, I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Totally out of the way in an unassuming location, very good Thai food.  Came on the recommendation of a friend and we will be back when we can.  Ordered the tom yum with chicken, beef and basil, papaya salad with dried shrimp, and a pad thai.  They apparently only use Thai chilis so on their 1-5 scale, 2 has enough kick to make it worth your while.  The papaya salad was one of the best we've had.  Good fish sauce balanced with some heat and some sweetness.  It was crunchy, refreshing, and rivaled Lotus of Siam in Vegas.  The tom yum was also pretty good - served family style in a hotpot.  It had a lot of heat, but lacked some traditional sourness.  Might have been trying to accommodate Western tastes, so if you're looking for a particularly sour kick from your tom yum, this is not the place.  BUT, it is tasty here, with heavy notes of lemongrass and ginger.  The beef and basil stir fry was fine.  Nothing really special.  It was tasty, no complaints, nothing to rave about.  The pad thai here is good, with our only complaint being that it is a little tamarind heavy.  The noodles were just a tad overcooked, but we appreciated the general balance of their sauce (with again, just a little too much tamarind.)  But I appreciate that it was not the overly sweet mess that you get at most Thai places here - there was appropriate sourness and saltiness and heat all mixed in, with the sweetness playing second fiddle to the rest.  So an unexpected surprise in the Valley for Thai - and it just MIGHT be the best Thai in town.  Couple other places to go or retry before a final determination, but this place is legit.",

It wasn't too dry or overly saucy. We had it at spice level \"2\" which had a great kick to it. I love spicy food, and it gave me the sniffles from the spice. But it was really good and I would definitely eat here again. I gave them 4 stars bc service was good and I loved the pad Thai. Loved it. Just don't get the \"fresh roll\".",

We sat at the table waiting for him to come back but instead he was busy socializing with the girl behind the bar. We wanted a menu and not the buffet. I finally got tired of waiting and walked up and disrupted their conversation to ask for menu where the waiter then told me that we could order from the menu but he wasn't sure when the food might come out. Looking around I could see that other people had ordered from the menu. We gave in and ate the food at the buffet which was was lack luster at best. We will not return to this place, the service was terrible and the food at the buffet wasn't good. We will stick to Tom Yum, which I highly recommend.",

    "text": "I liked this place. The food was pretty good.  They get the championship belt for menus. Lots of clear pictures of all (most?) of the dishes.  If you are a noob, point and pick.  I had massaman beef #2 spicy. I had Thom Kha Gai (chicken) #2 spicy.  For dessert, I had mango sticky rice.   I was warned by the server/waitress that they tended to lean spicier than most places and she was absolutely correct. The #2 was between medium and hot at most places I've been to. (It was hotter than most mediums).   The massaman beef was great, it had a nice creamy curry. Large chunks of potatoes. Flap style beef. If they used the chunk style beef like they do at my favorite place, I would probably just eat at Reign of Thai a lot more. But they don't, so I will still go to my #1 spot. And Reign of Thai will be my #2.   The Thom Kha was delicious. also creamy. No BS tomatoes or other garbage. I like it simple.  Probably better here than at my #1.  The mango sticky rice was a fail. The rice tasted weird. The mango wasn't delicious.  The food was really good, so the dessert it is what it is, I'll order something different next time.   Folks mention sweetness in some other reviews. I could for sure see the sweetness, but dude it wasn't like kool-aid or anything. Just enough to note. Not really enough to be aggro about. Plus the food was so spicy that the sweetness was a welcome distraction.   The restaurant had a nice ambiance, and what looked to be like a bar set up.  I suppose it would be a nice hangout spot if you were into that sort of thing.   I'd recommend this place if you are around it. I have a feeling that it would be hard to find a better place in the vicinity. I still have my favorite, but Reign of Thai is a lot closer and in a nicer location, so I look forward to coming back and trying their different dishes.",

The flat noodles and thai basil chicken were probably my favorite. The flat noodles were cooked perfectly and had a slight sweetness to them. The thai basil chicken had a kick that was awesome and went really well with plain rice.   The Panang Curry was deliciously peanut buttery and the red curry was pretty spicy but had a great amount of flavor as well.   Overall, given the price tag combined with the amount of choices provided at Reign of Thai it's a no brainer to 5 star this place.  I will definitely be back and with a bigger appetite so I can try even more of their selection.",

How can I not get a medium, light spice in my pad thai??? When it is too spicy, it is literally almost inedible. I have another thai place I go to often and I will be going there from now on.

Though everything I tried was great, I was hoping for more variety. I ended up speaking to one of the very nice servers and expressed my mediocre feelings, and he let me order off the menu without charging me for the one plate I tried from the buffet. I went for the panang curry with beef, and it was delish!  Their Thai iced tea was decent, too. Will try it again during dinner time perhaps with a group so I can try more things.",

Unfortunately my second experience was even worse. This place is ran by young kids who are sweet, but very unorganized and careless. Shouting across tables in this tiny restaurant  to ask where the missing food is, and an obvious lack of professionalism, which makes their extra long wait time akward and uncomfortable. There is no music playing or anything to distract you, and sitting under bright fluorescent lights unfortunately just really adds to the akward vibe. Now the important part is, if the food was good I could care less about an akward vibe... But the food is not good. Or fresh :( My vegetables and meat tasted and looked OLD both times I visited. I really wanted to like this place and gave it a second try, hoping the second time would be better than the first. But both times I was beyond let down. If you want fresh quality ingredients,  a clean and nice vibe, this is not your spot.",

Our order was taken abruptly, our food came out fast & we were totally rushed.  Once our food was delivered, the server NEVER came back to see how our food was or to refill our waters & drinks.  During our meal, another set of customers were told the same thing as us as they got seated.  15 minutes before the restaurant closed, more customers came in & were told that they couldn't be seated because they closed in 15 minutes & they could only order take-out.  It's a shame that the service was not good considering there are so many competing restaurants & this establishment didn't value their customers.

    "text": "What a gem of a place! Family owned & operated. Take your favorite bottle of wine with you as it's a terrific BYOB spot.  We ordered one entree & the ingredients were so fresh & vibrant. The broccoli & broccoli rabe was perfectly cooked & crunchy.  The bean sprouts were large, white & burst with flavor in your mouth.  The chicken plump & perfectly cooked.  They err on the side of hot in their recipes as we had a level 2 & it was a fairly hot flavor. We have both traveled to Thailand & thought we were tough but I caution to get 2 or lower.   We enjoyed our bottle of Chardonnay while we ate.  We enjoyed it so much that we ordered the same recipe to go! As a lighter dessert we got the coconut ice cream with fried bananas. Perfectly delightfully light & sized to share.   The ambience is delicately decorated with Thai artifacts & impeccably clean.  The bathroom was super clean, painted a cool silver & smelled of orchids.  The door to the kitchen was open & I peeked inside & it was clean & everything was in its proper place. I was very happy to see that.     My only question was the audio ambience. There were not many tables occupied & it felt a little desolate that music would fill the vacant space. I remember hearing a little but then it was off.   The only other concern was the clarity of the menu.  My date did all the ordering so I did not browse the menu but he said it was really confusing to the new customer.    We stayed a few hours & by that time there were a few more tables occupied. I was happy to see that.   I highly highly recommend this place.  How we learned about it was on a recommendations from a stranger on a Piestwa  Peak mountain hike.  Thank you kind stranger.",

The meal had a perfect amount of spice - I picked 3 out of 5 on the spice gauge. Very tasty with large portions.",

It is a small comfortable place with good food, so how can you go wrong.  We ordered from the menu for dessert (coconut ice cream with fried bananas) and it was huge and delicious.  Would definitely go back.",
