The mixed green starter salad could easily be a full meal, along with any of the vegetable side dishes.  The beer selection is mediocre, with only two local brews on tap.    All you people giving this place a bad review ... get over yourselves.  It is in a shopping plaza by the convention center in a part of the country where cattle should not be raised.  What do you expect?",

    "text": "Although we had passed by many times before we attempted to dine at 1103 for the first time last night.  I say attempted because the hour long experience ended with neither my husband or I eating more than four bites of food each.  First, our server was really slow and seemed to vanish into thin air quite often.  So much so that I frequently had to flag down another sever, Roger, to find our server.  I will say that Roger was the only positive about our experience because he was very nice and professional.  We asked our server how the calamari was to which she replied that the sauce that comes with it was very good because it combined a sweet and spicy taste so we ordered the calamari to start.  However, our server neglected to tell us that calamari is drowned in the sauce rather than the sauce coming on the side to dip which would have been useful information.  In addition the calamari came out fairly cold but we couldn't find our server to tell her that so I had to approach the Host to have him take the calamari back and order another starter.  Our server also didn't know about the entrees on the menu which is frustrating.  My husband ordered the Pasta Rustica which had penne pasta, red sauce and chicken.  I wanted the Seafood pasta and asked the server what vegetables came in the dish because the menu simply stated assorted vegetables and there are certain veggies I don't like.  She stated there was tomato and asparagus which I like both so I ordered that.  Our entrees arrived just a few moments after the Host had taken the calamari back so we cancelled the order for the second starter.  When I looked at my entree I noted that there where muscles in the shell, shrimp, lobster, tomato and asparagus which I expected however there was also quite a lot of julienned vegetables that the server apparently did not know were also included in the \"assorted vegetables\".  This assortment really included zucchini, yellow squash, red onion, bell peppers, etc.  Also, the server neglected to bring another dish to put the muscle shells on so I once again had to flag down Roger to find her.  Then I noticed that three of the shrimp on my plate didn't have the tail shell on them but one did which was strange.  My husband's entree was inedible as the chicken was completely overcooked to the point where it was hard on the ends and he had to spit it out. I tried to pick around the bell peppers and onions in my dish but due to the amount of thinly julienned vegetables I couldn't and I hate those two items in my food.  At this point we asked to see the manager.  The manager was interesting to say the least because as we were explaining the issues with the service and the food he just stood there essentially blank faced and then proceeded to tell us that well yes the shrimp was supposed to come with the tail shell on it.  Huh?? After all that this is what he takes out of it, really?!  Well he took our entrees and then, wait for it, yes he brought back a bill that had the food we didn't eat removed however it of course still included my drink.  One would think that after this type of experience the management could comp a drink!  Oh, and to make it all better as he is handing us the bill the manager goes on to explain that he understands how important it is that servers know the menu because they have had a few issues with people having allergies to certain things in the food \"but that was really the customers fault more than the servers.\"    The only reason I am giving this place even one star is because apparently they have a good bartender as my chocolate martini was pretty good.  I know we will never go back and as far as I'm concerned this place needs a serious Hell's Kitchen intervention!",

I had a sandwich and tried some of the salmon salad.  Both were very good portions, well prepared, and flavorful.  Service was friendly and attentive.  In general, it's not a place I would immediately go to again if I were at the Arizona Center since I want to try the other restaurants they have first, but it's a solid choice if you're wanting something familiar.",

They were chunky and revolting - mine went back.  I ordered the turkey burger and my companion had the salmon sandwich.  After a wait that was infinitely too long we received our rather sad looking meals.  My turkey burger came completely dry and solo on a squished and soggy bun.  It was obviously a frozen patty and not from a reputable brand either.  My fries were even worse as they were both undercooked and greasy at the same time.  My companion's salmon sandwich was overcooked and served with rancid looking lettuce.  Not a good way to earn our favor.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs.",

    "text": "I went here today for an early dinner, after reading that 1130 had a good selection of gluten-free food. I ordered the large filet, french fries, and grilled asparagus. My partner ordered the rib-eye, garlic smashed potatoes, and grilled asparagus. We also ordered tableside guacamole to start.  The service was excellent every step of the way, but the food was underwhelming. The guacamole was $12 for only 1.5 small avocados not very ripe. I could see that the water had a hard time mashing them and in the end he left many hard chunks. The guacamole was enough to exactly fill a cocktail glass. I expect more and better guacamole for $12.  We ordered our steaks medium. They were actually cooked very unevenly: there was a tough outer crust, and the inside varied between medium well and almost well-done. It's really a shame to cook a filet almost well-done! Half of my french fries were good, but half of them were squished and greasy.   Over all I found 1130 to be overpriced and unimpressive food. I wish I had just gone to Monti's.",

I was excited to find out that the brunch menu lasts until 3 PM which included their $2 mimosas. The mimosas are not made with the best champagne in the world but hey they'll do for a casual lunch.  It was pretty empty inside so we decided to dine on the patio so we could also people watch. I ordered the salmon burger with a side salad which was pretty good. The size of the salmon was huge and the sauce that was on the bun was delish. The salad was just meh, again the dressing was good but the lettuce was not fresh.  Our server was a bit forgetful as well he mixed up a couple of things on our orders but at least he offered to split the check for us. Overall this was an average dining experience.",

    "text": "Although I did not eat at 1130, I visited the bar a couple of times. There are 2 small TVs facing the bar, and 2 giant screens behind the bar.  I found it a little odd that one of the screens was backwards.  Turns out it's meant for patrons on the other side of the restaurant.  Not a big deal - but the owner may want to find another way to allow those in the restaurant to watch TV.  Both bartenders that I met (Dale and Cassie...and Dale was cute too!) were very personable and made me feel comfortable sitting at the bar by myself.  Drinks were reasonably priced (at least for what I'm used to in the DC area)...$2 and some change for Bud Light on tap.  My only negative comment about this restaurant is that it closes at 10pm on most nights!  I went because it was located very close to my hotel and the staff were friendly, but 10pm is so early, especially on a weekend night!  Suggestion to the owner - stay open later and give Hooters some competition!  Overall, this is a decent place to hangout and have a few drinks.  They also have weekday happy hour specials like ladies night on Thursday.",

When the weather is nice, there is nothing better than their patio on a weekend afternoon. Pull up a chair and order the first round of $2 Mimosas. They can get a little pulpy for my taste, so sometimes I'll ask for pulp-free OJ. But come on...$2 Mimosas.  I've had food at 1130 and its never been anything to write home about (much less a review), so I won't. They have a pretty good happy hour and the bar area often gets quite busy (there seem to be a lot of meetings held there, like social clubs and post-convention types). I've always had good service and they at least pretend to remember me, which I appreciate.  I know what I'll remember...$2 Mimosas!",

    "text": "So if you're in downtown there's something you MUST eat. They're called Lobster Lettuce Cups. I had the good fortune to sample at FED after TEDx (a reception where you get to mingle with speakers). Culinary delights abounded from our downtown friends and were paired with beer.   The lettuce was like butter, perhaps a boston or bibb varietal, slightly sweet and soft. Inside was a combination my palate is screaming for right now: lobster meat, avocado, friend wontons*, a vege slaw and sprouts. All sprinkled in with sesame ginger sauce.  Why the asterisk? A rewarding crunch greets you with every bite. Fried wontons *really* work here. It is impossible to describe how wonderful this combination of ingredients is. A generous fistful of food, four lettuce cups during lunch and dinner, three during happy hour, you can't go wrong. This is decidedly a shareable starter and well worth any price point. (On the To Go menu I picked up for dinner they are $14.)  Oh! If you're a beer drinker try the New Belgium Snapshot with it.   Happy Hour is 4-7pm seven days a week! If the folks at FED after TEDx are any indication of customer service you will be treated quite nicely.   Sunday brunch is 10am to 3pm with two dollar mimosas :) Dangerously enough they offer \"build your own mimosa\" for $10, complete with a bottle of champagne and an OJ carafe.  And that sounds perfect.  Except that today is Monday. & There was flood level rain today.  *sigh*",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were in town for a four day event at the Phoenix convention center, and this is now my absolute favorite restaurant of its kind (American cuisine, steaks, etc.). I have never before in my life had such amazing service and stunningly delicious food at the same place. My only regret is living so far from Phoenix that we can't enjoy it on a more regular basis! We both loved this restaurant so much that we are actually looking forward to our yearly trip into Phoenix even more so with the prospect of dining here again. It also couldn't possibly be in a better location for us accessibility wise, so that was a major perk too, but certainly far from the greatest feature this restaurant has to offer.  I will also add that despite this being a very busy time of the year for that area of downtown Phoenix, there were never any seating issues or waiting involved. We were never rushed in the slightest, nor made late for anything else due to speed issues. That is beyond appreciated. 1130 was a True refuge from the hectic convention, and allowed us a moment of quiet respite to breathe and eat and refuel before getting back to the grind. Actually, I think I looked forward to meal times almost more than anything else because of this.   We did both eat there for nearly every meal throughout the four day stay, and there was nothing that ever failed to meet the highest standard. The staff (and especially management) treat their customers royally. They seem to genuinely value all customers and have been so kind every single day (even more than once a day!) that we were there. They made us feel welcome and at home, by being so friendly and personable, and honestly going above and beyond. Some establishments in the area tend not to be very nice or open to people who come in for specific themed events, but not this place! Even though it was a nice restaurant with a classy higher-end feel, they did not mind that my boyfriend and I were sometimes a little disheveled from the heat outside, the event, or dressed interestingly.   If they were open for breakfast, we would have probably gotten up a bit earlier to have breakfast there too. I actually did have their brunch on Sunday, and the lobster omelet was absolutely spectacular. Fragrant chunks of lobster topped a fluffy (and perfectly sized) veggie-stuffed omelet, and the whole thing was coated in a divine creamy lobster sauce. The menu at 1130 is not ridiculously extensive-- but this is a good thing, because it means they do what they do very well. And there was enough variety that my boyfriend and I did not eat the same entree twice (though we would have, if we had the time). The coffee we both enjoyed more than once, and it was served in the cutest little french press pitcher along with a side of cream (and sweetener if desired). It was also some of the best coffee I've had, outside of perhaps small specialty cafes. However, I almost never find amazing quality coffee in a food/dinner focused establishment, so this was a real gem. Their chilled and filtered water was also very crisp, cold, and they left a large glass bottle of it at the table each time so we could keep ourselves topped up when need be.  Something my boyfriend and I *really* appreciated was that compared to other restaurants in the area, this restaurant had healthier eating options, and could accommodate food restrictions very well.  As far as the food itself goes, every item was stellar, with a range in meal sizes depending on how hungry you might be. But there were some favorites. Most notably, a major favorite of ours was the grilled asparagus. They were delicate, tender, well seasoned, perfectly charred, and had a faint smoky aroma which was delicious! Actually, all of their fresh produce was of very high quality. The cut fruit may have been the highest quality cut fruit I've been served anywhere, and they even made fruits I was not a fan of become new favorites. I did not know melon could be so refreshing and tasty! Their 'Chef's Vegetables\", which ended up being broccoli in this case, was a bit plain (I probably would have preferred it with some seasoning or a light sauce) but clearly very fresh and crisp.   Their meats were tasty and juicy every time-- I had a \"Navajo style\" 16 oz Rib Eye with sauteed mushrooms in a brown mole sauce-and it was heaven. To die for! It was my second favorite protein that I have eaten here. The favorite, which takes the spot as \"best fish I have ever had\", was the citrus tilapia. Perfectly flaky and crisped tilapia along with shrimps coated in the most succulent orange glaze sauce (with bits of sauteed orange too, I loved those!) atop the best seasoned Basmati \"rice pilaf\". I ate every bite and was stuffed... especially because they open by bringing out a plate of fresh complimentary toasted bread smothered with honey butter and melty cheese.  The desserts are well portioned and noteworthy too, especially the mango key lime pie. Tart, sweet, and a great finish.",

Just  seemed like cheap food, and I would have expected higher quality for $20.  To be fair, the waiter said the place was known for their steaks, and no one in our party ordered steak, so maybe the steaks are better.",

I truly cannot say enough about the service and food. Very moderately priced. $35/ribeye with 2 sides. Pleezzz! My only negative comment is they don't come up in the \"steak\" or \"steakhouse\" Yelp search so I had to sleuth some menus to find this wonderful establishment.

    "text": "Party of 4 - went on recommendation   Service was A+... Great guy. Very personable and attentive.  The place was slow and he used the down time to focus on us.  Appetizers A+... Lobster cups were like lettuce wraps with lobster meat, fresh lettuce, nice fixins and seasonong. Highly recommended.  Table side quacamole was perfect and huge portion. With a nice mix of premium cocktails, our dinner was off to a nice start  Atmosphere B-... back of room had folding tables partially broken down near a cluttered area that appeared to be after some live music set up but never disassembled. Our table had a spot light from the ceiling on it that was so invasive we had to move the table (with the waiters help) out of the direct light rays. There was no sense of organization in the room with table set up and the room was in such a disorganized manner that it took away from being a comfortable setting. Cleanliness was fine.  Entrees C+... Two guests got filets and they were adequate.  My Ribeye was ordered medium rare and it was a disaster! No pink at all, pounded thin, so tough that I could not eat it. $30+ and I would not have fed it to my dog. I barely took 2 bites and they didn't remove it from the bill. If they got their act together with the steaks it would have been fine.  Management F  Did not remove my terrible steak from the bill! Greedy! Worst scenario... we were the last party and ordered coffee and cocktails and the manager turned on the lights full blast to make us leave. This is what you do in a college bar at 2am, not with two couples that just spent a few hundred dollars each. Ridiculous   This place is one of the only choices by the Convention center hotels. I do not recommend it due to how it is run and the value for the money is low. The server made up for a lot.",

However happy hour and drinks turned into dinner so I ended up trying it and i was pleasantly surprised.  Food - 3.5/5 Everyone I was with seemed to enjoy their meals ranging from salad, burgers, steak to fish. I enjoyed the Smothered Chicken. The only complaint is that the waitress brought out what looked delicious their \"speciality\" cheese covered bread. The bread was a little chewy / soggy i had a couple bites before pushing it aside.  Service - 4/5 Our waitress braved a couple moves on the patio and our transition to the dining room, she was nice and conversational.  Atmosphere - 3/5 Nice atmosphere, wasn't crowded, in fact it was almost empty.  Price - 2/5 Reasonable but nothing to jump up and down about.  Overall - Worth a try, I'd go back for the Smothered Chicken again.",

The fresh fruit was barely a quarter of an apple where they did not remove the core and a bunch of grapes. 4 very small pieces of cheese. I have seen children chefs on TV shows that surpassed this platter. This establishment had a lot of nerve charging such a ridiculous price for a sorry crappy display of food. Never returning.

I was with a group of friends and we ordered basically everything off of the happy hour menu.   Word of caution their wings are SPICYYYYY so for those who do not enjoy a fire in your mouth avoid at all costs.   HOWEVER, even if you do not like calamari I advise EVERYONE to try theirs. For four dollars you will not be disappointed. It seemed they flash fried it and then tossed it in a sweet Thai sauce that had me eating my friends food off of her plate and making me ignore my own wings!   I really loved their cheesecake because it was not overly rich and had a thicker Graham cracker crust!  All in all I will definitely be returning and would highly recommend someone else going!

Once we did get our food, we were truly disappointed. Two of us in our group ordered benedicts and none were cooked correctly. The \"poached\" eggs were all over-cooked. I had the florentine Benedict and there was nothing about it that would make me return. The sauce was mediocre, the spinach and artichokes were minimal and the potatoes were extra crunchy. One person in our group ordered the salmon sandwich and the comment was that it tasted good at first but only because there was sauce. Once the sauce ran it, the taste was bland. We had to have a cheeseburger comped because it was too dry to eat. The kids chicken fingers were not great but edible. Even the desserts didn't impress me, and it doesn't take much to impress me in the dessert department. It's hard to see how this place stays open, but it makes sense why it was so empty when we arrived. The location is great and the place is beautiful, but the food just didn't cut it for me.

However, the staff was still patient with us even though we ordered late and took our time. There is a 10% discount off your bill if you check in. The manager didn't seem too happy when I told him about the discount, but he did give the entire party the discount, which was cool. For dinner I ordered a sirloin steak, but I've had better.

All of our plates were cold when we visited last. The service is pretty dull. The server barely cracks a smile and always looks bored. Interesting that I've had the same server all 3 times I have visited. I work across the street so this place is convenient and honestly, there's not much else better to choose from in Arizona Center. I hope the new remodel brings some better eateries. The table side guac here is decent. They put tequila in it. That's pretty much a gimmick as it doesn't add any really remarkable notes to the guac but you know it's there. At least it's not overpowering. They can improve the guac probably if they roast the tomatoes to give it another dimension. Otherwise, it's your standard table side guac. I ordered my proteins medium rare. What I got was well done. Not good.",

    "text": "I came here for lunch during a conference at a convention and had a horrible experience. I would imagine that restaurants in the area would be prepared and staffed to provide service for big groups, especially with the convention center so close by. I was wrong.  1. Our group of 15 made reservations in advance. We got seated outside with four tables put together and was provided with only 12 seats. We had to squeeze in 3 seats on our own. Our table was so close to the main door that we (and the servers) couldn't walk through the doors. There was ample space away from the doors and was not sure why we were seated in such an inconvenient and uncomfortable area.   2. The girls' restroom door handle is almost falling off the door. Soon enough, someone will be stuck in the bathroom because the door needs to be pulled.    3. Our orders were taken fairly quickly. However, it seemed like we have been waiting for our food for an usually long amount of time. I looked at the time, and sure enough, we've been waiting for over 40 minutes. Our server comes by and let's us know that some of our plates of food went to another table. We look around and the restaurant is packed with customers with NO FOOD. We even saw some people walk up and leave the restaurant.   4. A free dessert  per table for checking in! I was so excited! I made sure to ask our server about this great offer. I asked him if we can use more than one check-in offer. (Don't forget we had 15 people with 4 tables pushed together) He told me that it would still be one dessert for our large group. He also told me to save the offer for another visit when I come back with just one other person. One per table is misleading, so please change the verbage of your check-in offer. It's misleading! I told him that I was not from the area so I would not be back. Even if I lived close by, I would not be back to visit anyway.    Our food was not as good, but because of the disappointing service I did not enjoy my meal.",

Twice in the last couple of weeks they screwed up my order and when I pointed it out \" I can get you a free dessert\" I can only imagine why they want to go rid of their desserts. I'd much prefer a reduction on my bill for poor quality.

A friend ordered the Pozole and it looked excellent with large, beautiful chunks of stewed pork in a rich broth.  He loved it.  Another had the very expensive rib eye with the Phoenix dressing. He was very unhappy with the very fatty and chewy cut that he received.  Don't get any tomato based pasta here! it's supposed to be fresh but it's over cooked and mushy and overly soaked in a sauce that tastes of bland, unseasoned tomato paste and nothing else.   This is not a place for pasta. my mistake.   Conclusion? I will return for lunch but I'll stick to the basics.",

The manager did not even have enough common sense to realize that she should give the lady new utensils given that the ones on the plate touched what ever was in the salad.  The food was good, but the orders were screwed up.  Instead of taking the plates back, the manager had us use our hands to transfer the steaks from one plate to the next.  Still the order was actually wrong.   Fortunately, the steak was excellent, but I can find better steak elsewhere and get much better service at Outback.",

My husband and myself would always come here before we go to the movies. The food basic really the lobster lettuce wraps pretty good. Today I different I came after work a quick bite before my spin class.i walk in to a basically enpty building 11 people total. Im still sitting here as I write this. Its happy hour I order the lobster wraps with the bartender. He appears to be unhappy with his job. He was very rude and never even told me his name. The food ok lobster was a little watery but over all ok for 7.50 on happy hour. I finish eating and asked if I could get a order to go he tells me no. I was like no what do you mean no he tells he happy hour food cannot be to go. Little did he know I was asking for the order to go so my team could try it. We would have order 300 orders if he placed my order. Restaurant owners need to realize everyone may not compromise to infamous happy hour issue they may just want to take a order to go to spread the word about the restaurant.  I will not comw back to this place again.",

SAMs cafe was good, nothing too exciting but the service was excellent. I finally decided to go back to 1130 last month and they have made noticeable changes with their coupon policy. Now everyone understands the coupon and Josh (I believe was our AMAZING waiter) and explained you can use the coupon for alcohol AND food. He was very sure and knowledgeable of the coupon policy, so they seem to have addressed the issue with the entire staff since our last visit which is what a business is suppose to do to improve and draw customers back. They addressed the problem and fixed it, i was surprised.  We ordered the steak salad, calamari, salmon burger, Reuben dip and the flavored ice teas. Everything was cooked well and my parents loved the food and will definitely be back. I am very pleased the 1130 addressed the confusion with the coupons and very grateful for the email from Amber apologizing and offering certificates to make up for our last visit. She went above and beyond to keep a customer, I am very impressed and excited to be able to enjoy the 1130 again.",

The mediterranean pasta dish was to die for.  I skipped the mussels and was given extra shrimp and lobster. What a treat.  The strawberry mojito was outstanding, the best I've tasted so far.  The food and service were amazing that we decided to come back the next day.  I had the salmon ciabatta sandwich and my friend had the steak salad, both very delish!  I would highly recommend this place. So much for the food, let me tell you about our server Dee, a young lady from Brooklyn.  She was the most personable woman I've ever met from Brooklyn.  What a joy, after a hard days work to relax in a place like this and have Dee at your service.  A truly enjoyable experience!",

While the place was pretty empty at 6pm, it picked up as the night went on. The food is a bit pr icy for the location in the AZ Center, but the service was excellent and the food was solid. I cant say that anything special stood out about the place, it just seems to work well. Wait staff was attentive, but did not hassle us too often, as can often be the case. The food was fresh and well prepared. I would recommend it if you are looking for something nice, but modest in atmosphere.",

    "text": "I think 1130 positions itself as the fine dining alternative in Arizona Center.  Unfortunately, it's basically one step up from sports bar cuisine.  Now, the food wasn't bad, it just wasn't what I was expecting.  The calamari appetizer (I don't know why I always want to order seafood in the desert - glutton for punishment, I guess) was ok, probably because it was deep fried and smothered with sweet chili sauce and served over fried tortilla strips.  But when you combine that much fried food with a sugary sauce, how can you go wrong?  My BBQ chicken salad entree was fine.  Greens, with a grilled chicken breast with a helathy dollop of BBQ sauce.  Again, fine, but nothing special.  For some reason I was expecting more, but 1130 isn't breaking any new culinary ground.  Fine for what it was.  I guess I shouldn't have expected more from a place that screams \"$2 MIMOSAS!!!\" on the sign out front.",

    "text": "A friend and I stopped in on Saturday night . Until tonight I had only ever sat at the bar for their mojitos and the occasional appetizer during happy hour. I really didn't know what to expect from the food and I was curious to find out. We were greeted and seated quickly in their large dining area. I found it strange that they had a football game being projected on the wall behind us. I can understand this in the bar area but in the main dining area?  [This seems to be the \"thing\" in AZ Center...drawing people in with the TVs. The folks at Brick told me a story this week about a night where they lost like 15 customers because their TVs were not working and showing the game.]  ANYWAY!  We chatted and studied the menu. Our server was very attentive and patient as it took us a bit to order our drinks and then our meal. I ordered the shrimp fettuccine alfredo and my friend had the Mediterranean pasta. We both decided on the Cesar salad to start the meal. The dressing on the Cesar was light enough but even at that it was a bit heavy on what seemed to be Dijon. Now I am a fan of mustard but this was a bit much for a Cesar, it didn't make it inedible though.  The servings of our main course were substantial. The shrimp were large and well prepared. While not THE BEST I ever had where Alfredo sauce is concerned, I was very pleased with the quality of the dish as a whole. My friend was quite pleased with his dish and finished every bite. I found the cheese bread served with the dish to be \"different\" it was sweet like a honey butter with a mixed yellow and white cheese melted on top (colby jack calico cheese?). Again I found it to be \"off\" but not inedible. I would have been more pleased with a more simple toasted garlic bread. I did bring home more than half of my meal as leftovers for later.  While I will say that I could give this place 4 stars it would be mostly due to the proximity to where I live. The food and ambiance have the potential to be 4-5 stars, there is still room for improvement. I still have to say it is as good or better than Kincaid's. [A fellow downtown restaurant maybe going for a slightly more formal presentation than 1130, they are pretty similar in style.]  The projection TV in the dining area, tends to cheapen the experience and doesn't match. Keep the TVs in the bar or if the customers are demanding the TVs then expand the bar ...  *sigh*",

We started off with the chili calamari, and it was incredible. Then I had a wedge salad and chicken picatta. I had to pack it up to bring home because there was no way I could eat that much. Prices were reasonable, especially considering the portions. My mojito was ok, Merc Bar still has better ones. If I did have a complaint, it would be to expand the wines by the glass list. Loved the football games on the glass so everyone could see in the bar and the restaurant dining room! I would go back.",

My fries were cold as well. Again, why????? No one was there but us.  I am also not impressed with a place where you have to ask a waiter for everything all the time. A waiter should kind of see you need a water refill. I should have read the reviews before I suggested this place.I am glad my friends were ok with it.

    "text": "After Amber, a manager/owner I am assuming, sent me a couple dining certificates to 1130, I decided to come back during earth hour since they have such a great patio.  What a turnaround I experienced this time.  We were seated immediately but we waited a good 5-10 minutes before someone came over to us.  Our server, J, came over and sincerely apologized.  He took our drink order and immediately came back with our sodas.  We had decided what to eat and I ordered the Sirloin in Cancun style (spice rubbed with a creamy wine sauce with peppers, corn, and shrimp) and the husband ordered a burger.  J recommended a particular burger that was only on the lunch menu, stating it was way better, and hooked the husband up with that one instead.  My steak was very good, although slightly undercooked in the very middle only.  It only makes sense because it was so thick and everywhere else was perfect.  The asparagus that came with it was very well grilled and seasoned and was a perfect accompaniment to the slab of meat.  During our meal, J kept our sodas constantly full.  When we finished he offered us dessert and we politely declined.  We usually never order desserts at restaurants because too often they aren't prepared in house.  This was not good enough for J, and he wasn't taking no for an answer.  After a little prodding, a wink, and an \"I'm feeling extra nice today\" he hooked us up with a free cheesecake, which we were delighted to learn was made in house.  We devoured that, it was very good.  He came back and asked us about it and the husband mentioned the crust being a little dry.  I told him some more butter will solve that and he said he would pass it on to the kitchen.  Experience means a lot to me when it comes to rating a restaurant.  If I have a great server, it will improve my feelings for a restaurant.  J was absolutely amazing.  He was friendly, attentive, and really nice to chat with.  What a wonderful evening we had dining by candlelight on the patio.  Even though I had 20 dollars off my meal thanks to the concern of the management I would give 1130 the 4 stars had I paid for my whole meal.  I will probably be back again, but I will definitely request J, and you should too.",

The weather was really nice so I was glad that Heather chose a patio table. Our waiter was a kid. I mean, I know I'm getting older, but he was a clumsy kid who fumbled through the drink specials and needed some sharpness. With such a cool sleek spot, you would probably want a more professional waiter. Just my opinion. We decided on the lobster lettuce cups that were rather large and surprisingly full of lobster meat! I really liked the appetizer, I was wishing for more acid but it was still refreshing and tasty. We took our waiter's suggestion and ordered the calamari. What a surprise! I really liked the calamari! It came drizzled with a sweet chili sauce and had pepperocinis tossed into the mix.It was great! I loved how the sweetness of the calamari meat, and the chili sauce played well with the tanginess of the pepperocinis! I had some kind of peach martini that was WAY too sweet for my taste, but I guess for a girly drink it was ok.  I hope that next time we'll have more time to linger and maybe even have dinner. I look forward to trying their other offerings.",

We had the calamari which was deep fried with a heavy batter and a heavy sweet and sour syrup. The steak salad was relatively straight forward, cold sliced steak, a spring lettuce mix, blue cheese and pecans. A great combination but it was bland and uninspiring. The food was average but the service was fantastic, the wait staff overflowed with refills and prompt service",

You know it is taking a long time to get your food when you start joking \"well, our waitress must be at the ocean, getting on her scuba gear to pick out the lobster....\" It was Mother's Day, I did my best to be patient. Any way the food was meh...although I liked their lobster sauce, i thought the lobster was chewy. So we finish our meal and we get the check and only one meal had been credited for the Mother's free meal, but there were 2 Mother's at the table? So I tried to get a straight answer from the waitress....but she was trying to tell us each Mother only gets half their meal for free, huh? That's not what you advertised...lame. But who wants to argue on Mother's day? So I let it go and enjoyed the rest of my Mother's day. Except my son got very sick after and felt weak this morning. So sorry 1130, we won't be back.",

    "text": "Even the waiter commented on \"the dinner from hell\". This is a restaurant pretending to be a Steakhouse and not even coming close; it is most defiantly not! In this location it probably survives as a business soup and salad quick lunch spot, but I would avoid making plans for dinner. I could elaborate in several paragraphs on how the inexperienced waitstaff, clueless manager and struggling kitchen destroyed our dinner of 2 hours and 45 minutes (hint: we didn't stay that long because of the enjoyable experience) but this restaurant isn't worth the time. In my course of dining out in all types and levels of restaurants and entertaining clients in over 35 years of business this restaurant has to be in my top ten worst list. As for the food I will confirm that the Lobster Lettuce Wraps we're very good, came out on time and were served well but that's where it all ended. The second time our 6oz filets came out they were substituted with processed, prepackaged, pre seared replacements. The only reason I am giving it one star is because at some point during this meal it became humorously bad entertainment. It would be hard to eclipse this stunning bad restaurant meal. Please don't eat here.",

Was cooked fairly good and has a nice flavor.    To drink- Pinot Noir.  Didn't get the brand. It was alright.   If you're looking for a decent meal in the AZ Center area (which is all currently under construction but easy to get to) then you won't go wrong here.  I'd go back!",

You won't be served a lot of attitude, and both the staff and regulars alike keep the atmosphere light.  Some of my menu favs include: the lobster lettuce cups, calamari, mussels, steak salad, seafood pasta and pretty much any of their steak preparations (I tend to lean towards the black and blue, which, if you like blue cheese like me, is divine). Their steaks are well portioned and VERY well priced for the quality (I'd put them on the same level as some of the pricier steak joints in town - many of which I've also dined at).  Their wine list and draft beers have something for everybody and their bartenders do a great job of mixing both their signature cocktails and classics (I've been known to enjoy a Manhattan on occasion).  Hopefully with the renovations coming to the Arizona Center more people will be inclined to check this place out!",

The fried won ton strips seemed out of place.. The cheese bread that came with both our meals also seemed out of place and a bit off. You know that sour cheese vibe, not funky good cheese but the other. Our waiter was friendly, still service wasn't fantastic.

I wonder if he is still working there??? I should have given him my number . . . Ha! But that's beside the point . . . .   What I got to say about this spot is phewy! Let's start with the wine! I don't even remember what I got now, but I do remember the serving was what they usually give you during the tasting of the wine before the actual serving (should you choose it) is given. I looked at that glass and then at my Jacob like he was smoking crack! He responded with 'I am just doing my job!' . . . okay .. . .   Then I ordered a fillet mignon with asparagus! My guest order pretty much the same meal. But his was satisfactory! I order my steak medium well! The first attempt came out looking like a burnt piece of sirloin! No joke! So I sent it back of course, and requested the same order be prepared to my initial request! Well Yolks, no joke, the 2nd attempt, was a little better, more done then well, but the cut still look like sirloin. So needless to say, I forewent dinner! I did  get an extra serving of wine on top of my initial serving, for free, which then brought my serving of wine almost half way to the glass which would be consider a normal serving anywheres else. Oh! And I forgot to mention that that 'taste' of wine cost me $10 bucks! For real! . . .   So, if you are planning to go to the 1130, I would recommend possible going around 1130 so you can catch their lunch specials which seem to be reasonably priced. And since usually lunch is easily prepared, you may have better luck in ensuring your meal comes out like you expect it to! ....As far as dinner, uuuhhhh, NO!   If I had to rate this, it would get a 'ghetto fabulous'! All dressed up and driving a hoochie! This means that the prices are way too high for the quality of food you are getting!",

I was seated quickly with a nice view out the windows and the server didn't waste time taking my order.  Happy Hour went until 11:30 a.m. and included a $2 mimosa or bloody mary. Both were quite good. It was still breakfast-ish time so I had the walnut-banana pancakes.... and inhaled them. I drink lots and lots of water, and a full glass of water when I'm out is my barometer for a great tip or a good tip. The server brought out a big chilled glass bottle of water, so I was a happy camper.   It's too bad the restaurant is in the Arizona Center.  I don't particularly like the Arizona Center. It's some wannabe suburban strip mall, where all the stores and restaurant face away from the street. But If I was back at the Arizona Center, I would go to 1130 again.",

He offered us flavored tea but failed to mention that they came in bottles, which neither of us wanted. I got a side caesar and the seafood pasta. My friend got the french dip. The food was okay. The salad was absolutely huge for a side salad and I quickly regretted ordering it. My friend's fries were good but the french dip's meat was extremely salty and hard to eat. My pasta, like the rest of the food, was just mediocre. In the end, we probably won't go back here because it is the least pleasing restaurant in the center.",

First, we were the only people in the restaurant when we arrived so the fact that it took 45 minutes to get our food was surprising but we weren't in a hurry and were enjoying our drinks. But, our food was cold. I got the burrito and the cheese inside wasn't even melted, and the eggs were cool. The other people I was with got eggs Benedict and the eggs were cold-- not just room temperature, but like they were out of the refrigerator cold. It was weird. We figured the time it took to get our food was a result of the cooking process...We told them the food was cold and the manager (I think) said that maybe the heat light wasn't on but that they just put the order up... They took our food back and, I'm assuming, microwaved it and returned it to us pretty quickly. All the employees acted irritated and were not apologetic until the manager came and said she would pay for our meals and we would just need to pay for our drinks, which was appreciated. Even after the food was heated, it was sub par with little flavor. The fruit was not ripe. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience. I'm glad they took responsibility by taking care of our food and I may be willing to try them again.",

    "text": "I am torn as to how to rate 11:30.  I have had many, many a lovely morning/early afternoon here drinking their FABULOUS $2 bloody mary's and mimosa's.  Sitting on the patio drinking for practically free is NEVER a bad way to spend a Saturday morning.    HOWEVER, if you want to eat, there are a million other, better places to go.  Local Breeze, Hula, Switch, Carly's.  All have amazing Bloodies and Mimosas with great food to boot.  I went in with a group of friends for brunch one morning.  The place was empty like a Filibertos after a raid.  Still, we waited incredibly  long times for our drinks, the order, and finally, our food.  The drinks were fine, but offers for refills did not come at all.  When the food arrived, it was...um, well, inedible.   After waiting 30 minutes for it, we were looking forward to some yummy goodness.  We had, after all, ordered practically one of each of the brunch specials.    None of it was good.  The conversation with the server went like this:  SERVER:  So, how is everything?  GROUP:  Ummm.  (Silence)  SERVER:  I will take your silence as a good thing.  ME:  Don't.  SERVER:  Excuse me?  ME:  This is bad.  I am sorry, I don't usually complain, but this is, collectively, the worst breakfast I've ever been served.  SERVER:  Excuse me. (He leaves)  This is why the place is getting three stars and not none.  The manager came back just a few minutes later, chatted with us for a moment, apologized, and comped all five meals.  Completely comped them.  (This is not a good strategy for getting free stuff, incidentally.  The food really was awful.  Free awful food is still free, but more importantly, its still awful.)  Of course we left our server a huge tip, and got the hell outta dodge.    I will still say that the drinks are great, the Bloodies are some of the best around and who can beat $2, and the pancakes are good.  Reaaallllly good.   But the rest...mmm, not so much.",

We waited 20 minutes to be greeted at our table. Another 35 for our salads. And our waiter was so arrogant and distant that my manager actually left him a note saying \"it appeared we were bothering him by being there\" Anyway, the waiters and waitresses seemed to be more concerned with each other in the back corner of the restaurant, but unfortunately in plain sight of patrons, than they were with their customers.",

    "text": "1130 was the 3rd stop on our dine around tour today and it was pretty average. The three of us had a taste of everything they offered, but I had the pesto chicken pasta and their $2 mimosa (normal brunch menu offering). The pesto was a good portion, but it seemed like they thinned the pesto out to make it last, so it didn't have as much flavor as it could have. And the chicken was a little lackluster. I didn't taste the lobster cup since I'm not a seafood fan, but Jon seemed to enjoy it. The key lime pie was pretty standard, and the mimosas were heavy on the champagne, which I guess can be good but threw off the balance of the drink. Our server Kai was great, and I think on a Fri or Sat night this would be a good place to grab some drinks or dinner. I wouldn't rule it out, but nothing really stood out about it, besides the service.",

It was not my first choice and I cant say that I would recommend this restaurant to any of my friends. I ordered the \"french dip\" sandwich. The bread was dry and the \"jus\" was so salty I could not finish the sandwich. Also, it was extremely warm in the Restaurant which on a hot Phoenix day is what we were trying to escape. All in all, it seems this Restaurant serves its purpose, which is a single serving dining experience for \"out-of-towners\".",

Most ordered salad's which were huge everyone liked.  As a vegetarian, I found that the menu didn't have many options for me.  I could have order a good wrap or sandwich minus the meat, but $15 for the lobster wrap minus the lobster is a little steep.  All the main dish salads had meat too, which I was disappointed to see.    Service was pretty good , although the place wasn't busy.  They did bring out a yummy strawberry shortcake thing for a coworkers birthday, with plenty to share for 7 of us.  All in all, I probably won't be back because of the menu, but the atmosphere is nice.",

Three of us went there and were very happy with our selections.  We started with the Lobster Lettuce Cups which was wonderful.  It had lobster, avocado and fried wontons with vegetable slaw & Sprouts.  The sauce was a sesame ginger sauce.  Plain they were delicious with the sauce they were fantastic.   Everyone enjoyed their entrees.   I had the Seafood Pasta which was phenomenal.  It was loaded with lobster, shrimp, vegetables & parmesan cheese over Angel Hair Pasta.  I asked them to hold the mussels which are also included.  Brought half home as the portion was very generous. My Husband had the Pasta Rustica and was very happy.  He enjoyed all the flavors...the spicy sausage sauce drizzled with creamy parmesan sauce and topped with grilled chicken.  He said he would definitely go back. Our friend had the Chicken Parmesan over Angel Hair Pasta and also had to bring half home because it was so much.  She said it was delicious. YES we all recommend this restaurant!",

I have to say that it is a nice element that makes up the whole of the Arizona Center. The tilapia was a good dish and pretty much cooked to perfection. The accompanying pilaf and asparagus were also well prepared. The service was spotless until it came time to pay the check. Granted, the waitress did have about fifteen people walk in right after she dropped the bill, but having to waive the manager down to run your card is an effort one should not have to make. That is the only reason, however, that I did not give 1130 a four out of five rating.",

To start our hostess has a bit if chip on her shoulder when we didn't know if we were going to have 11 or 13 guests at a set of tables that was set up for 16...not sure what the issue was, but she made it clear it was frazzling her.   Service wasn't cheery either, stoic is the best description.   Our humus came out without enough bread, cucumber, carrots for the portion of humus. It was like you get three each and then I'll sprinkle some paprika on the plate to make it look fancy.   The big knock was my chicken sandwich, which was disgusting. The chicken looked bloody, veins and maybe even pink. My coworkers (same sandwich) was completely undercooked. Another coworkers chicken kabob was suspect as well. Not the food you want raw. Plating is so so basic and seems like everything comes out on an oversized plate making you feel like you got small portions. There was no condiments provided either.   Not a fan, head over to Jefferson St, way better options.",

    "text": "I would not recommend this place to anyone for any reason. I came here for my birthday and as soon as we walked in and saw it completely dead on a Saturday night I wanted to leave. I stayed despite my instinct and it was definitely a mistake.   The place just had a really sad vibe, no energy, extremely dark with intense, headache inducing pendent lights shining in your face over every table. Our server was clearly overwhelmed and seemed super uncomfortable when she asked me for my ID, definitely did not observe the date on it, and didn't even look at my boyfriends although she asked for both of ours. The manager came by at one point and made the same comments about how much of our food we'd eaten as I overheard her saying to another table before. The volume of her voice was more appropriate for an Applebee's...   The mojitos and the spinach artichoke dip were good enough, no complaints at all there. My main dish was chicken and it was absolutely underwhelming. I forgot what my boyfriend even got. The food was bland and there seemed no effort put in to make it look or taste appetizing. The chicken I got was really bad, it had been pounded flat to near nonexistence, resulting in a super chewy, over cooked, unseasoned sad little thing hidden under a bunch of equally boring shrimp and sauce. At the end of the experience I was so bummed I wanted to cry, totally not worth over $100 for two people, and it felt like a waste of a special occasion that I'll never get back.   I would not ever go here again or recommend it to anyone.",

The shrimp cocktail appetizer was covered in some overly sweet tomato sauce. My Cosmo (in honor of the movie, of course) was super saccharin with just a hint of vodka. I know you're doing a special promotion, but why not use that opportunity to impress potential customers? Also, the service was less than impressive and a bit curt.   I say pass. If you want inoffensive bar food, try Coach and Willie's or Majerle's instead.",

The salmon was supposed to have an orange glaze, but I didn't taste it.  It was served on skewers in a 'tee-pee' over field greens with an absolutely delicious sesame soy dressing and a bit of refreshing mango salsa.  The Benedict was delicious:  eggs poached just right, a generous portion of (I think) sirloin steak and just the right tang to the Hollandaise.  The english muffin could have been toasted more, but I wasn't planning to eat that part anyway.  The home fried potatoes were a winner!  Service was friendly and unobtrusive.

I arrived about 15 minutes early but decided to get a table and start on a cocktail.  I may as well have waited outside as the server was absentee.  When he finally arrived, he did apologize however.  We ordered the lobster lettuce cups and sweet chili calamari.  The lobster cups were chunks of lobster meat, avocado, and a veggie slaw-really good.  We ordered the calamari at the server's suggestion.  I am not generally a huge fan of calamari, but this was soooo gooood.  Perfectly cooked, and the sweet chili sauce was just enough to give it a little zing, but not overpower the dish.  And the serving was HUGE, and I'm an eater.  I was sorry we didn't have time to finish it.  I considered dumping it in my purse, but not sure the other theater patrons would have appreciated that.  Happy hour prices are great as well.  I think our bill came to $30 for a glass of wine, a specialty drink, and the two appetizers.  Definitely four stars for happy hour in spite of the slow start.  I'll have to try dinner next time.",

    "text": "I'm surprised to see all the great reviews for this place - I think its terrible in many ways...  I work across the street and my coworkers and I often head over to the AZ center for Happy Hour. We've tried 1130 a few times and each time leave disappointed. This place tries to be more than it is and charges a pretty penny for its mediocre food and horrible service. I've been in there when there are only 2 other tables filled in the entire place and not seen my waiter for 20 minutes. My glass empty and my group ready for another round.  On our last trip, we got there 10 minutes before they started happy hour - they wouldn't serve us at happy hour prices, so we said come back in 10 minutes then. Most places I've been will gladly serve you and just wait to punch in the order in a few minutes, but 1130 was not interested in do this. So, after 10 minutes, no waiter. 25 minutes, no waiter. Some goofy dude came out after a while and told us our waiter was getting dressed and would be right out.... Another 10 minutes later, she made her way out and we finally got our order in!!  When she brought our beers ( 2 8th Streets, 2 Blue Moons) she handed us the glasses - who does that? Every place I've ever been sits them on the table rather than awkwardly hand them to you risking spilling it all over you... Whats worse is the pint glasses weren't even full!! They looked as though our late dressing waitress had taken a fat gulp out of them on her way to our table!!  We also ordered some Calamari, luckily it was happy hour so it was 1/2 way affordable, but it was heavy on the garnish and few on the calamaris. There were 4 of us and you know how it is when you share an ap, nobody wants to be the one to finish it - well, our waitress finally made her way back to our table (after I had an empty glass for over 10 minutes) and without asking took the plate of calamari! For RUDE! Paws off lady, ask first before grabbing at our food.   Overall, this place is trying to be way more than it actually is. Its way overpriced for what you get. The service is horrendous - and I say that only after giving it several tries. It might be an okay place to grab a drink (it is cozy afterall) but even at $3.25 happy hour pints, it ain't cheap. I just don't see it lasting long at that location.",

The food was excellent and we always come for $2 mimosas during brunch on saturdays/sundays.   Once we entered, we were seated within a few minutes (they were making a table for our larger party). We got our first round of mimosas, and we were impressed. Very good blend of OJ and champagne, not too much of either.   The selection of food is realllllllly good. They offer brunch from 11-3 on sat/sun and the specials are amazing. We had a lobster omelette, which was AMAZING. It was a decent-sized omelette with 5-6 huge chunks of lobster on top and mixed into the omelette. They do top it with quite a lot of sauce, so if you are not a sauce kind of person, I would recommend getting it on the side.   We also had walnut-maple pancakes, which were very good as well. They were a little cold when we got them, but they were still good. Another person orded the grilled salmon sandwich and another got steak eggs benedict. Everyone was pleased.   For 3 rounds of mimosas and 5 entrees, the bill came out to about $100. Not cheap but definitely not expensive. We ate outside in perfect weather on a saturday morning, so the whole experience was relaxing. I will continue to come back here over and over again.",

We were seated immediately in a restaurant that was fuller than we had ever seen it. Our server came quickly, and proved to be adequate, but her style needed some polish. Maybe you could wait more than 2 seconds after giving us the drink menu to ask what we want? Anyway, they were out of Fat Tire, to Hubby's disappointment, but I enjoyed my Stella on tap.   Hubby ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken (subbed for the shrimp). Bad choice, simply because he had just had Pizza a Metro's gnocchi with Alfredo the other day. No one but Mario Batali might top Maurizio's glorious sauce (Hubby just chimed in with \"yeah, and that's a *maybe*\") . We discovered that the honey butter cheesy bread was now quite different- no discernible honey and too much cheese.   So why the four stars, when nothing yet seems to have been really stellar? The steak, my friends, the steak. Ribeye, medium rare, Classic Phoenix Seasoning. Pretty damn near perfect. The best steak I've had in a long time. I'll be back for more.",

    "text": "We went here on a Saturday afternoon and this place was incredibly empty.  They had brunch specials going on, including $2 bloody mary's and mimosas, but we were more in the mood for lunch.  Except for the bloody mary, I had to try one.  It came out in a high-ball-sized glass.  Boo!  But it was really tasty. Yay!  The hubby remembered a sign outside the restaurant a few weeks back that said they had Arrogant Bastard, and he got a 22 oz bottle for $4.75.  Hey, that's not fair!!  Next up: the wings.  We were a bit hesitant to order them when the waitress informed us that they are \"seasoned\" but not sauced, so they can't be ordered hot.  We did ask for them crispy though, and the waitress even asked the cooks to throw them back in for a few minutes when they came out not visibly crispy.  These non-traditional wings were actually pretty damn good.  The seasoning was a little spicy and salty with just a hint of sweet.  If I were in the mood for the tang and kick of Frank's Hot Sauce, these wouldn't cut it, but otherwise they were good enough to go back again for.  My entree was the Tilapia salad, and I was a bit disappointed.  The fish was a bit dry and uninspired. And the greens underneath were overdressed and wilted.  I ate the greens around the fish and picked out the almonds and Mandarin oranges, but I had to leave the mush hiding underneath the fish.  It wasn't bad enough to say I wouldn't go back, but I won't be anxiously awaiting my next trip.",

We made unnecessary reservations (don't you just hate that - you make a reservation and the place is empty??) for 5:45 PM because we were seeing ATC's Enchanted April at the Herberger, and I needed to be at the theatre by 7:15 PM.   Heather had the Raspberry Cosmo and I had the Bellini-Tini (vodka and peach schnapps). Both were delicious!  For dinner, Heather got the Pasta Rustica, and I had the Smothered Chicken. I devoured my meal. The grilled chicken was on rice pilaf and was definitely smothered in a Red Pepper cream sauce. Then, the chicken was topped with goat cheese and spinach. Yum!   Heather liked her pasta dish too, but she tasted mine and said that next time she'll get the chicken.  While I nursed my one drink, Heather enjoyed a cup of french roast coffee that came out in a French press and smelled heavenly.   As we walked over to the theatre, Heather commented, \"That was a really great meal.\"   I agree.",

    "text": "What better way to spend a night out on the town (downtown Phoenix style) than to over-indulge in a three course dinner at 1130, the Arizona Center's newest fine dining establishment? Their wine list and menu alone should be enough to intice you into trying this cool new locale out, but instead you get the added bonus of a warm and welcoming atmosphere, excellent service, and a hip. new urban vibe.   Start off with an apetizer, which is half off during happy hour. I highly reccomend the Spinach and Artichoke dip served hot in a dainty au gratin dish along with tri-color tortilla chips. Their queso and crab dip is pretty stellar as well, packed with flavor, the calories in it are worth it!   Lunch and dinner menus are slightly different, but cater to those on a budget and those who want to live a little. Vegetarian? Try the Veggie Platter! Grilled asparagus, a portabella mushroom steak, roasted tomatoes, rice pilaf blend, and the best sauteed spinach I have ever had in my life. This meal is inexpensive, filling, and can suit the needs of even the biggest meat eater.   Is steak more your arena? 1130 may not look like the run of the mill Southwestern steak house, but they do compete with the best offering a multitude of rubs, toppings, and choice cuts. I highly reccommend their delmonico steak \"black and bleu\" style paired with a glass of pinot noir and vegetable sides.   But don't forget to save some room for desert! Mango Key Lime pie is pretty decent, but it is all about their S'More Chocolate-- a warm fresh-baked brownie with grand marnier, toasted marshmallow, and whipped cream. French press coffee and Republic of Teas are also available to help you unwind after such a satisfying meal.   A great date place.",

Kinda felt like the zombie apocalypse a little bit. But I guess they are busiest during the week for lunch and happy hour. I liked how they kept a glass bottle full of water on the table so we could refill our drinks. I ordered the Backyard Burger (bacon, cheese, BBQ sauce) with fries. I figured since we were practically the only people in there that our food would come out somewhat quickly, but it still took awhile. The food was good though. You could see the seasoning on the fries and I was afraid it would be too much, but they were actually good. I enjoyed my burger too. Definitely a quiet environment (aside from the poppy music) to chat and catch up around that time. Also, you can park in the garage and they validate your parking. Maybe I will try Sunday brunch one day...",

And I always like an excuse to linger in downtown Phoenix and people-watch after the sun goes down and the trees in the AZ Center light up. Secondly, I've become somewhat addicted to their wings ever since being invited here a couple of times on somebody else's dollar. They're really perfectly seasoned with just enough peppery heat. Mind you, this is not my favorite place in Phoenix for hot wings when I am on that mission, but these are a very compelling appetizer.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover they offer a 10%-off discount if you check in through Yelp on your mobile phone. They already had me at Happy Hour drink and appetizer discounts, but another break on the price is always welcome.  Consider checking out 1130 if you're catching a movie at the cinemas in the Arizona Center. You could always go for a plate of wings instead of a movie theater hot dog, couldn't you?

The friendly staff are really helpful and of course, not surprisingly upscale. From drink order preferences to food order specifics, they nailed it! I am earnestly impressed with this establishment and their 5-star service. Their prices are fair, and their food is exquisite. Thank you 1130! You guys are the best.",

A young gentleman by the name of Jarrod waited on us and all I have to say \"What a delight.\"  I tried the steam mussels accompanied by the lobster lettuce cups.  Both items were perfectly prepared!  My team and will definitely come back again, Especially to see Jarrod!",

The hostess was MIA from the post and I waited over twenty minutes for someone to take my name. Upon giving my name I was told their was a 15 min wait however; another couple came in after us with NO RESERVATION and was seated.  I was then offered a seat outside which I was extremely displeased with. There after the waiter took twenty minutes or more to come take our orders. I eventually left with no meal and hungry.. I am unsure if it has to do with my race or under the assumption that I had no money either way I was unhappy and I well not be going their to grab food or suggesting this restaurant to others.",

I ordered a mojito, which was good, but having to walk over to the bar for happy hour prices was annoying. I understand it's the policy but really killed my desire to order more drinks. Staff seemed overwhelmed by our large party, which they had been expecting, as we'd made a reservation; it was hard to get ahold of our server. Just overall an \"okay\" experience. Not terrible, but nothing really convinced me that I need to go back.",

The restaurant is quite large with a spacious dining area, full bar with seating area, and a patio.   Despite this, my friends and I had a good time during happy hour. We sat in the bar area, staff is very attentive and friendly (maybe because we were 1 of 3 tables) The food is great. Salad, burgers, veggie appetizers, you name it. On a separate occasion I came here on a Sunday for brunch and ordered an eggs Benedict... Lame. It was on a large fluffy English muffin with a sad little piece of ham in the middle, and the hollandaise sauce was mediocre. I forced one in but left the second one on my plate. Did not like. On the bright side, mimosas are amazing! They made it on the top 3 of my favorite mimosa list. Definitely recommend this place.",

    "text": "Eh.... What can I say? It's a nice place. The steak is cooked well for ordering medium rare. The vegetables, were however pretty darn good. That's a start!   Okay okay. I'll be very honest. They need to replace their chef and revamp their pricing and their menu. It's Biltmore pricing for a downtown venue. Most people that go downtown are not looking to make an impression by going somewhere fancy looking and pricey. We're looking for great taste and good value, which I feel this place is lacking. If it's worth twenty to thirty something dollars a plate, I'll come back and keep on spending it.   My experience here wasn't bad. It was date night and I wanted steak. Our server was very sweet and decently educated about wine (though I'm no expert myself). The bread they serve at the table is very good. Then again, I guess it has to be as we ate all of it before our food came out. As I stated earlier, my steak was cooked wrong - but I was too hungry to wait for another one.   I forget what Dena got... I think some sort of seafood pasta? I tasted it and was just okay.   The wine was good!   When it all comes down to it, the over a hundred dollars I spent... I would much rather go to Durant's or Cibo. Hell, I'd rather cook at home and get a vintage wine for that money.   Sorry 1130. I don't like writing negative reviews, but honesty is important. Switch it up and we'll give you another shot.",

    "text": "Let's cut to the chase:  This place was AMAZING!  My girlfriend and I discovered this place on the first day of Phoenix Comic Con and ended up eating here every day, sometimes twice!  Absolutely everything was top notch, but I'll go into more detail.  Food:  We tried something different every time we went and were never disappointed. I had a cheeseburger and a turkey bacon cheeseburger on two of the days, and I'm doing a low-carb diet but they were very accommodating when I asked for a lettuce wrap instead of a bun.  I had two different steaks, a New York Strip and a Ribeye, both cooked to perfection.  During lunch I had a meal from the \"Lighter Fare\" menu, and was welcomed by one of the best grilled chicken breasts I've ever had!  Oh!  And the fruit!  I ended up having a small fruit bowl with every meal because their fruit bowl, which at the time that I had it consisted of melon, cantaloupe, pineapple, and grapes, was the freshest, juiciest fruit I've ever had at a restaurant.  I don't even usually like melon, but it was so fresh and juicy that I became an immediate fan (as evidenced by the fact that I ordered it as a side every single day).  I had two desserts during my time there, a raspberry sorbet which was terrific, but OH MY GOD let me tell you about a S'More Souffle.  There may not be a more decadent, or delicious, dessert on the face of the planet.  If I could eat it every day of my life, the heart attack I had at age forty would be worth it.  Staff:  I never had a bad experience with the staff.  Every one of our waiters/waitresses was timely, friendly, attentive, and made us feel welcome and never rushed or pushy.  The managers even came out several times to see how we were doing and were extremely personable.  By the second day they knew us by name and went out of their way to make us feel welcomed and valued.  Bar none the absolute best service I've ever had.  Wait time:  Let's be honest, although we understand the necessity of it, no one likes to wait, and this place is a diamond in the rough.  Even on the most crowded day of Comic Con (Saturday) with an extra 50,000 people in the area we never had to wait for a seat.  Our servers came over immediately and took out drink orders, the managers came out and talked to us, the servers brought our drinks and took our food orders, we got our food within 10 minutes, we ate, got the check, and left within an hour.  Not that we would have minded staying longer than an hour, because it was a very nice atmosphere, but the entire staff was really on top of the ball.  Four days, six meals, and never a single moments wait for a table or an order.  Price:  And here's the other big issue.  For all this amazing food and wonderful service, surely you have to pay out the nose, right??  Wrong. Everything was very fairly priced.  The most expensive meal we ever had was less than a hundred dollars, and for that, we had two great steaks with extra sides, two glasses of wine, a cup of coffee, and a glass of tea.  And that was just the most expensive trip, although, admittedly, this was after a 10% Convention discount.  The cheapest trip, during which we both had wonderful filtered water, a single glass of tea, and we both ordered from the \"Lighter Fare\" daytime menu, which filled us both up nicely, came out to less than twenty-five dollars.  All in all, even discounting the convention discount, everything was very affordable.  Basically, I can't say enough good things about 1130.  They treated us like royalty, gave us great service, great food, and didn't break the bank.  If you ever find yourself in the downtown Phoenix area, I HIGHLY recommend treating yourself to a visit to 1130!",

It wasn't hard to find an easy walk from or hotel. We were greeted and seated right away. The service was polite and the atmosphere was pretty light. We placed our order and tended to our children. Our drinks and appetizers rolled out pretty quick however this is where it goes from a 4 - 5 star to a 2. They refilled my drink but nobody else's at the table during the rest of the night. We ordered steaks and while they came out tender they were pretty bland with no seasoning. Our waiter didn't come around until after we were finished with the meal. We were not given enough silverware so I had to ask the hostess for another set. Sorry to say we will go somewhere else tonight.",

    "text": "Well, what can I say about 1130?  Its a great break-up spot, great place to wait one hour for a simple pasta dish, and a great place to get service that will strangely remind you of that girl in HS that, no matter what you did, you couldn't get her attention.  Seriously though, I would not recommend this place!  The restaurant itself has a nice ambiance and is inviting.  However, almost immediately you notice that the waiters don't really seem interested or are not too friendly (mind blowing for a job that is all about hospitality).  A friend of mine didn't want a sauce on her pasta and the waiter didn't acknowledge her when she double checked the order.  I flagged him down after he abruptly left so I could make sure the order was correct and his answer was \"Yeah... I heard her\" to which my response was \"A reply of receipt would be nice!\"    The kitchen was also poor on delivery time.  The restaurant was more than 3/4 empty and it took a little over an hour to get our food to the table (3 people).  Upon delivery, it was obvious that the food had been left on the plate warmer too long or was cooked to the standards of a college cafeteria.  The pasta was hardened on the outside and the chicken was WAY overcooked (Pasta Rustica.)  Additionally, it was evident that the pasta was not drained thoroughly and/or the sauce had something funky going on because there was a nice pool of water on the bottom of the plate.    Forget getting a hold of your original waiter.  We had to ask two other waiters for service because ours was somewhere in la-la land.    Overall, this place lacks on service and food quality.  I have re-visited restaurants that lack in service but serve great food.  This place has neither and will leave you wanting for WAY more.",
