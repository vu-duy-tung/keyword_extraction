Your in line for about 5 minutes then you get to place your order. Nice menu with lots of choices. You can add or change what you want which is a plus (bagel instead of toast). The food came about 10 minutes later and OMG it was wondrful.!!!!!!!. Let's start with the coffee, best I  have had in a long time.  My apple chicken sausage scramble melted in my mouth.  My husband's omlett was so perfect .would we go back. How about tomorrow",

    "text": "Pretty sweet place for breakfast or brunch, operates in fairly efficient manner, with lots of bagel types, spread types and sandwiches to choose from. They also double as a coffee shop, have patio seating that's great during this lovely fall AZ weather, and their staff is friendly, patient and knowledgeable about their items.  I ordered a toasted everything bagel with jalepeno cream cheese and a chai latte (sm) for a little over $5. I decided to try lox and they added that on for $2 (a 2oz ramekin). My friend and I sat outside on the patio, which was full, and we ended up stuffed in a corner.  Our bagels came out quickly, within 3-4 minutes, but our drinks took much longer. Both of us were already halfway through our breakfast before our chai lattes were brought to our table.  Quality of food matched the price, bagels were good (if not just a little cold), jalepeno cream cheese was SPICY and the lox was... mehhh I don't know if I'd get it again. My friend had a bagel sandwich and he seemed to enjoy that too.  I'd see myself stopping in here pre-IKEA day-long shopping adventure, but I'd like to see the drinks come out at the same time or even before the food.",

First, repeatedly, time after time, the decaf coffee is either empty, almost empty, cold, or cold AND almost empty.  Secondly, today we discovered that if you order a piece of toast all by itself, you get charged $2.75. So, $1.09 for a bagel, but $2.75 for a measily piece a toast. What a ripoff.  Come on guys, step it up. Both of these criticisms need to be taken seriously.",

You go up to the counter and order so service is minimal and when they flip the screen it automatically says 15 or 20%. I don't think either is appropriate when you serve yourself. I would definitely go back.",

The food here is barely above 3 stars, more like 3.5.  I've rated this place a 4 for reasons I'll list a little later.  I like independent breakfast joints.  They usually have something special or different that the big chains lack.  Like I said, the food here is generally 3.5-level.  There are a lot of microwaves here. But it bumps up to a 4 for a the following:  the bacon here is thick and good, the coffee was also solid, they have hash browns that are served crispy, and they have the \"Not So Common\" - a plate with 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and an order of biscuits and gravy.  I've never seen this combo at any other place as a plate, and it's $8.  It's almost all my favorite breakfast foods on a single plate, and this alone almost warrants the bump to 4 stars.  The pancakes here are average.  The hashbrowns taste average.  The biscuit was ok.  Ordered a plain bagel, untoasted, with cream cheese.  Can't even compare this thing to NYC or Montreal or some other bagel joints - it was not that good.  BUT, all those things listed above, bring up the rating.",

The Nosh is known for their bagels and due to managements lack of proper preparation and being proactive instead of reactive, they had almost no bagels. Instead of hyping up his team, you could see him giving them attitude and being frustrated with them. Unfortunate great workers are doing what they can and still doesn't seem to be good enough for their manager.",

    "text": "Great breakfast and lunch joint.   The apple smoked chicken sausage scramble and the sausage, mushroom and tomato scramble are two of my faves. After one bite, it's hard to go back to having plain old oatmeal or sucky cereal at home. Unless it's Cap'n Crunch of course.   There's other tasty options here including fresh bagels, scratch made buttermilk pancakes with pecan butter, breakfast burros, salads, and sandwiches - if you aren't feeling so eggy. And their portions are quite big, so do come hungry!  The people who work here are very friendly and helpful. My first visit, I had no idea what to order because their menu is a smorgasbord of splendid. They gave me great recommendations - the scrambles and omelettes, and it made me want to come back as a result. They also work hard to make sure your dining experience isn't weak sauce.  Also, The Nosh Cafe is a nice, free wi-fi zone, so don't forget to bring your laptop or touchpad with you and get some actual work or budgeting done. Or better yet...scroll endlessly through your facebook feed and compare yourself to all your successful and not-so-successful friends from high school. All while scarfing down bacon and eggs.  That should bring the feels.  Since I normally work from home, it's great to get a change of scenery. Especially when it's a restaurant where one can destroy a delicious omelette or scramble and not feel so bad afterwards - like when eating at a breakfast joint that rhymes with Benny's.   Oh, I almost forgot - you can purchase a fresh cup of coffee here and get multiple refills! I make sure to lose track of the amount of coffee refills, so  that when I am reunited with my exhausted wife - I just explode energy. She absolutely loves that.",

It has a very nice contemporary feel and a very complete breakfast menu for being such a small place.  The few times I have been here they have been pretty packed and it can get a bit iffy as you wait for your to go order.  You seem to be in the way no matter where you go.  Aside from that the bagels are delicious, the breakfast burritos are really great and they have excellent OJ.  What more can you want from a breakfast place?  I tried the pancakes which were really good. As is normal for the area they are way bigger than any standard human needs.  They come in three, two, or one.  I went for two, next time it will just be a single.  If you decide to get the three stack bring some hungry friends.  Try: - Pancakes - Breakfast Burrito - Bagels",

Very friendly, welcoming staff.  I went there today, just after the morning rush and they seemed very genuine in saying hello and wishing me a great day.  I love the coffee and I love that coffee at these family owned places is usually better than the chain places and also less expensive.  Score!  They have a great selection of bagels and cream cheese, breakfast and lunch sandwiches.  My favorite sandwich is the Nosh Veggie!  Stacked with fresh veggies that really make the bagel sandwich quite refreshing.  Depending on my mood I may get it on a Jalapeno Cheese bagel, or Wheat, or Sesame, or, well, you get the point.  The best part is getting the Garlic Feta Dill cream cheese with all those veggies!  My mouth is watering right now!!  Tons of bicycle folks hanging out on a Saturday morning and a common place for police officers on the weekdays.  Great little spot in the tuke for a casual, quick breakfast or lunch.",

We came for lunch right before it closed so there weren't many people the workers were extremely friendly and they seem to get along well. Since they were about to close they did not have the bagel I originally wanted but I tried the blueberry with plain cream cheese, most bagels taste the same but I think that the flavor was much better than most. We also had the tombstone wrap with a spinach wrap, it was a little spicy but not overpowering. There was a lot of bacon, which isn't my favorite, but if you like bacon then this sandwich is for you! I will definitely be eating here again.",

The next day I went back to get the \"Go Bananas\" bagel sandwich which was bananas, PB and agave nectar- also, incredible.   Even though I was in town just a few days for work, whenever I am in Phoenix, I will make sure to stop by this gem an maybe try the pancakes or french toast :).",

Roast beef, tuna, even LOX!  YUMMY.  They also coffee, and some juices and pop as well.  Yippie!  What else I like about this place, is that its just not bagels.  They also have a variety of pastries to choose from, like muffins, and other stuff too.  What else I like about this place is that there is plenty of outdoor seating.  Thats a bonus!

They have a wide variety on their menu.  You can go for a scramble, omelette, breakfast sandwich, or something as simple as a bagel.  I decided on the chicken sausage scramble, and I was not disappointed.  The portion was much larger than I expected.  Eggs, chicken sausage, spinach, and cheese all combined in one tasty dish.  They didn't skimp on the meat, which was much appreciated.    Not only was the food tasty, but the prices were super reasonable considering the massive amount of food you get.  Definitely recommend it.  If we had locations in TN, there's no doubt I would be a breakfast regular.",

Walking in I am interested since of course they carry Cartel coffee (amazing) and make their own bagels fresh everyday. Hours are understandable since this is like a bfast brunch place for me. I ordered the Bagel bfast sandwich. It was a great sandwich which I loved. There are many menu items to choose from but beware the bagels go fast. Sooo... anywho. The Grandpa ordered a salad which I must say he loved. He said the greens were fresh along with the other veggies. By far his fav salad. So that is good. I would definitely come back to this place. And I recommend for you to try. The price is reasonable for the portions.",

While it doesn't look exceptionally huge, but loaded with protein, perfect breakfast before hiking South Mountain or any mountains.  This place is very small and we got lucky to have found a table after a short wait. Friendly staff and they work hard but it seemed they are understaffed from what I saw on the day I visited.

But what I do not like about this establishment is the customer service, especially that of the owner. The counter staff is mediocre at best, they never make eye contact and smile when you approach the counter. They do not say \"good morning\" or \"how are you today?\", and I almost always have to repeat my order 2 to 3x before they get it right. It is amazing what a simple smile and acknowledgement will do for a customer in terms of satisfaction.  But unfortunately I don't feel it is their fault, because it all trickles down from the owner. In ALL of the years I have entered this establishment she has not once looked at me, smiled, or acknowledged my existence in any manner, even when she has handed me my food directly. She runs around with her head down, without any smile or look of joy in her eye, and she constantly interacting with her staff in a manner that is not very pleasant. I understand she is working hard and has many responsibilities as the owner, but as a business owner myself I know the importance of customer service and positive interactions with employees.  Anyhow, like I said, food is great, this is what keeps me coming back. But if quality of food were to slip,  I would not return due to customer service.  Just my opinion...for what it's worth.",

It's convenient to go there since it's on the way to work, but I will gladly go out of my way from now on to go to Einstein's and likely pay more just to get my order correct. I like to support local if possible, but I can do so no longer here.",

I know the place offers more than just bagels now but I haven't had the chance to try them so I will stick to my experience. I regularly order a bacon egg and cheese on an everything (works) bagel. I enjoy the quality but here are my issues. Microwaved eggs. I mean really can we get something that doesn't look like it came from subway's breakfast menu this leaves the \"eggs\" unevenly cooked usually with a hot spot and a flavor that doesn't make you think fresh ingredients.   The bagel even toasted feels greasy and burned in spots because the toaster that it goes through hasn't been cleaned since the bought it and it flames up sometimes.   I will say I prefer this place over Einstein's any day especially Monday's when the bagel man on 51st/Elliot is closed but my money goes to the bagel man 9 times out of 10 now.  If you want to know what a real bagel should taste like head there instead.",

    "text": "After repeatedly going to a few of the same breakfast / brunch places, we figured we would try somewhere new! The Nosh Cafe came up in our Yelp search, so we went at around 11am on Saturday. There was only a short line in the front where they take orders, and I'm not sure how busy the cafe usually gets, but we were able to snag an empty table right away after ordering.   I got a create your own sandwich: toasted jalapeno cheese bagel with veggie cream cheese, turkey, tomatoes, sprouts, red onions, and cucumbers. The sandwich came with either a bag of chips, potato salad, or pasta salad; I chose the potato salad. My fiance ordered the Mediterranean Omelet which had olives, onions, tomatoes, artichokes, spinach, & feta cheese. It came with a side of hash browns.  The first thing we noticed when our order was brought out to us is how large the portions were! The bagel sandwich had a ton of turkey on it along with very thinly sliced veggies. I thought it was good, however it didn't have any unique flavors that I haven't been able to get in the same type of sandwich elsewhere. I did consider when I initially ordered that their non-custom-made sandwiches would maybe be more unique, so I'd be willing to come back to try one of those.  The Mediterranean omelet, similar to the sandwich, was stuffed with a ton of toppings as well. My fiance really liked it and was happy that they didn't skimp on anything, but he did say that the hash browns were just okay. We were not certain if they offer another side with the omelet but if we returned, he would definitely ask about it.  Overall, we had a good experience! Unfortunately, I can't see myself driving out of my way to come here, however it would be somewhere I would consider stopping by if I were already in the area.",

We ordered finally and they ring in the order on one tab and then the girl typed in the total on the square and ended up over charging me. They gave me back cash to fix it once I realized what happened. You can watch them pour the \"eggs\" from a pitcher and cook them in the microwave. I got a bagel, egg and cheese sandwich, boyfriend got a chorizo burrito. My eggs were brownish green. The bagel was alright. The burrito was okay, chorizo was hard to find there.  And A large cold brew is $5 which is a bit much. Overall it was pretty awful, which is a bummer.",

Food:  I get a bagel sandwich with bacon egg and cheese on everything bagel with chive cream cheese, melts in your mout!! The bagel is doughy but yet has a firm texture on the outside reminds me of an authentic New York bagel.  My kids love the breakfast grilled cheese with sausage egg and cheese. It's extremely cheesy yet the bread is perfectly toasted. Think of a panini and grilled cheese met at breakfast and had a baby.  Lastly let's talk about the coffee!!! Perfectly balanced, aromatic notes and strength. For a coffee drinker like myself who prefers my coffee just black straight up it as the perfect flavor.   I'm excited to come here for lunch and when I come back for breakfast I must try the pancakes all in all this is our new favorite spot.",

I paid almost 7 dollars for a bagel with strawberry cream cheese and a mocha coffee, which would have been fine if they were good. My bagel had a substance I couldn't identify on it and the cream cheese was more like yogurt. Not pleasant! Then when I was handed my coffee it was leaking all over the place which was very disappointing as it was a TO GO order and most of it ended up all over my car. The first sip I took over 20 mins after ordering burnt my mouth!!! I'm assuming because the girl making my coffee was too busying chatting and had steamed the milk she added to my coffee to the point it overflowed onto the counter. The person she was chatting with was her manager who was standing right there and saw all of this. I can't believe she proceeded to give me this coffee after that. So disappointed I dont know that I'll ever return which is unfortunate because I live so close. Would NOT recommend!!",

Much better than those at Einstein's... I am pretty sure that place uses powdered eggs.  However, I think I do like the bagels better at Einstein's and they have more flavored cream cheese.  I will probably come to Bagel Nosh again b/c I prefer to support the locally owned businesses over chains but I am not really sure if this place deserves the 4 1/2 stars it currently has.  Maybe part of that is due to my bad experience there.  I ordered a latte with my bagel sandwhich and it took a long time to come out, even after the food.  Then when I finally got it instead of coffee they had given me hot chocolate.  A simple mistake but it can be really jarring when your mouth is expecting one thing and you get another.  Plus I really don't like sugar in the morning and this was extremely sugary sweet.  They did replace it with the latte I ordered but it made me a little grumpy to have to wait so long for my coffee on a Sunday morning so it kind of ruined my day.  I will definitely give them another try and may raise the stars higher in the future.  But I think there are better bagel places in the area.  I LOVE Back East Bagels on Southern and I deeply miss Bruegger's that used to be on Rural and Chandler Blvd - they were the best!",

Hubby ordered the Lox and Works and said it was good, but that they actually gave too much lox, which is unusual for him. (He figures they are losing money on it and could save if they slimmed down the amount they gave.) I used some of his lox on my garlic bagel but was slightly disappointed that the garlic bagel had too much garlic on it, which, when toasted got burned. I love garlic and would've thought garlic would have been in the bagel also not only only on the top. I do think it's a little on the pricey side, but it's local so will support it. All in all, I know I'll go again since it's close to my work and may have to give the glacier a try since others have raved about it.",

    "text": "This was our first time visiting on a Saturday at 11 ish for some brunch. It was busy as to be expected. Wait time for food wasn't bad considering. Staff was friendly. I got the lox and works and my husband got the chorizo burrito. The burrito wasn't bad. My husband said he didn't like that it was meat heavy compared to the other ingredients in it. He also didn't feel the burro was worth $7 of food. I was very disappointed with my lox and works. There was a very small amount of salmon and it was covered in cream cheese. All I could taste was cream cheese with a hint of caper and tomato between a bagel. It was way too cream cheese heavy. I was scraping off what I could, trying not to lose capers. The taste was just unbalanced. It needed more salmon and less cream cheese. Not worth the $9. Maybe we came at a bad day? Maybe we ordered the wrong things? But this is what we like. I guess we just have a different taste with what we ordered. We will probably not be back as there are a couple places closer that have the same burrito and lox and works for a cheaper price and it's done the way we like it. There was nothing else that interested me on the menu, otherwise I'd give it another try. It ended up being too similar to the downtown Chandler cafe...just not as good.",

My husband got his food first after about a ten minute wait. It took an additional 10 minutes before my little daughter and myself got our food, by which time my husband's food went cold from waiting. My omelet was bland with no seasoning on it. My daughter's nutella crepe was good. My husband ordered the pancake breakfast, and again no salt or pepper even seasoned the eggs. That's a pretty basic cooking flaw. So between the food being so-so and the having to wait for the food to be separately so far apart we were not impressed.",

The bagel was 1. Huge 2. Soft and chewy 3. Completely satisfying. The eggs were fluffy and the sausage was flavorful too making for an excellent bagel sandwich. The hashbrowns were also yummy. They were buttery without being greasy, salty and had just the right amount of crispiness. I tried a bite of my friend's pancake and that was good too - very fluffy.  The service was friendly and fast, too. The only downside was that it was a little loud inside. They did have a few tables outside but they were full. Next time if it's not too hot I would probably go outside for a little quiet. But either way, I'll be back!",

Let me start off by saying I usually never write bad reviews and tend to just brush a bad experience off or give them the benefit of the doubt. However this experience actually affected me beyond just my order. This was my first time at Nosh cafe and my last. I had work at 10 a.m and so I woke up early in order to get coffee and breakfast. After I left Starbucks in the bashas next door, I went to Nosh Cafe to try something new at 9:30. I figured I had 20 minutes to spare and since it was a breakfast place I figured they could get a simple to go order of a simple bagel with spread in under 20 minutes. I was very wrong. 20 minutes pass by and still no bagel and several people who ordered before me were still waiting for their bagel so I had to call my manager and let them know I had already paid for my food and could not just leave and that I would be a little late. Thankfully my manager is very understanding and told me not to worry about being late. After I got off the phone, at 9:55 they decide to tell me they don't have the bagel to complete my order. I was in disbelief because they had not started my order even though it had been 25 minutes. I told them I was already late for work and to just give me my money back or give me a different bagel in 30 seconds so I could leave. They were able to get that bagel out in record time surprisingly. I will not be coming back it was very slow service and not to mention the food was not worth that wait or being late for work.",

It was served with hash browns, but theres also hash browns in the omelet. There was sausage inside as well as cheese. It was covered in a sausage gravy. I was looking forwarded to this gravy, but it was tasteless. Just the first bite of the omelet was just lack luster. The dish only improved once I put ketchup, and I don't usually like to use ketchup. But this seemed like a necessity.   I also ordered a chicken soup. The chicken noodle soup was the best item I tried there. It was very chunky and had flavor. It wasn't the best chicken noodle soup I've had, but it was definitely better than the country omelet, in my opinion.   The coffee was good too.",

We were very disappointed. Ordered a bagel sandwich and a toasted bagel to go. It was pretty busy so we expected some wait, but started getting concerned when we saw the people who ordered before us finish their food before we even got ours. About 25 minutes.  I went up to the counter to see where they were on our order. They had our tickets still with the bagel done. They said the sandwich was being worked on and they would bring it out. So I thought to myself, only one more minute. Nope, 10 more minutes passed. I go up see what they are doing.  They said they were still working on it. The bagel for my wife was now getting cold so I bring that back so she could eat something. I then went back and watched one girl behind the counter pealing cheese slices, while the other girl watched. I'm hoping this was just a bad day, because these girls moved slow. I've done food service. A sandwich takes one minute to make. A bagel the same. We should have received our food within 5 minutes if them starting the order. Wouldn't it be a great customer experience to start and complete an order in a timely fashion? Then bring the food out all at once before it gets cold.   I don't think we will be back anytime soon.",

It sucks but I'll have to be another person to report that this has happened to.  I get that things get backed up or something goes wrong. It's natural and I've been in food service long enough to not complain about waiting a bit longer than usual, but 40 minutes for an omelette seems a bit ridiculous.  I didn't have time to wait any longer for it so I just got a refund instead, so one plus I can say is that the refund process was pleasantly painless.",

Iced tea was good i suppose  Appended: talked to owner, really nice guy, if you want a breakfast sandwich and arent inna hurry, MAKE SURE TO ASK FOR GRILLED SANDWICH, otherwise they do the quick microwave job.

Even when a comment is made to management they just acknowledge the problem and move on. The recent problems and shortcomings are as followed:   Poor seating - no handicap seating or signs suggesting proper etiquette for table arrangements. (1 person sitting at a 4 person table for hours on end with a coffee and their laptop)  Cold food - runners are not quickly delivering food that is ready, as it sits in the window.   Poor customer etiquette which is leading to a declining atmosphere.   I've been a patron since moving to Phoenix in 2012. No longer will I visit the Nosh, nor will I promote it through word of mouth advertising.",

I asked for it to be toasted and it was not. An irregular amount of fake egg product used in the sandwich. So much I had to take it off. In the end I only ate the rest of the meat and left the egg stuff and bagel. All in all the sandwich was bland. Almost no flavor.   To top it off the Latte I ordered wasn't hazelnut. When I went back I learned the ran out. Huh, could have told me. I'm not sure what flavor the gave me but it wasn't hazelnut.  I gave a two because my wife wasn't disappointed in her meal. Just a bagel and cream cheese.",

My only recommendation: call in your order, add an extra 5 minutes to their pick up time and you Will be good. Breakfast burrito and pancakes are always a good choice here  ADDITION: we waited for our order to be called (they call by name) they call our name and totally ignore us giving our order to the guys sitting right next to us. When we go and ask if he had just said \"Kevin\" the owner , without even looking up, completely dismisses us \"no I didn't say Kevin\" but then walks over to the guy and says \"are you Kevin?\" He says no and LUCKILY (or else shit would've hit the fan) the dudes order was exactly our order so their screw up was easily fix.

But then, just as we watched the people after us got served one by one, our food just refused to show up for a good 30 minutes. My patience wore thin at that time and just decided to leave, by when our food was still nowhere to be sighted in the kitchen. Outrageous. Outrageous. Would not recommend this place to anyone.",

While I was waiting over 10 minutes, another lady came up to the counter to discuss an issue with her order. keep in mind there was nobody in front of me and nobody behind me waiting for food.    The younger girl that was working cashier could have cared less about customer service today. She took my money through the bagels and the toaster and then walked to the kitchen and relaxed while my bagels sat on the counter getting cold. Slurped on her drink with no cares in the world.  When the other customer came up to discuss her incorrect order, she didn't even turn around to acknowledge and apologize. The older lady just defended their inaction.  After waiting over 10 minutes for two basic bagels to get some schmear, I told the older lady with curly black hair I would like a refund. Never once did she ask why. She didn't need to. She knows this place sucks.   I really wish this place would fix the issues, but Rob doesn't care, the staff doesn't care. I've never wished a small mom & pop business would close, until now. But glass half full, I hope this place closes so a new owner with passion and priorities will open a new shop.   Called to speak to Rob, of course he's out of town. I truly hate this place and will not be back.",

I used to love coming here because the food is delicious, but the kids running this place and making the food don't have a clue what they're doing.   We came on a Sunday, just ordered a toasted bagel and a turkey bagel. It didn't seem too complicated and it was busy so we expected a wait, but after 25 minutes we went to the counter to see if they forgot about us. After being promised it was going to be done in 15 seconds we came back up after another 10 minutes and they finally decided it was ready. Waiting almost 40 minutes for two stupid bagels is ridiculous. There were tons of other people complaining and asking for the manager because of the long wait or an issue with the food being too cold. I seriously hate whining about anything, but this was just a terrible visit and I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone.",

There is outdoor seating if you don't want to be in the crowded and slightly noisy inside. We live farther away now but it's worth the extra drive.  They are located in a strip mall type location so there is ample parking and places to park your bicycle.   I usually pick apart bathrooms but I don't think I've ever used their facilities, so I can't judge.",

It is self seating after you place your order at the register, get your serving number and sit down. The <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpatio.is&s=86f037dcd21976edeb0a99dd9cacc095356c5346eeecf9b9bcf64164bab00b8b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">patio.is</a> dog friendly, so if you would like to being the fur babies, you can. Our visit, this particular time was, meh, okay. We placed our order, got our number and sat down. It was a cold morning so why they had the side door open so the cold air with a light, but artic breeze, could get in, I do not know. We live in Arizona so I will be honest, I am sensitive to the cold so maybe it felt nice to someone, but it was majorly uncomfortable for us. Luckily, shortly after sitting down, someone may have complained because one of the workers came and shut the door. We ordered 2 yogurt parfaits and a hot chocolate. A lady came out with one yogurt parfait, then wanted to take our number, having had this happen before, I didn't want her taking our number until we received the rest of our order so she asked, \"Well, what else did you order?\" We told her, \"Another parfait and a hot chocolate.\" She looked down at her piece of paper and let out the biggest sigh. Went back. Came back with our other parfait about 10mins later. Took awhile to get the hot chocolate, which did not taste like hot chocolate. It tasted like... hot sugar water. The parfaits were good. The service was lacking but, understandably, I think it may have been because they appeared to be short staffed. Overall, meh. It was okay. We don't expect to come back anytime soon.",

Which looked amazing, so I needed to try it. It comes with chorizo, that I substituted for steak instead.   OHHHH MY GOODNESS. When I took the first bite, it all just melted in my mouth. The green chiles, eggs, hash browns, steak, beans, and all the yummy goodness hit all my taste buds. It was just a special they were having on the weekends that was so popular that they are adding it to the menu now. The green chile was not spicy, to me. It might be for others. I highly recommended trying the Green Chile Burrito.",

    "text": "Decided to stop by The Nosh Cafe for a Saturday morning breakfast prior to hitting the outlet mall for some shopping. There were about 5 people in front of us in line and it remained steady throughout our visit. The line did move quickly and we were able to grab a table to wait for our food after placing our order.   Drinks: My husband ordered a caramel hazelnut latte and he really enjoyed it, I ordered decaf drip coffee and when I went to get some (drip coffee is self serv), there was enough for about a half a cup. No worries though, they brewed more and brought it directly out to me when it was ready.   Food: I ordered the Two x Four which was 2 scrambled eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, whole wheat toast, and hash browns. I wasnt really a fan of any portion of my meal but the toast. The toast, I would come back just to order it, the bread was thick and the toastiness was perfect. They serve it with a strawberry jam that complimented it well. I would order the toast again, and again, but I dont see myself ordering the never eggs or bacon from Nosh again.   Husband had the Pancake breakfast with scrambled eggs and sausage (and he ate my hash browns). He was happy with his meal.  The PANCAKES are phenomenal. They are super fluffy, the pecan butter is so good, and they are huge. In fact, even with me picking at his pancake as we ate, only about 1/2 of 1 pancake was eaten, and he ordered 2. We brought the leftovers home and did not eat them, and I'm not sure if he is going to.   The pancakes, toast, and made to order coffee drinks are worthy of a 5 star rating. Everything else brought it down to an overall 4. I would recommend Nosh Cafe to others and do see this being a place I return to in the future for a pancake and an espresso beverage.",

    "text": "Really had high hopes for this place especially upon arrival. It's hidden which is fine and great location for lots of traffic. Walking to the door you can see the line out the door which means great things always.   Come to find out we were wrong here. Menu and everything looked great till, where it went wrong was after ordering our food.  Drinks came out at a reasonable time, but the smoothie tasted watered down and with frozen strawberries that tasted like they been in the freezer for awhile.    As busy as they were they were completely unorganized.  Even with what it looked like 6 people behind the counter and 4 of them cooking it took at least 30 minutes maybe longer just to get our food.   Food arrives was thinking heck this looks amazing maybe I'll rethink the wait for the food.  Nope not one bit, about to take a bite of my food notice a hair probably nothing big but being mad waiting of course it's now a big deal. Tell the lady about didn't seem apologetic just asked what I wanted to go so I got a bagel so I didnt have to wait.  Then my fiance's food she couldn't finish it tasted like they threw a handful of salt on the potatoes.    After leaving we started reading google reviews, should of read those first.  The way the manager replied made it look like he doesn't care about the customers and just wants there money.   Enter at your own risk but we will no longer be coming here",

    "text": "This place has seriously gone downhill over the past few year. I don't know if the ownership changed, if they lost staff or if they simply don't care about running the business correctly anymore and taking care of customers. The staff is not prepared to handle a crowd, they seem to always run out of food and you could see either one of the staff or a man that seems to be the owner, running to the Bashas next door to purchase things they have run out of. They take over 30 minutes to deliver food, on average, even if it's just a bagel with cream cheese and they seem to have to \"re-make\" a lot of orders that are being delivered wrong. I do have to say this man (owner) seems to be happy to re-make any order a customer is unhappy with, however the question should truly be, WHY is it necessary to re-make orders? Shouldn't they be right, and TIMELY in the first place? and keep in mind these orders are being remade after customers have already had to wait 30 minutes for their food in the first place and it has already been delivered wrong and cold. Does the food taste good? Yeah, it's fine. It's not so \"out of this world incredible\" that I would be willing to put myself through such bad service. Keep in mind they are constantly running to  the grocery store to get pre-prepped stuff to make the food and it's not like it's being made from scratch. The man behind the counter, and sometimes in the kitchen argues this is from scratch, but you tell me that he is telling the truth when you can ask any customer sitting there how many times someone has walked in with a grocery store bag and goes behind the counter to prepare food. I could do the same thing at home without paying the premium price and waiting in line to get a wrong and cold order. Besides all of that, He doesn't seem to treat his staff very well. He has been seen yelling and even cursing at them in the back kitchen and has even directed himself in a not-so polite manner to customers who have gotten upset over their orders. I visited this place at least 15 times thinking I was going at \"the wrong time\" but I quickly figured out, EVERY time is the wrong time.",

The people in front of us in line seemed to have several questions, which made our wait a bit long but it also gave us a chance to really study the menu and choose which bagels we wanted so we knew exactly what we would be ordering once it was our turn.

This is a small place and it's one of those places where you have to fight for a table and people will walk in the door, grab a table as fast as they can, and then send someone up to make the order. They have no regard for folks who are literally standing there with food in their hands who've been waiting for a table for 10 plus minutes. This morning for example, there were four tables nabbed by rude customers that just walked in the door as I clearly stood there with my food. Three other tables had people camped out on them who had finished eating before I even walked in. I really don't get any of these people.",

Not only do they have delicious bagels and cream cheese (try the chive!), they have a number of other breakfast and lunch items. I have loved everything I have tried so far.  As for the service.... It's excellent. Most of the employees know me by name and are always smiling and happy. It'd be one thing to simply get good food, but it's the best experience I really enjoy.  Even when the boss isn't around, they find the perfect mix of friendly and efficient. Do expect to wait a while on the weekends and busy morning hours, but it's for a good reason.  I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to enjoy a nice meal in a nice environment.",

There never seems to be anyone in line (except in the morning hours) so i can order and sit down or be back at the office in no time. they have booths, tables and outside patio tables.   $7 for sandwich, chips and a drink, and it kicks subway or sub factory's ass.   damn i'm hungry.",

Its always a tasty treat and relaxing experience worth looking forward to.  And no matter when I go, I can always count on great bagels, delicious cream cheeses and great service.  I don't think I've ever had negative experience; this is partially due to the owners, Rob and Darcy (sp?), that seem to really try to make the place as friendly and good as they can make it.  One hint about it, try their new Nosh Bars.  They are a little piece of delectable heaven.",

However, the Nosh Bagelry not only has really, really good bagels and cream cheese (with lots of flavors to choose from for both), they also have affordably-priced and delicious bagel sandwiches. My husband and I tried the Nosh Veggie sandwich and the Nosh French Dip. The Veggie was standard but delicious, with veggie cream cheese and a bagel of my choice (I chose onion, naturally), and for only $4.99, I also got potato salad and a pickle. I know the French Dip ($5.99) sounds strange on a bagel, but it was surprisingly really good. The roast beef was decent, and the garlic bagel he chose added a little something special. One delicious touch was that the bagel was buttered; this, along with the au jus, made it rich and flavorful. I will definitely return here for either breakfast or lunch if I'm in the area.",

I specifically asked for my garlic bagel (the last one) to be lightly toasted since I hate burned anything. My husband got a sandwich on a Works bagel and an iced coffee. Everything took way longer than it should have for only a few customers and that nothing we ordered required any cooking. My husband's coffee tasted more like vanilla syrup than anything else, his sandwich was on a sesame seed bagel not the Works like he ordered, and my garlic bagel was burnt black on the top. When I told one of the girls she offered me a free bagel or to remake our meals. We didn't have another 15 minutes to wait for them to remake our meals as slowly as they made them. Sorry when I pay, I expect to get what I ordered and 3 errors on a single order is staff being lazy and clearly not valuing customers time or money.   Additionally the guy sitting next to us who had ordered long before us had to ask for his food. I'm not sure what was going on but I think I saw 4 employees so I'm confused what anyone was doing.",

Even though the girl wrote down the order correctly on the ticket (chorizo scramble) I got a chorizo burro--so I end up paying a dollar extra for an item that's cheaper and not what I ordered.  The food is pretty good itself but pretty basic....definitely not worth the wait and the stress of ordering and getting incorrect items. My experience was very stressful. They have about 6 girls working there all seeming confused and running around in every which way getting things mixed up.

I sadly didn't get to try it until I got to work and by then it was cold but still delicious. It was so good I went back this morning and ordered it again! This time I ate it on my way to work. So yummy when it's warm and toasty! I will probably be back tomorrow and will try to make myself try something new. There are a lot of options!   While I am in love with the bagel, the coffee was just meh. One review on here mentions that the mocha is better than Starbucks. I would have to disagree. Tried the latte today and was also not impressed. I like my coffee to be more on the sweet side though.  Also the older woman who is mentioned in another review is just as you described: short with words and grumpy. It's kind of a turn off but when the bagel is that good I will put up with it!   I don't like the debit card machine and the place to tip. I feel obligated to tip every time because they just look at you waiting for your response. I don't mind tipping but if I'm just getting a to go order is it really necessary?",

Left feedback via square and the owner completely flipped out and sent back a wildly unprofessional response. While the food here is good (usually) the 30+ minute wait time is just unacceptable. I let them know in my feedback that I was dissappointed we waited more than 25min to receive a bagel and french toast, and after saying how everyone works their asses off and that I'm a terrible person for even being upset, their response was that we should have asked where our food was... Okay? Why should I have to ask where my order is, you should be organized and efficient enough to get orders out in a timely manner. To top it all off, they originally gave is a single slice of bread as the $6 french toast we ordered. I could buy a whole loaf of bread and a dozen eggs for cheaper. Plus, it had been sitting in the window so long the butter they put on the side was completely melted and saturated the bread to the point where it was spongy and far too rich to be enjoyable.  Just BEWARE you will be waiting a very long time if you go to the NOSH and only some of the food is worth it. Oh and if you try to give feedback someone will respond with wild and unprofessional accusations rather than try and see what they can do it make it right.",

We had the chorizo burro, the morning beer, and a jalapeno cheddar bagel with veggie cream cheese. They were out of the works bagel, which is why I chose jalapeno. While we were waiting on our good, the young man came outside and said they were out of chibatta, so I had to choose something else for my sandwich. I chose sourdough, and my sandwich was decent. Just lacked wow factor. Chorizo burrito was also ok. Bagel was excellent, as was the veggie cream cheese. Would definitely gone back for bagels and cream cheese!",

When I got there it had a little line, but don't worry, it moves sort of fast, while waiting in line I checked out the menu board and saw they had a lot going on, that I want to try it all, but I had to limit my choice to just one this time around.  Now they have breakfasts off the grill and breakfast sandwiches, so I knew the sandwiched sounded good, so I checked out the selection and went with the Ranchero on a jalapeno bagel and a large caramel latte. The Ranchero was egg, sausage, red onion & house made southwest cream cheese; it was a great breakfast bagel sandwich.  Happy to had found Nosh Cafe, and saw they do lunch and its less than 2 miles from my work, so I can pretty much say I will be back again soon.",

    "text": "After an extremely long wait in line to order, I ordered 5 bagels with cream cheese. All bagels we're different flavors, I did want 2 the same but they only had one so I ordered it, they toasted all 5 bagels. After 11min of our bagels sitting there waiting to have the cream cheese added and packed up I had to ask if would be much longer. They said they were working on it now, so 1 min later they handed me a bag, not a thank you, have a good day, no mention of sorry for the wait! I open the bag to check our order while I'm still at the counter and we only had 4 of our 5 bagels! Yup, the one that was the \"last one\" not in the bag! Obviously, I let them know that we are missing a bagel and 2 of the 4 we have are burnt (not the biggest deal). Well my bagel went missing and they have no idea how or why! So after 15min I'm pissed and I tell them take the bagels and refund my money! They really didn't care that they just lost a customer! I bet they will care when they realize that I love YELP and always give an honest review and give credit where credit is due! I wouldn't give them another chance if it was free! Back to The Bagel Man @ 5035 E ELLIOT RD, they have amazing bagels and good customer service!",

I see that a lot of the good reviews are of the bagels they serve. Hmmm. I didn't think you could screw up bagels. I do not see anything special about this place but it did seem that it catered to locals and wasn't touristy.",

She's short worded, unwelcoming, and flat out rude to customers.  If you want a real bagel with friendly service there is a much better place up the street on Elliot.  However, if you want an Einstein's copy with Darth Vader behind the counter, come to The Nosh.",

    "text": "Hello to all you foodies out there!  Been looking for a good Bagel place in the area, because as we all know, bagels are an essential part of life.  We know what the chain bagel places are all about....ok bagels and lousy cream cheese...so I am happy to say Bagel Nosh has some superior cream cheese.  Since this review is about finding a good bagel place, I guess we should start with the bagels.  There is a nice variety of bagels but alas....no egg bagel.  boooooooo  To me, the bagels are similar to the kind you buy in a grocery store bakery area...they are not dense(as I grew up with in Chicago or even New York) but almost fluffier, but they are still good.  So much for the bagels...let get to the cream cheese!    The cream cheese is creamy and thick but not too thick and very flavorful.  When enjoying their bagel and cream cheese sandwich it is safe to say it is the cream cheese that you notice.  I will continue to search for the type bagel I enjoy and in the meantime I will continue to enjoy Bagel Nosh.  I would also like to mention the service is great and the employees are wonderful and very friendly and that alone will bring me back!  Keep up the good work.  I think you should check this place out and in the meantime....  Bon Appetite'",

But I still left Bagel Nosh feeling like I wished I had gone to IHOP next door.  I ordered the $7 Arizona Classic: an egg sandwich with bacon and cheese on the bagel of my choice. The quality was pretty much on par with a McBagel McSandwich but was twice the price. The bacon was more like bacon bits and the egg was thin and tasteless. There was nothing wrong with the service, but the prices were way too high for what I was eating.  My friends had ordered a bagel with spread that looked better. So I guess the rule of thumb here would be to order a bagel only. I would definitely leave other breakfast food concoctions to another restaurant.",

Chicken salad bagel sandwich wasn't too bad at all, except for the nuts in it - I'd probably eat it again however.  Had a tomato basil bagel toasted with it... yum!

An example is their bagel and lox. You get a generous bagel with lots of salmon, which is obviously the only reason you'd ever order the lox. To contrast, at Einstein you get a tiny amount of salmon that, honestly, they should be completely embarrassed about serving. The bagels here are incredible too and they offer a nice selection of breakfast and lunch. Oh, and they have great coffee!!!",
