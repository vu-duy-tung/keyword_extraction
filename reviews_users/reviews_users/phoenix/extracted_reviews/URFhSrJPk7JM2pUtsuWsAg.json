The lack of delivery option is really the only bad thing I can say about China Chili. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, my order was ready exactly when I asked for it to be, everyone at the meeting loved their various dishes, serving sizes were generous (especially for lunch specials), and the prices were very reasonable.  I was advised by my staff in no uncertain terms that we should cater with China Chili again, and I would certainly return on my own.",

I'd pass on the cheese puffs, they had a bizarre flavor, that I still can't put my finger on.  The pot stickers were perfect.  I ordered the pepper beef and it was very good.  The red and green peppers were cooked just perfectly so they were not too soft or crisp and the beef was also done just right with the perfect amount of pepper sauce.  It came with white rice, which I'm not use to, since I usually have brown, but that was fine also.  Decor is fine, a little 60's china-ish but it seems to suit the place.  From the diverse crowd that was there last night enjoying themselves, it seems they agree with me.  This place is a hit.",

I've been going to China Chili since it's original location on Central and Osborn and followed it like many of its fans to its much larger location which accommodates all of its patrons.  I don't usually bother writing reviews for places that have over 50 reviews but after reading some of the reviews, I want to set things straight.  First of all, I've been to the Chinese Cultural Center and am not a fan whatsoever.  China Chili blows the Cultural Center out of the water.  The beauty of China Chili (and only you regulars know this), they will make everything made-to-order.  In other words, if you want white meat only, with just light sauce and medium spice, they will do it just like that and deliver it steaming hot to your table within 5 minutes.    The wait staff, if you get to know them, are extremely nice, kind and so sweet.  They may not be too chatty but don't take it personal.   So next time, if you want your Chinese food in a certain way, just ask.  They will give you exactly what you want.",

    "text": "Maybe I'm jaded from all the places I've traveled to and lived in, but I honestly didn't see the big deal about this restaurant.  True, their appetizers are decent and the Hot and Sour soup tasty.  But the main dishes we had -- Garlic Eggplant and a half duck -- both very highly recommended by other reviewers, were mediocre at best.  I suspect most Americans wouldn't know \"real\" Chinese if they saw it  and this restaurant perpetuates the myth, that what they serve is actual Chinese food  (after bringing a friend to a Chinese restaurant off of Northern (Wahsun), which makes real Chinese food, he was shocked to taste what real Chinese food is).  Most of the dishes at China Chili are overly salty and/or sweet  (to be fair though, as a diabetic, I usually avoid both, so I might be overly sensitive on that point).  The service is indeed excellent and friendly.  My biggest complaint was the party of 15 Latinos sitting next to us celebrating a birthday, who apparently think it's okay to have screaming children ruin everyone else's night.  But that's not the restaurant's fault, since machine gunning guests is (still) illegal and there was nothing they could do about it.  In summary, the food here is okay, with the appetizers being their strong suit.  I've tasted much better in the Valley and don't really think this place deserves all the hype it gets.  Then again, there ARE a lot worse Chinese restaurants out here, so this may be your best bet.  It doesn't hurt either, that they're open till 10pm; a remarkable exception in a city, where the norm is to close at 8pm or 9, even on weekends and which, of course, is ridiculous for a \"major\" city.  I truly recommend \"Wahsun\" in Phoenix, if you want to try real Chinese food.  I think most people would be surprised to discover how very different it is from what they're used to.  The food takes some getting used to, but once you get into it, you'll never go back to China Chili or their colleagues.",

It's a good good spot for transplanted East Coasters like me who like Chinese comfort food without an overgrease laden spoon. Love that they know how to pack mushu to go, no added instructions or confusion. Meat & seafood are always fresh, well cooked. Vegan dishes are just that, vegan. No muss, no fuss. The chef can make a dish to order if it's not available on the menu!!! We keep going back for: hot & sour, YuShang, Salt & Pepper, old standards. Their specials are great.  We always try a dash of anything different than what you can't get anywhere else and have not been disappointed yet. Overall very happy we found this gem in the desert!",

Perfectly chewy with a nice crisp on them. Wifey went with her go to dish, the amaaaaazing Singapore rice noodles with BBQ pork and Shrimp (8.95)  This dish is EASILY enough to feed three people. (yes, she brought most of it home) I went with the salt and pepper pork chops. If I could marry chinese food, this would be my bitch. Holy cow. Awesome thin cut pork chops breaded, salted and served with jalapenos and chives. I don't ever ever ever eat fried foods, but these were seriously one of the best chinese pork dishes ever. Overall, great great great. Super stoked that this place is right around the corner.",

All the servers seem to work together so there are no time gaps.   We looked over the menu and ordered a seafood soup, salty fish and chicken fried rice and Kung Pao seafood. The excellent seafood soup came first and fast. It was very tasty and was entirely consumed by the time our entrees showed up. The other two weren't bad but weren't great either. We ate our fill and took the remainder as carry out. Our server boxed and bagged it at the table. My opinions on the food are a matter of detail regarding fish not salty and squid overcooked...I've had both these dishes at other places and I'll stand with my opinion.  I think that with a few visits to identify  the cooks best talents, this  could be a fine neighborhood Chinese restaurant, worthy of regular patronage.",

The house lo mein and pepper calamari are both so addicting. Flavoring is great and not too greasy. We love that they poke ventilation holes into the fried items so they stay crispy.  Their soups however have been a little meh. Tried hot and sour and egg drop and neither really lived up to the rest of the menu. This is one of our favorite places!",

Coming from the Bay Area I have high standards for Asian food and this is so far my most favorite place to go. All the food has met and exceeded my expectations. Hot and sour is just right although I add extra vinegar and hot paste. Lol. Hunan beef is one of my favorite things to get even though it's not on the menu they make it for me. Eggplant is bomb and all the apps are yummy. I love the fact that you get refills on drinks too!! Prices are reasonable decor is ok but those things are secondary for me. Big seating area and prompt service with parking close to downtown keeps me coming back! You won't be disappointed I know I haven't!",

The soup wasn't anything special, but is you order chicken they almost give you the whole chicken! It was more like a whole breast cut up into pieces as opposed to individual pieces breaded and fried and whatnot, so it is obviously more healthy... They give you a TON of food and the price is good.

We ordered the shrimp fried rice, the moo shoo vegetable, the spicy eggplant, crab puffs, spring rolls, orange chicken, vegetable egg-foo young, and a couple of other things that were great. Their food was delicious. One of the best Chinese restaurants in the valley, for sure. Their crab puffs and moo shoo vegtable stood out to me. My dad loved the orange chicken and said that in his 72 years of life, it was the best orange chicken he has ever had.  I recommend this place. They have great lunch specials, as well. The service is amazing and the women are very attentive. Our drinks were always full.  We will definitely be back many times.",

Longer: Been going here for years and when I worked nearby I would go frequently at lunch. Their lunch specials are great and comes with soup and a vegetable egg roll. The only problem is that it's maybe a dollar or two too expensive for the type of chinese food it is. It's nothing fancy, just good solid Chinese food. The place is pretty big but is always packed when I go.   I personally get the House Special Chicken. Other good items depending on your mood:  Appertizers: Veggie Egg Rolls, West Lake Soup  Seafood: Almond and Cashew Nut Prawns  Chicken: Besides the House Special Chicken, Chicken in Black Bean Sauce  Pork: Sweet and Sour Pork  Also, I get the fried rice which is an extra $1 at lunch.  Service is super fast especially at lunch, otherwise, typical Asian service, not very personable and even if they were, it may be difficult to understand so maybe it's better to save for the awkward conversation anyways. Also, I'm not one for overly friendly (fake) service anyways, so it's not necessarily a bad thing.",

I was only given the lunch special menu, and they brought my soup (hot & sour) no kidding within  2 minutes of placing my order.  The soup was great, I was only half way through when my entree arrived, I ordered sweet and sour chicken.  The serving was large, easily enough for 2 meals.  It was ok, nothing to get excited about but....what I didn't like is the pieces are huge, like a breast cut in 4 very long strands.  I could not get a knife, so it was hard to eat the chicken, it wasn't tough meat but it didn't cut well with a fork.  I didn't like my leftovers enough to take them with me.  They are really fast so if you're in a hurry at lunch it's worth I try.  I'll probably try them a couple more times and would like to view the full menu.    If you dig hot and sour soup, you should definitely try theirs.  Nom!!!",

Chewy flavorless pork and little rice rocks were in abundance. It really had no flavor at all. It is hard to mess up this dish, but somehow, they did.   Sweet and sour chicken. When you open the container and the veg is burnt, we have a problem. Hard over battered and over fried pieces of dry chicken were placed strategicly throughout the box. The sauce... well its sauce alright. Ketchup based. Thick. Gooey. Snot like sauce.  Lemon chicken was ok. Not great, but not bad either. Good bits of chicken. Ok flavor. Sauce was so so. Overall the best of the 3.  Recommendations... go to Mu Shu instead. See the owner there. His name is Gary, he will give you real food. Eat it and be happy.

For $10 (and that's with a soft drink) the lunch special portions are huge (like enough to get a box and take home leftovers, huge!) and the Mongolian beef  is an option.   Service is wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am but that works for a weekday lunch at a place that's 6 miles from the office.  Enjoyed dinner here with the family a few weeks back and service had a much more enjoyable pace.  Food has been consistently tasty. I like the batter they use for items like the lemon and orange chicken, etc. and the meat quality is good (i.e. all white meat chicken).

The service was poor and neglectful, it was during lunch but the place was not full and we had a time line to keep being on lunch ourselves. We were seated promptly and drink order taken, when returning with drinks placed them down and quickly left without a word. Sat for 10 minutes and flagged someone for an order. Soup for the lunch specials came out after the food, wasn't good. The Mongolian Beef I ordered was a plate of onions with approx 2 oz of beef. My boyfriend ordered House Special Chicken which has always been at every restaurant I have ever been to a crispy chicken in a brown broth heavy on ginger, onion and garlic...not here. I don't know what it was but it was awful. Corn starch thickened red sauce that was sour and spicy, blunt flavor without dimension and honestly inedible. We sat for some time trying to get attention of anyone to get a bill, was ignored. Finally got a bill and the person dropped it and left never to return or point us to the bar which is where you pay but never having been there and not being directed we didn't know. I am a skilled home cook and I make better than this on a Tuesday night, for $17.89 I could have actually eaten my food at home instead of leaving 2 full plates behind.",

On Saturday March 15th, my wife and I had dishes we'd loved before, such as chicken with sizzling rice soup and chicken in birds nest (chicken with vegetables with a potato chip like basket).  Within hours, I suffered severe symptoms of food poisoning. Without a day my wife did as well. For the next month, I continued to suffer severe gastrointestinal problems, and remain under a doctor's care. My wife was OK after a couple of days, but this was a nightmare.  This is direct cause and effect. I've never had such severe problems before, and this was the only meal where my wife and I had the same dishes.  I complained to the Maricopa County restaurant examiners, but they weren't interested unless others complained as well. Meantime there is no way I would ever return. I don't need the aggravation.",

I ordered the same dishes that I had two days ago (stir-fried noodles and dumplings) because I seriously wanted to compare the food.    My reaction: It was pretty good.    In comparison to the food from couple of days ago, this could have been labelled as being great.    However, considering that I spent my teenage years working at an awesome Chinese restaurant to pay for my SUV that I rolled off the interstate, I cannot say that this was the best Chinese food that I have ever had.   I'm also a bit of a snob when the dish contains any type of noodles. The noodles I got yesterday were too overcooked and drowned in oil.  It had a good balance of flavor, but again, I don't want to be drinking vegetable oil by spoonfuls either, you know?  The meat and the seafood were in good size and cooked well, so kudos for that.    I would go back to try some different dishes, but the overall content of the menu seemed quite general to me.   I'm still on the hunt for the best semi-Americanized-Chinese restaurant in the valley yet again this week.",

(Unfortunately I could not remember the name of the soup--thank goodness the table behind me was eating it and I was able to point it out the waitress) The wonton soup came with 8 large wontons, broccoli, chicken, green onions, and other Chinese vegetables in a savory white broth. The soup came out in a large bowl and was piping hot--almost burned my tongue a couple of times, but it was worth it as it was very flavorful and not too salty.The soup with tax came to $8, which was a surprise as I thought that it would be more for the size. I would definitely come back here for lunch as the price you pay for the amount of food that you get and the quality is great. The only negatives was the service (the waiters stood around not too far from our table looking extremely bored) and the chicken corn chowder soup, which was bland and left a lot to be desired. I only ate it because I was very hungry and had to wait 15 minutes for my friend to show up (smile)",

It has been a long time since I last visited China Chile.  I realized China Chile receives many positive reviews but to be honest, it just wasn't good, in my opinion. Maybe I caught them on an off day.  The service is very rushed at China Chile.  We barely sat down and glanced over the menu when the waitress came over, very ready to jot down our order. So we choose our entrees, Orange Chicken, and refreshments.  Pior to our entrees we were given a complimentary bowl of sweet and sour soup, however I just didn't like the taste. The portion sizes at China Chile are large, but the taste of the of the orange chicken was too sweet, salty, and the liberal usage of corn starch everywhere, made for an unpleasant taste and  both our dishes were smothered in sweet & sour sauce, the entrees just weren't good.  Having tried China Chile on several occasions, I have always been disappointed.",

I got the order to go, and they didn't cut vents in the lid, so when I arrived home and opened it, the chicken nuggets were soggy. Overall, very disappointing meal for $10.   And recently I tried the tomato chicken. I didn't like that either. Way too much tomato sauce, barely any chicken. The sauce has got a very sweet taste, with onions and hints of ginger.   I've now tried most of the menu, and the lemon chicken and tomato chicken are by far the worst. Avoid. Most of the rest of the menu is ok to good.",

Ordered the kung pao chicken, a standard dish for most Chinese joints, so generally a safe bet. The egg drop soup was bland so I didn't finish it. The KPC was generously piled high on the plate, but sadly, it was tasteless. It's like they added a bit of soy sauce with some Sriracha and forgot the kung pao sauce completely. Didn't even finish half the dish as eating tasteless chicken is disappointing. If they can't make a better KPC than Panda Express, there is no use wasting any further time or money here. NEXT!",

She had already brought the horrible hot n sour soup that comes with the lunch special...it would of been fine if it actually had a good flavor. I ordered sizzling rice soup, which I've had at other places for over 30 yrs it was missing a lot! It had only a few sad pieces of chicken floating in a tasteless broth.  Very disappointing. My friend got the seafood blossom soup...it was missing the medley of seafood...had lots of tofu and two shrimp...over all pour experience.",

Gets 1 star for ambiance, 1 more star because it's an actual restaurant with servers. And the third star is for their menu of choices and some of the items we ordered were pretty good. But why not 4 or even 5 stars... Well..I ordered their house chicken with fried rice. Looked great but no flavor. My daughter ordered Orange chicken, looked exactly the same as my dish but the sauce had a hint of orange..which was not bad but not impressed. Mom had Mongolian beef..tasty but nothing to scream off the top of a mountain. Which is what I was hoping for...from at least one dish. On the other hand their pot stickers was the only and one thing I would go back for, handmade, hearty and flavorful. Also, the server highly recommended the salt and pork dish for us to take home to my Dad...let's just say it went back in the box and has been in the fridge for a while..sorry.",

China Chili gets ordered regularly  in my office and every time I take a taste I am disappointed. Their fried rice is terrible. Not a single veggie or egg piece to be found. Chicken is rubbery and the sauces always tastes a little off.",

I spent $46 for two people and expected far better.  I ordered the Lover's Prawns which were 17.95 and comes in two separate boxes.  In the chili prawn box, there were three or four shrimp at the top, and an entire sliced up tomato on the bottom, I guess just to give it weight.  The vegetables seemed old, and both sauces were flavorless.  \"Chef's Specialty\" my ass. Surprised they don't call it \"Lover's Prawn\" and give you one shrimp total.  I don't know how this place gets rave reviews, because the food is incredibly expensive and mediocre at best.  Also, they go out of their way to short you on takeout.  Maybe it's different if you dine in.  Either way, will not be returning ever.",

    "text": "I haven't had much here, as I live in North Scottsdale. My sister lives a few minutes away, however, and I had the pleasure of having the food here for Christmas dinner. The first time I ate here, I ordered the orange chicken, and I was unimpressed. I'm guessing that flavor depends slightly on which cook they have on. On Christmas, they couldn't answer the phones, as they were packed, so my brother-in-law just went over to order the food. He took a picture of the restaurant, and it looked more like a packed music venue than a restaurant. I think that's the first sign of a good restaurant-locals who regularly visit. The following dishes were great: Beef with Snow Peas, Orange Chicken, and Hunan Tofu. The Sichuan Prawns, however, were absolutely amazing. I would gladly drive the 20 minutes or so there and back for this dish alone. My sister and my brother-in-law order the orange chicken regularly, but my order on  Christmas converted her to the Prawns. Unfortunately, he has the palate of a 3 year old picky eater and doesn't eat seafood, so she can only have them on occasion.  There was a write-up on the prawns in Phoenix magazine within the last 6 months or so that made the writer sound like a complete idiot who likes to talk about nothing at all and has no way of actually discerning different flavors in a dish, but the one thing I would agree with him or her is that the Prawns are excellent. My name is Stirling Peters.",

The potstickers were perfectly cooked, steamed with a little bit of crunch. They were truly the best I've had and they were filling too. The chow mein was flavorful and the orange chicken was perfect. It had just enough breading to make it crunchy and had quality chicken. Note, you can get the orange chicken at different spice levels (mild, medium, and spicy). We went for the mild and it was perfect. Can't wait to go back and try more dishes!",

I don't recall my glass ever getting halfway empty.  We order the Egg Rolls and Crab Cheese Puffs, for appetizers, the eggrolls were different a little small in size but very yummy. The Crab Ragoons were better, filled with cream cheese a little crab and green onion...gave them a good taste.   For dinner we opted for the Honey Walnut Shrimp, Orange Chicken and Pillow Chicken. We were a little disappointed that we could only get white rice. To get fried rice we would have to order it as an entree. The Honey Walnut Shrimp was really good, nice size Shrimp with tails removed.  The Orange Chicken was different than normal orange chicken - it reminded me of a buffalo chicken with a sweet kick to it. The Pillow Chicken was something I never had before and personally I did not like it. It reminded me of a crab cake or salmon patty...two things that I do not like; it is a texture issue not a taste issue.   The staff was willing to box everything up with extra steamed rice. We even order a chicken fried rice and Mu Shu Beef to go, which proved to be very yummy leftovers.",

We walked in and was quickly greeted and seated.  3 seconds go by and a serve shows up ready to take our drink order.  She came back in like 30 seconds with the drinks.  And asked for our food order.  We were not ready and asked for a few mins.  She looked away from us and walked away.  She did not seem happy we were not ready.  =(  We quickly scanned the lunch menu and made our choices.  She was back in 3 mins. We ordered and she was happily on her way.  =)    I got the house special chicken, I asked for not spicy (SORRY, I am a whimp).  It was tender white meat lightly battered & fried then covered in special garlic sauce and served with a egg roll.  It was a nice garlic sauce (not too garlicy to kill all your coworkers but just a good amount).  The chicken was completed cooked, tender, and juicy.  But before all that we got chicken corn soup, not bad at all.  Food was not too shabby!  Overall it was a quick lunch and taste good.  I am a full and happy camper.  Now back to work!!!",

    "text": "We went this past Saturday with my sister-in-law and her husband.  She works in the area and suggested we go to dinner here.   I was extremely pleased with our meal.  We started with Egg Rolls, Pot Stickers and Boiled Won Tons.  The egg rolls were crispy and flavorful, the pot stickers were plump and the filling was delish, but the star for me was the boiled won tons.  I have never had anything like them, They were packed full of meat and served in this savory peanut flavored broth. My sister-in-law was a little wary of trying one, but she did and concurred that they were quite good.  She is not the most adventurous eater so that is really saying something!  For our main courses we  shared Mongolian Beef, Peking Shrimp, Salt and Pepper Shrimp, and Sichuan Beef.  The Mongolian Beef was tender and seasoned perfectly, The Peking Shrimp had a spicy red sauce the had a little tang to is and was served with snow peas (nice and crunchy not over cooked) and onions.  The salt and pepper shrimp were fried with a nice light batter that was salty but not over done and the jalapeno peppers were just right.  The Sichuan  Beef was my least favorite, I thought the sauce made the batter a little soggy but I really liked that sauce so was still a good dish.  The portions are huge, I was full after the appetizers as were my dinner companions, so we took a lot of our dinner home, and it tasted great the next day.  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive.  I especially appreciated that she boxed up our leftovers instead of just dropping off some boxes at the table.  From the outside the restaurant doesn't really look like much, a sand colored stucco building, but inside it is furnished and decorated nicely, the tables are spaced  so that you don't feel crowded and the lighting was bright but not overly so.  My only complaint would be that their tofu dishes had meat in them so there weren't as many vegetarian options as I would have like to have seen.  I didn't get a chance to ask if they can adjust them for vegetarians, but will the next time I go and before I take any of my veggie buddies there.",

Next evening we decided to try their take out. I ordered sweet & sour chicken with the sauce on the side. After picking up my order and beginning the drive home, I realized that the onions, green peppers and pineapple was missing from the chicken container. I went back to the restaurant and was told that the veggies were in the sauce (because I ordered the sauce on the side) to keep them crispy.  I said \"great\" and left.  When I got home, I opened my container of sweet & sour sauce and found 1 bite size piece of pineapple, 1 bite size piece of onion and 1 bite size piece of bell pepper!!  Won't be back...",

Lunch includes soup a spring roll and white rice. lunches range from 6.95-8.95 plus drink. $1 more for fried rice or brown which seems a bit steep to me.  I had the ma po to fu. To fu in a \"spicy\" sauce with a few veggies. They oped to use a soft tofu making this into almost a soup like dish, firmer is almost allays better with tofu. I asked for mine very spicy and I still had to add allot of chili paste.  What I don't get is the interior decorations. It seems to be a mix of pseudo 80's night club meets china.   It is nice that you can get your own bill making paying or a large work lunch a breeze  If only the food were better.",

Lunch hours are packed, best right after 1pm.  Dinners are also popular here with weekends being a time for a full house. Like most restaurants this place has some not to be missed dishes. The boiled wanton soup is so good! You must try the boiled wanton and its spicy, peanut goodness! This is great shared before your meal. The Honey Walnut Prawns here are amongst the best I've ever had. The orange chicken is overly fried, pick around the fried chicken and enjoy a mildly spicy orange sauce. The Mongolian Beef is also a favorite. The restaurant does use an abundant amount of onion scallions, I often ask to omit them. The staff here is generally very attentive and you can customize your dishes. Definitely worth a visit!",

They make it to order & allow personal specifications (i.e. no bean sprouts) That's awesome!!  The first time I ate there, I had some egg drop soup which was a little different because they put diced tomato in it. Wasn't too keen on that, but it was ok otherwise. My fiance had the Orange Chicken but said he didn't really enjoy the chicken. We ended up packing both of these and donating to someone who looked hungry. It wasnt terrible, just wasnt our taste.  I also ordered the crab cheese puffs last time. Ordering them again this time because they were soo yummy!! I'm so excited to eat dinner here again =)",

They are super friendly and prices are reasonable for the amount of food. Our go-to order includes Mongolian chicken, which is filled with yummy veggies, as well as chicken, and has a great sauce. Spicy Sichuan Prawns are delicious. All of their fried rice options are great and HUGE portions, but we love the amount of veggies in the vegetable fried rice.

    "text": "Seriously, people giving this place high reviews? When we went here last, the chicken was dry and had a burnt coating that slid right off. And it was somewhat temperate in the middle, confirming my suspicion that this was made earlier and then just re-fried, cut, and served. I don't think any restaurant should get any stars when they just open a can or packet (yes, I'm talking about the vegetables and sauces) and mix with pre-cooked meat. That IS NOT good Chinese food. As someone who has lived where there are actual Chinatowns (Boston and San Francisco), I know what very good Chinese food is, and this place certainly is not.  Oh, and the lighting. Who said that bright, overhead lighting creates a pleasant atmosphere for dining?   I have yet to find a Chinese restaurant here in the Phoenix area that actually puts together fresh ingredients from scratch. If anyone knows of one, please let me know.",

Now, I only eat here if it is catered at work and even then if I haven't brought my lunch into the office.  The vegetables are always overcooked, mushy and taste oily.  The chicken is always over done.  The beef is gristly and flavorless.  The sauces on the food, and the ones on the side, are gloppy and thick, often oily and often flavorless.  The egg rolls are small and greasy, maybe they need to drain them more before serving?   The good parts:  I don't pay for the lunch when it is catered at work, but like I said...I still only eat this if I didn't bring my own lunch for some reason and the fortune cookies!",

The Lunch Specials Menu offers a variety of mild and spicy dishes reasonably priced. I prefer the spicy dishes that are characterized by the restaurant's namesake. My normal selections are the \"Spicy\" Kung Pao Shrimp or Kung Pao Chicken which come with an egg roll, steamed Jasmine white rice and a complimentary cup of the Soup of the Day. I am always amazed by the efficiency of the restaurant staff. The meals are served fresh and at lightning speed. I highly recommend this eatery if you are looking for a quick and delicious meal!",

Don't worry, no such behavior will be necessary here. All the servers are speedy and attentive. Expect to order drinks within seconds of sitting down and food arrives faster than McDonald's.   One of the cleanest and largest Asian restaurants I've seen. They have family sized tables with a huge turntable in the middle.   Lunches are large enough to share and dinner is family style.  The shrimp dishes are particularly exceptional, large and always de-veined. Try the \"prawns with vegetables\" or \"honey walnut prawns.\"   Sizzling black pepper beef is great too.",

I was on my way back to the West Valley, from the East Valley, and did a search on my beloved Yelp for a highly rated Chinese Food joint that was on the way. China Chili kept appearing. We called in the take out order, and it was finished before I arrived.   We ordered the House Chicken, Spicy Garlic Eggplant, Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Fried Shrimp. And... BAM! It was bomb!  The House Chicken was delicious. Garlic-y, with little bit of spicyness to it, and a very subtle nuttyness to it from the oil in the wok. Great texture, great smell... It was fantastic.  I'm not an Eggplant fan, but my gf is, and she ordered it. She said the Eggplant was a 3.5. Good, but not the best she'd ever had.     The Kung Pao... Again, a very good dish. If there was a complaint, it was that it was a tad heavy on the zucchini in the dish, which was just a tad overcooked. It changed the texture in the dish in an obvious way.  Mongolian Beef. NOM NOM! Perfect. Great flavor, great texture. Very happy with the dish.   The Breaded Shrimp was perfect. I can only handle so much fried shrimp. Tried one, and it was spot on.   This was a perfect way to end a 15 hour day.",

Our Orange Chicken had very little heat and although it was listed as lightly battered and fried ours had no batter on it at all and appeared to have been sauted instead.

I think one of the biggest things to consider is how many different styles of Asian cuisine there are. Maybe I just don't like this type of Chinese food?? The dishes I have tried have varied anywhere from their house special chicken to the their Mongolian beef and their deep fried prawns. Every dish I have had from here have been made with good quality ingredients and have been prepared nicely but to me the flavor just isn't there. My fiancee really likes their food however, which is the reason I've eaten it on several different occasions. If I do order from here, I typically get the Pillow Chicken which is good and had a really interesting (in a good way) texture. I love a good hot and sour soup, and again their soup just doesn't quite do it for me for some reason. The service here has always been good, take out has been fast and efficient, and the lot is seemingly always packed. So on this one, I'll just chalk it up to personal taste, which is just a confirmation that everyone is different - which is fine with me.",

I usually go for the orange chicken and the beef chow mein. I love how their orange chicken are sliced fried cutlets, I've never had it this way until now and I love it a lot more than the other places who make their orange chicken 90% breading and 10% chicken. I still haven't gotten around to taking my friends here yet, but whenever my boyfriend and I are craving Chinese food we always come here.",

They are neither not nor spicy, just reeeeeally tasty).  Best meal!!",

I love the fact that they also do catering, and I was able to cater a big party and they made accommodations to substitute two dishes that were not on their catering menu. It was a huge hit, and everyone loved it. I've also ordered takeout a few times now from them, and I've been satisfied every time. Their portions are pretty large. One dish plus a box of rice will last me three meals! Although the taste here is a little Americanized, I do like their chicken with black bean sauce. That is usually my go-to. The vegetables are very fresh, and the meats are always cooked well. When I order ahead for takeout, they have the food ready in about ten minutes. Even for catering, I think I only had to put in the order a day or two ahead. The staff here are usually pretty friendly too.",

    "text": "We were driving around & decided to Yelp nearby restaurants. China Chili popped up in the list & had received good reviews, so we decided to stop by. The parking spaces in front & behind the restaurant are limited & when we got there, there were no spots open so we had to park on the street. When we walked in, we noticed the restaurant was much larger than it appeared from the outside & was pretty busy - a good first sign.  We were promptly seated & brought our drinks. We ordered the Fried Golden Prawns for an appetizer and the Chicken in Phoenix Nest & Sesame Chicken for our meal. The prawns were good but nothing special. There were sweet & sour and horseradish sauces on the table which were the only reason that the prawns had any taste. As for our meal, the Chicken in Phoenix Nest was in an interesting tasting sauce - the first couple of bites were good but left a weird after taste. I only ate 3 or 4 bites. The Sesame Chicken was the same way. I understand that it's a different preparation than the sweet American version but this plate just had a bunch of slices of fried chicken with a gravy tasting sauce poured on top. I only ended up eating about 4 or 5 bites of this as well & was done.  Additionally, one of the things we noticed was that our waiter was really nice. We had a few questions about the menu & he was more than happy and nice, answered everything. Some of the ladies who were waitresses there, however, were not friendly. They glared at people when walking around picking up plates & dropping off meals. It was a little un-comforting / intimidating to get these looks while eating. Overall, due to the taste of the food & experience, we probably will not be back.",

I think that the Orange Chicken is possibly their best item right now but sadly did not have it.  Thought I would explore to other dishes but never again.  Not sure I will be back, possibly for lunch for the Orange Chicken. With so many other choices of Asian Food.. this local favorite has not kept up its quality.",

It has been a staple for us going back 15 years to their location on Central. We have visitors from SF, Vancouver, NY, LA who are consistently amazed to find Chinese food of this quality in Phoenix. Even if they are the best of Phoenix on a good day, they are not rivals for the 5 stars in those towns though.  Here's a few tips for getting the most out of China Chile. Don't do take out. Always get a soup, hot n sour is our favorite. Chicken Salad is special. They never miss on spring rolls and pot stickers. Honey walnut prawns get my luv one Jonesing to go there. Orange chicken and orange beef have not disappointed. Noodles have. Chow fun or chow mein should be on your order. They do shell fish superbly, especially scallops. Whole fish is a mixed bag some great, some not so. The pork chops and chashu are a bit dry for my taste. Special menus on the whole have been disappointing. It's boom or bust, but if they offer seared beef tenderloin take the risk. One night I'm raving to fiends about how good it is, at the same time a guy at an adjacent table is complaining to the manager about the very same dish. That's China Chile.",

Around lunchtime, the frenetic staff buzz about delivering drinks and soups and entrees and checks. You don't really have a waiter as much as you have a zone defense! The lunch menu is consistently good. The service is very, very fast. Considering the large portions, the price is very good.  For dinner, the place is calm and quiet and very pleasant. And the dinner menu is enormous. You could probably eat dinner at China Chili every night for 100 days and not have the same dish twice.  Great for takeout, too!  Some tips: -If you like Orange Chicken, you will absolutely love the way they prepare it at China Chili. Instead of small, battered chunks of mediocre chicken, they batter a whole juicy chicken breast and then serve that sliced and drowning in the orange sauce. I order this dish about 2/3s of the time. -The Salt and Pepper Beef is very good. -Chicken Corn Soup might be my favorite soup ever.  Anyway, now I'm hungry for Chinese food. Time to make a China Chili run!",

My friends and I laugh that the staff is almost clairvoyant, because your food will arrive just about the second you finish ordering it.  I particularly like the Orange Chicken, because the sauce and the breading seem very home-made, not processed.   The only downside to its popularity and speed of service is there can be a wait for seating during the lunch hour.",

Undaring dishes with expected flavors delivered witha reasonable price. Now, mind you there is a hell-a-handsome tattooed waiter, who while I'm waiting for my to go food, I do the blue steel, eye lash flicker while I'm puckering up my lips look. While I'm sure I think I look hot and flirty, he and the rest of the staff are hurling up the mid afternoon dim sum. I'm just saying so often the famous favorite that's been around forever can be stale and uninventive. But on a Sunday, the pork lo mein, crab puffs and broccoli and beef nicely soak up the cosmo overdose I suffered at the hands of the previous night bartender who overserved me. The nerve.

    "text": "There is an inherent dilemma that affects all ethnic cuisine in this country. That dilemma is: How authentic are we going to make this restaurant? Basically, this question is answered by looking at the bottom line. If you are in an area with a relatively low conentration of that ethnicity then in order for your business to stay alive, you need to cater to the tastes of the local majority. The beauty of China Chili is that they walk this line and do it successfully. Restaurants that lean towards authenticity typically tend to alienate the majority of people because its simply intimidating. On the other side, a restaurant that caters to American tastes is hated on for the watered down ethnic experience. What China Chili has managed to do is make Chinese food accessible to the demographic around them. The Asian population in the Phoenix metro area is concentrated in the East Valley and Northwest Valley. There are very few Chinese downtown and that is shown by the lack of Chinese restaurants in the downtown area. China Chili has understood this and has beautifully adapted their menu to reflect the area they are in. In response to the people who commented on the lack of authenticity of the food here, I would say that I agree with that in part. However, being Chinese, I know that if you go into any Chinese restaurant that has Chinese people working there and you ask them, you'll find that there are additional items that the kitchen can make for people who are looking for that authentic experience. China Chili is no different. Just ask for something more authentic and in most cases they can tell you what they have available. I can tell you from first hand experience that they have ALL Chinese cooks in the kitchen. Its not like they don't know how to make authentic Chinese food, but like any good restaurant, they know their audience.   Now to the food. Most of the things on the menu are pretty tasty. One thing that they do that most other places don't is tailor the food to your exact specifications. They can make it spicy, or less spicy, or omit veggies, msg, meat, or add basically anything you want. Some favorites of mines are the House Special Chicken, Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, Chicken Corn Chowder, and Spicy Garlic Eggplant. During lunch, they serve hearty lunch specials that after make you wish you were going to nap time rather than work(to some that may be synonymous). They have even more dishes that they can make for lunch specials than the ones they have listed so make sure you ask.   As for the decor....lets be honest. Chinese decor is tacky. I'm Chinese, I admit it. If the decor of a restaurant causes you to not eat there, then sadly you have probably missed the most amazing meals of your life because some of the biggest holes create some of the tastiest food. Its not dirty or messy, its just tacky, so please get over it. The Chinese are prone to gaudy, extravagant presentations, or did you miss the opening ceremonies of the Olympics?  In any case, I love China Chili because it allows people who would never walk into a more authentic Chinese restaurant to put a foot in the door of an enormous culinary world. And at China Chili they can venture in as far as they would want. .",

I have been craving that food since I got off the plane to move back to Phoenix. Well, I found China Chili and I am SO glad I did! The Honey Walnut Prawns are so  yummy! The fried rice and lo-mein noodles are smoky tasting, and hot out of the wok. Is it healthy? Maybe not. Is it non-greasy? Um... not really. Is it delicious when you're craving some really filling Chinese food? Yes. I wish it were closer to my place so I could have it more often, but I'm sure I'm sparing my waistline of more issues!",

I ordered the House Chow Mien which was ready just as I walked through the door. I could feel my food still sizzling through the Styrofoam to-go container. I couldn't get home fast enough and the smell from the back seat was so tempting I was close to pulling off to the side of the road and diving in. So I get home rip open the plastic bag to find my noddles steaming and filled with shrimp, pork, chicken, and scallions. This was one delicious meal (way better than Pei Wei) and the portion was huge for just under $9 bucks. I stuffed my face crazy and sill have enough for left overs or until I get hungry again in the next hour or so.",

It was a hot, spicy and a wonderful blend of spices including garlic and chilies. Most of the items on the lunch menu were labeled 'spicy', and so hopefully the others are this good too. By the look of the other diners, the smiles seemed to indicate good stuff. The service was efficient and fast, too. Highly recommended.",

You know it has to smell good when it is after lunch and he is trying to talk me into stopping in for a \"small bite.\" Yeah right! Well, when we looked at their menu last night, it wasn't cutting our tastes and decided to go for China Chili instead.  I've tried this place before and it was so-so but I believe in second chances. Thank goodness for second chances. We ordered this curry rice noodle dish mixed with chicken and shrimp. That was my favorite part and reminded of the Hamun noodle dish we used to get at the now-defunct Big Wong's. The dish was $9 and was enough for 3 adults. We also had the BBQ beef app ($5) and the egg rolls ($2). I wasn't too much a fan of the egg rolls but everything else was great in my book. Total with a couple bucks tip was $20. I wonder how soon I can talk the husband into going back. Maybe right after our next lunch for a mid-afternoon snack...",

It was like KFC and gravy with green onions. The sweet and sour chicken, sweet and sour pork as well as the fried rice, egg rolls and crab puffs - all unremarkable as well. The service is over-efficient to the point of annoyance, and like all Chinese joints, even the younger workers seem to go out of their way to be phonetically incomprehensible.

We have never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated without a reservation during crowded lunch times. The restaurant decor is spacious and inviting reflective of Chinese art/culture;  Two of my favorite dishes include: The Orange Chicken :  generous breastmeat  not overly breaded with the right amount of heat. Delicious. Spicy Green Beans with Tofu is another excellent dish with green beans not over-cooked and flavorful braised tofu that absobs the garlicky sauce.  I am not a huge fan of Chinese food, prefering instead Thai, Vietnamese and Japanese  cuisine which, for me, has more interesting ingredients.  But CC rates far above the other chinese restaurants I  have tried.  .",

And it's needed, the restaurant was super busy this Friday night.  Price - Excellent price points. You get plenty of food without breaking the bank.  I ordered a carry out of the house chicken and the house fried rice. I paid $20.  The portions were large. We had enough for two and have plenty left over. The sauce on the chicken is yummy goodness. That thing was made with love! It's garlicky without the strong aftertaste. The chicken was fresh and tender. It was well sauced yet the batter was still crispy. The house fried rice is very good. The rice, cooked well. It is served with chicken, shrimp and beef.  I usually enjoy quaint romantic restaurants, so I don't know if I'd ever dine in. The dining room and kitchen are pretty wide open and bright. No where to have a quiet convo.  China Chili is added to my list of favs while here in Phoenix.",

Walking through the 100+ degree weather to get some Chinese food didn't deter me, although I was drenched by the time I got there. Inside it looks like your usual Chinese dine-in place with the low lighting, cheap leather seats and rather large round tables. I was promptly greeted and my order taken, I got fried rice, prawns, soup, orange chicken, etc. All of which was surprisingly cheap and after a 15 minute wait decent sized portions.  When I got home even though the food has gotten cold it was still great! I can only imagine what it would be like fresh. Everything was flavorful and cooked to perfection. My family thoroughly enjoyed things over the next couple of days.   Overall, great food, good atmosphere, friendly staff. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'll make sure to stop by here.",

Here are some of the dishes we ordered: - Beef Chow Fun: one of the best Beef Chow Fun that I've tried (that's saying a lot!); noodles were just the right texture- cooked perfectly. There was a good amount of beef. - Beef w/ Black Pepper Sauce: authentic sauce paired with subpar beef slices (typically the dish features beef cubes) - Szechuan Shrimp: has been crispy during past visits but was a little soggy this time; kind of unexpected when you bite into it because there's breading but also minced shrimp & whole shrimp mixed togther - Sweet & Sour Pork: decent dish w/ slightly oily sauce - Pillow Tofu: frankly, a bit of a mess. The breading was too thick & tofu too concentrated/starchy.",

However, with this being said. When we were up visiting in Phoenix we excitedly decided to give it a try. We had the luncheon specials which are daily until 3.00 PM. with lots of choices.  You get egg flower soup, egg roll and your main entree which had a large array of choices.  The soup was \"meh\" to say the least.  The egg roll was a mini size but was OK.  I ordered the House Special Chicken  lightly battered in a spicy garlic sauce and that was pretty tasty. Hubby had the Sweet and Sour Prawns which was also pretty tasty.  The portions are enormous.  The restaurant is very large and tastefully decorated.  The service was OK.  The menu is extensive off the luncheon menu.  Lots of dishes.  Huge seafood, tofu, seafood, soup, duck, chicken and pork and beef specialties in the regular dinner menu..  This review is mainly from the luncheon menu.  I live in Tucson so the prices are just a bit higher in Phoenix.  All and all worth the try if you are in this area.",

I don't understand the stellar reviews of this place...maybe they save the good Chinese food for the dinner service?  Our lunch was just so so and that's being kind.  I ordered the 'special chicken' which was supposed to be spicy.  I ordered it medium and it had NO spice at all...very bland...certainly nothing special.  One friend had the lemon chicken...bland..so so.  The same with the Kung Pow chicken the other three ordered.!  BLAH!   One friend was a few minutes later than the other four of us, and the server acted like she was just sooo inconvenienced that we couldn't order right away. When we did order, the food came out within 5 minutes!  We couldn't believe it!  It had to be precooked and warmed up...that's what it tasted like.  I would never go to this place again.  There are too many good choices these days.",

We're talking $5-$6 a plate which includes the entree, rice and a cup of soup.  Can't get better than that.  Their service during lunch is amazingly fast.  That way if you only have an hour for lunch, you're in and out with time to spare.   My most recent review is when 14 of my friends and I went to China Chili for dinner.  We actually planned on going to Gallo Blanco but it was almost a 2 hour wait to accommodate our party.  So off to China Chili we went and there was no wait to boot!  We ordered the peking duck, mongolian beef, house chow mein, fried rice, walnut shrimp, peking pork chops, crispy noodles, ma po tofu...and really, that's all I can remember.  Some of the guys also had beers and sake.  I can't think of one dish that I did not like.  This place does NOT disappoint.  After stuffing our faces, we were delighted that our bill, plus tax and gratuity ended up being $10 a person.  What a deal!!!  I am a huge fan of China Chili!",

It's the best mom and pop Chinese restaurant I've ever been to.  I'm a strict vegetarian, and China Chili has been very accommodating. I'd recommend the Hunan Style Tofu with no chicken.   I'm not a big holiday person, so I'm looking forward to spending Thanksgiving and Christmas here.",

When we asked to be seated at a round table for four instead of a small square one--- NO was the abrupt response and no explanations.  Very rude!  Also, there were only 4 groups of people there.  Not even half filled to capacity on a Thursday night around 4 pm.  Ordered the Mongolian beef And orange chicken. The orange chicken was disgusting and very sweet. Also the chicken was very dry and over fried where it was hard and tough.  Panda Express makes a better orange chicken!  Shame!    The Mongolian Beef was OK , but it was swimming in green onions and white onions on top of a crispy white noodles deep-fried bed.  Disgusting!  The only thing that was good was the hot and sour soup and egg drop soup. The rice was not even jasmine rice used!  Will not be returning to this venue. Very difficult to believe that this was rated highly on KAET channel 8 on a show called CHECK PLEASE.  In the end, all I needed was my check.  Thank you!!!!",

    "text": "Went here today because it was on the way to a destination and near by. I've been trying honey walnut shrimp/prawns at different places to see where I can find a favorite. I was by myself and made a smoothie for my journey so I didn't need a drink and planned to tip well because of it. Definitely got a weird look but I expected that.. The dining room is just a big open room and lots of white linens so it's very bright. The food came in a flash and was delish. The shrimps were huge and the batter was almost perfect, slightly mushy, but I liked it. I always ask for extra sauce to mix with the rice and it was a good amount. I'm kind of a stickler about rice, growing up in a half Japanese household. The rice was the best so far although still kind of dry but I can imagine because it's made in copious amounts. I asked the server for a box because I had about 6 shrimp I couldn't finish. The server brought the box  and offered to pack the food for me :). I declined nicely because it was only a couple shrimp.I asked for the check accidentally assuming he would have brought that too. After ten minutes I think he might have forgot, trying to make eye contact with other servers was difficult as they seemed uber focused on other things or not really wanting to help a solo eater such as myself haha. Eventually I got my bill and due to the tasty food and maybe for them to pay attention to people like me in the future I tipped well and left with a happy tummy. :) I will be back.",

    "text": "China Chili is one of those places you visit when you want something you know you'll like and need to get in and out really quickly.  I started working on Central and Indian School just around the time China Chili closed prior to the lightrail construction, so my first experience was at the new place.  I wish had gotten the opportunity to eat at the original location just to see if the experience was any better.  I have ordered two things at China Chili: the orange chicken and the sesame chicken.  I only order the former now.  I have never had to wait longer than five minutes for an order.  This is good yet slightly unnerving.  It makes me feel as though everything is ready-to-serve in the back, even though the freshness and temperature of the food says otherwise.  The orange chicken is out of this world.  An entire breast fillet is battered, deep-fried, sliced, and covered with a really delicious orange sauce.  If you ask for it extra spicy, be prepared to feel your face melt off.  The consistency of the heat level is a bit hit-or-miss, but when they get it right, you'll be simultaneously pleased and in pain.  My biggest beef with this place is the wait staff.  Very rarely is service pleasant.  Most of the waitresses are brusque and a bit too efficient for my liking.  When the dining room isn't full, they tend to huddle up near the kitchen and watch the patrons as they eat, usually talking quietly amongst themselves.  It is quite unsettling and makes me feel as though I'm not welcome.  The one exception is one of the very sweet older women who reminds me a bit of my grandma in that she always has a smile and is always so quick to ask if I need a refill.  I don't know her name, but I always hope she's there when I go.  So, visit China Chili when you're in a hurry and craving the best darn orange chicken you'll ever have.  Also, beware of really terrible parking options.",

My favorite part is the lazy susan centerpiece. We all order our own plate and have it placed in the center. Everyone shares and we all get a bit of everything. It makes for a very diverse meal.   I love their boiled wanton soup here. It has just the right bit of kick. I crave this like crazy and can't get enough. I love any of their shrimp dishes and often order shrimp chow-mein. I also highly recommend their orange chicken. It's among the best that I've ever tasted. It definitely beats Panda Express.  The environment is casual and friendly. There's always a buzz of conversation, but its never overly loud. The staff are really great and will have a drink refill on the table for you before you're even halfway done with the first one. It's very clean and well decorated. This place certainly attracts a crowd, but you wouldn't know it from the great service. It's definitely a perfect place for large families. You get incredible food for a very affordable price and the somewhat calm environment allows a great opportunity to socialize.",

It's everything you'll need for a weekday dinner, but not much more.  Try the sizzling rice soup. It's very good.

Quite a bit has already been covered on the expansive room, so I won't dive in to that. And most of my favorite dishes have already been covered in other's reviews so here are the ones that stand out in my mind (that haven't already been described at great length): * Chicken Corn Chowder - one of my favorite \"I'm sick\" meals. Think egg flower with minced chicken and corn. * Honey Walnut Prawns - not quite as good as Big Wongs, but damn good! * Pillow Chicken - minced chicken with a bunch of other crunchy good things, fried up mouth-sized dumpling style and blanketed in black pepper sauce -  yummo!  *Sichuan Style Green Beans - the menu version is made with pork, but I have them make it vegetarian with extra spice and IT IS TO DIE FOR.  I've never actually experienced the \"frozen vegetables\" that others have suffered, so I have to think that this is more anomaly than practice. They are always willing to alter dishes to my liking (more spice, no meat, different meat, etc.) - this is a HUGE plus in my book because I love spicy Chinese. The staff is Stevia sweet - meaning they are all naturally friendly! And drum role please.... I can call in my order, hop in the car, pick up my food, and get my chopsticks on in front of my own TV within 15 minutes! LOVE IT!!",

    "text": "Chinese food is one of those things for me... once I find a place I love, I stick with it!  That was the story for my last Chinese Restaurant until they abruptly closed one day without notice...yes I am bitter.  The restaurant I am referring to was a little place called \"Silver Dragon\" south of Dunlap on 19th Ave.  It was the Cheers of Chinese... I walked in and everybody knew me, and immediatley started to make my meal (they would double or triple it, if I had company).  My favorite dish, was called Singapore Rice Noodle.... obviously a rice noodle dish that included stir fried spare ribs, chicken, shrimp, green and yellow onions tossed with a non-spicy curry sauce.  When they closed, I was in a state of depression for nearly two years!!  Until last night, when I happened upon China Chili, not my first visit, but my first SIT DOWN experience with the restuarant.  I do what I have done at every chinese restaurant since Silver Dragon... I opened the menu and went directly to the noodle dishes to see if they offered \"Singapore Rice Noodle\".  Much to the delight of my stomach, they did and it was EXACTLY the same as I remember it at Silver Dragon.  I am already conspiring to have it again today for lunch!!!!  Oh... they have the fastest service here too, not more than five minutes after we ordered appetizers were already coming out!",

    "text": "Been there a couple of times, but usually just for takeout as there is nothing better than laying in bed, eating Chinese, and watching a movie.  I was never totally impressed but it's the closest Chinese restaurant to my house and so I went back.    Then one magical day I decided to dine in.  It was a momentous day indeed.  It was the day I discovered the trick to China Chili.  You see you need to go in.  Sit down.  Order way more than you are going to eat.  Munch a bit at the table.  Then get the rest wrapped up.  For some reason if you call in a to go order the food is not nearly as good.    Favorites you ask?  Well, thanks for asking.  All time favorite is the pillow chicken.  It tastes just like foil chicken but is much larger with out the hassle of all the foil.  Next favorite?  Anything with scallops.  Seriously the cooks in the back must have a PhD in scallopology.  They are consistently cooked to perfection.    Last but not least is the egg foo young.  It's not on the menu but ask and ye shall receive.    The only reason this place doesn't get a fifth star from me is the take-out.  Food is delicious and service is ridiculously good.  I wish I didn't have to play the games I do but will continue to do so to ensure great take-out.",

They are one of the best dishes like no other and so very delicious, and my favorite when I eat here. I cannot say I am very fond of the service. They tend to move like stealth waiters, all of a sudden out of nowhere they are right at your side taking something off your table. It may seem like the are trying to hurry you out but I do not believe that is their intention. I just ignore them until I am full and ready to leave. One other favorite is the orange chicken  I highly recomend them for their food.",

No complaints! Hot, fresh and plenty to take home for lunch at work the next day. My husband enjoyed the Sweet & Sour Chicken. Big pieces of moist, white chicken. We drove from 1-17 and the Carefree Hwy to check this place out. Well worth the trip!",

They sure can move food to the table very quickly and get you out fast.  As far as taste goes, I have had better. With the Chinese Culture center not too far away either, I would chose that place over China Chili any day. A couple co-workers after having been there over the course of several years seems to be in agreement with me as well. If someone recommends it, we usually know of a better chinese place downtown than China Chili.",

Not sure if this is good or bad in some people's eyes but good when you are lunching on a work day and need to get back to the office.  The lunch special prices are phenomenal -- I always get the mongolian beef, it's huge and delicious.  You get soup, your meal, rice and an egg roll. All for under 10 bucks (with a drink) and maybe even tax.   I love China Chili, something about the colorful disco balls in the giant dining area and the curtness of everyone-- it makes me love it even more.  They do takeout too and it's excellent as well!",

I was glad to hear that because I liked my food too!   Although this restaurant is called China Chili, it takes its inspiration from Singapore and Malaysian influences.   The egg rolls were even different. I was pleased to see that they use rice wrapper instead of the thick flour kind that most Chinese restaurant use. I don't really like those because they are too thick!   Also, being a vegetarian, I was also very impressed with the vegetable selection here. My roommate ordered the Ma Po Tofu. I ordered the Tofu with green string beans, and my mom ordered the cashew chicken.   The dishes were prepared to a high standard and served in good-sized portions.   The service here was quick and friendly, and the prices were very reasonable. Will be back again. :-)",

This review is more like 3.5 stars.  It's also going to be way more effusive in its praise than the 3.5 stars it deserves.  If I'm to be completely and totally honest with myself, this is a good but average Chinese restaurant.  Or rather, Chinese-American restaurant, as the vast majority of the dishes are not traditionally Chinese but more Chinese-American (think sweet and sour whatever, Mongolian beef, etc.)  Also, I can only speak to the lunchtime experience as I've only been here for lunch.  Despite all this mediocrity, I LOVE this place.  Not sure why.  I order the house special chicken almost every time I come.  A fried chicken cutlet, sliced, covered in a slightly spicy brown sauce.  Served with rice and a small spring roll.  A small bowl of soup also comes with every lunch.  Maybe its because the soup is on your table within 5  minutes.  Maybe it's because you have your food 3 minutes after finishing your soup.  Maybe it's because fried chicken in brown sauce is pretty tasty.  Again, I love this place for its 80's Chinese restaurant kitsch, speedy service, and tasty food.    I can barely think of a cheesier Chinese joint to love.",

Definitely a cut above typical Chinese take-out (a guilty pleasure I almost always regret immediately afterward, because it's rarely ever really that good). We both felt like it was a little bland though.   Nothing mind-blowing, but next time I'm in the mood for Chinese take-out, this'll be near the top of my list.",

Had the beef w vegetables, sauce was gelatinous and grossly too thick, which made it really over salty...vegetables very scarce with overkill of celery... apparently there's a rice shortage because they bring out a skimpy little bowl...not enough to offset the two overly salty dishes we had, which were not suppose to be the same, but had the same overly thick gelatinous salty sauce. Not the flavorful dishes they used to have. Service was not good...basically ignored after we got our food. The appetizer which was two small \"egg rolls\" were super tiny, about the size of your finger cut in half at an angle to look larger...a complete rip off and very greasy. Just really disappointed. I feel like the salt content was off the charts with no flavor. What happened to garlic and ginger and sesame oil? Did that get too expensive? Sauce tasted like it was out of a food service gallon jar. It's the same old scenario; restaurants want to cut corners to save money and end up driving their customers away to better restaurants. An Asian restaurant that's stingy with cheap rice is not where I want to eat (maybe could have asked for more...except they ignored us till they brought the check!) Woke up in the middle of the night, fingers swollen, headache...MSG overload. NEVER again.",

I also came and ordered to-go after work one day and my food was also ready within ten minutes.  On top of being fast, the quality is there too.  I ordered the seafood blossom soup and it had nice chunks of shrimp and scallop in it and wasn't just all broth.  I also ordered the mapo tofu, which I really liked.

Everything is unique and different and you have to try some things to find your pic. The lunch specials involve LARGE amounts of food for very little money. You will not finish it. Trust me. Fun menu to explore. Nicer place good for dates. Just sayin'.",

The part I liked was that you get to pick between buns or crepes. I actually like the crepes and not every place has them. However, the duck meat came in all chopped up......... I was expecting the nice slices with crispy skin and that's not what I got. Very sad. But overall, the only chinese food place I go to when going to Tempe/Mesa is too far.",

This is my go to Chinese. It's the closest we have in AZ to some good Chinese food.",

    "text": "We actually go here very often. Service is great and food comes SUPER fast and hot!! Portions are huge and when we go with 2 people, 2 entrees is plenty. Even the soups are big and definitely warrants sharing.   My favorites: Roasted duck or Peking duck with Chinese buns dish: You can't get decent duck often  and this is one of the few places. Actually, it's the only place around here outside of Great Wall with flavorful and juicy duck. The half roasted duck is a great price and good to try for first timers.   Peking porkchops: definitely an example of a big portion but super tasty   House fried rice or lo mein: Big beef slices and pork cuts in there.  Walnut shrimp: Plump shrimp and the candied walnuts are wonderful.  Lobster: pricey but the quality more than stands up for it.  Scallops: perfectly cooked and super flavorful.  Steak: same as above; I actually didn't like the nuts that were included in one of the dishes but that is easy to take out.  Hot n Sour soup or Boiled Wontons: the boiled wonton soup doesn't sound like something I would be into but it's super interesting and tasty!   The okay: Chicken dishes are a bit dry from what I found. Those used to orange chicken from Panda Express may be surprised at the thick strips of chicken served opposed to the typical roundish shape.  Egg flower soup: I'm not a fan of the greens and corn included in there  Great place to try something new! The small downside is because the portions are so big, it may prevent trying a lot of new things at a time but that just means you need to come more often!",

It seems like the food is coming to the table before u even order!  I have tried about five of their lunch specials and wouldn't recommend anything that wasn't made with white meat chicken breast.  Their dark meat dishes like The teriyaki ckn is bleh.  Each lunch special comes with soup that is typically delivered to ur table within five minutes of walking in and all specials come with rice and an egg roll.  Def worth a try.",

    "text": "Downtown Phoenix is severely limited when it comes to good Chinese food unless you venture off into the suburbs or head towards the Chinese Cultural Center. For this part of town however, China Chili was definitely my go-to place. They've got a cheap lunch special and had an oddly nice dining hall. The service is always very attentive and the prices are fair. The food is a mixture of authentic Chinese dishes with the occasional Americanized dish here and there,so it caters to nearly everyone. Vegetarian friendly and good for groups, China Chili was the place I went when feeling home-sick for Los Angeles and in dire need of some good won ton soup, but didn't have a car or time to go to the Cultural Center. Not my favorite, but gets the job done. Just slightly less greasy than Siu Wok down the road.",

The decor of the giant dining room is still pretty plain and the music was an odd selection varying between traditional Asian music and Kenny G.    Ambiance aside, I thoroughly enjoyed my favorite dish, Sweet and Sour Chicken.  It was a radiant shade of orange and simply delicious, as always.  I especially appreciate the fact that they give you a larger portion of your dish than of white rice, a proportion skewed at some other Asian restaurants.  I could have gone for a knife to cut up the giant pieces of chicken that make up the dish, but I powered through.   I'm generally pretty picky about my Chinese food, but China Chili hasn't yet let me down.",

We were sat right away and the very efficient servers came and gave us soup straight away. It was egg drop with chicken, which isn't my favorite, but it was ok. We decided to order some potstickers and an order of Hong Kong style noodles with chicken. It took five minutes for them to bring out the food... wow. The potstickers were really good, and the potsticker sauce was a nice balance of savory and sweet. The noodles were also very good. They were crispy, just like I like them. All of the veggies tasted really good, I could taste each veggies' individual flavor. It had snow peas, broccoli, carrots, and celery. It was all really great. So why four stars? I didn't really like the soup so much, I think it is so lame that restaurants give egg drop soup (In my opinion, it is the worst, and what about people with egg allergies?), and also the sauce on the noodles could have been more flavorful. Overall though, this place was really good, and I wouldn't mind going back here again.",

On their menu, the spicey dishes have a little red chili pepper next to the dish.  Their soups are very good, too.  I tend to go there for lunch because I work near the state capitol, so I'm not sure what the menu looks like at dinner time.  The prices are very reasonalbe, but if you do go there for lunch, go early!!  The place really fills up, and there is not much off-street parking.  After noon time, there are always people waiting to be seated.  Years ago, this restaurant was located on Central Avenue in a little, tiny brick building painted bright pink in color.  They lost their lease in that former location, and the building was torn down, so they didn't exist for about a year and a half.  Finally, they reopened at their current location at 3rd Street and Flower.  I'm glad they returned!!",

Both tasted bland and well....just ordinary.  We were only given a lunch menu which was a bit limited.  The dishes that other yelpers reviewed about must have come from the evening meal servivce.  They sure weren't on the lunch menu.  Prices were good.  Service was good.  Lunches were from a steam table I'm sure.  Based on what we saw today, I don't think the place merits a trip back.

A brief look at the menu and the name China Chili piqued my interest as it may be a Chinese eatery with an emphasis on spice. I'm a full blown Chili addict and a fiend for spicy dishes so I figured I'd give it a shot.    Place was nice and clean, had a very well established vibe, and quite a few locals and staff were eating when I popped in. I tried two dishes and had the egg rolls as an opener. None of what I ordered was spicy, even though the menu *indicated that they were. This is not something that I fault them for, since anymore it seems like no one in the valley is actually from here. All snowbirds and transplants from middle American-wherever, who likely piss and pad about their food being \"too spicy\". Perhaps I should have emphasized to make the dishes extra spicy. I've had this experience in the past with what are now some of my favorite places, and had to tell them YES I am absolutely sure I want it extra spicy, or Thai hot or whatever. Next time, I'll be sure to ask.    With that being said, while the dishes weren't spiced to my liking, they were absolutely fresh and very delicious and a healthy dose of chili sauce made up for it. House special chicken was fantastic and a definite highlight. Thinly sliced white meat chicken, with a crisp outer layer and a savory brown sauce. Would definitely order again. The food was delicious and the staff was great. When I'm in the midtown central area in the future, I'll be sure to stop in again.",

    "text": "My friend and I were interested in trying a new place in Phoenix and we found this through yelp. Rated high so I was looking forward to it. It's a nice, older Chinese restaurant. Decor is a bit outdated but it felt like a throwback to one of my favorite Chinese restaurant.   Service was nice. Not overly attentive but enough. We ordered beef fried rice, salt and pepper pork chops and house chicken. Every dish was delicious. It felt like a lot of compare and contrast to other places we've been but we thoroughly finished everything. We liked how the fried rice had more eggs then most places. We like how the seasoning of the pork chops was on the batter and not the meat. Tasty! The chicken was crispy and the sauce had the right amount of garlic to it. Order it on the side not on top!  Overall, I enjoyed the place. A tad bit pricey compared to others but good food. We'll come again in the near future to try other dishes.",

    "text": "I must admit that tonight being Christmas Eve was not the best night to go, but they should be prepared for the business that they're going to receive on Christmas Eve.  We ordered $85 drink and food for a party of four.  The staff that Sally had on that night was insufficient, badly equipped, very impatient and rude.  Our appetizers Eggrolls, Crab Ragoons were cold, geasy and soggy!  The soup was Luke warm to room temperature! I brought it to my servers attention and she never came back to the table and totally ignored me the table next to ours have the same problem I don't know what their outcome was.   After dinner, I took the Sally the owner aside privately and told her that I was not satisfied with the appetizers but the dinner was good!  I also told her the soup was cold.   This was not the first time I've had a complaint with China Chile.  They always have an excuse!  Denying anything that they did wrong and make they make no exceptions on the bill and offered no apologies.  Sally is always right!  I will never spend another dollar in that establishment. There are many other Chinese restaurants in the Phoenix metro area to go to that are accommodating and respectful to their customers!  China Chili's decour is dated and cheap! The atmosphere makes you feel cheap and cheated.  Lighting in many areas is poor The food is expensive, it's mediocre at best!   The bathrooms are filthy dirty and there's no hot water in the mens room.  I intend to call the health department!  If they can't provide hot water and a clean bathrooms  in the establishment,  I shutter to think how dirty the rest of the restaurant is and what other health codes they are breaking?    There is absolutely no excuse for saying NO to the customer when they say they are unsatisfied with the service or food!    She's going to learn that one dissatisfied customer can create fifty more by social media and I intend to be the one to make her learn that!  If I were you I would dodge a bullet and never frequent this business!       I found it absolutely infuriating that she had the audacity to come to our table and tell me I was wrong and that she would be willing to do nothing and offered no apology no exception on the bill. I must also inform everybody on YELP,  that we tipped the waitress her 20%. Unlike Sally the owner we realize that it was a holiday and that her employees should not be punished for her lack of poor management.   I also need to mention that we all became ill after the meal and I am sure it had to do with the Eggrolls and the Crab Ragoon.  I wasn't as sick as two others that decided it was too much of a hassle to complain about it. So I only ate half of each.   I frequent many restaurants here in the Phoenix area and I would do yourself a favor and avoid giving this establishment your hard earned money and respectable business.   There is a new business that seems quite impressive,   a restaurant directly across the street from China Chile that has excellent food,  excellent service ample parking for the same money!",

We all had the soup of the day which was hot and sour soup.  It was decent, not bad. I ordered the Kung Po Fish from the lunch menu.  The food came out really fast.  The potion was big and the taste was fine but a little bit too sweet.  It came with egg roll and white rice.  I only finished eating half the meal and had the rest including the whole egg roll put in a 'Kari out' box.    I think I would come back to try other food.  But, I really hope they would have more choices on the lunch menu.  The current lunch dishes are mostly deep fried or battered.  More stir fry or less sweet on the sauce would be nice.",

I did takeout from China Chili because I was in the area  and they offered some dishes that I don't come across from take out restaurants near my home.  Both my take out orders were packed well and were large portions that were two dinners each for me. Both meals were made with fresh tasting food that was flavored well.  I was especially interested in the Tomato Chicken with Egg-flower. The tomatoes they used were fresh and not canned. The tomatoes were very sweet tasting like Campbell's Soup type of sweet. I thought it was an interesting dish. I really enjoyed the way they cooked the fresh tomatoes.  I also tried the Flounder in Black Bean Sauce. I enjoy flounder and don't come across flounder much since I moved to Arizona. The Flounder was prepared reasonably well and was in a reasonable good black bean sauce.  I don't know how all their dishes are but the two I tried were good.   China Chili offers the usual take out Chinese and also some Chinese Foods that might be unique and some that you don't come across too often.",

I walked in during the lunch crowd and thought I'd have to wait for a seat but they had a table ready for me. This place looks a lot smaller from the outside. But my God the amount of servers, hosts and bussers working was insane! I never had to wait more than 2 mins for anything, soup, entree, refill, check. I was in and out before I knew what had happened but my tummy was full and I was happy!  I had the spicy orange chicken with fried rice and a soup came with the meal. The soup was like eggdrop with corn added, not bad! The chicken was plump, white and juicy breast meat. Not like some places that serve that flat chewy stuff. The eggroll was small but tasty, I could eat a few of those.  Overall I really liked this place, it looks very upscale but doesn't break the bank.",

It's my opinion that there are some really tasty dishes and some that taste good but lack more defined flavors that you might search for in Chinese cooking - garlic, ginger, scallion, etc. AND if you're in a larger group you'll end up getting a lot of dishes that end up blending in with one another so losing the unique of the flavors.   However that said, there are some great dishes including the salt and pepper fries chicken wings (surprisingly!) fried with jalapenos slices and scallions. The walnut shrimp is top notch without being overalls heavy on the cream, the candied walnuts that coat your tongue with its nutty aroma and of course the large shrimp! Also by far I've had the best tasting duck at China Chili with its skin crispy and the tender duck meat. However some cucumber slices for the condiments would be nice!   On service, I think the main service staff work really hard to make sure customers are satisfied but I've gone a few times when some other wait staff were quite lackluster in their attention to customers' needs. However, I appreciated when I asked about an issue with a dish, it was solved immediately for us.",

If this place were closer to where i live, i would go frequently, but 15 miles away makes it one of those occasional restaurants.   Went here specifically for the Peking duck and ended up ordering $150 worth of dishes for a family of 4.  Everything was good, not LA, NY, San Fran or even Vegas Chinatown good, but pretty good for Phoenix.  Service was superfast! We ordered 13 dishes and we got bombarded with every one if them coming out within 10 min and pretty much all at the same time. It was a bit overwhelming but we planned this outing a few weeks prior, so it was also very gratifying.",

    "text": "Fair is fair, I wrote a terrible review for a Chinese restaurant last week, Now for something completely different...we were in Phoenix on a visit, and after last week's disaster at the Chinese buffet where the food was cold, tough, and tasteless, I figured we couldn't do worse...Yelp helped me find China Chili; with 154 reviews and almost all of them 4 or 5 stars, I figured it was our very best shot at a decent meal.  My standards for Chinese food are very high as I lived in San Francisco for 20 years and have been to China for the real thing; so don't take my 3 star rating as disrespect. It's really quite good, certainly the best Chinese I've had since I left San Francisco.   Decor usually isn't an important part of the experience for me but China Chili is quite attractive inside, it looks small from the outside but was quite spacious inside. Despite being one very large room it was possible to have a quiet conversation. The lighting is quite relaxing without being dim,  and the decor traditional Chinese.  We had Hot & Sour soup, and were asked if we wanted it spicy; we did; it was. Really quite excellent, among the best Hot & Sour I've had. Very rich and full, I was surprised at the shrimp and chicken, which were perfect in texture and taste; the veggies were just the right crispness, the broth was spicy but not too hot, and all in all I really recommend this soup; my companion said it was his favorite part of the meal. He's from rural North Carolina and had never had it before, nor much Chinese. As for me, I'd come back for more.  Next up the Kung Pao Chicken was little disappointing, in that it had too little chicken, too much okra. But it's a minor point, the flavor was delicate and pleasant, the mix of other vegetables offset the okra and what chicken there was, was nice. Unfortunately it was not very spicy, especially after the soup, and so if you order it I suggest you ask for it to be extra spicy. But still a pretty decent dish.  My personal favorite of the meal was the Prawns in Lobster Sauce with black beans. Perhaps a little salty but the flavors overall were delicate, the prawns large, tender, and juicy and no hint of greasiness.  Last we had house special fried rice which was excellent, very fluffy and well seasoned, with beef, chicken, scallops and shrimp. Quite gingery which I like.   All in all, while it's not up with the very best Chinese cuisine in San Francisco, the food and service were more than acceptable, prompt, unobtrusive, helpful and the price very reasonable, $40 for four dishes and sodas including tax; and the portions were more than generous, we took home more food than we ate (by intention). The Soup alone could have been half the meal...  If you're in Phoenix and you want Chinese, you couldn't go far wrong by choosing China Chile.",

    "text": "I ordered one of China Chili's more pedestrian lunch specials: The House Special Chicken.  It tasted...well, pedestrian.  Don't get me wrong, It was not nasty at all.   I suppose compared to Pillow Chicken, this dish seems like its from a different restaurant altogether. Perhaps I should have cut my teeth on something a little less flamboyant than the Pillow Chicken when I first went here, because each dish I've tried after that has left me disappointed.    However, keep in mind that I've been ordering off of the lunch special menu lately, and those dishes are usually a little less spectacular on anyone's menu.  But I guess that's no excuse, as anything you serve to your customers should be prepared to the utmost.    Anyway, today's dish, House Special Chicken...  Its described as battered chicken in a spicy garlic sauce.  Its battered and spicy, but not very garlicy.  Still its decent.  A good taste, just not a very eventful taste.  Of note is how tender and delicious the chicken was.  I felt like taking it and putting in a sandwich.  Again, the soup of the day was the one that I cannot eat.  Don't know what this stuff is...but I guess somebody on this planet must like it.  Oh well, I can either hold this place in high regards related to the lone dinner entree I've tried and downgrade it for the few lackluster dishes I've had afterwards...or I can give them a break since most 'lunch combos' are only good enough to fill stomachs at the office and not to wow the tastebuds.    Meh.  The stars remain.  I keep going back...so I guess its accurate to state that:  Yay, I am a fan indeed.",

    "text": "China Chili is the restaurant that Orange Chicken built.  While that dish is tasty, this place has so much more to offer.  Venture away from the lure of the Orange Chicken tractor beam and try such tasty morsels as:  Boiled Won Tons -- a standout dish; the spicy peanut sauce is more like broth than sauce, but in a good way Chicken Corn Chowder -- a reliable standby Honey Walnut Prawns -- deep-fried shrimp enrobed in mayonnaise with honey walnuts; what's not to love? Lover's Prawns -- half the prawns are in wine sauce and the other half are in spicy chili garlic sauce; very balanced Pillow Chicken -- along the lines of deep-fried chicken croquettes with savory Black Pepper Sauce Sichuan Style String Beans (with pork) -- a fantastically spicy dish  The lunch menu includes a number of their most popular dishes (including Orange Chicken, of course) that are very tasty and wallet-friendly as they include a cup of the daily soup and an egg roll.  This restaurant is run by a large extended family and the place has a very convivial atmosphere.  The people watching here is great.  The customers represent a broad range of Phoenix residents and there are usually a few gay peeps in the house, which is always a bonus.    The decor at China Chili really improved when they moved from Central Avenue due to the Light Rail.  This place doesn't have the decor of C-Fu Gourmet, but it is pleasant enough.  The enlarged dining room can now accommodate a crowd, which has really cut down from the long waits at their previous location that was so much smaller.   Besides table service and take out, China Chili also caters.  The BF and I recently used them for our Tacky Tiki Gay Pride Brunch.  Johnny handles the catering and he's great to work with.  We asked Johnny to create an appetizer buffet, which was something China Chili had not done before.  They did a great job building a custom menu for us and the food was great.  I highly recommend their catering; it's a great way to feed a crowd on a moderate budget.",

It's quick - at lunch time they have your entree out to you within minutes of order (usually while you're still working on your soup). It's reasonably priced - $8-$10 gets you soup, entree, egg roll and a drink, The lunch crowd is pretty faithful so if you get there after 11:30 you may have to wait for a table. Call ahead and pick it up if you ever have to order lunch for the office.   I like their orange chicken, mildly spicey. And, I always get the most profound fortune cookies.

Really not bad considering how many other people were ahead of us and waiting. Standing room only is an understatement. Shortly after being seated, our waitress was ready for us to order. We needed a minute. She disappeared for a while and eventually a different waitress arrived. Again, Christmas night so no big deal. This place was incredibly busy. We ordered two appetizers and two entrees. Everything came out in a timely manner. My only critique was the appetizers were a little skimpy. I'm not sure if this is usual, or because they were incredibly busy. BBQ pork was especially on the light side. Other than that, No complaints. The Hot and Spicy Sichuan Prawns were awesome. Not what I call even in the same area code as hot or spicy, but delicious. We also had the Pillow Chicken which was a nice balance with the Shrimp dish. This is not the most authentic Chinese I have ever had, but I will go back again for sure if I'm in the mood for Chinese. Something tells me it won't be as chaotic.",

I used to come here all the time for lunch when I worked closer. The lunch specials were great, about $10 for soup, a wonton, an eggroll and my favorite SPICY PRAWNS.   The prawns were tempura-battered, deep-fried and drenched in a spicy, tangy sauce and served over rice. It usually has been very good for me. However, my recent experience left me drinking lots and lots of water. Not that it was spicy or anything but the sauce has gotten EXTREMELY salty.   Did they have a change in chefs? Am I just more sensitive to salt? I'm not sure but this was not the same China Chili I once knew and loved. Now I only, \"like\" it.",

Parking is okay though you probably will have to settle for the street or dirt lot across the street.   The portions are huge! I would dare say you could split a plate and ask for sides of soup and egg rolls. The kung pao is seasoned well with lots of veggies. It is made with dark chicken meat, zucchini, red bell pepper and carrot. The salt and pepper shrimp dish is great. The lemon chicken is very tasty as well. It has breaded pieces of white chicken breast fried crisp and served in a lemony sauce.   The service is good though about five different waitresses will hit your table from beginning to end. Every time I looked up it was a new person bringing me soup, lunch, water, and the bill. Some smiled - some looked like they were really focused on the job at hand.   Overall it was a good experience. We've done take out a few times and it is also quick and easy!",

The decor is very dated and it looks like any generic family run Chinese/Asian restaurant. The staff was attentive and friendly. Usually I don't order appetizers or soup before my meal but we ordered a large bowl of the egg drop soup which was very good. I ordered Singapore Rice Noodles and was very happy with the entree. All in all it was a good experience, my friends who went with me eat there at least once a week.  The best part is the food is relatively inexpensive, our meal was $32 for the 3 of us, you can't go wrong with that.",

I was intrigued by Pillow Chicken (where do you find this at other places?...you don't!). Chicken and water chestnuts wrapped in a light almost rice dough...with black pepper sauce.

Some Yelpers have complained about the interior, and while I agree that it is not the \"Starbucks corporate America standard\", I think it is very nice for a semi-authentic Chinese food joint, a much better decor than that of Gourmet House of Hong Kong, which offers up better and more authentic Chinese food in a less than appetizing atmosphere.   (GHHK used to be painted pepto pink, but I think they have upgraded to sea foam green).  I really like the sizzling rice soup, it's a nice change from the standards, but the wonton soup is good, and the hot and sour soup is average.  The shrimp/prawn and chicken dishes are tasty, but have been Americanized.  The live seafood options and duck are much more authentic.",

    "text": "Had lunch here today after hearing all the colossal raves about it. However, once I walked in, I realized that any semblance of having an authentic Chinese meal went out the window (no offense, my hungry white friends!).   I decided to try it out anyway, was seated by a friendly waiter and ordered the hot & sour soup (they were able to sub in chicken instead of pork - bonus) and the waiter recommended the house chicken to me. I asked for it to be made really spicy, knowing full well it wasn't going to be (no one EVER listens to me when I demand the food be spicy - listen, dammit, I'm brown, people). Anyway, that's my issue.  The hot & sour soup arrived, and it was excellent. I was happy. Nothing mars a Chinese meal more than beginning it with a bowl of shiteous soup. Then came the house chicken (with string beans added for $1). Steamed rice costs another extra buck - I get annoyed when Chinese restaurants don't make it complimentary, but again, my issue. Anyway, the chicken was just ok. Nothing amazing and it still ended up feeling pretty heavy. So that dish I'm more willing to give it 2.5 stars.   So why did I bump up the star wattage? I guess the service.   The waiter:  * noticed I wasn't devouring my dish and offered to switch it for any other dish of my choice, no extra charge. Who does this nowadays - in a Chinese restaurant no less? Extra star. * is from the SF Bay Area like myself, so he gave me the lowdown for good Asian food in Phoenix (for dimsum he recommended Golden Buddha first, Great Wall second, C-Fu third - then for Vietnamese he recommended some place on 19th Ave between Indian School & Camelback.) He agreed that Thai, Korean, and sushi in Phoenix is kind of a letdown compared to California, but almost all the Asian restaurants (he admitted, including China Chili) cater to their core customers, who by sheer demographics are pretty much not Asian. That said, he told me that China Chili is THE place people go to for Chinese food, including Chris Bianco (of Pizzeria Bianco), the mayor, folks from Channel 10 news, the owner of the Diamondbacks, etc. etc. So take that for what you will. * When I asked if this China Chili was affiliated with...\"oh, the one in Fremont? No. But people say that place is good and fancy and has an electric piano.\" Bonus points for knowing that.  Anyway, he recommended I come back and get the Mongolian beef next time, which I'll definitely do, plus the hot & sour soup. I didn't mind the big open seating area - many Chinese restaurants in SF are like this, loud and raucous.   All in all, China Chili is a case where service overcame the food (again, how often does that happen?) to come back and give it another shot.   And there you have it.",

    "text": "To find out how the culinary skill of any Chinese chef, Ma Po Tofu would be the dish to order because this dish required the knowledge of how to mix the sauce properly.  Sadly, it was a disappointment from two angles:  1) The sauce had too much vinegar to it so it was very tart , 2) the vegetable that came with it was store bought carrots (Ding Ma-square diced) and peas which tells me they didn't invest much preparation on this dish at all and it was served without minced pork which is the absolute essential to this dish.  The restaurant didn't have any Asian patrons which was a bad sign.  In order to have an ethnic restaurant that earn the gold seal of approval, their own community have to support it which this place lacked.   This place may be busy but it isn't my cup of tea just like the way Chinese screw the British and offer them the worst tea (Black TEA) and charge them the most money so if you wanted American style Chinese food, this will be the place to go.",

My two dining companions had the tofu and said it was not very filling at all and that is was just OK.    The lunch menu is not very large and to me seems to be quite lacking in some staple Chinese dishes that you would expect. The prices were pretty standard for a Chinese restaurant.

Which means that you can get in for some great food much faster than ever.  The service is fast, the food is above average Asian fare, those who love hot n' spicy Chinese are in luck too--they have plenty of hot stuff here.   You may even see Her Honor the Guv here, I have it on good authority that this is one of her favorite dives--oops, I meant restraurants [it's not REALLY a dive any more since they moved to the new digs].",

I never ate IN the restaurant at the old location --- I always ordered take-out --- but I have now eaten at the new restaurant twice.  The food is as good as you remember. Delicious, generous portions of Chinese in every chicken, pork, beef and seafood option you can imagine.   My only criticism is the new location itself. While it is larger than that previous, two things bother me about it.  First, it is one giant room. You can see everyone and everything. I might be used to having booths or partitions to help create a smaller more intimate feel, but I felt a little exposed. Of course this is a bonus if you like people watching. You can pretty much spy on anyone depending on where you are seated.  The other thing I find odd is the room itself. It is VERY well lit. (Again, a bonus if you are into checking out what the table across the room is having. Not so much if you want to have an intimate dinner.) Many huge, brightly-shining chandeliers adorn its ceiling and every one is one. No burnt out bulbs here.  But like I said, the food is still the real draw. I may just stick with ordering take-out.",

Needless to say, a .333 batting average where \"eating without getting sick\" is what counts for a hit is not particularly impressive. And unfortunately, when I checked the County website to give a fair review regarding their cleanliness record, their entire history is no longer available since they moved to their new location. So I have nothing to report to you, folks, other than I've only eaten here 3 times and my Darwinistic instincts will not allow me to go back.  EDIT to add: I don't want to speculate about something that would harm a restaurant without solid proof. But my reaction to the food here is eerily similar to how I would feel after ingesting MSG.

We order them extra spicy to kick it up a notch. Even extra spicy and Dan will load up both the boiled won tons and the dishes with the hot sauce at the table.  In fact we usually leave the hot sauce jar empty by the time we leave the restaurant.    Parking is a bit hard to find on busy nights there and I usually end up parking on the street.

    "text": "What can I say about China Chili that hasn't already been said in glowing write-ups in local magazines and the Arizona Republic? Probably not much. But, because you adore me, I'm going to throw in my opinion anyway. You're welcome.  I first encountered China Chili while it was still operating at it's doomed Central Avenue location. Of course it wasn't doomed due to bad food, lousy service or any other detriment other than the light rail project's existence. So, it moved.   After about 9 months it's back and ready to serve some of the best Chinese food in town. I've yet to venture to the part of the menu that offers duck, but I've tried several beef, chicken and pork dishes and I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. My current favorite is the orange beef. Slightly sweet and a bit spicy, it's cooked golden and crispy and makes my tongue extremely happy.   The dining room is wide open. No booths. All tables. The volume can get a little loud when there are many patrons, and there usually... there are many patrons.    One thing that sets them apart from other Chinese places I've tried is the way that some of the chicken dishes are prepared. Typically, little bites of chicken are battered, fried and covered in sauce. At China Chili, the entire cut of chicken is battered, THEN sliced and covered in sauce. This makes it visually more appealing and you aren't consuming so much batter and grease.  I'll be back many times in the future so I can get my Chili on.",

    "text": "There is no way I could say a single bad thing about this place.  Every time I have been here, it is the exact same thing.  The service is quick and attentive, the food is fantastic and brought out freakishly fast, and the meal is always fairly cheap.  Funny thing is, I used to be afraid of this place because of the name.  The husband always wanted to try it, but I said it sounded creepy.  As a side note, I am not a fan of spicy foods.  I have since come to realize I really like Asian spicy, I do not like Mexican spicy.  So I'm a food racist.  Our first time here we ordered the orange chicken and the lemon chicken.  The orange chicken was nice and crispy, with the chicken being super juicy.  The orange sauce was amazing.  It was subtly spicy at first, and then the heat just built up from there.  We still order this every time.  The lemon chicken is nice.  A light sauce that doesn't overpower the chicken.  Another good bet.  Since then we have tried many other dishes, the Almond Cashew Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Moo Shu Pork, and the Honey Walnut Prawns.  Holy Crap!  You have never tasted how good prawns can be until you eat the Honey Walnut Prawns.  The lovely little crustaceans are served on a bed of shredded cabbage.  They are smothered in a sweet and tangy mayo sauce (I know it sounds kind of gross, but trust me and try it).  Then sprinkled all over the top are this wickedly good honey glazed walnuts.  What an amazing dish.  China Chili, I learned my lesson... Never judge a restaurant by it's name.",

I mean, I'm really broke nowadays, and I regret when I spend the little money I do have on so-so food, and I kinda regret today...   They offer lunch combos here, but today's side soup was something with pork in it, so I had to get something else. I ordered the Vegetable Chow Fun, and it had no flavor to it what so ever. I'm serious, just nothing. The vegetables tasted ok, the rice noodles we're ok. but mostly this was just a bland dish. I have put the remainders of it in the refrigerator in hopes it will taste better tomorrow.   The staff was courteous and pointed me to the takeout desk. While I was waiting for my food, which wasn't long it was done pretty quickly, I took a good look at the place. It looked for the most part to be clean and reminded me of the halls that people rent out for those 20K budget weddings. Many family style tables and flat screens on the walls, with \"Chinese\" decorations scattered in between. Wait, did I see pseudochandeliers with multicolored lights? I think I did...",

    "text": "I swear. Some friends never steer me wrong when it comes to deliciousness.   I was told the house special chicken is the thing to try at China Chili. However, after looking at the menu, and discovering an item by the name of pillow chicken that included the phrase \"pillow shaped morsels\" how could I resist? There was none of that resistance crap. That food was in my belly fast! The pillow chicken was chicken mixed with onion, bamboo shoot and I believe something else and breaded into little pillow sized wonder. It was laid on top of steamed broccoli and then covered in a black pepper sauce. I wish it was spiced with something more than pepper, but other than that I have no complaints. It was so filling (in the good way, not the I'm gonna get sick way like most Chinese I have) I was only able to eat half.   I loved the huge round tables in the center with the lazy susans. They reminded me of ones at a fantastic restaurant near where I grew up. The inside is really spacious and has some fantastic traditional decor. The menu was so large that I found several things I'd like to try next time including a whole section of chow fun food. Fun? Yep. I'd like some.  Downside? The parking lot is tiny and narrow. Parking in a space perfectly if there are cars on both sides of the spot is a feat I'd love to see mastered.",

Recently it seems like most of the places are super run down, the service is mediocre, and the products used in the food are down right embarrassing, well China Chilli DELIVERS! Their food was great (Veggie Lo-Main, Spicy Garlic Prawns *i dont know if this is exact name*, and the Fried Tofu special with jalapenos which wasn't bad for somebody who doesnt like Tofu) and the service was above average. The tell tale sign of this place was two things before I ate the food, how clean it was inside (and kinda chinese cheesy) and the parking lot was full when I drove by and when I came back to eat in addition to that there was a constant flow of people ordering take out. If you are in the mood for chinese take-out or to pop in for a quick bite, I would definitely recommend this over any other place around Cen-Pho that I've come across.",

One of my favorites is the Honey Walnut Prawns. The Pillow Tofu is good even if you don't like Tofu. One of the Vegetable dishes (sides) that they are known for is their Spicy Garlic Eggplant.  The servings are large though, so consider sharing and getting a couple of items. The Chicken Salad is a great summer lunch dish. It is great to go.

My biggest gripe is that like most Chinese restaurants, there seems to be a lot of variety on the menu but it comes down to about 4-5 different sauces with various combinations of fish/chicken/tofu/beef.  But the sauces are good, and the service is quick and efficient.  I would recommend the soups, Hong Kong noodles, and Peking duck.  All were really delicious.",

    "text": "The best in Phoenix!  We have been going to China Chile for many years....while they were at their old location.  I know there is better chinese food in other cities, but it's the best Phoenix has to offer.  We have many choices of mediocre Chinese restaurants.  This is NOT mediocre!  First we always start with the boiled wontons.  If you haven't tried them, you are in for an outstanding surprise.  We had never eaten them in other restaurants, even LA or SF or NY.  These are causing my mouth to water (as I sit here writing the review!)because they are sooo delicious.  We ask them to not put chiles in ours, but they are still fabulous.  We like their eggplant, Moo Shu, Singapore noodles( new for us last nite and we would order again.) Honey Walnut Prawns are yummmm, the lettuce leaves with minced chicken are really good.  We've had thier noodles, their various soups, various pork dishes.  WE have always walked out of China Chile saying \"too bad it's so far from our home\"  But we still trot back there at least once a month!  Restaurant is pretty attractive, and quite large, the same staff has been there for years. You won't be disappointed!  It's a winner!  Oh I forgot one other thing we like: The Lover's Prawns.  After eating here so many times, we are very pleased to have China Chile in Phoenix!",

    "text": "So my first experience here was not so hot. The dishes we ordered were pretty bland (all needed a generous amount of soy sauce). The one thing I did enjoy were the pot-stickers and the yummy dipping sauce. I ended up pouring that pure yummyness all over my main entree. To tell you the truth, I was hesitant on trying this place again until I took a peek at some reviews and found people had lots of good things to say about the place.  So i gave it another shot. The atmosphere in this place is like sitting in large asian shoe box, it's one big dining room, yet it's not off-putting. It's strangely welcoming. You feel like your family with everyone else eating there. I went on a Saturday night and I was surprised to see so many old people. I'm all \"this place has to be good if the older crowd is here\". The  psychedelic plastic lighting fixtures cycling through all the colors of the rainbow makes me laugh but I love it. The service is quick and attentive, however when we tried to order a Mountain Dew and Dr. Pepper, the small asian woman had no idea what we were talking about and blurted out something I could not make out. I heard \"Coke\" in the jumble of words and just said \"yes\". They work as a team there which makes for some speedy service. We ordered a few appetizers: Pot-Stickers and Crab  Puffs. The Pot Stickers were good but the Crab Puffs were not. The inside lacked any crab at all and had a runny constancy that quite frankly, surprised me. Eww. Avoid these. I remember reading a review from Alexander C. suggesting the Orange Chicken. What a great choice! The dish made up for the runny crab puffs. The meat was top notch; moist with no grizzly chunks like a lot of places have. The sauce was bursting with flavor and had just the right amount of heat to it. I highly recommend this dish.  China Chili...glad I gave it another shot :)",

Servers are all over your table all the time.  I know they assume this is good service but to me it's annoying.  I love good service just as much as the next person does but it does not take 18 (yes I counted) visits to my table and 3 different waitresses to accomplish good service. You got to give them credit for trying but sometimes I think they try a little too hard.  My first visit I was impressed and thought \"wow what great service\".  The rest of my visits I have just found it overly annoying to have a server at my table 15+ times every time I visit for dinner. Slow down !!!! It's ok if my plate sits on my table for empty for 2 mins even 5+ minutes. Just as long as you eventually clear it BEFORE bringing me my check you'll have accomplished your job of good service.  But 15+ visits from a server EVERY time I've dined here is becoming annoying. I feel like I\"m talking to the servers more than my dinner guest.",

Each and every time the food was delicious, served in generous portions, and it didn't take long for food to be brought to the table even when I was with relatively large groups. While definitely Asian, the flavors lean a bit toward westernized - not a bad thing here, really; the food is always very tasty. I especially love how they prepare their fish: really tender and succulent. I also recommend their  tofu dishes and if you want a different spin on this Asian beancurd staple, try their pillow tofu. The restaurant itself is big and spacious, a bit gaudily decorated as most big old-fashioned Chinese restaurants are, and the service is fast and efficient. Oh ... and something to keep in mind now that the holiday season approaches: they're open on Christmas Day ;)",

We had the Hot Spicy Sichuan Prawns which were the best part of the meal. We had the Orange Chicken which was okay but we wouldn't get again. House Fried Rice which was very good. Vegetable Chow Mein which was good also.  Net time we'll get the Hot Spicy Prawns again and get another savory dish as these are plenty sweet.  Highly recommend this place and will be back for sure.",

I had not been back to this area for 5+ years and wanted to stay near downtown Phoenix where my friend lives. I looked up high-rated Chinese restaurants in downtown Phoenix and China Chili, of course, came out on top. Well folks, you yelpers here are totally fooled!  First of all when you sit down, the menu gives the impression that this restaurant is a Szechaun or Hunan restaurant. It's NOT! The chefs at this restaurant are Cantonese serving Szechaun and Hunan dishes.  For starters, my friend and I ordered Sizzling Rice Soup. As entrees, we ordered Szechaun Shrimp and Braised Tofu with Beef. I had a hint of what was to come by listening to the waitresses... Surprise! They all were speaking in Cantonese!  The Sizzling Rice Soup was very good.   The Szechaun Shrimp turned out to be a Sweet and Sour dish...  Shocking! There are almost NO dishes in Szechaun cooking that are Sweet and Sour! It looked nice though, the shrimp was ringed around the plate by thin slices of cucumber. The Braised Tofu with Beef was almost as bad, chemically tenderized beef that probably is used from another dish and dropped in the Braised Tofu. Both dishes were supposed to be HOT... NOT!  The only redeeming thing we got out of this adventure was that our wallets were not affected that much by the experience!  Demographics of Customers @ 6pm - less than 5% Oriental, 40% of capacity.  If you want an authentic Szechaun restaurant, travel down to Tempe to Wong's Place on Baseline Road off of I-60. I will be going there tomorrow night and writing a review which will be more positive than this one!",

You also get a cute, little vegetarian egg roll.  In order of wonderfulness, try the Kung pao fish, Kung Pao shrimp, Mongolian beef, and Szechuan green beans. I've only ever tried the spicy stuff, so I can't comment on the other offerings.  The wait staff is ALWAYS friendly and amazingly efficient.

The thing that was MOST impressive to me was the lighting-fast service. We both ordered from the lunch specials menu (which included and entree, rice, eggroll and hot & sour soup for about $7.50). As soon as we placed our order, the soup was at our table. Our drinks never ran low. Our main meal was out in about 5 minutes. It was FAST!   The meal itself was good (not SUPERB, but good.). I LOVED the hot & sour soup. I tried the lemon chicken dish and my husband got the orange chicken lunch dish (both good. i liked his orange chicken better). I wish that on the lunch menu they offered some side dishes. -- i would have enjoyed some veggies or tofu options. None of that is listed on the lunch menu. It seems like the dinner menu is a LOT more comprehensive and offers more family style service, but i wasn't sure if they only offered that menu in the evenings, or if you could order from the dinner menu any time.  Good for a relatively inexpensive lunch meal.  I would love to go back some time in the evening to experience the dinner menu. It looked like there were a lot of tasty dishes worth trying.",

    "text": "Wanting to go to a Chinese restaurant that wasn't a buffet, I stopped by China Chili in Central Phoenix. The inside is a vast room filled with beautiful chandelier lighting and stunning Chinese artwork. Looked pretty fancy for the price, so it's a good choice to take someone special with the apperance you have money. I asked for a small table in the back corner to eat in peace among the sparse group of younger and older people present.   Menu was quite large, with a deep selection of various choices. I was feeling seafood tonight, so I went with the Kung Pao Calamari which according to the menu is spicy and hot. Faster than I could say Toa chie, the dish arrived. No joke, the server walked into the kitchen and the food came out in about 2 minutes. That's insane and impressive.   The Kung Pao Calamari in presentation was great and looked delicious on the oval plate. Red, green bell peppers, cucumbers, peanuts and of course the calamari. Scooped up some calamari with various bits of vegetables and upon first impression it was quite good, although the calamari was fairly rubbery more than what I'm used to. The chewing went on longer than I was hoping. Good nonetheless and acceptable. Portion of food was more than adequate with a side of rice as is customary. I did not sense any spiciness to the food which I found disappointing as I do love a little kick in my seafood. I'd honestly like to try something else next time I come here. I sense the potential here.  Overall, China Chili for the price and the atmosphere it's worth it. I would actually rate this place if I was able, close to 3 and half stars as the food wasn't as dynamic as the more upscale authentic places I've been to but then again I didn't expect that either. If you want Chinese food that has a little more class that doesn't kill your paycheck check out China Chili.",

    "text": "Best not to order the Sesame Chicken, it's unrecognizable and bland. Also they have a House Specialty Chicken that a staff member likened to General Tao's chicken~ it was terrible, we didn't even bring it home for the dogs. A friend recommended the chicken corn chowder, and while she seemed happy, no one else @ our table (of 8) liked it. The crab puffs sucked. And while I'm complaining they have no egg rolls on the menu, only spring, and they don't have crispy noodles. I didn't like their sweet & sour sauce either, too runny, dripping out of bottles, you couldn't get enough of it to stay on the food. We got the last parking space (upon our arrival @ 6:30pm) although there were only 6 seated tables. Naturally, waiting for someone to leave so you can park is less than ideal.  On the other hand they have wonderful potstickers, perfect potsticker sauce too. We were also VERY happy with the Mongolian Beef. They have a chicken dish called \"pillows\", I know it sounds strange, but It's good~ I spooned the potsticker sauce inside, yum.",

    "text": "I heard great things about this place from my boyfriend so I had to try it.  I perused their menu and figured I'd try their famous House Special Chicken Lunch Special (included Sweet and Sour soup).  Since I also went there for dinner (serves food family style), I also tried their Orange Chicken, Sizzling Rice Soup (enough for 4 bowls), and a Shrimp dish (the name escapes me now) -- they were all *very* good.  While the House Special Chicken wasn't extremely spicy (for my taste), it was still delicous to me. :9  I wouldn't say their food isn't authentic Chinese, but it was definitely adjusted to make this place unique from all other chinese restaurants I've been to--which gives it a plus in my opinion.  I really liked how their chicken or shrimp dishes were tender and not dry.  Most places cook the chicken until it's overcooked.  They did a great job here.  I really enjoyed it here and highly recommend it for people who are bored of \"the usual\" :)",

The place is very large and can accommodate tons of guests. I went after the lunch rush and there were just a handful of people in there.  The tallest soda cups.   Quick Service. My food is was out in less than 5  minutes after ordering.   I ordered the Orange Chicken. It's always good to try the popular dish at the new place to see how they prepare it.  Cons: It did not look very appeasing to the eye. It sorta looked just slopped together. Presentation is key with me.  WAAAAAYYYY too saucey! The chicken and rice were drowned in the sauce. I could not even finish it.  Maybe I need to try another dish or maybe just order the sauce on the side next time, but I'm still looking for the best Chinese food in Phoenix.",

The lunch specials are very reasonably priced and they give you huge portions and extras like comped soup and a spring roll. The service is efficient and incredibly fast. The food itself is decent- nothing to get super excited about but good enough to fill you up without being super disappointing. It is best to come here for lunch rather than dinner because they do so much volume at lunch that the food is always freshly made by the time it gets to your table.",

The food was excellent, service was fantastic and for 2 people, with appetizers, soup, 2 entrees and plum wine it was only $40 (with food to take home!).  The only issue is that the room is cavernous, but if you've ever tried places in NYC or SF Chinatown, you will feel right at home.",

    "text": "Thank you David and Lisa S for introducing us to China Chli this past Friday night!  We're always on the lookout for good Chinese in the Valley, and now we have another option (not too far from home) with China Chili.  I didn't expect CC to be such a large restaurant, and they were hopping to boot!  The atmosphere was welcoming - casual and old school; I especially love the disco ball in the main dining room.  The servers are serious and efficient, perhaps because they don't speak much English, but with so many customers, it works out fine... I imagine most people are there for the food anyways.  So without further adieu, here's what we ordered for our family-style dinner:  -Pot Stickers (I didn't have these but everyone else did and enjoyed them!) -Sizzling Rice Soup -Honey Walnut Prawns -Sichuan Style String Beans (we ordered with no pork and extra spicy thanks to a tip I found in Julie P's yelp review) -House Chow Fun Noodles -One of their house special steak dishes (I think it was Sizzling Black Pepper Beef in a dark sauce).  Yes, I know, that's a lot of food for four people but we did have plenty of leftovers and I liked everything that I ate!  Thank you -  (Xiexie) - China Chili, David and Lisa, for a memorable meal!  I look forward to returning soon to try some of my other Chinese favorites!",

We found a GREAT CHINESE RESTAURANT!!! We ordered the egg rolls-very good, Curried Chicken-super flavorful with tender chicken (NOT that weird chicken some places have). We ordered it mild knowing it can be pretty spicy. The Beef Chop Suey isn't on the menu but when my mom mentioned it they said WE CAN MAKE IT FOR YOU! The meat was super tender and the dish full of flavor. She said it's the best chop suey she's ever had. They are very happy to alter the meals to your liking.   The restaurant is pretty. Tablecloths and chandeliers. Service is exceptional. We will definitely be regulars! Try it!!!",

It is a place that I recommend you try and a place I will likely return to.    The food here was tasty and the value for what you pay is within reason.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  Both made for a positive dining experience.  Today I began with a large bowl (enough for 4!) of chicken corn chowder.  I found it to be slightly bland.  Next was sweet and sour chicken and house fried rice.  Both good.  I was disappointed that they did not offer combination plates.  Everything was ala carte (Sat).  Take a chance and eat here.  I think you will enjoy it.  Tell them Chris S. from Yelp sent you.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but you may get a good laugh out of it!  Enjoy!",

    "text": "It's not that good, it's just convenient and well-known. At least it's exceptionally an quick option for takeaway.   Orange chicken is usually a safe dish, but this one was just drowning in sauce. There is so much vinegar in this sauce, it bothered my eyes as I opened my styrofoam box. Oh my goodness, I am kind of impressed because I have never had that happen to me. There's really not much complexity, however. Just sugar, vinegar, green onions, and maybe orange as an afterthought.   The veggie egg rolls that come with combos are tiny and some of the greasiest ever.   The egg drop soup is totally bogus.   As for my dining companion's meal, they were not a fan of the kung pao (?) shrimp. Loaded with veggies, it looked a bit more appetizing. But it was loaded with salt, as well as what I believe to be chicken broth, which is a strange choice.   Look, it's not like this place is a disaster. I'd eat it again...if someone else were buying. I don't really feel like coming back.",

Then my girlfriend started telling me about how great Peking duck in NYC is, so I started on a quest to find it in Phoenix.  It's here.  To be fair, I had never had this dish before, so I don't have a lot to compare it to. But my then girlfriend (now fiancee, in no small part because she introduced me to Peking duck) has had it many times and we were both enthralled with the dish at China Chili. It's kind of a unique experience as well as your server will assemble what are essentially succulent duck tacos (duck slices wrapped in Mandarin pancakes) right at your table.  I'm not going full 5 stars because I haven't been particularly impressed with anything else here and the ambiance is nothing to get excited about, but the duck is most certainly a 5-start entree.",

Huge and crispy on one side. We came because of the check please review this weekend of this place. We knew from that that we should try the Orange chicken. Very good. The sauce was just right,  not to thick not to thin. We also had the Sichuan green beans. Good but we have had far better at the really authentic Sichuan resturant in Phoenix at the Sechwan Palace at the chinese cultural center. We also had the Mongolian beef that a another yelper had suggested. The best dish we had. Finally we had the veggie fried rice. I thought it was ok but my wife thought it was not good.",

The majority of dishes I tasted were alright.  The vegetables and tofu generally tasted bland or overcooked.  The Mapo Tofu and Salted Fish fried rice were decently good.    Near the end we ordered Orange Chicken, and that, was probably the best orange chicken I've had in my life.  Chicken was sliced thin with crispy breaded edges, and good/mild level of orange flavor.  So, if going I have high recommendations for that dish.  For the distance, I would probably not come back again, I'd get something more local that has better dishes overall.",

It is clean, spacious, and nicer than some of the other Chinese food dives that we love to frequent.  The service was fast and attentive.    We ordered the following: West Lake soup, honey walnut prawns, beef chow fun (dry), sesame chicken, mongolian beef, house fried rice, garlic green beans with tofu and Peking pork chop.  Our favorite restaurant is Hong Kong Dining on  24th St and Indian School, but China Chili has some dishes that surpass them.  The West Lake soup was good, not too thick with good flavor.  I thought the garlic green beans were top notch, as were the honey walnut prawns.  Those three dishes I would come back for any day.  The sesame chicken was ok -- it was sliced chicken with sesame sauce poured over it.  I prefer the more Americanized version where individual pieces of chicken are deep fried in a sesame sauce.  I would say the same of the Peking pork chop -- I prefer the dish made by Hong Kong Dining.  CC's seemed to have too much sauce that was maybe a little too sweet.    All in all a gem of a Chinese restaurant that we will definitely frequent when we are on that side of town!",

We love so many different dishes here, but if we have to narrow it down to 3 it is... extra spicy orange chicken, salt and pepper calamari, and the Szechwan shrimp.  The orange chicken is whole chicken breast that is breaded instead of little nuggets. You get more chicken than a ton of breading. The orange sauce is amazing, especially with some spice.  The salt and pepper calamari.. may not seem all that exciting or exotic, but it is delicious! I love the favors the green onions and jalapeno with the salt and pepper.   Our newest favorite dish is the Szechwan shrimp. It is different from what I had growing up. I don't like szechwan anything, so I would have never given this dish a second glance. Of course one day, my friend ordered it and I just about died! I know I am pretty optimistic with my reviews, but I mean it, this dish is delicious and weirdly refreshing. It has undertones of cilantro and it comes with cucumbers!",

    "text": "I haven't been to China Chili in a few years and decided to go with a group of six. The food was decent, my only issue was the speed of the food and service. The speed of the food - was Extremely fast.  Why would that be an issue? We ordered 7 different dishes and from ordering to delivery was 5-7 minutes literally. The restaurant must precook the food and then when it's ordered, they throw some sauce on it and warm it up. For the service - we had to beg and stop the servers for water refills, more rice and getting the check. A water refill shouldn't take longer then preparing 7 dishes.",

Definitely check out this place if you haven't before!",

I did a quick Yelp search to scope out prospects in the immediate area that would be bike-able.  My friend agreed that we'd often talked about China Chili, so we agreed to meet there.  It took me 5 minutes to bike there; I beat my friend by 15-20 minutes.  There is a sad lack of bicycle parking; I ended up locking up to the fence in a designated fire lane.  Businesses with a bike rack automatically earn an extra star from me!  The restaurant is old-school Chinese restaurant.  It's very clean and comfortable.  There are parking and entrances in the front and the back, which is a big plus for a central city business.  We ordered the crab puffs, sweet & sour prawns, and pork mu shu.  We were satisfied with each of these items.  The menu is large and varied; I will most likely return again to try other items.  Located on 3rd St. in central Phoenix, this place is easy for me to access on my bicycle.",

They are geared to get your lunch to you so if you have to get back to work, it won't be their fault if you're late!  While we were still looking at the lunch special menus the server brought us the soup of the day - egg drop with lots of corn in it.  Very tasty.  Wife ordered Mongolian Beef and I ordered House Special Chicken.  Drinks were brought quickly and by the time we were finishing the soup our entrees arrived.  Great lunch servings - large plate filled with entree, rice, and vegetable egg roll.  The egg roll was the only thing about the lunch that I didn't like.  It is one of those very thin fried rolls that I eat by imagining that it's a fried won ton.  But the entrees and rice were excellent and a great value for less than $8.  Will definitely be back for dinner.",

I've been to a couple of places in the Chinese Cultural Center Plaza (the closest thing to a \"China-town\" you'll find in Phoenix),  but I still am drawn to China Chili.    There service is fabulous and the food consistent.   We started our meal with a Chinese beer and appetizers (potstickers, and Veggie-rolls).   The orange-chicken meal was fabulous and all the servings are for two, possibly three people (i.e. easily shared).  I also tried the Sweet and Sour Chicken....so tender and yummy.  We never feel rushed or packed in.  We were there on a Friday night and there was a steady stream of customers, but the service or experience did not suffer.    Highly recommend.",

    "text": "NASTY!   I have lived in Phoenix now for 7 years and have been searching and searching for an up to standard Chinese food restaurant (specifically Sesame Chicken)... and thought I would give this place a try after reading the reviews.   Another disappointment. The lunch menu is tiny, they didn't even know what Sesame chicken was and my food came out in literally 1 minute which makes me think they have a vat of it sitting in the kitchen pre-made. My  mom ordered the sweet & sour prawns and we were both surprised she could even take a bite to try it... just looked plain nasty.   The soup was disgusting and offered no choice besides the \"soup of the day\" nasty vegetable eggdrop and I have never before see some of the things that were cooked inside the eggroll. Scary.   Guessing I will just give up on my search and have to fly into NYC or California for a plate, thank god I am a flight attendant and can do so!   Such a disappointment Phoenix Chinese food restaurants are, how is there not ONE good go-to? You Phoenicians have no standards when writing these reviews, I will never yelp another Chinese place and take the locals words for it's rating.   Pei-Wei it is, unforunately :-(",
