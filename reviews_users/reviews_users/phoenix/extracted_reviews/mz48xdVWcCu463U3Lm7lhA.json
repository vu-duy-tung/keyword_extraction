    "text": "We happened upon this place while we were in from out of town and didn't know any better. Man, did we luck out.  Grimaldi's reminds us that all chains are not inherently evil.  Hostess and bartender were both super nice, professional, and attentive.  We sat at the bar while we waited for our order, which we took to go.  Wine list was respectable, and they have a decent draft beer selection (a couple of standards, a couple of seasonals, a couple of locals...).  Pizza was outstanding - they have not forgotten their NY roots.  Delicious crust generously topped with pepperoni, onions, and shrooms.  In a word, fuhgedaboutit!  \"Small\" Mediterranean salad was really ample, though they could have been a tad more generous with the ingredients that make it Mediterranean.  Tasty dressing, obviously homemade.    All for a fair price.  We were pleasantly impressed and would go back if we ever find ourselves in Scottsdale again (which we kind of hope we do not).",

    "text": "My experience here must have been quite the exception as reviews and friends experiences seems well. I feel my 2 stars was generous. Other than the manager, most else was a zero. Dined here after the Cardinals game on a Saturday night around 10:30. Was glad to see that they were open to 12:00. After being seated it took 10 min + to be greeted despite only a few tables in the restaurant . By the time the manager stopped by we were talking about going elsewhere. We should have!  Eventually ordered a large half garden, half margarita. That's it.  It came pretty quick but after the first bite (garden side) the pizza was disappointing. No flavor and they forgot the tomato sauce. Thankfully the manager was quick to check in and quickly offered to make another. The new pie was better but somewhat watery. The crust was good but it still needed a ton of Parmesan and garlic power to have much flavor. The margarita side was better but also need excessive Parmesan to taste well.  When it came time to check out it took several minutes to track down the waitress but not that big of a deal. We had a decent amount of pizza left over to box up which was boxed for us. Surprisingly it came back piled up into one small box. Is this normal to box pizza in a pile??? Wish I had taken a picture! Kind of comical at this point of the experience.",

We will definitely return next time we're in AZ.",

Well, I don't know how this oven works but, what I do know is that the pizza that comes out of it is amazing. The crust might be the best of any chain restaurant (sorry, Grimalid's, with as many locations as you've got, you can't deny being a pizza chaing). Don't let the fact that the place is a chain dissuade you from checking it out. The ingredients that grace the crust are phenomenal. Their meats are devine and their veggies crunchy and fresh. Definitely worth trying if you like a good pie.",

    "text": "I can see why some people give Grimaldi's five stars -- their execution is consistently perfect.  If you like the modern style of New York pizza, made with fresh mozzarella, you will enjoy your pie.  Period.  End of story.  Well, not quite.  Here are some issues:  1.  The salads are large but uninspired.  Fresh, but just the usual ingredients. 2.  The crust is thin and crispy -- if you like bready crusts, go somewhere else. 3.  Here, the pizza is about the cheese, but the red sauce could be a bit better and more abundant. 4.  It gets crowded easily -- you may have to wait.  This are really just minor things, but they add up.  Grimaldi's is a good pizzeria, but it is just a pizzeria after all.  By the way, they have another place in northern Scottsdale.  In my opinion, this location is better.  The pizzas up north have been soggy the two times I ate there.  Hint:  I think the milder toppings are better here because the crust and cheese are the stars.  Spicy pepperoni only detracts.  You might like tomato and basil.-",

Kind of a \"work of art\" like they try to push with Neapolitan pizza at ritzier places, but not quite at those places' price point. In fact, my pizza was free with the b-day coupon they gave me just for signing up for their e-mail fan club!  The atmosphere here is nice, too. Dimly lit like an Italian place should be, and replete with the whole red and white checkered table cloths that say \"pizza place,\" but they're cloth (not plastic or whatever) and nice.

    "text": "The Grimaldi's franchise is NOT the same as the cozy original under the Brooklyn Bridge. Lets get that clear. They are getting 2 stars because they are supposed to live up to the Patsy Grimaldi's reputation. They use half the sauce as the original, which is aggravating because pizza at the very least is SAUCE, cheese, and dough. Since they use the real mozzarella, the cheese does not melt and cover the dough, which is fine because that's how the original is. BUT to have large portions on the pizza with NOTHING on it, its bush league. They charge something like $2 for extra sauce, and extra it is not. I wish they would not charge for extra sauce. If you ask for a side of sauce, they will bring you Calzone sauce, with chunks of meat that does not resemble the sauce that goes onto the pizza. You have to specifically ask for PIZZA SAUCE and at a cost of .001 cents to them, I have to wonder why they are so cheap about it.   Other than this, the pizza is like the original. The service is excellent. The staff is very well trained, although it does seem to have high turnover.",

    "text": "Whenever I visit the NYC area I always mean to try Grimaldi's in Brooklyn. After having visited Manhattan several times I never made it out there. Not even when I visit Brooklyn. So while visiting in-laws in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area I was ecstatic to see that I had a few locations while browsing through restaurant options out here.   With all the hype surrounding these famous pies I really hope it is the NYC water because quite frankly I was not that impressed with the Grimaldi's of Scottsdale. Or perhaps the entire Grimaldi's hype is generated by the novelty of it all. I don't know.   My personal opinions on their pizza:  -The crust was a tad too crispy for my liking -Flavoring was a bit on the bland side. I rarely ever use salt but I almost felt like dousing my slices with salt.  -Fresh ingredients (in particular the mozzarella) were used on the pizza  The four of us aren't heavy eaters so the large (18\" with 8 slices) was enough to feed us. The Mediterranean salad (I say skip the salad) was simple and came pre-tossed with salad dressing in the large bowl.   The service: -Our server was great. She was quick, efficient and kept everything flowing smoothly -waters were constantly refilled and used plates cleared quickly replaced by cleans ones   I guess I really do have to make it to their original location one day. OR perhaps their Limelight Market location in the Flatiron will taste similar...? I'm not sure I'm willing to dedicate an entire afternoon to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, brave that famously insane line only to consume some mediocre pizza. Ugh. This is why I dislike hype around restaurants. I'm always intrigued and most of the time end up disappointed.",

The cheese and toppings had a weird rubbery texture and the crust was really chewy, taking forever to finish a bite and swallow. This restaurant has a great location and atmosphere, and the Greek salad was excellent. I'm just hoping they had a rookie baking the pizza that night and that they typically do a better job, because it was truly awful. I recommend you don't risk it and try another place.",

I can attest that it is New York style, with thin crust, but the slices aren't so big that you have to fold them in half (as we do in NY). My boyfriend and I each got a personal size pizza since we couldn't agree and that worked out best- we probably took 2-3 slices home in a box that was breakfast the next day! I got the white and garlic pizza, and he got regular cheese with sausage- all so delicious! He wanted to get the cheesecake dessert but the service was a bit slow that we decided to just get out of there to walk around Old Town. But cool fountain and we enjoyed dining in the courtyard under the pretty lights! Definitely the most romantic pizza joint I've dined at~ hoping to return!",

It satisfies a pizza craving without feeling like a disgusting disaster!  Salads are also good -- I've always been pleased! The small salad feeds two perfectly when you are splitting a salad & pizza. If I'm splitting a pizza with one person we either get the personal size or small. Personal if we are mildly hungry, of small if we are starving.   Sauce & cheese is pretty minimal which at first I was kind of afraid of, but now it's a nice refreshing change and tastes wonderful. If you like pizza oozing with cheese or heavy on sauce, order extra (though it will cost you for extra).   IMPORTANT! At 4pm everday they (forget the word...) refresh their coal ovens so they don't bake pizza between 4-5ish. That is inconvenient but I will overlook it because it is so good!  Service is good and atmosphere is great. Delish!!!",

    "text": "This has become my favorite \"chain\" pizza, by far. The brick oven is not hype -- it makes a difference. Consistent, high quality, clean, and great service. The pizza has tons of flavor with a wide variety of options.  That said, I could not disagree more with the review that compared this to Bianco. Grimaldi's isn't even in the same league as Bianco, but I would not expect them to be. And, Grimaldi's has the advantage of not having to wait 2 hours for a table.....",

Grimaldi's is always a hit amongst me & my co-workers for lunch. It can get pricey though when going in a large group. We often pay $15 each (incl tax & tip) for 2 slices each. It's so yummy though! Their tiramisu is also really good. I could do w/o their salads.. I have yet to try one that stands out.   And service is usually very good!",

We happened to be driving by around 8 p.m. and noticed that there were a lot of people in the restaurant, which is usually a pretty good indication that it's a good place to eat.  Well, we weren't disappointed.    Thin crust pizza with delicious ingredients.  Luckily, we ordered a large and it was large!  We took home quite a bit and enjoyed the leftovers for the next couple of days.  We would definitely do that again.  I must mention the Greek Salad we had - HUGE!  The ingredients were super fresh and it was just heavenly.  One of the best Greek Salads I've ever had.  We saw a Caesar Salad go by and it, too, was huge and looked delicious.  We'll be trying that one out next time.  The service was exceptional as the gal that waited on us was full of personality and very helpful with information on the restaurant, as well as the food.   I highly recommend Grimaldi's!",

(which was kinda small and packed) but i was quickly disappointed... the pizza was soo thin... the toppings fell right off the pizza.. and there was virtually no sauce at all!! :( the crust was the best part of the whole thing...   my friend and i decided to get a piece of cheesecake to hopefully save the meal... NOPE... not even close... i almost wanted to cry... cheesecake is my all time most favorite dessert and it was ruined!  the crust was waxy and just gross... the cake part tasted a little weird... kinda like the crust and to mushy.. like they didn't give it enough time to set.. it was awful...   their menu has salad appetizers, pizza and calzones... and desert.. that's it... no pastas or anything else so there isn't much to choose from... :( their water with lemon was my favorite part of the meal.. sad..   Over all.....  The bathrooms were decent..  Parking was not to great.. The food Sucked....  Service could have been WAY better....  and it was WAY OVERPRICED!!!!!!!!!!   if i ever go back... I'm just gonna order Water with extra lemon...",

It wasn't soggy at all but a little greasy because of the pepperoni. I love how they don't put the whole meatballs on the pizza but rather cut it into thin slices.

Because of that we decided to do delivery which when clicking delivery, it sent us to their partner Door Dash and forced us to order through them.  Pizza was delivered completely destroyed and completely not acceptable for pizza delivery.  When I called Grimaldi's they said that they have no responsibility with delivery as it's a third party company.  My issue is that the Grimaldi's website forced me to use Door Dash.  If you're not going to take responsibility for the company you use for delivery then don't offer it and don't partner with them. The manager that I spoke to said that they have multiple issues with Door Dash but it's a corporate decision to use them. We spent $60 for a large and medium pizza, including tip and now we are trying to deal with Door Dash to get a refund for pizza that had the majority of its toppings on the roof of the pizza box.",

The toppings are way too pricey in my opinion because I like to get a variety on my pizza. I wish there was more topping choices as well..I heard they get asked a lot about having pineapple as a topping and seems like they won't listen.  They will take request to do certain toppings on only half of the pizza....but they will still charge you full price which is fine but when I asked if I could get my topping on half the pizza but the same amount of topping to be used as if I ordered it on the whole pizza and the server argued with me and said no without any valid reason so I just said forget it. The pizza took a very long time but finally came out after close to 40 minutes.   The pizza crust was thin but not too thin which I liked.  There was not enough sauce for my liking and the cheese was just ok as well as the toppings.  If it was not so expensive and if they had more interesting toppings I think this place could have been really good. If you like plain pizza i.e just pepperoni then you might find this place is good for you but if I'm having only pizza for dinner I want to add lots of toppings.  The food is 4 stars but after writing this review and rather poor customer service I decided over all this place gets 3 stars.",

An hour and twenty minutes later we finally were served.    Offered to discount the pizza - not the point.   This is a pizza place. That's it. Period. Full stop. Taking orders for pizza and then bringing them to the table isn't one thing they do - it's their only thing.  Epic fail.",

Good service and s always filled ice tea with ice!",

    "text": "Huge fans of Grimaldi's Pizzeria but unfortunately tonight wasn't the case. My girlfriend and I should have known better that after a spring training baseball game wasn't the best idea for an online order for pick up. We were quoted that our single pizza would be ready for 6pm (tonight) 2/24/19 and when we arrived to the drive up pick up area the parking lot was overwhelmed with cars trying to pick up and restaurant patrons trying to leave. We arrived just before six and about 8 people were standing waiting for their pizza and a few guests were upset at the extra long wait. With one gentleman asking the sweet curbside server \"can you please check on my order again it's been way too long\" needless to say after about 20 mins of waiting after I introduced myself and said the order  Was under my Girlfriends name I decided it was better to just walk away. The curbside to-go seemed overwhelmed and with the cars backing up with mine being third in line plus others behind it just didn't seem like the pizza was going to be ready anytime soon. We decided to abandon our order (our sincere apologies Grimaldi's) as it was just not worth it. Unfortunately the online service quoted the wait time but maybe it needed to be adjusted for the influx of business after the spring training game at Scottsdale stadium. Needless to say we have taken note of this and next time we will be cautious when we order a pick up pizza during this busy baseball season. We shall return but really we're looking forward to the pie but it just wasn't worth the chaotic wait.",

The ingredients are fresh and minimal (the way it's meant to be).  There is no \"meat lovers\" pizza as it's not intended to overload the pizza with toppings, which means the pizza is not salty.  It is great if you like thin crust - nice and crispy.  I highly recommend the white garlic sauce all the way!",

What we absolutely love is that we can always count on our pizza being consistently delicious. The quality of the pizza is mouth watering.  We had the pleasure of having Gabriel as our waiter last night. If management is reading this-- please extend our deepest appreciation to him. He was exceptional. Polite, friendly and full of energy. Give that guy a raise!   Before last night we didn't know that they have HH from 3-6 with $15 off wines (other than house). We ordered the Freakshow and it was soooo good.   Thank you Grimaldi's for being one of our favorite places to dine. Keep up the great work!",

Always a good experience and the pizza is great. I usually get a white pizza, ricotta cheese, Italian sausage, and basil after the pizza has been cooked. The cannoli...delicious. Been here a couple times during happy hour and I must admit: I go in with the intention of just drinking a glass of wine and dipping out. 100% of the time I end up drinking more and inhale a pizza.

Good crust, not too greasy cheese (though I did wish there was more), and our food server was very friendly and attentive. If you're sick of delivery pizza and are looking for a unique pizza place, go here. You get to see the pizza being made behind the counters and as expected, the place smalls amazing. This isn't a fast in and out place to eat, so don't come in a hurry if you want to make a movie that starts in a half hour - it's the sort of place where you don't mind hanging out for bit.  I should note - I actually found a piece of coal in my pizza.. It was pretty identifiable, but a little bit of a surprise. Apparently it's a normal thing from the cooking process..

    "text": "Service: We had a great server. Wish I knew her name. We came from California and met a friend here. I ordered a large garden pizza with artichoke hearts and a personal peperoni pizza for 4 adults and 2 kids.   I asked our server for a glass of water and an iced tea for my friend who was on his way to join us. They offer 2 different iced teas here. Since I hadn't seen my friend for more the 10 years, I had no idea which one he would want. As soon as my friend arrived, she delivered a nice tall ice water and asked my buddy which ice tea he wanted.   I had my wife, my father, and my 2 kids plus my long lost buddy with us.  Our server was so cool she didn't \"offer\" to top off my son's soda until my wife asked for one.  It wasn't because of lack of service, she (or the business) doesn't give the kid the choice, or suggestion, of a refill; the parent has to instigate the request. What a great idea! Thank you for that.  We loved the location and ambiance. We happened to be there during a downtown President's Day celebration. Wish we had more time to spend there.  My wife loved the wine bottle lamps even though she is a beer drinker, not wine. We also like watching the cooks throw pizza dough in the air.  Food: really liked the thin crust. I liked the garden pizza and my dad liked the peperoni. My kids favor Little Cezars (ah so much to learn, so much to experience). That being said, the boys asked our server for some raw dough and, low and behold, almost instantly, 2 thick pieces of dough were delivered on a pizza pan in the shape of pizza slices.  Loved the place. Would have liked to have had more time there. Not their fault but ours. Well done guys.  Price:  Price matched the service, food and location.  I would love to return and try some of their calzones.",

We went to a spring training game earlier in the day and then decided to continue our fun in Old Town Scottsdale. Once we arrived we immediately needed some good hearty food. We walked along Scottsdale Rd. to find Grimadi's; Italian food was just what we needed.  There was a short wait so we were offered to sit in their seating area. My friend sitting next to me was about to snap a \"selfie\" when an older women offered to take us to our table. She instantly was snotty to my friend because she was in the middle of taking a selfie, which take 2 seconds; not a long time.   We all followed her to our table thinking \"That was just weird, did she just yell at our friend for taking a selfie?\" Once we sat down my friend continued on her phone much like almost everyone does now-a-days and then out of no where the OLD hostess says \"We won't tolerate that, feel free to get up at any time.\" I was dumbfounded! Instantly full of rage and we all stormed out.   This was VERY disappointing especially after now reading about how good their food is. I would have loved to try it but not with the service they give; I'd rather spend my money somewhere else!",

The sauce is a crushed tomato style, light, fresh, and not overly seasoned. The Margarita is slightly unusual in that the basil is added before baking but it works. Pizzas are very reasonably priced.",

Let just say the pizza's at Tony's are wonderful but what does this have to do with Grimaldi's Pizzeria?  I am pleased to say based upon my recent dining experience that Grimaldi's is a very strong number 2 in my view. That is a very strong endorsement of Grimaldi's food.  The pizza was traditional, on the thin side and the toppings were of the highest quality (very flavorful).   The service was very attentive and professional.  I sat at the bar dining alone and watching the football game and the female bartender was very attentive to the patrons, knowledgeable and professional.  Overall the restaurant made a very good first impression and I will be returning.  I travel on business weekly and to Phoenix/Scottsdale regularly, I am very happy I found Grimaldi's.    I use Yelp to decide where to eat and thus, I take an objective view of my review and I would strongly recommend this restaurant for pizza.",

The place is priced pretty high though, but it is Scottsdale after all, and the mentality there is that it's acceptable to overcharge and have an attitude. But that's OK, the food is awesome.  It's also usually packed also, expect a bit of a wait. But that's OK, the food is awesome.  Oh, and the parking. It's Old Town Scottsdale, so naturally, parking is a NIGHTMARE, every lot is full, I think I had to park half a block away on a Saturday night. But that's OK, the food is awesome.  Honestly, I don't really remember if the service was any good. ... But that's OK, the food is awesome.",

    "text": "My husband and I live in Washington, DC and visited Scottsdale for a winter getaway over New Year's Weekend. We love food and restaurants  and make a point to seek out the best sushi, Mexican food and pizza when we travel.  After much research we selected Patsy Grimaldi's for pizza and could not have been more pleased with quality of the food and the service.  The menu is simple, featuring salads, calzones and pizza.    We ordered the Mediterranean salad which was delicious - and that is not a word I use often in reference to salads.  The salad had fresh romaine lettuce, fresh tomatoes and cucumbers, feta cheese, a few red onions and uber flavorful kalamata olives.  The salad was chopped to perfection and pre-tossed with a light dressing.   And then there was the pizza.  There are three pizza \"bases\" to chose from - mozzarella/tomato, white pizza, or pesto - and then you can select your own toppings.  We selected the tomato and mozzarella base with pepperoni and jalapeno peppers.  The mozzarella was not shredded and loaded all over the pizza.  It was fresh mozzarella placed sparingly all over the crust so every bite had some cheese, but it did not overwhelm the pie.  The sauce was made from homemade crushed tomato sauce with just the right seasoning.  The crust was thick and tasty and cooked evenly.  The toppings added some extra flavor, although we would have enjoyed the pizza without them.   This was hands down one of the top three pizzas I have ever eaten and I have eaten a lot of pizza.    I was surprised to see so many reviews mention Grimaldi's as \"overpriced.\"  Our meal - salad, pizza and two beers was $36 after tax.  For a yummy dinner for two I don't know how you can do much better than that.  I can only guess that the folks moaning and groaning about the price of the pizza chose to top their pizza with 4-5 of the more expensive ingredients that pushed the price of the pizza into an uncomfortable range.  Just be selective with your toppings and you will find Grimaldi's to be an excellent value.  One last note - we did wait for about 35 minutes for a table, which was fine.  We went on a Saturday night.  We had a very friendly server and we were pleasently surprised when we told her we wanted a salad and a pizza but didn't know what size to order.  (My husband wanted both large's.... I thought we'd need a large salad and small pizza.)  Our server told us to order a small pizza and small salad and she was right.  It was more than enough food. She could have nudged us in a different direction and we would have spent more money, but the fact that she was honest about the portions was much appreciated.  Run, don't walk to Grimaldi's next time you are looking for pizza in Scottsdale.",

I was looking up all sorts of places until I thought maybe pizza might be a good choice. Also was going to meet up with a friend who was in town for business. That never happened, but dinner did.   Looking over the menu before heading over to the restaurant helped. I knew what to expect and found stuff that I could like. Looked over the menu and ordered a half cheese and half pesto large pizza. I also ordered the fresh mozzarella and tomato basil. It was pretty good. I then ate the pizza and didn't notice anything special about it, except that the pesto on top of the cheese. CHEESE?! Yes, it was on top of the cheese. I didn't notice it was salty until the person I ate with tried it. It was salty and they like salt.   I'd come back again and the fact they have outdoor indoor seating was good. The outside was windy and they have a patio area inside that was good. Overall full and decent prices for a meal.",

Of course, I did consider that this was NY style-- which I do enjoy quite a bit, but the reality remains that we even have a NY style pizzeria in not-so-pizza friendly Sonoma County that beats this joint to a pulp (Mombo's). I will give credit where it's due and say that the crust was tasty and the sauce nice and tangy. In fact, the crust adopted some of the charcoal flavor from the brick ovens-- which was a nice surprise in terms of flavor. I'll add that they didn't look at us as if we were idiots when my vegan partner asked for \"no cheese\" and inquired if the sauce had chicken broth.  The service was great, though and I wouldn't object to going back if I had pizza on the brain and was back in Scottsdale. Surely there must be better, though!",

I have to say, it was the most delicious tasting pizza I have had in a long time.  The crust is absolutely perfect.  It is thin crust, and maybe the best I have had.  The crust has a savory tast - I believe it is basted with butter and garlic, but the flavor is mouth watering.  The sauce is tomato based, and flavorful - not spicy, but has a great taste.  The cheese was also perfect - mozzerella along with the fresh pepperoni is a simple yet great combo.  The server was friendly, and very helpful in explaining the menu.  The prices are a little high - if all you are used to is calling in a pizza from dominos.... but if you want  a high quality, mouth watering pizza, try Grimaldi's.  I will definitely be back.",

The food speaks for itself: come here to eat some pizza, not to be seen.   Grimaldi's offers a surprisingly nice wine menu focusing on Italian (or Italian style) reds. I had a personal favorite, Coppola Claret with an italian sausage/sweet roasted pepper pizza and was in love. Another great \"pizza wine\" they offer is the Antinori Santa Cristina Sangiovese. Delicious. We had dessert as well, which was pretty good. The tiramisu my friend had was great. Pair it with a glass of Rosa Regale with it. It's... sexual.   Most of the time that I've eaten here has been work-related wine tastings, but the service has always been attentive and prompt. Grimaldi's fills a nice niche in OTS of being an upscale, yet casual and uncomplicated pizza place.",

    "text": "I should start to lower my expectations when I try out new places. Recently I've been walking into over-hyped places only to get an average experience.  Its 4 pm on a Wednesday afternoon, and the place barely has 1-2 families eating there. That's ok, it must just be the time of day. I like the quiet, peaceful restaurants anyways. Cool decorations, a nice variety of seating, and dirty plates on the tables seemed to be the norm. My plate along with my significant other's plate had weird dirt, or ash from coal on it. Seriously? If I'm paying $15 for a 12\" pizza I'm hoping the plates I get are at least clean. Oh well, what can I expect, I'm in Scottsdale.  This is totally the \"trust-fund-pizza-place\". Pretty much every family dining here was sippin' on dat kriss. Ok, maybe not Hypnotik, but they were ALL drinking fine wine. I don't drink alcohol, but still, this place seemed a little too posh for me. I just wanted to see what the buzz was about.   We got half plain-red and half-'white' with garlic. The traditional pizza was pretty darn good, the sauce was probably some of the most perfect sauce I've had, and there was enough cheese on there, but not enough to make the pizza ridiculously oily. However, don't go in here thinking you're gonna get as much cheese as a Pizza Hut pizza. The white side was pretty good as well, the garlic taste was subtle despite the large amounts of minced garlic. The only downside is that the white pizza had way too much cheese in contrast to the other side, and thus it was a little bit too oily. To make things worse, the worst part about the pizza was that the crust was too crispy. Gourmet, wood-fire? That's cool and all, but no one likes an overdone crust that is essentially a cracker with (sauce and) melted cheese. This was sort of the deal breaker for me unfortunately. I thought the rest of the pizza was tasty, but I had a hard time understanding the rough crust.  Its funny because they had like 30 employees there when I went. It was rather annoying to see a bunch of employees joking around, walking around aimlessly, and needlessly destroying the atmosphere of a cool restaurant. Don't get me wrong, the pizza isn't spectacular, but it's a cool place to go for a business meeting or to treat your significant other. I wonder if my pizza is overpriced because the place is overstaffed?  If you have a trust fund this place will be your favorite place. If you don't, then you'll come here once and only once just to say you've been here. If you don't follow hype, then don't worry about making your way over ehre.",

Too make a long story short...it was ok.  I won't be rushing back anytime...  There were seven of us, and we had to wait about 20-25 minutes for a table at 530.  Once we were seated the service was okay, definitely not fast, but not really slow.  The wife and I split a caesar salad and a basil/garlic pizza.  The caesar got poor reviews from both of us.  The pizza was just ok.  It did get better as I ate more, but it wasn't super, nor was it horrible.  Maybe slightly better than average.    Another drawback is that it was quite loud.  We were probably 75% of the way through the meal before I was able to identify that they were playing music in the restaurant, and that the music was Christmas Carols.  They did seem to have the ability to accommodate large parties, so that is nice, and they were showing a couple football games in the bar.  I guess I'd go back, but there are plenty other pizza places I like better or would like to try.",

They're very cute. So the party went well and everyone who worked there was friendly and helpful. The food was good, especially the salads (caeser, house, and caprese) and the artichoke dip. Yum, I would go back to eat those again. The pizza was just ok, we had a bunch of different types, but I just didn't think they were anything too special. I thought the pepperonis tasted kind of weird, maybe just not what I was used to. The plain cheese pizza was really good, so I'd probably just go for that if I came back. Also, parking is a bit difficult in the area, they have a lot but it is really small. We had to park a few blocks away and walking in heels was not so pleasant. That's not really the restaurant's fault though, it's kind of the nature of the area.",

People had warned us that the pick up service was bad and it was better to just eat there. So if that's the case then I would suggest eating there I would post pics of the whole pizza we threw away but it wouldn't do it justice of how gross it was.

The wood fire farm to table fresh ingredients at my northern California spots but it is not the same.   I miss the simplicity of the slices I get when I visit NY.        What a pleasant surprise as I was walking though Sky Harbor airport to see an advertisement for Grimaldi's in AZ!  The first time we went with a large half white and half pepperoni.  The pizza was great!  Flavor, thickness, and quality was there.  Second time was a bit of a miss.  We had the personal white and personal margarita.  Both had great flavor but were so thin that they became a bit cracker like as they cooled off.  Still yummy but the texture was off.  Grimaldi's, I am keeping my options open...we can't be exclusive.",

    "text": "This is one of those places I come to/order from every now and then and when I do I wonder why I don't come more often...  Honestly, I usually get takeout but the restaurant itself is very cool. There's an Italian/New York vibe to it. There's lots of seating and a nice patio. There's also a bar upfront. Any server/bartender/manager/etc who I've dealt with is always friendly.   The pizza is delicious! It's thin crust, which is what I like. The sauce & cheese is what's interesting. The pizza isn't real cheesy and it seems as if there's more sauce on it, which isn't how I would normally like it, but the sauce is SO GOOD and the cheese is just the right amount. Any topping that I've had has been delicious and fresh. I particularly like the artichoke.   A couple of other notes:  1) They do a FREE large pizza on your birthday when you're on there email list (actually, it doesn't have to be right on your birthday...there's a bit of a grace period). This is a great deal!  2) It's a really great place for events/parties. There's a a good sized room with it's own bar that can be reserved and there's a catering menu. I had my grad school graduation party here many years ago, and everything was great. Also, my family did a luncheon there couple years ago after my father's funeral and they were EXTREMELY accommodating. Obviously, this was something that had to be put together on very little notice and Grimaldi's was awesome about it. Luckily, since it was on a weekday they basically just gave us the room and just order what we wanted on site.",

    "text": "The food is a solid one star. (The service was good, but that doesn't warrant an additional star because service is supposed to be good. People primarily go to a restaurant to eat. The food is the most important, and as such, that's what this review will focus on.)  Here are the problems with the food:  1. Their pizza falls *squarely* in the camp of new age pizza: bland, very thin and sparse cheese, and a thin, tomato mash instead of sauce. Each and every slice has a gaping section where there's simply no cheese (see the first photo I posted). And it's intentional (apparently stylish in the mind of whoever runs the place). The very thin, sparse cheese and the mini pepperoni are the blandest I've ever tasted. All you're really eating is crust (see the second photo I posted).  Grimaldi's is fru-fru California-style pizza. This is really a problem because...  2. The very heavily themed retro/historic New York City ambience - the walls are covered in large, historic prints of NYC, bottles of wine abound, and right down to the Italian-sounding name of the place - leaves no other impression than a pizza place that offers normal/NY style pizza: the kind of pizza where there's no shortage of cheese, the pepperoni isn't bland, and the sauce is actually sauce. The thin, floppy crust is just there for something to hold onto. But here at Grimaldi's, all you're really eating is stiff, crunchy, a little-too-thick crust.  If you're going to visually sell yourself as some sort of relocated NYC pizza joint, then serve NYC style pizza! Grimaldi's needs to do two things: (1) change their name to something non-Italian, and (2) redecorate the interior to remove all traces of NYC. Maybe bright, pastel colors? Something to more accurately depict the new age style pizza they serve.  If all of the above wasn't frustrating enough, the tables in this place are too close together. You're packed like sardines. While trying to clean off a table, a worker knocked over a chair on the other side of the the table, and a customer nicely picked it up for him because there's no way the worker could contort himself to pick it up himself.  Due to the very heavily tourist-passing-through-and-doesn't-know-any-better crowd, this sardine seating arrangement translates to a VERY noisy environment. Despite being 2 feet away from the people I was with, we all had to practically scream to hear each other.  Summary: if you want pizza that's practically all crust with bland, sparse toppings that serve as little more than a garnish, and you like screaming to communicate, then by all means come to Grimaldi's.  Otherwise go somewhere else where you'll actually be served real, satisfying pizza.",

If we went back and ordered it with extra sauce and extra cheese, it might be pretty great--but that would add $4 to an already-somewhat-pricey pizza.

With this advice we give it a try their first night in town...and then again their third night in town.   I have never in my life had wine perfectly paired with pizza and with all of your flavors and goodness I crave you all the time. I can't wait to come back. The wait to get a table is average compared to neighboring restaurants and just really I can't wait to come back. I love you, and your pizza and your desert (THE SAMOA CHEESECAKE!!!!).   With love and affection,  Leah",

But, honestly this was the worst pizza I've had in a long time. The pie itself was burnt on the bottom and very chewy. The toppings were sparse also. For a $100.00 bill l definitely expected better. I would recommend Domino's thin crust over this eatery. So very disappointed. Don't waste your time and money here.",

The second trip we ate inside the restaurant and they accommodated our 16 person party no problem. They gave the two little ones pizza dough to play with which they Loooved.   And the pizza? The pizza was amazing. That's really all there is to say.",

I had received a lot of recommendations (in particular, Greg Laurie raved about this place!) about this place and have driven by it countless times. I had family in town so we figured we would finally check it out! There was only one thing I was bummed about: why did I wait so long to go here?!! Pizza came out and on the first bite you could tell it was made to order. I looove pizza but am not usually a big fan of the crust but I would have to say that was one of my favorite parts of this pizza! You could tell it was housemade. Crust was great, sauce was great, and you could tell that the pizza was topped with quality ingredients. Our waitress was very attentive and able to answer all the questions we had since it was our first time there. Inside of the restaurant the decor was NYC themed and it wasn't too big inside. It was intimate and would make for a great date night spot. Overall, incredible pizza and great service makes for an excellent restaurant. I can't think of a single negative thing I could say.  Thanks, Grimaldis!",

We even ordered togo which is usually a big no no for us a 3 minute blast in the oven brought the pizza back beautifully. Not my business but staff had a huge chip on their shoulder about the owners wife and were not afraid  to let guests hear about it. It did not affect the expedition of our food but still, don't need to hear it kids! Cheesecake might be the most honest representation of NYC I've seen. Yum!!! The one star that is missed is due to that fact the salads are thrown together with sub-par ingredients, although that's not why I went so oh well! Would I go back, Sure! Would love to try the pie straight out of the oven!!!",

The '2' is because of the dumb schedule and poor service.   We stopped recently for lunch and had an excellent pie.  But the service was really crappy, it took 15 minutes for someone to wander by and collect our order.  Then we wait another 15 for drinks, and finally the pizza showed up.  No one refreshed the drinks or came by to check on us.  AND, there was only one other party in the place!  The other item is availability.  They re-stoke the fire in the oven at 4:00 PM.  So you can't get a pizza until 5:30.  Now if you want to stop on the way home to get a pizza for Friday night dinner, forget it.   Dumb.",

The kitchen is open air at one end of the main room, with plenty of seating, and a good sized full bar at the other end. The service is quick, with very friendly and accommodating staff. Now to the food and drink. I had the Santan Brew Devil's Ale because they were out of the IPA, but I was pleased to find that the Devil was still hoppy and a good pairing with pizza... flavorful but not too strong. The pizza... man oh man the pizza. Definitely the best thin crust I've ever had. The cooking technique gives it a very nice crispy outside but soft inside. The cheese is always fresh mozzarella and both the traditional red sauce and white garlic are great. All the ingredients are fresh and tasty and worth the money. My last visit left me wanting more sausage but that's a small discrepancy in a solid track record. At the very least give it a try and if it falls short it's all good... it's just pizza people.  Oh almost forgot, the Canoli are awesome! Maybe slightly overpriced for the size, but well made and decadent.",

    "text": "In NYC people line up 'round the corner for the shot to sit at one of the small tables at Grimaldi's Pizzeria under the Brooklyn bridge and order one of their famous thin crust pizzas.  Now, on one of those days when you're tired of waiting well over an hour, it might be tempting to board a flight to Phoenix to eat at one of the OTHER Grimaldi's locations (none of which are in NY).  Yeah, can  you believe there's a Grimaldi's in Scottsdale, Arizona?  I couldn't.  The menu and the story is the same, but, of course, it doesn't feel completely authentic outside of NY.  The coal oven is massive and the pizza tasted great.  These Arizonans don't know what they're missing!  They should be lining up for this.",

But when I want traditional pizza (whatever I mean by that.. I guess I mean non-funky toppings!, just typical topping like olives or garlic) I choose Grimaldis.  Love the mozzarella they put on their pizza and I love the basil and the fact that they're light on the tomato sauce. Good drink menu, too, and hostesses are always friendly!",

    "text": "ok, i used to work here - 4 years of my life. that said, my opinion is probably slightly different than the average review.   i ate there every day i worked there - which let me tell you, are definitely a lot of days. you'd think i'd get sick of the food...and i didnt. i tried pretty much every topping combination possible (except for the anchovies - no thank you.). so here are my suggestions/opinions:  one of the most important things to know, is that the more water your topping contains, the soggier your pizza will turn out - vegetable toppings obviously contain more water than meat toppings. so if you want a crisp pizza, keep that in mind when piling on the fresh tomatoes, mushrooms, and oven roasted sweet red peppers.  second, if youre really trying to compare scottsdale's patsy grimaldi's to brooklyn's patsy's...the two pizzas will never truly match up. given the location of the original, aesthetics are a huge part of the pizza experience - a part that scottsdale's version will never beat. however, scottsdale's patsy's goes to some great lengths to duplicate the pizza as best they can. the owners of the scottsdale patsy's even brought in a chemist to duplicate the brooklyn water through reverse-osmosis so the water used to make the dough is exactly the same in both locations. (everyone knows arizona water sucks.)  a few of my favorite combinations are: regular pizza (red sauce), oven roasted sweet red peppers, ricotta cheese, and pepperoni; white pizza (no sauce with garlic) extra basil and fresh tomatoes; pesto pizza with meatballs and onions. yumm..  as a server, there are a few questions/issues i feel the need to address if im going to give grimaldi's a proper review:  1.) dont come to grimaldi's for pizza around 4:00pm unless you want to wait for the kitchen staff to stoke the ovens (this takes approx. 45 min)  2.) yes, the antipasto doesnt have lettuce, so its not a traditional salad  3.) no, they dont have pineapple. no, they dont have bacon, or canadian bacon for that matter.   4.) yes, thats the full menu...and they do a damn good job of making everything on it.",

    "text": "First off....NYC pizza is not doughy. Real coal-oven pizza like Lombardi's and Grimaldi's (the two originals from NY) are thin crust, mozzarella, basil, and simple sauce.....delicious. Don't get me wrong, if you love Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, deep-dish pizzas then you probably won't be crazy about Grimaldi's. If you like thin-crust, traditional Italian style pizzas that are simple and delicious (more about the mix of flavors and textures) then Grimaldi's is your place. I've had both Grimaldi's in Brooklyn and Lombardi's.....I prefer Grimaldi's. The Grimaldi's in Scottsdale is pretty close to the original in Brooklyn, although not quite as good....hence the 4 stars. Keep an open mind, expect good, traditional, thin-crust, simple, Italian pizza and you'll be all good.",

The salads are good- not too much dressing, but coated well. The pizza was great both times. The first time I went I had a cheese with tomatoes and mushrooms and red sauce; it hit the spot. The second time we had white with ricotta and tomatoes, and I must say I was disappointed I didn't get to eat the leftovers. To finish the second meal we split a slice of reeses peanut butter cheesecake and sipped some frangelico. It was a delicious combination.",

I am a lover of thin crust pizza and theirs, while not as crispy as I usually prefer, is very, very good.  Perfect texture with just the right amount of saltiness.  The large pie is plenty for two people if you like to take a little extra home as I do.  Sauce is good, and the mozzarella is fabulous.  We dined at a high top table in the bar this time, and I prefer that to the dining room, but if you have a large group or family, the dining room has that bustling atmosphere that makes the place lively.  Great place for a date, a glass of wine with a friend, or a family outing.",

However, I am inclined to dub it DL for the pure and simple reason that it never seems to be that crowded.   Considering its location, you would think pizza of this caliber would justifiably command a short wait at the bar or outside on almost any night, but it has just never come to that in my experiences here. It always has a handful of people splotched around the bar and dining room, but I have never once felt cramped or rushed in my times visiting.   I get the sensation that it just hasn't caught on yet, but that soon many of the Oregano's faithful will add it to their restaurant rotation, and before long it will be just as jumpin' as its neighbor.",

But tonight, my parents took me to the Old Town location for my birthday. It was early so there were a lot of open tables. We had been seated for about 5 minutes before our server came over and gave us all waters, we gave him our drink and dinner order; 2 iced teas, 2 pizzas and a salad. He comes back a little later with the salad, but no tea. I had to ask again. Then another server brings out our first pizza and serves the first slices. Our server brings the second pizza, doesn't offer to serve a slice and apparently didn't notice our drinks needed refills. We ate, talked and began to notice our server was nowhere to be found. At this point my mom had asked 2 other servers for a water refill and was ignored by both, my frustration took the best of me, I loudly stopped a server that was walking by and asked where our server was and that we needed refills. She does nothing. She stands there, tells a different server and then that last server refills our drinks. I asked for a box and the check because I just wanted to get out of there. Our server makes his return to take the bill and process the card, good job bro.  If I want Grimaldis again I'll make the drive to the San Tan location where they don't disappear and don't ignore paying customers.",

    "text": "Quality NY style thin crust pizza in Old Town Scottsdale.  Food: 4.5, Service: 4, Atmosphere: 3.5 Cost to worth it rating: 3 (bit pricy for shared small salad, small pizza, and sodas for bit under $40) Return worthiness: yes  Highlights: - Pizza: nice crispy and chewy thin crust, fresh tomato sauce, and quality meats. Bonus for meatballs as a topping. - Variety: can choose red (tomato), white (olive oil), or green (pesto) on pizzas and few versions of salads to start. - Wine by the glass: long list though just ok quality mainstream choices  Lowlights: - Sizing: 2 people is a bit much for a small with 6 big slices. We could've easily shared what they called a personal--and we're not light eaters. - Didn't have room for cheesecake and the amaretto one looked great.  Enjoyed this pizza and would have it again.",

It was a bit on the under-cooked side, but not too badly.  We had \"The Don.\" I like thinner pepperones so they can get crisp while baking. These were thick cut and very small. The sausage tasted very good. Ample mozzarella and flavorful sauce.  The dine-in experience was enjoyable.  The staff was friendly and the service was good enough.",

Only 1/4 of the dining room was filled (at least 10 tables were open) but somehow I was still told that it would be a 20 min wait. Crazy how empty the restaurant was but they somehow still couldn't seat us.  The hostess was rude and quite unfriendly.  All they had to do was slide one small table to make room for a party of 8, instead, we were told to wait.  Then they began sitting a group of 4, another group of 4, and then a group of 6 before us.  And then when I asked about it, I was told, there just isn't any room for a big group.  When I asked why the group of 6 was seated before us when all they had to do was slide one small table, they had no response.  The lesson learned is that if you have a party larger than 6, don't even think about coming here (at least for us, this was the case).  Horrible service, rude, and not big group friendly.  Our kids told us they felt very unwelcomed.",

    "text": "Grimaldis Pizza is coal-oven baked with a thin crust and is consistently excellent! We go there numerous times a month for their pizza and excellent house (full of quality veggies like oven-roasted red peppers) and Mediterranean salads. The quality of their meats is SO much better than most pizza joints. We also love their atmosphere with red checkered table clothes, a huge bar to sit at and a nicely lit and quiet side patio. Numerous beers on tap including the Italian beer Peroni, which is light and flavorful and our favorite.  I am knocking off one star for several reasons.... first the music, it is a bit jazzy and rat-pack like and absolutely gets on your nerves, especially if you are a repeat client which we are. We have probably been to Grimaldis at least 100 times, in Gilbert, Scottsdale and Chandler Arizona. Recently we went to the Las Vegas location and laughed when we went in and sure enough, the same annoying playlist. The other reason I am knocking off one star is that we wish there was another option other than pizza. Even one signature pasta dish, or a calamari or something other than pizza and salad. They do have a meatball appetizer which is great for the Atkins type like my husband, but we wish there was a slight menu expansion. And finally, my beloved pineapple. The pizza is amazing but adding pineapple as a topping option would make us and no doubt many other diners very happy to see.   Grimaldis Scottsdale is overall outstanding and consistent so highly recommend it. Cheers!",

The pizza always tastes good but occasionally you will get one that just tastes a little too moist. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars because they aren't perfect but close to it almost every time.  This is located in the heart of Scottsdale and is a great place to sit down and eat with friendly staff, clean environment, and great atmosphere.

The antipasto was ok, simple...the bread that it was served with could have been better.  But we were hungry and mowed right through it.  Unfortunately, that would be the last food we see in a LONG time. Should have packed a few snacks!  We waited...then waited some more...then waited...then we noticed a large party who was seated a good 30 minutes after us were chowing down on their multiple pizzas while we were still waiting on our two pizzas.    We tried to find our server but she was nowhere to be found.  When we finally got a hold of her, she offered us drink refills (which she forgot to bring) and inquired of our pizzas.  Then we waited.  And waited.  And finally the pizzas came, in quick succession.  They were good, flavorwise but we felt both were overcooked in that the crust almost lost all its chewiness.  Our first pizza was custom and had sausage, pepperoni and mushrooms.  The second one we got was The Don which I really enjoyed due to the meatballs.  We definitely felt like our order got lost but no one told us anything and so we were just glad to be (eventually) out of there.  I can't help but feel when you open so many locations of a venerated institution, sometimes your brand gets diluted and the quality/service suffers.  This was definitely our experience here tonight.  We don't need 1.5 hours to eat pizza and hopefully never will again.",

    "text": "I like Oregano's. I mean, I really like Oregano's. Rare is the occasion that I will not go there for pizza when the urge hits. The problem, it seems, is that everyone likes Oregano's. That usually means terribly long stretches spent in the Boom Boom Room trying to ease the suffering with glass after glass of Sierra Nevada. Yes, poor baby. It usually works. But on a recent occasion when my parents were visiting from out of town, the 120-minute wait time about 8:30 on a Wednesday night was too much to bear.  I've gotten stuck in this trap before. Read the review of Bada Boom Pasta Room to find out what happened the last time I didn't want to wait for a table and went searching for something faster. But wait at Oregano's we were not going to do. So, with heavy hearts and empty stomachs (as the clich might go), up the street we went to Patsy Grimaldi's.  Seating was immediate, albeit cramped. The server was polite, pleasant and attentive. They even had Sierra Nevada, though I refrained and instead drove down about a half dozen Diet Cokes. We talked and took in the comforting environment before loading up on tasty pizza. While Oregano's may not be damned, count me in as a Patsy Grimaldi's fan.  Free street parking is available nearby at the downtown Scottsdale location we were at that night. Galleries and kitschy shops provide entertainment if you're not out too late. And, of course, there are plenty of bars to belly up to after the food fun.",

This place is A-OK enough that it left me as humorless as an average review.  So, quickly:  + + +'s: ample seating, outdoor enclosed patio with trees & those quaint x-mas-like lights, clean, brick-oven cooked pizza, bar area, located in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale  - - - 's: service (quickness & attitude) could be better especially as I was the first customer in there, pizza costs can add up quick ($2 per topping), pizza was nothing to write home about  In sum, if you are looking for pizza sit-down and don't want a long, if any, wait this is an option.  If you are looking for delicious pizza with a fun atmosphere, I'd try elsewhere.",

    "text": "I think I might be a 5-star whore! But Grimaldi's definitely deserves it. Let me say that I was born in New York and have tasted the very finest in pizza offerings. I would put Grimaldi's up against any pizza joint in NY.   First the place. I have been to both the Old Town and DC Ranch locations. I like the Old Town one better. Not sure why, I just do. The restaurant is nice and has both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor is perfect for a day drink in the spring or evening dinner in the summer. Cool patio. Indoors is a little tight, but the tables all have the traditional red and white checkered table cloth. The brick-ovens are also open to the restaurant. Nice touch.   Food and bevy. There is a decent selection of beers, including Peroni. I am a beer snob and like to drink the beer from whatever region the food is from. I have had wine here, but not a big connoisseur so my opinion wouldn't be too reliable. I have always gotten the salad with a pizza. It is very simple so don't expect something with lots of ingredients. For me the salad takes me back to when I was a kid eating at my grandmother's. She always made a simple salad with oil and vinegar, tomatoes, onions, and maybe olives. Sprinkle some salt and done. It is good, get it.   The real reason why everyone goes is the pizza of course. Can't remember all of the combos of toppings I've had, but so far the best has been ricotta and sun-dried tomatoes. The ricotta was so creamy it was like having dessert. I love thin crust pizza that is crunchy on the bottom and crust, but soft under the cheese and sauce. Doesn't disappoint. Just a plain cheese pizza is sublime as well. The pepperoni is awesome too! They are smaller than the usually fare, but they cook it long enough so the sides curl up and get crunchy. My friend Z picks them off and gives them to his wife because she loves them so much.   I have been there once when someone has gotten dessert. Funny story. He got depressed when someone at the table told him they reminded him of a friend of theirs. When a pic was shown of this friend, it was some large man that looked nothing like my friend. So, he put his head in his hands and said he didn't want his cannoli anymore because his feelings were hurt. The person sitting next to me picked up his fork, got a piece of the cannoli on it and fed him. He instantly cheered up. Maybe you had to be there.   Anyway, go to Grimaldi's. You will not be disappointed!",

The pizza was...  delicious.  We expressed our desire for extra garlic, but our server thought we might be overwhelmed.  Ordinarily, I lean heavily on my server for suggestions and such, but garlic to me is something of what I might imagine meth is to other valley residents.  I just can't get enough.  So, though I was \"rescued\" from my own addictions, the pizza was absolutely delicious, especially eaten with an additional side of pesto.  Our server also brought us a side of red sauce (miscommunication), which was really, um, nothing to write home about.    We started with the antipasto salad, which wasn't a salad, and was actually just a plate with the various antipasto accouterments and no lettuce or anything.  This may very well be some kind of attempt at traditionalism, but frankly, I wanted a salad.    The Chianti recommended to us by our server was delicious.  He said it was fuller than what we had originally picked, and I like my red wine to sort of slap me across the face.  Overall, delicious.  No food coma, no grease regret.  I attribute that to the freshness of the ingredients, and the focus on delicious.  Molto bene.",

We stopped going for a bit because we were treated unfairly since we were picky about the pizza being well done.  It got to be too much for us to handle being treated less than a deserving customer, but after some few months gone we had decided to try it again.  The food in general was always good back in NewYork and Vegas, but Scottsdale locations we have tried have some challenges.  At the very least, they could try and make it up in some kindness, but instead we have been ignored like we are less than deserving of service.  We have now gone back twice and have left being treated less than human and at the very least respectful for being a customer....except for Caroline tonight who came through and waited on us.  We always sit at the bar and it is obvious nobody wants to serve us.  Also, we never even get greeted hello, goodbye, or thank you as other customers are treated.   Well, it was so sad.  What has this world come to?  Ashley, wha in the world did we ever do to you?  Last week we thought you were just overwhelmed, but tonight you clearly ignored us.  We tried eye contact, a smile, and a hello, but you completely dissed us like were were garbage.   NOBODY deserves this.  If your company wants to refuse us service than just do that and save us from hurt feelings feeling less than worthy of your service.  This is what discrimination feels like and I am so glad I have never done this to anyone ever in my 56 years of age.",

    "text": "Holy smokes what a welcome! Thanks to Mariana for getting our visit started off right. She opened the door for us and began to ask us the usual questions \"how are you doing tonight?\" And \"have you dined with us before?\". When I said we haven't been there before, she quickly became interested and gave us some great recommendations as well as explaining that its a build your own pizza type place.  When Joanna (our waitress) took over, we were ready to order since Mariana familiarized us so well. We decided on a traditional antipasto that had the best mozzarella and delicious peppers. Then went for the small (which is huge) pesto pizza, that comes with the mozzarella. We then decided to add artichokes, mushrooms, pepperoni, and half traditional sauce since my friend doesn't like pesto. The pizza was made quickly in a cool coal oven and had an overload of garlic (just the way I like it). It truly was absolutely delicious and everyone was so pleasant. Thank you for treating us well!",

They must have been understaffed at the time.   When sitting at our table I noticed bugs crawling all over my sons chair.  I asked to move tables and the server offered a different chair.  When we finally moved tables I open up my silverware to find gunk still on the fork.  I went to an adjacent table and stole the silverware from there.  After finally receiving our food I was not impressed.  Salad looked like it had been sitting g out all day.  Pizza was ok and my kids ate it, but was it worth a $90 tab, no way.  I'll stick to my local pizza joint from now on.  I asked for a manager to discuss my problems yet he was \"tied up\".  We were late to get to an event so I was unable to discuss my concerns.  Suggestion. DO NOT GO HERE",

    "text": "I give this place four stars because it lives up to the expectation of offering authentic pizza in an ever more fake world.   This place reminds me of the classic pizza parlors (as they used to be called) that I remember all over the Texas and Oklahoma New Mexico region when I was growing up in the late 70s and early 80s. Places like Shakey's pizza. Shotgun Sam's. Pizza planet. (Although this place is a little more upscale). Hand tossed pizza (there was no other kind) cooked in a brick oven. Real ingredients. Checker table cloth. All the trappings of good olde skool pizza.   One thing that's mildly amusing, is how this place caters to kids. As such, be prepared for the noise.   There was a family with four small children next to us who's favorite hobby of one of the toddlers was throwing his metal toy bus at other people, or just on the ground. We watched the mom pick up the toy and give it back to the child only to have him do it again and again. And again. Pretty much the whole time we were there. (People are weird)  Anyway, it's noisy.  Don't plan on having a quiet romantic dinner here because this isn't the place for that.  It was difficult having a conversation. It's great for families with small kids, however and there's nothing wrong with that.  Not even in yuppy, uppity, old town Scottsdale.   Anyway, the pizza was excellent, the cheesecake was awesome, and the service was great!    I'll be back for the charcoal fired pizza for sure because it reminds me of my childhood growing up in Oklahoma, where they know how to make pizza.",

Once we got to our table it was only about five minutes until we placed our order. So far, so good. But then the wait began and it was about 45 minute before we got our salad and another 10 minutes till our pizza came.  The salad was a generous portion but the dressing was pretty flavorless.  The pizza was only average. Their sauce is like pure tomato paste - very thick.  Their idea of a margarita pizza to double up on the thick sauce and throw a few basil leaves on top.  What happened to the fresh tomatoes that usually go on this style of pizza?  Really, this is just a pizza mill. The only good thing is that I came because I needed a gluten free crust and they delivered on that. Pretty good too. That's why I give them three stars instead of two.",

My friends family ordered 3 pizzas for their family and we ordered one. They received all 3 pizzas and ate before we received ours. By the time we received ours they were done. So we ended up having to have our pizza boxed and taken home. On top of it we had to pay for our pizza even though it was cold by the time we got home. No discounts, just a sorry. The pizza was good but still. 2.5 hours, just an appetizer, no main meal, full bill. I don't recommend going to this location",

A manager saw me do this and didn't even bother to help or offer to remedy the situation. Been coming here for years, we probably will not go back. This must be why they were not very busy compared to other restaurants in the area.",

One drink came just fine, but the other drink was totally messed up. the server chalked it up to the fact that two different bartenders made the drinks. We ordered two pizzas at one table for a group of 7 and one pizza was delivered 10 minutes before the other Pizza. This made it very awkward for people to eat and have others watch. Next time, we'll take our hundred and $50 someplace else.",

    "text": "I was not impressed by Grimaldi's in the slightest, and I am a very forgiving and understanding customer.  The girl who served us seemed like she was ready to go home. She took our order, someone else brought the meal, and she checked on us once. Then my drink ran out and I found a bug in my food. So I'm peering around trying to get her attention unaware that she had already left and our server had changed. I suppose she forgot to mention that if we needed anything, we should ask someone else.  Moving on to the bug. I've worked at restaurants and know that these things happen.  Wouldn't have even caused a slight deduction if it were handled the way it should have been. I very quietly brought it to the attention of one of the hosts (since I couldn't find the disappearing waitress) The bartender seemed genuinely sorry. I couldn't eat the pizza anymore because all the spices looked like a butt of the fruitfly that I had just dug out of cheese pizza with my finger*ugh* The manager insisted the bug got there after he gave it to me and he \"knew\" that it wasn't baked in. He comped the pizza and took it away. I ordered a canoli since I was still hungry but really grossed out, and we each got a coffee with liqueur.   So we spent 30 dollars on a ruined dinner. We ordered our sodas to go with the pizza, we ordered the canoli to replace the pizza that I was starving for and didn't get to eat. I know how a good restaurant works, and A. you do not tell the customer that she was wrong and she did not just dig a bug from INSIDE of her food and B. You don't charge her for her drinks and replacement food (especially when it's a 4$ canoli). You charge for the booze if there was any (and there was)  So I'm home, an hour of my day is gone, and I'm still hungry. What I had of the food was good but I would eat dominos before paying for service that I don't receive.",

This is a family place and very loud, but the food is good and everyone is happy. There is a good selection of wine and beers and a full bar. We started with the mediterranean salad which was fresh and flavorful, unlike a lot of pizzeria salads which are an afterthought at best.  We had four different pizzas, two white sauce and two red sauce. I had extra red sauce, pepperoni, and artichoke hearts. One of the best pizzas I've had. Soft in the middle and crispy at the edges, but not so crispy that it was hard to eat and made a mess. Not at all greasy. All the toppings were fresh and the sauce was tangy and not too sweet. The two white pizzas were also good, but I definitely prefer red.  There is a large array of toppings and I wanted to try them all. You can also do half/half of different sauces which is a great way to try different things. My mouth is watering thinking about it. I really wish there was a Grimaldi's in LA!  Hint: We went across the street for ice cream afterward to a kitschy sundae place and it was great!",

Our set of three guys got a sausage, pepperoni and mushroom large; it would have been too little food for three younger athletic types, but for three shlubs, it was perfect, in part because we ordered a tasty large caesar salad to go with it.  The toppings on the pizza were great; the pepperoni slices in particular were excellent.  Our server and a manager were around a few times in-between bringing the food/drinks to chat, which is always a nice touch for someone like myself who visits a new town and likes to chat up the locals.  The text message system was perfect for our wait time; we put in our name and were told it would be 45-50 minutes, so I cheated back to the HoJo on Indian School for a little while and when the text came in, hauled back to the restaurant to make our seating.  I'll be back the next time I visit!",

    "text": "For some reason I wasn't sure I wanted to try this place, but it all worked out. Grimadi's is in a great location in old town Scottsdale, right around the corner from a million little art galleries and boutique shops. It's a beautiful area to stroll around in before and after dinner - but if shopping is one of your objectives, make it before dinner, the streets seem to roll up by 7pm.  Anyway, back to the pizzeria. Grimaldi's had a pretty good sized dining room with tables that sit just a hair to close together for my taste. The crowd is lively and boisterous - everyone seemed to be having a really good time gabbing over their New York style pie (so much so that maybe this wouldn't be the best place to go with your hearing impared mother). The menu is simple. It's a few salads, pizza or calzones. That's it. If you don't want pizza, get out.  The pies are BIG. A personal pizza is still 12 whopping inches and no one in our group was able to finish one - this is a place where the to go box is almost a given. The crust is thin, the toppings plentiful and the sauce a bit sweet. I opted for a calzone which comes standard with fresh mozarella and ricotta cheese and to that I added Italian sausage and jalepanos (I love me some spicy peppers!).  If ricotta isn't your bag baby, just have them leave that out. It does add a bit of creaminess to the overall cheese texture (which is plentiful) but that didn't bother me and I thouht it went great with the sausage and peppers. I ate 2 of the 4 sections the calzone was cut up into and I probably could have stopped at 1. This place is for sharing, that's what I'd say. Thumbs up on the calzone for its well done crust and fresh fillers - I'd get this again.  We got the small house salad with Romaine, red onion, cherry tomatoes, oven roasted sweet red peppers, mushrooms and green olives in the house vinaigrette. Awesome and the small is enough to feed 3 people as a starter.  The staff is helpful and efficient. The decor is simple and homey - red checkered tablecloths just say pizza if you ask me. They have a wine list that's pretty extensive and the bottles seem reasonably priced (and they can cork any bottle you don't finish and you can take it with you).While I can't say its the absolute best pizza I've ever had, Grimaldi's is simply a fun place to eat and I'd definitely go back.",

I literally stuffed myself because I had to get on plane after leaving this place. The price was fair based on what you got. When my group went, it was definitely busy and I can see why. The next time I'm in the vicinity of a Grimaldi's, I'll be ordering a pizza and engorging myself into it.",

The savory sauce and melted balls of fresh mozzarella cheese are the best. Our regular go-to order is a Caesar salad and \"red sauce with Italian sausage\" pizza.  Recently, I came in for my birthday with their birthday deal. If you sign up to be on their email list, you can get a free 1 item large pizza! Best birthday deal. Ever. Our waiter that night, AJ, was so friendly. He genuinely seemed happy and excited that it was my birthday! Thanks, AJ & Grimaldi's, for making my birthday awesome!",

I have never been a cheesecake fan, but this place changed that :D It was soft & sweet and just amazing. I'm told that they change their cheesecake selection based on the seasons (that confused me because we only really have 2 in Az, lol). I can't wait for the strawberry cheesecake in the summer!!!

It's been a year and a half since my last review, and I have to say, Grimaldi's - I'm not as much a fan as I was back then.  The pizza was half cooked and only tasted decent when we put it in the oven for another 10 minutes and covered it with parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes.  The chicken in the Caesar Salad that was supposed to be grilled was not - it looked like completely processed meat that was served luke warm; it was so gross looking that I didn't even taste it.    I'll stick with the original review in saying that Grimaldi's (especially the Old Town location) is a decent place to go if you've got a large group... but it's nothing so special with a smaller group or for take-out.  I won't be rushing back!",

They have locations in the Palazzo Las Vegas, Arizona, Texas, Florida, and NYC.  This place is just as good as the Hoboken location, if not a tad bit better. We arrived at 7:30pm on a Friday night and it was at about 90% capacity. There were two open tables inside and we grabbed one of them. The restaurant seems small from the outside but it's huge once you step inside. The bar is roomy, they have a private dining room and main dining room, plus a huge patio.   The food was unbelievable, and service was top notch.  Adrienne was super nice without being fake. She was friendly and just did a great job. She refilled out waters when they were half empty, cleared our plates on time, and gave us new silverware as needed.  We ordered a large sausage, olive, and mushroom pizza with a caprese salad. The pizza was so gooood. It was thin but not too thin, the crust was chewy and not dry. It was so much food and we were so full after 3 slices each that we couldn't finish the final two pieces. The bill came to $36 with tax and tip, and it was well worth it. This location is a must visit when you're in the Scottsdale Area. They have another Scottsdale location, but I went here based on the higher Yelp rating.",

Both times we got a table without waiting, although it was very crowded- a good sign.   The first time, my daughter and I shared a meatball and mushroom pizza with tomato sauce. The crust is fabulous! She liked folding it over to eat \"new york style\" so I tried that too and it actually did make it thicker and chewier- may have started a new tradition in eating style. Ha. Hubby and son shared a pepperoni and it was equally good. The pepperonis are miniature in size, but great in quantity used, and cooked perfectly where they crisp up a bit on the edges. Yum!  The second trip, son and I decided to try the ricotta cheese pizza without red sauce (they use garlic and olive oil instead), and the server recommended sausage and onion. We got sausage and mushroom (I would have gotten onion too, but for the boy). Oh my gosh. Heavenly!!!!! Loved the ricotta combo. Hubby and daughter enjoyed pepperoni and meatball with red sauce.   We shared a large Caesar both times, which was plentiful. I would have preferred trying one of their other salads, but oh well. Gave in for the sake of the family.   The staff was pleasant and friendly both times as well. The manager came over and talked with us the second trip, when he saw my son's lacrosse tshirt- struck up a lax conversation. Fun. Oh- and our server the first time told us we got $5 off because of our hotel, and the hotel shuttle took us and picked us up. Double bonus.  We will DEFINITELY be back here on our next trip to Scottsdale! I can't wait!!!",

    "text": "One of my favorite pizza places in town. Love the history of Grimaldi's too... I visit about every six-months.  The upscale atmosphere is appropriate for a date night. They have a nice bar in front to keep you busy until your table is ready. The pizza is perfection with the coal-fired taste making it extra special. The cheese, sauce, and dough is all top notch! The salads are also well done.  Great place to bring out-of-towners who love pizza and want to check out old town.",

I had the margarita pizza during my first time here, and it probably was the best pizza I've had. Definitely check it out.  The restaurant is very loud, however; so it may not be a good place to go if you're on a date. But if you don't mind just eating delicious pizza and saving the talking for afterwards, this place is perfect.",

We ordered, ate and drank in about 20 minutes being courteous to them closing and had a great experience. I would go back for sure. It's a little pricey but well worth it.",

    "text": "When I took my boyfriend on a culinary tour of Old Town for one of our date nights, Grimaldi's was the first stop. For good reason too! I am of the opinion that this is the best pizza in the Valley. And if you think that Pizzeria Bianco deserves that title then I have four words for you \"come at me bro!\"   I could tell that my boyfriend was skeptical when we walked into the restaurant. It is very typically Italian with red checkered table cloths and the like. However, this place could serve me pizza on any surface and I would still eat it!   We orded a Cesar salad, medium pizza with ricotta cheese and mushrooms, and a bottle of Riesling.  The salad was so-so. I mean, there isn't much you can do to tweak a Cesar salad. It is what it is. And this one was a great pre-dinner snack.  The pizza! Oh lord, the pizza! So delicious! I highly recommend putting ricotta cheese on anything that you order as it is melty and delicious. We ate the whole pizza between the two of us just because it was so damn good!   We visited Grimaldi's on a hot Tuesday night, so we got right in. I would suggest making reservations if you want to eat there on a weekend night or during the winter months. Overall, it is a great experience with fabulous service, food, and atmosphere!",

    "text": "Another long over due review. Grimaldi's became a quick favorite when we moved to Phoenix. A good friend of ours is from Rome and highly recommended Grimaldi's - obviously if a born and raised Italian tells you to go somewhere for Pizza, you go!  This review is specific to our experience this past Thursday evening. We arrived around 7 PM and there was no wait. The first thing we noticed was an unusually bad odor right as you entered the restaurant. Like I said, we come here frequently, and this was not typical, but should have been a red flag the night wouldn't go as planned. We were seated quickly. At the table we noticed that one of the four plates had grease or oil on it - an obviously dirty plate. We pointed it out to the server and he examined the plate and said he would be back with a new one. Here is where it gets concerning and my stomach turning... we watched the server stack the plate on a stack of clean plates...then moments later we watched someone set tables... with those same plates. Come on! Do you want the health department coming after you?? How lazy can you be? While watching the individual set the tables we also noticed that he was not changing table cloths, instead he was flipping them over to hide food residue. Even funnier, OUR table cloth had food residue on it... he must have forgotten to flip it... not amused.   On to the food! We always order an 18 inch extra sauce and extra ricotta pizza. It is the way to go! Simple, fresh, crispy crust. It was delicious as always - not an ounce of grease. We also had a Mediterranean salad - initially we ordered two, but were only served and only charged for one... guess our server didn't listen well enough? He also neglected to warn us that the salads are sized to share. Had he said that, we would have only ordered one and I wouldn't be writing that he failed to take our order correctly.   We finished almost all the pizza but had one slice left. We requested to get a box. The server took the pizza away and brought the check. We asked again if he had boxed up the remaining slice and he told us he was going to get it. He came back with a bizarre story about having put it in a warmer and someone must have thrown it out... why would you put a single slice of pizza that is being taken to go into a warmer? I am 99% sure he again did not listen and tossed it out. He told us the manager would be over to speak with us (we didn't request to speak to a manager nor did we fill her in on the rest of our experience). She arrived shortly and said she had heard he threw out our pizza and handed a $5 gift card. The interaction was so casual and had no apology. Certainly not what you would expect from a manager.   I am torn by this experience. My mom was visiting and we talked Grimaldi's up - I mean who wants to have pizza on vacation? Luckily she was impressed with the food... but none of us were impressed with the cleanliness practices observed and the lack of focus from the staff. Maybe we will try a different location, if they are cleaning like this in the dining area, I would be concerned about the kitchen too...",

However, this is where things started to go downhill. They proceeded to mess up 3 of the 4 pizzas we ordered for the table (traditional when we ordered pesto, added pork on one when they didn't want it, and forgot to make one altogether). They immediately offered to replace them and correct the mistake but it took quite a while and I was a bit surprised when they didn't offer to throw in a discount or even comp the drinks (not that this would be required, but would be typical). The server seemed to be far less skilled than you would expect at this caliber of restaurant. Aside from the mistakes, the water glasses stayed empty for long periods of time, which is a very important indicator to me. They probably do much better with smaller groups, but they surely struggled with our larger group. As for the food, the pizza is wonderful. The crust has the perfect amount of crisp, chew, and flavor. The toppings are made up of quality ingredients. If only the service had been better it wouldn't have overshadowed the food.",

I know who in town has great pizza and who to avoid. I must admit Grimaldi's wasn't on either list until now.  Our visit was on Tuesday July 3rd and after a phone call to the restaurant to check on wait times, we were assured there was plenty of room at the moment, just come on in. When we arrived the hosts offered us the first table next to the front door in the bar area. I was hoping to sit closer to the open kitchen but was told \"have this now or wait for any other table\". I get it they really wanted to seat this table, either for server rotation or to have 6 good looking people in the front window. we took the table.  Service was great and half price bottles of wine suggested. We started with a large salad that was just big enough for 6 and 3 bottles of wine. we could have stopped right there with a 4 star review, but then came the pizzas! 2 large pies one white with mushrooms and a side of calzone sauce, and the second was a veggie pizza with added pepperoni. These pizzas were a solid 10 outta 10. perfectly crafted and beautiful to look at, and then the first bite! That first bite was perfection and the flavors of the veggies soared, the sauce had the perfect tang and the melted cheese has the perfect golden toast to it just enough that it stayed creamy but had that flavor any great pizzaiolo strives for. All that on an excellent hand tossed crust that was baked to absolute perfection!  There is lots of great pizza in this town and now a days there is so much wood burning craft pizza but Grimaldi's is Old School NY Italian/American done right.",

We usually get the traditional pizza which has always been a 5/5 but today we got a Margherita pizza and it was a 1/5. Not very good, and extremely disappointing. It was overdone, the basil was so burnt that we had to peel it all off, and the crust was so hard we could barely eat it. Normally I'd rate my experience a 5-star but this time it was no good. What a bummer.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite pizza joints in AZ. First let me start off by saying their classic pizza is tasty, not a fan of red sauce usually, but theirs is delicious. It's fresh tasting, and has just the right amount of spice, and it's not sugary sweet. But the winner here is the White Pizza, it is off the hook!! This is just a yummy combination of Olive Oil, Seasonings, beautiful Fresh Mozzarella Cheese, and lots of wonderful roasted garlic, it is amazing!!! The Caprese  Salad is also a  winner, beautiful fresh tomatoes, fresh Mozzarella, Basil, and a very nice balsamic reduction, so tasty and fresh!! This is a must stop for me when I'm in Old Town Scottsdale, especially since the landlord forced the closure of the one in Tucson!",

Service was great, we had Paulo as our server(hope I spelled his name right) He was very attentive and kind. Very happy with his service from start to finish. This was my 3rd time to a Grimaldis and he was the first to serve us our pizza of choice onto our plates, which I really liked. Definitely recommend this place especially if you're looking for gluten free pizza.",

No free refills on this special, was bummed I wasn't told this before hand.  It was okay tasting, I should have just gotten the regular.  They have specialty pizzas that all sounded pretty delicious.  We had a hard time picking, so we opted to make our own.  We were seated next to the oven and could see them making the pizzas.  Was entertaining and smelled amazing. Pizza was delicious.  Thin crust usually isn't my scene, but this was pretty damn good.  Our server was pretty attentive, funny. Towards the end he sorta disappeared, and it took awhile to get our check.  However, the overall experience was great and we wouldn't mind visiting again.",

Is it the best pizza I've ever had? No. Is it a darn good pizza? Yes. I have had a few different options, my favorite being the white pizza.  My one gripe with Grimaldi's is the price, it is not even middle of the road in price - this may be one of the more expensive places I've ever had a pizza from.  I recommend this spot though, I've only been to the one in Old Town and it never disappoints in terms of taste and quality.",

So, we ordered a small spinach salad, a large The Don pizza, and a carafe of wine. Overall - fantastic!  The salad was delicious. It had plenty of crispy bacon and yummy Gorgonzola cheese. The Don was very good. With pepperoni, Italian sausage, and meatballs, it was a hearty thin crust pizza. Watch for rolling meatballs! The wine was one we knew - 19 Crimes. It is a delicious and smooth red blend. Top notch dinner!  Our waiter was pleasant and attentive. I observed all waitstaff hustling tables. The noise got louder as the place filled. Towards the end of dinner it was full and very loud! I thought this would make a good first date location, but not when busy.   Good: the large pizza is really large. The wine bottle chandeliers were fun!  Bad: noise level when the place is busy.",

The Caldone is made fresh so it took a little longer, but was worth the wait. The Pesto pizza was just perfect too. Love this place. I'll be back.",

Sometimes I wake up at two a.m..  There will be that familiar craving - ok, I'll just go grab one slice, and leave the rest for lunch.  Back to bed.  Up again at five a.m.  Time to get ready for work.  man, I'm hungry.  Scarf.  No more lunch pizza.  Make bologna sandwich for lunch.  Service has always been spot-on, I can honestly say I have never had bad service at this store, and I've been going for years.  My Peroni is always refilled, the food is always perfectly done, and the once or twice a mistake was made, the Manager caught it and brought us a free pie before we even knew there was a problem.  What?  MORE pizza?  Yeah, I\"m gonna refuse that.  Great pies, great service, nice ambiance, especially with the courtyard patio.  Prices are compatible with other \"high-end\" pizza places, but the value is greater.",

    "text": "I've been to several Grimaldi's Pizzarias around Phoenix and I think they're pretty consistent. Consistently good, that is.   The parking at this location is a little more of a challenge than the others since it is right in downtown Scottsdale, but it is very convenient if you're already in downtown and walking around.   As with the other locations, there is a little bar up front and a main dining area behind that with a view of the pizza oven (okay, it is more like the \"view\" that will bump up your apartment or hotel rate, but you can see the people making the pizzas)  We were seated almost immediately, which I would expect for 3:45pm on a weekday -- our eating schedule had gotten messed up due to travel, which benefitted us here: no wait! We were greeted by Cassandra and our drink order was taken and filled quickly, despite what seemed like a skeleton crew and a fairly full dining room. We placed our pizza order after deciding that we would order extra so that we could have leftovers for lunch the next day and then relaxed while the order was prepared. During that time, the sodas were kept full and we had a side order of bread (skipping breakfast AND lunch... and then running 12 miles can leave you pretty hungry!)  The first pizza arrived a few minutes before the second one (yah, we were ALL hungry!) and we dug into it immediately. Perfectly hot and fresh -- it was topped with red sauce and cheese. If you haven't been here before, I highly recommend starting with that since the minimal toppings allow the crust to crisp up nicely. Our second pie had sausage and pepperoni on it and was likewise very tasty.  Tip: Ask for some oregano and garlic powder if you like those things. They can enhance your experience if you like a little extra flavor.  The check was delivered and processed quickly and efficiently, and I am looking forward to eating leftovers today for lunch. We had 4 people (2 adults and 2 kids), ordered a large and a small pizza and have about 1/2 pizza leftover for today.",

The toppings were swimming and I mean swimming in sauce on the top and the cheese was under the sauce and toppings. It looked like an Italian pasta dish without the pasta. Tried it the next day and had to take a spatula to scrape it out of the box, it had adhered to the cardboard, but thought Oh well if I heated it up maybe it would be better as a left over. Wrong. It really was worse. No thanks, Domino's would have been much better and saved me alot of bucks",

I showed her the e-mail which is a generic $5.00 off next order. She couldn't honor, I spoke to the mgr. He said nope, not the same day, 72 hours. I asked where is this policy in writing on webpage, or e-mail he walked away and never came back. Seems trite over a birthday perk, pizza was done in box and the kitchen staff was thankful. So best to put in print Grimaldi's, maybe go over customer service 101 with your manager. I like your pizza, although there are so many other options in Scottdale.",

Do not think that you are being viewed by other diners because that is not the case. They also have outdoor heaters to keep it warm.  Colton was our waiter and he was phenomenal. Usually I am critical in waiters but he was always smiling, joking and seemingly interested in his job. He was very attentive and we had nothing but good things to say about him.  We all ordered either a pizza or a calzone and they were great. I was a bigger fan of the calzone as I am not a big pizza fan, but the pizza was also done well. We had about a 20 min wait for food, which is completely normal and is not excessive at all. We did have a gentleman come out, who I presume was the manager and informed us that he was not satisfied with how my calzone was cooked so they would remake it. I am shocked that someone would do this as I have never encountered a manager not being satisfied and taking matters into his own hands. They were apologetic, but it truly did not matter to me as I was enjoying the weather. Once the calzone got out, no more than 5 minutes, they offered to dish it up to me as well and it was by far the best calzone I have ever had.  Overall, I am extremely pleased with Grimaldi's and Colton as a waiter. I would consider this a top notch establishment with very respectful staff.",

    "text": "I love Grimaldi's pizza, it is absolutely freaking delicious. My personal recommendation would be their white pizza and add some vegetables, but literally every pizza I have had here is amazing. They also have an alright selection of beers, and the place looks good inside. Now the downside is the service at the Scottsdale location is awful, I mean just awful. Last time I came here it seemed like they were beyond slow and everyone had an attitude and like they were doing me a favor by seating me and getting me food. Also it can get quite pricey, I mean its like $15-30 per pizza depending on what you order. I will stick with the location at Scottsdale Quarter as the service seems much better.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times, and I'm a fan.  I am impressed with the amount of money they spend filtering their water to be chemically similar to New York City water. If you know some of the science of baking, the minerals present in the water will affect the gluten development (among other things) and this can have a noticeable effect on the resulting pizza crust.  Any place that is fanatic about their pizza as Grimaldi's clearly cares about the product they produce, and Grimaldi's has a great product.  The service is so-so. One time I went the guy kept trying to be funny as he tried to up-sell us on apps and desserts. But he did it in such a way that it was more irritating than funny, and you could tell he was just going through the motions. I thought it was sad to see an employee working who was clearly not enthusiastic about his job. (We all have off days, so I'm not going to slam them on that one interaction.)  I went on Monday and I told my waitress I wanted a white pizza with ricotta cheese and sun dried tomatoes. When the pizza arrives: ricotta and red bell peppers... at least she got the right color! ;)  I've also been when the waitstaff was just inattentive and didn't fill my drink when it needed to be filled. (If you've read my other reviews, you know that's a big deal for me when it comes to sit-down restaurants... if you aren't going to have a dispenser out for your customers to fill themselves, then your waitstaff needs to be attentive.)  Overall, it's great. I keep going back. The service is not what I'd consider deserving of a 5-star rating, but it is arguably better than most. I just don't want to be frivolous with my 5-star ratings.",

But Grimaldi's still beats them all out.  Even though I am a pizza enthusiast I am not one who can analyze every ingredient, so I won't be describing the pizza taste in detail here, I just know if it tastes good or not.  I just got back from a trip to Seattle, and visited two places that claimed to be certified from Italy for their pizza, and I would still take Grimaldi's over them.  I think Bianca is way over hyped, and I'm not one who is eager to wait over two hours for my dinner.  Salads are great, pizza is great GO HERE!!!  Only thing I would complain about is that all pizzas are make your own, and adding a couple toppings can run up the bill.  But even just getting pepperoni is amazing.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I have to say I was disappointed in Grimaldi's =(.  Let's start off by talking about the food.   The menu is limited to only pizza and salad, so we got both and they were just average.   They have no \"signature\" pizzas, it's all build your own.   The topping selection was very limited, so we ordered a large pizza  1/2 with pesto and kalamata olives, and  1/2 with ham and pepperoni.   They charge you for toppings on the whole pizza even if you only get them on half which is a little ridiculous, but whatever.  I ordered a side of red sauce to dip my pesto pizza in.  It was watery and flavorless, it needed garlic and salt! The only thing I can say good about the pizza is they use fresh mozzarella, so it wasn't greasy.   The house red wine was decent and a good price by the carafe, overall they had a nice wine selection.   Our server was friendly and prompt, and the atmosphere was cozy.  We had a big party so we had a private room.  Needless to say, after spending $65 for mediocre pizza, wine and salad, this is not a venue we will choose to go back to.  If you want a great place to go for pizza and wine in Old Town, skip Grimaldi's and go to Grazie, you won't be disappointed!",

Nakita in catering was very easy to work with-- pleasant and efficient.  Jesse was put in charge of our party that night and did an incredible job!  He set the room, tended bar, served the food, bussed the tables and took care anything/everything else we needed (basically all by himself!!) that night.  I knocked off one star, as the food was a bit choppy in its arrival (not that big of a deal by the end of the evening, but the natives were definitely getting a little restless for a bit) and the manager on duty, Katherine, was neither very friendly nor very helpful. (Although she was not actually rude, there was definitely a bit of attitude when I asked for her help regarding the food, etc.)  But, as I said, all in all, Grimaldi's did a great job and, as always(!!) the food was delicious!!",

I'll never forget driving down Scottsdale Road in May 2006, days after I moved into town from Washington, DC and I saw the Grimaldi's sign.  I thought, \"Could it be?  Could Grimaldi's from Brooklyn actually have opened up a new location?!?\"  Sure enough, I learned that they sold the recipe to a company that is opening up franchises (something like that) of the pizzeria.  I was thrilled!  Tasted it and was even more thrilled to see it tasted so similar to the Brooklyn location.    I have been to four locations around the Valley and each one makes excellent thin crust coal burning oven pizza.  Totally top notch!  Best pizza in AZ hands down!    My favorite Grimaldi's pizza: Large with pepperoni, sausage, and basil (baked in).  Can't go wrong.  Also, their \"small\" salads are big enough to share.",

When you arrive, expect to have at least a 30 minute wait, if not longer.  The great thing is that they give a buzzer that looks like a pizza, so you can walk around nearby in Old Town or hit up a bar.  If you plan on eating an entire pizza, expect to have at least 3-4 people helping you.  Their slices are huge.  We got a pizza with red marinara sauce base along with onions, olives, and bell peppers.  The pizza came in about 20 minutes and it smelled incredible.  The pizza had a thin crust but a hearty taste.  The pizza size is enormous, so don't be thinking its a light pizza just because it is thin.  The service was fantastic even with a busy audience.  I would come here again with a small group of people and enjoy some pizza.",

    "text": "During a recent trip to Scottsdale, my husband and I were in the mood for anything but Mexican food as we had our fair share of Mexican cuisine our first few days in town. Hmmm... What should we have? What will hit the spot? Pizza, of course! Grimaldi's it is!  Grimaldi's is a casual pizzeria with a heavy Italian feel to it. Picture dark brick indoor walls, wine bottle chandeliers, red and white checkered tablecloths, and the amazing aroma coming from the coal-fired brick ovens. It was fairly crowded on the Saturday evening we dined here. Our server, though busy with several tables, kept our drinks full and a smile on her face the entire time.  Their menu consists of salads, pizzas, and calzones. My husband and I split a small caesar salad to start, and the small was still more than the two of us could finish. It was honestly one of the best caesars I'd ever had though. There is a bit of unexpected tanginess in the dressing that I simply loved. We then moved on to the main reason we were there... THE PIZZA!  They have an interesting way of ordering the pizzas. First you pick your size: 12, 16, or 18 inch. Then you pick your sauce: traditional tomato, pesto, or butter garlic. Finally, you pick your toppings. Each topping ranges in price from $2 - $4 and the price remains the same whether a topping is used for the entire pizza or only half. So if you're a deluxe pizza kind of person... you'll be paying for it. However, all ingredients are very fresh. They even make their mozzarella in-house and use their own secret recipe for the dough and sauces.   My husband and I went with a 16 inch, traditional sauce, half bacon (his) and half ricotta and black olive (hers). The crust was thin and crisp, the perfect amount of sauce was used, and the unique blend of melted ricotta blended with fresh slices of mozzarella and black olives was to die for. We both enjoyed our $8 worth of toppings very much!   Since Grimaldi's has many locations scattered throughout the U.S., I would definitely stop in again if I were near one. My only complaint is the a la carte pricing for each and every topping. The price can quickly escalate on your pizza if you're not careful, so choose wisely.",

    "text": "Let me start by disclosing that  I am NOT a fan of pizza. When I came here for a family function in their private room I was secretly hoping they would have salad. I was not disappointed. Everything on the buffet was good, from the salads to the pesto penne and penne vodka. When I went back for more penne vodka, all of the food had been devoured so we ordered a few pizzas. The pizza was good, although it wasn't the best pizza I've had. I prefer a thinner crust and more salt. I did like that it was not too heavy on tomato sauce and it was not greasy.  Now, the desserts were awesome. The tiramisu was delicious and the cannoli were so good I had three of them.  The place was pretty lively and if I lived in Phoenix I would definitely come here again.",

    "text": "3.5* but another *.5 for attentive, friendly service  I visited Grimaldi's with my daughter on Saturday (2/12) as sort of a last resort.  We were planning to try out Dozo, but my poor planning brought us to a closed-for-weekend-lunch venue more than thirty minutes from home.  Luckily DD was fine with pizza, so we found parking a couple blocks away and got a table outside (no wait).  The outdoor seating is mostly in the alley between two buildings, which causes a sort of wind tunnel.  It was chilly even with outside temps at 77 degrees.  Near the end of the meal, we did get a gas heater placed near us which was very welcomed.  The menu is simple, with calzones, pizza and salads.    We ordered a personal white with garlic pizza with 100% beef meatballs (according to the waitress) and ricotta cheese.  Yes, my daughter chose the toppings.  After ordering, the waitress brought my daughter some pizza dough to play with, which went over well (she loves doing this at Oregano's, as well).  It kept her occupied as we waited for our pizza.  The pizza arrived after about 20 minutes and it appeared even larger than the 12\" promised.  We dug in and found a crispy thin-ish crust and a very good topping ratio.  The garlic was light and enhanced the flavor of the toppings, rather than overpowering them.  All in all, a good pizza.    The waitress was friendly and visited our table just enough times to ensure my glass was always topped off.  She timed her visits perfectly, including stopping by with the check once we were clearly finished.  She was not, in any way, annoying.  That's always a plus in my book!  We had three slices of pizza left and DD asked me to bring them home \"in case we get hungry later.\"  Definitely a win from DD and I'd visit again for a quick bite.",

We were seated at a small 4-top in the middle of the room.  When we asked if we could sit at one of the empty tables by the window, the hostess told us no since we were a party of 4, and those tables were for 5.  Seriously?  All of the tables are empty.  We're talking one extra chair.  So of course when we ordered two pizzas and an appetizer, there was a space problem for the server.  As we were leaving, the hostess was advising another family they couldn't bring their stroller in because there wasn't enough space.  While that might hold True during busy times, there was plenty of space.  I can only assume this employee was working under management's policies.  Aside from that, I still think they have some of the best pizza around, although, we have gotten a soggy middle a few times since our first visit.",

As I walked in, the place was jumpin' with a nice crowd of families, couples and singles. I saddled up to the bar, met Karissa and promptly ordered a 12\" sausage, pepparoni and jalapena thin crust, coal fired pizza. SENSATIONAL is an understatement. I met the folks, got talkin' World Series baseball, business and life with the troops. After a bit I settled up my $21 tab and hit the road.

    "text": "Okay, so I have been to this Grimaldi's plenty of times over the years, but it was my most recent visit that pushed me to write a review. My husband and I had a super low key holiday season this year (which was pretty amazing by the way) and decided to go out for some pizza on Christmas Eve. We were pleasantly surprised that the place was pretty busy. There's nothing worse than eating in an empty restaurant...wouldn't you agree?  Anyway...we were greeted by a friendly hostess who quickly took us to one of the few open tables still available. She chatted with us as we walked and gave us an informative spiel as we sat down at our cozy spot by the kitchen. (Important sidenote: I love that you can watch the pizza-makers doing their thing.) Shortly thereafter, our server, Adrienne, came to greet us and take our order. She was super friendly and I knew immediately we were going to be receiving good service throughout our meal. Like I mentioned above, the place was busy and my husband and I watched as Adrienne went from table to table throughout the evening. She had several big tables at the time, yet never missed a beat. She was attentive, relaxed, and knowledgeable.    We started with a small salad which I think was a bit overpriced, even if it is a decent size. Then we moved on to a small cheese pizza. Grimaldi's \"small\" is a lot more like a medium so it was a good option for two of us. When Adrienne brought our pizza out she informed us that apparently our pizza wasn't as big as it should have been so the manager ordered us a personal sized pizza as well. A free pizza with our pizza? Don't mind if I do!   So I guess the point of this whole review is to make one major point...the service here is pretty awesome. And no, I haven't had the same service at other Grimaldi's locations. The Old Town location definitely seems a step above the other versions I've visited around town. Their atmosphere is better, it's always a bit busier, and it's officially been determined that the service here is way better than the majority of restaurants around town. If you're looking for a good pizza this is definitely a great option. Ask for Adrienne and add some olive oil to your pizza...I promise it will add up to a delicious meal. Enjoy!",

The consistency among the locations is something you can count on which is awesome!        Johnny was our server and was great! When we arrived the dining room was packed but we were seated with no wait. Johnny greeted us with a smile and took our drink order. I ordered a glass of the Ruffino Chianti but also asked for a taste of the house as I was curious of a $4.00 glass. He was very accommodating and with a smile. Needless to say, I'll stick with the Ruffino. LOL At this time you can see the restaurant is emptying out and servers are bustling around to wrap up with the exception of Johnny who still was waiting on guests. Must be the closer! This is when I noticed an area of service that lacked. Not for us personally but looking around you could see Johnny and one other server running their butts off while others visited in the corner by the bar or where going about their side work duties. No big deal but as a former industry manager myself I really appreciate it when I see teamwork during and after service. The food is always amazing and we love Grimaldis! We missed getting to visit with Brandon in the bar who is always great but maybe next time. Note: my boyfriend would love to be able to have a Vodka Soda here! Why no liquor??  Keep up the good work Grimaldis Old Town! Yummy!",

Didn't get to see the inside of the restaurant, as we were all seated out in the breezeway.  Servers were very nice and tolerant of our party of 25 or so.    My wife and I got a 1/2 carafe of red sangria- it was okay for the price (probably not worth $14 in retrospect).  We got an individual cheeze pizza and a small Caesar salad to split between us- it was a good portion for us.  Other people got \"small\" pizzas, and they were pretty big.  The pizza itself was really, really good.  Thin crust, crispy crust, light ricotta-style cheese on top.  More towards the flatbread end of the pizza spectrum, but it was very, very good pizza.  I'd definitely eat here again.  A little on the pricey side, but not terrible.",

Time and time again, I find Grimaldi's to be our standby pizza joint: perfect thin-but-chewy crust, topped with just the right amount of sauce and ingredients such that we can leave there having pigged out and yet feeling merely comfortably full. The house salad is simple yet perfect starter to lead in to the main event. Also, we are always able to get seated right away, thanks to people's inexplicable aversion to being sitting at the plentiful and generously sized high-top tables right through the front door.   Which leaves me with my only suggestion: please ensure that the new SQ location is putting out the same quality product! I hope the oven crew gets a handle on getting the crusts right eventually.",

My purpose is telling you this is because I felt the servings that were ordered and delivered were very generous and filling -- nobody went home hungry last night.  HOWEVER -- I felt the food was rather bland.....not bad, not terrible, just bland.  The pizzas did not have enough seasonings and even salt on them.  Normally the cheese is salty too, but not last night.  And the salad dressings, all three of them, were rather bland.....to me, there was enough olive oil in them, but not enough seasoning and vinegar.

Good drink selection, tasty salads, flavorful pizza (and I'm usually not a thin-crust fan, coming from Chicago), and friendly service.  It's always seemed busy in there, which I guess is a good thing which shows that others think highly of them as well, but we've never had to wait long to be seated.  We'll be back again soon.",

Whenever I walk into Grimaldis and see the red and white checkered tablecloths, the pizzas being made in front of your eyes, the bottles of wine going around and the red brick brightening up the place, it takes me back to my childhood days of classic pizza parlors, Friday night pizza and TGIF TV. The pizza here is large, doughy and pretty tasty. I normally go for the classic pepperoni and I like the pepperonis they choose. The pizzas don't run cheap but it could easily feed a family of four. The pizzeria has plenty of seating and at nighttime, the place will be hustling and bustling with everyone from the retired, to the date night couples to families out for a cheesy treat.   So this is a pizza parlor. Is it the best pizza in Phoenix? That's for you to decide. I think it's good, but pizza is pizza. If I could do 3.5 stars, I probably would, but it gets four because it's in a good location, the pizza leaves me happily satisfied and it provides a fun atmosphere if you want to feed your grease addiction and take it back to the Lady and the Tramp days (you know, when they eat the spaghetti and then kiss?) of amore in the Italiano pizza parlor environment.",

    "text": "I really don't require a whole lot from a pizza (or a pizza joint, for that matter).   You don't have to hand build yourself a big old brick oven, grind your own semolina wheat into flour, milk your own cows for the milk for the mozzarella and press your own olives into super duper virgin olive oil, to impress me.  I don't need for to you to have been blessed by Oprah or Jerry or any of their friends.  All I need is a well-made and high quality pie, friendly and comfortable surroundings, a glass or two of a nice cab or syrah and friendly service and smiling faces!  That's really pretty simple (but then, I am a simple man with simple needs...almost humble, really...and noted far and wide for my humility and modesty...I guess I would say \"renowned\").  But enough about me...let's talk pies!  Grimaldi's has 'em and a ton of people seem to like 'em!  Rightly so...they are terrific!  The Beautiful Carin and I wandered down to Grimaldi's last evening for dinner...split a Caesar, had a pie and couple of glasses of syrah...sat in the back, near the kitchen and watched the chef's hand toss the pies and stoke the oven with coal...All dark wood, red accents and black and white checked table cloths...just the way a pizza joint should be!  Time to share our weeks with each other and decide how we want our weekend to look...a lovely Friday evening ritual...what a great meal and a great way to slide into the weekend!  Tasty pizza dough, savory sauce and any pretty much any combination of cheese/no-cheese and high quality toppings that you could want, all baked to blistery perfection in the non-homemade coal fired brick oven!  For those of us who don't always like to be told what to do...we get to customize our pizza (and the wait staff doesn't look at you like you just pooped in your chair for having the temerity to attempt to have a pizza pie the way you want it, instead of the way the pizza pooh-bah thinks you should have it)...that's right...have it any way you want!  And yes, they get busy at Grimaldi's and you might have to wait from time to time, but the pleasant people who work the front of the house go out of their way to make you feel welcome and wanted!  * They give you pizza shaped pagers to let you know when they are ready for you, rather than telling you that you have to come find them every hour to find out if you are going be able to eat; * There are tons of things to do nearby (within easy walking distance) if there is a bit of a wait, as well as a terrific and reasonably priced full bar to enhance your appetite; * They give you reasonably accurate estimates of the wait time, so you can decide what you would like to do (as opposed to telling you the wait is \"2 hours\" and then telling you 4 hours later that they have run out of everything and they are done for the night...too bad for you)  In other words, Grimaldi's operates as a good restaurant should, providing an excellent product and wonderful and friendly service at very reasonable price points!  I understand that one's taste in pizza is subjective and \"who's best\" is the subject of nearly endless and tedious debate...I mean really tedious...I'm not going be the one to broker peace in our time in the never ending Pizza Wars.  For me, Grimaldi's is a slice of contentment, satisfaction and relaxation...I don't care who wins the Pizza Wars, as long as I can get a Friday night pie every week or two at Grimaldi's!",

Nothing left the kitchen unless it passed his inspection and met his high quality demands.  Made us happy knowing they cared so highly about their food.  Now for the cheesecake.  They make it in-house and it was the best cheesecake I have ever had.  The crust alone was perfection.  It melted in my mouth.  I could have eaten just the crust it was so good.  I ordered the blue berry cobbler cheesecake.   Whole berries were at the bottom of the cheesecake.   The consistency of the cheesecake was perfection.  The soft granola sprinkled on top for the \"cobbler\" feel was just the right crunch to balance this piece of heaven.  I don't know who their chef was but kudos!",

    "text": "Only 5 stars??  That's crap.  I wish they had a 10 stars because Grimadi's would easily get that.  Some may not agree with me and there was a point in my life when I thought differently.  A few years ago I had dinner at the Chandler location for the first time.  Yeah it was good, but it was your normal fancy pizza that I figured most trendy places are doing.  I don't know what changed from then until now.  I visited this location and we had a party of about eight people.  We all showed up and went to our table. Ordered drinks and quickly ordered the pizzas.  My girlfriend ordered us a pesto pizza with olives and mushrooms.  Others ordered various ones and when they brought them out, we went to town.  For years I've been a pizza lover and some of my favorite pizza places are even on here, but I gotta say that Grimaldi's is now my favorite pizza place I have ever been to.  I took a bite of that pesto pizza and almost fell off my chair.  I couldn't believe how good it was.  People make jokes at me sometimes because I get rediculous when it comes to good food.  Well, its because I love dining out and when the food and service is great, I get a little extra excited.  I also tried some of their sausage with cheese and couldn't seem to say no to more.  Quick note about their pizza.. it is THIN crust pizza.  Think Oregano's and NYPD Pizza had a kid and that kid became President.  That's Grimaldi's (at least in my book).  I had 4.5 slices..  yea yeah yeah.. but it was soooo good.  I even told our server \"dude, this is the best pizza I have ever eaten.\"  he patted me on the back and said \"Awe yeah, that's what we love to hear.\"  I can't wait to go back here again.    Thank you for an awesome time Grimaldi's!",

We felt the need to visit this place only days after getting back from NYC. the original is under the brooklyn bridge and we never ventured that way. as good as it is here, i cant imagine how fantastic it is in nyc with the water. completely reminiscent of the nyc style pies we had only days before from Lombardi's and John's Pizzeria... the first pizzeria in NY and the other on our pizza tour, respectively.   Outstanding. If setting reservations, call before 4pm. only knock of the star is the price for the pie. It seemed priced the same as i'd expect of the nyc city location despite being in az. Even the pie's we had at John's and Lombardi's, in East village and Little Italy in Manhattan were priced more competitively then this.",

    "text": "Excellent pizza.  Stopped in for dinner a couple of days ago.  Seated quickly.  Attentive waiter.    Small pizza (pepperoni & sausage) with a lovely glass of red wine.  I was seated near the pizza oven and got to watch the guys making my pizza.  Fresh balls of dough hand stretched into the crust.  Plenty of toppings, cheese and just the right amount of sauce.  Coal fired oven was glowing red hot, pizza going in, out.  Time from being pulled from the oven, to being at the table was seconds.  The wait staff were lined up to deliver the pizza to the tables quickly.     My pizza was done perfectly.  One of the best I've had in a very long time.  I got to watch other folks ordering and eating, and they all had a satisfied look on their faces.  Clearly this is a local favorite.  Families, people out for a date, folks like me who just wandered in - all seemed pleased with their meals.  Place did get busy about 20 minutes after I got there, so I imagine if you go at peak times, there will be a wait.    Grimaldi's doesn't try to be all things to all people.  It does pizza, calzone and a couple of salads - and does them very well.  The wine list is reasonably inclusive and not over priced.  Plenty of seating inside and out.  Prices were reasonable.  Place was clean.  Service was excellent.  Total for the wine and more pizza than I could eat by myself, was $27.    Bottom line - Excellent pizza.  Go try it.  It's worth a visit.",

We waited forever for our waiter to come back to take our order, our water glasses were empty more often than full, and the food took too long. We had ordered a beer with the pizza and we each ate two pieces before we told another staff member to cancel the beer. We waited again to get our check and for them to pick it up. The food wasn't anything special. Then the manager came over as we were getting our check to ask how everything was right next to the waiter. He was walking away as he asked the question so clearly he didn't care.  I wouldn't go again.",

Got here 7:30 Sunday and got seated right away. Went with some friends who had been here before so trusted their suggestions.   Don't overload your pizza here there is no need. Pick 2 things and let the ingredients do their thing.  My brain didn't process until just now how pricey this actually was. A large pizza, shared large salad, two waters, two sodas $43 whoa?!? But whatever good food is what it is.  Onto The Food!  White Pizza: We went with Italian sausage and roasted red peppers. Liked the sausage, was sliced whole verses crumbled. Mass amounts of garlic on this pizza which I'm fine with. Donno how I would feel about taking a date here. One thing I didn't like was the garlic was the jarred variety, you can tell by the slight vinegary flavor. The mozzarella was a dry variety but kept the pizza from getting soggy, points for that. Olive oil was smokey, nutty, strong and EVO I'm sure. The roasted red peppers were light and very sweet.  Mediterranean Salad: Yep.. this was a salad :p Nothing super special but it did the job.",

My friend is pretty much a vegetarian and does eat chicken so we ordered a veggie/chicken pizza...omg! God awful. There was barely any cheese on there and had no real flavor, the crust was horrible. We asked the server if we could add some cheese to the pizza we had in front of us and she said that for \"health reasons\" they could not put the pizza back in the oven...stupid!! She urged us to order another pizza with extra cheese and the same toppings...who does that??? So, thinking that it would be better, we did so, (they did comp the first one we ordered) and still a horrible mistake. It was soggy and still had no taste but with more cheese. My friend and I have literally had better pizza in a hole in a wall place by the night clubs in Old Town Scottsdale. The only thing that made this place bearable was the wine...we will never again try this place...I mean they didn't even have any music playing...no real ambiance, food was awful and service was terrible.

    "text": "Overpriced bread with a dearth of toppings combined with a frumpy and frugly manager named Lauren makes the old town Scottsdale location a 1 star experience.    If I could give Lauren minus 4 stars I would!   After 20+ pizzas, let me share my experiences - this is simply another overpriced \"chain\" restaurant:  First the toppings: ... If you want anything besides carbs and bread this isn't your place.   Second the service: ...The entire staff acts as if they are doing you a favor taking your order or bringing your food.  It is not unusual to order a pizza \"to go\" and walk in to find no one at the bar.  This would be OK sans the fact that the hostess, manager and other wait staff look at you and then proceed to stand around and pick their nose until whomever has the bar comes back from their conversation with their co-workers or whatever they are doing NOT behind the bar. This typically involves checking their cell phone in the area between the bar and dining room near the patio door where I am going to guess there are no video cameras.   Third the pizza: ... All the people \"raving\" about this place are the same people spending 12 hours a day on facebook... the same people who need to be part of the \"in\" crowd.  I call them sheep or sheeple.... Sbarros at the mall has better pizza. PizzaME! has better pizza. Even the chipotle of pizza (mypie) has significantly better pizza.  There is nothing special about thin bread with a tiny amount of sauce and tiny pepperoni's.  I guess you'll  \"rave\" about toppings when you only get 3 per slice if you are an idiot.    I am sure it is a great business because their portion allocation is absurd. You mean you want cheese AND toppings AND sauce on your pizza. What do you think this is a pizza place ??    Now for Ms. Lauren: Dear Lauren.  Thank you for taking the time to \"educate me\" on exactly how much ricotta cheese should be on my pizza.  If you had anything more than a moderate education, you would have looked up my phone number and seen that I've ordered the exact same pie no less than 12+ times in the past year!   Yes I can clearly see half of the pizza has a tiny crumble of ricotta cheese. I'll post the photo here for your boss to see.  FYI Lauren, my vision is perfect. Its actually 20/15 (better than 20/20) and I have the cognitive powers to recognize when someone in the kitchen messed up.  I totally appreciate calling in my order and then waiting 8 minutes for you to arrive with my extra topping to lecture me about your staff's problem....  as if I somehow called the order in because I wanted to wait 20 minutes to pickup a \"to go\" order and listen to your frugly, frumpy attitude at 2:30 in the afternoon when you don't even have 4 tables occupied.  It's a fun waste of my time telling me how the pizza is correct when I am the person buying and eating it.  I've only talked to 3 other managers who have all said it's not problem if you need more cheese.  I guess they are all wrong and so I am... You are right Lauren.  Go ahead and threaten to \"charge me extra\" next time.  That just ensures there will be no next time and maybe management will fire your frumpy butt and hire back more attractive and sociable managers who don't argue with customers over 30cents in toppings....  Did I mention the furgly and frumpy?  When you get fired please go start a restaurant chain called \"frugly and frumpies\".  I hereby grant you the trademark to the name. I am sure you'll fill the house with your awesome persona.    Then when people order, you can threaten them with extra charges as if you are doing them a favor after they have signed the check.  Brilliant idea.  You'll go far in life.  And hopefully that is far away from Scottsdale.",

LIttle did I know i was about to encounter the WORST customer service I've ever received in my entire life. We were a party of 16 and you would already expect a party of 16 to be a little loud. They had already placed us outside when we had requested inside but we understood due to the size of the party. As we are sitting there and everyone is arriving a party of two has already complained about our noise level. Not only was this party done eating but they had decided to stare us down. We had waved at her and she then decided to come over to our table and instigate a confrontation. Calling us children and that our money was irrelevant because it had come from our parents. The funny thing is that we all have jobs, college scholarships, and are legally adults. I have never seen an adult act so childish in my entire life. I was appalled. The manager had then asked us to leave because this women had decided to cause a scene. The irony of this actually makes me laugh. Anyways we also were told we had to pay for our meals as well. So as mature people would do, we complied. We then preceded to Sauce where the customer service was 100x better. Go figure. I will be speaking to someone higher up in this establishment and i will not be back until this manager has been fired. No guest should be treated this way. If you want italian food in Old Town, I highly recommend Buca Di Beppo. The customer service and food is better anyway. This establishment does not deserve any business until they learn how to treat guests properly.",

    "text": "On my fourth visit to Grimaldi's something amazing happened. I decided to try the pesto pizza, took one bite and POW! I was blown away! This pizza place was already out of this world awesome in my mind but after tasting their pesto pizza, Grimaldi's officially won a pizza my heart.  Grimaldi's is a genuine, high-quality pizza joint that oozes class. By no means is it an over the top cheese ball pizza parlor packed to the brim like Oreganos. Instead, this place is so basic that it's luxurious. At Grimaldi's, less is more. It is quite simple really, as their menu doesn't have much on it except for pizza, salad and wine. However, I've come to find that basic/limited menus are always a good sign because that means a restaurant can specialize and perfect a specific item, and in Grimaldi's case, that item is authentic NY style pizza.  Inside, it can get very loud and very busy. On the weekends, waiting for a table can take forever but the wait is 100% worth every second. And even though this place gets packed to the brim, once you grab a table it doesn't feel packed. There is enough spacing in between tables to where you don't feel squished. The red brick interior and awesome framed photos that adorn the walls really bring this place to life.  The pizzas here don't come cheap but I'm telling you they are undoubtedly worth the higher price tag and the longer wait. With the freshest toppings and endless make your own pizza combinations, you really can't go wrong with the menu at Grimaldi's. Their crust is also to die for, and that's probably because of their amazing pizza oven and pizza chefs!  Every single time I've been here, the service has been spectacular. Yes, it has taken longer than I would have liked for a pizza to arrive at my table but the wonderful thing about the servers at Grimaldi's is that they don't ignore you or try to avoid you if your waiting a long time to receive your food (due to the fact that they are packed). Instead, they update you on your order and acknowledge the fact that the kitchen is running behind. Their customer service skills make all the difference.  Recently, Matt's company decided to throw their Christmas party in one of their event rooms, and the wait staff did an outstanding job. They were friendly, accommodating and at the end they even packaged all the extras for people to take home because there was sooooooo much food! I also have to note that they have multiple rooms for larger parties, and the cost to hold an event in one of their rooms (complete with catering and an open full bar, whoo hoo!) is EXTREMELY affordable and a total steal for what you get. I highly recommend hosting an event at Grimaldi's!  Overall, I love that Grimaldi's brings a little taste of authentic New York to Scottsdale with their superior service and exceptionally tasty food.",

I went there with one of my friends, and we ordered a pizza together along with some drinks.  After we had our pizza in front of us, I asked for some ranch.  Oh, I should not have asked.  They made such a big deal, as if I insulted their cooking.  I'm just a girl who happens to like ranch and pizza, no matter how good it is.  Am I not allowed to have my own likes and dislikes?  Anyway, they refused to give me ranch with my pizza and claimed it's because it drowns out the True flavor of the pizza.  So what??  Their job isn't to tell me how I SHOULD like my food based on their own preferences.  This was a truly awkward and uncomfortable experience, when it should have been a fun and pleasant night with a good friend.  I couldn't even enjoy my pizza, because I felt like I was being judged the rest of my meal there, just for asking a simple question.  I'd rather make my own pizza at home, than to feel treated like that again.",

    "text": "This is the best pizza I've had in Arizona since moving here ten years ago. Where's the second best? Fugetaboutit, it doesn't matter, Grimaldi's has ruined all other pies for me.  It's not cheap but you cannot beat the crispy thin crust or real deal mozzarella cheese, this ain't no bag of shredded cheese on your pizza, it's the good stuff. Our favorite is a caprese style pie where the basil is added after cooking. Try it, you'll like it. Another plus is the fact they have sliced meatball topping, not ground beef. They make the balls, cook them, cool and slice. That's the only way to put beef on a pizza pie.  It doesn't matter which location you go to, the quality of service and food is tops in San Tan, Chandler, Scottsdale or Peoria. I cannot say enough good things about Grimaldi's",

I explained the situation to the server (no big deal, just didn't want to be charged for a topping I didn't get) and he immediately apologized and offered to fix my pizza. He came back about 10 seconds later and said he would just give me a new pizza with my correct order. Then, the manager came over, apologized profusely and confirmed that I would be getting a free pizza. On top of everything else, they discounted my bill by half. So, I got twice the pizza for half the price over a very minor mistake!  Best customer service ever!",

    "text": "So happy this worked into this visit to Scottsdale! We had tried the Far North Scottsdale location last year when we visited and I FELL IN LOVE...no joke, I would have it shipped to my home in MN if I thought it would travel well. But, alas, the best thing about coal-fired pizza is that you don't want to travel any distance or in any rush....just slowly take in the aroma and the flavour....and, if you're a fan of libations, a Peroni washes this down nicely at lunch as does a deep Cab Sauv at night :) I'm always happy to find red-and-white tablecloths in a pizza parlour....maybe sounds cheesy (ha!), but it just puts a smile on my face! The lunchtime hostess at this location was really excited about her job, the food, and the weather - what a great smile she has and how very welcoming she was that day for this party of one! I sat in the bar, was greeted promptly by a great waitress who knew exactly how much time to allow for decisions, and I ordered a personal pizza with 'choke hearts and kalamata olives. It came to the table sliced into 6 pieces and I honestly could have been finished after 2....but why would I deprive myself while on vacation? DUH! So, I ate a third slice and took half of the pizza back to our condo for a future snack.....lucky future snack tummies unite! Do your family a favor and take them to Grimaldi's :()",

We had all had a little too drink before hand and a long wondering around looking for some mysterious place and decided this would do fine. Pizza sounded great.   This is definitely a family place and very, very, very loud. That served us well because my friend kept getting into a drunken argument with our other friend and was not using family friendly language.   The food itself underwhelmed. I love pizza and have grown up with some amazing pizza places near me. The sauces this place had sounded delicious, and it was thin crust which is o so delicious. However what killed me was that you get the sauce and cheese and that is it for free. Every topping costs no less then $4. $4 for a topping! Are you kidding me? Even the fanciest pizza place I love back home gives you two toppings for free, and then charges you at most $2 depending on the topping. I felt like it was highway robbery to pay that much for toppings, but held my tongue.   When the pizza came I have to say it was good, but not great. The flavors were there, but not in a BAM way. It was a decent pizza but lacking a lot of umph and punch.   Overall it was forgettable meal at a very unforgettable price.",

I came back to this establishment yesterday, May 13th for lunch with a friend. We arrived at 11:30am and we were what seemed to be the first customers of the day.   We sat down at the bar and a dark haired woman who apparently was the bartender brought us menus. I do not know her name because she did not tell us when she greeted us.   My friend and I both ordered waters to start because we had been outside all morning in 100 degree Arizona heat. The bartender brought us dinner menus. When I asked for the lunch menu she told me \"Grimaldis doesn't offer a lunch menu.\"  When the bartender came back to take our order I tried to make friendly conversation by asking why the restaurant was so dead. She gave me unnecessary attitude and seemed annoyed with both my friend and I while taking our orders.   Immediately after she put the orders into her computer she printed us a receipt and walked over and placed it in front of us not saying a word. I was planning to buy a beer to go with my lunch and felt very offended at her actions.   As we sat there waiting for our food all we could think and talk about was how uncomfortable and awkward this bartender was making us feel. We had had enough and decided to end the experience before the food was delivered to the table.   When we left I called another Grimaldis on the other side of town and asked if they offered a lunch menu and she told me that they do.   I understand people have bad days and sometimes you just aren't in the mood for small talk but lying about what your restaurant offers is unacceptable. I don't think I will be returning to this establishment.",

Then it took 20 minutes for a server to come and she had just happened to walk by as our table wasn't hers.   So we ordered right away.  Meanwhile another couple had just been seated and were going over the menu.  Well, their pizza came 10 minutes before ours did!  When we finally got our pizza and started eating, it took 15 minutes to get our servers attn to refill our drinks while she was busy filling others and chatting.  If the pizza wasn't so good...perfect ingredients, the thin crust almost perfect except soft in the middle, we'd be coming here more often!  I'll reevaluate later and give it more stars for their pizza...til then...",

First off the hosts were a disaster, I came to ask if I could put my name down and received a blank stare. Later on I asked for a perfect Manhattan. The bartender asked me what I wanted it made with, SoCo, Bourbon, Canadian...What? I am thinking to myself. I told him I would have Bourbon, followed by instructing him on what the implication of the prefix perfect in my drink meant (thats half sweet and half dry Vermouth). As I was starting to tell him the meaning of perfect he told me he knew what it was. Eventually he made and served my drink, on the rocks which I had not specified. My mom and I split a greek salad, which was well sized considering it was not the large size. It needed more olives and feta and especially more red onion. My mom and I asked if we could split a pizza without a fee for splitting the pie. The bartender said it would be no problem, but when he brought the bill he charged us. I will NOT be going back anytime soon.",

Grimaldi's is unlike any pizza I've ever had from anywhere in the valley. And yes, I've been to New York City and had their pizza. I'd pick Grimaldi's pizza over NYC pizza anyday. We've always had fantastic waiter's each time we go and I don't think we've ever had to wait. Parking in Old Town can be really bad at times, but we've never had to park far away either. It's always been a perfect experience. In comparison to say, Olive Garden, it's cheaper! I would recommend Grimaldi's to anyone in AZ, or visiting AZ. There are more locations in the valley and I haven't tried the others, but I'm guessing it's just as good. I haven't been hungry enough after chowing down on pizza to try any of the desserts, but one of these days I'm going to try their cannoli's.  This is spoken from someone who is 100% Italian. I'm choosing Patsy Grimaldi's for my Valentine's Day dinner spot!",

I believe Blaine was our primary server, he did an amazing job. I didn't catch the name of the young lady that was helping him, but she worked her tail off too. Food was out of this world good!

Offers up the mean common denominator on what you may expect.   I've been coming here regularly for almost a year and at first I thought it was just the tired staff in the early evening for their \"can't-wait-to-get-off-shift\" approach. But, it's the same tired staff month after month. Nothing's changed.   I'm not so critical that I won't order food; the experience is average. But the group chooses this as the venue for monthly meetings, so here I go.",

Lot's of places to go to and a nice downtown feel to the entire location. We didn't have to wait at all to be seated and our waitress was fantastic. We ordered a large pizza half pepperoni and half chicken and garlic. We also got a house salad I also ordered a glass of chardonnay (it paired well). The pizza was really good! I tried both types that we ordered and it tasted nice and fresh with a lot of taste in them. The place is fantastically well maintained and the water was good too. I even had room for dessert and I ended up ordering a cannoli. The cannoli was mouth watering fantastic. It was so good I wanted to order another one! Overall, fantastic spot with a good ambiance, service and food!",

The pizza is mediocre and pricey, the salads are decent but nothing to write home about, and the drinks are just drinks. There are tons of other great places in Scottsdale to go for pizza and drinks. With that being said if you are in the area and craving pizza Grimaldi's will do just fine.",

The servers are really cheerful and courteous and quick with a quip when we were cracking jokes with them. personally if you're going with the crowd is probably better to get the 12 inch personal Pizza because it comes out a lot quicker than the 16 or full size pie. Really good appetizers but the pizza really stands out and that's really we should go on. It almost reminds me of New Haven style pizza with a little bit of New York Brooklyn style kicked in there. Not a thick crust not too thin but a nice crisp finish. The toppings are really fresh and probably some of the best sauce I've had in quite a while.  if you're in the area and have a hankering for something other than southwestern food check out Grimaldi's because they're definitely a class above and I believe you can even get uber eats which is definitely worth it.",

We went from standing up against the glass counter out of the walk space to standing in the hallway leading to the bathroom where we were bumped into 3 times because we were actually standing in the way there.   That's strike 3 for me. 3 bad customer experience experiences warrant them never getting my money again. Ridiculous.",

The service was unimpressive - in fact it was pretty evident the waitress wasn't aware of the occasion we were celebrating, and only came back a few times so we were waiting, waiting, waiting to pay the bill. The restaurant was getting a little busier by the time we left, but it still wasn't a full house.   We should have asked for outdoor seating because the inside was so cold, my husband had to go out and get his jacket..   We ordered their Marghertia which in our opinion \"sucked\". It lacked the balance others have with the sauce/cheese/basil. The basil was muted, the cheese was understated and the sauce was overwhelming.. so much that it made the pizza little soggy at the center. Margherita is usually hands down my favorite, so this was disappointing.   Luckily, we also ordered the Brooklyn Bridge which was way better.. if I did for some reason come back this is all I would order.   I was hoping to find a nice salad to order to go with the meal, but nothing really stood out as being all that tempting.. in fact aside from the pizza nothing really grabbed me.   The waitress asked if we wanted one or two boxes to pack up our pizza, and since we had over half of each left we asked for two. What we got were two tiny boxes and the pizza stacked up on each other.. not quite what I had in mind because it made it very soggy for heating up at home. They may as well have thrown it in a bag.. how frustrating.   I'm not exactly dying to come back.. Arizona has way better pizza joints around.",

Not bad, but definitely not amazing. The slices are HUGE. And even on a slow lunch time midweek, it took forever to get our pizza. Middle of the pizza looked cooked on the bottom but was soggy. Glad we ordered a salad, and that was ok as well. The vinegrette was not very vinegary on the Mediterranean salad. The best piece of my meal was the tiramisu. It's been a couple hours since we ate and I'm not feeling to good :/",

So now that I live out west, I always wonder if it will be the same? Honestly, from my imperfect memory, it isn't quite, but it is still FANTASTIC! The sausage and pepperoni pizza is the best. And if you want legitimate cannoli cream, this place has it. As good as east coast bakeries. At this specific location, I love that while you wait, you can enjoy a beverage outside. Great place, great service, great memories!",

We went in the evening on a weekday, so the restaurant was more on the empty side. We decided to sit outside to take in the warm evening. It was nice having good background music--it was eclectic and fun, and wasn't too loud or too quiet. And despite coming near closing, the service was fantastic. Our server was extremely attentive and funny. The food was excellent. We ordered a house salad to split and a large pizza with mushrooms, sausage, and peppers. The salad was really yummy--great dressing and  flavorful greens (not just a bunch of bland iceberg lettuce). The pizza had a very thin crust and high quality toppings. Our only complaint was as you got towards the center of the pizza, the crust got soggier and soggier. Would have liked it to be cooked just a hair longer. Other than that, we had a great time at Grimaldi's. Would definitely recommend if you're in the area!",

There was a table waiting for us (he scored points for getting there early) and our waitress came by almost instantaneously. A+ customer service!  The pizzas are made to order and you have your choice of toppings. No pre-made creations here--you are the creator! After much contemplation we opted for the traditional pizza with mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes.  The crust was perfection, although they could've been more generous with the sauce.    There was a nice wine selection and the waitress gave a refreshingly honest opinion to help me decide. We could've easily split a salad, but we were daring and ordered two varieties--both were pleasers.    There's nothing like excellent pizza, good wine, and a crisp salad while enjoying the company.  What can I say?  He received the first kiss early in the evening.",

We had spent the whole afternoon hiking, and were ready to settle down for some pizza - and they had the highest Yelp ratings. Other than the wait, this was a great experience. And we knew there'd be a wait - we're from the city, it was Saturday night, and it was Spring Training in downtown Scottsdale... we knew what we were in for.  When we were seated, our waitress took great care of us. She got us a ton of water, talked about how they do pizza there, and was quick and attentive. We made a pretty quick decision on a basic salad and a nice pizza, and I don't know if it was hunger or really just delicious pizza, but we managed to kill that food in no time.  Overall, the pizza is thin and crispy, just how I like it. You have to build your own, which can get kind of expensive, but it was definitely worth it. We had a great view of the open kitchen, and we knew when our pizza was being made. It was a bit loud, due to the crowd, but it felt alive. Sometimes, the noise is overwhelming; here, it just seemed right.  We'll likely stop at Grimaldi's every time we visit Scottsdale in the future. The location makes it fun and a little touristy, but the food is definitely worth it.",

We had called ahead for a reservation but they don't take any.  But the girl assured us that it was hardly crowded and there shouldn't be more than 15m of a wait, especially if we came by soon.  Great! We would be there in less than 30 minutes.  WHOA! did things changes in that little time.  I walked in and found out that not only was it PACKED,  there was a 40 minute wait.  And that really soured me on the experience, because I felt a little duped.  But I guess it is possible that a mass of people showed up in 20 minutes.  It happens......(not really).  But otherwise, the meal was pretty good!  The pizza is super good, with a wonderful thin crispy crust.  I can't believe I had never been to this place before.  I will need to come back for sure!  And apparently, they don't offer anything fun for your birthday.  We mentioned that it was my Mom's birthday, in passing, and the waiter shrugged it off.  He did give us a card that she could fill out for her next birthday to get a free pizza. Who remembers the coupon 1 year later?  Pretty lame.",

My boyfriend's brother, ball player a.k.a. the king of twitter, does what he knows best and asks his 80,000 followers where to eat. After more than enough responses, Grimaldi's is the clear winner, especially after I make him throw in the \"gourmet, wood-fire\", etc words.  Honestly, some of the best pizza I've had in my life if not EVER. Amazing, thin, bubbly crust is topped with whatever you please and cooked to perfection in a brick-coal oven. We went with the whole family and Grimaldi's managed to wow all of us which is hard to do with such a diversely opinionated bunch as ours. My favorite was the one I picked out of course: a tomato sauce pie with pepperoni, mushroom, artichoke hearts, and ricotta.

No waiting because I sat in the bar area with tall stools. (No one else wanted to sit here).  My house salad has arrived. It looks so much better than the usual bowl of lettuce with one small tomato slice I get at most places. In fact, the bowl is so large that I know I'll have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. It comes with mushrooms, green olives, cherry tomatoes and peppers. Definitely NOT your average house salad. Me likey! :-)  I ordered the 18\" pizza with ground beef. It was good, but I prefer a thicker pizza crust. I also ordered a piece of butterscotch cheesecake. That was also good, but I would have preferred the peppermint cheesecake that they were out of. I crave white cheesecake with a flavored topping. This butterscotch cheesecake was butterscotch colored and flavored throughout. Not my favorite, I've decided it would have tasted better had it also been free for my birthday. ;-)  Thank you, Grimaldi's for my free birthday pizza. I'll be back next December.",

Haven't been to the original Brooklyn location but a friend of mine believes this location to be very close in taste and quality to the original.  Personal 12\" pies start at $9, but that's pretty much with nothing other than tomato sauce and cheese on it so you are going to have to shell out a little more for some extra toppings.  I decided to go with pepperoni, ricotta cheese, and garlic -- it was a fantastic and very delicious combo.  Also tried a slice from friends' \"white pizza with garlic\" and other toppings.  The white pizza does not include the sweet red tomato sauce as it would suggest.  The white pizza was good, but I would definitely say the regular pizzas that include the tomato sauce taste a little better and hit more on the savory and sweet parts of the palate.   I'm starting to salivate thinking about their pizza again!",

Pro's Pizza had a great, bubbly crust Ingredients were fresh Service was good Great wine selection, tons of affordable botles   Con's The menu has no pizza suggestions, (margarita, meat lover whatever) just cheese and then you choose your toppings and pay for each. That makes for a pricey pizza ahould you order a lot of toppings.   Red checkered tablecloths and big band music reminded me to much of Oregano's.   Overall it was a decent experience, but with so many pizza places in the valley I'm not sure I'd  go out of my way to return.",

The only downside is that there is usually a long wait to be seated, and then once your seated, it takes a longer wait for your pizza. The prices are average, the service was so-so, but the food was excellent! Nice location too, right in Old Town so you can have a drink at a nearby bar while you wait for your table. Cool place for date-night, or to have dinner with family. It's fairly casual, but charming at the same time.",

The young lady who greeted us at the door was so over it - definitely not the type you want giving a first impression to guests, she seemed like she could have cared less about anything, except perhaps her cell phone and getting the hell out of there.  Once we were seated however, our server made up for the angsty girl at the door.  Our server was fun and friendly.  We ordered a house salad to split and it was really good - fresh and full of tasty things - covered in a really fresh house dressing.  For our pizza we ordered a veggie pizza and at the servers urging added garlic powder and oregano.  Quite frankly - our pizza was bland - really bland and we were disappointed the crust was delicious but the pizza itself was bland. We think maybe it was the veggie pizza - but doctoring it up with garlic powder and oregano made it much better.   All in all it was a pleasant enough experience and I would go back - but the pizza was a bit of a let down - we will try a different flavour next time.",

The pizza was much better than I remember.  Instead of a soggy mess with the middle falling apart, the crust was crispy and dry.  I was actually able to cut and eat it with a knife and fork, although I prefer to eat with my hands.  The chicken sausage has some spice to it, but it went well with the mushrooms.  There was a 45 min wait when we put our name down, but we were called 20 min early.  The 16 inch was a little large for 2 people (6 pieces), so I would order a smaller pizza next time.

My husband gets a small white pizza with black olives and pepperoni and I get a personal size white pizza with ricotta cheese. Be wary of the sizes here, everything is HUGE! A small pizza is the size of a Pizza Hut large, so if you're trying to get your own pizza, go for the personal size with the expectation that you will have leftovers.  Their salads are also amazing. The caesar is a crowd fave in my home, as is the spinach. They are lovely additions to your meal if you want to make yourself feel better about scarfing pizza.  The only downside to Grimaldi's, which is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5, is their curbside pickup. It is incredibly hit or miss. There are some instances where a server is outside at our car within seconds of us pulling up, there are times where we sit in our car for up to 10 minutes just gazing into the window in their door wondering when someone will come out to say hello. It seems like the curbside pickup must not be a very popular job to have to do for the servers because on multiple occasions we've made eye contact with 2 or 3 people who still don't acknowledge us or come outside, and other times when we've witnessed 2 servers will get into a tiff about who has to come greet us. It's kind of a disaster.  Other than that, the service is usually awesome. The bartenders are all very nice and attentive, and the food is just darn good.",

    "text": "We live a short walk from Old Town Scottsdale and have eaten here several times.  Pizza is typically good and service is typically average.  Last night we stopped in and were advised the wait was 20-30 minutes.  Luckily there was a spot at the bar so we settled in to have a drink or two as we waited.  The bartender (a woman of 25-30 with blonde hair) was unbelievably rude.  It was clear when we sat down she was not a pleasant person by the look on her face while we waited to get served.  Unfortunately this is just the worst example of what is clearly lacking training and management of the staff at this location.  I have been in the food service business for years and currently count many Phoenix/Scottsdale's restaurants as my clients.  I may be overly sensitive to this because I have been in the biz but if your bartenders can't be pleasant and helpful, what can customers expect from the rest of your staff?  We didn't offend this person in any way as we only interacted with her for maybe 30 seconds before we walked.  There are many good restaurants within walking distance where the staff are either inherently nice or have been trained how to interact with customers.  At Grimaldi's they are not either.  We explained our experience to the hostess and host at the front as we told them to take our name off the wait list.  They just looked at us like deer in the headlights.  No apology or effort to recover.  Hopefully they passed it on to the manager so maybe the bartender could be counseled before they lose more customers.  We don't expect to go back for some time if ever.",

    "text": "If you know about New York pizza, you might be familiar with Grimaldi's and Juliana's pizza in Brooklyn. The history is kind of interesting as both shops were opened by Grimaldi but his original shop was sold and he opened up Juliana's, basically in the next building over.  Juliana's was the best pizza I've ever had and I've been eager to try Grimaldis to see how it stacks up.   In short, it doesn't disappoint! Right from when you walk in, your teleported to Brooklyn (and out of that Arizona heat!)  The dining room is open and inviting, well lit with wine bottle chandeliers adding a nice touch.   I had the Margherita pizza here as I wanted to compare the pizza with my experience in Brooklyn. Golden-brown crust, dallops of mozzarella spread evenly thought out the pie with a layer of vibrant red sauce, all topped with basil. It was love at first sight, and smell! The aroma that hits you is unbelievable.   The first and every bite is just as incredible. The crust is light crispy and flavorful but still strong enough to carry the toppings. The sauce absolutely makes this pie. The sauce is rich with the acidity and sweetness of tomatoes, hints of garlic and other herbs. The creaminess of the fresh mozzarella is the perfect compliment. The basil sprinkled on top adds a nice pop of brightness to it all.   Since Grimaldi's is a now a franchise, I wasn't sure it could compete with Julian's. Although I can't say it's better, it's as every bit as good. Lucky for me, theres a California location nearby. Excuses me while I go order the entire menu.",

    "text": "Just left Grimaldi's on Tuesday, 8/27 for dinner. I had an...interesting time.  My waitress, Alyssa, deserves 5 stars. She was sweet, on the ball and great overall. Food was good as always as well. I'd like to address the floor manager tonight.  To be plain and simple - this guy is a jerk. My 4 year old brother was with me at dinner. Now, I understand that kids can be a pain during dinner service. I worked industry through college, I get it. My problem is that this guy made us feel so unwelcome and now I won't be coming back. My brother wasn't screaming, running around the restaurant or throwing food. What was his big screw up? Tossing a crayon 2 feet on the floor as the manager was walking past. The guy picked up the crayon and walked over to the bar - crayon was never seen again. Who the hell takes a crayon away from a 4 year old child?  My brother's pizza was taking a pretty long time, so we asked our waitress how much longer it would be. Her answer?  \"I thought my manager came to talk to you - your brother's pizza came out a little too crispy so we had to refire a new one.\". Nope - manager didn't say a single word to us about this. No quality checks, no apology for burning a kid's food and he literally took a crayon away from a child.  Alyssa was great tonight. The manager tonight? Terrible customer service from him. I won't be back after the way a 4 year old child was treated.",

    "text": "\"The off night\" I am a regular to the Grimaldi establishments in Las Vegas. And I really give a one star for anything but this was a series unfortunate events that lead to the score. Is it fixable? Yes. Was it preventable? Totally.   Large party of 17 with children ranging from 4 to 16. 8 adults. We didn't get our drink orders, so we went to the bar and got our own. No biggie. The server took our order and we assumed that he knew what he got everything. Not the case. The salads came out and they were good, until the birds in the trees that we were sitting under started pooping on us, . That out of their control, but if it's an issue that occurs, you put a screen above and over an area where food will be served. The pizza comes out. We quickly realize that two of the orders were not filled. So we tell the server. 15 to 20 minutes go by and one of the pizzas come out and it's under-cooked. Now 30 minutes go by and the other families are all done. The family that was missing their pizza has two little children. The father was so fed up he left. Really put a damper on the evening.    All of this is fixable. We did inform the manager. And he was apologetic. We hope that they make the fixes and improve. We love Grimaldi's!",

I love Grimaldi's pizza though, and I'd pretty much put up with anything for it.  We ordered an 18-inch pie, which was enough for three ladies. We also got a small caesar salad. Some of the romaine was wilted and brown, not the freshest I've had. The pizza was excellent. We had a couple slices left over, and I thought it was a little odd that our server wrapped them up in a plastic bag instead of putting them in a box, but whatever.  The pizza is five stars, but I dock this location for wilty greens and sub-par service.",

The service was quite good. Except my end of the table hadn't been served a water or asked if we wanted drinks for about half an hour.  Taste: The pizza tasted great with all those topping choices available. The 18\" pizza is great for 2-3 people  Pricing:  Prices is relatively expensive. For the pizza in our photo, it came out to about $40  Verdict: I would go here for special occasions like birthdays, graduations, anniversaries, but probably not as an everyday meal.",

My server, Caroline, was friendly and attentive as I ordered a 16\" traditional pizza with kalamata olives (note: these may and do contain pits). My pizza didn't take too long to arrive and the size of the slices were generous. I liked the thin crust and the bountiful toppings, they did not skimp on those olives.   I only ate 1.5 slices and packed the rest to go, since I had other places to be. It did take a while for my check to be taken and processed, but it was fine because I had a discount and I was able to leave a cash tip (a reason to always carry small bills!)

    "text": "I'm so torn on this review...I like the pizza at Grimaldi's. It's not life changing good, but it's very good. I especially like their crust, you can tell they have good pizza ovens.  You walk in and you feel like you're in an old school Italian place...Pretty cool. Red checkered table cloths, Sinatra type music playing, you get the drift. Service is attentive and usually pretty quick. Even if the restaurant is busy they seem to staff it appropriately so your food won't take forever. The wait to get in can be really long, especially on weekends in the fall and winter (AKA tourist/snow bird season).  The thing that kills me about Grimaldi's is the price. It's expensive for what you get. The prices seem reasonable when you sit down, there are different price points for the different sauce options (red/white/pesto), and a large pizza is base priced at $18. Doesn't seem bad, but that's just for sauce and cheese. It's when you start adding toppings that your bill will skyrocket. For example: I came here a few weeks ago and we ordered a large pesto based with grilled chicken and artichokes on half (side note: If you order a topping only on half, they will still charge you the full price for that topping...Seems like price gouging to me, but whatever). This pizza ended up being $27+ tax and tip, and that was for two toppings. If any of you are interested in doing a supreme style pizza, be prepared to take out a loan to pay for it.   Overall the pizza, service and ambiance are good, though it's overpriced in my mind. Grimaldi's is still hands down the best pizza option in Old Town, and I will almost certainly be back at some point.",

I ordered a size half and half....One side was the specialty ROSEMARY POTATO PIZZA it included gorgonzola cheese.....ummmmm on my HOMER SIMPSON VOICE....The other side was my OLD FAITHFUL for all pizza pepperoni and sausage....oooo weeeeee...The sauce is tangy...The Pepperoni is awesome with a slight snap and the Italian Sausage is flavorful with a nice spice kick....i do see what one person said about the red sauce being thin but I like it that way if I wanted a lot of sauce I would have asked or got breadsticks from the hut...ijs...oh and crust is what brick oven pizza is all about...henceforth the name BRICK OVEN,  not BURNT OVEN....i am even more excited that we have one of these joints in Dallas. CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS A+++, the manager even swung by to chat it up a bit. Total Awesome Sauce.",

    "text": "This place does some real business, but even coming over on a Saturday night at about 6 during Spring Training, the wait was only about 25 minutes.  I call that quite acceptable.  The decor is what one might call \"pizza place.\"  It looks like a pizza place and it smells like a pizza place.    Pizza is just about all Grimaldi's does.  The menu is pretty bare bones.  They have a few blank pizzas (red sauce, garlic sauce, etc) and several toppings ranging from $2 to $4 a piece.  There are no premade pizzas, so you have to design your own, and if you're wanting a behemoth 5 topping pizza, your bill will add up quickly.  We had sausage, sweet peppers, and mushrooms, and it was an excellent combination.  The sweet peppers are almost meaty in texture.  The pizza is very lightly sauced and comes thin crust only.  They also have a few salads, served family style.  We just had a small house salad between the two of us starving fatties, and it was a good portion, especially for only $5.  Pretty standard stuff, but a nice way to start the meal nonetheless.  The service was very good the whole night.  The waitress took ownership of the place, which I always like (\"You've never been here before?  Great.  I have three basic types of pizza... I have all these toppings,\" etc).  We had a really cool table right next to the kitchen so I got to see a lot of pizzas being made, and I have to say, people really friggin like pepperoni.  Branch out and try something new!  The pizza was good, but the thin crust got soggy as it sat, and it didn't absolutely blow me away.  That and the limited menu, which I didn't personally mind but I would warn people about, knock it down a star.  But I'd still recommend the place.",

I also lived in Italy when I was in the Navy and was blessed to enjoy the heavenly wood fired stone oven pies that was as good as it gets.  Throughout my travels, Grimaldi's is the closest thing to the great pizzas of Italy.  Cooked over charcoal briquets, the pizzas come out perfectly -- thin crusts that are tender and soft yet rigid enough where it won't collapse.  The crust is bursting with flavor.  Cheese and toppings were equal to the outstanding crust.   I had my Grimaldi's plain and I had it once with anchovies.  I loved both. But as I learned in Italy: The best pizzas, the ones the old \"paisons\" liked were the simple cheese pizzas with no toppings [The old men of Italy would probably laugh at some American dude eating a sloppy 12-topping \"Supreme Pizza.\" That's not pizza, that's garbage on dough!!!]. I'd say the plain cheese pizza is the best pizza to get at Grimaldi's.  Salads, beverages and service are all top notch.  Servers are friendly and attractive.  You can't go wrong with the many great restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale.  But Grimaldi's is probably my favorite.",

The closest I've come is Pazzia, an Italian Trattoria in San Francisco (which doesn't really count because it's not a 'by the slice' pizzeria) and Casa Bianca in LA.  Nothing else is truly noteworthy.  The wife and I went to Phoenix a few weeks ago to look at real estate.  While there, I wanted to try some NY/Chicago food because there's a huge influence there.  This led us to Yelp...  which led us to Grimaldi's.  Let me tell you something...   bomb.  Good crust, good sauce, good cheese, quality meats.  Excellent.  I was very happy.    Plus, there are certain types of salad dressings that just feel like Chicago or NY.  Grimaldi's has that too.  I think they're sweeter and less acidic or something.  Anyway, if you don't like Grimaldi's, then you just don't get it when it comes to pizza.  Grimaldi's, please open a location in LA.",

While I can't say that it's good as it's famous sister, I can say that it's pretty darn good especially for all the pizza imitators out here.  Mmm spicy pepperoni, chicken sausage, and onion.  Maybe it means I'm getting old but give me a night with my girl, a large one of these pizzas, a bottle of wine, and a tiramisu.  The calzones are a little ehhh.  Maybe I'm just spoiled from the juicy ones back east.  The values aren't the greatest, it being a chain and all but I love the place and I frequent this joint all the time.  Extra super bonus points for having such coureous staff.  Love you Grimaldis!",

Parking might be a hassle however we were able to find a small spot in the back lot... Located to the west of the building... Glad my car is small because the parking spaces are very tight and close... Entrance to Grimaldi's is on the Scottsdale road side and one you walk in the hosts are to your right... It was a fairly crowded spot for a Friday evening but we were seated in a matter of seconds... A nice little table was open adjacent to the kitchen... It certainly added to the experience as we were able to see what went on behind the glass... It was exciting to see the dough being made, the dough being tossed, and the dough being covered in Uber deliciousness...   Our server Chelsea was fabulous... She asked if we had dined at Grimaldi's before and when we informed her that we hadn't, she informed us on the history, the favorites, and the wine list... She seemed to have several tables to cover in her section but she was always there to refill our drinks and helped us when we needed something  We started off with the house salad and they were excellent... The vinaigrette dressing was divine... As for our pizza... We split a large one in half and it was the perfect amount for 2 people... On one half we had just cheese  And on the other we had pepperoni Both were amazing and we loved the thin crust, succulent sauce, and the fresh toppings...   The entire ambience of the restaurant was fun and really added into our great experience... From the red checkered table covers to the sounds of the working kitchen... Grimaldi's is a hit in our books!",

    "text": "There is perhaps nothing more stressful than being forced to choose the restaurant to eat at for an evening. Grimaldi's had just come into my mind because i knew it was nearby and that i've been there a couple previous times and didn't hate it. My parents and i had returned from my award ceremony and we were planning on meeting my sister for dinner at the restaurant. Well surprise, surprise, she ended up being over an HOUR late. I was really embarrassed of what our waiter would think.. But he displayed no signs of judgement. I don't believe i ever got his name but he was bald and had glasses. Anyway, my initial reaction to the restaurant and the atmosphere was not an entirely positive one.. Although most of the busboys were incredibly attractive, it was always chilly, and my ice cold lemonade that i always order did not help! Also, the tables were a bit uncomfortably close together. I had the misfortune to being seated within 3 feet of a baby. The baby wasn't loud or fussy or anything, i just genuinely felt a discomfort with its presence to be honest. When it comes to the food, it was satisfactory. I ordered a personal calzone (12 inches) with pepperoni, green peppers, and mushrooms. It was pretty good but i would be lying if i said i didn't agree with Leslie Knope when she states that \"calzones are just harder to eat pizzas\" i ended up have more of the incredible thin crust pizza my parents ordered..:-/ When my sister finally arrived... an hr late.... My parents and i had already finished eating with MORE than enough leftovers for her. It was at that time that i decided to treat myself with a Simoa cookie cheesecake. It was epic. The two-stall bathrooms were also very nice and clean, plus it was cool because no one else was in there so i got to look at my butt in the mirror with NO hesitation.. Which was nice. When it all comes down to it.. I gave Grimaldi's a three. I will most likely be returning but not anytime soon i hope. I think another downside i forgot to mention was when my dad made me carry the leftover box on our way out but thats unrelated and isn't the restaurants fault.",

I went to check at 35 minutes, and we were next on the list.  Finally, at an hour, I went back inside to check. \"Oh, we buzzed you twice, you didn't answer.\" Um, no. I purposely didn't wander somewhere more comfy and away for douchey guys with their collars popped so that I could be near the door. And if someone doesn't answer their buzzer, how about stepping the 2 feet out the door and calling their name, so maybe at the least, you could get your pizza shaped buzzer back.  It didn't really get better from there. We finally got sat. It took forever to order, and longer to get our food. Not to mention that all three of our glasses (sprite, iced tea and water) stood empty for literally 25 minutes (I timed it). Calzones came and they were ok, but certainly nothing to write home about.  From being seated to getting out of there, it was about 1 hour, 45 minutes. That's how slow the service was.  I'm giving 3 stars, because I have since heard that their pizza is their thing, and I'm willing to wait and see on that.",

I will recommend this restaurant to everyone I know. It is located in the quaint area known as Old Town, perfect for walking off the best pizza I've ever had!!  The spinach salad had the freshest ingredients and the dressing was perfect!  The atmosphere......WOW!  So nice to sit in the courtyard under the breeze in November!  Did I mention that the service was terrific!!!  Will definitely be back!!",

But behold, thou art a lone deucer table. \"hi.. table for one please\".... the hostess, who was snipishly looking at me wirh her pair of cohorts on either side murmured.. \"the wait will be about....\"; then she thought twice and reassessed the situation and sat me right away at the deucer.  I have high hopes for my personal sausage & pepperoni..  Ok.... So being from the northeast, I have yet to find decent pizza west of the Mississippi.. and when I noticed the 4 star pizza place w/ reviews like \"best pizza in AZ\" I was hopeful to break the almighty pizza mold.. Nope nill negative. While it was tasty, west coast just doesn't compare to east coast pizza. I give the food a 7.25/10.  While the pizza was decent, the service was snippishly adequate.

Your sauce is amazing... great rich flavor and not too oily and not too sweet.  So thank you Grimaldi's, you remind me of home!!!   The salad was full of fresh ripe veggies and the dressing was oh so good.  You had the right amount of everything, where I was able to taste feta, cucumbers, lettuce, tomatoes, kalamata olives and onions in every bite.      And as an added bonus the person who answered the phone was extremely polite and professional.  I believe he was the bartender.  My only suggestion would be to actually use kalamata olives as your menu advertised.  You used the cheaper version, black olives which were fine but I was expecting kalamata olives.",

    "text": "On a resent trip to Scottsdale I had a craving for pizza; a quick Yelp search showed Gimaldi's Coal Fired Bick Oven Pizza only a few blocks away. It was 104 degrees, but it was a dry heat, so off I went.   I'm glad I did, it seems Gimaldi's of NY is opening a few franchises across the country. Anyway it was a Sunday evening about 5:00 PM and there was plenty of open seating. I was seated and after a quick look at the menu I ordered a 18\" cheese. A bit much for 1 person but I was starving and wanted a couple slices left over for a late night snack. BTW the 18\" turned out to be the perfect size for its intended use.  The secret to great pizza is the crust with requires heat, very high heat. Coal ovens produce very high heat. My pizza arrived in short order, thin crust with a nice char, lightly sauced, fresh mozzarella and fresh basil. It looked and smelled great, it tasted equally good. The fresh mozzarella and basil was a welcome change from the usual. The sauce tasted fresh and light. Very close to pizza perfection. If you like pizza with a lot of sauce and loaded with toppings I would recommend that you go somewhere else, pizza like this only get ruined loaded down. At $16 it may seem a bit pricy but for this kind of quality I find it very reasonable.   Service was very good, and decor was \"tendy\" NY. They also have a nice wine list.  Gimaldi's served me one of the best pizzas I have had in a long time. So if in Old Town Scottsdale and in the need of pizza Gimaldi's is the only choice in my book, enjoy.",

That first steaming bite of a Grimaldi's pizza used to be something wonderful that you could not experience outside of New York. Lately, however, something's changed. Either they're using a new recipe for sauce or crust or have made some other change, but everything's more bland. One of the servers admitted there had been some changes. I'd guess that something has forced them to cut corners, but the pizzas now  have almost a commercial taste. Sorry to have lost one of my favorite places to eat but I can't pay 50.00 for a pizza that I could get in any chain establishment.",

The pizza is delicious. We ordered 2 large pizza, antipasto, and 4 desserts. I do wish that they had pizzas already put together instead of 100% having to build them. It makes a supreme quite pricey, but still good. Where they are loosing 1 star for me is really the service of the managers. We were served one pizza and 20 minutes later, after the first one was done the second one came out even though they were ordered at the same time. The manager brought the clearly burnt pizza to us. He explained that it was burnt and offered to make us a new one, he was very polite. We declined and said it was fine, we would just eat it that way as we had already waited and didnt want to wait any longer. After a few sentences back and forth and him being more than apologetic, he told us he would, \"figure something out.\" We all took it as give us some kinda discount. Five minutes later another manager is hanging out around our table clearly looking at our food, but didn't say a word. When we all looked at him he said \"looks perfect to me.\" We all just looked at each other mystified. When the bill came nothing was taken off or discounted. Don't say you're going to do something and not! That was quiet annoying, but we will still be back. The waitress was pretty good.",

    "text": "I had reviewed another Grimaldi's in Peoria and happened to find myself in Old Scottsdale, looking for a good place to eat.  Lucky for me, Grimaldi's was there.    The wait was said to be up to 25 minutes, but for an outside table, they took my wife and me right away.  Firing up the propane heaters kept the bite out of the air.  To get to the point, this Grimaldi's did not disappoint either.  I think one of the standout qualities of their pies is the quality of the crust.  Of all the pizza spots in the Valley so far, none have really stood up to the \"can you eat it without drooping\" test.  Which is to say, with a couple of toppings, do you have to fold it to get it to your mouth without flopping over, or do you absolutely need a knife and fork to cut it up?  Grimaldi's pizza needs neither.  The crust, very tasty from the coal-fired oven, is crispy enough to pick up without need to hold it with two hands, and it holds the toppings well.  It's not greasy or drippy or any of that.  And when you take home any leftovers, the crust is still firm.  To me, that is the mark of great crust.    The toppings are flavorful, too.  This time, succulent sun-dried tomatoes, fresh garlic, and tasty artichokes shared the top of the pie with fresh white mozzarella.  The sauce is subtle but there.  I also ordered their Mediterranean salad, pretty much a standard Greek salad with lots of Romaine lettuce.  Cool and crisp, when they say a small size can be split by two, they are correct: the bowl looks small but it is deep.  I did split a large as I was hungry, but we did take home some of the salad and pizza.  Again we got the tiramisu, not made by them, but nevertheless melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Service was great: despite being very busy, our waitress checked on us several times and was very friendly.",

    "text": "I have celebrated multiple birthdays here and it's one of my favorites. I usually prefer a thicker crust to my pizza but this place is a delicious exception. The brick oven flavor is amazing and with all the topping available, there are really no bad choices. The only cavet I would have about the food is that it can take a long time to get the pizza to the table, but once you take a bit you will realize why.    The restaurant itself is smartly decorated but nothing flashy or distracting, your basic pizzeria stuff. While they do accommodate large groups, I would highly suggest making reservations, especially on the weekends. With a delicious place like this being located in Old Town, they are usually pretty busy. I have received nothing but the best service when I've eaten here so that never an issue. And as a heads up, if you have enough people, they will give you the private room in the back for your party. Convenient when it's your birthday and you want to pre game a bit before going out to the clubs haha.   If you're a pizza lover, like myself, check this place out for sure.",

You: \"But isn't their pizza just like the Grimaldi's 2 blocks from your house?\"  Patsy Grimaldi's in Scottsdale doesn't have the fluffly, chewy crust of its brethren in the NYC area. Instead, the crust is crispier a la Frank Pepe's of New Haven. Of course, I loved Frank Pepe, so that's certainly not a criticism. Just don't go expecting fluffy, chewy crust!",

Upon entering, you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coal-fired oven.  This is swoon-inducing---and I mean that in a good way.  The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coal-fired oven in the Northeast.  When ordering pizza baked in a coal-fired oven, I like to get a plain cheese pizza.  IMO, this is the best way to fully taste the sauce, cheese and crust without anything else get in the way.    There's nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coal-fired oven with that char on the crust.  The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft.  The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano.  The amount of cheese is just right.  I love to savor each and every bite.  There is more to this Grimaldi's than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge.  This one has other items in addition to the pizza.  We like their antipasto.  It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy, black and green olives (the black ones are pitted, the green ones have pits in them),  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor, and a good, flavorful salami.  Everytime we're in AZ, it is so worth it to us to deal with the heavy traffic in Old Town Scottsdale to dine at Grimaldi's!",

Highly recommend the plain-jane pepperoni, as this will give you a basis to compare all other lower forms of pizza you have encountered prior to theirs (it may be simple, but the ingredients are awesome). Also, the cheese cake is almost too damned good and decadent. The friendly crew that runs the place takes care of you. Great for date nights, family/group gatherings, or just ordering up a good take-out pie. They make it the old-fashioned way, and though it comes at a bit of a higher price than your run-of-the-mill fast food pizzas, I can nearly assure you won't be disappointed.",

We didn't eat the salad, or anything except for a pepperoni & italian sausage pizza. We got ricotta cheese on 1/2 of the pizza. (Which was amazing!)   We did research on Yelp before we chose where to go eat for pizza and so glad we went to Grimaldi's. Wonderful customer service also. Two managers came to see how we enjoyed our meal & the server was very helpful and knowledgable.   We sat next to where they made the pizzas, so we could see it all done before our eyes. Very nice to see how they cooked it and how precise they make each pizza. Can't wait to eat it again! Enjoy!",

Although I appreciate the \"freeness\" of the pie, I'm going to have to pass in the future. Why? The pizza here is just not very good.  I should have known when the waitress offered garlic and oregano with the pie. If I wanted to season it myself, I would have made it at home. Seriously, this sauce is just pureed tomatoes. I think they try to make up for it with Buffalo mozzarella, but the bulk of any pizza is the crust and sauce. Although the former is tasty, the latter is a waste of tomatoes.   Thankfully, I didn't pay for it, because a large pizza goes for nearly $20 here. My suggestion is to head to a local Barro's and get something much less expensive and better. The benefit here is that the service was pretty good, but if you're looking for pizza, walk on by.",

Nice clean restaurant with friendly servers.  The pizza with the thin crust is just out of this world.  Made with olive oil and coal oven baked.  The curst is thin but sturdy and crunchy.  So, nice to the taste.   You have the basic cheese pizza, and then can can any ingredients for extra charge.  I had a personal pizza with sausage, mushrooms and olives.  Okay, the sausage was wonderful, the mushrooms freshly cut and the olives freshly cut.  No canned anything.  Outstanding!  Had a small salad and large soda which was refilled 3 times.   Just fabulous thin crust pizza.   Highly recommended!",

It's great for a date night or to come with friends and it's a really great place to bring people when they come into town. It's a really classic feeling pizza place inside. The staff is always friendly and it is usually really crowded. They have private rooms for birthday parties, a patio, and two rooms of tables so it's pretty big. The Caesar salad is good to start with and then we usually go with our friends who know how to order the best pizza (extra sauce, ricotta and pepperoni  I think??). The ricotta is what really makes it tasty. They have a good wine selection and the house red wine is good. This is a good place for people of all ages too, we had some friends come into town with their baby and we were like where are we going to go in old town that's baby friendly?

We stood close by the host table when we heard our name for the first time being called as \"last call\". How could we have missed it when we were standing right there watching several other groups being seated before us? Upon being seated we were greeted promptly but after that, our waitress was few and far between. After ordering our first drink, we didn't see her to order our dinner for over 20 minutes. While watching tables around us who ordered after we did receive their food before us was frustrating, I have to admit their pizza is awesome. Until the waitress realized she forgot our next round of drinks. The pizza is terrific but the service is horrendous! From now on, to-go orders is the only way to go.",

The crust was perfectly cooked throughout and every flavor shined in each pizza.  The reason I am giving it four stars is because the Caprese Salad fell just flat. The tomatoes where soggy and the mozzarella cheese was very tough and not fresh. The only thing fresh in that dish was the basil which was very aromatic. We will definitely be coming back for the pizza experience only. I highly recommend this place.",

For instance, the pepperoni was fresh and had a good taste - I just prefer thinner slices that are more crispy. The sauce was good and slightly sweet. Probably the best part was the crust - crispy on the bottom, but chewy on the inside and had a nice flavor.  As for the atmosphere, everything was very clean... I haven't seen such clean drink glasses in a long time. The utensils and cloth were also very good.  Service was adequate - the waiters were aware of their tables, providing refills as needed and checking in at a reasonable rate. Drinks were brought out quickly. When there were seats available we were seated quickly.",

    "text": "This was the worst dining experience I've ever had at the Old Town location. We had a party of 11, reservation was for 10 and one more person showed up at the last minute. Everyone was in town for my father's funeral, so we thought it would be nice to get everyone together the night before and have a nice dinner. Once we mentioned to the manager that we had one more person in our party, she said she would bring an extra chair over, so two people could sit at the head of the table. Imagine, two adults sitting at the head of the table, with no space whatsoever to eat. We asked if we could move the small table that was sitting against the emergency exit door. The manager refused to consider our suggestion or come up with a better solution and kept insisting that she would bring another chair over, because moving the small table would block the walkway (which was unTrue because there was 6ft) and the table was 2ft.  It was not blocking the walk way, it was an actual fire hazard with the table blocking the emergency exit door (in its original location). The service was terrible. Drinks were forgotten, pizzas did not come out together, waiter didn't check on us to see if we needed anything. The Grimaldi's in Old Town is a big mistake. The other location may be different considering that more of the locals go there, not tourists.  Waiting the hour to be sat was definitely not worth it at all. Hopefully, from this review the manager can reevaluate her customer service skills and learn how to communicate more effectively and accommodate her customers better, to ensure that they have a positive experience.",

They lived in NY before so they have tried the restaurant in NYC and they enjoyed their pizza a lot so we decided to give it a try here in Scottsdale too. We were a big group of 8 (inclusive of 2 children) so we were offered the private room which was fine with us.  The private room was set up in less than 5 min and we wee called in. Our waitress soon came in and introduced herself and took our drink orders. When she came back with our drinks, we placed our salad orders as well as our mains.  The salad came out in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered the House salad and so did my mother in law. Although we placed our order at he same time, it took at least 5 min or more for her salad to come out. We were surprised why it took so long between the two! Never mind though. The mains to follow compensated for that.  Our order for mains was 3 pizzas, 1 cheese, 1 veg and 1 special (artichoke with Kalamata olives). Out of all three, our fav was the third one. Very tasty and fresh, what differentiates their pizza from other places is the fact that they cook it on coal! Very yummy idea!  All in all, service was great, food was tasty and atmosphere was nice! 4 rather than 5 stars? One needs to be super impressed before throwing in that last super star ;) Recommended and will be going there again!",

Quickly seated and greeted, and although our table was at a busy corner, we had a great perspective of the entire place, most importantly the brick-oven.  Our caesar salad came quickly and was better than average.  Shortly after, our \"small\" Italian sausage and mushroom pizza arrived, and fully satiated our ravenous appetites.  Fresh mozzarella, flavorful sausage, and delicious sauce, all combined with perfectly crispy crust... Mmmmm.  Pizza.  Will (we'll) be back.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Grimaldi's for years and I finally made it here! My friend and I got lucky and showed up on a Tuesday so to our surprise they offered 1/2 off glasses and bottles of wine.  It's hard for me to get too complex when it comes to Pizza, so I stuck with the basics. Garden salad and pepperoni pizza. Both were really great.   What I couldn't help but notice was the relaxing environment. Open kitchen, brick walls... it was cozy but very casual. There was quit a diverse mix of diners ranging from us gals grabbing an early dinner to families with children and everyone in between.  My friend thought she had read somewhere that they imported their water from New York to make the dough at one point in time. We asked, it wasn't the case anymore. But now they do triple filter to get the water to get the dough as authentic to New York style as possible!  Grimaldi's... simple and classic!",

    "text": "A few years back and before this place popped up in Old Town, I spent a week in New York City.  Having studied my trusty Fodor's guide (pre-Yelp era, of course), I knew that one of the most well-regarded pizza dinners awaited me under the Brooklyn Bridge on Old Fulton St.  Walking there, my friends and I met a lonely drifter who followed behind the group, promising not to stab us.  He just wanted some company.  We found Grimaldi's, said goodbye to our shady new friend, and had a delicious meal.  At the time, I didn't know if I really enjoyed the food or I just really enjoyed that I was eating it under the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City.  I just knew that the restaurant found itself near the top of my \"things to tell my friends back home about my trip even though they are just nodding politely waiting for me to finish\" list.  Less than a year later, I'm driving down Scottsdale Road and I see the sign.  No way!  The same Grimaldi's?!  My girlfriend and I had to try it again.  Same result.  Delicious brick-oven pizza.  Great atmosphere.  Great wine list.  Another time, I went there for my birthday and they put our group in the \"Patsy Room.\"  If you want a quieter and more separated dining experience, ask about it.  I thought it was nice.  There are some other locations around town, but this one is my favorite.",

    "text": "I've been to the place in NYC - oh no wait...I've gone to the place and have been deterred by the 2 hour line more than once. Very frustrating when all you want is to treat your out of town guests to some really amazing pizza! So when we walked by this place while cruising downtown Scottsdale, I was surprised to learn they had locations outside of the one busier-than-all-F place under the Brooklyn Bridge. So my dad and I gave it a shot.   Now I've had (several, actually) discussions with the bf on what constitutes good pizza (it's VERY subjective, but still there are universal goods and bads). And I think I can unequivocally say, this is awesome pizza! The coal-fired taste is scrumptious. It came out hot - we had onions and mushrooms. The mozz cheese was great - not rubbery, not greasy, just delicious.   We also had a small salad (the waitress tipped us off that a small was enough for 2 ppl - thanks for that! - she was right and saved us $3 and a lot of wasted salad). The salad was basic, good, and the dressing was yummy. And a half-carafe of red wine was was definitely enough for both of us (full from earlier drinks).   ONE complaint would be there isn't enough sauce (whatever sauce there was, it was tasty, but could have used 50% more!). Other than that, at $30-ish for the entire meal (!!!) I can say my dad will definitely be back since he lives there, and I will put my full support behind that! :)",

Less of a wait if you grab one of those and I actually like the atmosphere in the bar area better. It's a great place to stop for a bite before or after the free Art Walk on Thursday nights in Old Town.   Last time we were there they mentioned that they stoke their ovens (sounds kinky) from 4-5 pm daily, so nothing goes in the oven during that time.   They have specials on their wines on Tuesdays. I think they were half off.",

    "text": "I've been having a torrid love affair with Grimaldi's.    Where I work, there's a little deli downstairs.  I eat there pretty much everyday.  The food there isn't great, but it's right down stairs and I feel at home there and they have soup and salad and stuff.  My little office deli has been closed for the holidays.  I am a creature of habit, so I've been having to venture off to fend for myself food-wise.  I felt like pizza--I was hungover, mind you--so I used Yelp to find something.  I typed in my zip code and \"pizza\" and Grimaldi's popped up.  When I was ordering, in a groggy voice, with a headache, I think the phone conversation went like this:  \"Grimaldi's, how can I help you?\"  \"Yeah,\"  I said.  \"Do you guys deliver?\"  \"No, we don't.\"  \"Shit.  Um,\"  I googled them and saw they were like a three minute bike ride away.  \"I'd like to put in an order for pick-up then.\"  They asked me what I wanted on my pizza and I went with the usual sleazy choices.  They told me they didn't have canadian bacon.  I was like, what the fuck?  I asked if I could get bread sticks.  No bread sticks.  I was like, fine.  Just the pizza, then.  When I rode my bike there, I realized, \"Oooohhhhh, this is a fancy place.  I had no idea.\"  I'm a dirtbag, so, to me this place is pretty much like my idea of upscale.  I rode my bike back to work with one hand, the other hand on my pizza.  When I got out of the elevator, these people were like, \"Grimaldi's?  Mmmmm!\"  I finally dug in.  It was delicious.  Seriously.  I can't imagine pizza tasting much better.  If pizza were better, my taste buds would react in a confused manner and I think the result would be a negative experience.  This is a delicate balancing act of being delicious without creating a transcendant experience into a foody hell.  I thought the pizza was overpriced until I tried it.  I ate the whole pizza by myself at work.  I ate Grimaldi's and, since it was super slow that day, I watched The God's Must be Crazy.  Easily, one of the best workdays I've ever had.  Since then, I've been there to eat another pizza and a huge, baby-sized calzone.  This is a great place.  The help is always nice to me, even though everyone's dressed nice and I come in all red-faced and sweaty after locking my bike up to a street sign since I was not able to find a bike rack.",

Low and behold, Grimaldi's. While I will mention that the pizza I ordered totally rocked. I ordered a plain personal white with garlic (and a side of sauce). Great crust, the sauce was a little on the acidic side.  What I would like to give Grimaldi's the ultimate rating for is the fact that the mozzarella on the pizza is from happy grass-fed free-range cows. I am beyond impressed that Grimaldi's cares enough about the happiness of the cows to use a more expensive cheese.  I can eat pizza again!",

I came in to the restaurant on Saturday afternoon after spending most of the day at the Culinary Festival.  For some reason, we had a craving for pizza after eating a slice from Spinatti's at the festival.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.  When we came in to Grimaldi's, we were informed of a 20 minute wait for a table and instead decided to grab the four available seats at the bar.  We were in a good mood and definately had a few drinks during the festival and were enjoying the time with some friends.  The bartender seemed to be in a sour mood (maybe from people before us) and immediately said \"I am not serving you any drinks\" before we even asked for anything.  He then proceeded to accuse us of being obnoxious and loud and walked away without even asking for our order.  I found this one of the worst experiences of my entire life in a restaurant and will never step foot into Grimaldi's again.  We filed a complaint with the manager and went on our way to Malee's where they were happy to serve us food and drinks and had a much better time.  Patsy Grimaldi's should do a much better job in training their staff in courtesy and customer service.",

Grimaldi's is definitely one the best pizza places I have found out here.  I also recommend Famous Ray's.  If you;re looking for good pizza in AZ, you can't go wrong with Grimaldi's.

Now I don't know if this a common problem with natural coal stoves or what, so I'm not going to slam them too hard because of that.  I will however slam them for the caprese salad we ordered. Mozzarella was mediocre at best but the real kicker was the three day old thinly cut pieces of tomato. I mean come on, show some pride in your product and cut me a fresh tomato. Don't give me slices of tomato that have been sitting in a sixth pan for three days.",

And not in a good way. Every time he came to our table he would stand there and wait for us to speak first which I found rather strange and off putting. He was the employee, shouldn't he have led the conversation? He literally stood by our table until I said \"well, I think we're ready to order.\" Weird. Whatever.  The boyfriend and I ordered a sausage and mushroom pizza. I was excited because I usually love hand-tossed brick oven pizza and I had read so many great reviews. Our pizza was lukewarm and the crust in the middle of the pizza was soggy. It was fine on the outer edges but what a way to start a slice - with a mouthful of soggy pizza goo. I thought it was pretty expensive as well.  So now all I think of when I think of Grimaldi's is a soggy pizza. Yuck. I don't think I'll be rushing back for more.",

We also shared the small greek salad (which was enormous) -- we got the dressing on the side -- which I think is usually a safe bet with any kind of vinaigarette -- too much can ruin a salad.    All in all, a stellar experience.  This place *may* just take over as my fave pizza in Phoenix!",

I usually have about two slices of pizza but one sufficed. The chicken Cesar salad was also a hefty size. Overall the food was pretty delicious. The employees were really friendly and welcoming. I would return when given the opportunity.",

I have those days where I feel like grazing rather than eating a meal, and this is the perfect thing.  I can snack on cheese, olives, and salami as I feel like it and it keeps well in the fridge.  (takeout of course)   I've also had their caprese - which is good but I've been spoiled by another restaurant that has an awesome balsamic reduction for theirs.    I've heard the pizza here is great, and it certainly smells awesome, but I haven't tried it.  I really like their food, but occasionally they forget to include things in my order, and having to run back to a restaurant to pick up a missed item is -1 star....",

While we usually enjoy going to Grimaldi's, the service at this location was horrible.  First, we wait at the front desk for five minutes before the gentleman even acknowledges us.  While I understand he may have been busy, a simple acknowledgement that he would be right with us would have been nice.  Next, after we got seated, we sat at the table for over 15 minutes.  During this time, no server ever approached our table even though there were numerous servers at the restaurant and the restaurant was only abut half full.  We decided to leave and when we left I informed the person at the front desk that we were leaving since no server ever came to our table.  He didn't didn't seem to care.  I will not go back to this location.",

    "text": "Best pizza you can get in Arizona hands down. A bit on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you pay for!   Build your own pizza by choosing the size, sauce, and all the toppings. On our first try we had the red sauce with roasted red bell peppers and meatballs. The meatballs are sliced thin and have a great authentic flavor, while the peppers were out of this world, yet were a bit overwhelming in the sense that they dominated over all the other flavors. Not to mention the crust was to die for; thin and crunchy and cooked perfectly!  On our second visit we had another red sauce pie with meatballs, ricotta cheese, and mushrooms. The meatballs prevailed yet again, and this time we could really enjoy the amazing red sauce without the overpowering flavor from the red bell peppers. The ricotta is a MUST, and the mushrooms are a great veggie adding additional meaty consistency.   This venue is huge and we did not have any trouble being seated at lunch or dinner time. We sat in the outside courtyard on our most recent visit at lunch time, and it was very beautiful. I hope to sit there again after sundown to enjoy the lighting and romantic atmosphere.   This place is absolutely a must try for any pizza lover in the area!",

The pizza is amazing. And if you have room for a piece of cheesecake, tiramisu, or my favorite, a  cannoli, get the trio and settle for all of it. I'm a big fan of Grimaldi's and especially the old town location. Brian runs a perfect ship for us that crave a Grimaldi's fix in our lives. I see people getting take out all the time, so I'm not alone. Sit at the bar and let Dallas take care of you.

While wondering, \"could this be related to 'the' Grimaldi's from NY\" I quickly launched the Yelp app on my iPhone and found the location for Grimaldi's.   Step 3. I admitted my thankfulness that the restaurant was still open (thank you, Yelp, for telling me the hours).  Step 4. Walked to the restaurant, which wasn't too far from the hotel I was staying at. .  Step 5. Ordered a pizza.  This was probably the hardest part, due to the growing anticipation of deliciousness while waiting for a painful 20 minutes.  Gosh!  Step 6. Paid about $22 for a large (which isn't huge, but is decent) pizza and walked back to the hotel.  Step 7: Ate an amazing pizza by a gorgeous pool in Phoenix.  The cost and the wait were worth the price of admission.  Half pepperoni and half sausage.  Thin crust and brick oven baked.  YUM!  Step 8: Wrote this review after returning home, and am salivating at the thought of a pizza that is 3,000 miles away.  Perhaps it's worth a return trip to AZ :)",

Ordered the Mediterranean and spinach salad (large) as apps for the 7 people table. It was definitely enough and both were good however the spinach seemed to be the favorite. Note the waiter (josh I believe was his name) allowed us to substitute the bacon for crotons, which is always very nice!   For dinner we had two large pizza, one red sauce with olives, green bell pepper, onions and fresh garlic--this was definitely the favorite for the majority of us! The red sauce and garlic mixture was perfect!  The other one was a pesto with mushroom and artichokes, good as well.  Both pizzas were well cooked and not soggy, and the waiter was very ontop of our drink refills along with apologizing the delay (took about 40-45 minutes but it was a full house!   Last I loved that our reservations were at 7pm and when  we got there at exactly 7 and they sat us down immediately--now that's what I call fulfilling your reservations! I love when places can do that!   Only downside was the tables seemed pretty squeezed together and with tall family members, it was hard to push our seats back to stretch our legs as we were right by the kitchen:/",

Now, for my pizza, I ordered it without cheese (not by choice :(  ) and it was still outrageous!!! The ingredients were fresh and the crust was divinely crispy. As for the pizza with cheese (as it should be, I know) they use fresh mozzarella, and it didn't looked smothered by it either.  I love their outdoor patio.....it's a cute little courtyard, nice and shady....looks like little Italy. :)  When my next pizza craving strikes, I know where I'm headed!",

Go with the roasted red peppers! I do agree with a previous reviewer, they are a bit stingy on the toppings.  Don't get me wrong--this is the best pizza you will find in AZ.  These guys take their time and even have a water filtration system to balance it the same as NY's water. Think the water doesn't matter when you are making the dough--Think Again!   Also give the house red a try. I usually do not enjoy the house wines very much, but at Grimaldi's, it is actually my fav.  This is a great place for a first date--you will not break the bank and you can really enjoy some quality pizza and wine.",

The pizza was good, though it seemed lukewarm when it was served. Like once it left the wonderful coal brick oven, it sat in the open for a little too long. For the lunch crowd on a workday, the pizzas weren't served fast enough, in my opinion. Don't go here if you have limited time!   All in all, a good choice. I, of course, recommend the pesto-style pizza. Adding chicken and fresh tomatoes was a nice touch.   Between 3 of us, the bill was around $33. Not bad. Then again, we didn't splurge on drinks or dessert, though the idea of eating their Amaretto Cheesecake makes me smile.",

There are plenty of nice bottles for $20. - There seemed to be ample parking, which tends to be tough in this neighborhood.  What I didn't like: - the crowds and wait time at 7PM on Saturday, although I can see why it's worth the wait. - Lack of variety -- the menu could benefit from more salad options, for example - the bar area could be larger to better accommodate waiting customers",

Once our server got our order, I didn't see him for the rest of our meal. Two different servers delivered our pie and calzone and another one got us a box and the check. I did look around once, when my fiance's beer was empty and my water was getting low and our server was leaning against a wall chatting with another employee.

We found the best way to enjoy the pizza is asking the server to have the cook's leave the pizza in the oven for a little extra time. This way the crust stays from becoming soggy so quickly. Over the years they have added a few locations. I use to go to the one in DC ranch, now its at the Scottsdale quarter. Once went to the Glendale location. All in all the service is consistent across all locations. Great place to pop in for a quick pizza. Don't go overboard on toppings as the cost will add up quickly. Bring the full service bar back to the old town location!",

    "text": "I came across their pizza at the culinary festival a few years ago. I kept wanting to try it again, but it is a little far from my home. So I finally grabbed my wife and said \"tonight it's my night to decide where we are going to ear\".  Now we make it a point to go there once a week.   The pizza is some of the best I've ever tasted.  Not sure why or what it is about it. Maybe it is the sauce, but yet it may be the crust.  This is the type of food that your mouth waters when you think about it.  I highly recommend trying Grimaldi's. But get there early.    Sitting in the bar area is always fun too.",

Now, I look at the menu and Grimaldi's appears to be in 14 or 15 states. Unfortunately, it seems like the quality has gone downhill as the chain expanded. Maybe it's just because there are now so many other good pizza options in the Valley but on my most recent visit I was not impressed. The pizza was average at best and definitely overpriced. Plus I feel like the menu used to have more options. I really can't recommend this place anymore when there are so many better places to go.",

The outside patio area is so cute, very close together so it's almost like you don't want to have a conversation because of easy eavesdropping...   I was shocked everything was so \"fancy\" on the menu for the quality which seemed normal to me and for the price and I'm from Scottsdale. It's not an \"I just want pizza\" place, seems like an acquired taste to be honest. The sauce is so super super thin, I had to ask myself several times if there was any sauce. I also asked for garlic and stared at my pizza trying to find it. The crust is like paper, I don't even know... don't get the appeal. I mean I love thin crust but this was crazy.   I also ordered my large pizza with pepperoni and meatball, the pizza was warm but the meatballs were cold, not sure how that happens... to make a long story short my friend and I had only eaten that (and drank water) thus far that day and we both got diarrhea... a few times with aching stomachs. YES, I just said that. No idea what that was about, but it seemed like food poisoning. I got very nauseated myself as well.",

My table was myself and six hungry guys and we got three salads - half of one was left when all was said and done. My favorite was the Caprese with fresh mozzarella.   You pick your own toppings so I made myself the equivalent of a margherita pizza. Scrumptiousssssssssnesss. The personal is definitely for at least 2 people (thus the humor of the portion sizes). All the toppings were fresh, the crust was thin and crunchy - basically a great pizza all around.   Service was great with our big, very undecided party - seriously, none of us could decide anything. Our server was very patient and helpful in narrowing our decisions.   Next time I'm here for work, I'm coming here for pizza!",

That's cool. No big deal. We just forgot about it and sat at the bar.  The bartender greeted us, got us drinks, and took our food order. He didn't check on us much and he kind of left the bar area a lot so he was kind of hard to reach when we were tying to order more alcohol.   We finished our meal, paid-out, and left.

If you now what I mean, you know exactly what I mean.  Grimaldi's never disappoints, but is a tad pricey.  If you add some toppings, you can easily have a $35 pizza on your hands without blinking an eye.  Pricing aside, you can't go wrong for quality pizza.  I also recommend eating in.

Thin crust was amazing as was the antipasto appetizer. Just know this is not your typical antipasto that usually comes with lettuce. No, this has no salad just meat, cheese, and sweet red peppers.

    "text": "I'm not one who eats pizza often but when I do, I want to ensure that it's going to be fabulous!  I just moved to Scottsdale from San Diego and I was craving some pizza today.  It's also a lazy day with it being a holiday weekend, so I wanted something delivered as well.  I love white pizza and I love pesto pizza, so I turned to Yelp to see what I could find.  I was happy when I stumbled across Grimaldi's site and found both options that I liked.  From looking at the images, the bread looked thin and tasty and both pizzas looked good.  I then turned to Doordash in, hopes that they even that out here and was happy to see that they did and that they picked up from here!    If I had to pick between the 2 pizzas, it would definitely be pesto.  When I placed my order I took a shot at asking for half of each type that I liked...why not, it was worth a shot!  The one thing I don't like is burned bread, I know some people love that about pizza but I don't.  I checked to have it lightly cooked and then made a note to not have it burned.  45 mins later, a fabulous thin crust pizza that was half pesto and half Quattro formagio arrived at my door!  It tasted absolutely fabulous :).  I can't speak for the actual location as I had it delivered, but the food gets my vote!  Prices are also reasonable, I paid $11 for a 12\" which didn't have any meat.  For me I could easily share that with another girl, which makes the price even better.  I've also just moved to AZ from CA, so everything here is cheaper!  In addition, they have several other different pizza flavors, starters, salads, desserts and a very extensive beverage list!",

The toppings were pepperoni and mushroom, I could count the mushrooms and for covering the bad quality they had a lot of tomato sauce on top of the pepperoni and the FEW mushrooms. The dough was undercooked. Over all I think dominos has a better quality. I was really surprised to have a pizza this bad specially they charge so much for it.  I post the picture of the pizza I got so you can be the judge of that.",

    "text": "Stopped in on a Friday night during spring training. Thought it would be busy and it was. Put our name in for a table and it was an hour wait. Looked at the menu and opted to get s pizza to go. I wanted a salami and mushroom but salami wasn't listed as a pizza topping. I did see it was an option for a salad tipping which I thought was odd. I asked the hostess if we could order to go. She said sure but when I asked for a salami and mushroom she balked when I told her it was listed as a salad topping not a pizza topping. She said she needed managers approval for that. I shrugged and said fine if that's what's needed. She then went back to her other hostess duties and I stepped over to the bar.   Anyway I watched the game and had a beer. 45 minutes later I walk back to the hostess to check on how much longer the pizza would be. She gives me a lost look and told me she forgot to get manager permission and place the order. Are you kidding me!?!?  I ask her if she can get the order in. She noted she would get right on it. This time I waited at the hostess stand. It took another good ten minutes for the manger to make it to the front. At that point he was surprised and as he said a little embarrassed that salami wasn't listed. He said of course I could have salami. So the order gets in about 60 minutes after my first attempt. I ask to pay for it and was told I could pay when It came up front.   Back to the bar I go. At the bar I noticed folks eating pizza and saw many with sauces on the side for the pizza, others hitting it hard with garlic salt, oregano, parmesan cheese, black pepper and red pepper. I always found it odd that people assault a pizza like that. Later I realized this was largely due to the pizza lacking any flavor, just a light smear of sauce and very little cheese. Nearly an hour passes and I go back to the hostess to ask about my pizza. The manager happened to be there as well and said it's sure taking forever for that pizza. He goes back and of course it was ready. No apology for the delays and was more like lucky you, here's the pizza. Likely spent time parked on the top of the oven. I settle up payment and headed back to the hotel.   OVER TWO HOURS to get a pizza to go!!  Hungry as hell we dive in only to find the pie crust was rubber, likely from being parked in a warmer box, sauce was nearly absent as was the cheese. The salami was so skimpy and the mushrooms we almost nonexistent.   Not sure why folks love this place so much. It's a one and done for me. Never again.",

However, after ordering take out multiple times I can safely say their customer service is sorely lacking. It's definitely one of those places where you get the impression they think they're doing you a huge favor and you're lucky to be eating their pizza. And maybe you are, but that's not the level of service I'm used to in Scottsdale. Tonight our take out order was messed up, despite a phone call and specific instructions. So it's a mixed bag - not my favorite place to get pizza, but a good choice when you want quality pizza to feed large groups.",

    "text": "Pricey BUT we will pay $$$ for great pizza. So...Shockingly Bad!  And who is posting 5 star comments for at least this Old Town Location?  Any frozen pizza out of the box warmed at home would win in a taste test. What happened to the pizza dough? I haven't posted in a while because I get disillusioned by the non foodie posts. But this needs to be done. TAKE A LOOK AT THE PIZZA WHEN YOU WALK IN BEFORE ORDERING!     We first visited Gramaldis in New Jersey in '07 and it was FANTASTIC!  It Tied with Joes on Bleeker St in our personal taste test. We were delighted to try Grimaldis  again 3 years ago at Kierland when visiting Scottsdale. It was not like NJ, but pretty good.   Last night we went again to Old Town. We sat at the bar and the service was good. We ordered the green salad. Terrible. No taste in the dressing. It seemed like it had vegetable oil and maybe a squeeze of lemon. Anyway. No flavor. Than our pizza showed up. Flat, thin, flimsy, and just awful. I'm sorry We ate any of it but we were hungry.   There is no way we will go back. This was not a fluke because all pizzas we saw going by (they were busy) looked the same. No thicker fluffy edge, no slightly charred look, no crispness. No chewy bite. Nothing.  We got back to our room and knew we should have stayed in and just had popcorn rather than eat those tasteless calories. Sad. Moral. Stick with the originals or the Mom and Pop places that still can manage the process. And the recipes.",

We walked to the brewery a couple blocks down, and when we sat down with our beers (20 minutes later) I got a message saying our table was ready! We slammed our beers and ran to the restaurant to grab our table!  We had an incredible waiter who helped us through the menu and we ended up ordering three large pizzas - the Don, The Brooklyn Bridge, and ordered a custom pesto and grilled chicken. It was the perfect amount for all of us and the pizza (as always) was incredible.

I sat with an empty water for a good 10 minutes. It didn't seem like they were short staffed, so not sure what the deal was.  Another note....don't get the table for two in the row by the kitchen and next to the bathrooms. You get the be distracted by the servers drumming at the server station while they wait for orders to come up. You have people standing right behind you if there is a line for the bathroom. You get to hear the servers screaming and carrying on. You may even get dusted with ground pepper while a server swings the grinder around.  I'll be dining at Grimaldi's again.

I ordered two personal 12\" pizzas, one with pepperoni ($12) and another with meatball and ricotta ($15).  For such a basic like pepperoni, it was just okay.  They also skimped on the toppings on the meatball pizza and it was sloppily put together.     Maybe dining in the restaurant makes a difference, but I wouldn't do take out again.  Their pizza is not cheap and I was expecting more from them.",

The same deliciousness goes for the Kale Salad with the Lemon dressing!  My only wish was to have a Grimaldi's in Tucson.  I can't wait to come back to Scottsdale just for this pizza!  In lieu of waiting the three of us ate at the bar.  I suggest making a reservation or the \"no wait\" on line early.  As busy as Veronica was with drink requests, she was attentive, polite and personable.  We couldn't ask for better service.  Our drinks were always topped off without our asking.  Veronica made sure our order was put in timely and made to order.  The restaurant was clean, an easy walk from our hotel, and uncrowded comfortable seating.  On top of great service and great food was great price with the \"Military Discount\"!  Thank You Grimaldi's!",

I've never seen a martini come without olives and have the waitress be surprised we wanted olives....waitstaff seemed overwhelmed even though it wasn't that busy.   Nice to sit outside, people watch and have a glass of wine or beer. Would not partake in the overpriced, oily food or cocktails again.",

It's dimly lit so there is no harsh lighting disturbing you while you eat, and even though it is always packed inside, it's always been nice and private and you can comfortably have a conversation. I usually go for dinner with friends but this time I called in for that special they are running on Monday's for the month of October for a $10 16\" cheese pizza. Wow what a fantastic deal! I called ahead of time and spoke with Colten. He was very nice and took my order. When I arrived, my order was ready to go and I was in and out in about 5 minutes. I could only eat one piece, and froze the rest. I'll now have yummy pizza to hold me over till next Monday :)",

    "text": "What a debacle last night was.   Sure we had a few drinks in us but we were responsible and clear headed enough to decide to get some food in us before bedtime.    It was peak dinner time but there were 2 hosts who told us it'll be about 30 minutes.  We sat at the bar to wait for our table figuring we'd hear them or they'd get us when there was a table.  Apparently not.  What do they need 2 hosts for?   When I asked the bar tender about ordering at the bar since we'd been waiting for our table for almost an hour she said she'd check on it for us.  15 minutes later I was starving and a little more unhappy.  The party next to us at the bar was enjoying their pizza while we were starving and trying to get a pizza for about an hour.  The bar tender who had never really said anything about our table or asked what we wanted says well I dropped off these menus for you.   That was it.  I knew what pizza I wanted to order when I walked in and now over an hour and a half later I was too tired and too hungry to deal with it.  As I think about all the people involved and all the things that could have gone better I get increasingly upset at their treatment of us.  We're young and we're tipsy but not annoying drink people to just shoo this way and that.  You're located in old town for God's sake.    And why are there 2 hosts and why if they don't even look for parties waiting for tables??",

The coal fired oven gives it a unique flavor that you just have to experience for yourself.  They make a killer Caesar salad too, and be sure to save room for tiramisu!  Staff are super friendly, and since we're regulars they always remember us.  Service is prompt even when they're busy.  They do get very crowded at dinnertime so I would suggest either making a reservation or getting there early.  Great place for a night out in Old Town Scottsdale!",

The waitress came out with a huge calzone stuffed to the seams with cheese, peppers, and chicken, accompanied by three pizzas that my party ordered for themselves. The dough was crispy without being too hard, and the filling had the perfect ratio of ingredients. It was big enough that I had to concede defeat and accept taking home part of it as leftovers.   As an added plus, our waitress was a lot of fun to talk to; even though it was pretty busy, she still made enough time to have conversations with us when she would come over.

    "text": "WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY life to date.  To put this into perspective, this is the ONLY Yelp review I have EVER put the effort to write even though I've I've swore I would a dozen times.   Here's the story (grab some popcorn): I put in a simple pizza order to go. Said they weren't busy and it would be ready in 20-25 minutes. I show up almost 35 minutes late, pizza isn't done, no big deal right? Who cares? Wait a few more minutes, this is no issue. They tell me I can find a seat in the bar while I wait. So a server comes out to give me the bill 5 or so minutes later. He comes back for it I tell him to keep the change (generous tip, especially for a to-go order). So I've been here at this point 15 minutes which is 25 minutes longer than the max wait time. Still no issue to me. I'm patient. The server comes to me and apologies and tells me the order was never put in some how. Now believe it or not we still don't have an issue. Idc, I'm very chill and laid back. About another 10-15 minutes go by still no pizza. Guy comes by and again and apologizes, says he doesn't know what's taking so long. Come to find out they forgot to put it in the second time around.  At this point I'm dumb founded but still patient. Not a peep out of me. I figure it will be done NOW in 10-15 minutes. Maybe 20 max! (if you know anything about the service industry, when an order is put in late it's generally put into the front of the line or in this case if something is almost done and the same they will take that one. To give to the person waiting and hurry up the one coming in late). So once my order was late, forgot to put in twice, it still wasn't rushed.  It took another 20-30 minutes to make the pizza.   So let's add this up here: 35 min to get to the pizza,  15 min to wait and take care off the bill and drink a water, 15 minutes for the second wait time to put the pizza in again. Then 20-30 minutes for the pizza to get made. Thats adds up to 85 to 95 minutes for a 20 minute pizza.   Now here is where it got frustrating. FIRST, the server took my money before my pizza was wed brought to me much less even made. I was just going to literally leave about 3 times but remembered I was trapt cause he already took my money. Secondly, during what had to been their worst moment of service ever a manager never came and spoke to me which is a MUST! Even at the crappiest restaurant in the world a manager will come solve the problem.   Then lastly where it become a complete laughable joke was my order was never comped, or discounted, or any freebies offered to make the experience. But the guy offered me a free soda   Save to say I WILL NEVER dine here again and will not only NEVER suggest it I will activity convince people not to go here if asked.   I hope this horrible experience for me had guided you away from wasting your time here and provided you some entertainment in reading.   Oh, and the most important part, the pizza was mediocre at best!",

We got there around 6:30 on Friday night and they said the wait was 35 min so we sat at the bar and got a bottle of wine (Louis Martini cab) but the wait only ended up being like 15 min. We sat down in the dining room and its very loud in there, lots of families and kids, but no big deal. I just wouldn't recommend coming here for like a fancy date night. We started with the Mediterranean salad, a small is a perfect size for 2 or even 3 people, we didn't even finish it. Then we got a large pepperoni pizza and added meatballs. It was so delicious, & we ended up taking half home.",

    "text": "The pizza at Grimaldi's is 5 star worthy, but I have to knock them down one star for their prices. I knew what to expect because I've eaten at a Grimaldi's in Dallas and Charleston before, but still, it's expensive pizza considering they charge $3-5 per topping. What brought me in to this location is that I received a coupon for a Free Large Pizza with 1 Topping for my birthday, thanks to signing up for their email club (Thank you, Grimaldi's)!   Their shaded patio with misters and string lights was a nice spot to dine on a warm weekday afternoon. I was seated and greeted promptly, and checked on appropriately throughout the meal. For food, I had a small Caesar salad which could've been split with someone. Was it good? Yes, it tasted like every other Caesar salad I've ever had. Worth $8? Probably not. I'd prefer a smaller serving size for a smaller price, as $8 felt like a bit much for what it was really worth. The pizza however, was delicious! I love the thin, crispy crust and red sauce. I only had room for 2 slices at lunch, but am eager to have the rest as leftovers! I'd definitely recommend this restaurant for an upscale pizza night.",

    "text": "[First time Out-of-Towner for Spring Training]  Don't believe the hype!!  I could possibly never be allowed back for Spring Training, for saying that, but I wish someone would have warned me! Why does everyone talk about this place? Seriously, after our meal we all agreed Round Table is much better...and cheaper!  We arrived promptly at 11AM when the doors opened, to a stunned hostess, who didn't quite ready to see customers even though the door read \"Open @ 11AM\". Sorry we are prompt, we had a lot to do that day...  After more than 5 people said this was the place to try, we sauntered over here. It was going to happen on our trip, no matter what. Entering the place, it's cute...at best. White and red checkered table cloths, a full bar, and a visible pizza making counter.  Our server was super sweet and very attentive, we were the only customers in there for about 30 minutes. I'm not sure how it would be if the place was packed, but lucky for us we didn't have to worry about it.  The menu is very limited. There are about 6 different salad options, but we all ordered the same one, the Caprese Salad. This salad was refreshing and well prepared. Huge slices of tomatoes and mozzarella, with basil leaves. The table comes adorned with oil and balsamic, so you can add as you please. This dish was on point and we all enjoyed this part of the meal.  Maybe this is how they do it East coast style, so we aren't too familiar, but you get three choices of pizza and a pay for each topping you add...can you say rip off?!? You can choose between 1) Regular (red sauce), 2) White & Garlic, or 3) Pesto. I believe there were four different sizes: personal, small, medium, and large. Then each topping was charged per item. This is a baller-on-a-budget nightmare!  If the taste even came close to matching the price, it would have been decent. But the pizza was lacking in all things flavor and texture. I ordered a personal White and Garlic with chicken. The crust was so thin, it was super crunchy for my liking. The cheese they use was really rubber, no stringy cheese. The chicken didn't really have any extra flavor, it did not seem processed, which was a nice added touch. The others made their own personal sized pizzas, but no one  was impressed.  The size of a personal is huge, if I remember correctly its about 6 huge slices...which most other places that would be a small pizza. So, for portion size they get a high five, but a huge pizza with uninspiring taste didn't bode well with us.  Finally able to try a cannoli, I ordered one for the table. Since I was devirginizing myself to this delicacy, I can't really comment too much on this. The Ricotta filling was good, the little chocolate chips were an added treat...but the pastry part was so hard, I could barely eat it with my fork. Like I said, I have no idea how this is supposed to look like, but it was too crunchy for my bones. I'll try it somewhere else, but I'm still on the fence.  The only reason I can see going here EVER, is the possibility of a Giants sighting. While we were there Jeremy Afeldt came in for lunch with a group, not my choice of sighting, but a Giant nonetheless :)  I heard B. Wilson goes to Oregano's (Pizza Bistro)...just sayin'...",

I am always a fan of thin crust & especially love brick oven pizza so I was pretty let down with just how bad the food really was. The pizza was so unbelievably bland that i contemplated either putting salt on it or dumping parmesan cheese all over it. Even with toppings it was still by far the worst pizza I've ever eaten. There are no appetizers, just salads for starters. I was hoping for bread of some kind to go with my pizza, that was not part of the menu either. It's pizza & salad, that's it.  The atmosphere was okay, pretty loud but their were large parties. Decor was pleasant but our waiter was very pushy & made us feel that we were being rushed. I have had better frozen pizzas... Save your money & go down the street to the pizza & gelato spot.",

After the bartender Hannah talked to us, we decided to stay there to eat. She was super attentive and really friendly and the bar was actually more quiet than the main restaurant.   We had a bottle of the Layer Cake Primitivo, shared a salad and had a pizza with red peppers and meatballs. The pizza (as always) was cooked perfect. Love their thin crust and fresh mozarella.   The manager heard that we had a young baby at home, so he came over to talk about his kids and ours with us. He even comped our dessert! Both he and the bartender were really engaging and fun to talk to without being overbearing. They made our experience a wonderful night out--which is important when you only get one a week!   We've been there with a big group as well, and got our own little dining room that felt like we were all together at someone's home (without having to have someone cook or pick up!).",

So there you have it, if you aren't from NYC and you want an authentic taste of the big apple, or if you ARE from the city and you want to annoy your non- native NYC friends while eating some \"pretty good\" pizza, Grimaldi's in Scottsdale is the place.

As luck would have it, we discovered Grimaldi's had opened a couple locations in the Phoenix area.  He was skeptical it could be as good, but after seeing that they imported the entire concept, including NY water for the dough, he gave it a try and eventuially convinced me to accompany him.  I have to admit, it was excellent.  The very hot, coal oven gave a creat cripiness to the bottom of the thin, NY-style crust.  We ordered two pizzas - one with meat, one with veggies, both were great.  I hate to play into a New Yorker's ego, but in this case, my friend was right, Grimaldi's was excellent.",

When we asked about our salad he just replied with, \"sorry, I forgot.\" He also forgot the extra sauce that we ordered with our pizza. Overall, the pizza was okay at best. It tasted pretty dry, as though it had been sitting for sometime before actually coming out to us. Due to the poor service and mediocre pizza, I don't think we will be eating at Grimaldi's again.",

Visited twice during our recent stay in Scottsdale, arriving around 5PM each time. Immediately sat, great service from Dallas, our waiter. Tried the house salad (ok, I didn't care for the roasted red peppers on it, kinda plain otherwise). But we tried the spinach the next time and even Mr. Muscle loved it. An 18\" pie is around $16 and then you add most ingredients at $2 a pop. So our average pie was $24 with leftovers for later. Pizza is solid, delicious. Nothing is overwhelming, this pie tends to be subtle on different levels. Not loaded down with ingredients (read kinda thin on pepperoni and sausage), frankly, I don't think the crust could stand up to it. But each bite is wonderful when its piping hot. Gotta love a place that just sells pizza - don't walk in here thinking there is any pasta!",

    "text": "Truly disappointing experience. Last Friday (September 15th) was my birthday. Several friends and coworkers (total it was 11 people) planned a dinner at Grimaldi's and a comedy show to follow. Thursday afternoon a coworker called to make reservations. The hostess told her that they couldn't take our reservation, but told her that since we were planning on an early dinner (5:30) we shouldn't have a problem finding seating. First red flag considering we've made multiple reservations in the past without a problem. What the hostess neglected to inform her of was that the manager only allows larger parties to sit together outside. Again in the past, we've never had to sit outside before due to our party size. Um what?! My coworker arrived first, asked to speak to a manager (who was extremely rude) who still refused to push tables together inside. It was 103 outside and we were refused seating accommodations in a then empty restaurant. The manager said that \"larger tables sit for too long\" and thus aren't allowed to sit inside the restaurant. My coworker then explained we had a 7:00 show to go to which would make his argument invalid and he still refused. For someone who is running a SERVICE business, he was certainly lacking in courtesy and accommodation. The only reason this review gets two stars is because of our amazing server (the bartender of the night-- I regret that I didn't get his name) who gladly let us take up three separate tables (because the manager again, rudely informed us that while we could all sit there were could not move the tables together despite his bartenders willingness) and because the food and wine was still great despite the bad taste the manager gave us.",

    "text": "In an unlucky turn of events, I ended up having a grand experience with my new favorite, Grimaldi's.   More of my reviews lately have began with me aimed for one place and ending up at another, and I'll start with \"this one isn't any different.\" Maybe it's a trend, maybe it's indecisive decision making, or maybe it's just plain old coincidence. Mostly because I don't believe in fate; I'll go with coincidence, but for those of you who mystify the universe in a shroud of hocus pocus, wizardry, and magic then feel free to call it fate.  While I make the claim of \"My New Favorite\" I'm not really comparing it to much outside of oreganos, humble pie, upper crust, and streets of new york. I've yet to visit bianco, cibo, and plenty other wild-west, pizza slingers round these parts.  Earlier this week I planed my birthday lunch at Cibo in Downtown PHX. A calorie and carb packed, delicious birthday meal. Much to my dismay, a quick pre-lunch look at the Cibo menu (on their website), seemed to be lacking a certain sauce and cheese covered, carbo loaded delight. After a call in confirming this fear, a fast yelping finger pointed me to Grimaldi's in Scottsdale. It didn't hurt that they had also sent me a voucher for free birthday pizza; I guess my wife signed me up for their email list. :-)  On Sunday afternoon; even though they were busily serving plenty of customers, there was no wait. I placed an order with the server for a manhattan while I checked out their menu. Regretfully I had to send my drink back, it tasted more like straight whiskey, and bottom shelf at that. I decided to go with the house red wine in stead; which was decent and chilled, a bit odd for a red, but it worked out well.  We dined on a large meatball, ricotta pizza and a large mediterranean salad. The salad was huge, big enough for 3 people to share, and each end up with 2 portions. The pizza came out with a perfectly crisped crust, evenly distributed slices or meatball and ricotta, and was delicious!  We finished off our meal sharing a blueberry cheese cake AND a canolie, it was my birthday after all. I cant say that I've had many canolies in my life, but if they're all this good, there will be an eternal place in my heart set aside for these delectible deserts.  Happy dining friends, and godspeed to all your yelping fingers!",

    "text": "My consort and I took my six-year old granddaughter to a puppet show and then to Scottsdale Fashion Square for some shopping. We decided to grab a quick dinner before bringing her home and pizza sounded like the perfect kid-friendly meal.  I wasn't planning to review this eatery, mainly because food reviewers need a break once in a while to enjoy their social engagements--a busman's holiday. Our last experience (read BOUNCED) made us gun-shy. We've been cooking at home for the last three weeks.  We're always looking for good pizza in Scottsdale and I remembered loving the coal brick-oven pie at Grimaldi's a few years ago, so we finalized our restaurant choice and headed south on Scottsdale road. We arrived famished at 5:30 PM to find a quiet Grimaldi's, which was out of character. Most of my visits have consisted of long lines at the door, noisy patrons, and waits of 15-30 minutes.  Our order was simple: a Mediterranean salad and a large pizza with black olives, mushrooms, and onions. The salad came drenched in an overly tart vinaigrette. We told our waitress and she brought us a new dish of greens, dry and tasteless.  The pizza arrived hot and our server dished out our first slices. It didn't taste like I had remembered--crisp crust with a rich flavored sauce. This pizza had a metallic flavor with a damp cardboard texture. The scantily applied cheese made a polka-dot design and the mushrooms were under cooked.  After two slices, my companion took a black object out of his mouth and dropped it onto the pizza tin creating a clang as it hit the metal. He said, \"I bit into a hard, hot rock. It tasted funny.\" We asked for a manager and Lauren came over to our table. We showed her the substance and she immediately identified it as a piece of anthracite coal. She said, \"This happens often, it's just a popped piece of coal from the oven.\"  She acted as if it was a common occurrence and that this type of experience is expected when cooking with a coal brick oven. We then left and within moments my consort complained of a coal burn on the inside of his lower lip.  I examined him when we arrived home (I'm a registered nurse) and found the affected area on his bottom lip. I'd display the photo here, but it's not very appetizing. Needless to say, we were upset with Grimaldi's casual, insensitive handling of this matter. I used to eat at this establishment once or twice a month a few years ago and never experienced this type of incident, service, or food quality. The waitress took the cost of the pizza off the check, but seemed to be indifferent about what had occurred.  We are still on a mission to find a good pizza place in Scottsdale or Phoenix. If you know of any, please send us a name and address and we will give them a try.  I am the DinnerSlut.",

They explained to us the concept of their restaurant and bit of background, which was quick and nice. We got a front row seat to the action, watching the team put together the pizzas with perfect precision.   We ordered a \"personal\" which is a 12'' pizza; that is way too big to be personal! And the toppings!!! Loaded on, not like your mainstream chain pizza place. You will definitely get your moneys worth here at Grimaldi's. The thin crust was perfect for me since I don't like thick crust pizzas.   My friend had the oreo cheesecake, which we found out was handmade daily in store by one of the very talented waitresses.   All in all, the portions are big, the staff is friendly and I can't wait to go back when I get back to Arizona.",

Not only does the food speak for itself, but the service is outstanding.  I am currently at this Grimaldi's location & the pizza didn't live up to the Grimaldi's expectation.  Without hesitation the manager has taken our pizza & made us a new one that surpasses the Grimaldi's status, all with a smile on his face.

A server so lazy that apparently didn't wish to  recall the beers available - hey, just read the menu.    3. Calzone was full of ricotta and cheese.  Nope, no flavor.   4. Garlic pizza was okay.",

We sat outside, next to a group of obnoxious 12+ 40 year old wannabe 20 year old women plus one dude. They kept referring to their one lesbian looking friend as \"Justin\", which was pretty funny because she did actually look like Justin Beiber.  Our waitress was really nice, but the food took like 40 minutes to get out to us and all we really ordered was pizza and a salad. Their white pizza, absolutely disgusting. No flavor. Too flat. Dry. EW.  Definitely not coming back here...",

For a table of two, get the Large!  You will have at least one leftover slice, maybe two.  Toppings are always based on personal preference...I can tell you a couple here that are worth your while.  Kalamata olives and ricotta cheese.  Oh man.  They make the pie.  I also suggest extra sauce, cause sauce is the difference maker on most pizzas.    If you get the pepperoni, they are little mini guys and they get a little crispy on top.  I usually prefer the roni under the cheese, but these guys put it on top to crisp it up a bit.  Traditional NY style cut in wedges that you can fold...with the extra sauce it can get a little sloppy.  I good spot for a late lunch in a great location.",

    "text": "To someone not knowing better, the crowd would indicate that this place is out of this world.  Maybe in a place short on options for pizza, it is.  Since I hail from a town full of Italian immigrants with more great pizza joints than there are gas stations, I wasn't blown away.    So, here's how it went.  There was to be a wait for our table so we made our way up to the bar and ordered a round of drink.  All were served up in a tall glass, but were overly watered down.  The bartender was efficient and attentive, though.    Soon our table became available and we were seating smack in the middle of the main walkway with servers navigating around us all evening.    The menu quickly narrows your options.  No, don't flip it over!  That really is all there is to choose from. Pizza, calzones and a few salads.  Although, there ARE numerous pizza toppings to tack on to your thin crust coal fired oven pizza.     We ordered the caprese salad which was plenty enough to share.  The antipasto is strictly some meats  and cheese laid on the plate with a small assortment of olives and some roasted red peppers.  This is fine, if you're expecting it.    Two personal size pizzas is plenty for four hungry women.  I most enjoyed the ricotta, fresh tomato and pesto combo myself.  Yet, then again, those are three of my favorites.  So pick three of your favorites (or more) and you're likely to come up with a pizza that isn't bad.  The dough isn't memorable and the bottom seemed a tad ashy.    The dessert menu follows suit with the dinner menu adhering to few options including a variety of cheesecakes, a cannoli and tiramisu.  I opted for the plain cheesecake, which was pretty darn good.  It was not overly dense nor was it whipped into a airy substance.   Service isn't stellar, the pizzas are generously sized.  Just add good company!",

This pizza is fabulous! The crust could not be more perfectly thin, crunchy on the bottom, and chewy on the top, and just overall stellar. The toppings were sublime.  I sat at the bar, had a couple of cocktails and the best pizza I've had in forever. The bartender, was a great chic. She new how to be friendly and give great service without feeling forced or phony. I told her I had ridden my bike up there, so she offered to wrap up my extra pizza in tinfoil and put it in a plastic bag, so I could fit it in my basket. I had my purse, so a Styrofoam to go thing would have sucked. Styrofoam sucks anyway, but this would have been a space issue.   Anyway, I love this place mucho, mucho.

    "text": "Pizza just doesn't get any better than this. Though we have traded in the 120 degree heat and urban sprawl of Phoenix for the green and walkable goodness of Portland, I will always look back fondly on Grimaldi's as one of the brightest stars in the dark void representing palatable food to be found in Phoenix.   To be sure, there are better restaurants in Phoenix -- but there are no better pizzas. The topping choices are simple and down-to-earth (no pineapple here!), the way a pizza should be: oven roasted sweet red peppers, ricotta cheese (to die for), sun dried or fresh sliced tomatoes, pepperoni, onions, fresh garlic, Italian sausage, meatballs, pesto, mushrooms, and extras of their base ingredients: mozzarella cheese, basil, and \"Grimaldi's Famous Sauce.\" With these kinds of ingredients, you really cannot go wrong, so have fun picking and choosing!  While we like the \"white\" pizzas with garlic the best, it's not the sauce that makes the difference -- it's the deep, smoky taste of the coal brick oven baked into the thin crust and substantially portioned ingredients. Individual flavors bursting forth from a common shroud of fire.  Grimaldi's also offers a selection of starters, including antipasto and a variety of reasonably priced salads; some hot and cold beverages, including beer; and a few East Coast style desserts like \"New York Style\" cheesecake, cannoli, oreo cookie (invented in NYC in 1912), and tiramisu.    Of course, all the East Coast style pizza and desserts in the world won't change Scottsdale, AZ, into New York City. Indeed, Patsy Grimaldi's exceeds its New York counterparts by catering to the Scottsdale public and providing finer and more spacious dining areas, both inside and out. Service is prompt and always agreeable, even when things get busy. Speaking of which, be sure to make a reservation for larger dinner parties, especially on the weekend.  Though we've left the desert for greener lands, I'm not sure we'll find a local pizza joint that will compare. Goodbye Grimaldi's, we'll miss you.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I stopped by Grimaldi's at the end of a long workday that left both of us unwilling to cook dinner.  I had eaten at a location in Chandler before but that was for a rehearsal dinner so I'm not sure if I had a typical Grimaldi's experience.    We entered the restaurant and were immediately greeted and seated at a two top by the window.  The menu is printed on the placemat and there are plates already placed before you are seated.  I don't mind the placemat menus so much but then why the plates?  You just have to move them to read the menu and on a two top there isn't a ton of room to begin with.  Additionally, there are a LOT of tables packed into that dining room, but that really didn't bother us until we got up to leave.  Walking out was like traveling through an obstacle course.    After we sat, we checked out the menu and the waiter came to take our drink order.  He came back with our drinks quickly and explained the three different pizza options available.  I ordered the white with sausage and my boyfriend had the classic with pepperoni.  Once our pizzas arrived (we didn't wait long), we again had to deal with table space issues.  We each ordered a personal size pie, I think it was 12\".  Our plates were stacked in the middle of the table so we could read the menu, so the server placed our pies in front of us.  At this point the plates were just table decoration.  There is no way we could have used them and put our pizzas to the side.  Not really a major issue but not as smooth as it could have been.    Once we got settled in with the table, we dove in to the pizzas.  I immediately noticed that the crust towards the center of my pizza was very soft and not crispy at all.  I'm not sure if that was a cooking time issue or a sauce/olive oil issue.  The pizza was still quite tasty, but would have been even more enjoyable with a crispier crust.  Cheese and meat quality were great and I really liked the smoky flavor that the coal oven gives the pizza.  I would characterize it as good but not great pizza.  My boyfriend's pizza was closer to great.  From the crust to the sauce to the pepperoni, this pie was spot on.  Everything was very flavorful, especially the sauce. The cheese wasn't too heavy and the boyfriend thinks it may have been fresh mozz.  His pizza was definitely the better of the two.    The waiter came back during our meal to ask about drink refills and was prompt with the bill as we finished.  We took home two slices of white and I'll be glad to have it for lunch tomorrow!  The environment at Grimaldi's is definitely family friendly and good for groups, so I wouldn't suggest it if you are looking for something intimate or quiet.  A beer, soda, two pizzas and tip totaled 39 bucks.  We felt that was a decent price for dinner.  We enjoyed Grimaldi's and would recommend it to friends!",
