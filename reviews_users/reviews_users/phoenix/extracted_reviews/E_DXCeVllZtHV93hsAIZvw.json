I think I will go back and try something else next time.",

I thought to myself, ok, it's possible, it may just be a fluke. I decided to finish my taco with a grossed out feeling. As my girlfriend was wrapping up her meal, she says \"look babe; there's a cockroach.\" This roach was a different roach in obviously in a different location.   I hate to leave a sour review on good food but I cannot help it. I can only imagine when this place closes at night and the lights are off, how many more are grazing the pastures. I won't be back and someone may need to check into this place in regards to rodents and insects. GROSS!",

    "text": "My coworker told me about this place and, being from Tucson, I've been looking for a good hole-in-the-wall casual (and cheap!) Mexican place.  I was blown away.  FOOD: Simple and amazing. The Carne Asada is seasoned and grilled perfect with little gristle. The best surprise of this place is their beans. They have 100% authentic Mexican style refried pinto beans. The kind that takes hours to make and are epic inside a burrito with all other fresh ingredients combined.  SERVER: They're kind and bring out your drinks, food, and condiments -- even though this kind of place isn't expected to. A casual spot like this I would imagine them calling your order and you coming to get it but they serve you, which is unusual but awesome.  AMBIANCE: It's a hole in the wall, but again, I'm from Tucson (so I'm kinda used to this vibe) and I felt right at home with their old DLP big screen TV in the corner playing Mexican soap operas as you eat.   Is it the best scenery inside? No. However, the food will teleport your consciousness to whatever version of heaven you prefer, so it really doesn't matter once you take your first bite. Support this place now!",

They say \"more parking in back\", but it's not immediately obvious how to get to the back.  The building is run down.  Inside, the place is a dive.  Not exactly \"dirty\", but not what one would call well-maintained.  On the wall is a small menu,  Actually, the sign is large, but there are only a dozen or so items on it.  The primary choices are \"tacos\" and burritos.  The tacos are soft open tacos, sometimes called \"street tacos\".  Several meats available.  Asada, pastor, lengua, chicken...  I opted for a combination plate which had some decent refried beans, rice, pastor (pork) and asada (beef).  Normally I give a pass on the beans, but these were tastier than most (I got a sample), so I went with it.  The rice was very good.  The meats were served with warm tortillas.  They were simple, but very good.  From what I know this is really authentic fare.  Not Americanized, just what ordinary Mexicans have in their homes.every day.  It's a bit far from my house in the east valley, but this has made the list of places to go when I find myself in Phoenix.  Be warned, it is cash-only here.",

    "text": "I have Finally found a Taco location worth spending my money at!    I have many friends over the years that would always say \"You need to check this place out\" or \"this other place is sooo authentic\", after listening to many of them and trying out their recommendations, I have come to the conclusion many of my friends are LIARS! ha-ha. I always got directed to trendy horrible places...   I am born and raised here in AZ and am 33 yrs. old now, I have travelled far and wide to find some bomb carne asada tacos and it seemed to be a lost cause until now. Tacos Sahuaro is my new hang out spot for sure! Its located in a strip mall and honestly its pretty sketchy, but these tacos are def worth getting shanked in the parking lot... (Joking, you more then likely will not get shanked)!   Inside the place honestly, It could probably use a deep cleaning. It doesn't smell bad or anything, it could just use a fresh coat of paint, some ambiance, and a Professional tile cleaner. However, I wasn't here for the ambiance... I was here for some tacos!  Tacos are 2 bucks a pop and I ordered 3 Carne asada and 1 chicken, my wife ordered a couple tacos (she was a bit sketched out by the location). We sat down and they brought us some sides like carrots and onions, and some cucumbers, lime and salsas. We got our tacos and I tried the hot hot salsa on my taco and as I took my first bit into heaven I shed 1 tear! This taco was amazing! My taste buds were orgasming (Not literally)!!! The tortilla makes up a lot of the flavor. They double up the corn tortilla and cook the outsides, and insides are doughy. The carne asada was spot on and the hot ass salsa was the topper!!!! I ordered 2 more they were so good. Its a simple shop, tacos burritos and gorditas, no chips (saves more room for tacos).  Set aside the worry of the neighborhood if you want a bombastic taco! This place will not disappoint! Im already planning me next trip this weekend.  **** Update****  I was crazing the tacos so I went back for another visit. This time I learned they will make you fresh corn tortillas for your tacos while I requested and OMG!!!! THEY WERE SOOO GOOD!!! I also tried a Gordita. I was pretty hesitant because I grew up with having just meat inside. I bit into the carne asada gordita and i most passed out because it was sooo damn good (im pretty dramatic, lol). I had to order another one.",

No gloppy chedder cheese mostly cotija cheese (the white crumbly kind that looks like feta).  Of course they also have chicken, pork and beef if you prefer.  Pay the lady, cash only of course. Nice selection of mexican style juices including horchata and that hibiscus red stuff or cans of soda.   Once you sit down the server will bring you carrots, cucumbers and a dish of some fiery hot crushed chili's in oil. Real addicting if you dig hot stuff,and I do. Your order will be brought out.  Worth a try if you are tired of plates of mystery dish put under a salamander to melt the half pound of Cheddar used at so many sad mexican places in phoenix.",

    "text": "Bar none, Tacos Sahuaro has the most authentic Mexican tacos I have ever eaten in the states, and I cannot get enough of them!!  Everything about the food and experience at Tacos Sahuaro reminds me of when I go to the family taquerias in Mexico.  When you go in, you order with the cashier by picking your meats and what you want it in (tacos, quesadilla, torta, etc).  You then pick a seat, and a server will bring you a dish of cucumbers, radishes and limes along with 2 salsas and a homemade chili oil to munch on until your food comes out (which is never long).  And let me tell you, everything is lick your lips, kiss the air, and squeal with delight flavorful and delicious!!  My favorite 2 meats are the carne asada and the pastor.  I can't even describe how juicy and tasty they are....you just have to trust me.  Everything comes out piping hot with fresh onions and cilantro on top, and it is utter perfection.  And to note: I'm pretty sure they make their red salsa with spicy crack in it, because I sweat and need more of it every time I go ;)     If you are looking for a True authentic taco experience, then you better run over to Tacos Sahuaro and get ready to chow down!",

Staff were very friendly and the service is fast. I have had tacos in Mexico city DF and the carnitas ones here rival the ones from the homeland. Very simple menu, clean, what it makes up in older building looks, it makes up in deliciousness. Must try.",

They have tortas, tacos, burritos, quesadillas and so on.  I had their chorizo taco and carne asada quesadilla and they were seasoned well and done perfectly.  Especially, the carne asada, it was moist, flavorful, all-around good with a little kick.  My wife had their burrito and taco in head and lengua meat and she liked hers.  I also had a Mexican bottle Coke which is always refreshing and good.  My wife's sangria out of the bottle drink was not good; we thought they made their own sangria.  If only Seattle had good Mexican food. (sighs)",

I was excited to find this place even though the waits can be long its worth it they always have homemade fresh frescas to choose from melon, horchata, lime, etc....  I have tried the tacos, gorditas, quesadillas, and sopes all GOOD  The bad is the place is a little older, the wait can take some time and the chicharron taco is not like any I have ever had.  All worth it because they are way better than abythibg else I have had in Phx.  Now all i need to find is a place with adobada cut off the revolving spigot. Where are you?",

Grilled fish on corn tortillas with lots of lettuce, pico, and cilantro. The seasoning was perfect, and you've gotta have the chile verde sauce on top. I really appreciated that it came out to me steaming hot off the grill-- nothing is worse than barely warm food. Even the complementary carrot slaw was yummy. My husband got the burrito and said it was good-- but didn't rave over his meal as much as I did. On top of it all, the Mexico vs Jamaica soccer game was on which made for a fun atmosphere.

We even did an event with 15 people, so I stopped by the day prior to ask how to handle it.  Just had to call in order early and it was all ready and organized on time.  Great service! It can be a long wait for your order if they are busy, so just fyi.  Salsa is very spicy, very flavorful!  Great stuff all around.  They now have horchata too.  Haven't tried it yet though.",

    "text": "This is my new fav place! It is definitely a hole in the wall. The menu is a little hard to decipher because it just has the basic item and prices. There are no descriptions or information about what comes on/with each option. The tacos are wonderful! I love the fresh tortillas. I was a little surprised that they only had onions and cilantro on them. I think some guacamole or cheese might make them better, but maybe that is purely an American thing. There is plenty of room and big tables in the dining area... Not the fanciest, but functional. There are a couple of TVs, but they have been on the Spanish channel every time I've gone in. They charge $.50 for credit transactions. There is a sign on the door that is all in Spanish, so I'm not exactly sure what it says, but I think that it is indicating that your car may be towed if you park in the spots designated for the business to the right of Sahuaro Tacos. There is additional parking behind the restaurant.",

I probably wouldn't get the chorizo again because there's just something about it for me that feels more 'breakfasty' but it was still great. The salsas were spicy without being overwhelming and I loved the crispy, grilled soft tacos. Not much to look at inside but we will definitely be back for the food. At $2/Taco I would've been fine eating just 2 and 3 1/2 put me over the edge! Definitely recommend it!",

I finally found this place, and although it took about an hour to drive here, I decided to give it a shot. When I walked in the woman behind the counter greeted us (my significant other and I) with a smile. I looked at the menu and saw that they indeed sell Tacos De Lengua. My day was made, a plus one for that. We ordered 8 tacos (4 Tacos De Lengua, 2 Tacos De Cabeza  and 2 Buche.) and a drink. We sat down and the woman behind the counter brought us condiments (chili paste oil, green and red salsa, and carrots and jalapenos.)  When she finally brought us our food, the tortillas looked fresh made and the meat looked perfect. Let me just say this: IT WAS AMAZING. So worth the drive down there.  The red salsa was mouth watering, it had a nice kick to it.  Overall, the experience was amazing. We will be going back soon.",

    "text": "I am always down to have a taco, burrito or anything Mexican like.  Our last night in Phoenix and we wanted Mexican food.  We stayed way too long at the bar in our hotel and it was getting pretty late since we had to wake up at 5 to board our plane back to Seattle.   My husband found this restaurant on yelp and we made the 5 minute drive to a very sketchy and dark building.  One reviewer indicated that you would miss the building since it doesn't have an actual sign.  They didn't lie.  I had my gps so I was looking for it but you can easily pass this place up in the dark or light.  Let's be honest, this area is not the best but who cares as long as the food is good and your car isn't stolen when you leave out the restaurant.  There is not a waitress so you look at the board and present your order like Burger King.  Please note that board on the wall has different items than the paper on the counter.  I had my order all ready (lengua burrito and a cabeza taco) but when I got to the counter, the paper had some other items to choose from.  I ended up with the lengua burrito, cabeza taco and a chicharron taco. My husband ordered chorizo taco and the carne asada burrito.  The food came out quick and looked good.  My burrito was pretty small but filling.  The ratio of meat to other ingredients wasn't bad.  I wish I had said no beans (which I usually do) but it was too late.  The beans overpower the delicate lengua.  The chicharron taco was ok.  Sometimes, chicharron gets cold pretty quick so that was the issue.  The cabeza was pretty good too.  Overall, a good taco shop.  It is the best, hecky no.  Is it better than anything in Seattle?  That would be a yes.   The only downside would be the Sangria.  It came from a bottle and it was pretty horrible.  Why I did that to myself, I still don't know.",

However, there are other restaurants and dives just as close or closer that I've only been to once. TS definitely won me over. The first time I went in, I did what I normally do at a new taco joint and got 4 different street tacos. They were all delicious, and the carne asada definitely stood out as the best. The tacos came with fresh onion and cilantro, red and green salsa, a spicy dark salsa, and a bowl containing lime wedges, radish, peppers, and cucumber. All for $2 per taco. Brilliant. I've been too many times to count (check ins not reflective of actual visits), and tried almost everything on the menu. The carne asada is still my favorite, but I often switch it up. Also, their horchata is killer if you can get it. It doesn't last long during the day. The only thing I don't enjoy about the place is the $0.50 \"transaction fee\" for using a credit card. I think that's a load of it for businesses today, but I also don't like carrying cash, so it's the price I'm willing to pay for the best tacos in Phoenix. Truly, if you haven't been there yet, give it a shot.",

They gave me four salsas and a baggie of carrots, jalapenos, lines and cucumbers. Nice touch!",

I also tried a chicharron gordita which was the favorite thing I had. The tortillas are a bit greasy so be prepared for that.(Maybe ask them to warm them up without oil if you prefer that). Overall this place was good. I loved that they bring you veggies to your table, including limes, cucumbers, and pickled carrots/onions. Great place with authentic Mexican tacos!",

There were tostadas, quesadillas and tacos on the table and every single one of our meals was delicious.  The flavor was great on my pastor quesadilla. It wasn't fatty and greasy like many quesadillas I've had. Instead it was subtle and sweet and citrus-y. I often grow bored of quesadillas after a few bites, but this one made me wish I had ordered two. The pickled vegetables and salsa that come with the meal are a perfect compliment to the delicious plates.   Tip. Bathrooms have no AC",

Cashier/waitress was super friendly and attentive.  No frills but delicious. Between the two if us we had taco, tostada, and burrito.  We tried all the meats. The best \"street tacos\" I have experienced this side of the boarder we love cilantro and there was lots on the tacos. The tostada was also delicious piled high with garnish. The burrito was also good but our least favorite of the three items.   As for the meat we liked the carnitas and carne asada the most. Very well seasoned and finely chopped.  Being \"no frills\" they do not have air conditioning. We sat beneath the swamp cooler vent so we were pretty comfortable (it was a hot August day)",

I just wish that their carne asada meat was more flavorful and not burned to a crisp.  If the meat itself was juicier, better seasoned, and not cooked past medium doneness, the tacos would have been awesome.  Overcooked meat notwithstanding, I would return again because I liked the pleasantness of the staff and the authentic vibe of the food and the space itself, and just hope that the carne is prepared to my liking the second time around.  The corn tortillas, however, were awesome, as they were chewy with the right amount of blackened char and riddled with delicious spots of crispiness.  The salsas were also tasty, with the red sauce in particular being really spicy, even to my heat-accustomed tongue.    The pollo asada, carnitas, and al pastor tacos were good.  I'll come back and give their carne asado tacos another try.",

Nevertheless, the pertinence is in the food, not the atmosphere. I ordered the quesadilla with Al Pastor and the cheesy and meaty goodness was encased in a perfectly golden-brown and fragrant corn tortilla. In addition, I ordered the Carne Asada tacos which were great as well. I would recommend the Carne Asada and the Al Pastor as the two meats that are a must-try here because both had a great char from the griddle/grill and were not overly seasoned to the point where the natural flavors of the meat are overshadowed. The complimentary pickled vegetables were a great palette cleanser to the two items I ordered as well. I also recommend washing all of this down with an Agua Fresca- I ordered the pineapple flavor- as a great way to balance out the heaviness from your meal.  Overall, this place is a gem hidden in the outskirts of Phoenix!",

I am picky at Mexican food because I have had great food. So me giving 4 stars means a lot.   I would have given 5, but the fact they charge to use a credit card is my reason for the deduction.

My favorites are the lengua and carne asada tacos, but my parents love their burritos (all of them, which is saying a lot for a traditional first-gen Chinese couple) and their quesadillas are spot on.

The restaurant is nothing fancy, but it has plenty of seating inside and most importantly serves up delicious tacos for only $2 each. The tacos are made with with two freshly cooked tortillas, your choice of meat, chopped onions and cilantro. The tacos are also served with a selection of fresh veggies to cleanse the palate - sliced cucumber, picked carrots, onions, and jalapenos if you want to kick it up a notch. The green chile and red salsa were good, but not the best I've ever had.   At the suggestion of other Yelpers, I tried the Al Pastor, Carne Asada, and the Carnitas Tacos. The three tacos were quite filling because they come double wrapped in two tortillas. The Carne Asada Taco didn't have a lot of flavor on its own - probably would've been good with some fresh guacamole - but the Al Pastor Taco was delicious!   Also, if you order a Coca Cola be prepared for \"un medio litro - that's half a liter! They didn't have Horchata when we visited, but they have a wide selection of Jarritos drinks (mango, tamarindo, lime).",

Located on a busy street, this place serves up some delicious grub.  The service here was great. The young lady at the counter was helpful in menu options and patient with explaining them. It's apparent that it is family owned and operated; something one could appreciate. Small and original. You can tell that its been there forever. The place is old but they keep it clean.   We ordered Carne Asada and Chicken tacos. The meats were very well seasoned on both. Each tortilla was grilled to perfection and filled from edge to edge with meat, onions and cilantro. Everything tasted homemade. The side carrots and jalapenos are pickled in-house and were absolutely delicious! The red salsa was tasty but a little too hot for my tongue; Mr. B. loved it. I prefer the green chile salsa as it added additional flavor to my chicken tacos. We took our order to go and arrived home to food that was still pipping hot (huge plus).  We will definitely come back and try other options. If you're in the area, Tacos Sahuaro is a place you won't be disappointed in.",

We came in and ordered takeout which consisted of menudo, a quesadilla, and a Carne Asada burrito. They do not have fountain drinks or ice, and it is bottle or cans only.   Our order took about a half hour to come out. When we got home the burrito was tender and seasoned very nicely, and it had a nice smokiness to it. The quesadilla was good, but I don't know how anyone could really mess up a quesadilla. A little bit of cilantro on the inside added a nice touch. The menudo had a nice broth with plenty of tripe. I would've preferred a little bit more hominy in it, as it had a lot of tripe, but I guess generally the complaint is that there isn't enough tripe. It came with all of the general fixings: onions, cilantro, red pepper paste, and limes. I look forward to returning here again, but perhaps a bit earlier and maybe not on a Sunday.",

Its got such a great flavor and the perfect crunchiness.   The also supply you with plenty of limes, cucumbers, spicy carrots and onion garnish, as well as three different sauces you can add (green, red, and a customizable hot sauce; I.e. the more you stir it up the hotter it is). I definitely suggest adding them all, even the carrots and onions go great on or with the tacos. The tortillas are incredible as well, they're fried just right and super fresh.   Now for the cons, the neighborhood is a little sketchy and parking can be difficult since theres only one row of parking between the businesses and 32nd St. Its definitely not fancy in any way, but the food is fresh and done well.",

    "text": "Tacos Sahauro has been on my list for awhile now. For the most part, it's your standard taco joint that sort of falls in the middle between the bottom of the barrel cheap tacos and the more upscale joints that keep popping up in Phoenix.  At two dollars a taco, you're actually getting a lot of food. All tacos were heavily packed with meat, which many people probably appreciate. My girlfriend and I tried the asada, pastor, and a chorizo. Additionally, I ordered a bare-bones cheese quesadilla.  Quality of the tortillas and meat is fine, although nothing I'd really call spectacular in comparison to other places. The oil they provided is decent, but insanely spicy, so be very careful. You'll receive plenty of limes and cucumbers without even asking, which should always be a no-brainer regardless. The quesadilla was just kind of bland.  The restaurant itself, even with its air conditioner, is freaking hot! And despite its grade-A cleanliness that people keep mentioning for some reason, their bathroom is anything but. Not that that factors into the quality of the food, of course.  Overall, you can do a lot worse than Sahauro if you're searching for good tacos, but dare I say, you can also do better if you do your research.  In the end, they're okay, but probably not a place we'd return to.",

The asada was dry and greasy and the cabeza just didn't have flavor. My bf didn't enjoy his food either. Everything was just too greasy, not enough flavor, and it felt like our food had been sitting there for a while because it wasn't warm when we got our food. The people are super friendly though, but service was pretty slow.",

Moreover, they don't need them since their food is quite terrific. Service is incredibly quick and flavors are on point! I was really excited to see that they have mini quesadillas. My beef with quesadillas is that the portion size is generally too big to order anything else. But with mini quesadillas, you get to sample the same thing with lesser commitment.   I placed an order for al pastor taco and pollo mini quesadilla. We got seated and the server brought over a couple of stone ramekins with all kinds of pickled goodness and two kinds of salsas! The food arrived shortly and we were not disappointed. The corn tortillas tastes incredibly fresh and there was an explosion of flavors with both the taco and quesadilla. If you're in a rush, this place is perfect. I would certainly return!",

Their two sauces, green (mild) and red (hot) are both flavorful. The red is smoky and quite hot, gringos be warned. Beans are great, they tasted like love went into them. Also, they double-tortilla their tacos, which is primo. Three tacos are filling, four is too much for this lightweight.",

    "text": "Located on the NW corner of Oak and 32nd St.  Cash only.  Straight dive taco joint.  Dirt parking lot and stating the inside is basic is an understatement.  The floor is tore up, the walls are a yellow painted wood paneling, the ceiling looks patched together, there are random tables and chairs.  Some are plastic Costco picnic type, others look like random wood tables and chairs someone donated.  If your kids opened a taco stand with left over furniture you had in your garage this is what it would look like.  There is a flat screen in the corner and a donated looking wall unit displaying sodas next to it.  The menu is pretty basic.  Tacos, tortas, burros, etc with meat options such as, al pastor, carne, pollo, carnitas, chorizo, lengua, cabeza, etc.  I ordered 5 tacos to cover all the bases and get a feel for the flavors and execution.    First I had the al pastor.  The tacos were a good handful.  Not an extraordinary amount of meat but they filled the tortilla well.  The tortilla was crisped up a bit and while being soft corn they cook gave it a nice crunchy texture.  The al pastor was hot and freshly heated.  The seasoning was lackluster.  It was hard to tell it was actually al pastor by taste alone without looking at it.  Next I tried the carne asada.  The meat was very dark colored and had been reheated more than once.  The chorizo was third.  Good flavor and excellent chorizo.  Slightly on the salty side but the best meat of them all.  The pollo was good straight forward simple grilled chicken.  The carnitas was last and probably my least favorite.  Very bland, dry, and needed a tremendous amount of salsa and lime to throw back.    Flavor wise everything tasted reheated and the seasonings were a bit dull.  I put lime and continuously applied salsa.  The salsa was tasty.  Especially the orange one.  Nice heat and balance and I would have eaten it on anything that came out of the kitchen.  The crisped tortilla shells were the highlight of the meal.  They were crunchy and pliable.  The young lady at the counter was very nice and provided good quick service.  Price wise the tacos were $2 dollars each.  While I wouldn't give it a second thought other than to mention it in the review we aren't talking about a great value here.  I would recommend a make over of the inside.  If you are going to use cheap tables at least make them uniform and a splash of paint on the walls and making the ceiling one solid texture would do wonders.  I would trash the dusty candy stands, throwback wall unit the sodas are displayed on, and the other tube tv in the far corner.  Put some covers on the lights and tone down the volume on the tv.  Foodwise, I would make the meat fresh to order.  I realize thats not possible with carnitas and al pastor, but it is for chorizo, carne, and pollo.  For the other two I would add more seasoning and at minimum make fresh once a day.    I probably wouldn't come back again but still feel it's worth a try if you are nearby.  Best of luck.",

As any good hungry person would think, Taco Tuesday.  We found Tacos Sahuaro and noticed that Yelpers loved this place.  We came and it definitely had the look of an awesome hole-in-the-wall taco shop which gave me a sense of ease and excitement.  I decided to get 4 tacos, even though the quesadilla and the tortas looked awesome.  I was sad to hear they were out of the pollo asado, but i take that as it must have just been delicious.  I instead got the Carne Asada, Pastor, Lengua, and Chicharron.  All were just absolutely FANTASTIC!  I was pleased to see that they either fry their tortillas or they're just housemade b/c they were just awesome!  The texture was thicker than usual, but still nice and soft and and just tasted fresh.  I will say that my least favorite of my four was the Chicharron, the reason being was that the skin was not crispy as I had initially expected.  The skin was soft and perhaps I am mistaken that it was supposed to be fried, but that was my reasoning behind that.  The pastor or the lengua were probably my favorite.  The flavors of each are just so distinct and are just on point.  They also have the verde y rojo sauce which are both on point and last but not least they gave us a bowl of limes and cucumbers which enhanced the flavors just that much more.  I will definitely be going back for some delicious Mexican food :)   Salud!",

If you are in Phoenix for a few days and you want real Mexican street tacos this should be your destination. When we first walked in, the large drink barrels caught my eye. We got the cucumber water which had lime and kiwi in it... Amazing! The pina was great too. I had the carne asada tacos and pastor tacos. I don't know what the carne asada meat was marinaded in but it had a beautiful caramel flavor. The tortillas were hand made and a little bit crispy. This is my new place! I love it! Wow!",

The other two (Pastor and Chicarrone) had absolutely no taste whosoever and the texture left a great deal to be desired.  Will NOT repeat for another try, too many other alternatives.",

Little odd with no menu except what is written on the walls so it's a little hard to make a decision on what you want when they ask you at the counter for your order.   On this visit I had the carne asada burrito and my lunch companion had the Carnitas. My lunch companion really enjoyed her dish.  However, the Carne Asada just wasn't very good. The Carne Asada was very small pieces of overcooked beef that lacked flavor and seasoning.  The burrito was a disappointment.    Overall, the service was good and the food just fair..",

We see this place open until 11 pm on their page, so we drove from the airport really thinking we'll grub some food and go to our hotel, right? Wrong again!! We get there at 10:40 on and the ladies told us they're closing for the evening. WHAT? Very rude and unprofessional. We're glad we don't  have to come back to this place. Ever!!!!!",

I came way after the lunch hour to make sure that there would be a place to park, as I had seen in a Google map street view that parking in front of the eatery is extremely limited. The interior of the place is clean and very basic, with two big-screen TVs on each end of the dining area showing some variety shows. I ordered asada, lengua, carnitas, and pastor tacos and a glass of horchata to wash it all down. The tacos were mostly OK, though one of them had a \"reheated meat\" taste. The cool cucumber slices and pickled carrots on the side were a nice touch. The horchata was pretty standard but refreshing. As is typical of most street taco places, the food was very inexpensive. I do not regret coming here but I would prefer to go to other street taco places next time the taco craving hits.",

The place was empty at noon midweek and you order at the counter and the cute counter girl brings you the tacos and a green and smoky red sauce with a kick in a cold squirt bottle. These are way above normal drive-through salsa taste and leave a great aftertaste. The Carne Asada tacos were stuffed pretty nicely with meat (onions and cilantro are your choice) and the tortillas were griddled and laid down double so nothing ever fell apart. I started with two and had to return for dos more. English is spoken here, but all the customers that day were of the Mexican origin. The counter girl was very sweet, even pointing out some cilantro on my face as I ordered for the second time. Now that is good service.",

Location is . . . unimposing?  That's one way of putting it.  Another way is it is a bit scary.  Yes, you can order in Spanish.  That doesn't, however, make it a 5-star joint.  Not all that well-maintained . . . much like the surrounding neighborhood.  We came on a Sunday when there was hardly anyone there . . . and we were more than a little nervous parking our car and walking in.  I don't have anything really bad to say about the food . . . I will applaud their effort.  I can safely say, however, that the taste was not of the \"died and gone to heaven\" variety attributed to them by so many of the 5-star reviews they have been awarded.  I would say give them a shot . . . not bad, but not great.  They have menu items other than the regular \"burrito / chimichanga\" fare that so many folks think constitutes \"real\" Mexican cuisine, but not, in my opinion, meriting a special trip.",

They all pair so well with their complementary pickled veggies too (carrots and onions). I highly recommend the pastor - probably the best I've had in Phoenix and I've tried a handful of places around here. And don't forget the agua frescas!! My fiance and I always split 3 large agua frescas between the two of us. Sometimes I even just go here for the drinks.  In addition to the great tasting food, their service is quick and their staff is super friendly! I've dined in and ordered takeout, either option will produce your food as quickly as possible. When I plan to order takeout, I usually call ahead to put my order in and they always have it ready within 15-20 minutes.  All prices are extremely reasonable and the portions are generous. Parking is plentiful and there's a lot of seating, good for big and small groups. Definitely worth stopping by if you're in the area.",

And also because this hot (temperature), pregnant momma didn't want to cook.   After you order and sit at a table, they bring you a bowl of cucumbers and limes, spicy carrots/onions/jalapenos, and hot sauces. Yes, please! Cucumbers and hot sauce are now a favorite snack of mine.   We ordered tacos (of course) and I chose: pollo, carne asada, and al pastor. OH MY GOODNESS, the al pastor was my favorite. It was seasoned so well. But what I loved about their tacos is that they're so simple - tasty tortillas (i'm guessing homemade), meat, onions, and cilantro. Then, you can add hot sauce and other goodies to them if you'd  like. The flavors are so well balanced that you don't even need all the toppings (and this is coming from a sauce freak). We also ordered a side of rice and beans and their beans were amazing as well.   We will absolutely be back to this hidden gem! It is so clean and the service is friendly. If you love authentic tacos, you'll love Tacos Sahuaro.",

I've been to several Mexican restaurants in Phoenix and Tucson area and I have to say that Tacos Sahuaro is my favorite. Don't be discouraged by the exterior and interior of the building.

However, as I stated, they charge .50 cents per credit card transaction (which is already a bunch of bull). I placed my order and saw they had fresh pineapple juice. I asked to add that to my order but instead of adding the juice to my order she charged me two different transactions on my card! I told her it was a bad move but she didn't care and gave me some BS about the cost and blah, blah, blah. Taking cards is the cost of doing business. Don't think I'll be going back. Sucks because they do make good tacos but I'm a stickler for service and fairness.",

Got 3 asada tacos and 3 pork tacos. Came out very hot! Ate the pork first, lots of good flavor in there. They give you all kinds of fixins for your tacos! Pork was very good. Then the asada tacos. They were ok, kind of bland so you need to flavor it up with everything. Still everything was very good, you can tell they have good quality meat and products. I will come back.",

    "text": "If you were to do some sort of criminal mapping of my eating habits you could probably figure out via some simple deduction where I work. This is mostly due to eating at places around where I conduct business. And when I find a good place to eat, a truly consistent experience, I go there a lot. This is one such place.  Don't be afraid. The lack of windows and barely there front door are a little intimidating at first but keep pushing through that fear. Once inside, don't let the mixed combination of collapsible Lifetime chairs with the wood chairs your grandparents used to own intimidate you. Also, the air conditioner on the wall's drain tube has always been routed down the wall down to well, I don't know where. Also, I hope you like Spanish soap operas because if you go for lunch that is the only thing you are about to watch on the circa 1990's rear projection television in the corner. Pleasantries aside, let's get to the food.   As you have probably already deduced, this is Mexican food. And good Mexican food at that. You can choose from several different offerings such as your standard tacos, burritos, and quesadillas. There are many other offerings such as tacos de Pastor and gorditas as well but I will concentrate on my favorites; tacos, burritos, and quesadilla. I am a basic man that likes to try everything on the menu once and the stick with what really grabs me. The real basic here is that the carne asada is brilliant and the chicken is not far behind. The carne asada is chipped small, spiced perfectly, and has just a little bit of grease left on it. The chicken is a little charred from the grill, also perfectly spiced, and I am pretty sure picks up a little of the carne asada's grease. This isn't a bad thing. Just pick one of these two proteins and the rest takes care of it self. In tacos they are accompanied by wonderful cilantro, pico de gallo, and creamy crumbled cheese. In the burrito you can choose from beans, rice, the same pico de gallo, or whatever normal filler you are used to such as sour cream or guacamole. I always get a mini or full size quesadilla in addition to the tacos or burrito because they are wonderfully cooked and immensely savory. The flavor is not like anything that I really can compare it too. They are unique. No real wetness that you get from some places where it drips out the bottom of the tortilla. Not here. It's always hot and it's always good. Consistency is really the last word at Taco Sahuaro.  I wouldn't be painting the full picture if I didn't mention the rest of the experience. Sit down where you like after ordering food and soon you will be served a bowl of limes, radishes, pickled carrots, and what I can only deduce is some sort of sustained lava compound to be applied to your taco, burrito, whatnot when it arrives. I tasted the lava compound once. Once. You will also get two squeeze bottles for green and red sauce each of which is tasty and a little warmer than I typically like. Used sparingly, I find it a good accompaniment to the main dish. You can also get those wonderful, sugary authentic Mexican Cokes that are becoming more and more ubiquitous around town. The staff is as friendly as they can be while running around making sure everyone gets their food hot and fresh.  All in all, I would recommend Taco Sahuaro. I have been here quite a bit and that is because when no one can decide on where to go, the easy choice is Taco Sahuaro because it is a known quantity. It is going to be hot, fresh, and delicious. It has never failed on this task so it will be in the rotation for a long time to come.",

The tacos are filled with tons of meat and are very tasty, tender and affordable. Ordering 2-3 tacos is a good portion for one person (with a normal appetite) and I also recommend getting a homemade horchata as well! You'll spend less at this taco spot than at Taco Bell and Del Taco and will get tastier food. Plus you'll get a little bit of street cred coming into this authentic Mexican joint. At Taco Bell and Del Taco? You get zero street cred. One more thing - be sure to bring cash, because if you use your credit card there is a convenience charge. And that convenience charge could go towards your future taco fund!",

The others were yummy. Though using factory-made corn tortillas, they do grill one side into some golden brown char that both seems to strengthen the tortilla as you squeeze it, but adds a nice extra to the taste.  Both house salsas were just meh....one verde and one rojo. I saw no other options, so I just ate most of the tacos without any.   While not bad, I'd only stop here again due to severe weather. Why? Right around the corner is The Tacos Saguayo coach, at 28th st and MCdowell offering a much better product at the same, or even less cost....with a GREAT house red and green salsa offering...Plus, though seated outside under canopy, you at least get some airflow, sadly lacking inside TS.",

The corn tortillas are the best I've ever had.   They must use black magic to make the tortillas or maybe they fry them in crack.  Whatever it is I don't care there is no better tortilla on the planet. If you come here, and you would be crazy not to, make sure whatever you get has a corn tortilla you won't be disappointed.  The menu is tiny but they will basically make you whatever you ask for.  I always ask for vegetarian tacos (beans, lettuce, tomato, cheese and cilantro).  $2 per taco it doesn't get any better than that. Plus they give you cucumbers, limes, pickled carrots, onions and jalapenos with each order.  p.s. ask for the spicy salsa its pretty spicy but has great depth of flavor.",

Try the cantaloupe: it has pieces of cubed cantaloupe in it. So refreshing. Prices: two bucks fifty per taco, three per if you order tongue. Try them out and enjoy!",

    "text": "So let me start by saying these people are graded an A business so it's clean. The food I had was so flavorful and non standard. They have their own flare for their food and it is just brilliantly delicious. Hand made tortillas are spectacular. It's not a pretty restaurant but again it's clean and the food is great. It is worth the trip in I don't care how snooty you might be take the food to go because it is so worth it. We didn't take pics they would look like these others so what's the point we shoulda taken a pic of our happy faces. The location is the only drawback really. There is more parking in the rear but how to get there is not clear. The front lot sucks. If the relocated but kept the food as is they are 5 star eatery.",

    "text": "Don't let the neighborhood deter you from coming to this diamond in the rough. Tacos are fresh and tasty. I live in Scottsdale and struggle to find a legit taqueria that's not on the west side. Well look no further because Tacos Sahuaro will save you the trip. Did I mention I work a mile from here? This maybe my go to lunch spot from now on. It's that good. I think I might have cried tears of joy as I scarfed these bad boys down.   You walk in and there's a menu board with their offerings. Not a huge selection, but that doesn't matter when all you want is a taco. Screw Taco Tuesday. Fridays are where it is. ANYWAYS. I can't remember what else is on the menu because I was mesmerized by the selection of meats. I got my usual...    I ordered 4 tacos because I love to eat. Was it necessary? Absolutely. I got carne asada, pollo asado, carnitas and cabeza (i.e. Brain). I also ordered a Jamaica cuz it's my fave. They had horchata and another fruit agua fresca.   Once you order you take a seat where ever. They will bring you a red and green salsa, a pasty looking red salsa in a baby molcajete (danger zone heat in that sucker), and then sliced cucumbers, radishes and lemon wedges in a bigger molcajete.   Then the moment I was waiting for arrived...taco time! The corn tortillas look homemade. Not sure if they are but they were delish. I topped my first taco with the green salsa and a squeeze of lemon and proceeded to take a bite. Love at first taste. It got progressively better after the first one.   So if you're on the fence about this place, don't be. It's legit.",

In my whole I have never been denied, in eating at a restaurant that is still open, tacos de apastor are super GREASY!! So if u want food poisoning come here!

If only it were here, it would be our daily stop. The authentic beverages are excellent, as well. Cannot wait for next March, when we can fit in a little baseball w our fav Mexican restaurant.",

Truly basic interior, swamp cooler (you'll fall asleep if you sit at the table under the blower on a summer day) and pretty basic menu, but with treasures that rock - the only thing I've ever tried is the Al Pastor, which is the best I've ever had.  On gorditas, or in any other form, it is awesome.  Cash only, no soda fountain - bottled drinks only (but good selection of Mexican sodas and juices).  Occasionally they have some Horchata brewed, but not very often.",

I had one of each, un taco de lengua, uno al pastor, uno de cabeza y uno de tripas. They are big and are served on two tortillas along with a bowl with limes, cucumber and radishes. They were delicious!!! Its hard to find a good place that has Tacos de tripas and this is one you must try. (Cash only)",

    "text": "A hidden gem.  Without a doubt, the best street tacos in Phoenix.     I usually don't go for street tacos because that's just code for baby sized tortillas with skimpy fillings.  Not so!  Small (not tiny) tortillas come loaded with the good stuff.  Fresh toppings and your choice of meats-- asada, carnitas, and many more.    They do chicken right.  I can't remember the last time I had chicken at a Mexican restaurant that wasn't that plain boiled shredded white meat.  This place serves chicken chunks crisped up on a griddle and lots of seasoning and a hint of lemon.  You can mix and match your tacos, and four tacos makes a big meal.  The burritos have the same meat choices.  Great tortillas again.  Another bonus is that the burros aren't massive- hear me out.  A burro is supposed to be hand-held food.  When it's so overstuff it splits apart or squirts out, you're making eating harded.   These are very well crafted-- good shape, size and ratio.  Not too much tortilla (I'm looking at you Azteca), not too much stuffing (Rito's).  Plus, the price is right you can just get two burros and still be out the door for $10.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating of gringos like myself.  Open late.  Alas, no breakfast burros.",

As we walked into the restaurant we were dubious to order but we've always known that hole in the walls tend to have the best food and this joint was no exception. I ordered the asada gordita and my husband the chorizo and asada tostada with a side of the mini chorizo quesadilla. Hands down this has been the best Mexican food we have eaten and even being from LA. The food was fresh made to order and did not taste of grease like other Mexican foods. Another upside was their affordable prices. The only downside is their small menu selection, but their tasty quality food makes up for it. If you are in town please give this modest hole in the wall a try! You will honestly not regret it!",
