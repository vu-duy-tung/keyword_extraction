My boyfriend got the lasagna and I got the special which was various fish including shrimp and calamari and some of the most wonderfully done crispy fresh vegetables.  Both of our meals were SMOKING HOT which I love!  The portions were a little smaller than we are accustomed to at Italian places so, next time, we will get an appetizer or salad.  It is wonderful discovering a great little restaurant so close to home and we will definitely be back.",

When I asked the manager if he was aware of the menu's shortcomings, he replied,  \"I make the menu, you don't like, you get out.  Go somewhere else\".  We surely will.  Very rude and disrespectful.  This manager/owner waltzes around schmoozing and telling stories of Italy, but if you dare to criticize, he becomes  very short-fused.",

    "text": "It's been a while since I've eaten at Veneto, but now that I live in Phoenix, I'm going to have to make this a go to for great Italian food!  The meal I had here was among the most memorable in my life!  We went here on the recommendation of the concierge at our hotel in Mesa.  When we arrived, we were a bit skeptical.  The restaurant is a bit unassuming, and considering it's tucked away in a strip mall (granted a very nice strip mall in Scottsdale), we had second thoughts.  As soon as we went inside, however, our concerns were soon allayed.  The dining room is absolutely lovely.  It is warm and inviting and very nicely done.  It makes for a reasonably romantic dining experience if you are looking for that, but it's also great for groups (and they have a great patio).  The decor is not obtrusive, and the atmosphere is very conducive to conversation.  The ambiance, plus great service, really makes Veneto a destination worth seeking from anywhere in the valley.  Of course, all the ambiance and service in the world means nothing without good food.  Fortunately, Veneto doesn't disappoint in the culinary department.  We started our meal with the Bruschetta al Salmone (bruschetta with salmon).  Bruschetta is one of my favorite appetizers (or snacks - basically a favorite all around), so it takes a lot to impress me when it comes to this dish.  Their take on this plate did not disappoint.  The flavors were bright and fresh, and the fish played nicely with the fresh tomatoes.  Absolutely wonderful bruschetta.  I was half tempted to order a second plate and just call it a meal.  Fortunately for me we avoided the temptation to eat nothing bruschetta and moved on to entrees.  I had swordfish (it was a special - not on their usual menu) and my girlfriend had the ravioli.  After being primed for a good meal by a mind blowing appetizer, we were hoping the entrees would live up to the opening act.  They did not disappoint.  I was a bit hesitant to get seafood at a restaurant in Phoenix.  Arizona is not exactly know to be a wet place, so fish in the desert seems risky.  However, considering the freshness of the salmon from our appetizer, I took the risk.  I'm glad I did.  The swordfish was, in all honesty, some of the best seafood I have ever had.  It was probably among the top five seafood dishes I have ever eaten.  Anywhere.  The fish was fresh, flakey, cooked just right, and seasoned in a way that brought out the natural goodness of the swordfish steak.  They didn't have to hide subpar fish under a wave of spices.  This was good fish, and they made it shine.  My girlfriend's pasta was also very good.  It was a nice blend of flavors, and the pasta was cooked to perfection.  For dessert, we had their take on tiramisu.  Once again I could have set myself up for disappointment because tiramisu is hands down my favorite dessert of all time, but once again, Veneto delivered.  The flavors were rich yet balanced, and the chocolate they topped it off with played nicely with the traditional mascarpone and espresso.  We also imbibed with some kind of boozy amaretto dessert coffee drink.  It, too, was delicious.  It was the prefect sweet ending to a very memorable meal.  Veneto is, quite simply, brilliant, and they provided me with one of my most memorable dining experiences ever.  I can't recommend this place enough.  Even before I moved here I was recommending it to my friends when they traveled to Phoenix.  It's a great meal in a great atmosphere, and honestly, it's a great value.  I would pay twice as much as I paid for my meal.  Seriously, try this place.  You will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "I was at a business meeting at a Starbucks in Scottsdale one afternoon and I smelled something wonderful. I couldn't keep my mind on the business deal because of the aroma of some very delicious food. Whatever they were saying was not even important. I could only think where was that food smell coming from? The meeting was finally over, no doubt rushed along by me, and I walked to a little eating place a couple of doors down. I peeked in, looked at the menu, then cancelled my plans that night and came to a place that would become a favorite. I still get a little tear when I remember my first ossobuco there.   Veneto Trattoria reminds me of the small, friendly little places that I have been to in Venice where the food and the ambiance combine together for a memorable experience. I have been there many times--alone, with family, with friends, with business associates--and each time has been wonderful.   Last night, It was a little cold outside so I had the gnocci to warm me up. The plump potato dumplings tasted homemade and the meat sauce was delicious. One of my buddies had my all time favorite Veneto Trattoria dish: ossobuco. She let me taste hers and, like always, it was to die for. The veal shank and the risotto make a perfect flavor combination. Others at the table had the sausages and the pork chops. Of course I mooched a taste of those, too. Mmmm... Don't forget to have their salad with walnuts and goat cheese. It's not on the menu, but they will make it for you if you ask.  Here's a tip: become a regular. I go to Scottsdale for business several times a year and Veneto Trattoria is always on my list. Whether you travel to Scottsdale or live there, you should go to this spot whenever you can. Once you've been there twice, they will treat you like family.",

So here's a bit recap:  Antipasto: Carpaccio Affumicato (Thinly sliced cured smoked beef with shaved parmesan cheese, arugula and drizzled with balsamic, topped with a ginger-cucumber pesto) -- liked everything of this dish but not so much of the ginger pesto, the ginger taste was a bit too strong to me...  Entree: Orecchiette Salsiccia e Broccolini (Pugliese pasta sauteed with sausages and rapini, in extra virgin olive oil, garlic and red pepperoncino, slightly spicy) -- This dish was presented nicely, colorful and very flavorful! Gnocchi di Patate alla Bolognese  (Homemade potato dumpling served with homemade meat sauce) -- Loved the tasty meat sauce, and the potato dumpling was definitely one of a kind.  Dessert: Chocolate Souffle with Vanilla Ice Cream -- rich chocolate cake paired with the delish vanilla ice cream, yummmmm, what a sweet ending.",

When the wife and I want to go out and have a great dinner and be taken awesome care of- it's a Veneto Night. We have been here dozens and dozens of times, they do a wine tasting series through the summer and we haven't missed one in the last 6 years! I can honestly say that in all of my visits here they have NEVER had an \"off\" night. The food is consistent, the service is the best and it is all at a completely reasonable price. Nevertheless, on to my most recent experience:   It was great! The wife and I went for dinner on our anniversary and while we love bringing our little one with us here, it was great being alone :)  We had the eggplant gratin (bomb!) and the pasta fagioli soup to start and followed those up with the gnocchi and linguini with red sauce and scallops, fish, mussels and shrimp and all I have to say is Damn! I love homemade pasta and I love it even more when it is smothered in all things good from the sea. The wife's gnocchi was great, this is the only place she will order it from. The brought us some tiramisu with a candle for our anniversary which was nice. All that plus a few glasses of wine and we didn't even hit $90.   I don't want to get into novel length here, but I cannot say enough about how great this place is. The owners are ALWAYS there, they never turn over the staff (always a good sign) and their food is consistently fantastic. I can't list everything that I have eaten here but it's a lot and it has all been good.... I even enjoyed the squid ink risotto :)  Anyway, please do yourself a favor and go here. Enjoy the people, enjoy the food and tell the world.... it's that good!",

I would give it five stars, but I'm saving a five star rating for a restaurant that lifts me off my feet.  Call me a prude.  Call me a romantic.  I don't care.  Let's start, and almost finish, with the food--it's terrific.  I've never had a bad, or mediocre, meal at this place.  I especially enjoy the gnocchi.  Sure, part of the reason I like the gnocchi is because I enjoy saying, \"gnocchi.\"  It's just fun to say.  It's good, clean fun for the whole family.  But, aside from the tantalizing vocalization of the dish, it's really tasty.  The other dishes are great as well, but I won't bore you with a detailed description of each item.  I'm verbose, but not selfish.  Well...maybe 'not selfish' should be replaced with 'lazy' but I think you understand.  The ambiance is decent even though it's in a strip mall.  However, we live in Phoenix, so you can't really knock a place for that.  They do have some nice outdoor seating.  The owner and staff are really friendly and will talk your ear off about Italy winning the world cup--even though it happened a year and a half ago.  In summation, this place is aces...but don't tell anyone, because, as other people have written, this is a hidden gem.",

But I'm Italian so i can judge and well the quality is actually very decent. Yesterday I had the linguine with seafood and they were just how I asked and al dente how they supposed to be. If you are on date this is a right place..pretty small...intimate ...kinda romantic also...you will look good if you bring her here and the wine list is actually very interesting and good selection.

The first time we were taken by friends and my pasta was inedible.  The sauce was blah and I was happy I ordered a half order of eggplant or I would have starved.  The eggplant was just so-so...    We gave it another try and after being ignored for 20 minutes while the waiter pawed some 20 something in the middle of the room, he took my sister's order and left the table without asking me for mine.  He needed to rush to the bar to kiss and maul another blonde.  I guess amore' made him amnesiac as well as rude, so after another 15 mins he sent a woman over to ask us what we had ordered, as Don Juan had forgotten our order and misplaced our slip.  The place was three quarters empty and I can see why.  My eggplant was rubbery and tasted like insoles.  My sister's proschutto was okay..how do you mess up pre-sliced ham and the salad was mediocre.    As if the food were not bad enough and the service disgraceful...the waitstaff have an 'attitude' as if you should be honored that they are speaking to you at all.   CHECK!!!!!  Exit stage right.",

After seeing all of the good reviews, I was really excited to try this place.  We walk in late Saturday evening a couple of weeks ago without a reservation (God forbid!) and get attitude from the hostess who looked me up and down right when we walked in.  \"Uhm, I think we will be able to get out you in. Do you want to sit outside?\"  Anyways, we got a small, cozy table in the corner which is my favorite!  Our server was fine, nothing to complain about, but he really didn't do anything to make an impression.  I ordered lasagna, and I was really pumped for it.  But then I almost spit out the first bite! It tasted like overcooked, processed Spaghetti-O's! The pasta wasn't right, the sauce was dreadful and watery, and the spices seemed like they were only trying to cover up the horrible attempt at lasagna.  Disgusting.  My boyfriend liked his entree, but we agreed we wouldn't want to go back.  If you go, MAKE A RESERVATION and do not get the lasagna.",

    "text": "Went to Veneto Trattoria last Sunday for dinner on the recommendation of the concierge at the Phoenician and I wasn't disappointed. The old go-to was Voce (which was originally LeccaBaffi when we used to frequent it), but it seemed like the quality had gone down over the last couple of visits there. As critical as it sounds, I really look for Italian places that actually do their own homemade pasta as a sign of a decent place.   The wife and I celebrated our 2nd wedding anniversary here for dinner and decided to go with a couple things to share. We started with the Pasta e Fasioi which was delicious as a soup starter to share. The wife went with the Fettuccine al sugo d'anitra which was homemade fettuccine with a braised duck sauce. The dish was good, but both of us agreed that it wasn't what we expected. The duck was diced up into cubes in the sauce and we both were thinking it would have been more like a fork tender slow cooked duck sauce. I opted for the Tagliatelle con Calamari which was superb. The noodles were made and prepared to perfection and cooked al dente. The Calamari was prepared perfectly and not hard and rubbery like most preparations. We opted to share an order of the osso bucco for a main dish (Wow, we sure did have bigger eyes than our stomachs). The Osso Bucco was excellent as well and extremely tender.   For dessert, the tiramisu was creamy and topped with both a chocolate and coffee/espresso sauce that took the dish to a whole new level. Top all of that off with excellent service and a complimentary piece of homemade tiramisu for our anniversary and we have a winner of a place to come back and visit again.",

Again, like most of my meals on this trip, it was dinner with a big group of coworkers. By far, the dish that got the most rave reviews was the special of the day a  Dover Sole that they boned and filleted for you at the table.  But.... I didn't order that and neither did the guy next to me.  I started with a house salad with a vinaigrette that was overwhelmed by the amount of vinegar in the dressing.  For an entree, I got veal parmigiana which was two smallish pounded out pieces of veal with good tomato sauce good mozzarella on top and some overcooked squash, zucchini and carrots on the side.  It was tasty but not much veal for the price paid.  The guy next to me got the Osso Bucco and judging by how he had to hack at it with a knife, far from the fall of the bone tender you expect from a braised dish.  Based on how happy the Dover Sole crowd was with what they ordered, I'd be willing to give it another go on a subsequent trip to Scottsdale but they would need to step it up all the way around to get a third visit.",

I ordered a Ziti con Melanzane and the penne was not al dente it was undercooked and very hard to chew with a tomato sauce that was bland and absolutely tasteless. My husband's minestrone soup looked very unappetizing it came in a very small ball and was tasteless too. His calamari pasta was average. All the dishes in this restaurant are over priced and way too expensive for what u get in return. I wouldn't go back there again, our first and last visit!!",

I never had to ask for more water, they saw it low and immediately came over to refill.  The bread was also great and they bring oil and vinegar and butter. The first time I went I started with their meatball appetizer. I highly suggest getting this (it is an Italian place but they do not believe I'm spaghetti and meatballs) then I had the sea bass as my mail course which was good but a bit dry. It came with some vegetables which were so good.  The second time I had the gnocchi with gorgonzola and walnuts except I asked them to add a bit of red sauce to it. That was SO DELICIOUS. I was so happy that they were so willing to change up their menu to accommodate my needs.   Parking: when I went there was a lot of parking all around (it is in a strip mall so there is a lot of parking)",

This place made me want to go to Italy! What a great place to eat and rest, especially after a long day of deals and sales!  -Decor: Homey bistro-style interior. -Food: Pasta was really really good. We got calamari pasta (Tagliatelle Con Calamari), ear pasta with sausage and rapini (Orecchiette Salsiccia E Broccolini), Cornish hen (Galletto Alla Rustica), prosciutto pasta (Tagliatelle Tiroles), lasagna, and pork chop. I only tried the pasta dishes, and they were all heavenly delicious. I still have dreams about the spicy tomato sauce in the calamari pasta and the olive oil sauce in the sausage rapini pasta.  -Service: very attentive. Got my glass of water no ice filled incessantly throughout the meal.  I don't think I want every day to be a Black Friday, but I want every day to be a good pasta day in Veneto. I've never been so impressed with pasta! Will be back.",

Keep in mind my love is a born and bred Eye-talian. She was (dramatic pause) very hyped on this anecdote.  Second clue: there were some ol' folks all over the joint speakin' in Italian, and I feel like when fools from the ol' country come out to patronize, it equates to realness.  The strip mall location threw me initially, but I'm still struggling to get a handle on the culture of Scottsdale. Food was fantastic, the mood was right, and the service was impeccable.  Notably (for this Yelper), the staff were able to carry on meaningful conversations that didn't invade our evening, but that also transcended the banal. Talkin' gluten-free and my man speakin' briefly about his autistic son and gluten-free experimentation was rad. It's this kind of thing that equates dining to an experience, not just a transaction.",

Friends and families all enjoying great food and one another.  This place has a warm vibe and amazingly fast service--truly. I've never seen servers and bushops move so fast through a restaurant!   Sadly, we didn't have pasta--we were going to come back and try that, but never made it. But by all the plates going by us, I can imagine it's delicious.   We each had a fish dish: I had the bass special, and my wife had the swordfish. She orders swordfish whenever she gets the chance, and she said that that was probably the best--or at least among the best--that she had ever had.   We also shared the most incredible dessert. While every item on the menu sounded creative and interesting, we settled on the semifreddo al pistacchio. Oh. My. Goodness. So so good.   The dining room is really lovely. Warm lighting. Tables snuggled together, but not too close. It's divided into two rooms, and the outside seating area is nice, too, even though it's next to a parking lot. This is a lovely place for a nice date night with your honey, or to enjoy with a small group of friends or family.   We did not have a reservation, and the host was very kind to seat us. But I don't recommend just showing up. Make a reservation.",

We returned again a few weeks later and decided to order linguini with clams and veal ravioli. The linguini was OK, nothing special. The sauce was a bit watery and the clams were slightly overcooked. If this was the only issue we probably would still want to return and try again. However, the raviolis were dreadful. The veal was mushed up inside like cat food and they were so salty we could barely swallow them. It was an extremely disappointing meal.

We tried veneto and were overall unimpressed especially considering the prices. We don't mind paying close to $20 for good pasta but we felt what we got was pretty bland and not very fresh or authentic tasting (we are italian). My husband had the orrichiette and I had the pasta with eggplant. My husband requested hot oil or peppers but the only had the dry pepper flakes available (blech). Our kids just had plain spaghetti in a tomato sauce (they charged us 13.95 for each).   Service was ok but ambiance was setting was really dated.  There was a stale odour when we walked in. Maybe it was the carpet. The place is in need of a major Reno. The dim lighting must be hiding more wear on tear in the restaurant. I would not recommend this place or return.",

We've hit this place several times in a few days. I could eat there very night.  The homemade pasta is out of this world.  The pasta with speck and light cream sauce has a smoky flavor that is so good.  We had the scallops special with roasted red pepper sauce.  I don't like scallops but I tried it and loved it.  We've had the pork osso bucco - again, fabulous!  The gnocci with bolognese meat sauce is light and fluffy in a rich, complex tomato sauce.  Try the smoked carpaccio, it is different than normal carpaccio and absolutely delicious.  You absolutely can not go wrong at this place with anything you order.   The wine list is good - you can't go wrong with the Vietti or any of the italian wines they carry.  The patio is lovely and the service is incredible.

(Prior to looking at this place stumbled upon an Italian restaurant it looks like almost every single patron were of senior citizens, and the place is packed). That's when we decided to leave and come over here. This restaurant is perched in the plaza next to a Starbucks. This restaurant features a nice outside patio to dine at as well as the inside of the restaurant.  Unfortunately I was not able to take any pictures of the food that I ate because my phone died. We started off with some starter bread and butter and then the server came over and told us the specials of the day. Ordered the spaghetti alle Vongole with white sauce. Aka with clams. Also order the special of the day which is the pasta with seafood in a marinara sauce. Both dishes topped with grated Parmesan cheese!   The pasta tasted delicious and cooked al dente but some of the clams had some bits of sand or broken shells of some sort that I kept biting into and just was not as great of an experience. The other seafood dish filled with scallops, shrimp and topped with 2 huge mussels was also good except the mussels tasted too fishy and old. The server told us that the mussels came from the Mediterranean - which we are not sure how the shipping process was to get all the way here.   The brims of our water glasses were always filled to the top which to me is always fantastic and shows good service!",

    "text": "Many years ago my husband and I \"stumbled \" on Veneto Trattoria and loved it. We returned often when in Scottsdale, but have not been in a few years.  While the restaurant has significantly expanded since our last visit, and was very busy,  the food was not as good as I remember.  Cod special was very tasty and cooked well, sauteed vegetables very good and well done, mashed potatoes were too salty and tasted more like box then home made.  Arugula salad special, was tasty but for a dinner portion salad at $10.95 overpriced.   Especially, when ordered with entree    Service left a lot to be desired.  Other than taking my order, my waitress was too busy chatting in Italian with a group of ladies celebrating a birthday.  She never returned to ask if I needed anything, my food was brought to me by support staff, dessert menu brought by the manager.    Not sure if I will return, as there are so many other great choices in this city.",

Loved the prosciutto but the mozzarella was phenomenal.  The experience was cool because Venetos is unpretentious.  It leaves you asking or wanting for nothing additional. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

    "text": "My book club met here for lunch to talk about our latest book set in Italy and the initial impression was it was a fabulous choice. I loved the decor, the atmosphere and looking at the menu, I had the impression that the food would be delicious.   The bread was certainly delicious although it was served with butter and not olive oil. Regardless, the bread was still mouth watering. Especially the one with the sage & thyme flavor.   I think my friends enjoyed what they ordered- all the dishes looked delicious when the food came. All of them remarked how much they liked their house salads- esp. the tangy red wine vinegar salad dressing.   I had ordered the pork sausage on Savoy cabbage with polentas. When the dish came, the presentation looked great. 3 pieces of beautifully grilled polentas, 2 pork sausage links on a bed of Savoy cabbage. That is, until I took a bite of the dish!    It was soooooo salty that I felt like I was eating a salt lick!  I could feel my eyes bulge out it was so, so, so very salty.   I thought to myself: \"wow, if I was a deer, I would be super happy just about now cause I felt like I had opened up a jar of salt and was pouring it into my mouth!!!    There might have been flavor to the dish but I couldn't taste anything but the salt cause . . . . It was soooo salty!!!  When I mentioned it to the waiter, he did not offer to take back the dish or offer compensation. He merely shrugged his shoulders.   One of my friends remarked how snubby he seemed which was a disappointment to me since I usually receive good service.   Another friend told me I should not have to pay for the meal if it was that bad. I still paid. Right now, 6 hours later even after 2 hours of playing tennis, my mouth still feels completely salty. You know the feeling.   So if you have high blood pressure or diabetes you should not order the pork sausage dish. If you are a deer in human disguise looking for a salt lick then by all means go for it!!!",

We were seated in the bar area with the front door propped open. I went to the ladies room and noticed the dining portion of the restaurant was much warmer. After looking around and noticing the restaurant was empty,I asked our server to be seated in the dining area. She gladly took us over there. A few minutes later she told us the owner will not allow us to sit in the dining area if we are only having coffee and dessert. Now mind you it's not dinner time and there was one other table occupied. I am not unreasonable and if it were the dinner rush hour I would have been compliant with the request. I felt at this point it was extremely rude and has lost our business today and in the future. I feel that all patrons count regardless of the total bill. The server was embarrassed and apologetic. This falls on the owner.",

The owner came to my table and began to lecture me on how Veal can't be cooked between the 2 versions that I had been given! In fact the owner was rude, disrespectful, and angry.  He told me that I had no right to send back 2 steaks and that I should leave!    My friend and I completely shocked and speechless stood up and walked out.  I have been to this place a handful of times in the past and always had adequate experiences, but to be treated this way as a customer is disgusting and there is no excuse for this poor behavior.  What I will share with you is this restaurant caters to an older demographic of guests.  There are many regulars who visit this establishment, who are used to average food, below par service, and most likely don't know any better to distinguish from very average to a truly worthwhile dining experience.  The owner waltzes around bragging and telling stories of his past and of Italy... Some people may want to be in this kind of environment, however do not plan on going here if you want privacy as this place is very small and lacks the kind of romantic italian ambiance that one who hope for.    If you are looking for really good food save your time and money.  The food is average at best!  The prices are not some great value either.  The average entree price is just about $18, and apps/salads are each about $9 on avg.  Truthfully there are better places to eat in the valley and there should never an instance where a customer is treated so poorly by an owner.    Close your eyes and imagine seared rear meat-- I have had seared tuna sashimi that was more cooked than the steak that was brought to me.  This is inexcusable and poor execution.  Makes me wonder who they have working in their kitchen.  Pretty disappointing. Epic Fail!",

The food is prepared and presented well with dishes inspired from Northern Italy. They often have interesting specials each evening. Dress is usually business casual. Appetizers and dinner salads are very good. Some of my favorite entrees are osso buco, clams with linguine, and house prepared ravioli. Desserts are very good but a bit on the small side. My only complaint is that inside seating can become very noisy.  Because of this, I usually prefer to sit outside on their front patio with a gas heater lamp as necessary.",

The third best is Trattoria Veneto.  Order their pasta bolognese and you'll discover the subtlety of how real Italians prepare this dish.  They also do an excellent job of veal scallopini with porcini mushrooms.  The atmosphere is nice but not special or memorable.  We love the Italian lady who waits on us and Michele the owner from Treviso.  What I appreciate about this restaurant, Andreoli  and Pomo is that they haven't changed their cuisine to suit the American palette.  You get real Italian food at these three.",

    "text": "We were in town for Giants Spring Training and decided to eat here after reading the other yelpers' reviews.  We made same-day reservations and I gotta say, I was really looking forward to it.  We were seated immediately inside with a few other diners scattered around.  Our waiter, Pino greeted us with a friendly accent and brought our selected bottle of wine.  After a few minutes, we decided to split a mescalun and goat cheese salad and ordered our entrees - he: seafood liguine and me: spinach & ricotta ravioli, both in a light tomato sauce.  The salad arrives, it was good.  The goat cheese was soft & creamy and a nice touch.  Other diners arrive, more wine pouring by Pino, the clock is ticking and no entrees.  Our bottle is almost empty, others who arrived after us are now on their dessert and still we have no entrees.  After 40 minutes I asked Pino how much longer.  He says (holding up 3 fingers) \"Three more minutes.\"  Uh-huh.  Ten minutes go by, I ask again.  He says \"The seafood has to be cooked special. The sauce takes time.  If you wanted it sooner you should have told me when you placed your order to put it in right away.\"  What??? They were simple seafood pasta and ravioli dishes.  And I wanted my wine WITH my dinner, not as its own course.  If he was in the business as long as he said he was (20 years) he should know to feed diners the food and not BS.  Finally after an hour, we get our entrees.  Unfortunately, they were nothing special.  The raviolis were too al dente, mostly pasta with a small amount of filling and swimming in sauce.  His seafood linguine was decent, but no big deal.   The fastest thing in the restaurant are the busboys.  I swear it was like they were on roller skates.  Pino could learn a few things from those guys but I doubt his ego would permit it.",

Over a decade, Roberto and his team offered a broad menu with daily specials that consistently were high quality in a desert environment where shellfish and raw food items are both risky and expensive.  It was the ONLY Italian restaurant I visited who did not overcook the pasta, and had enough sense to offer 3 specials at lunch and 5 at dinner, a smart move for any restaurant that wants to maintain a steady clientele.",

Server Wanda recommended the Pinot Bianco wine special on 1/2 price and it was superb!  We started with the salmon bruschetta and it was sublime.  I had the lasagna and my wife went for the whole wheat pasta caprese with tomatoes and mozzarella of course, and both were served with delicious Italian bread and butter.  This is the place to get your northern Italian on in Scottsdale!  Dining room full by the time we left so reservations recommended unless you go early like we did.",

I did find it odd that this place didn't seem to have an official hostess stand so we were a little confused about who to ask for a table initially.  We were finally seated and the food was in fact pretty good. I had the orecchiette which didn't look amazing but tasted delicious. My boyfriend had some sort of shrimp stuffed pasta which he thought was just ok.   Overall, I'd say 3.5 stars. Prices were a little steep for the strip mall location and the food quality varied.   Side note: Since it was a strip mall I let my boyfriend just wear shorts and a Giants shirt. He ended up being underdressed -- but maybe thats because the old folks like to dress up?",

    "text": "I come here off and on. Well OK, to be honest this is my \"Cheers\" where I usually go and sit at the bar and enjoy outstanding wine, appetizers ( the BEST burrata) and great company. But tonight I came by, my bar seats were taken, so I sat at a table. The special tonight was a new beef dish made with a grass fed beef from a special breed of cows from the Piedmont area in Italy. The backstory here is that I usually prefer to eat a more Paleo oriented diet where livestock graze, fish are caught wild in the ocean, vegetables are growing in my organic garden, or I'm foraging food from the field.  Mind you, I get that most of the food I eat at my favorite Italian restaurant is not that. But I trust that the love that's put into the cooking in the wonderful olive oils used make it a blessing to my digestive tract. NOW, I have a new meal I can order here that fits my most preferred dietary formulas! This grass fed beef was amazingly tender and tasty. Cooked to perfection, flavor leaning on its own deliciousness, served with exactly the right combination of arugula salad and hard cheeses. Hoping they find a good source for wild caught salmon eventually... I will be even more devoted.  Please come and try it!",

    "text": "That moment when you sit down in a lovely little restaurant and realize that you've struck Italian food GOLD...  We stopped by after one of our 2 hour walks one afternoon. First, the restaurant is beautifully appointed. It felt like stepping into a family restaurant in Italy. The menu had wonderful selections and being the first time we found several options that made a single selection difficult.   The waiter was wonderful, very helpful and made useful suggestions including the day's specials. My wife immediately decided on the special and I tried a spinach pasta with a light mushroom and ham cream sauce.   Delicious, light, and absolutely enjoyable meal.   Proud that we managed to avoid licking the plates, we were still compelled to order a meal to go. We know we will return soon and embark on a determined mission of conquest over the rest of the menu. Go soon, relax and enjoy a visit to Italy without the 12 hour flight.",

We started with a house salad (perfect size to share), and I have to say the white vinegar aftertaste worked magic. Lasagna was good, but not the best (maybe a little more besciamella next time), orecchiette with sausage and rapini was AMAZING!! Al dente, sauce not too heavy, we both loved it. Our waiter, Lauren, took great care of us. We'll be back for more pasta and wine!!",

We like it a lot and recommend it to others.  When we met friends for dinner recently, we discussed alternatives and i swayed the group toward this normally fine restaurant.   We were seated immediately.  The restaurant was very busy but there seemed to be plenty of staff.  I should have gotten nervous when after greeting us, our waitress took more than 15 minutes to return.  We saw her infrequently.  Food and beverages were generally delivered by others though she took the order.  I ordered squid ink pasta with calamari.  It is a dish I love and often order when I see it. I hadn't seen it on this restaurant's menu before. I also ordered a salad.  The salad was not good which might be blamed on the romaine crisis that week.  The pasta was unlike any squid ink pasta I had seen before, in the US or Italy. It was light pasta with streaks of black.  The calamari was difficult to eat.  I know it is often tough but I had difficulty piercing pieces with a fork.  My wife ordered ravioli and it was barely warm when she got it but it tasted good.  Why didn't we complain?  Our food was delivered by others and we didn't see our waitress for quite a while.  We will return when in town.  I hope this was a one time problem caused by the stress of a full house.  Next time the restaurant is really busy, I think I will have to make a decision about staying or going elsewhere.  Up to now, our experiences have been great when dining here.",

Sometimes Italian place have a \"white\" or \"red\" sauce that goes on everything - not here! Each of our dishes had a special sauce that was unique and superb!

Upon original contact the staff was friendly but not very attentive for as slow as it was. My iced tea glass sat empty(in plain view on the end of the table)  for half the meal and at least  15 minutes after We all were finished, and the table was cleared, so I am a little dumbfounded by all the attentive service comments.  That said, let's talk about the food. The bread they brought before the meal was very good but the basket sat empty after our entrees were delivered. I ordered lasagna and my friend had a pasta seafood which smelled. And looked good, but the lasagna was a different story, I would say it was good, not great, fantastic or outstanding...in my opinion, the lasagna at Casella's Deli (which is just about 2 miles away) is much better (and in my opinion the service was 100 times better).    To sum it up, I was not impressed, in my opinion, there are better places, but it was not awful and it was not 5star either. I guess it depends on your personal preferences.",

Thankfully this place ended up being very memorable for the food and the service.   I never order seafood soups but the way the server described this special appetizer, it sounded great so I got it and it was AMAZING! It had one clam, one mussel, one scallop (good size), one piece of halibut, and one piece of salmon (it also came with one piece of shrimp but I eliminated it because I am allergic) and it was in a light red broth. It may have been the best soup I've ever had.  For the entree I got the lasagna, my special lady got whole wheat pasta with mozzarella and tomato in an amazing tomato sauce called a 'Capris Pasta' or something similar. My son got a basic spaghetti that turned out to be not so basic because the sauce was simply incredible.   We went in not expecting much at all, 8:45pm, somewhat last minute with little planning and this turned out to be one of the best meals on our trip.   Beyond that, the service was perfect. The staff were absolute professionals in every sense of the word.   I highly recommend Veneto Trattoria.",

A busy non-tourist spot is always a good sign that we picked a great place, and we were not disappointed.  My wife had a basic lasagna bolognese, a good bellwether dish and she could not have been more impressed.  I opted for one of the specials of the night, a beef filet with a cremini mushroom cream sauce over polenta.  The filet was cooked perfectly, the sauce was light, and the polenta creamy and delicious.  The service from our waiter was spot on, and a bottle of 2010 Michael Chiarello Barolo was a perfect match for the meal.  They have a relatively short, but complete wine list, so we had no problem picking a great wine.  We finished our meal with a coffee drink and cognac...a terrific end to a wonderful dinner.  The next time we are in Scottsdale, we will most certainly visit again!",

We started with the Insalata d'arugula e radicchio and the Carpaccio Affumicato.  The salad had almonds and great parmesan and we were taken with the smokey flavor of the beef.   The atmosphere called for pasta so we each picked one.  Peg had the Fettuccine  with duck ragout and I had the Veal and Mushroom Ravioli.  We shared of course and both of us loved both of them.

Some of our other favorites are the Brick Chicken, which is sometimes a special and the filet.  Our favorite server, Silvana, is the best!  She is one of the reasons we come back to this restaurant.    Everything on the menu is good.  The owner, while pleasant, seems to only be friendly with customers he has known for years.  He also needs to engage with new customers.",

Tasted like a stale piece of angel food cake. We complained to the waiter and he removed the plate. When the bill came the charge for the tiramisu was included. I asked the waiter why this was so and he said the owner did not offer refunds. I asked to speak to the owner and he came over and was clearly combative. I asked why he would charge a customer for a dish that was returned. He said there was nothing he would do. I said he was not a very good businessman who would risk losing a customer who was paying $90 for dinner over a $8.50 desert. His answer was \"I don't care\".",

The biggest compliment I can give them is that they completely changed my Ciopino game. I've only had a heavier more tomato based version and there's is so much better. They are extremely generous with the seafood and it is excellent quality. The shrimp is whole and head on like it is everywhere in Europe. Highly recommended.",

I ordered a glass of red Italian wine, but I can't remember the name. $10.00 a glass and it was good.   For dinner I ordered gnocchi with cream sauce and walnuts. I requested the wait staff add in some chicken, but she said she couldn't do that. For that alone they get one star reduction. They don't seem to be flexible with their clients and that's unacceptable.  Fresh bread was provided. No oil for dipping. There was a bit of garlic butter though.   Dessert was ice cream with scotch, cappuccino, chocolate chips, and whipped cream. Very good.   Water glass was mostly full all the time.  Service was so so. The guy filling my water glass was the friendliest help there.   They need to work harder for my service.",

I ordered the Veal Scallopini and my husband the Seafood dish.  They were both excellent!  I have to give credit to our waitress as well.  Because of the rain, they had to move  some tables in from outside.  Our waitress was attentive and efficient with all the confusion in the cramped space.  Such a great Italian restaurant!

We have traveled to Italy many times, and the food is definitely on par (if not better) than several authentic Italian eatery.

It did take quite a looong time to get our drinks, and a much looonnnger time to have our orders taken.   Good thing we all had things to talk about!  I ordered one of the specials of the evening:   linguine with shrimp in lemon cream sauce.   It was quite tasty albeit I wouldn't mind if the pasta could be cooked a bit less so it doesn't stick together.  Just my taste preference, I guess.   It was plenty creamy -- I did have added grated cheese, though, since I like cheese -- and the shrimp was cooked to perfection.     The people I talked to said their food was good.   I didn't try any of it, and it was too noisy to carry on a conversation let alone ask what they all thought of their food.  I will give the food four stars but the wait time would have kicked it back to three.   If I go again, and the wait time is still very looonnng, I will give it three and probably not return.   I'm not kidding.  It was soooo long that we were all watching for the server to make sure we could snag her before she could disappear into the unknown.",

We asked her to clarify how she would like us to do that she let us know at the end of the meal we should just let her know how much we wanted on each card. The food came out in an ok amount of time. The food okay. The check came we proceeded to pay it the way she told us to. She randomly picked a check to charge the entire tip. She over charged my card.

You should order this when you go, because its sooooo good. I had the Filetto Al Porcini...it was a special...phenominal. In my family we believe in sharing when it comes to food, so I also tried the Sole, Sea Bass, and Arribiata. Delish. It was pretty busy in the restaurant, but the staff didn't seem to break a sweat. The servers/managers that know my parents even made time to come over and hang out for a bit. The owner and much of the staff are from italy, so you know its the real deal.

I ordered the spaghetti with white clam sauce, my wife ordered the seafood ravioli.  She had a salad, I had the special appetizer, which was prosciutto with mozzarella (forgive my spelling).  The salad and prosciutto were very good, but not the best.  Then the entree's came out.  My wife's seafood ravioli was supposed to be filled with shrimp and crab meat, but definitely had a fishy aftertaste to it which I would never associate with either of those two shellfish.  We would give that a C.  But what was placed before me was ziti with grilled chicken.  The waitress handled the error with aplomb and the right amount of \"trying to make it right\".  I tasted the dish, and I have to say I give it a B+, and didn't want to wait for them to prepare what I had actually ordered.  The espresso and capuccino were both very good.",

    "text": "Went to this restaurant based on Yelp reviews...was very disappointed.  First, the restaurant is located in a strip mall so it lacked a great deal in ambiance.  Second, for the prices of the menu items, I expected the food to be much more flavorful.  I believe their number one ingredient is butter since that's what everything tasted like.  I would not recommend this restaurant and will not be returning.",

    "text": "Yes, finally!!! This is an Italian restaurant worth going to in Scottsdale. You will definitely get what you paid for and more. We had a fantastic experience here last Thursday. The food was phenomenal, and this restaurant deserves many kudos. First, the ambiance was great. We ate outside and I must say it is a gorgeous patio. The inside looked pretty too but it was too good of a night to waste indoors. I had a real nice chardonnay to go with a stellar meal. I forgot the name of it but I loved it. All of us had a special, my dad had a halibut which was cooked in a special type of paper, I had homemade linguine with sun dried tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, shrimp in a light lemon and garlic sauce, my husband had chicken milanese, and my dad's lady friend had veal marsala. It was out of this world. OOh I cannot forget the appetizers.....We had proscuitto with fresh mozzarella, and we had portabella mushroom salad with a balsamic reduction. To top the night off we had tiramisu which was delightful. Thanks to all the Yelpers out there with their reviews, this truly was a great evening out.",

    "text": "Initially we were pleased by the atmosphere and the friendly demeanor of the hostess. Our server on the other hand seemed more interested in her cell phone than getting around to us. When she did manage to take our order she seemed annoyed to be inconvenienced by our presence. Our food took almost forty minutes to arrive and wait for it.... You guessed it, both orders were incorrect. When we got our servers attention her exact words were \" that's what you ordered\". At this point we laughed and agreed with her just to salvage the evening. Unfortunately, the pasta was severely over cooked, the marasala sauce had a sickeningly sweet after taste. My wifes plate had dried egg plant (?) on the side and what seemed to be dried milk at the bottom of her water glass. At this point the evening was ruined calmy I requested to speak with a manager. I was told the manager was unavailale. I then asked to speak with the person currently in charge a pimple faced kid came over looking like he was being chased by Argentinian gun runners he looked scared. When I once again, calmly explained my grievance his face dropped he mumbled something and dissapeared. Two minutes later our server came back with our credit card slip and a gift certificate for $10. $60 botched meal, health code issues galore and a total lack of interest in customer service. Review posting priceless.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite restaurants for many reasons! The service is fantastic- Roberto, the owner, and his wife Susan are often at the restaurant, greeting guests and going table to table. Reservations are recommended (especially if you are going on a Fri or Sat night in season), if you call ahead ask for Wanda. She is friendly and attentive, as is all the staff. The prices are very reasonable- you will get a meal on par with Mastro's or Flemings for half the price. You can't go wrong with their fresh pastas or seafood, homemade garlic sausages and wonderful desserts (love the semifredo!). They have consistently served fantastic food for the years my hubby and I have been going. The wine list is extensive, you'll be sure to find a favorite that won't break the bank, and don't forget to end your meal with an espresso or limencello. The atmosphere is great- relaxing, intimate, a place where you can talk with and enjoy the people with you. Also, don't miss the monthly wine dinners in summer- they serve new dishes that aren't on the menu and are very generous with the pours.",

We loved the authentic Italian atmosphere, and really liked that you can eat indoors or outside on a terrace. The service was outstanding - we had a friendly and attentive waiter from Italy. We ordered the Melanzane Pomodoro e Mozzarella (eggplant, mozzarella, and a red sauce) which was AMAZING, an appetizer salad, and for dinner, the Agnolotti ai Gamberi (shrimp ravioli) and a special for the night, linguini with seafood. There was plenty of seafood (scallops, white fish, shrimp, and mussels) and the sauce was amazing. Everything was fantastic. The food tasted great, the pasta was fresh and light, and the wait staff was fast and friendly. I even had room for the Tiramisu dessert, which was chocolate heaven. We finally found a place to satisfy our Italian cravings. We will definitely visit Veneto Trattoria again, and soon!!",

Our waitress was from Italy and was very knowledgeable and helpful.  We split a house salad that was very good and for our main course I had a seafood pasta that was similar to a ravioli.  Very tasty--only complaint was that it was a little cold, otherwise very good.  My wife had an oustanding seafood risotto that I felt was the best of the dishes that the 4 of us ordered.  It was really good with plenty of seafood and flavor.  Our friends had the same dish I had and a boned cornish hen over a soft polenta.  We shared a bottle of an Italian wine recommended by the waitress that was a red blended wine.  I forget the actual blend but it was very good.  We shared a chocolate souffle with some ice cream that was really good.  This place was between a 4 and a 5",

    "text": "You can't ask Veneto Trattoria \"where have you been all my life?\" because they have been exactly where they are for over 20 years, apparently serving tasty Italian food all the while.  At least they are now.  Veneto is a smallish old-fashioned place with comfortable seating and attentive service.  The food in basically Italian with a  Venetian twist at times, and what they do, they do very well.  You will not find some of the staple Americanized Italian dishes here -- there is only one veal dish, no eggplant parmesan, and not every pasta sauce is based on tomatoes.  But the menu has a couple of dozen choices with a wide variety of ingredients and preparations.  Be sure to ask about the off menu specials as well, as they seem to be more \"special\" than at most restaurants.  Everything we tried was tasty and well prepared with imaginative little touches and satisfying but not over-the-top flavors.  Try the Pistachio Semifreddo for dessert; I thought it was especially delicious.  Prices are reasonable too, although I wouldn't call Veneto \"cheap\".  Here is a place where you can go for a special occasion, and you can also use as a regular night favorite.",

The menu: Italian (no melted cheese over pasta here- this is th real deal). We had Venetian classics, like spaghetti alla vongole, pasta with squid ink. Great wine list, end it all with a tiramisu and a cafe corretto, and the only thing that makes feel disappointed is leaving the Northern Italian atmosphere to go back into the 105 degree heat.",

    "text": "\"To eat is a necessity, but to eat intelligently is an art\" Francois de la Rochefoucald  Desinare is the word for meal in Italian, and is also the verb to eat. The word is similar to the Latin word designare, which is to design or designate. Which can only mean that a real meal is one that is designed with thought.  No Truer words could be said to describe this gem of a find in Scottsdale.  It's about as authentic as Italian Cuisine can get from the Venetian region of Italy, hence the \"Veneto\" in this restaurant's name.  I am always in search of great Italian foods from the various regions of Italy, and my Italian friends have always sworn by this place as being quite authentic. Who am I to argue?  I am neither Italian, nor have I spent any part of my life living there. Although, I have visited parts of Italy, including Venice, a few times.  During the latter part of each year, we connect with old friends whom we haven't seen in awhile. We wanted to take them to a wonderful restaurant that serves great food, and has exemplary service. This was our choice this time around. There is nothing fancy about this establishment's exterior. However, from the moment you are greeted, to the time that the waitress bids you Ciao; this restaurant exudes an old world hospitality and elegance that is hard to match.  As you can see from the pics of our menu selection, we tried several of their varied offerings. We had the Pork Tenderloin, the Roasted Chicken, the Linguini, and I had that evening's special, which was the Swordfish.   Each of our dishes were masterfully executed. I was especially impressed with the grilled Swordfish's sauce, as this particular fish can be quite bland. It was definitely enlivened by the richness of the sauce.  After having been thoroughly satiated by our meals, we could only muster shared (instead of individual) desserts. My wife and I shared the Chocolate Hazelnut. Our friends shared Creme Brulee. They were \"buonissimo!\"  From the atmosphere, to the food's presentation, to the delicious care taken in preparing and seasoning the food, it's clear that a meal is True art here at Veneto Trattoria.",

It's a bit unique with some different offerings from other Italian Restaurants.  They start you off with some breads and butter. We had to ask for the oil and balsamic but those are given to regulars we noticed.  A HARD TO COME BY DISH that Veneto Trattoria offers is the Venetian Style Cod Appetizer. I haven't noticed this dish at any other Italian Restaurant in Metro Phoenix. It is Cod Mousse over Grilled Polenta Planks. I can you that the mousse was creamy and smooth. Also the polenta had a good taste from grill marks.  My main was a sauteed mixed fish salad. The price seemed very reasonable for what I got. It was very natural and only slightly seasoned.  My husband had the Orecchiette Pasta with Rapini, Sausages and Pepperoncino. He eats this kind of dish a lot but this was the mildest version of it he ever had.  Our server was nice enough.  The food might run a little more delicate in flavors from other Italian Restaurants....",

    "text": "Went there last evening.  It was very busy.  Our waiter was attentive BUT when I purchase a bottle of wine in an expensive restaurant I DONT LIKE TO POUR IT MYSELF.  The veal Milanese was excellent BUT my side didn't come out until my main course was almost complete.  I had to mention it to the owner's wife and the waiter.  I'll go back because the food is consistent, the other food at the table was fine.    Concerning the seating, it needs to be re-done, Its old and tired. The restaurant is classic authentic Italian and been around Scottsdale and is a go-to place.  NOTE:  I remember the owner when he worked at the famous Danielle in Venice many years ago, a classic 5-star hotel with a great rooftop restaurant AND WOW a great breakfast venue on the Grand Canal.",

Pastas are home made but so is  everything else! When the bread is good the food is going to be too! I've always found that bad bread, bad food. Good Bread  good food & add the meatballs in San Marzano tomato sauce, topped with grated ricotta!  Prego!    I recommend : Gnocchi di Patate al Gorgonzola e Noci Is sinful!  I made a mistake by offering to share Brodetto di Pesce alla Veneta the Cioppino fish stew with scampi, scallops, mussels, clams, calarari and seabass in a tomato-fishbroth  I wanted it all to my self!   The salmon was wild caught not farm and the tagiasca sauce with olive oil was perfection.  For a True treat,  order the Affogato ....my go to dessert.  A shot of espresso flavored with scotch, over vanilla ice cream and white chocolate chips, topped with whipped cream   Enjoy Ciao  Tina Hillstrom",

Service has been stellar and I love the \"neighborhood Italian restaurant\" vibe, but I have trouble finding things I want to order.  While what I have eaten is fine, this is just not my vote for where to go for Italian dinner.  However--I will mostly attribute this to the fact that I definitely prefer Southern Italian fare.  My dinner companions who like Northern have been much more impressed than I.   So to be fair, while I would give 3 stars, my companions would give 5 stars, my rating will be 4 stars with the advice that you review the menu in advance to be sure that the Northern recipes are what you expect.",

Everything is always delicious, fresh, and the flavors are awesome. We've experienced some slow service there but we just always make sure to have plenty of time for meandering the evenings we go here. They're always friendly to our young son, which is nice. Drinks are always made well and we enjoy the wine we've tried. Their recent lemon shrimp pasta was out of this world, as was the chocolate lava cake and the crema cotta. We also love the herb bread.   They help accommodate bigger parties too, which is a plus.",

    "text": "I felt like having Italian and I had been to Veneto Trattoria twice before with my husband a few years ago (once dining inside and the other outside).  Both times were wonderful.  Well, this time it was just me, my husband wasn't able to come.  I called the restaurant because it was a Friday evening and thought it might be busy.  Sue, who I now know is the Owner picked up the phone.  She had said they were very full and it was a busy night.  I told her it would be just me dining.  She said there is one open seat at the bar if that was okay and she would hold it for me.  I arrived about 15 minutes later and she said \"Amy, your seat is has been reserved right over there at the bar\".  Well, there was a cute little reserved sign and the place settting all set.  I felt like a VIP.  The Bartender, his name is Felix was so busy, I've never seen someone move so much noticedI me and said \"Oh, Amy?  I said yes. and he said great, we've been waiting for you\".  It was like coming home from a long vacation.  I was treated so wonderfully and my meal (the lasagna) was so fabulous not to mention their bread (italian thick sliced plus focaccia pieces served with whipped butter) was awesome.  I love bread.  Felix put a few extra focaccia pieces in my doggie bag since I couldn't finish all my lasagna.  They make their own Lemoncello so I had their version of a lemon drop martini with salt on half the rim.  It was one of the best I've ever had.  When, I got up to go, one of the other servers (who was not responsible for me at all) said to me \"thank you for coming\".  I can't express how well run and how welcoming this restaurant is.  The Staff is phenomenal.  I made it a point to tell Sue, the Owner my feelings and she smiled with pride.  It's nice for an owner of a business to hear good things rather than the usual complaints.  Too bad not enough people stop to pay a compliement rather than offer a criticism.",

The appetizers ware also great and described adequately in the menu and everyone (except my uncle, who ordered the lasagna and wasn't impressed) was so happy by the end of the meal, that we all indulged in either a specialty dessert coffee or the excellent dessert special (Chocolate Soufle with vanilla ice cream which was flawless and had a great presentation.

    "text": "Lasagna entree - $15 Bottle of meritage - $32 Tiramasu - $6 Smelling cigar smoke, hearing a car alarm, and listening to somebody with whooping cough - Priceless  Where's the half-star when you really need it?! Veneto is stuck in the middle, between 3 and 4. So, do I round up or round down? Such a tough decision. I can't rate this 5 like other people, for I did not think the food was 5-star worthy. However, based on other factors, the rating of this place deserves more than 3 stars... yet doesn't quite reach 4. Allow me to explain.   Atmosphere is 2-star worthy. Sure, sitting on their patio, tucked in the corner, makes for an intimate time with your date. Unless, of course, a car alarm goes off or you have to deal with a person coughing one of those rib-rattling coughs. You know the kind. Not to mention, people standing outside the \"Veneto patio perimeter\" to talk loudly on their cell phones. However, inside the patio, patrons were respectable. The occasional loud, inebriated table does not a bad experience make.   Price deserves 5 stars. With two entrees and a fantastic dessert, price came to $45. That's pretty great for two people. Throw in a bottle of wine, though, and you're looking at an $80 tab, before tip, which means you're really looking at a $100 tab (atleast), for service definitely deserves a generous gratutity!  Service definitely deserves 5 stars. Our waiter was top-notch. Very conversational, friendly, professional and attentive. He recommended a bottle of wine that would suit both a meat-focused entree (lasagna), as well as a fish dish. The wine - lyreth meritage from Sonoma - was smooth, silky and a perfect dance partner to both our dishes.   Dessert deserves 4 stars. Never before had my date seen Tiramasu served with two sauces on top. It's almost like the piece itself was divided into two tiny countries. One sauce was chocolate. The other was espresso-based. I could have just had spoonfuls of the latter and been quite content. However, the tiramasu was heavenly.   Decor deserves a 3, I think. Especially since the music they played didn't match the intimate and unique dining experience they offer here. It was too pop-ish and loud, even from sitting outside. When my date and I excused ourselves to the lavatories, we noticed semi-guady decor, high-back booths, rich creams and rubies throwing themselves against the walls. It wasn't a stomach-turning touch. Just a bit over done. A simple, clean layout would have done wonders for this place. Not to mention maybe a more subtle bar - without a blaringly bright TV set.   Food deserves 3 stars. It doesn't deserve any more than that. At least not the entrees we had. My date had the special, which came with mussels, crab meat, salmon, etc. in a pasta bowl with a damn fine light and flavorful sauce. I ordered the lasagna, which was a generous portion. Upon first bite, I couldn't place the taste. I had had it before! Given some time, I realized why I felt like this lasagna could be a new comfort food. It reminded me of when I was 8 and my mom would make me Chef Boyardee ravioli. The meat sauce of this lasagna tasted just like the ravioli sauce I used to love as a child. But, let's face it, I didn't go to Veneto to satisfy my 8-year-old self. I came to impress my adult self and enjoy a lovely night out with a wonderful man. My date even said later that it did, in fact, taste like the canned ravioli. He just didn't want to say anything at dinner for concern of insulting me or the lasagna. (Poor lasagna...)  Having eaten at Veneto this past weekend, I sit here and reflect upon the place. While there, I definitely thought this was a 4 star place. Now, however, I can't convince myself that I would ever go back. And I reserve 4 and 5 stars for places that hook me, that become places I crave, places I want to experience again and again... as well as places that leave a lasting impression. To me, Veneto's lasting impression expired Saturday at the stroke of midnight.  Over all, I think Veneto is a great place to dine. Don't get me wrong. This place is a hidden gem, for the service, the price and the overall experience make this place worthwhile. Just don't expect an \"Oh My God\" moment from your food... or expect to dine in peace from the noise of street traffic, car alarms and awful music.",

I'm talkin' really delicious Italian food.  Who knew!  Apparently two other Yelpers!!  I guess I should have looked this place up on Yelp like a good little Yelper would and then I would have known a while ago that I should check this place out.   Everything I had here was excellent- the app, the entree, the dessert- all delicious.  I had the bruschetta, the spinach ravioli and affogato (espresso and scotch flavors with chocolate chips on ice cream).  I also got to try my boyfriend's food, and everything was delicious as well.  This place is my new favorite restaurant!  And if the weather allows, they have this perfect little patio with twinkling lights for you to dine in.",

    "text": "is it because I have been to Venice, that I had to rate this place a 3?  Since I have particularly good taste, and know how to cook, I tend to be very critical of meals that I can reproduce myself, thusly leading to a more acute assessment of taste and experience. With all that being said (pats self on back) I just can't recommend Veneto Trattoria for those with discerning taste. Food aside, the decor, atmosphere, and location are nothing special. The service however is excellent, as our waiter scored 2 points for the wine and dessert recommendation, besides he had an Italian accent, and and old world charm that I couldn't help but like.  Ok, so back to the food. The dish I had, a homemade egg noodle pasta dish, with a variety of fish and shellfish, in white wine scampi sauce, was good. Not, great, but good. I have made a better seafood pasta, and the portion was pretty small, so I had to resort to dipping fresh bread in the sauce. (which really isn't so bad) I even finished my dates lasagna, which tasted exactly like Chef Boyardee. I thought to myself out loud \"either Chef Boyardee is a genius and has captured the taste of traditional Italian lasagna, or this lasagna just isn't very good. Either way the wine and dessert were superb. So would I recommend this place to someone? Perhaps for dessert and wine, but I am sure you can get a similar experience elsewhere that serves better entrees. I most likely won't go back, but had a great time anyway, with my date.   Classic moment: after hearing a cough repeatedly coming from outside the restaurant, I couldn't help but look. The cough was deep, penetrating, and harsh like the sound a ship's hull makes as it crashes into large waves. It was brooding.  As I turned around to look at this poor old man, dying of cancer, coughing while waiting for Death himself to come, I was shocked to see this 12 year old sitting at a table in front of Starbucks, hacking away!  Wow, that kid can cough, can someone get him a cough drop. \"RICOOOOOLLLLLLAAAA\" I wondered if he had the lasagna.",

    "text": "A few months ago, we stumbled across this a great little Italian place, tucked away unassumingly in a strip mall. Having been there three or four times now, this is one of our favorite go-to's for a classic Italian meal! The wait, even on a Saturday night, has never been more than about 15 minutes, and the staff are knowledgeable and quick.  On our last visit, we started with a wonderful appetizer of seared scallops and greens. They were a little on the small side, but delicious! They were cooked perfectly (so tender!) and the sauce that came with them added a great flavor. They also bring focaccia and white bread to your table, paired with a garlic'y butter that isn't overwhelming. For my main meal, I had an awesome orecchiette pasta in red sauce with sausage, and I ate every bite! It had just the right amount of spice, and was cooked in a delicious, creamy marinara. I think that my all-time favorite here is still the seafood pasta, but I was feeling adventurous, and enjoyed trying something new! We shared a good bottle of red wine, and were glad to take it home when we couldn't finish it. (Tip: If you like their wines, the restaurant sells the bottles outside of actually dining with them... then again, I don't know how you could come here and not enjoy the food!)  The place is charming and has a cozy, old-world vibe that makes the already genuine food and service feel even more so. The staff welcomes you warmly, and you'll leave with a full and happy tummy, as one should from a great Italian place!",

The staff clearly are not trained in customer service or restaurant etiquette (e.g. grating cheese on the lady's dish first, refilling water glasses, etc).  They hung around the bar area and eyed us as we progressed through the meal.  I couldn't understand a word that our waiter said and he completely disregarded the specifics of my questions.  He could hardly remember the nightly specials; of the vague, unintelligible list about seven dishes, all I caught was \"chilled tomato soup.\"  Shortly thereafter, diners at an adjacent table inquired about the types of pasta on the menu.  Mr. Ego condescendingly responded, \"what kind of pasta do you like?\"  They went back and forth several times until the customer decided against pasta altogether.  I don't blame him, what a hassle!    The food was completely underwhelming and overly salted.  Portions were unimpressive and basic things like mashed potatoes and pasta obviously originated from a box.  The chicken scallopene was so-so; the meager serving of veggies were the star.  I had a taste of some shell pasta with spicy sausage, it was unremarkable.   Don't waste your time (or money) on overpriced, lackluster food served by a snitty,  impatient waitstaff.  Sorry fellow Yelpers, I just wasn't impressed; I am not compelled to return.",

Well, that's not all we do.  We shoot people, launder money, and violate the RICO act in about a hundred different ways. But wait, that's not all. We eat. And we eat, and eat and eat. Even when we're not eating, we're planning our next meal.  And sometimes, when we get sick of cooking and eating we go out to eat. And where do we go?  We only go to small, non-chain Italian restaurants. Why? Because there's usually some guy in the kitchen fresh off the boats who cooks Italian better than God himself.  And that's why I come here. For a real taste of Italy, and not the culinary slop from some chain whose kitchen staff is about to get busted by Sheriff Joe.  The veal saltimbocca, wedding soup, and pasta e fagiolo, combined with their bread, chianti and olives will make you feel like you're at your aunt's house for Sunday supper. The only thing missing is your aunt and her hairy upper-lip.  Now, mangia. And remember, watch what you say. The Feds are listening in.",

I'd only been there one other time and it was years ago.  I was there on a first date with someone and while we had a decent meal, we did not have chemistry and it took me this long to return to the restaurant!  Anyways, back to my latest visit... our waiter, Maurizio, was just attentive enough and had the cutest Italian accent.  Doesn't everything sound sexy when spoken with an Italian accent?  One bite of the fresh bread and olive oil, and we knew we were in for a treat.  I started with an \"insalata Veneto,\" which was very good.  My aunt and uncle had the vegetable soup (they were out of minestrone) and insisted I try it since it was so good... and they were right!  For our entrees, I went with the seafood special pasta of the day which was exceptional!  They shared an order of the ravioli and the gnocchi and loved them both.  We all shared a Crema Cotta for dessert.  Crema Cotta is Veneto's version of creme brulee with wild berries.  Deeeelish!  I will not wait long to return to Veneto Trattoria again.  Highly recommended for anyone that is a fan of Northern Italian Cuisine and homemade pasta.  Look past the strip mall location and check this place out!",

As an affiliate of a popular pasta company (blue box) based in Italy, we were offered a gift to dine at the Chef's Table at this restaurant the day after Thanksgiving.    This place is a nice little gem that brings the flavors of Northern Italy to the palette.  Although we were staying at a 5 star resort nearby, this meal was the one that will have the lasting memory.  When we arrived we were immediately sat at a large 4 top near the front of the restaurant which had a full view of the room even though we were only 2.  Roberto, the owner, came to our table right away and explained that we will be having specialties of the house paired with wine.  No menu was presented.  A fresh and hearty rustic bread with a good crust and olive oil were set on the table with our first glass of wine.  Before each course arrived, Roberto came to our table to announce what would be served.   These surprises throughout the evening enhanced the dining experience.    Our plates included:  House made Bacala (salted cod) Mousse over grilled polenta House Smoked Beef Carpaccio with mixed greens Funghi Misti (mixed mushrooms) over creamy polenta Fettucini Tirolesi with speck, onion and cream Pasta Pomodoro with olives and pepperoncini Poached Wild Salmon with a chiffonade of vegetables in a ginger-lemon brodo Spumoni plated with Tira mi su  Espresso and coffee (espresso perfetto)! Chilled Limoncello Wines served were a Gavi and a chilled Lambrusco.  Roberto checked in with each course to ascertain our satisfaction as did Gabrielle our Waiter who was equally as accommodating. Susan, Roberto's wife joined us during dessert as we shared stories (like visiting old friends). It's interesting when traveling how many people have crossed the same paths in locations you share.  A sincere Grazie goes out to Roberto and Susan for your charm and hospitality!  We truly enjoyed the experience at your restaurant and as I said, your food makes my mouth sing.....

We had gnocchi with a walnut sauce that was horrid and inedible gray sauce with potato lumps pretending to be gnocchi.

But I don't mind sitting at the bar, and Felix (the bartender) was someone I would have missed if I sat at a table.  He was really helpful, thoughtful and makes a great martini!  The food was amazing...I got the Baccala and it was incredible.  Just the right amount of food, and just the right flavors blended together.  If you want a table on the weekends, make a reservation.   But don't skip going to this place!",

    "text": "My favorite Italian place, esp for a workday lunch!  Torn between 4 or 5 stars.  I pretty much avoid Italian restaurants like the plague (dad's from Italy, so I'm pretty snobby about my Italian food).  But a friend convinced me, and this food is delicious and authentic!  (Just a warning though - if you like greasy, garlic powder, sauce-from-a-jar \"Italian\" food please don't come here and write a bad review.)  On a positive note, terrific tiramisu and I love the grilled vegetable plate.   Great service too.  Some might say they're slow to bring the check but Italians do not rush people out of their restaurants.  It's refreshing.  I have had the same server pretty much every time and he's awesome. He's either Italian or a really good actor.",

I'm only giving it 2 stars because the atmosphere was really nice although when my date and I first walked up at 6:00 pm we asked if we could sit on the patio since there were a dozen open tables and (Susan) I guess she may be the owner but very rudely said NO we have a two top right next to the noisy and busy entrance, kinda like the shitty table next to the bathroom that no one wants. Ok we dealt with it as I was on a date and didn't want to ruin the moment. So when it came time to order are meal this older RUDE sever I didn't even get her name or she also would be mentioned took our order and we NEVER saw hind nor hair of her until it was time for the check and even than my date had to wave her down. No personality whats so ever!!!! Food was very average and nothing to brag about. I travel all over and trust me this place isn't all that!!! So take it for what it's worth I would never go back as there are many better choices in the valley..",

The service was fantastic, our waiter was wonderful and so attentive. The food was just as great as the service! I had the Integrali Caprese pasta with spaghetti. All of us in our group enjoyed our meals and were all impressed with the wonderful service.   Since I do travel to area for work I will definitely make it a point to come to Veneto again.",

    "text": "I have noticed a gross inflation of ratings in the Scottsdale area. I cannot understand how this restaurant has the star rating that it does. Do you people not know what good food tastes like?!   The menu was small and we found it difficult to choose dishes because nothing sounded all too appetizing. In the end we went with spaghetti with clams in a white sauce and I ordered the whole wheat spaghetti margherita. Both dishes were incredibly bland and boring. I couldn't even finish half my dish because it was too al dente and just too plain. Looking around I noticed that a great majority of the other patrons were the senior citizen crowd, so perhaps the dishes are catered to their palates (and wallet sizes) because each dish was not worth its value.",

I didn't have a choice going here because it was a group decision. Now that you think I am a huge brat let me redeem myself. This place is delicious. It is not your Olive Garden type of place. It is actually real Italian food. The service was great and we were a big group of 12. I tried a little bit of everyone's plate and it was all delicious. I highly recommend the calamari pasta. The sauce was light but had a lot of flavor. If I ever do decide to eat at an Italian place this will definitely be the place I will go.",

The waiter was less than friendly, the food was not warm and relatively tasteless - i had the limon chicken...  Let me compare to a neighboring restaurant, Humble Pie, which is just on the face a basic pizza place - but the staff was super friendly,  very attentive and the food was hot and quick. Handles down i would suggest their neighboring restaurant - menu was not has extensive but service was better and consistent.",

    "text": "I was introduced to this bit of Northern Italy by an internet date. I didn't go out with her again but I have returned to this restaurant. This is a small, well laid out, romantic restaurant located in a strip mall. There is small, full bar and nice covered patio dining. The mostly Italian wine selection is respectable and reasonably priced. The menu has some dishes and there are nightly specials.  They offer a buratta version of a caprese salad that is very tasty. I tasted the osso buco (using pork shank rather than veal) and a crusted halibut special. Both dishes were flavorful and excellently prepared. I especially enjoyed the halibut! There is a cioppino on the menu that I am anxious to try. My first date and I split the tiramisu. It was prepared with a sauce that made the dish very disappointing. Tiramisu is my favorite Italian dessert. On my second visit, my friend and I split the creme brulee. This is my second favorite dessert, and while it was superior to the tiramisu, it was disappointing. Coincidentally I was attended to by server Diego both nights. He was pleasant, attentive and efficient both times. I will definitely return to this restaurant. If they can improve their desserts I will probably add a star. If the cioppino is as good as I have heard we make it to 5 stars.",

Let me just say, I wondered HOW I didn't know about this place sooner.  I ordered the Chicken Milanese, which was great, but what REALLY blew me away were the meatballs and absolutely delicious sauce!!  I received a card in the mail from the owner's (handwritten) thanking me for coming, so it jogged my memory to write this review.  I was very impressed by the fact that the owner's took the time to send that card and thank a patron.  I will FOR SURE be back, in fact the day I went there I raved about them on Facebook.  Other notable things to mention:  The service was excellent, and the ambience was nice too.  And they have outdoor seating as well.",
