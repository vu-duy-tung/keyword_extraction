The woman who helped us was genuinely warm and smiley- her daughter was so sweet- heard me quietly tell my boyfriend I wanted baklava and she was all excited to get some for me.   The food was great- and we were excited to have gluten free pita bread , gluten free tabbouli made with quinoa, babaganouj and lentils and rice. The market had an array of Lebanese and middle eastern goodies. The freezer had frozen homemade gluten free feta pies and other deliciousness.   Also- that baklava was darn good. I am happiest when the food is great - home made - and the people running the restaurant are happy humans.",

So what did I think of the meat at this place? First of all.. why isn't it thinly sliced? But it was very tasty and full of flavors!   I like the schawarma to be wrapped properly in its pita in foil. The pita is on the side and you stuff it yourself. There's a lot of meat - the way it should be! The tahini sauce is good.  I like the tabbouleh - refreshing. Whenever you add olive oil with vegetables and toss it together with small diced vegetables, how can you go wrong? You can't! I toss some of it in my schawarma because whenever I eat schawarmas....I like it when it has thinly sliced meat with tahini, tomatoes, lettuce and grilled onions - maybe I am asking for too much or I don't know what an authentic schawarma is (this is what I get back at Undergrad - if you went to Davis, Sam's is SOO GOOD!)!  Guy at the counter is super nice. They gave us the wrong dishes at first, we stared at it for awhile...then he realized it, he apologized and just took it and brought it to the other table - made us laugh :) because...  1) He just assumed we didn't touch the food 2) He could have given us free food for doing that 3) He could've left the pita and gave us the couple a new pita 4) The couple who received our food did NOT notice it was sitting at our table for 5 minutes  I might go back again if other people insist but I probably won't insist. I had my taste of it.   FYI - I walked in and I was surprised to see a market - that's all.",

The service is friendly, but the food took 20 minutes to receive... I know, good food takes time...but not really worth the wait.   I had the Chicken and Lamb plate; the lamb was good, not great- the chicken was spiced well but DRY- but not too dry that I needed to return it. I also had the Hummus- it was just Hummus, nothing distinctive or outstanding about it, The rice was bland and a little dry- needs a little more dill in my taste The Tzatziki was clearly homemade since it was a bit watery- also needs more dill and not just a cucumber and watery yogurt with little lemon juice combination. The Tabbouleh was fresh and \"clean,\" I only wish the portion was larger since that was the winner of the plate. The Baklava was very clean and crisp- she does an excellent job with the filo dough and its sweet enough for me without being overpowering.   The grocery portion of the store is lacking in variety and mostly dusty from a clear lack of any outside employees with only a huband/wife team and children on the weekends labor force is just not enough to bring this place to what the potential could be.  I might try it one more time for the Gyros.",

For starters - the falafel is served in a fresh pita (baked fresh at the deli!), through-and-through, a very satisfying experience. For a little zing, add their hot/spicy sauce which has a nice hot kick, but not burning (it's also good mixed with hummus).  The dolmades were excellent with crisp grape leaves that have just the right amount of *snap* to them. Not too soggy, not too raw - perfect. I've eaten these my whole life and can confidently say that they are made with care and attention! The tabouli was super fresh and aromatic - it was the first time I'd had it and it was a pleasant surprise.  At the recommendation of the owner, we had the lemonade - which is sweetened with honey and made with rose water - and it is very refreshing (I had half and half with tea/lemonade).  For me - one of the minor highlights were the kalamata olives WITH pits, which are much firmer and more enjoyable than olives that are pitted. It has a great grocery selection and a wide variety of fresh-baked foods in their freezer section included (but not limited to) pastitsio, moussaka, tiropita and spanakopita.  The owner was very, very accommodating and attentive to us - and the rest of the staff was very friendly. It was a warm, inviting experience and I can't recommend it enough.",

I also like their eggplant sandwich...and it is even better when you put falafels in the sandwich.  Mmmmmmm!  Lemonade is ok, a tad too sweet for me.  A perfect place for a satisfying lunch!",

It's primarily a grocery and bakery, there's a kitchen in the back and they have about a dozen tables. There were about 3 tables filled when we arrived but by 12:30 every table was full, there was a line at the counter and people filing into the place. We each had a different dish, and we were all happy with our meals. I am going to return here and would recommend it for lunch or take out.",

The owners couldn't be nicer or more helpful and they went above and beyond in their service to both of us before, during and after our meal. The food is delightful and flavorful and very traditional and the fact that they offer GLUTEN FREE on most of their menu is outstanding. I picked this because of the other reviews and because my daughter eats mostly gluten free and I am also trying to cut wheat from my diet. I recommend this great homey place 100% but please don't expect fancy at all. It is a deli inside a wonderful little store and there is generous seating for such a small place but not tons. I had Shwarma sandwich and it was wonderful.",

I use to go a lot back then, when the owner Alex somehow disappearred to the Middle East ( maybe finally getting married ).  They use to stack their portions with a lot of meat. Since new ownership, they are cut back on the protons but the food is awesome as usual. Their mix grill and chicken kabobs are a must try. With the aromatic smell of their rice along with a side salad with greek dressing, it compliments the meat very well. Their homemade lemonade was very tasty and the owner is very nice along with his staff. Kinda like home cooking except when they get super busy, be prepared to wait awhile, but well worth it.",

I immediately felt welcomed by the owner who introduced himself, and gave me a little background info after I told him it was my first time in. He had several vegetarian meal options on the menu, which always makes me happy. I got the spanakopita plate with a salad (a real salad, not just a few iceberg leaves with shredded carrots) and a lemonade. Yes, THE lemonade! I swear it induces euphoria, it's like the perfect spring day, melted down and poured over ice. Anyhow, I saw that they serve Arabic coffee (which I love), so I ended up sitting awhile to enjoy a cup and chat with Isam (the owner), who has got to be one of the most amicable men in Phoenix (which reminds me, I must bring my Dad in for dinner). I ended up bring my bff in for coffee and treats this morning. We also got some falafel and hummus. The falafel was perfect, crispy and herbacious on the outside, and soft and moist on the inside. We left fat and happy, and with two cups of lemonade :)",

I'm a student at Phoenix College and for my biology class we had an assignment to go to a store of another culture and study the food they eat and the main ingredients of their diet. I wanted to do a different culture that I didn't know that much about. Since it's just right down the road it was the perfect place to finish the assignment but still be able to get back in a few hours to go to lab.   When we got there I told the man that I had an assignment so walking around with a piece of paper and looking at things wouldn't scare him into thinking we were from the health department or something. He was totally fine with it and we went on our way to getting the assignment done. Of course the cultural experience comes with actually trying the food from the culture. I got some pita bread with hummus while my friend tried the imjadora. We shared so we all got to try the different things. The food was very good! Not only that but they kept coming over to check to see how we were doing. He even let us try the falafel which was also incredible. I am amazed not only by this great food but the amazing service that my friends and I received at this place. I have to say it's the best I have ever seen at a restaurant and we will definitely make it a place to eat lunch at more often.",

It had pretty good flavor but it just didn't seem super authentic. The salad on the other hand was perfect, it was an actual salad not a sad pile of iceberg mix like many other places have.

I find the portions to be reasonable, and the quality of the food top notch.  Go to the counter, place  your order, and they'll call you up to do a pick up when it's ready.  Nothing like going in for a quick lunch and walking out with a bunch of grocery items, a chunk of feta, a pound of tabbouleh, and a bag of freshly baked pita breads.  I'm a fan of their food overall.  There are excellent options for vegetarians.  They also make outstanding stuffed grape leaves.  True story- during one of my pregnancies I craved these, and went twice a week to get them.  They are as good now as they were then.  There is seating here, so you can go with a small group and have lunch easily.  Don't forget to pick up some freshly prepared baklava for dessert!",

Hummus & baba ghanouj are obviously very divisive topics, but the baba-g here is the best I've ever had - so smoky!  so creamy!  The market is a great feature, too - olives & feta, lots of dried goods, seemingly out of place cookbooks from a serious called \"this bitch can...\" (e.g., \"this bitch can cook for a party\").  Not the best (or cheapest) Middle Eastern food I've had, and not the best market, but somehow the place is more than the sum of its part.  The rosewater lemonade is kind of what pushes this place into five-star territory - the stuff is DEFINITELY the best lemonade I've ever had, and hits the spot on our hot summer days.",

What is great is that the pitas fresh are just as good as non-GF - so unlike most GF breads you don't have to toast them for them to be tolerable.  They also have this very thin round bread thing that we have started using at home to make a pizza roll-up. You can buy all the GF stuff (minus the tabouli) and freeze it safely with out damaging the quality. You just use a toaster or a toaster oven for a new seconds to thaw. These folks are kind and their food is lovely.",

Of course I wanted the food to be as authentic and as amazing as possible to complete the evening.   To that end, I used this little gem of a place for most of my food needs. Their hummus is good and the tabouli transcends any I have ever had, there must be some magic ingredient that makes it pop with flavor.   At the last minute I needed a greek salad to feed 10-15 people. The owner gladly pulled off a tray of fresh colorful salad and gave me a great price since I had purchased so much food there. I also got an assortment of desserts and they were all amazing. By the way, If you go there, do try their excellent lemonade; it's not tart as they spike it with honey. So, my party was a total success and I give credit to this deli for delivering quality food that is rich with flavor and freshness.",

I am immediately skeptical if the gyro meat is not carved off a vertical roaster (I am sure there is a more proper name for that thing) and instead looks like it came out of some sort of preformed mold.   Unfortunately at this place, it does not appear carved. The gyro is all the same size and each piece looks exactly the same. It tastes fine, but nothing that blew my mind.   The hummus here is pretty good, and I do enjoy the Greek salad.   Solid execution. Nice staff, casual atmosphere. You won't be blown away, but you won't be disappointed either.",

Their falafel is excellent; the tahini sauce, thick and tasty (not like the watery stuff at other place); and their meet dishes grilled to perfection. To top it off, we enjoyed the freshest baklava I've had in a decade with a perfect cup of Turkish coffee (with a touch of cardamon). Authentic, fresh, unbeatable Middle Eastern food!

    "text": "This was my first visit to this place in about 9-12 months.  The food is always outstanding, so no issues there.  Today I got the Lamb Shiskabob plate, but substiuted chicken for beef.  It comes with either Greek Salad or Tabouli, and I always order the Tabouli.  As always, the food is delish!  The rice has a nice buttery taste to it, and the meat is well-seasoned and tasty (although a little on the dry side -- just a little).  The lemonade, which is made using orange flower water, is so refreshing and delicous -- this is a must if you come here!  So why am I only giving 3 stars?  I am disappointed because they have raised their prices, but are giving less food.  For people who are new to this place, it's not a big deal because they don't know any different.  But not knowing they changed their menu, I placed my order over the phone using an old menu.  The old menu says that my entree is served with tomatoes and onions, in addition to the rice and Tabouli, so I was quite disappointed to not see any tomatoes or onions in my dish when I opened it (they are also not listed on the new menu).  It also looks like they are skimping on the meat.    On the old menu, these were the prices of the items I ordered: entree - $8.99; hummus - $2.99; and lemonade - $1.29.  These are the prices on the new menu: entree - $9.89; hummus - $3.99; and lemonade - $1.99.    I know, I know, if an extra $2.60 is going to send me into bankruptcy, then I shouldn't be eating out anyway.  However, it's more of the principal of the matter.  I don't mind paying a little more money if I'm getting a little more food.  But to raise prices and then give us less food?  That's just a food sin!  This sin won't prevent me from coming back again, but I just had to express my sincere displeasure with this. :)  BTW, I agree with other reviewers that the owners are extremely nice people!",

What really makes the place stand out is the service.  I'd like to share a recent experience I had.  After ordering some take out, I struck up a conversation with the owner, who was eating breakfast.  We discussed the various types of feta available, and which kind was best.  This guy, the owner, sliced off a piece of cheese from his own breakfast and gave me a sample.  That's right, he feels so strongly about his goods that he was willing to share his breakfast.  I love this shop and only wish that the hours of operation were more in line with my schedule.",

It is like a family.   One funny fact is that to use the restroom you have to go behind the front desk. The restroom is small but impeccable. I am very picky with restrooms. It is clean and that is what I like. It has not to be fancy just clean.  My favorite food is tabouli. The best in town.   Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",

    "text": "I am often way too lazy to write a review but this place is so amazing that I must do it.    After reading on Yelp! about all the goodness of this place, I gave it a try. I love middle eastern food and grew up in NY where we have very good middle eastern food.    I was greeted very warmly by the owner, Isam.  I told him I heard about their famous lemonade so I will have that and something else he would recommend.  He gave me a sweet smile and told me that the lemonade is on the house as it is my first time.  (how nice!)  I ordered to go the Lebanese chicken (one breast split in halves, rice, tabouli, and one large fluffy, pillowy pita made fresh) and the falafel (smaller than I'm used to but very tasty) that came with tahini sauce that is very very good.    I finished my drink before the food came and he gave me a free refill!   I wanted to get a lemonade for my coworker to go, and he gave me that for free too!   He was very easy to speak with.  I hate going to places where the food is great but the owner makes you feel like you should beg (think Seinfeld and the soup nazi).  But this guy was very nice.  There was a lady behind me who went for the first time yesterday, and came back today with her friend.  The owner immediately recognized her and apologized to her for something.  It turned out that there was a guy (I think from the store next door) that was bothering her as she walked in yesterday.  She told the owner about it. The owner (after she left) spoke to the guy and he apologized to her for what he did yesterday.  The owner also apologized for the guy's behavior.  What a man!  My food was really really good.  And when he packed my food in the bag, he gave me two big slices of bahkalava on the house (again)!!  I am definitely coming back and bringing more people.",

    "text": "Awesome, awesome, awesome.  Seriously, color me blown away.  And add another all-star to a growing list gems along the 16th St corridor in central Phoenix.  Step inside a totally unique Phoenix establishment along 16th Street just south of Osborn and you feel like you've been transported to a small Levantine grocery store halfway around the world.  Within this grocery store you'll find a variety of hard to find Mediterranean culinary items as well as a small sit-down area for those who want to have a meal from the kitchen and/or one of the numerous freshly baked pastries.  The Yelp reviews told a pretty wondrous story about this place, but I needed to see this for myself.  I had done some research on this place through Yelp in advance, so I had some picture of what I was getting into.  I was however torn about what to get.  The grilled combo plate was my original thought being that it contained foods I was comfortable and familiar with.  But then I figured this is a Middle Eastern spot so go authentic all the way, right?  So the regular combo it was.  Kibbeh, stuffed grape leaves, falafel, gyro, and tabbouleh.  It also included hummus, baba ghanoush, and tzatziki sauces and a side of pita bread.  I also got a slice of baklava for dessert and a small lemonade (since apparently everyone says it amazing).  Total cost for the food and drink plus tip was about $16.  They had everything ready for me in about 5 minutes.  Okay, full disclosure.  I've never had kibbeh, stuffed grape leaves, baba ghanoush, tabbouleh, or baklava before.  So this really was a shot in the dark for me.  In fact I had to look up the ingredients afterwards to figure out what I had just eaten.  I won't take up space on this review explaining the ingredients, but wikipedia can sort it out for you.  The most important information I can convey is that the taste and the texture of each and every dish exuded a fresh, pleasant texture without any heavy aftertaste.    The falafel was fantastic and the tabbouleh was wonderfully seasoned.  The kibbeh, gyro, and stuffed grape leaves had just the right amount of meat and were cooked perfectly.  Every item paired perfectly with any of the three sauces they provided.  Falafel goes with anything of course, but seriously these were some versatile sauces that you could pair with just about anything.  The pita bread was warm, soft and soaked up those sauces real good.  And the baklava, oh the baklava.  Crazy delicious stacks of filo dough with a light, nutty, grainy middle.  Just the right amount of sweetness and the perfect portion.  And yes, its True what you've all heard.  The lemonade is amazing.  They say its all natural with orange flower water.  Sure, okay whatever.  Whatever it is, keep doing it.  By the way, the small lemonade size is closer to a medium in reality (not that I was complaining).  There isn't a single thing I would've changed about my meal here.  Everything was spot on.  The flavors were superb.  The staff was friendly.  The price was right.  And I left satisfied, full, but not uncomfortable.  I can't wait to try all the other goodies on that menu and all the tasty pastries in that display case.  And hey I might even buy some grocery items here sometime.  A quick tip, park behind the restaurant.  There's a gated lot in behind the restaurant with plenty of space so you don't have to jostle for one of the very few spots up front.  One you're parked, walk in and let your taste buds run wild.",

And honestly, if you don't have any experience with Middle Eastern food, you might get lost in the food aisles. But for my friends with Middle Eastern or European descent, you will feel right at home. I almost cried when I found Turkish coffee, which I haven't had in almost a year since the last time I went there. I even found feta cheese pita bread that tasted just like something my Anneanne would whip up at home. You won't be disappointed!",

The falafel was one of the best I've ever had and the homemade hot sauce was very good as well. After lunch, I also tried their Turkish coffee and baklava, and both were absolutely delicious, highly recommended!! It was the perfect end to an enjoyable and tasty lunch. If only I lived here, I would have looked deeper into their grocery section and stocked up on a few things. Anyway, the staff was sweet and accommodating and the owner was personable and such a pleasure to speak with. I wish I was able to make it back to have some more coffee and baklava and try the Lebanese Chicken plate. I'll just have to come back next Spring! Thank you for a wonderful experience.",

I had to walk around to find someone to take my order and answer my questions. Couldnt find anyone and the place was empty. Finally a woman greeted me. I asked about the Giro Pitas sandwiches and they sounded like they were kinda small so I got 2. I had to get the pita breads too. I grabbed a bag and they were still warm at 11 am. I sat down at a table where behind me there was a couple of tables that were dirty and looked like it was sitting there for a while. I received my food and it looked kinda lame. It was half wrapped on a big white plate which made the sandwich even look smaller. Usually when I go out some sort of side was given, be it rice, chips, fries, soup or a small salad. Kinda disappointing for the price. I bit into sandwich and the pita was to die for. Soooooo good. The meat was very different and flavorless. It seemed boiled and very wet. Did not enjoy at all. Usually its carved off in strips, nice and crunchy or carved and then grilled. This was wet and soft. Part of my pita was even soaked and wet. Not appetizing. Too bad. I really wanted to take my wife to a new Mediterranean restaurant. I will go back for Pitas, but that is all.",

Well, \"next time\" became today for lunch, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I ordered their kibbeh appetizer and a falafel pita sandwich. The kibbeh, again, like at Haji Baba, was served more like a piece of pie rather than a dumpling with a fried bulgur wheat shell, but this time, happily, the meat was well seasoned. Their falafel was fresh and soft inside, with a bit of crunch on the outside, and nicely spiced. The portions were just right. I would definitely come here again. Already, I look forward to trying their Middle Eastern spinach pie, which I haven't enjoyed in a long time. I know some people might find it unusual to have a restaurant in the middle of a grocery store, but I was not put off by it. In fact, after eating, I had the opportunity to do some browsing and spotted jars of an Egyptian lentil soup spice blend on sale, which I intend to buy during a future visit. As far as my first impression is concerned, the Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli is a hidden gem near downtown Phoenix. Give it a try.",

After the third party got served, we went to the owner and told him we never received our food. He went to the kitchen and said that it'll be right out. We sat down and another person that ordered after us got their food. Then a few minutes later ours came out.  To add more insult to injury, the owner was out on the floor talking to regulars that had ordered after us and had already received their food. The owner was either too busy talking to notice that we hadn't received our order, or simply didn't care because we weren't regulars. Needless to say, we will not be returning to this place.

Beef was overcooked. Rice had like 3 pieces of veggies (corn, peas, and carrots underneath). Tabouli was pretty good.  I will come back, and try their gyro before I give up on this place, but for now, 3/5 is the best I can do.  Mid Fresh on Mill Ave is still my favourite Middle Eastern restaurant.",

She also explained the difference between feta cheeses and how we wanted French feta for our hot dip because it melts the best.  They were really busy and she took time to share all of that with us.

The menu is posted on the wall above the counter you order at, it has many items plates, pitas and more.   I went with my middle eastern usual, a falafel pita ($5.49) It comes stuffed in a round 6-7 inch pita with some hummus, tahini, lettuce a tomato slice and some onion. The real star here is the fresh crunchy, small falafel balls that are moist and packed with flavor. The hummus completes this flavor package while the tomato onion and lettuce are just along for the ride. The pita is soft and fresh..  My only complaint is at 5.49 is it about $1 more than a good value.   My coworkers went with a few different plates that included chicken, rice salad and a pita, they also enjoyed their food.  When we left there were no free tables so get here before 12.",

Immediately upon entrance the owner greeted us with the warmest welcome and sweetest smile. He knew we were first timers so he took his time going over everything on the menu in detail. Can't say it made our decision making process any easier though, considering he described each option as being \"THE BEST IN THE WORLD!\" But I loved it. He had full confidence and enthusiasm about every single thing he served,  and it showed.  I would have to agree that the lemonade and baklava were the best around. Don't get me started on the fresh falafel, with a side of special spicy sauce, omg. The chicken was cooked to perfection, and the hummus and pita bread definitely hit the spot. The meal most certainly impressed me, and the grocery corner was a nice touch. But my very favorite part of the meal was the part where he treated me (and my lunch date) like royalty. He was out to make sure we had an exceptional experience and showed us the kinda service that you just don't see much of these days.   He welcomed us with a smile and we left with an even bigger one, as he was sure to check on us on the way out. Definitely worth a go! Go, go!",

We ordered the combo that gives you one of each kabab (chicken, lamb, and qofta), rice, and salad (we opted for tabouleh here), plus a side of falafel. We washed it down their lemonade (made with rose water and honey- DELICIOUS!) and finished it all up with a slice of baklava and a cup of cafe turka.  The owner was a sweetheart. I told him that I like his falafel better than my own, which is a real compliment coming from me, as I often brag about my falafel. But his are fantastic. They are the perfect tiny bites of delicious.  Also I love that this place also has a kosher/halal grocery setup right there, in case you want to chance your arm at making any of these fine foods at home!   I'll be back often.",

We wanted to bring back some baked goods after our vacation and found some raving reviews online for baklava.  Our quick pit stop turned into an unexpected experience learning about cardamon Turkish coffee, baklava and lemonade from the owner himself.  He was one of the sweetest and definitely knew how to make his customers laugh and feel loved.  I've tried to make my own baklava once and burned through $40 worth of ingredients.  Now I just pay the $3-4 because it is worth it.  The baklava here was good, but my favorite was the lemonade.  He mades it with orange, honey and rose water. Somehow, we accidentally poked a hole through the styrofoam cup on the way to the airport and lost some of the drink.  It was painful for me to loose those couple of sips knowing that I won't be back to Phoenix anytime soon.    It makes me happy when owners are happy and treat their customers right.  Take my money!  I'll forever miss the lemonade here.",

I decided to go with the lebanese chicken, which came on a bed of rice and choice of salad or tabouli. Pita bread was also served with this meal. And I tried the rose water Lemonade. When the food was brought out everything looked great and well put together. The chicken is a little thin but still was moist and had a nice lingering taste , the rice was my favorite part. Some of the best rice ive ever had. And the tabouli was fresh and a generous amount of it. Pita bread was good as well. I wasn't disappointed with anything. And the lemonade...oh boy that lemonade.. I could drink it forever! It's sweet but not too sweet and the rose water just adds a new dynamic to it. I will definitely go back to eat here and strongly encourage others to do the same.",

I came on a weekday lunch and it was moderately busy. I had the Lebanese chicken plate and a lemonade. The chicken had good flavor, it was a bit tart from the lemon/yogurt and seasoned well, although it was quite thin and dry, possibly because it was so thin. The rice was satisfying, cooked and flavored well. I wasn't a fan of the lemonade, although I am a fan of really tart lemonade and this one was lacking that. It also had too much of a floral note for me. My entree + lunch was around $16 before tip which is a bit too expensive for an everyday lunch. I'll probably give it another visit or two so I can try some of the other items and give this shop a fair shake.",

There's no strong overwhelming Arab or Israeli influence, just a perfect, little mecca of all things authentically Middle Eastern, from Labneh to imported Pareve chocolate spread.  Location: A funky fresh exterior covered in graphic art, like World Peace signs, baklava, camels and snakes... and generally sparse parking.  Food: A surprisingly diverse and wonderful selection of food to please the meatless palate. We ordered the vegetarian sampler, which is a solid one-person sized lunch consisting of a pita, four falafel, a spinach pie, four little dolmas, baba ganoush, hummus, tabbouleh, and tzatziki. The falafelim were better than the ones I had in Jerusalem. So blasphemous... yet so crispy.  Other: They have sheep's milk cheese. That is a big deal. Also, their iced tea and lemonade are both delicious, meaning the potential for the perfect Arnold Palmer is right at your fingertips.  In a word: Unique. This is the most accommodating, authentic, friendly, and, dare I say, seemingly neutral Middle Eastern restaurant and market I have yet to encounter. If you're not convinced of MEBAD's worthiness by now... dir balak. Now go eat! B'tayavon!",

It's kind of a unique gem that you don't see anymore with the owner at the register and a slamming lunch business in addition to the grocery items for sale that are rare foods, snacks, and ingredients from the Middle East.   I suggested this place for lunch with Amy D today after reading about it on Yelp awhile back... so happy I finally made it there myself!  As Amy said in her review, we shared the baba ganoush and hummus plate and we each ordered a Greek Salad.  The salad was decent but nothing special, but the baba and hummus with the whole wheat pita was so damn tasty that we didn't even leave a bite.  The free cup of homemade daily lemonade was a perk and the owner was really sweet... and I really did like the flavor of it.  I happen to love lemonade!  I'll for sure return to MEBAD when I'm in the area to try more from their menu... this is the kind of place you want people to know about since you can tell how much work the owner and staff put into it each day.  If you haven't been, stop by... maybe I'll see you there - but please don't ask me to share my baba ganoush and hummus with you - I'm ordering my own next time!",

    "text": "I thought I reviewed this place ages ago and realize that it was all in my head. Perhaps because I live so close to it that I thought I reviewed it by osmosis.  Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli is a one-stop shop for a lot of Middle Eastern foodstuffs, from jars of olives to tins of nougat and from 4-foot tall hookahs to intricately carved wooden backgammon boards. The market is small, and as such its offerings aren't nearly as abundant as Baiz Market a few miles down the road, but it has most core items well in stock.  As for the food, I've had the chicken kebab plate. I realize this is what I order at all of these joints, but it's a good gauge to see how each establishment prepares this dish. Chicken may seem easy, but to do it well you have to marinate the pieces long enough and cook it just right so its not pink or conversely not dry.   I thought my plate was a decent, albeit standard, effort. Nothing about it really leaped out at me, but would I eat it again? Probably. I've done it twice more already. I've also had the hummus and tabbouleh which were decent.  That said, I'll have to order other dishes, like the lamb, to see if the extra stars are lying elsewhere. There is a case displaying baklava and other desserts, in case you happen to be driving along 16th St and develop an intense craving for some out of nowhere.  All in all, 3 stars for now. It's a solid, little establishment that provides all the basics, in both the restaurant and the market. Perhaps superlatives will come in the future. Downside is that they close early - 6 pm, so unless you leave the office in time, you're out of luck.",

It tasted more like a wet salad. The shawerma however, was delicious. It had more than enough meat, the flavor was good and it was very filling. I would highly recommend the lemonade, that was also tasty. Again, opt for the shawerma and skip the gyro!",

The honey flavor meets the lemon with just the right balance. Delicious.",

So, without being biased, I'll list what was good from this particular spot:  Great lemonade which is accented by orange flower.  Great falafel! Yes, the falafels here are wonderful and bite size!  Great pitas. A little on the pricey side for a bag of them, but I've been eating them all week and I don't feel like I wasted a penny.   **They also make their own pita chips dusted with za'atar! Those with some labne would be scrumptious!**  Good shawerma, got a pita sandwich with tahini and was pretty pleased.  Okay hummus. Definitely not the best I've had, but much better than the plain stuff you might get from a super market.  I'm definitely going back to try more! Next on my list are the spinach pies, their labne and their fresh pitas covered in za'atar.",

I asked the kind gentleman at the register about a particular pastry. He explained the ingredients and said it was burma. Which was also yummy. What really blew us away is that before we left the owner treated us to his award winning lemonade. It's made with lemon, honey, and rose water. What a treat! He was very proud of it and with every right. It really was amazing. We will definitely return and try a meal (the Lebanese chicken caught my eye).The place gets 5 stars from me for the exceptional customer service and delicious pastries.",

    "text": "Nothing I could say in this review could possibly convey the amazing experience that we had here at Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli.  This was THE BEST place at which I have eaten in all my visits to Phoenix (off and on annually over the last 10 years) and I will be back (multiple times) every time I visit from now on.  Why is it that the taste of the food is so often inversely proportionate to the fanciness of the restaurant, at least when it comes to ethnic restaurants?  The fancier the decor in an ethnic restaurant, the blander the food.  Stated differently, what is it about the mystical siren's call of the hole in the wall ethnic restaurant?  Does the chef assume that because his food is head and shoulders above the rest that he needn't waste money on decorations?  Or is it simply that the mom & pop chef with his traditional recipes handed down from generation to generation will never be matched by the cookie cutter american culinary school education?  This restaurant is very unassumedly named The Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli, though it is also a restaurant and grocery store.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, nor the inside, and would probably fly under most people's radar if it was not for word of mouth passed through Yelp.  Can you see the diamond lurking under the layer of carbon?  I sure can.  The proprietor, Isam (yes, we're on a first name basis now and you will be, too, by the end of your first visit), is quite a character guaranteed to put a smile on the face of even the WORST sourpuss.  Before our first visit we called him by phone to make sure the restaurant would be open when we arrived and he was friendly and welcoming.  When we finally arrived he welcomed us like old friends.    I ordered the grilled combo and my coworker ordered the Lebanese Chicken.  Both plates came with a choice of Greek Salad of Tabbouli with a fresh warm pita and rice.  I wasn't sure which to choose, so Isam guided me gently toward the Tabbouli which he makes FRESH 5 TIMES EVERY DAY.  Yes, you can tell this man is incredibly gifted in the making of Tabbouli, which is a thing of beauty, colorfully decorated with red and green pepper rings, white couscous, tangy red tomato, crisp white onions, and ruby toned sliced beets over dark greens.  It is beautiful, but tastes even better.  I ordered a diet soda in spite of the prominently displayed Yelp tip recommending the lemonade (\"Your life will change as you discover the super powers you've acquired from the lemonade.\") as I'm not usually a big lemonade fan.  My coworker ordered the lemonade and I ordered the birds nest baklava with glistening green pistachio pieces covering the top to eat while I waited for the food to arrive.  My coworker took one sip of the lemonade, which is made with honey and rose water - SHEER GENIUS - and couldn't stop talking about how amazing it was.  I traded him half of my baklava for a taste and couldn't BELIEVE how amazing it was - TRULY LIFE CHANGING.  Isam brought me a large cup of this elixir of the gods and made my entire day.  When our meals came I was thrilled with my perfectly seasoned kebabs with three kinds of meat -  chicken, lamb, and spiced ground beef, all of them cooked perfectly and all of them delicious.  The rice was not basmati, more like a pilaf, but was incredibly flavorful.  Alex said his Lebanese Chicken was amazing, but refused to share any with me.  The owner brought us over a complimentary Turkish coffee, a lemonade, and a pistachio baklava - all amazing!!!  Isam also gave us a lesson in appreciating coffee.  He taught us how to sip it and about his secret ingredient (cardamom).  He grinds his own cardamom fresh from the seeds, which cost $100 per pound and I guarantee you are totally worth the expense.  He showed us both the seeds and the ground versions and let us smell them, pure heaven on Earth.  Isam says that the cardamom works on your nervous system to relax you;  I certainly felt relaxed when I left, but I think some of that might have to do with the owner's charm rather than the coffee.  When we left, we stopped up at the counter to say goodbye to our host, because it just felt more like a family visit than a restaurant visit.  You can just walk out of a restaurant, but you don't walk out on family without saying goodbye.  I made a return visit several days later and not only did Isam remember me, but he came out from behind the counter to give me a hug and asked where my friend was (I had just dropped my coworker off at the airport).  I ordered the Lebanese Chicken and one of his heavenly lemonades.  Isam once again brought me a Turkish Coffee (this stuff is addicting) and a baklava to enjoy with it.  I enjoyed my second visit as much as my first; Isam gave me a menu and invited me to come back again during my visit.  He even gave me his phone number and told me to call if I needed anything.    I will definitely be back!!   Relaxes you, works on your nervous syst",

    "text": "I've never actually had authentic Middle Eastern food before so I have nothing to base this on, but it was delicious and filling!   Got the \"shawerma\" which seemed like mostly beef (it says beef and lamb on the menu but not having lamb before, I couldn't tell the difference), marinated and grilled, with a side of Greek salad (basically a regular ceasar salad with tomatoes, feta, and pickled turnips). It came with a side of super soft, delicious pita bread - which is baked fresh every day. I made a sort of taco with it and it was amazing.  The meat pieces weren't quite what I expected (my knowledge of shawarma comes 100% from The Avengers film so I expected shaved meat wrapped in a lefse served in foil) but it was more akin to carne - but marinated and cooked to perfection so absolutely NO complaints here. The food was super fragrant in the best way and a little food filled me up. We also got the lemonade which won the New Times Best Of Phoenix award. It's fresh lemonade with rose water, honey and orange water (?) instead of sweeteners/sugar. It has a very strong honey flavour and is almost like drinking incense. It made my breath smell great after the shawarma and was really unique and delicious. Free refills too!  Because we mentioned it was our first time, the owner offered Turkish coffee and their baklava - super delicious! The coffee comes in this cute tiny cup and has cardamom (one of my favourite spices!) in it and the baklava was super good. The filo was perfectly flakey and the honey was top quality and fresh.   All that food and drink for under $13. AMAZING.  They also have a few aisles of imported and in-house foods. I got a pretty large bag of pitas, a 16oz thing of fresh hummus and a bag of super soft \"cracker\" bread (markook? chapati? I'm not sure what it's actually called because it wasn't labeled) for under $12.   I'm super impressed with this tiny local shop/restaurant and I will definitely be back!",

I'm eating one as I type this, no joke. I'm now a starch addict again thanks to Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli. I don't know if that's a good thing or not ;)   Seriously, I can't say enough good things about this place. Their rice is to-die-for. The lamb and kafta kabobs are the best. I've found the chicken kabobs can be a little dry at times so I generally go for the darker meats. The salads are the best I've ever had, their dressing is amazing. Oh, and their lemonade is the best. It's made with rose water and honey, you HAVE to try it! I'm not a huge lemonade drinker so I usually get an Arnold Palmer to cut the sweetness, or as the owner likes to call it, an \"Arnold Schwarzenegger.\" Seriously, get the lemonade or an Arnold Schwarzenegger, you won't be disappointed.   Every Friday I work in downtown Phoenix and come here to pick up a multiple packs of gluten-free pitas and get a fab lunch. I always think I'll try someplace else close to downtown but I just can't pass this place up.   The owner is super knowledgeable about his food and extremely sweet.

    "text": "I walked into the restaurant with high hopes and high expectations after reading the reviews posted here on Yelp and I was pleasantly satisfied. I hadn't had good Middle Eastern food since I moved here from NJ, I had a great coworker who every now and then would make me Moroccan meals and desserts. Now I know where to go to get my fix. They offer food for everyone who enjoys Middle eastern cuisine, from meat eaters to vegetarians, and even have gluten free options.  I myself today asked the owner what he suggested and I decided to order that.  He suggested the Lebanese Chicken that came with a Greek salad, rice and a pita. He also gave me some of their famous lemonade as well. Now this lemonade mind you was reviewed by New Times as the best lemonade in Phoenix. Now I know why, it's pleasantly sweet and refreshing, sweetened with rose water if my taste buds serve my memory right.  My meal was delicious and filling in every aspect I wished it to fill. The Greek salad was salty and tangy just like it should be, now I'm not normally a Greek salad guy, as I'm not going to join an olive lover's guild but this Greek salad changed my opinion on olives.The salad contained pickled beets, tomatoes, red onions, lettuce, olives, cucumbers, and their dressing.  It was great, to put things short and sweet.  The pita, was soft as a pillow but tasty, unlike a pillow, don't ask me how I know a pillow isn't tasty. The pita was warm, soft, delicious and I used it to clean my plate clean after I finished my meal to absorb what remaining flavors were left behind, just so I wouldn't waste them. The rice was wonderful, it had tons of flavor, and not overpowering. They gave a large amount of it as well, which for me, a big fan of rice, mad this meal even better. The rice contained peas mixed in and I think saffron. The chicken I had was delicious as well, it was chicken breast, in a lemon and herb spice, grilled. It wasn't too salty and the flavor wasn't overpowering. All of the items in the dish accompanied each other well. All of these items together as a meal were very fairly priced too. After AZ sales tax, my meal came to $9.83.  I will definitely go again, this time to try a vegetarian option and I highly recommend you going as well.",

Honestly it was like nothing I have ever had before. It was so good! The food was good and reasonably priced. It definitely had a warm family feel to the place. The market carried gluten free pita bread which I thought was a rare find. Overall I give this place a 5 star review. If you go, do try the lemonade, you won't regret it.",

However you can also dine in an order some of their delicious homemade food. I enjoyed the chicken kabobs accompanied with hummus and a greek salad. The meal was filling and fabulous.

Like the spinach pie: delicious, Baked Kibbie awesome. The standard dishes are great too. The chicken gyro was loaded with chicken, spice, onion, tomato and a delicious tzatziki sauce.  Service/Price: Pita sandwhich and my side dish was out in 3 minutes! Price was very reasonable.  Overall: If you down with an authentic and unique way to take in some Middle Eastern dishes, head this way!",

The menu is simple, fresh with flavor and plentiful.   I almost always get the vegetarian plate, not because I'm a vegetarian but because it has a variety of things I love to eat.   It includes stuffed dolmades, tabouli, hummus, baba ganush, tzatziki and pastry stuffed with spinach. All of that on one plats and you also get freshly made pita bread which I  believe is baked on the premises.   One of my lunch companions has a food allergy, and not the first time while dining at this establishment. The owner stopped by and checked in on her to make certain everything came out alright. She had the grilled chicken on top of salad minus the cucumber.   Don't forget to grab a lemonade flavored with rose water to pair with lunch. It's refreshing and delightful.    When you're in Phoenix and near 16th Street & Earle, seeking out a lunch suggestion, why not give this place a try.",

(i've tried the baklava, cookies and one pistachio treat) the flavors are good...it's just a mild sweet as opposed to a more traditional U.S. dessert sweet. again, just not my favorite but it's admirable to have the case featuring sweets nonetheless Parking: a few spaces in front but plenty of spaces along the side street to the north of the restaurant (there's an antiques shop on the corner) Bathroom: it is clean if very old...but again, clean. and you have to slink your way behind the cashier and around the kitchen to get there -- a little awkward but file it as part of the restaurant's charm i guess. it is what it is. small space...family place. there ya go.  the food that comes out of the kitchen is always high-quality and quite delicious. the staff is so friendly and efficient. the owners really seem to have a passion for what they do. in all, a gem. one of Phoenix's True best family restaurants. excellent quality, respectable passion. thank you to this business.",

There are also many GF options, including GF pita!   I had the vegetarian sampler.  Delish!  I loved the size of the falafels - they are on the smaller side of what I'm used to and they were perfect!  Everything was seasoned lovely.  I tried some of my husband's rice and I wish I had gotten a side of it, it was so moist and flavorful!  The rose lemonade was a nice touch as well.  It wasn't exactly lemonade, more like a sweet rose drink, but so yummy.  The owner was friendly enough to give our family complimentary coffee to enjoy with our desserts with!  The baklava wasn't overly sweet which was a nice change from the honey doused ones I've had elsewhere.    Only regret is we live in San Diego which is faaaaar from here, otherwise I'd be back over and over!  Also, I can't get down with the Styrofoam - time to switch to something more eco friendly!",

Rosewater, honey, fresh lemons, and freshly brewed tea all combined to make a drink that is so epic you'll wish you could put a ring on it and a baby in it! Haha. So epic.  Ordered the Lebanese chicken and the flavor was fantastic. Perfect even. But the chicken was overcooked and tough. This dish has the potential of be amazing. The rice was solid.   Fresh made breads are fantastic as is the chill, super casual vibe. The owner and his staff are stunningly friendly and accommodating. Really great people who we are excited to continue to support.   In terms of where this one ranks amongst other Middle Easter restaurants we've tried, I'd say top 5 in the valley. Easily a top 2 restaurant if their meat was not overcooked.

Don't worry-just order it.  it misses 4 stars for a few reasons.  Some of the packaged goods seem aged. It's really hot in there. The gyro meat is weird. They microwaved my meat pie....",

Last time we went, my wife saw some dates on the counter for approximately $4.00 a pack.  We were already in the car when my wife asked me to get her some dates.  I was charged $8.50 for 1 pack.  We both went back to the deli and my wife explained that she saw the price less than 30 mn before.  The owner denied it, refused to reimburse the difference.  Although we were going there at least once a month, we are now afraid to be overcharged.",

    "text": "So I went here for lunch and I gotta say I was very pleasantly surprised.   I was really in the mood for middle eastern food and searched on Yelp for locations. When this one came up I was intrigued so I decided to check it out. When I arrived I was a little concerned as it was a convenience store looking place rather then a restaurant but one side is dedicated to the food. I ordered falafel balls with Hummus as well as the Shewarma.   The falafel were great!! Very well done and tasted great dipped in the hummus. The Hummus was a bit greasy but thats ok...reminded me of the real stuff! :) The shewarma on the other hand was mediocre. It is very hard to find good shewarma that is prepared right and sliced right. This was more bits of Chicken (Which is not the traditional meat) that were marinated then stuffed into a pita.   I would come again and try the Gyro and I'd have the falafell again in a heart beat. Their Pita bread is baked fresh there and is delicious...you can also grab a bag to go if you want fresh pita.   Overall not a bad lunch spot....I have yet to find a great Shewarma place in the US, but the search is still on.",

The owner is incredibly welcoming and always has a smile on his face.  He is well versed on the food he is serving and will accommodate any customer needs. The food itself is incredibly authentic.  I would recommend the gyro or shawarma, some hummus, and if you are feeling hungry, tabbouleh. For a unique and delicious drink, you have to try the award winning orange blossom and rose water lemonade. It is sweet and cold; perfect for a hot summers day (which we have so often in Arizona).  For the occasional weather change we get during December, I get a nice hot cup of Turkish coffee with cardamom with a serving of baklava, you will be so glad that you did.        Now on to the bakery/grocery part of the store. They bake fresh Pita, Baklava, sweets, and other assorted breads daily. Nothing beats the taste of a fluffy and warm pita. Just the smell alone will guarantee that you do not leave the bakery without at least one bag (or maybe 2 or 3).  They bake fresh meat pies and spinach fatayers every day, but if you want to save some for later, they have plenty of frozen versions of their foods that defrost and cook up great!",

Seriously. I think it's a powder because it just taste strange.   Seating can be tight, especially for wider bodies like mine but the chairs are sturdy and comfortable.   Order the lunch specials, specifically the kebabs. That meat is tender enough to cut with a spoon! And the flavours are incredible. If you order a lunch plate, choose the salad which comes with an oil based dressing so good you'll want to ask for it to be served in a glass with a straw. I'm. Not. Lying.   One more thing: the food is separated in your to-go!  The rice sits in a basket. The meat is enclosed in foil and the salad has its own compartment. Yeah, I'm one of those who hates food to touch. Don't judge me.   There are other Med eateries close to me but this is where I return time and time again because I love the food, and I can't stop obsessing about the lemonade.   I need help, I already know.",

    "text": "Shout out to Isam Saed and Argentina Alverez (Tina). I never thought I would say this, but it was the first time I walked into a shop and felt like I was meeting family.  BACKGROUND STORY (feel free to skip) My experience at this charming bakery and deli helped me realize that there are not enough of these adorable, mom and pop shops. Last Friday, I had planned to stop by a different middle eastern bakery after this amazing pistachio baklava I had in California a couple of weeks prior. Strangely, there was an update that same day that the shop was permanently closed. We happened to drive past this store on the way to lunch, and with my wonderful sense of direction, did not ask to immediately stop since I thought it was on the way back. Anyways, my significant other was kind enough to backtrack and I'm so glad he did.    THE SHOP So there is parking directly in front of the store, it's a bit of an abrupt turn since you're coming off of a busy street. As you enter, to the right are products that are frozen that you can take home and to the left are items from the bakery, where you can place an order from the deli, and find a place to sit. I learned from the owner that the shop opened over 50 years ago, making only pita bread. And that he and his wife have owned the shop for over 10 years. Learning it was our first time at the store, he kindly greeted us with a full serving of complimentary lemonade, regardless of my small order. The owner was very warm, enthusiastic and proud of the shop --as he should be! He informed me that they use only honey to sweeten the lemonade and that it had even won an award. The shop also offers party platters, which I think is fantastic.  OVERALL I would not be doing justice by giving a food review since I have not yet grabbed a meal at the deli. I also have to admit that I have not had enough middle eastern food to confidently evaluate whether something is \"good,\" or not. Nonetheless, the variety of food options they offer is very impressive, so I highly recommend stopping by to grab a bite if you are in the area. I enjoyed most of the pasties I picked out and had to grab a bag of pita bread after the story the owner had told me. He also provided helpful advice to freeze whatever I did not consume that day and that it could be reheated. The generous hospitality from Isam and Tina made our visit an incredible experience and I wish I lived locally, so I could do a better job supporting such a wonderful business.",

The nice gentleman at the register gave tons of suggestions on what to order, so I decided on the chicken kabobs! Basic, I know... but so good! Came with rice and a side salad. I also ordered hummus and pita (delicious).   To drink? Their special lemonade!!! Amazing. Can't remember exactly what was in it but I think it was like orange flower and honey. Whatever it was, was the best lemonade I've ever had. Since it was my first time, I received a free piece of baklava with pistachio! So good. Def will come back",

I just need to realize this is Greek, Lebanese, ect and it's NOT the same ... Have to give a shout out for the freshest pita I have had though as well as hands down top 3 in baklava",

There was a large selection of olives, fresh feta, tzaziki, and tabouleh salad.  Baklava was made to look basic by all the other selections of desserts available. I definitely got the vibe this gem is well respected by their foodie community, everyone had their favorites.  The dining area is window side 16th street and seats maybe 8-10 people comfortably.  There is a certain charm and authenticity that will bring me back for more.",

On a Friday night, I decided to stop in for dinner. It was one of the best tasting meals I've had.   The menu is huge, and the authenticity of this place is amazing. When you walk in, the right side of the store has authentic Middle Eastern foods, groceries, and spices. The food and service was great. Ordered the Lebanese Chicken with salad and rice, and it was delicious. From looking around the store, they have a ton of frozen food items to take home and some good looking coffee.   Great place for a different experience or to bring someone out of town to try some local Middle Eastern food. And, a good first date place if you're looking to impress someone special :)",

However I have noticed that over the past year or so the Greek salad is looking less like a Greek salad and more like a side salad. No feta cheese, a few mushy tomatoes and a single kalamata olive. I had lunch here a few weeks back with an out of town guest who ordered the eggplant pita. There was one slice of eggplant -- the rest of the sandwich was lettuce. Why do you continue to charge more for significantly less food??",

I am from the Metro Detroit area, where there are endless choices of delicious Middle Eastern restaurants.  Today I was just craving a fattoush salad with grilled chicken, fresh hummus, whipped garlic and that fresh out of the brick oven pita.  Well I got some hummus, which was ok and seemed fresh. But the salad had only 4 pita chips and Chicken was so dry it was inedible. In fact, my second piece I attempted, had a disgusting grey color inside and nasty after taste. I had to immediately spit it out and throw it away. The bread was not as fresh as it should of been.  I'm giving it 2 stars for the hummus, but not worth a trip back.",

    "text": "Warning: this review is going to be positively glowing. If you're not in it for the long-haul, I understand. Try this place. Try the lemonade, try the turkish coffee, try the tabbouleh, try the falafel. If you don't mind a longer review read on:   The owner, Isam,  couldn't have been more friendly, informative, generous or helpful. When he found out it was my first time at the restaurant he insisted that I try the lemonade, baklava and turkish coffee (I completely agreed) and then  *bam* he insisted that they were on the house. I was not expecting such a generous offer and I was more than happy to pay for these items myself, Isam's pride of ownership is genuinely impressive. He seems to run his business from an old-school model based on integrity, a little showmanship, and a product that truly sells itself.    I proceeded to order, Lebanese chicken and grape leaves and wait for my food. They brought my lemonade, and to be honest, I really had no idea what could have possibly been so wonderful about lemonade that I would just HAVE to try it. Well, I have three simple answers rose water, orange blossom, and honey. They don't put any sugar in their lemonade, it has this beautiful delicate floral taste, anchored by a richness from the honey. You will love it.   The lebanese chicken and grape leaves were ahhmazing. The tabbouleh is incredible and balanced to perfection. Not too much of this, or that...just right. The owner tells me that they go through about five batches per day. I believed him.   Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli was so delicious, I began snapping pictures of my food and plotting my yelp review while still in the restaurant. I began bragging via text to all of my foodie friends. I took a to-go order for friends I was meeting up with later, it seemed like a nice gesture, but really I just wanted to have an excuse to try more of their delicious fare.   Per Isam's insistence, he brought a piece of baklava and turkish coffee. The baklava was delicious. The shining star was the turkish coffee. My god. Best. Coffee. Ever. Seriously. If nothing else, go here and order lemonade and turkish coffee. You will be thrilled.   If I don't eat at this place at least once a week as long as I live in Phoenix I'm going to be disappointed. I can't wait to go back. Upon leaving the restaurant I noticed a new gyro place had opened two doors down. I actually felt sorry for them, their business is probably going to tank by proxy.",

(I haven't tried the meat (because I'm mostly vegetarian) but my meat-eating friends say it's yummy too.)  3, the grocery, deli and bakery have a good selection. They make very addicting za'atar gluten-free pita chips (and gluten ones)...so good to dip into their jalapeno hummus! They also make pita chips with a cinnamon sugar topping which seem to disappear suddenly everytime children are around. They carry some unique and hard-to-find feta cheeses, spices, and jarred items (like nuts in honey). If you are having a party, there are lots of ready to serve or heat and serve items (the spinach pies are great!).  4, the omg-I'll-sell-my-mama-to-get-this lemonade! Delicious and homemade. Note to vegans--it's made with honey. It's been awarded best lemonade in the city many times by the Phx New Times...the praise is well-deserved!",

I thought I was in episode of hoarders, that's how bad the bugs were.",

My husband and I just moved to the area and tried out this place for lunch today. They really made me say \"WOW\". The pita bread is soooo soft. All the dishes on my vegetarian sampler plate were made just perfect with great taste.   Their lemonade is so special. I'm not a big fan of lemonade as it is too sour for me but this lemonade is not sour and has very tender taste. I think they said they add rose water or/and orange blossom water.  The food here is way better than that at Beiz Market. Grocery area is kind of small but they have the right items for middle eastern cooking. And in the freezer you can find the dishes on the menu like grape leaves, pita, spinach pie, etc. so you can bring back home and eat later. They also have fresh bakery of course. We bought feta cheese pita bread.  I can tell from the food they really love food and really know how to cook.  I have a feeling I will go back to this place very soon.",

    "text": "Beyond impressed with the owner's hospitality and kindness! This is a very casual place with a small store and deli. Everything tasted super fresh and they sell a lot of gluten free items in the deli and freezer section.  My husband and I went here for dinner on our way (from Tucson) to a baseball game in Phoenix. I searched google for a restaurant with gluten free options and this place came up with very positive reviews.  When we got there the owner greeted us warmly and I asked what he suggested and told him we haven't tried Middle Eastern food before. He told us the combo plate would be a good sample of lamb, Lebanese chicken, and beef. It came with a Greek salad and rice, but the owner also gave us a side of gluten free tabouli (free of charge!). Everything was great! Moist meats, perfectly cooked rice, and fresh salad (olives contain pits).  We also ordered hummus with pitas. He gave us extra gluten free pitas (free of charge again!). The hummus was sooo good! A really nice light garlic flavor and the pitas were AMAZING. We couldn't get over how light and fluffy, slightly chewy the GF pitas were.  The owner gave us free drinks. The lemonade is flippin awesome. If you go, you HAVE TO order it. Also free were Turkish coffees and samples of baklava and halva. The baklava is not GF, but they are working on a GF recipe for it. My husband felt bad about saying how unbelievable it was haha. I really liked the halva, it had great flavor and consistency.   The shop was well stocked and had a lot of spices and good variety of items. When I asked the owner about if they sold the coffee we tried, he brought it over and asked if I wanted to learn to make it, he said he take me back to the kitchen and have them show me how! I WISH we had had more time to learn. He also gave us fresh, warm GF pita to buy instead of the frozen!   We plan on going back soon.",

We were starving, so we both ordered a full shawarma plate - the food itself was absolutely delicious, homemade and fresh. The owner, Isam noticed that we were from out of town and asked us for a picture, which we were very flattered. He brought us hummus and pita free of charge but the generosity didn't end there. He sat down with us, shared many fascinating stories about his own life and travels. He then gave us both a large lemonade, Turkish coffee and baklava for free (the best lemonade either of us had ever tasted I might add). When we told him we were in town staying at an airbnb down the street, he told us to come in anytime we wanted any food - for free. He is the most generous, kind and genuine man that we have met along our travels. The environment in the bakery is amazing and all of the staff were friendly and welcoming. He sent us off with 3 tubs of hummus, tabouli, pita and more desserts. We felt right at home and will be forever grateful for this experience. Thank you, Isam and family for your kindness.",

I'm here to review that one item: The Lemonade.  As I walked up to the counter to place my order, I was greeted by an older gentleman I can only assume was the owner of this establishment. As soon as I told him I had heard good things about the lemonade, without even skipping a beat, he replied, \"It's the best in Phoenix.\" I cordially laughed. He did not. With a very straight face he pointed to the wall behind him. There were about five plaques given out by various periodicals and city magazines going back eight years. All read \"Best Lemonade in Phoenix\".  My chicken gyro was so-so. But you better believe I ordered about a gallon's worth of lemonade. And it definitely lived up to the hype. With hints of rosemary and mint, this lemonade stands alone.  My suggestion: Go here in between meals. If you want some midday refreshment, it does not get any better than this lemonade.",

You must order it when you go here! We also got Turkish coffee and baklava.  The coffee was in tiny cups and very STRONG.  My mom loved the baklava as it was very fresh and very flaky.  This is a very different experience from most restaurants.  It was nice to sit and chat rather than be rushed with our meal and leave.  Clearly, those who were eating there that day were used to this very relaxed way of eating.  The owner was very nice and came over to our table to talk with us.  We learned he was from a close suburb to us, so we had a fun time talking about \"home.\"  The woman who made our food also came out to clear our plates.  We expressed our thanks to her for making such a great meal and she was very humble and sweet.  Go here!  You'll love it!",

My husband and I arrived 10 minutes prior to closing and Isam was so inviting to us. We placed our orders, mine the falafel plate and my husband ordered the Lebanese chicken plate. On top of this we ordered a large hummus plate. Hypothetically speaking if we could have ordered the entire menu we would have! Everything sounded amazing on the menu.  Alas, the famous Lemonade, we just had to try, made with honey and rosewater. I told Isam that this was our first visit and I had to try his famous lemonade, and he lit up like a Christmas tree and said \"this is your first time here?!? Lemonade on the house for the two of you.\" No way?! Ya way! The lemonade did not fail us, it was delicious!! So refreshing and the flavors worked lovely together!  Now onto our food plates....the hummus plate was delicious! They put ground beef cooked in olive oil, garlic and onions and sprinkled it on too of the hummus and boy was it delicious with the pita bread!! My falafel plate was amazing, the falafel nice and crisp on the outside and cooked and moist in the middle, it tasted amazing with the pita, tabouli and hummus together! My husband kept on raving about the chicken and how tender and flavorful it was, I had some and he had to take the plate away from me before I devoured it all! Haha!   We still had half of the hummus left and Isam came up to us and asked if we wanted an extra pita bread on the house to eat with the hummus! Uh, YAH!   Not only was the food delicious this place exceeds in the customer service department, Isam was just a delight and to give us lemonade and pita on the house, this place just rightfully owned their 5 stars!!",

The middle of this story consists of me inhaling a falafel pita (with homemade hot sauce and pickles inside) which was better than most falafel I ate while recently in the Middle East (but not quite as good as Amsterdam Falafel in Adams Morgan...ooooh DC I miss you!!).

Turns out, he used to own restaurants (including my fave) in the same Chicago neighborhood that I went to college in.  We-eird.  We really hit it off and had some nice conversation about how great Chicago is and how much we miss it (I know, I know, probably not the right audience)... and then he asked me if I had ever eaten at Pita Inn.  Um, HAVE I?  HAVE I?  Um, yes, I used to be addicted to Pita Inn, thank you very much.  The best hummos in all the world.  He said, \"We have very good hummos, but ours is second only to Pita Inn.\"  An honest man.  I appreciate that.  Then he proceded to give me all types of freebies, \"You should try... Oh!  and this... and this...\" I heart Chicago solidarity.  Enough gushing.  Their food was delicious.  Really good.  But the SERVICE was second-to-none.

    "text": "My boyfriend works at the pawn shop next door, (not nearly as seedy as it looks - stop in and buy some junk!), and I love middle eastern food - those two cardinal reasons are what prompted me to visit the Middle Eastern Bakery, and I have never been disappointed by anything...except for the parking and the long waits.   The falafel is delicious...some of the best I've ever had, and while I do not consider myself to be a connoisseur, I do consider myself to be relatively well-versed in the arts of falafel! I love the lemonade. The hummus is probably the only thing I am not crazy about...it is pretty basic, without a lot of accouterments and extra ingredients. This might really do it for you, but I have developed an unfortunate taste for hummus that is less authentic and more \"fancy.\"   Parking is difficult at almost anytime of the day, because the businesses right there, (the pawn shop, the Middle Eastern Bakery and the antique store), have their own parking lots but experience overflow from the other businesses frequently. Pawn shop customers park in the Middle Eastern Bakery lot, and vice-versa. However, don't be discouraged by a full front lot! There is a large (if a little forbidding-looking) parking lot behind the Middle Eastern Bakery - it is perfectly fine to park there and walk through the little alley to the Bakery.   Esam, the man who owns/runs the Middle Eastern Bakery, is very friendly and funny. If you visit often, he will remember you and will often surprise you with fun freebies - I have received more free halva than I could ever eat. You will receive more charming and personalized service if you go when it is slow, (morning time, after 1:00 PM), but I have never seen him be curt or unfriendly.   Speaking of slow vs. busy times - if you are going there at any time close to your lunch break, you will find it to be very busy. There are usually two long, discouraging lines - one, of people ordering their food, and the second of people waiting to receive the food they've ordered. It can be overwhelmingly crowded at times, and it has been a rare occasion that I've made it in and out in under half an hour. If you have a long lunch, good for you! Head over there. If not, maybe wait to try the Middle Eastern Bakery on your day off.   If you are a hookah enthusiast, they have a small assortment of shisha and hookah accessories for sale. They also sell a variety of middle eastern products and knick-knacks.",

Too bad, because I was looking forward to going to all the other Middle Eastern restaurants in town and comparing their falafel to MEBAD's, which is the best I've had in town so far.  The falafel at MEBAD is usually fantastic. Crispy on the outside, moist and tasty on the inside.  It's not overly oily and I've never had a dry falafel ball. And they're just the right size, about the size of a pinball. Occasionally I'll get a batch that is only slightly warmed up instead of freshly cooked, but they're still quite good.  The falafel sandwich is fine -- there are four or five balls in a pita with fresh lettuce, tomato and tahini for under $5 (I think) -- but I prefer the a la carte order, 5 piece falafel with a side of tahini and fresh pita for a couple bucks. I usually order that as an appetizer,  to share with others or eat myself in addition to a sandwich when I'm extra hungry.  Other than the falafel, I'm partial to the chicken gyros sandwich or plate. It's pieces of grilled chicken breast with lots of yummy middle eastern spices (which I think are still made and sold on premises) and caramelized onions. Couple that with tsatziki sauce + fresh pita and you've got one heck of a meal.  If you've got a sweet tooth, try the rice pudding, it's excellent. The baklava and halvah are great, too, but the pudding is the real winner. Made fresh daily and usually sells out. Now, if they could only make a dessert out of falafel....",

I'm Middle Eastern and know good Middle Eastern food. This was hands down some of the best in the valley. The falafel was Perfect: crunchy outside and moist inside- so flavorful. The Grape Leaves were some of the best I have EVER had. I am typically not into grape leaves but this place has made me fall in love with them. The hummus was so good, tastes like its just been made fresh for you to order. The bread was amazing too. Nothing like fresh from the oven hand made Arabic bread- I could live off of it alone... They are known for their homemade lemonade so I had to try it. Delicious! Naturally sweetened with honey and made with rose water- very unique flavor that put a whole new twist on Lemonade. - A Must Try. It hit the spot after a long day rock climbing in the sun :) After such a delicious meal I also had to try some of their homemade baklawa. I'm not usually into desert but couldn't pass it up after such a great dinner... It was so good! Tasted like it had just been made that day- light fluffy, not over sweetened or too filling. I had it with some traditional Arabic coffee- such a great finish to a great meal... after trying it I ended up buying 8 more deserts to take home for my  family to try too :)  This place is fantastic. I am so happy I found it today. I love good Arabic food but it is often hard to find in Arizona. This place is diamond in the rough and definitely worth stopping by... The food was definitely spectacular, but I think one of the best things about my whole experience here was the service. Esawm, the owner, showed one of the most beautiful things about the Middle Eastern culture- their hospitality. I came in 2 minutes to close (not ever even realizing) and I was graciously ushered in and welcomed. I sat down for dinner and received great service and conversation. I was treated just like I was family. Since it was my first time at the Bakery since the new ownership, I was even given my dessert and coffee complimentary! I got a chance to meet and talk with all the staff and everyone was so nice and friendly. I love mom-n-pop places.  All in all this place is great and I strongly recommend it. I know I will be back very soon- probably within the week- my new favorite place to eat! :) I was so impressed with this place that I plan on having my wedding catered by them.  Definitely a MUST TRY!",

It has a small store on one side of the building and a small counter on the other side with a few beat up tables to sit at and eat.  Like I said....don't let the look of the place scare you off.   The food is excellent. Always enjoy everything I order.   The falafel pita sandwich is always tasty....some of the softest yet crunchiest falafel I've had....good stuff. Have tried the gyros sandwich too. Great flavor and their sauce just adds to the enjoyment of the sandwich.  But the hummus is what I go for. The best hummus I've ever had. Don't know what they do to it...but it's just always so rich and creamy. And has that 'nutty' flavor to it also.   Buy some of their freshly made pita bread....some fresh hummus....and you're set.  A small hidden treasure of central Phoenix.",

So far I've had their falafel pita, shawerma plate and lamb shish kabob plate.  All have been great. While I slightly prefer the food at Haji Baba's and Efe's/Med Fresh Grill, MEB&D is delicious enough that I can avoid the trip to Tempe. And I noticed some pictures adorning the walls in MEB&D of a wedding they had catered--I've now given up committed bachelorhood for the possibility of a wedding catered with such an awesome Middle Eastern food spread.  My only complaints are technical.   The hours are short: MEB&D closes at 8pm and on all day on Sundays. And the parking lot looks like it could get tight during a busy lunch rush, which I've avoided so far.",

They have lots of really interesting imported foods like a spread made out of Halwah that is a great alternative to Nutella (not that I would ever give up Nutella). The best part is that they have really good gluten free pita bread. Really, really good. Almost indistinguishable from the regular kind. They have meat pies made with the gluten free bread as well as other items, all frozen and very reasonably priced. They can make any of their sandwiches such as falafel and gyros with the gluten free pita. So thrilled!! The lemonade is justifiably well known. It's very interesting with hints of rose water, orange blossom and honey. I'm just so glad that someone has found a way to make pita bread gluten free and palatable.  Very nice and helpful staff as well.",

Nestled in between Thomas and Osborn off 16th street, turn in the small parking lot with lots of painted colors on the store front windows. The store was fun to look around, definitely won't find these items at your local Fry's. I walked up to the counter to order and was greeted by a smiling man. I ordered a small hummus with wheat pita, the chicken gyro pita sandwich and a lemonade. I didn't feel like eating a huge plate of food for lunch..maybe next time? Seating is a little tight and not many tables for small parties. I was lucky to snag a small table near the dessert case and waited about 10 minutes for food to arrive. Hummus was good but obviously came right out of the fridge. Pita was good, just wished it would have been warmed up. The sandwich was also good and the yogurt sauce inside was amazing! Apparently you only get a side of it when you order a plate, not a sandwich...bummer! The hyped up lemonade is nice and sweet. As I was getting up to leave, the owner came up to me and asked if I'd like a refill on my drink. Of course! He knew exactly what I had too...very nice! I wish they had other desserts though, since I do not like baklava and that was the majority of what they had. However, I will definitely return!",

As I waited for some goodies I noticed it on the wall and decided to try it. I didn't try it till I was driving away and almost turned around for another large one to go. But I'll be back often so I didn't. Everything on the menu looked wonderful as did the food I saw come out to other patrons waiting. I took away some Pistachio Halva which my grandson like almost as much as I did. Some Walnut Butter Cookies and Birds Nest Baklava (Out of the World Yummy.). I didn't share when I got home. I wish I hadn't eaten lunch before I went there.  I did make a smart move and I tried the Bulgarian Feta. Not your normal grocery store Feta. This was so smooth, crumbly, flavorful and had a very delicate flavor due to being made from Sheep's milk. I used it to stuff meatballs and they were outstanding. To be honest I will not have a problem, ever, driving there for that feta all the way from Mesa.  It's a destination that is worth a long drive. Don't forget to shop for some of the other items they have. So many unique things to drool over.",

    "text": "THE QUICK & DIRTY:  - 7-8 assorted tables for inside eating - counter ordering, then you get a # - moderately priced - fresh baked pita & pastries - very nice people - cool little market - very tasty food  THE LONG & NASTY:  Across the street is Rips, a local dive spot for cheap drinks, free popcorn and even freer love, if you know what I mean. Rips also has a weirdly low-extending roof that makes me wish I were 12 and had my bike with me. When you see it, you'll know what I mean.   Anyway... I've jaeger-bombed it up at Rips... several times (okay, too many times), but until today, I'd never crossed the street to the Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli.   As I sit here now by the large picture window, with my sticky, baklava fingers getting all over my new-ish iPad, I reckon I dun fucked up. This place is cool. And by cool, I mean good. And by good, I mean tasty & fairly priced.   - Had the Shawerma (described by them as \"marinated beef cooked & served with our own garlic dressing or tahini sauce\"). For $6.99, I felt the size was appropriate and the flavors were fresh, crisp and intentional. It didn't blow away my taste buds... but certainly satisfied me. The highlight was the fluffy ass pita that had been split open to hold the sandwich contents. Baked on premise, the bread was less of a chewing debacle and more of an eating occasion. Some like to gnaw. Go to Pita Jungle. Others like to eat. They'll like this place.   - Had a large Iced Tea. Another fuck-up of mine today. Shoulda had the lemonade, which apparently now are $1 per refill (still a way better deal than a free snow shovel in Africa). Tried some lemonade. BAM!! Now that stuff is deeeeelicious. Yes, with all 5 Es. Spend the loot. Accept that there's sugar. Do a little extra Crossfit or whatever you need to do to offset. P90-X?? Then have a really good life.   - Turkish coffee & baklava was excellent: sweeter than Martha Stewart after she'd been indicted for insider trading and flakier than my old roommate, Tim Tidwell, who I'm pretty sure stole my bike. No joke.   - They've got a decent sized grocery area with local (to the Middle East/Greece, etc.) olive oils, olives, grains, condiments and various frozen breads & meats. There are also many spices, teas and coffee. It's kinda like a smaller version of Baez Market. If you haven't heard of Baez, check out my review. They're only minutes away.  - Very nice people. Very! The owner's brother was filling in while he's recovering from knee surgery and we chatted about Turkey and Iran. Everyone here was warm & welcoming... I call it the anti-Mrs. White's establishment. If you don't know about Mrs. White's, it's an over-priced downtown Phx fried chicken & soul food spot. The son, Larry White, (aka \"Lolo\") opened his more famous version known as Lolo's Fried Chicken & Waffles. At Lolo's people are normal & chill. At Mrs. White's it's like being made to feel guilty as you cough up $17 (after tip) for a sloppy plate of chicken and veg, delivered to you by a grumpy employee, with no check-backs or even a tiny smile. It's insane. If you're a masochist... go take a date there... stat!  - In summary: Try Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli. It may not change your world, but it will certainly keep you smiling... which is a good thing :)",

So we ordered the Lebanese Chicken for $11.99 It came marinated in a garlic and lemon herb dressing and is served with Tastsiki and rice AND it's served with a Greek salad, Pita and rice. We didn't stop there haha we also ordered Hummus a meat pie, Falafel with tahini and of course the highly recommended lemonade (All I have to say is orange and rose water omGosh!

They have a refrigerated section in the market area with pre made dishes ready to take home and heat up which is super convenient! The rest of the market is full of middle eastern treasures that might be difficult to find anywhere else. I bought a box of rose flavored Turkish delight that I'm pretty stoked about.  At the counter there are olives and fresh feta to buy among other delicious things.  I loved that the owners family was there working. Very happy and hard working.  I stopped in today solely for some fresh baklava and a cup of Arabic coffee and my mind is blown away. By far the best baklava I've ever had and as the owner assured me, the coffee is amazing!!  I can't wait to come back for lunch!",

The Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli is amazing. I had the combo plate and a meat pie and it was exactly what I was craving. The flavors of everything were on point, the people were very nice, and I enjoyed browsing the store while waiting. I will be back again and again. The only thing I did not like was that I was hoping to have leftovers but the combo plate was just one good sized meal. They also have the \"fluffy\" pita bread with no pocket, and I prefer thinner halves with a pocket, but that is personal preference, and anyway not the highlight of the meal!",

We mentioned this in passing to the waitstaff, not for any reason or expectation. We were shocked to have several of the cooks, servers and even the owner come over and sing her a Happy Birthday. In fact, the owner was smiling ear to ear to hear the reason we were there! They even brought out celebratory Turkish coffee and baklava for us to enjoy after our meal! Been going there for years and that touch of kindness will keep us going back for many more! That, and the lemonade - it is addicting!",

I have tried the Lebanese chicken plate, falafel sandwich, and the chicken schwarma. I have never been disappointed with any of my meals. The Greek salad is fresh and crisp with a great dressing. Last but not least is the always fresh warm pita bread that accompanies every meal I've had.   I often purchase a stack of fresh pita to enjoy at home. The pita is freezable in the event that you can't eat it all right away. Today I purchased fresh lavosh that came right out of the oven!   Great service and consistently excellent food!",

Additionally, I like that they make large quantities of food and put them in the freezer so that one can buy them in bulk and heat them up for parties at home. THAT, is fantastic.   The Market is great, the food is 'meh'.",

    "text": "Not bad but not particularly great either.  I continue to be disappointed by the middle eastern food in this town.  I stopped in at lunch on a weekday and waited in a very long line.  The place was hopping.  I ordered a $7.99 combination plate which featured hummus, baba ganoush, shawarma, falafal and tabouli.    Alas, it was merely adequate.  First of all, the portions were miniscule, even for lunch.  The hummus and baba were served in little plastic ramekins (i.e., ketchup cups).  This is a bit ridiculous in and of itself - I mean hummus is not exactly a high food cost item but more to the point, neither was particularly tasty.  The baba ganoush was watery and lacking in flavor and the hummus was nothing special with no detectable garlic.  The shawarma was exactly two thin strips of meat.  Four small falafel balls. And of course one small piece of pita bread.    I asked for more bread and they brought another piece, but I'm always baffled by American middle eastern restaurants that serve you one piece of pita bread.  This cuisine traditionally calls for copious amounts of bread and one piece of bread just doesn't cut it.  So summing up, bland food and small portions do not a memorable lunch make.",

This place is awesome for so many reasons! First off the owner welcomes everyone! He is the sweetest guy ever. He is from Isreal and always has something new to tell me about his food and back home. I usually do take out here because it is my I don't want to cook/I have a cold/I want to pig out but not on junk food comfort food. They have a lemon soup that always makes me feel better when I'm sick. They have great gluten free options. The owner told me he sold out of the gf pita once because a place in California ordered his entire batch in one day, you can not tell it's gf, it's great! My boyfriend is addicted to the red pepper hummus. Some of the best baklava I have ever had. Just a great and welcoming place to have in my neighborhood. The outside is kinda dingy and the stock shelves need more frequent dusting, but it's family owned and they are truly here for us.",

    "text": "Creeping senility: I thought I'd reviewed this place in 2005. The public area is probably about 600 square feet, but every inch is jammed with Fertile Crescent / Mediterranean goodness.  This is a bakery, restaurant, and grocery. The restaurant part of the operation has a an extensive menu of flesh-based and vegetarian options. There are plates, salads, and sandwiches. The plates (kebabs, gyros, etc,.) usually come with a decadent rice pilaf, your choice of tabbouleh or Greek salad, and tsatsiki. There are a few grilled chicken dishes, and the chicken is always moist with a nice char.  MEB&D also bottles its own spices. Not as diverse as Penzey's, but it's nice to have an option on 16th St. Hat tip to Adam M. on the olives -- they're delicious.  Dessert? They serve different forms of baklava, turkish coffee, and homemade halvah (they'll slice off a piece with a scimitar-looking blade for a sample -- impress your friends!).  Tips: - You can buy Greek tobacco soap. - The soup of the day is always avgolemono. It always will be until the mountains crumble and our love is through. Sometimes there's an excellent red lentil as a second option.  - They have great par-cooked or reheatable stuff  -- it's in the frozen section. - MEB&D is an effective and affordable option to cater a party on short notice (I've done this).  IMO the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. The components are all four-star, but the place gets the fifth for the \"park-once, enjoy-many\" experience.",

Read: tasted just like WishBone.  Seriously.  I was disappointed, because I've read the reviews.  Maybe I just need to try other stuff.  It had a store inside, too, but I didn't have much time to check the shelves. Oh, and they pushed the lemonade BIG TIME!  Neither one of us wanted  it, but they did give us a free cup of it.

I am an olive snob and can't say enough about them. You can also get hummus and baba ghanooj to go, as well as their freshly made (they are a bakery) pitas.  They also have some interesting mixes, canned beans, etc. They have a lot of Sadaf products which is cool because I used to actually mail order from them once in a while!   On the lunch side, I love all their vegetarian food and often get a vegetarian platter or falafel sandwich or plate, etc. Their tabouli is out of this world good - lots of fresh mint and parsley, lemon juice, it's perfect if you are into the Lebanese taste. I've never ordered meat there but I've seen other people order it and it looked great. The food is delicious and home made tasting. Their baklava is superb. Split some with your lunch mate.   If I were to succinctly describe their food it is fresh, healthy, authentic, and delicious.   I gave it 5 stars. Not 5 stars like a fine dining type restaurant - 5 stars because they do their type of ethnic food with unfailing perfection and authenticity and consistency across multiple visits.
