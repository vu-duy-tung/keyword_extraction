Some chick names Jenn looked straght at us multiple times and kept helping people who walked up after us. Pretty embarassing. Her and another older bar back kept high fiving and talking about protein powder while there was a huge line. Saturday, fight night- you would expect a higher standard on such a busy night. Would give 5 stars but management should be aware. We finally got taken care of by another bartender named Matt. He was hella cool and fixed our experience. Big ups to those who actually work on the company's dime.",

    "text": "I gotta say, I was really hesitant to come to this location after reading many of the negative reviews, but my husband and I decided to check it out for the half-priced games on Wednesday.  I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience!  We arrived at 430 in the afternoon and decided to eat before game play. Almost immediately after sitting at the bar, we were greeted by Sandra.  She was very friendly, personable and attentive.  The food was ON POINT.  We ordered the crispy steak 'n tater cakes for an appetizer (OMG YUM). My husband ordered the bacon-wrapped shrimp with lobster sauce and fire-grilled sirloin - he would not shut up about how amazing it was and ate every last bite, I'm surprised he didn't lick the damn plate. I ordered the ultimate Mac 'n cheese, and it's that and more. Best Mac n cheese, the crispy bacon and chicken made the creamy, melt-in-your-mouth pasta to die for. My only complaint about the meal experience was that our appetizer came out with our entree, no time to first enjoy that beforehand...but hey, it was all perfect and we had full happy tummies. Sandra was sure to apply a military discount to our meal which was awesome and very appreciated.   Game play was a blast, good mix of new and classic games. I had read a review that mentioned dirty and/or broken games...? Where? Nothing appeared to be \"dirty\" and my husband and I did not come across one \"out of order \" game that we wanted to play.  We both love video games and were definitely not disappointed. Also, bathrooms were neat and clean.  We will absolutely be back soon for another half price Wednesday, highly recommend.",

The prizes are traditional arcade prizes i.e. I got a deck of cards and some random trinkets. BUT you can exchange tickets for various food items! Definitely come here just for a night of fun and games (the photobooth is a blast, though $5 cash only).   However, the service is pretty subpar. Waited 15 minutes for drinks and one never showed until we reminded the waitress. I had a salad that was OK, $6 so I wasn't complaining. The pretzel pull apart bread left something to be desired. I would've liked to try more but it's a little spendy.   All in all - if you want to play some arcade games in the West Valley, come here. Don't let \"negative Yelp reviews\" for an arcade keep you away. The prices for gaming is standard. Get food elsewhere first then come here for drinks!",

She had bought a $50 gift card for us, so we ordered four dishes, including a couple to take home. After we ate I gave the waitress the gift card so she could credit us and save a little time. She returned about 5 minutes later, announced that our bill was \"fifty dollars and change\", and that we were \"okay\", then walked off. She never showed us the itemized bill. Isn't it obvious what happened? We think the waitress never rang up our order and she pocketed our gift card. We figured the bill and I don't think we were out any money, but our experience guaranteed that we'll never be back to this location or any other Dave & Buster's for that matter. The food wasn't bad but the experience was horrible.",

I was reprimanded by a manager about their strict policy though I informed her on 7/7/18 I hosted a birthday party which I was allowed to bring cake and my coffee! She was apathetic and walked away. It's also their policy to not allow people in with tattoos, torn/ripped clothing/ hats or sunglasses! Yes!... read up people! (On their website)The manager was sleeved with tattoos on her Left arm nonetheless!! Hahaha... what a joke... I guess it will be harder to sell people games and food when they will never come back!?

Nothing is disheartening as a customer who calls in letting them know they're going to have a huge party and they want to spend money in their place, and having a very inexperienced managerial staff explain to them why they can be accommodated. That being said we've never really had good service here, but I was willing to let that slide if they would accommodate us for the Thursday night football game, which when I called it seems like nobody had a clue of how to set us up on a table with reservations for a private party which they do normally. I was put on hold at least four times, and all of those times I waited at least 15 to 20 minutes with no one coming back to the line so I hung up. I even explained it to the \"senior manager\" which was all of 21 years old, and she explained to me why she didn't understand or wasn't able to reserve a table for a private party, again other Dave and Buster's do it all the time. I asked for the district managers information which she was not able to provide other than any mail, and when I emailed the district manager I got no response even though I left my direct contact information. This just goes to show that in the mind of this particular restaurant, customer service really doesn't matter, that is the reason that the reviews are what they are. There are a multitude of other choices here at Westgate, which some are really fantastic and you should really check out, but by all means stay away from this one. Don't spend a dollar here. The low and negative reviews are very accurate.",

    "text": "On Feb 26th which was my birthday, me and my wife decided to check out this establishment as we had never been there before. My wife had a milkshake from a restaurant which she brought inside because we did not know about Dave and Busters food policy. I asked the womanl who was working at the front if my wife could finish her milkshake at a table in the restaurant and in the mean time, I purchased a card to play some games. The girl working at the front was very nice and told my wife it was okay. There was nobody else in the restaurant at the time due to the late hour.  While sitting at the table, one of the manager's came in and proceeded to talk down to my wife about the food policy. This guy was a short, fat, latino that was wearing glasses. I explained the situation to him and he agreed to let us stay. After our conversation, he went to the lady working in the front and chewed her ass! My wife decided not to stay at the table because she did not want to get the nice lady in trouble. Instead, she got a chair from a different spot and sat down to finish her shake. My wife is disabled and she can't stand for long periods of time. It was cold outside so my wife did not want to drink a milkshake in the cold. While sitting there minding her own business  another manager went over to my wife and said \"oh no you don't\"! This manager was a white woman with brown hair. She proceeded to try to get the chair away from my wife while my wife was still sitting in it! This manager was very unprofessional and condescending and extremely rude. If my wife would have fell because of this stupid woman, there would be a lawsuit coming!  Needless to say, we will never be going there again and I highly recommend that people don't waste their money at this location. Perhaps we will try another location but the jury is still out on it.",

Jim the manager was horrible he charged us one last drink and never delivered because we were cut off . Didn't even finish our play cards won't be returning here",

Our waiter I didn't catch his name a muscular black guy, what a great waiter! He kept on top of our drinks made sure we didn't need anything. My son and I played games which the prices were confusing but it came with the good which was pretty cool. It is a little pricey but I'd go back",

We've been to eat before and we aren't greeted, we don't know what area to go, and it takes a bit to get anyone to notice us.

We were then told (with attitude) that we had to wait another 1hr and 40 min. When we finally got our food, it was disgusting.

    "text": "I just came home from Dave and Busters in Glendale and I am really not happy and I want to share my experience.  We went there to celebrate my 9 year old nephew's birthday and there were 4 adults and 3 kids. We arrived at 3:30pm and were told we had to wait 45 mins for a table. This was a little surprising since we got there at such an odd hour, but it was fine. We used that time to play games on the floor.   This place is LOUD! My aspie son was overwhelmed a bit with the noise and the lights, so it might be something to consider when taking a child who has difficulties. Even the dining area is loud, so if you are planning to have an intimate conversation with someone, this is not the place.  When we were finally seated an hour later, we were greeted by the waitress right away. She took our drink and food order and everything was fine. But that's when things went south.  First off, I noticed that the table was a little sticky. I got something on my hand and had to wash up right away. But I figured once the plates arrived, it would cover up the stick, so I just let it go.  But then, it took at least 20 mins to get our food. I ordered the sirloin medium, and the second I tried to cut into it, I knew I was in trouble. I could barely cut the steak. It was so full of gristle! And it came with a side of loaded mashed potatoes. They were tasty, but unfortunately they were cold. This was an $18 meal, so I expected it to be good. I managed to eat about half the steak, but the rest I just gave up on. It was so tough, it was not edible.   I really didn't want to send the meal back because I was worried that someone would spit in my food. I'm not saying they do that here, I'm just saying I try to avoid doing things like that just in case.   Hubby ordered the rib/wing platter. He said the ribs were so full of fat and the wings were supposed to be jumbo. They were definitely not jumbo - they were barely regular. He also got a bowl of chili and he said that it was so small, he is thankful he didn't order the cup. It was definitely not worth $6.   We were seated right next to the wait staff area. There were about 4 or 5 servers there the entire time, all appearing to be just standing around and yapping. My SIL had to ask for ranch dressing 3 times before she got it. The servers were obviously not that busy, so we don't understand why it was so difficult to get a side of dressing.    Then we ordered desert. Hubby and I ordered the chocolate fondue, and the rest of the family got the donut holes.   We asked for extra plates so we could all share. The waitress came back with a stack of plates and every single one of them was dirty. I mean there was actually slimy stuff on them! I went through all of them as I passed them out, but every single plate had something stuck on it. I wasn't sure if they grabbed the wrong stack! I was so disgusted and I just couldn't hide it. The waitress asked if everything was okay, and I told her that all of the plates were dirty. So she went into the kitchen to get us some new ones.   Now correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't fondue supposed to be hot or at least warm? The chocolate fondue came served on top of a ceramic warming tray that I assumed was supposed to have a candle in it. But alas there was no candle, and the fondue was cold and watery. I still liked it and my son ate almost the entire thing. Maybe that warming tray is just for decoration.  The donut holes were actually really good and the best thing about the entire meal. The chocolate served with the donut holes was thicker than the chocolate fondue.   After the food, we went and played some more games for about 20 more minutes. I noticed that as we were leaving that they were just beginning to clean our table. No wonder we had to wait so long to be seated!   So overall, if you are looking for a fun, noisy place to drink and play games, it's totally fits the bill. But we will never eat here again. For the price of the food, we expected much better.",

We decided to visit Dave & busters.  My review is based on my visit only.  It could have had 5 stars, but these items would need to be improved upon:  *  One two playing card kiosks were working, the other's were out of order and no one made any attempt to fix them  *  The mountain of Nacho's had zero cheese at all!  *  The counters were a little dirty at the bar  *  The staff at the ticket redemption/gift shop need to be more attentive.  They were a little to busy talking to each other  *  The games need to be regularly checked for working conditions, many of them weren't working correctly (Needing several swipes of the card)  *  Maybe have floor staff, in the gaming area, walking around as hosts and greeters.  it was almost impossible to find anyone if you needed help with a game",

The event planner did not explain that the \"unlimited\" game cards I purchased for an extra $5 a kid did not work on all the games and right at 5pm we were kicked out of our table for another party- for the amount of $ I spent alone, plus the amount my guests spent on their tabs- was not worth the experience we had at Dave and Busters.

Not only did it take us thirty minutes of waiting by the bar waving anyone down, when we finally did, her expression said, \"I'm miserable and I don't want to be here\" and she had a terrible attitude. On top of that, she was very slow from start to finish; it probably took her fifteen minutes from the moment she took our ID's to finally getting the drink bill. Mind you, all of this without any sort of nice interaction. Also, the drinks were shitty. I just paid $11 for a Long Island Iced Tea filled with ice and barely any alcohol, if I'm paying $11 for a drink, it should at least be worth it. After playing games, we made the mistake of sitting down and eating as well. It was all just the same. Waitress with a bad attitude and not helpful when you asked her about the food (a friend asked if the wings were spicy because she does not like spicy food, waitress waved it off as \"not overly spicy\", when in fact they were too spicy and my friend could not eat them). The food also took forever to come out, and the waitress never asked us how our food was after we got it (which it wasn't bad, but it also wasn't good). Moral of the story: management needs to get their employees in line. Please eat and drink at any other restaurants at West Gate and only go to D&B's for the games, I know that's what I will be doing from now on.",

Meanwhile, people kept coming in looking around for a table. They weren't busy at all and there was staff standing around socializing and on their phones. A manager even went in to the bar area and that didn't seem to do any good either. Still messy, dirty tables...Food was very mediocre at best. The young lady that was our service was very sweet and did a great job handling our large party. She seemed to be the only one working.

I've never been to one either so thought it would be fun. We walked in and not one employee said hello. Although there was a guy at the front desk. We went to the bar area to look for a table and every single table on both sides of the bar were filthy dirty with cups, plates, and trash. Not one clean table. The place was dead. There was maybe 10 people in there. So it wasn't because they were busy. So we went to sit at the bar. Seat and bar were so sticky. No bartender in sight. We waited a few minutes but no one ever came. So we moved to the other side of the bar thinking maybe the bartender was over there. Sat down and nothing. So we looked for a table in a different section. All of the smaller tables in that section also dirty. I saw one employee standing there on his phone. A server passed us so I stopped her and asked if they could clean one table for us. She said it would be a min because she was the only server. I felt bad for her until she then disappeared never to return during the next 15 mins we waited. So we left. Very disappointing for my son and I. I won't be back.",

    "text": "This is my first time at this location and I was excited to go because it's closer to home and it was with my co-workers for a work gathering. The inside is well decor'd however what made it a 1 star rating is the service. My friends and I walked from the bar to the dining area where my other co-workers were and we accidentally walked in their station. We apologized and the female employee says, 'well don't do it again!' Wow, we knew after walking through it was their station. Human mistake and very rude. Next the waiter for our dining experience was great in the beginning but something seemed very odd. Our boss was with us and he was great when he was around; brown nosing him, saying 'whatever you want boss', 'you got it boss'. Until he left (our boss) is when he got bad..Two of us ordered drinks that paid cash, the rest paid with card. We both required change. My tab was $4.13 and I gave him $10.00. I think he was under the impression the change was his tip! When I asked my friend if she got her change after he brought back the others their cards back, she said no. I haven't also. I asked him where's  my change? He looked at me puzzled and says oh you got that drink? He say's what? I told him I gave you a $10 and my drink was $4.13, so where's my change? He thought for a second and say's oh don't worry I got you and proceeds to take out $5.00 from his pocket and tells my co-worker who ordered a Coors light that cost $3.99 that she has no change only 10 cents! So what! It's still money! And than he changes his story and says her beer was not $3.99 it's $4.99 so there's no change. She say's what so I owe you? How can that be, I bought beer at the bar for $3.99. He says oh, no your beer is not $3.99 it's $4.90 and the price is different at the bar than from the dinning. WTH?! Is this guy for real? She let it go because it was pennies to her. Oh not me! He forgot to bring 2 more silverware that we asked for earlier, he kept forgetting to bring the others drinks and when I asked, where's my 87 cents, AGAIN he looked puzzled. He says, oh I don't carry change??So...do the right thing! I want my receipt I said and he finally came back with is apologizing but it's too late now. It may be only 87 cents but that adds up and I bet he's sorry now for the terrible service because he would've got something but instead got nothing. I want to bring my family back I just don't know if we will dine because of the negative experience. This happened on December 18, 2015 and our servers name is JT.",

    "text": "Went there today with 4 adults and 1 child. Decided to eat before gaming. Took about 15 min for a server to come to the table and get our drink order. When they did, said 'oh sorry, a server hasn't shown up for their shift.'  Understanding that they are short handed, said no problem. However iced tea had no ice, chocolate milkshake was like chocolate milk... melted much?? Food was ok, most of it was cold, only got checked on once about 20 min after food was delivered, and drinks were empty, or melted. Finally, had to hunt down anyone working there, which ended up being a manager to get the check. She (the server that the manager had to find) brought it over immediately, but then continued to wait another 15 min for her to run the card.  I'm sorry, but if a guest has to get up and find somebody to bring a check, why wouldn't you be on top of that table and pick it up right away. I am \"in the biz\" as they say, and I don't complain much. But this was ridiculous!! Kudos to the hostess though. Excellent job. Won't ever dine there again!",

    "text": "So I'm glad I'm not off on seeing the horrible customer service here. Love bringing my son here to play games. But if you are planning on eating in or sitting at bar. Except horrible service. Went one day with family on Valentines day. Yes it was busy. We were walking around playing games w son. Decided to head to bar for couple beers and soda. Stood on one side waiting no service. Walked around found 2 empty seats. Ok now they will see us! Nope. Bartender down the way talking w customers glanced our way. Never came. After about 10 mins walked around to other side again. Stood for about 5 mins. By this time getting highly annoyed. Thing is there were plenty of people standing around that could of helped. Mean while i noticed a girl at a bar top storm off to get her own menu and complaining about the service. Finally manager asks if I need something. I told her she had the worst service behind the bar. And that I've been waiting over 15 mins. She apologized got our drinks. And did not charge us. We are now at our second visit to eat because we received a free entree coupon. Bartenders before even looking at coupon denied it. Then seemed annoyed taking it. Ugh. You think w all the complaints they would retrain in customer service.",

    "text": "Great place and location with an awful  staff and horrendous service. I expect D&B to be an electrifying fun place with a high energy, friendly staff, especially at its location in the Westgate entertainment district. I know this is a new location and maybe it was the pressure of a grand opening deadline that forced them to take anyone with a pulse to fill positions. We all hope the unqualified, non-customer service staff members are weeded out and replaced by quality, hardworking, friendly and honest individuals. JT was our waiter and he was terrible!! When you're in a profession that customarily rewards service with tips that reflect the level of quality, it's amazing that customer service is a problem. Many people are willing to pay for good service. A large part of the blame belongs to management. Lack of training, engagement and awareness of what's happening in their establishment is reflected on the staffs low-level performance. With the Westgate area build-up, service and hospitality will be the difference in the competition with the east valley.",

First let me say this Dave and Busters is really small compared to the other locations in Arizona...so me and my friends went in to get drinks and food on Friday night we ordered the tower beer 100 oz and the beer tasted watered down second the price on the food didn't match the quantity u get I ordered a 9.99 chicken quesadilla and got 5 mini slider looking quesadilla...our server Alex was a complete fuck up and he doesn't care about his job..he screwed up our order and the order of the people behind us...the people who brought out our food confirmed that when they had made a comment \"That dude (Alex) always fucks up, and now we're going to get blamed for it!\" Nice job Alex! He works in the bar area so maybe try and avoid that area altogether...seems I'm not the only one who has complained about this lazy POS ...next time I'll drive the extra 15 miles and go to the other Dave and Busters...Westgate Sucks!!",

We were seated and we waited and waited and waited. 25 minutes later my son in law went up to the hostess station to ask for a server. 5 minutes later a server comes over and puts down crumpled napkins. Takes our drink order and then says\" I will give this to your regular server I think it is Maria\". OK?? So then she returns about 5 minutes later with half our drinks the rest come a few minutes later. Then she comes back and says I guess I will be serving you. Appetizers were ok. Main entrees...LOL 2 come out we wait on 3 more. 1 entree the steak is well done and it was ordered medium. 10 minutes later 3rd entree shows up. 15 minutes after that the final entree arrives. I am stating actual time not we are hungry so 10 minutes becomes 30 time. These are real times. All the entrees were mediocre at best. I am being nice to say mediocre. The games were fine. The food and service in the restaurant need to be 100% overhauled. Service especially. Management take note.",

Then we walk over to bar area, every table had old food/plates etc. No one helped us, we finally went up to bar where 5 employees were standing, mentioned that we needed a table, 1 girl continued to gossip while passing immature dirty looks as if she knew us, finally 1 buser said I will clear a table and help you ladies. We had to patiently wait to be helped, took over an hour for us to place a drink then food order. No one checked on us and mean while tables were still disgusting, 2 customers complained about the same issue we were having, one customer threw a fit and walked out. Clearly they need more help and better etiquette. This was the worst experience my team has ever experinced.",

We finally made our to the dining area with no ones help and the 2 people working at the desk did not even greet you. The guy finally led us to a booth and we asked if we could have a different table away from the noise. The guy looked at us as if this would be too much trouble. As he was leading us to another table, we turned around and started to leave. As we were leaving, a girl at the front said have a nice day and come back soon. We then told her that the people in this place all seemed to have bad attitudes and have no skills on how to treat people. This place will never make it with employees like this.",

The agent on the phone advised me to call the store back and talk with a manager.  I called back to see if they could make a reservation for me and they told me NO even tho my party was going to be for 20 people and it was my wife's 30th birthday.  I asked to talked to a manager and the host Michael refused to get a manager on the phone.  Michael advised me that all his managers were busy because they were expecting a party of 100 people and each manager needed to handle the party.  He refused to get in touch with a manager and in my mind was lowsy customer service.  Will not be attending this place for a party or special event.  At least the Desertridge location was able to advise me that it was open seating on the lower level. If I could rate them half a star I would, customer service is what brings loyal customers and keeps the bills paid.",

Waited almost 2 hours for a table, yes we had a big party, but for such a big place and on a Saturday night they should have been more prepared. Then we ordered, drinks first then food, we waited 25 minutes for our drinks, when we asked why it was taking so long our server apologized and said they were behind in making the drinks, I said making them, half of them our coronas???!!!!! Next the food was all brought out 1 @ a time, my sister received her appetizer and entree all @ once, while the rest of us sat and waited. If it wasn't for our great company and for our families way of making fun of this service we were receiving, we never would have stayed, but we made it through, but will NOT be coming back!

Let me start off by saying that it was my boyfriend's 21st birthday, so we came with a party of about 10 people. We got there a bit late (9:45), but I had intended on eating and then playing games for about an hour. Well, let me tell you, that did not happen. Our server was very rude and treated my boyfriend as a child. I had to flag him down just to order some food, and above all, we sat there until closing time because of such slow service. Around 11pm, we had asked for our check multiple times, since we only had about an hour to play games, but our server was only interested in talking about his car to the guys (which is fine, however, in this case it interfered with his ability to do his job). By the time the tab was paid, it was already 11:45, so of course, we left. I was also pretty pissed about the fact that our server did not bother to even apologize for taking up all of our time. If I had wanted to just eat dinner, there are many other places I would have went to instead. I expected a lot better, especially considering that it was my boyfriend's special day. I definitely will not be back.",

So I politely asked if I can have a different drink (mind you I paid $10 for this drink of course I'm going to want to like it) she laughed & asked what else I wanted so I ordered something else. She then went to the people next to us (she knew them) & said \"I hate people\" obviously talking about me. I confronted her & also spoke to the manager who was apologetic but did nothing about it.

But after Saturday night visit around 11pm ish I just wasn't happy with the service. For one I get there with my guest and the bartender sees that we just got there  and doesn't even ACKNOWLEDGE. Instead he walks towards some other customers and started to have a conversation( you kidding me right, was it because I'm Mexican and they where white, because that's how you made me feel). Like seriously, anyways and to top it off the bar was dirty and NO you guys were NOT BUSY. So please Manager tell your bartenders to ACKNOWLEDGE every customer more and don't make them feel some type of way!!!!",

No one really greeted us or acknowledged us when we walked around looking for a table. Once we got seated one person came and told us she was only there to get our drink order but someone else was going to be our waiter. Our waitress came and took our order. We waited for a long time for our food but during the wait we were asked like 5 times by two servers if whatever they were bringing  out was our food???! Like these guys were on training or they did not know the numbered table system??! Finally our food came but they forgot my granddaughter's! So we asked our waitress she said she would check but didn't so I got up and asked someone that look like a manager and after a little while her food came. I get the place is busy but they do have a lot of servers. In a nutshell, long wait and mediocre customer service.",

We order the triple bacon burger cooked medium, which came out cooked all the way through and without the side of fries. When the fries finally came out they were stale and pretty cold for \"still being made\" when the burger came out. For the remainder of our dining we had to ask another server for water refills and another different server than our own for the check.

She did the best she could with what she had to work with.  The food was terrible. $130 down the drain. I would have enjoyed taking the money out of my bank and setting it on fire more than attempting to eat that food. You can tell it's all very old and been sitting in the freezer a good long while. The salmon was so over cooked I couldn't even chew it. The rice and salmon were both over seasoned so much it brought a tear to my eye. The pizza pull apart bread was so oily one child refused to eat anymore after one bite. The burger was so tough the other kid was unable to bite through it. The bang bang pasta was ok. Just ok. Very greasy and later made my son's stomach hurt. The steak was so tough my husband gave up after a few bites, and it was medium and tough. They offered not to charge me for the pizza pull apart but wouldn't waive anything else.   Most of the games were fun and I'll take he kids back. Some of them are broken though or have trouble reading the cards. It's mostly about going slow and leaving the card in for a second before pulling it out.   One thing is for sure... I will never eat there again. Also most of the tables were filthy and filled with dirty dishes. It was difficult finding a place to sit down that wasn't absolutely gross.",

    "text": "We came in to celebrate a friends birthday just after a concert and Gila River Arena and the service was sincerely horrendous. I'm super easy going after being in the business for over 16 years, I know places get busy and have off nights, but this was a whole other level of bad experience. We waited 30 minutes to get anyone to wait on us when a seemingly nice server came by as well as the manager and offered us some comp play for the time we waited. We ordered drinks and food and were totally content....until it took 15 more minutes to get drinks (water and soda), about 25 more minutes on top of that to get food. The server acknowledged that the birthday girls food was missing and said she would return with it. Now that in itself happens sometimes and is completely forgive able but what is NOT okay was how the server and manager handled the situation. The sever NEVER returned with the food even after 30 minutes of us asking every employee we saw for her or a manager to check on her food....Finally my boyfriend found the manager (who took forever to come to our table) and we told him about the issue in which he promptly put in a to go order for her and explained that the kitchen ran out of chicken and waffles that's why she never got it. That would be fine, had ANYONE come to check on the missing food or explain that the kitchen was out - seriously?? He then gave us two $10 gift certificates to use on the bill and doubled our play cards. When we sent our kid to go play while we handled the bill, over half the games were out of order. I told him we were still not satisfied as our entire time has now been spent trying to correct our meal and we literally didn't have time or the ability to play any games before closing. The server came back by and I told her we were not willing to pay for the play cards and that I feel the comp should be a little higher she agreed and apologized but also let me know that \"next time come in when it's not so busy and I swear you'll get better service\" ... thanks for the hot tip, which by the way was completely missing from the pen to sign our credit card slip with. Needless to say it's not always what happens but what you do after that counts the most, and trust me it counts to know they really don't care about their customers satisfaction at all.",

She was completely rude to us and rolled her eyes while we tried to explain why we had the empty cups in the 1st place and she walked away to attend to MEN instead of us ladies! Not classy at all.

(She is easy to spot as she is covered in tattoos! :] )  Not only is she friendly and talkative, but she is great at multi-tasking and very very attentive to everyone. Thank you Libby for the awesome service!",

    "text": "Some friends and I went there for a pre-grand opening VIP event. I'll start this review with a disclaimer. I KNOW this was a soft opening event and there are bugs (major) to work out. All food and beverages were comped and appropriate tips were left for the servers. Now to the review.... When invited to this invitation only event, I was offered 3 \"seating times\" for me and my 3 guests, 5:30, 6:30, and 7:30. We chose 7:30, assuming we would stay late and play games. No closing times were indicated in any of the promotional materials sent for the event. Upon arrival, the check in process was very quick and well organized. As soon as we went in (7:15) we requested a table for 6 (we met 2 other friends there) and were put on the waiting list. 2 of us sat at the bar while the others went off to play games. The bartenders were excellent, very attentive and were either experienced or very well trained. Kudos to them. It took 45 minutes to be called for our table. Understandable for a busy night. Here's where it fell apart. We placed our order for an appetizer.  and a round of drinks (we all received 2 free drink coupons. When our waitress brought our drinks, we placed our meal orders. 30 minutes later (8:30) there was an announcement that the VIP event would be ending in 30 minutes! Still no dinner.... The waitress apologized for dinner taking so long. Some of us then asked her for our 2nd drink, as they were waiting to use the 2nd drink coupon with dinner. \"Sorry, that announcement was Last Call so the bar is now closed.\" The manager then came over to apologize for the delay in our food and told us we could stay past 9:00 and enjoy our meal. I asked him if we could get our last round of drinks (just draft beer). He also said no, because the bar was closed, but we were brought waters. 15 minutes later, our dinner came, and so did our appetizer. We did ask our waitress earlier to check on our appetizer. I guess either she forgot or it still wasn't ready. A good thing we had the appetizer because they brought the wrong dinner for one of our guests, so he ate some of the boneless wings while waiting for the right dinner. It took another 15-20 minutes for his dinner to come out, as the rest of us had started our dessert. They brought his dinner out in a to-go box instead of on a plate, so he opened his to-go box and ate his dinner. We saved him a few bites of dessert. We were the 2nd to last group to leave. All the employees were lined up at the door clapping for everyone as they left. I actually had the feeling at that point they were clapping because they were happy to see us leave!  Will I be back? Doubt it. I'm at Westgate for every home Coyotes game. Their Happy Hour prices are not competitive with places in Westgate such as Buffalo Wild Wings. The manager's poor accommodations left a bad taste in my mouth. If he would have, at least, offered us a free beer on a return visit (since we couldn't use our last drink coupon), I might have been more likely to try the place again before a Coyotes game.",

    "text": "It's good to know that this place is terrible no matter which state you are in. We are visiting from Las Vegas and staying nearby. With the Las Vegas Golden Knights in the Stanley Cup finals, what a better place to watch the game... or so we thought.   First, it's a great place for families. The games are fun and the kids have a good time. Unfortunately the food is only one level above chuck-e-cheese (but for adults). Drinks are expensive and are often poured short. Your best bet is to order beer; hard to mess that up.   I think what disappoints me the most is the service. Listen, I'm all for giving young adults a chance to earn a decent living, but the kids here are lazy. Most stand around and only help when you ask.  We watched the entire game here and ordered food towards the end of the first period. It was okay... But the table was left in-bussed for a good 40 minutes after completing our meals and drinks. A guy came by the host stand with a buss cart and left it there... So I took it upon myself to buss our table. Not one server offered to help as they stood silently and watched. Unbelievable!  Then, sitting at an empty table for the remainder of the third period, no one came buy to see how we were doing. We would have gladly ordered more overpriced drinks, but instead when the game was over, we asked for our check and took our business elsewhere.  The only plus was the one person who was able to get the game on for us... Thanks",

After that disappointment I went to the other side and was seated at a spacious table. The server was nice and sweet, but when we got the food it honestly wasn't that good. The grilled wings were delicious but the sweet and sour sauce tasted generic. The food can be brought out fresher and the reason I knew it was sitting out was because the cheese was very dry. But overall we have a great experience in the arcade area",

I said 2 of us are and she said \"you have to be over 18 to be in the building\" and I asked since when? And this girl comes back with \"since forever, if you'd like to read our rules it's right there\" . Like excuse me but I have definitely had people younger than 18 go in there. It's fine that that's the rule, but she said that's the rule because they sell alcohol but correct me if I'm wrong but last time I checked you have to be 21 to drink so that didn't make sense. Anyway the staff was really rude and had so much attitude. So we left and went to main event.",

    "text": "Met my family here for lunch before catching a spring training game. Two people ordered the chicken salad but it was delivered WITHOUT chicken. When it was pointed out to the waitress she insisted it was in there, \"um no, that's cabbage\". She finally succumbed and agreed to return them to the kitchen.  I ordered lettuce wraps which came out MISSING the dressing. I chose not to say anything because of the attitude with the chicken.  Later, when taking my first bite of soup I found a HAIR dangling from my spoon.   The thing that really bothered me was the response we received. Everything was just blown off without an apology of any kind! Our party was highly disappointed and living in an area with SO many other great choices... there are NO plans to return!",

    "text": "Dear Bri, there is a reason that you didn't recieve a tip and there is a reason that we didn't pay our bill. That reason was you. First off you need to listen and make sure you understand what is being order. Also helps if you have a basic understanding of the menu. Now here is the next important thing before you bring drinks to my table please  make sure we have recieved our silverware. I had to ask another server after i asked you to get us some napkins and silverware. Which you brought to the table next to us. Also if a customer orders a steak well done make sure they cook the steak on the grill till its well done. Not just medium amd then microwave it the rest of the way and hope it gets there. You are quality control for the kitchen. Because you work off tips you need to make sure you tables food is the best even if you have to refuse to take something out till its right. So I hope last night was a good learning experience. The ribs amd grilled chicken were dried out as well. Normally I have a great time here. Next time we will go eat at chipotle then come play games. At least there I will expect the terrible service and sub par food.  The games were fun.",

I ordered my steak that comes on it medium rare, it came out almost well done!  The only piece in the middle had some pink.  The other thing we ordered was buffalo wings, they came out with the main entree and was very cold. I asked the server if she could take it back to heat it up for us. She said yes , then took two orders at two different tables. When she can back to get the wings, she explained she had to put in another order because they couldn't take food back into the kitchen. As we had already waited 20 mins for the first order, I elected not to take the wings.",

I enjoy coming here with my friends and playing the games. They have all of the latest arcade titles and they are all in brand new condition. If you want to get more games for your buck, come on Wednesdays. The games are half priced so you get more play time for your money. One thing that kind of sucks is the parking on certain days. When there is a coyotes game or an even at the arena, forget about parking. We always have to park at the Tanger Outlets and walk all the way to D&B, otherwise you have to pay $15 to park on one of the lots. However, I enjoy this location more than the Tempe or Desert Ridge Marketplace locations.",

We stood next to an open high top waiting for it to be cleared and wiped down for nearly ten minutes. Then once we were seated, we waited another 15 to have our server take our order. The food was brought out by the kitchen and we had split a sandwich. After the sandwich was delivered, we waited another close to five minutes to get silverware. We ended up just going to the bar and asking for silverware ourselves. When the server checked on our food, we asked for a plate since we were splitting and a ranch. My husband ended up eating his half of the sandwich over his napkin at the table because we were never brought a plate. Server came back to table with the ranch after all of our food was gone and we were done. So many other great dining experiences in WESTGATE, I would not recommend dining here again, the gaming experience was great but they need to step up their customer service game big time.",

    "text": "My family visited this Glendale location on October 26th for the first and the LAST time. The location had two staff members attending to three tables if you could even say that because the young waitress was the only one we saw actually working while the other waiter by the name of Jeff, tall guy, was too busy mingling with other workers to do anything else. We were there as a group for a child's birthday and we wanted to order some food so we attempted to waive \"Jeff\" down but he proceeded to ROLL HIS EYES, TURN AROUND AND WALK IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. The young woman finally came over and took our order. Unfortunately everyone, except my father, received their order. FIFTY-FIVE minutes later everyone finished eating and still my fathers food was missing. Once again we waved down the waitress and she told us it had to be remade because it had been left out and gotten cold since no staff member had delivered it to our table. This whole time Jeff looked to be having a great time playing around with his coworkers as he ignored our group.  After complaining to the manager, who as it turns out was one of the people too busy mingling with Jeff to do their job, they didn't charge my father for his food but they charged him for things like tokens and macaroni we didn't even order. Too frustrated to complain to a manager that can't \"manage\" his staff much less this location we paid and left. We will make sure to spread the bad word of the disrespect and lack of service Dave & Busters at Glendale offers.",

Any establishment with arcade games is going to be a little on the noisy side, but this was truly sensory overload from the time you walked in.   Right inside the front doors is an appealing, but overpowering perfume-like scent.  I wasn't sure if it was a classy air freshener or a hostess bathed in perfume before her shift, but whatever it was, it was too much.  There were lights flashing everywhere, music blaring.   It was like being at a rave, but the only mushrooms were of the portabella variety.  Basically, it's as if D & B's is realizing their target demographic has shifted and now consists of adults who were raised having parties with talking rats and crappy pizza and stinky ball pits.   They need more sensory stimulation.  I get it.     The food was overpriced but decent.   I had the roasted veggie sandwich and it was a little greasy, but good.     The kids enjoyed the play area and I enjoyed schooling them at skee ball, so all was not lost.   They were a little disappointed that their game room \"earnings\" netted exactly one sticky hand and a small package of gummy bears.   Life is hard, kids.",

People were standing near the table like vultures waiting for us to leave.  The food was nothing more than glorified fair food, and very expensive.  We ordered a Philly Steak sandwich, which was soggy and dry, the Hottie burger which had no flavor and over cooked, steak which was also over cooked, and rib and mac and cheese sandwich which was also flavorless, two beers a glass of wine, mojito, and two iced teas for a total of $104 (without the tip). I much rather go to Uptown Alley and will never return to Dave and Busters, or recommend it to anyone.",

What really threw me off was that most of our orders took about more than an hour to get to our table. One of my friends didn't get his until another 25 minutes after we were done eating. The second time I went to this place it was just me and my boyfriend on a Wednesday night,which was not that crowded. They gave us a buzzer and told us it would be 10 min to seat us, yet there was more than 15 tables open. She was just talking to a waitress and sat us when she was done talking. She sat us at a big round table which had 8 seats which was odd because there were booths open. Then nobody came to asks what drinks we wanted and there was just a lot of workers just messing around as if they didn't have a job. After 15 minutes we left.",

She called and asked if she would have to leave and come back in. She was told by the manager that they don't make people leave unless they are disruptive. They arrived about 10 pm. They order food, play some games. They tell the server they are there to celebrate her 21. At midnight she orders a drink. The server takes her I'D and shows it to the mgr. He tells her he can't serve her until aftet 8 am. WHY? If that was truly.the policy they had so many times someone could have said something...on the phone, when she arrived wearing her \"I'm 21\" button, when they told the server...and the excuse you have them makes no sense at all. So-we were there frequently to celebrate all kinds of things but no more. This was just all kinds of ridiculous.",

Food comes in a shortish wait from another staff member.   Kid asks for ranch.  Ranch never comes.  Kid doesnt touch his food. Gives up and  heads to the arcade.  Getting full on upset.  Kids food now cold.  Lots of staff walking by.  No eye contact, wont stop.   Can we get some ranch.  Too late, kid is done, i am too walk to the front to find Jose.  He is getting a new table waters obviously forgot about us or does not care. Can i get this to go and my check?  Yes.  Never see Jose again. After 20 min.  I need to find my kid.  Terrible, terrible service.  The kid cant play any games anyway as the place is packed and obnoxious.   I will never visit one again, they are just not a good experience anymore wherever you go.",

Not 30 minutes after ordering.  Was gonna do food,  but couldn't bring myself to spend $17 on appetizers and $20+ on entrees to get them 45+ minutes later.  The staff was friendly enough,  but I don't think they staff according to their volume.  The slow service isn't the servers fault, but I bet their tips suffer here.  I spent $42 on a round of drinks and left $10 tip but no way was I going to suffer through dinner service experiencing that.  We went to Mama Ginas and got served fast and the food was good an inexpensive.  That said,  eat before you come here,  get a couple sodas and hit the games.",

Waited 10 mins and no one spoke to us and even the bartender saw is but she just ignored us. I also tried signing up for their rewards program online and the site does not work properly.

It was around 3 pm and it was only half as busy as the first time we went, there were at least 4-6 empty booths in the restaurant and we were still quoted a 2 hour wait. I can understand that for the huge table in the middle that was reserved for a party, but not having all those tables sitting empty while people are standing there waiting. Seems very much like a ploy to get you to play games while you wait, but we just left. Might give them one more typical down the road but if it's just like the first two times we'll be done with them.",

The food was absolutely terrible. I had a burger which I ordered cooked to medium. It ended up being well done and super dry. My fries were salty they were just inedible. My husband had some regular wings, the sauce was decent but the wings had no crispness to them. So they were basically heated in a microwave. The other couple ordered the nachos, and were also disappointed with the meat sauce on top. Westgate has some great restaurants I literally could have eaten any where else and enjoyed my meal.

Thankfully, we'd gotten a Groupon deal and it was worth the money, but if we'd paid full price, I'd have been gobsmacked.  Many of the games are in need of servicing or retirement. I encountered one game where the joystick didn't work, making it a total frustration. One of the basketball hoops I used had deflated and torn balls. Another game crashed in the middle of play and showed a Windows error. Employees are nowhere to be found on the game floor to report these issues.  We sat down at the bar for Happy Hour. The large bar was being ran by a single bartender and the service was frankly awful. We ordered a soda, a beer and 2 appetizers off the \"Bar Bites\" menu. The drinks took 10 minutes. The food came 10 minutes after, with the check. Then we sat around for nearly 20 minutes waiting for the bartender to come back and take the payment. The food was not good, at all. I ordered chips & guacamole, which was browning and really lacking flavor. My husband's pretzels were visibility soggy. I had very low expectations for the bar snacks and even those were not met.  Overall, we had fun with the machines that did work. We would go again if we had another Groupon, but there's no way I'd pay full price for bad  service and broken games.",

We spent close to $100 and had fun playing. We enjoyed the variety of games and felt that we made out pretty fairly good tickets wise. However, the dinner part of the trip was not up to par. I had to first track down an employee just to ask if we were able to sit down anywhere, or if we had to wait to be seated. I was told it was open seating and a server would find us. We sat close to the bar, but unfortunately, we spent about 15 minutes at the table and not one server even came our way.   We decided to get up to go someplace else to eat instead. But first we went to go claim some prizes from our winnings. We walked past the bar and found all the employees standing around talking to each other. Mind you, it was still fairly early in the evening, and the restaurant side was pretty quite but I feel that they could have better kept an eye out for those who were there to eat. Bummed because we all had our minds made on what to eat and experienced nothing great.",

We have two toddlers aged 3 & 2. We expect them to be rowdy at dinner and the volume at D & B is actually perfect. There were A LOT of children there so I was surprised that they didn't have: lids for ANY cups, color changing straws (AS advertised for the drinks we ordered- I really wish our server would have told us this as we ordered the slushees for the kids), small plates or smaller silverware for small mouths.  I'm not going to complain about the time the food took, I totally understood we chose to go out on a Saturday night.  All the food is brought out accept for my moms ribs. That's fine. We ask about it and 5 minutes later it comes out. Our server explains that the plate is VERY hot and proceeds to hands it to my my mom. My mom panics and drops the plate down as she burned her hands. I really wish she would have: handed my mom a napkin to take the plate (there were none on our table), set the plate down and slide it over or maybe put it on a plate that wasn't scalding.  This part made me the most upset. We receive our bill for $26 & give our credit card. When we receive the card back with the receipt, it states that the card was ran for $56. I ask the server and she leaves for 10 minutes to ask about it. When returning she said that nope, that a mistake and it was only ran for the $26. Checking our bank determined that it WAS ran for the $56. Look, I don't care that a mistake was made but please tell me the truth. Tell me it was ran for the $56 & then refunded.   TLDR: This Dave and Busters is in need of some TLC. Oh & double check your receipts / bank statements.",

Every where is clean & fresh. There's a wing eating competition right now which is cute as all heck cause it's kids. I used to go to Head Quarters, but this year I'll stick to D&B. Classier crowd & excellent service. & only a few cowboy fans thankfully lol jk.",

    "text": "Dave & Busters is an arcade/bar/restaurant that is friendly for all ages. I come to these frequently and especially on Wednesday's for the half priced games. These places have become more and more expensive over the years for games and food which is a little upsetting. They are fun to hangout at though with friends and family.   FOOD: I haven't eaten at a D&B for years now, but I know that they always have had some good food and at decent prices. Their pastas always look great and so do their appetizers. Their drinks are decently priced. I had a Bloody Mary here that was spicy and delicious. This drink was $10 (no surprise).   SERVICE: Their staff is always friendly. Their game attendants are helpful if something went wrong. Their bartenders tend to seem overwhelmed a lot though which is odd because half the time, the bar isn't extremely busy. I haven't had a bad experience with the staff though.   OVERALL: Dave & Busters is a fun place to hangout and win some games if you've got some skill! Their Wednesday specials are nice, and I always look forward to a good time here.",

We sat in the dining area to eat before going to play games. We actually never even got to the games because we left 20 minutes into our visit. Why did we leave so quickly? Well, we sat and waited those 20 minutes just for no one to greet us, take our drink order or even walk by our table. That is completely unacceptable. We decided not to stick around and ended up driving over to the Desert Ridge location instead, even though this location is 10 minutes from our house. This was the first and only time we've been here, and we don't plan on visiting again. I've had friends with similar experiences, and we always make sure to tell others to steer clear since your location apparently can't get it together.",

Not enough wait staff.    No refills on drinks or all you can eat wings.       It was horrible.  10 other families sitting around us experiencing the same.  We spent 150 dollars plus that day.

    "text": "Upbeat and fun! I was looking for a fun place to spend time with my teenage son. We had outgrown some of the other amusement joints like PPP and Chuck E. Cheese's.   The WELCOME: D&B's a grown up version of the food and arcade business. It has a nice bar, happening arcade that almost looks like a casino and wide range of prizes.  Not So Cool #1: Inattentive hostesses did not direct us to where we were supposed to sit to eat. So we ended up seating ourselves where they were having a private birthday party and getting stared down.  The NOSH: We sat down and ordered one of the play and eat combos. Son ended with with a delicious medium well thick burger with well seasoned fries. \"Better than McDonald's fries!\" High praise from my son who loves fries. We got a great deal for credits on our Power Card. $18 for 120 credits.  Because it was Sunday, I got the Huddle Nachos for $5. The beefy nacho sauce, jalapenos, delicious fresh guacamole, sour cream, black beans and diced tomatoes were a winning combination over warm chips.   Not So Cool #2: The kitchen did not put enough sauce to chip ratio. However our server remedied it by bringing nice and warm extra sauce to finish my chips with. Way to go!  The GAMEPLAY: Everything looked so inviting. We were particularly attracted to the Luigi Mansion ghost-vacuuming game and Big Buck Hunter. We also played Jurassic Park which was very exciting. The best value for play was Big Buck Hunter: 3 Trek single player was 6.8 credits. We had a blast for a long time with that game. Luigi's Mansion was fun but you had to be good at it in order to play longer, same with Jurassic Park.  Not So Cool #3: 1 out of 2 Big Buck Hunter Machines were out of order. The Luigi Mansion and Jurassic Park cabins were littered with candy wrappers.  The Amenities: I had to visit the washroom.  Not So Cool #4: The ladies' bathroom was out of soap on one side of the bathroom, and I had to move to the other set of sinks. The toilets also stank of a combination of urine and cleaner fluid.  Overall, we had a great time. We signed up for their Rewards Program and will be back to play Big Buck Hunter. Maybe this might be a Sunday tradition.",

We ordered nothing complicated and 4 of us including the birthday girl ordered the Sunday special of wings.  Everyone was served about 30 min later, except those who ordered the special of the day.  The food that was served was incorrect and it undercooked.  We were given no utensils, napkins( had to ask another server for them), no condiments (had to ask yet another server for them). 40 minutes later I went and requested a manager since 4 of us still hadn't been served, he came over said he'd get food out to them.  We waited.. and waited.. our actual server came by a couple times to let us know she had no clue what was going on.  Food finally came out and wouldn't you know it, they forgot the birthday girls order..another 15  min later after the manager comes back we let him know that she still hadn't been served and how frustrated we were.  His response.. what do you want me to do about it?!  We responded \"get our kid the food she ordered!\"  And in jest we said and we want all of this for free.  He looked at us for a minute said he could do that and disappeared.  Our kid eventually got her food, we never saw another server for the hour we sat there watching the end of the football game.  No apologies, no clearing of plates, no water nada.  Game over, we got up and walked out.",

The only thing that I did not like what's the wait at the door to grab a table but after finding a seat at the bar me and my girls were still not informed once our table was ready so we just dined at bar. I will be back to others closer to my hometown in Alabama to get in on the playime..",

The place wasn't busy at all and after we sat down we waited about 15 min and then my wife had to go find someone to get our order taken. Then it took about another 20-30 min and we mainly had appetizers. Didn't get refills on the drinks. The waitress had no clue what beers were on special. After we were done eating it took another 10-15 min to get the check. Would've had better food and service going to McDonald's.",

We were told it would be about 20 minutes to get a seat in the nearly empty dining room but the bar is open seating. We went with open seating. 15 minutes before the waiter came over to take our drink order. We ordered our drinks and food at the same time 1:50 pm. Our food came out 2:45 pm. The sandwiches were warm the fries were room temp and soggy like they sat for a long time. The burger was forgotten. The salad was pathetic and wilted and the soup was lukewarm. We were assured the burger was coming right out. 10 minutes later it did. I sent my soup back because I like hot soup. The manager brought it back and I asked if it was hot this time. He said well they just took it out of the pot. It wasn't hot but it was better than the first one. Honestly the waiter couldn't have been nicer. He was attentive and he was really busy. The management and the rest of the staff left little to be desired. And yes, they charged me for everything. I spoke to the waiter and he went and found a manager and had the soup removed. Kudos to the waiter but a big thumbs down to the rest of the staff. I don't think I will be going back.",

I get it, no outside drinks, I wasn't even upset about that because, trust me here..I had full intentions on purchasing an overpriced beer. I was upset about how rude the girl was. As for everything else, I would say this place is overrated, but looking at the reviews here (which is something I should have done first) this place does not appear to be rated highly anyways. The service was slow, even on a slow Thursday night and food was mediocre at best. Typical bar food, but my suggestion would be to eat at Buffalo Wild Wings before eating here to play games, if thats the type of food you are looking for. As I said, this was my first time to this place and I can tell you it will for sure be my last. LOTS of improvements all the way around need to be made.",

I called ahead to reserve a table because on the site when you look them up says that is allowed. But when I called a young women answered and said they do not take reservations at all. So I thought to myself wells that's odd. So I then asked what the wait was then and she said about 20-30 minutes. Okay awesome that's fine.  So we left home finally got there 5 minutes later. (Literally) because we live right be hind west gate. Super close. We then asked for a seat and she then said the wait was an hour and a half. Humm. Not what you just told me. And so I told her I just called and she said no one got a call regarding wait time and reservations. So then that frustrated me because you are clearly lying.   That is the main reason why this place is only getting three stars because how rude and how much mean attitude these ladies had.  As for our server Ryan who likes water sports and food. Everything else was fantastic, just really packed with tons of kids and such. But that's okay. We still had fun.   Just watch out for those from desk hosts. Rude as hell. Won't be back for awhile to this location. Tempe will still be my goto.",

He came out got us seated, talked to us and then was our server until our server was able to get to us. He apologized numerous times and came back numerous times to check on us. He made our dining experience extremely pleasant. A million thanks to him!!  Every time we come we have to wait for someone to show up and seat us. Today we waited a few minutes and finally a girl came to ask us how many. She told us the wait would about 15 minutes. We wait 35 minutes and go to the counter to ask again. Then another woman tells us that they actually said 20-30 minutes. She wasn't even there when we made the request. Naturally I'm very upset because she was rude and we've waited all this time. She tells us we are next. We have currently waited 50 minutes for an originally 15 minutes wait time, then turned 20-30 minutes. We would leave but we've already purchased the game cards. Who knows how much longer we will wait to be seated to eat, hopefully sometime today!!",

Knowing also that it was not my demographic, I attended a corporate event that was held in a separate room that was far from sound-proof. The food that was served was unidentifiable.

He notified the front desk. We were impressed by how quickly they reacted. The tall, Caucasian manager and the staff showed concern and got a description of what he was wearing and how he looked like. They reacted and communicated quickly over the walkie. They had three staff members at the door. We finally found him after what we felt like eternity, but again I felt comfort knowing that they blocked off the entrances and were also keeping an eye out for him. A+++ work and I highly recommend this place. All staff are very hard working and great customer service. No matter how crowded and busy the place was-they we're very efficient at helping us during such a stressful time.",

We were playing pool and the booths we were sitting at had all their bus tubs full of roll-ups and dishes. 15 minutes had pass and not one server came to ask for our drink order. We had to flag someone down, who was not so happy that we asked for service. It took over 20 minutes to get our drinks,  which we got AFTER  we had just given up and went to the bar to get our own. We finished our drinks and decided to leave. Not a good time at all. Rather drive a little further to go to the one in Tempe.",

First off they wait forever to clean up unused tables and when they finally do they do no place silverware so when our food finally came out we had to wait until our very slow server got around to it. While ordering my husband asked her for a side of ranch, she didn't bring it with our meals so my husband asked her again. She brought it when we were done eating!! My son wanted dessert which she brought without a spoon again had to wait until she got around to it. I understand it's a busy place and there are tons of people you are taking care of but when we are waiting on you to do your job and you are sitting there chit chatting for up to 15 mins at a time without checking your tables that is a huge problem!!! The servers have attitude and overall suck at their job! We will not be returning to this location!!!",

I'll just list all of this  short and sweet because that is all that matters.   1.  I ordered a beer and it probably took about 15 minutes to get me my drink and it was not  even that busy.  2:  The server was great and was very attentive.  Much thanks to her. 3.  The food was horrible.  The food was gross and overpriced.  My \" hottie\" burger showed up severely under cooked and the bun was sopped in grease.  The rest of the party agreed that their food was either extremely bland or greasy and gross.    If you want to go to an arcade then go to an arcade to play games.  Do not go to an arcade and consider the great idea that a $12 burger might be worth it.  Would not recommend for food and or drink.  Will not return.",

The setting was different From the Dave and busters in Tempe. As expected you know it's going to come with some hiccups because of its grand opening. However, the food was pretty good and it did take a while for it to come out, but it wasn't bad service.

    "text": "Came here today with my son around 3pm since I seen yelp had a $20 free play with $20 purchase. We ordered a kids cheeseburger, chicken quesadilla, and bar burgers. Food came out and it was a cheeseburger quesadilla, bar burgers, and chicken quesadillas. The manager apologized and said he would get a kids cheeseburger going. I was able to finish my meal before my son go his. The waiter said he was sorry a few times and that he tried to get the manager to remove the charge for it since it took a while but he said his manager said no that it wasn't long even though it was long enough for me to finish my food. Pretty sad when a waiter does the right thing for customers before a manager. Perhaps they need to switch positions. Paid and went to front desk to redeem my coupon. Short girl at from said my coupon was not valid because it didn't come from D&B members email. I told her it was from yelp and I have used yelp offers before. She said this was a screenshot and it was a scam. I just said ok and walked away. I read further in the small print and it stated D&B was the issuer and just present to front desk. I went back and she still kept disagreeing that it was directly through D&B she then had an attitude and called the manager. He looked at the coupon and said no they don't do business with yelp and this was not valid. I kept telling him it was through D&B you can obviously tell. He said he would type in the codes but it wouldn't work. And what do you know it worked. They gave no apologies. I used to love going to D&B but this place is horrible now. Expensive, prizes are ridiculous amount of tickets needed. Games never work , food is disgusting. We used to go every Wednesday for years but now they treat you like you are trying to scam them. Won't be back for a long time if ever again.",

The bar is pretty awesome.  The bartenders Zel and Ryan are freaking awesome. It took them a while to get to me on a Friday night but that's okay. I understand it was peak business time. Their amazing social skills made up for the wait. Haha Ryan made my drinks and they were freaking BOMB! Yummy yum yum! He also has some sweet flipping skills.   LETS TALK FOOD The loaded tater tots were pretty good. The Mac and cheese is the bomb diggity. I've tried the pretzel pull apart thingy and that was really stale. Each time I've been there, the wait was a little long whether it was waiting for the food or waiting for service.  The only things I wish I could change is that I wish it were bigger. More room for more games/activities and more room for breathing! Also, less wait time and more awareness would be cool lol  EL FIN!",

Fries were soggy, greasy, and barely edible. Beer was warm and flat, as if the chillers were off-line (again). As far as atmosphere and overall ambience, visitors from out-of-town receive a cool reception from the staff and beady-eyed regulars. The bar , counter top, floor and fixtures were in dire need of cleaning, possibly even fumigation. Noisy kids are all over the place...more like a circus than a sports bar.",

    "text": "Dear Customer Service,   First of all, you should know that I'm typing this with my middle finger...  So when my gal-pal chose Dave & Buster's for tonight's activities, I was a bit hesitant only because I saw the star-rating here on Yelp.  But hey, I've been to the Tempe Marketplace location before and it wasn't bad so I assumed this one would garner the same experience.  Boy was I wrong --- such a low-rating and for good reason!  These Yelpers are on the ball with their reviews!  When Jannette L. and I first walked in, we stood at the \"Eat\" counter for a solid two minutes before anyone came over to seat us.  After being seated, no menus were given so we ended up swiping some off a neighboring table.  I wasn't even mad.  We browsed for a quick minute and suddenly our waiter came by to take our orders, not even realizing where the hell we got our menus.  After telling him we weren't ready, I got a surprise \"gift.\"  In comes Tran D., the missing link to our bestie trio --- SHE'S MOVING BACK!  Lots of hugs, squealing, and chaos ensued.  Anyways, we browsed the menu and orders were placed.  I got the Baked Chicken & Shrimp Alfredo [Originally $18.99 but I did the double-up thing to get the $20 Power Card for $26.99] and Jannette and Tran got the Bistro Steak & Shrimp with Lobster Alfredo [Originally $21.99 but they did the double-up thing to get the $20 Power Card for $29.99].  We ate, service was pretty sparse, but we had a decent meal.  My dish was pretty decent, although pricey, and Jannette and Tran seemingly enjoyed theirs minus the steak being cooked nearly well-done when they ordered it medium rare.  So after tax and tip, we paid about $40 each.  We had leftovers and had asked if they can hold it for us while we played some games.  Little did we know, we'd never see our to-go boxes again...  The night was a blur of games, tickets, and prizes.  Come time to grab our leftovers, the security guard completely ignored us when we inquired about it [hey, you could just tell us to wait for an actual server or staff --- we only asked you because no one was around] and we wandered to the bar to find some staffers but they all ran away since apparently closing time of midnight means they have the right to ignore us.  A gentleman, the ONLY staff member who was nice, named Steve eventually came by and looked at the host stand and the front desk.  He told us the cleaning staff probably already came by and tossed away our leftovers but if we came back, to let them know that Steve wants us three to get $10 play credits each for the mishap.  Le sigh...  I really wanted to eat my pasta!  All in all, with the exception of Steve, it was a night of horrible service --- from bar staff sitting on counters to flirt with girls to our waiter who can't even give us silverware [a different waiter gave us silverware], let alone get us a refill for our drinks.  Little things like that adds up to be quite problematic.  So yah, eff you too, D&B.  I'll be back only because I have like 2,300+ tickets on my card but for food?  Who knows.  They serve a decent meal, a bit pricey for the quality, but the service sucks!",

The  food was 7 out of 10, it wasn't bad but for \"arcade/snack bar food\" it's was pretty alright, still pricey though for the quality they are. I'd say their dishes range from $15-$20. I honestly don't have very many complaints aside from the sucky non-existent service. It took forever for them to take bills and when we went to the bar for glasses of water. No, not the process but it took so long for them to even greet us. After we ate, we each got a to-go box for our meals. We didn't want to lug them around so we asked our waiter to hold them for us, he said certainly and we even wrote our names on our boxes, but when we went to retrieve them, they were no where to be found. \"The cleaning crew probably picked them up\" wait, even with our names on them? Even though you're a restaurant, and you should be familiar with your own carry out boxes? When we went looking for the front desk to swap cards and retrieve our leftovers, we spoke aloud, but were left confused even with security there, he didn't even try to direct is elsewhere or to let anyone know we were at the counter.  Also, this was a very slow, watching grass grow Monday night. Minimal people were there tonight, I couldn't imagine what the service is like on busy weekend nights.  If it weren't for Steve, who tried to offer to fix things next time, I'd probably not give this place a second look.",

I ordered the lettuce wraps and they were delicious! Best ever!",

    "text": "I really enjoyed my visit to Dave & Buster's. My waitress was polite and my food (philly cheesesteak) was delicious. The games as always were great and even with it being a Friday night, I didn't find myself having to wait to play a game without an easy opportunity being open. Though I've been to D&B before, this was my first time at this location and it held up to my expectations.",

    "text": "I don't know about many others but I personally love this place. Especially now that they have the power card menu options. I love it because my family has a great time here. We fight over the last credits on the power cards, leave with great souvenirs and full bellys. I was so sick of the usual Peter Piper Pizza scene for food and games with the fam. And this place has opened up a new door for me and my fam wit their updated menu. Wednesday's are our favorite cuz it's 1/2 priced games all night. And the food is so Delish! Huge variety and large portions to make sure you get your money's worth. As for me and my family, we love this place.",

    "text": "I was told by the staff at the front counter to use the app because I could use a buy $20 get $20 chips coupon. I proceeded to purchase the $20 order of chips and received a notification that said the app charged me $20 but could not deliver the chips into the account due to an error. I talked to the manager and he told me that there was nothing he could do about the error. I mentioned that I was told to use the app to get the coupon and he did not care to help in the slightest. I went outside to call the D&B support to get a refund but there was no number to call so I went back inside to demand a refund or a chip transfer into my account. The manager said he could not use the coupon because they do not have it in the system so he could not give me the chips I paid for. I went back outside, found the coupon online, and went back inside to show the manager that I have a coupon with a barcode. He then proceeded to help an employee load the chips into my card, and gave me the chips I originally purchased without receiving. HOWEVER, HE DID NOT SCAN MY COUPON. This means that when he told me that he could not honor the coupon on the app because it did not exist in the system, he lied to my face. This is shameful. It took me about half an hour to get the chips I paid for and not only did the manager not want to help, but he even lied to my face about not being able to give me the chips that I paid for. I have never written a negative review on Yelp before, but this is the worst behavior I have ever seen from a manager at any business. I will be surprised if I ever support this D&B location again.",

The food was great. We really enjoyed the Buffalo Chicken Sliders, the loaded tots, and the chicken fingers. The games were great too just too expensive.",

I decided to complain about the fries so they took them back and came right back with a few warm fries on top. Server is in need of training. I find it ridiculous that a server is unable to answer questions about food on the menu. Eating prior to coming here is an absolute must!",
