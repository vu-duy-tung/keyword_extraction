The food was great, not too greasy and my coffee was bottomless due to the attentive, but not annoying, server!  I will definitely be returning. I was telling my boyfriend that 5th Avenue Cafe is our new breakfast joint! We actually left something of value that accidentally was tossed and when we called, they had the dishwasher look through the garbage and it was found!!!!!!! We even told them they could just put the bag outside and we would go through it ourselves.  Thank you thank you!!!! Very kind folks and great food to boot!",

The good news is that the food is almost as good as the service. Big portions, food comes normal/fast (never late). 3. They could be at a better location and update the furniture.   If this place goes with a \"country/farmy\" look and style it will hit the jackpot!",

My food was covered in an ocean of grease and oil, the coffee taste 3 days old and when I tried to ask the waitress for a side of fruit instead of my greasy heart attack hash browns she gathered with all her colleagues and talk about us like dogs (Pointing and staring). Don't let longevity fool you. The food is terrible and service is worse. Your better off going to the grocery store and making your own breakfast. Seriously don't know how this place is open and with an 4 star ratings. WOW!",

I always order the Chorizo Cowboy Skillet with corn tortillas and add a side of bacon.  This is probably not good for me.  My wife orders the Mediterranean Omelet with a side of fruit. This is probably better for her.    In either case, we consistently enjoy our breakfasts here.  In fact, out of all the breakfast places in Phoenix, this is the one that we both enjoy every time.  The service this morning was quick, and in spite of a huge rush, the servers were kind of awesome.",

The place doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside was nicer.  Food came out fast and was quite delicious (Belgian waffle with strawberries, Cowboy chorizo). We also had a spicy, tasty, Bloody Mary. Service was quick and friendly.  One star off for pricing. I understand it's a brunch place and they make a profit off breakfast fare, but the pricing was super inconsistent. Waffle was pretty small for ~$8, yet the Bloody Mary was huge and delicious for just $5.",

Yesterday, (Friday), I saw an email that was sent about the weekend specials. Chilaquiles Egg Bake w/ Hash Browns. CHILAQUILES??!! I LOVE CHILAQUILES! I dreamt about the chilaquiles. SERIOUSLY. The first thing I said to my husband this morning was: \"let's go to 5th Ave Cafe, they have chilaquiles as the special.\" He knows that I've been on a quest to find the perfect chilaquiles. Whenever I see a place that makes them, I make a point to go try them. Most places are  'just okay', some are decent, very few are great. After all, Nobody makes chilaquiles like my mama used to make! I loved them! I encourage you to check them out!  They were great, they were even better than my mama's - but don't tell her.",

Try my namesake the \"MIACH\" for breakfast special if offered.  It is a buttery croissant with scrambled eggs, bacon and Swiss and hash browns, to perfection, on the side.  YUMMY!!!!!  And I want to give a shout out to the servers that are great!! Paula, Krista, Zeus, Balthazar and our favorite, Dawn!",

This restaurant was my last stop before leaving Phoenix.  I had some mediocre food while I was in town bit this restaurants made up for it.  Definitely try it out if you are in Phoenix.",

I was at the 5th Avenue Cafe this morning (my first visit) for a breakfast meeting and it was one of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant. The staff sat around talking with each other and anytime we asked for anything, like wanting to order or get refills, it was as though we were ruining their day. The fruit we were given was rotten and the staff didn't seem to care that it was rancid.   The place seems dirty, the walls were filthy and my water glass was either very old or dirty. After the meeting I went to the ladies room and it smelled horrible and I noticed, just in time, that there was fecal matter all over the toilet.   This place is in desparate need of some rejuvenation, some attitude adjustments and just some overall care.  Needless to say, I won't be back ever and I won't be recommending this place to anyone. There are too many good restaurants in this area if you are considering this place I would suggest you go else where.",

    "text": "Honestly I've never heard of this place. I was in the area searching for a breakfast spot and this random little nugget appeared. It was a toss up between this place and The Good Egg. Needless to say 5th Avenue Cafe was the right choice.  Right from the get go my party and I noticed the amazing decor. It had a Memphis feel to it with alot of jazz themed nick nacks everywhere. There was some good music playing too. (Herby Hancock)   Waitress was pretty friendly and attentive. She told us that their skillet dishes were their main dishes. Unfortunately their waffle machine was down and they had to wait for some guy to come fix it. I thought that strange for some reason.  Their menu is large. Typical breakfast menu except everything was southwestern style! Also the prices were pretty cheap. We decided to share food. So we got their homemade pancake, French toast, Bacon omelette, biscuits and gravy, and spiced potatoes. All good. Allow me to describe each dish in detail!!  First those potatoes were.....perfect. Cooked just right. spiced just right. There was a slight crunch that was consistent throughout the dish which meant the chef knew what they were doing. They were the red potatoes too. The soft interior filled my taste buds with delight. Each bite made me think about life and how good it was.   Then there was the Bacon omelette. But that's to vague. It was actually the Bacon avoacoado perfectly seasoned tomato and sausage gravy omelette with a side of sour cream. (We added the gravy on ourselves). Was this heaven? I submit yes! How did they perfectly cook the Bacon and eggs together with the tomatoes so eligantly? Magic? However they did it, it worked. Each bite was satisfying. Delectable is the only word that comes to mind. The only thing that could have made it better was cheese. Oh wait a minute, there was cheese! Swiss cheese to be exact. Melted and aged just right.   My goodness the French toast was just simply not fair. Why? Because for now on if I want the best French toast in the world I have to go to 5th Avenue Cafe. Which means I have to drive downtown each and every time. But....its absolutely worth it. Soft yet crunchy goodness. Powdered sugar not overbearing. And once you top it with syrup, you melt. Read that again. The French toast stays crunchy somehow (again magic), but you yourself melt. After the first bite, I sat back in my seat and pondered the applications of modern miracles. Was I even allowed to take another bite of this......beautiful creation? How can I be? Who am I to say that I'm worthy enough to do so? Whatever I did anyways. And it was good.  Pancake was also pretty good. There was a nice slight buttery taste. And although not fluffy, it did melt in your mouth. It paired nicely with my cup of coffee. (Speaking of food pairing, I noticed a large beer selection. Next time I come in I will delve into my other passion).   We also got a side of Bacon just to sample it. Very good. The friend I was with described it as \"salty goodness.\" To me it was slightly over cooked but that's just a personal preference.  Overall perfect place. Also all that which I described which filled us up cost less than $20.00!!!!!! Another miracle? No just people who can make good food, and present reasonable prices due to skillfull accounting practices.  This place has become my spot. Sorry \"The Place\" but I like breakfast here better. But \"The Place\" does have a large beer selection as well including local beers on tap. So maybe their tied?   Ok bye.",

    "text": "I have been coming here for quite some time now. On weekends the place is usually busy and their is a wait. But as of late, it hasn't been as packed on the weekends. I did notice they raised prices on the menu so I'm not sure if they raised prices to make up for lack of customers or if it's not as busy because of the raised prices. Food is still very good and portion sizes have remained the same. But if your breakfast comes with toast and you want Raisin toast, it's $1 more than regular toast now. Service is still good and prompt even when busy too. The price increase hasn't really deterred the regulars and it's nothing too outrageous but something's are noticeable like with the toast. They used to a have a loyalty punch card that if you got 10 punches, your next meal was free. So maybe they should bring that back to accommodate for the price change. Overall food is still good and service is still good. I will still come back even though prices have changed.",

When I inquired to the server about the Yelp offer she was completely unaware of it; I tried displaying the Yelp offer but it was nowhere to be found.  Anyhow we where there and hungry so we ordered.  The food was ok.  Great wheat bread, my hasbrowns ordered crispy were not.  Later the manager came over and I mentioned how we got to the place and she gave me a high five (a hands high five) this was the name of the special that lured us inside.

The perfect scenario: you had too much to drink the other night, you roll out of bed with a hangover, your stomach is growling, and you want to go somewhere where you can be in your pj's practically and no one will notice or care, head to 5th Avenue Cafe.    The not so perfect scenario:  Roll out of bed, put on makeup, fix my hair, put on some shorts, cute shirt, high heels - and I am ready to eat some good breakfast at a \"cool, trendy\" spot.  A few restaurants come to mind:  Matt's Big Breakfast or Snooze. .  But....I want to go somewhere new.  So I check yelp and I find 5th ave cafe.   I ordered the corned beef hash and honestly, I really had no complaints.  The service was mediocre.  No one really checked up on us.  Then I look around and we are kind of the trendy duo in this restaurant.  No one was checking the news or checking the internet on their phone.  No one was dressed the way we were dressed.  I kinda felt a little lost and honestly, overdressed.  I then thought maybe I can make myself feel like I belong again by heading to Lux for an almond milk vanilla latte, but I decided to just head home.  When I got home, the p.j.'s went back on and then I felt whole again.",

One, two and three stars do not need much explanation it will be evident in the review. Four stars is we had a good meal and I will consider eating there when I am in the area. Five stars? I am planning on going back as soon. I will make a special trip to go eat there. Even if I have to drive 20 or 30 miles to do it.  We had just got our taxes done. It was ab out 9:00am and we wanted breakfast. I did go to Yelp to find a place in the area and this place had some pretty good reviews. If you blink you will miss the building. I had to turn around and come back as I did miss it. Parking in front is limited. I do not know what is is back or street.  The theme is music. There are many pictures of music and musical instruments around the room. The room is laid out simple tables and booths. There were quite a few people eating there but the noise was quite. Everything looked clean and orderly. The food was good, but breakfast is hard to mess up. I had two eggs, bacon, sliced tomato instead of hash browns, and coffee. It was good. The beacon was nice thick slices, not the skinny stuff you get some places.  One of the big reasons for the 4 stars was the people that worked there. Everyone was very helpful and willing to substitute items on a listed menu meal. Some places are not or want to charge extra. Her attitude was whatever made you happy makes us happy. If I am in the area I will eat there again.",

There are freakin' few breakfast restaurants, except trendy expensive places, that serve alcohol.  Being the day after Christmas a Bailey's 'n coffee sounded pretty good.  No problem.  While my brain pointed me toward a lighter side, I ended up with their corned beef hash, which I'm pretty sure is made on premises.  I topped that with a couple of poached eggs (I almost expected them to tell me no-way, but they cheerfully took the order).  Not being the biggest potato fan I opted for fresh fruit, which was more than adequete.  An order of raisin toast rounded out the meal.  1) Price - superb. didn't see anything over $10 2) Food quality - a few notches above average and way above fast food chains 3) Service - GREAT!  Only thing is they seem to throw multiple servers at you 4) Ambience - pretty cool.  Kind of a musical theme. 5) Clientele - mostly older vets it seems.  Nice guys. 6). Value - For me (a light eater) it was perfect, but the portions are a bit on the small side.  This is one place I will be back.  For breakfast and for lunch.  It's just a good feeling place, and there are so few of them left.",

    "text": "Let's just say I had to nurse a hangover this morning and wasn't really feeling Joe's Diner or going to Denny's either. So, I decided to try this place which had some decent reviews. Overall, my impression of this place is good, and it is definitely tucked away inside a non-descript strip mall across the hospital (keep your eyes peeled if you're coming here). This is a good breakfast place. I'd come back, but it's not some place to write home about necessarily.   Food quality was above average and the prices are more than reasonable. For $ 7.95, I got three slices of french toast, 3 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, and a healthy portion of hash browns. Be forewarned, the portions are sizable. I asked for my eggs scrambled soft, and they did a really good job. Bacon was a little over crispy for my taste. The french toast was yummy and the coffee was pretty good (though I think my hangover could care less what kind of coffee it was). The portion size, the quality for the price earn this cafe some plus points.   This place also has a full service bar, which is a good thing for some place like this to have.   Service definitely earned this place a demerit this time, albeit not a really serious one. The place was not super busy, but it took forever to get my coffee cup refilled. Other than that, service was attentive, friendly, and efficient.   Grades:  Overall Rating: B+   Discretionary Points for price and portion size.   Food Quality: B+  -  Good breakfast food, good job on soft scrambling the eggs and                                    French Toast. Bacon could use significant improvement.   Service: B-   -   When you say you're going to be right back with the coffee pot,                             come right back, don't go behind the counter and have a chat.                             Bring me some damn coffee!  Drinks: N/A - They do have a full bar, but I did not try it. Adding fuel to a hangover                          fire is not that smart.",

Then a parade of servers will make sure your order is promptly taken, your coffee and water promptly refilled and your dishes promptly cleared.  The location is good, especially convenient for anyone working or visiting St. Joseph's hospital right across the street. It's also historical. The restaurant originally operated as Upton's (established 1955), a well known dining spot for politicians and celebrities back in the day.  The food is great. Breakfast and lunch. One in our party this day mentioned that the Top of the Morning Omelette was the best omelette she had eaten in ages. The pancakes are light and fluffy. The coffee is served black and hot. Unique requests are happily honored. Specials are posted on a chalk board behind the counter. Mimosas available!  The ambiance is that of a simple diner. Not trendy. Not industrial. Not mid-century modern. It's comfy. The 5th Avenue Cafe is a locally owned neighborhood restaurant that serves classic comfort food. Expect friendly people, advertisements embedded in the tables and delicious food.",

There aren't any options on their menu that are super 'special' or 'different,' but this is a diner, so that wasn't expected. I tried their grits (they were fairly tasty), pumpkin pancakes (pretty yummy), egg sandwich on an english muffin (probably could make this at home, but the egg was cooked correctly, which I appreciate), and the chicken fried steak (can't comment.... I don't typically like chicken fried steak anywhere). This place is a no frills diner and I'd definitely return if I felt like that kind of breakfast.",

Then .... I found 5th Ave Cafe while driving one day and gave it a try.  Man oh man!  One of the best random decisions I've ever made lol.... this is my absolute favorite place in the Valley to get breakfast.  My favorite!  And now my boyfriend's favorite!  And now my cousin's favorite whenever she comes to visit.  It's that good!  2 of our absolute favorite dishes: Sausage and gravy, scrambled eggs and bacon.  The other is the buttery croissant sandwich with rosemary potatoes.  We've tried plenty of things, waffles, french toast, salads, plenty of things!  Everything is absolutely divine!  Give them a try!  My goodness ... I can't believe i'm just writing a review on my favorite place!",

Our group of 8 was seated quickly and we had our coffee and water lickity-split!   From the person who seated us to our waiter we were super happy with your service. The menu had an option for every one .... and the coffee was so so good and thank you for constantly keeping my cup full!  If you're looking for a traditional American breakfast that doesn't taste like it's from a conveyor belt, you have found your place! I ordered the biscuits and gravy (which came with eggs and bacon) which was super good, I also had a nibble of my co-worker's chicken fried steak and another's pancake ... All were worth ordering. The gravy was good, not too peppery.  Their lunch menu looked tasty so I have a feeling a few of us will be back for a burger in the near future.    //cheers//",

Outside looks like a pretty normal restaurant, but once we walked inside I realized we had made the right choice. It is darker inside and have the feeling of an old town diner where locals can grab a quick bite or linger for drinks and laughs. We were greeted quickly and were immediately served with drinks. My companions chose a BLT and the other wanted the Philly Steak.  I chose the special which was a Southwest spicy pasta. All portions were generous meaning two people could share. The only reason I gave one less star is because my pasta was a little limp, but the sauce put the bravo on the dish. Don't forget to get the Yelp High Five when you check in. This delicious lunch gave us enough energy to climb South Mountain.",

My husband ordered an omelette which looked great and he said was good. The hash brown potatoes were good but very oily - so much so that I only ate the top crispy part. I ordered two eggs over medium with sour dough toast & the egg white was runny over the majority of the egg. It also had a pool of oil on top (see pic). The orders of toast which were one slice cut in half were drenched in the butter substitute and soggy. My guess is the butter flavored crisco is used heavily in this kitchen. Keep in mind that I did not bring this to the attention of staff as I'm sure they would have remade the eggs and toast as they were all very nice and excellent servers. I just don't like doing that. The iced tea was very good.",

Decided upon the patty melt and for a dollar more some O-rings.  WoW!!    Yum!   Literally one of the best Patty Melts I've had. EVER!! And the Rings!! Yum!! The Rye was grilled perfectly. The onions were nice and crisp, sweet and perfectly cooked, melty cheese and a perfectly cooked medium well burger. Juicy and nicely charred. The onion rings were panko crusted I believe but tender on the inside, minced sweet onion and oh so good.  An eclectic place, it was a diner with a modern vibe. I struck up a conversation with some 'regulars' while I was waiting. They were very charming. The server and counter staff were very friendly.  Highly recommend!!",

I could literally eat it at every meal, but there are 4 reasons I prefer to keep coming back down to 5th Avenue Cafe.  1) Atmosphere. It's the little things that make a restaurant great, and this place has them all. It's clean, colorful, well-lit, and the servers seem believably happy.   2) Great food. No, it isn't five star (but then you're not paying 5-star prices are you?). No it isn't arranged on the place like a piece of art - but with breakfast food, the \"proof is in the pudding.\" And it's never disappointed me as far as taste or quality are concerned.  3) The people. The patrons of 5th Avenue Cafe are among the \"salt of the earth\" category. They're accepting, approachable, warm, easygoing, and unassuming - as are all of the staff. This makes it a place both worth visiting AND coming back to. 4) Her.  There is one waitress there that has a smile that will melt your heart. This goes back to what I said about the staff being believably cheery. She's a truly happy person, which is all but rare most places I find myself - the kind of person that radiates it out. All the servers are kind and cheery, she's just a little more-so.  She serves near the front (Thomas-side) of the restaurant. Sit up there - she'll treat you nice, and enjoy your breakfast at the 5th Avenue Cafe.",

I actually forgot for a moment that I was in the heart of one of the biggest cities in the United States.  The food is top notch too. For whatever reason I enjoy my lunch and dinners to be a bit gourmet, but my breafast to be greasy and simple.  I got three pancakes, three eggs, 2 pieces of sausage, and hashbrowns all for $6.25.  These days it's hard to find a deal like this.  I would recommend this place to people looking for a small town diner feel, tasty food, and good prices.",

Also enjoyed seeing so many locals and many 90 plus year olds.  We sat ourselves and were greeted immediately by the one and only waitress, Paula.  The place was packed.  They have hot green tea and the food was better than Matt's Big Breakfast.  They have an awesome wood counter and wooden chairs plus the tables with the booths have been finished nicely.  My dad had the veggie cowboy with rye toast and instead of potatoes a side of fruit and we were not charged for the substitution.  I elected to have the pancakes and two eggs as I am searching AZ for the best pancakes.  These were okay nothing to rave about but the fact they were better than Matts big breakfast.  When eating pancakes, if I can cut them with just my fork and they taste good with just butter they are great.  These needed to be cut with a knife and they were on a little bit dry.  Great service and great decor.  If we lived closer we would come again.",

My wife has a couple of dietary restrictions because of our child's sensitivities which makes going out to eat a bit difficult but not impossible.  The staff at 5th Ave made us feel like we'd been going there for years.  She can't have soy or dairy or the little one gets 'backed up' and our waitress and the manager bent over backwards to ensure that we were in the clear.  We've hit up all of the high end restaurants in the Phx/Scotts area during our stay here and I must say they were more accommodating than the majority of those places. Just wonderful and sincere people all around.  The food was great, the service was 5 star.  Thank you guys so much for making our rare Saturday outing so easy and enjoyable.

The side salad is iceberg blah, the clam chowder is creamy blah, and my friends agreed the Philly sandwich was shoulder-shrugging blah. The waitress was nice enough, but hard a difficult time grasping that I did NOT want a refill of my soda. Really, one giant glass is more than enough, already!",

My hubby introduced me to this place about 10 years ago and I/we are regulars.  Customers are always welcomed with a greeting & a smile.  Service is great!  Wonderful place to have a quick business lunch or leisurely meal with a friend,  while service is quick, you never feel rushed.  The owners,  Dawn & Earl,  make time to know their customers & check in with all.  Balthazar usually has my iced tea at my table as soon as I sit down and Gabby, Crystal,  Jesse & Paula take excellent care of us.  LOVE THIS PLACE!",

    "text": "I went to 5th Avenue Cafe today ready to have some brunch (well breakfast food really). I absolutely love breakfast. Aside from ice cream, it's my favorite.   The atmosphere was okay. We were at a huge table off to the side due to the large number of people in our party. I quickly noticed that the fans in the building did not cover the one half of our table. We had to fan ourselves with items we could find at the table. We were asked if we wanted separate checks, which was a nice bonus with a large table.  I ended up ordering an omelet, hash browns, and rye toast. The hash browns and the omelet were a little drier than I would've hoped for. I don't like greasetastrophes, but I do like a little flavor. It was, however, a large portion of food, and I ended up only being able to finish half of it.  It wasn't bad to the point that I won't ever go back again, but I'm not sure it will be on my list of places to visit in a hurry.",

Its not meant to be.  What its meant to be is well prepared comfort food, good service and a friendly welcoming attitude.  It totally succeeds.  My eggs are always perfectly cooked, my hash nice and crispy and they always crisp my hash browns perfectly for me.  Their hamburgers are really good.  I particularly like their BLT.  Its loaded with bacon and the tomatoes are always ripe and juicy.  Their rotating lunch dishes are just like mama made. Their Saturday and Sunday brunch specials are very good.  The prices are reasonable and compare very well with other places in the area. To make a long story short I love the place and go there every chance I get.",

If I see the Country Fried Steak on the breakfast menu, it's a go-to. Some of the best I have ever had, and I lived in the south for twenty years! My wife had the green chile and cheese omelet and ate every bite. The staff was very nice. When we were leaving, they were putting tables together for a large group of ladies having their breakfast get-together--very accommodating. I'll be back next time we head up the road from Tucson!",

We never have to wait for service and are brought beverages as soon as we sit down!  The gentleman who busses tables and brings beverages always serves with a smile and asks how we are doing.  All the servers are great but we always try to sit in Gabby's section as she is AWESOME!  Dawn and Earl are the owners and really make all their customers feel at home.  We always see Dawn on Sundays and she always makes it a point to come to come over and say hello.  The food is great- everything we've ever had there is super tasty!  They also do very well with large groups as I brought the entire family over one Sunday, the day after my sister's wedding to have a great brunch.  They were on the ball and extemely pleasant.  I highly recommend trying this place if you haven't yet!!",

Gabby was our server, and she was very welcoming and brought one of the basic food groups (coffee) to us almost immediately upon request. I had the Cowboy breakfast ((hash browns were extra crispy as I wanted) and Peggy got the cheese omelette complete with hash browns also crispy as ordered.  Earl was nearby and was a joy to meet.  He was very cordial and he felt like (welcomed!) family from the get-go.  This will definitely be on our list of go-backs when we are around the area...and likely even if we make the drive from NE Scottsdale. Once again, a small place which emphasizes on great food and customer service.  Sorry to miss out on the danish which I saw from a previous blogger was \"the best in town!\"  Dr. B",

The gravy could have used more pepper and sausage in it but I resolved the pepper situation and the giant sausage patties that came with my meal helped solve the other situation.  I came out of here full and happy.  The price is right and the place is full of a great mix of different people.  Really a good place to people watch.  I will most likely come back.",

He then says; I know anywhere except 5Th ave. The boy knows me so well ;-[) I tell him no I will go today, it has been a while since I have given in and gone with the masses. I just do not like the place. So we walk over and are greeted by a bubbly waitress. This place always has nice wait people. She talks with us for a few minutes and then takes our order.  Oh the food, the food. I order a french dip with Cole slaw and a side of onion rings. Bruce has his usual a BLT with well done bacon and fries. Now mind you we are the only folks ordering at the time and still it takes an unusual amount of time to get the food. Which by the way would have been better if we had never gotten our food. What I get is roast beef cut thickly and with the grain. Now anyone who likes a french dip knows the meat should be supple and sliced thinly, piled nicely on the bun. It should also have a rich beef flavour as should the au jus. I mean even the lowly of the low line cook should know one slices meat against the grain, always. The bun on which it sat was just that, a meat seat. I also love Cole slaw and usually will eat what is served, not this. Totally lacking any inspiration resulting in no flavour. The rings looked good, but looks can be deceiving. So Bruce you are right, any place but 5Th ave.",

Even though the restaurant was crowded and there was music playing softly, we had no problem hearing one of the staff welcome us and let us know we could sit where we like. Our server, Zeus, welcomed us and took our drink order within a minute of sitting down.  Drinks: Diet Coke and water with lemon   The drinks arrived promptly and we were ready to order.  Food: Cowboy skillet scramble with tortilla, side of sausage links, French toast with over easy egg, hash browns, orange wedge, bacon, and side of biscuit and gravy.  The food came out really quick! Everything tasted incredible. It's the kind of place that has been cooking their menu with love for a long time so everything has had its deliciousness perfected. Just really outstanding flavor.  Zeus made sure we had everything we needed and kept our drinks refilled throughout the meal without being intrusive. A True masterwork in serving. The check was dropped off nearing the end of the meal at the perfect time. With all that we ordered it was only $30. That's right, all that food and only thirty USD. Pretty amazing.  Again, 5th Avenue Cafe most likely has a huge following already so this news isn't moving any mountains. But if you're looking for a fantastic place with a great atmosphere, friendly staff, and terrific food there is no better place than 5th Ave.",

We had skillets, pancakes, and huevos rancheros over two consecutive mornings and it was all really good. Place is super clean, staff are friendly and efficient. Good music while you eat and good local art on the walls as well as a bunch of old musical instruments. Plenty of AC and ceiling fans spinning to keep you cool inside even in Phoenix in July. If you are looking for a good simple breakfast or lunch downtown this is for sure your place. I think you'll leave happy.",

    "text": "This place is a nicely hidden gem. Me and the son went there for some breakfast before his BJJ tourney. We were warmly welcomed and sat ourselves at the bar. He had the biscuits and gravy meal and I had the corned beef hash meal. Everything came as we liked. Food was great and was the right amount. The hostess?/owner?/manager? lady was a warm smile as well as graciously welcoming. The other staff was also friendly and great.   I honestly have nothing but good things to say about the food. It's better than you'd expect and the right amount of food. I admit I was skeptical when I saw my plate. But after finishing it I realized it was legitimately the perfect amount. Son didn't finish his but I did warn him before he ordered the biscuits n gravy MEAL. He cleared the biscuits and gravy (the best part) and most of the bacon, eggs and hash browns that were left.   Overall this place was great. If I am ever in the area I will absolutely come here again. Heck, I may make a weekend trip just for kicks! You won't be disappointed.",

We celebrated his 50th birthday last evening and awoke feeling a tad rough, as you do after a milestone celebration, and knew we needed food STAT!  Despite it being Sunday, and the restaurant being busy, we sat ourselves and were greeted post haste by a lovely lady. Because I'd checked in here, I asked her what the check-in offer was about...a free high-five with my breakfast order. She looked confused, then promptly gave me a high-five, explaining it was the owners idea of a joke!  Ha! Love it!  Our breakfast orders were then taken and 10 minutes later came to our table.  My BFF ordered the Chorizo Omelette with a side of bacon, while I went with 2 eggs, hash browns, bacon, and 2 pancakes. Everything was perfect! Over easy eggs were actually over easy! The bacon was thick cut, smoky sweet, and crispy. The chorizo wasn't overly greasy and was excellently seasoned, and my pancakes were fluffy and served with REAL butter!!  We were asked how our meal was by another lady (never got her name) and when she discovered I was visiting from Tucson and would be driving back within the hour, brought me 2 cups of ice for my trip Home!  Great food! Great, prompt service! This establishment truly cares about their customers!   Thanks 5th Ave. Cafe!",

The Caesar salad (how can you fuck this up).... you get a bed of lettuce, a tablespoon of drizzled dressing-not even enough for a side salad, so if you like dressing, be prepared to pay extra. I had asked for no croutons, Heaven forbid you have anytime of allergies when coming here, and had to remove them when it came. After that, our waiter decided to check on us as little as possible. He asked if we wanted more water when he brought us our meal, finally brought it when we were done. All of the staff seemed extremely bored, the younger ones (including our waiter) were making fun of customers, while ignoring them. Not a fan",

We were a party of 3, they told me to take a table where ever and we choose one right by the front door. Well after watching people who came in after us, getting menus and beverages, at the 15 minute mark of not even being acknowledged, took my business down the street.

Sat at the counter, had a nice waitress, while the other two did not seem like they wanted to be there at all or didnt know what they were doing.   Ordered bacon and swiss omelette with hash browns and wheat toast. Omlette: subpar. Bacon wasnt cooked enough, nor was there really much in there, same with the cheese, not cheesy at all. Cooked fine though. The hash browns were cooked in enough butter, but learn to season with salt and pepper.  One of the most basic things as a cook is to season your food.

    "text": "My new favorite breakfast place!! I've only been here twice now, but I'm sold.  First off, the prices are awesome!! The first visit we tried to choose the most expensive things on the breakfast menu because we were trying to spend $20 to use a gift certificate... With coffee we still only hit $16. No problem though, we are stoked to go back!!   The coffee was excellent, and not too strong like some diners tend to do. Heavy, wide-lipped mugs only added to my drinking pleasure.  Hash browns were superb, and I tend to rate places based on their potatoes, so that's a win for me.  The decor is comfortable and welcoming, plus there's an antique trombone hanging on the wall... high-five for that. The bathroom is through the back, and it's a tiny half-bath style you would see in someone's house. I like that about it too, because it adds to the comfortable atmosphere. My only complaint is both times I was there, the floor was extremely wet, like some pipe is leaking but no one has bothered to figure out which one.  There are also TVs in here, which seems weird but is actually kind of nice if you are there on Sunday and feel like watching a game. Bloody Marys seem to be the drink to order for Sunday morning breakfast and brunch! For the size of the place and the items on their menu, they have a decent beer selection as well.  The other great thing about this place is they are conveniently located just off the light rail route, so it's very easy to hop off on Central and Thomas and take a nice stroll down for breakfast. (You get to pass Pink Spot too, in case you are hankering for some ice cream after your meal!) Riding the light rail is a big plus now that I've moved to the east valley, but still love coming downtown.",

    "text": "I do like this cafe. I enjoy coming here for a good breakfast and at least once a week my job will order lunch from here. I have always had good food, but I have to say there is one waitress inparticular that is just lousy! It's as if she doesn't care about her job, the customers or getting a tip.  I've had the displeasure of having her as a waitress twice and next time I go in there for breakfast I know very well not to sit in her section.   This past Saturday it took at least 10 minutes to get menus, another 10 for drinks and when she brought our food that was the last time we saw her. She never came back to check on us or give us refills.   I reference this same waitress in my other review, so clearly since July her attitude hasn't changed.   There are other really friendly and helpful waitress and bus boys that work at this cafe and they all work really hard make an effort to ensure you have a good visit, but this one waitress could give a crap and it really shows.  I hate to not tip servers because I know that is part of how they make a living, but if the service and the attitude is going to be so apathetic, then you don't get a tip from me!",

Service was standard, the place was kind of clean, table smelled funky but it wasn't distracting from the food.  Got much more food than would have at iHop and it was still cheaper",

Being from the east coast, I know you can't judge a book by its cover... so no judgements were made walking in... Honestly ... outside of the Roscoe's Baseball team... the patrons nor the restaurant has changed in 30+ years.. ( clothing or fixtures )   The service was pleasant, and decent... large classic plastic glasses that hold the beverages are a good value and no need to ever ask for a refill.   I had a typical breakfast.. eggs over, hash browns, link sausage and wheat toast. All arrived hot and flavorful... the sausage, regardless of ingredients... was the best I've ever had in Arizona... I will be back just for them!!   I noticed a full bar, and although I didn't ask, I can imagine that I could come here for a raging drink fest and not pay much... I hope that at night the bartender is an old, surly woman slamming the drinks down for me... that would make it picture perfect!",

My better half had the one egg, hash browns, turkey sausage, and toast. I felt like having pancakes so I ordered the small stack. I looked around and noticed their wall decor was different. Which is fine by me, gives it a different look feel, even though the rest of the restaurant hasn't changed since I began coming here. This place is more frequented by local surrounding residents living nearby. Even though it's situated right across from a hospital you don't see much of the hospital staff here. Strictly loyal customers are the ones that frequent here. This place serves breakfast and lunch only. The inside is has an older style charm that makes you feel comfortable. The restrooms are for both genders and kept clean. There is a breakfast and lunch counter as well. I must mention this as well, one of our late Senators came here in the mornings to have breakfast at his favorite seat at the counter. Whenever I come here I always get a little bit nostalgic, for if I lived nearby I would even just come here for coffee and just sit at the breakfast counter and have a conversation with the restaurant staff. By the way I can't forget their restaurant employees which provide very good service. If you happen to be by this place, stop by and have a breakfast or lunch, or whatever fancies you.",

There are multiple specials every day.  I love the gyro, the chicken philly, the Mediterranean salad and all of the soups!  It's perfect if u are looking for comfort foods or a light lunch.  The service isn't speedy by any means but it's nice to sit and relax and take in the old timey decor or have a chat with a friend or coworker.  The owner is usually around and is very hands on.  She always makes me feel welcome and appreciated.  Today I was nursing a cold so came in for a turkey sandwich and soup.  Skipping the chicken noodle I came for and going for the clam chowder because I just couldn't resist.  The soup was creamy and tasty with chunks of potatoes and clams.  The roasted turkey sandwich is just wholesome and not overdone with aioli and such.  Very refreshing to get a simple but delicious sandwich with a cup of soup instead of fries.  While I was checking out the owner even gave me some tips on how to ditch my cold quick like change ur toothbrush and pillow case every day.  It looks like only a few parking spots in front but there are plenty in the back too.  This diner always has a healthy crowd of peeps dining and enjoying the food.  And you get a free high five with a check in on Yelp!  Too funny!",

There must be a different chef from all the previous good ones. Don't get me wrong the tablespoon of corned beef hash I got was delicious but you can't really mess up corned beef hash from a can. So I'll begin with the toast that I'm not sure can really be considered toast if it is still as white as it was when it came out of the package. Then the bacon, both orders that came to the table were burnt beyond recognition. I received a decent serving of 1/2 cooked hash Browns and a dollop of corned beef hash but if that is supposed to be the meal I should be able to taste that prevelantly.  I used to get such a good serving of corned beef hash that I always had to take some home. Then we were going to share 1 pancake because they used to be the size of the plate. Well what came out was a white pancake not even finished or brown which was the size of one of those microwave pancakes. I'm sooooo disappointed after today's visit, new chef or not ; it will be a long time before we come back",

    "text": "Thank you friendly kind staff of 5th Avenue Cafe for the much needed delicious breakfast and for making me feel welcomed and at home!   After finishing my night shift I walked across the street to this cafe I knew must be a winner because of what I saw, smelled and heard as I stepped inside.  Almost burst into tears of gratefulness for the wonderful orange juice... I know I am weird, but if you drink hotel breakfast or hospital orange juice as much as I do you'd understand.   Omelet was PERFECT because of the yummy sausage and high quality cheese and veggies!  They do it right!  Best sour dough toast ever too!  A family of 10 came in right after me and I was super impressed by the seamless ease in which the staff put the tables together including baby high chair.   People were just happy in that place.",

I used to try to go to Matt's Big Breakfast but honestly it isn't worth a two or greater hour wait for bacon and eggs.    First of all, 5th Avenue Cafe has plenty of seating.  Their meals are good.  Their portions on the gigantor side which can be a good or bad thing.  Just realize that when you are ordering.    their Huevos are probably the best around.    A superlative choice if you want a breakfast that is scrummers!",

Our drinks were always full and I could see that pretty much everybody elses drinks were full as well.   We had the breakfast (I had the Mediterranean Omelet, my husband had the Green chili omelet) and we were both thoroughly impressed. The food was delicious! I would certainly recommend 5th Ave Cafe to anybody interested in a tasty breakfast.   I have not tried the lunch yet, but their lunch menu looks great. I will definitely be back to check out their lunch and have their breakfast again.   Great staff, very inviting, wonderful food!",

The walls are adorned with jazz-related art and knicknacks.  They have a pretty good selection of breakfast items, like pancakes, French toast, scrambles and breakfast bowls, as well as lunch sandwiches, salads and burgers. They include several vegetarian selections, which is much appreciated.  I highly recommend the seasoned red potatoes as a side, they go as marvellously with a burger as they do with French toast.  They will even substitute them for hash browns in your Veggie Cowboy if you ask.  It's also nice and cheap.  All around, a great place to go for a breakfast/lunch on a weekend morning/afternoon.",

    "text": "Far and away the restaurant I have frequented most often, 5th Avenue is superlative for service and food quality for the price. Other reviews describe it as a greasy spoon or good hangover food. Perhaps - but then if these folks were looking for cordon bleu, they were in the wrong place, weren't they. It's a breakfast/lucnh place, so compare it to Denny's or IHOP - with exponentially improved quality.  It's as healthy as you make it - you can order french toast, eggs, and bacon or an egg white omlette! They are awesome at accepting alterations on menu items. The only thing I ever ordered that I didn't like wa the Fiesta Omlette - chili beans over eggs. Not because it wasn't tasty - but it was just a weird combination that didn't work for me.  This morning, boyfriend and I went for breakfast. The cafe was busier than we've ever seen it - and, according to the owner, busier than he's ever seen it either! Absolutely love seeing local businesses thrive.  If you're ever in Central Phoenix near 7th Avenue and Thomas and need a bite for breakfast or lunch, 5th Avenue Cafe may really surprise you with their homey atmosphere, friendly service, good food, and low prices.",

Today I ordered a Buffalo Lite Salad and it came with COLD and DRY buffalo chicken lightly dripped in buffalo sauce on a bed of lettuce and about a half cup of shredded cheddar cheese.   The amount of cheese was overwhelming and there were really no cucumbers or tomatoes to speak of.  Had about 5 croutons though.  Very dissappointed.  The second disappointment of the day was that the owners also cancled their \"Loyalty\" card program as of 12/31/15.  I understand not issuing new cards as a result of higher egg and meat costs, but to pull the program already in place?  Doesn't feel right.  Your card is only good if you have all 10 visits punched out and it's time for your free one.  But if you were on #9 and today was your 10th visit you're out of luck because the program stopped on 12/31.  So my question to 5th Ave Dinner is, \"Who was loyal to whom?\"  No need to rush back for lunch.  I will say breakfast is usually pretty decent.",

The menu here isn't terribly inventive, but you shouldn't expect it to be.  I chose the Cowboy Scramble, or something similarly named, which was eggs, bacon, ham, cheese, and hash browns all scrambled together.  Literally, it was all scrambled, not just layered.  It wasn't the prettiest dish to behold, but it was pretty tasty, and I would definitely order it again.  It tasted fantastic and was incredibly filling.  I only got about halfway through it.  I will definitely come back here again.  Service is good, the location is good, the food is good, and best of all, they have a decent parking situation.  Yay!",

IT WAS AWESOME! WE had 12 people and - can I say- that usually a large party would have to wait because the kitchen couldn't handle such a large order at once BUT NOT at 5th Ave Cafe. Our food was out so fast, it was unexpected. Dawn was so kind, she insisted that I enjoy my hubby's birthday and she even took pictures and cut & served the cake. The food was excellent, the servers are awesome and I couldn't have asked for a better place. From the bus peeps to the servers to the chefs/cooks to the owners- THE BEST PLACE EVER! They cater too...we will always make time to go to 5th Ave Cafe for breakfast & lunch (killer Patty Melt, BTW) but NOW, we have a place to celebrate birthdays, Anniversary's  and really any occasion where we want to have great food and enjoy the time. THANK YOU 5th Ave Cafe!! OH- just a side note...a few week ago I ordered the sausage & eggs - I didn't eat the sausage...when they picked up my plate the owner found his way over to our table and asked if there was something wrong. I was surprised  because I didn't know what he was talking about. He went on to say that he noticed I didn't eat the sausage and wanted to know if I was unhappy. I told him, no, it was fine, I just don't like the casings. He sad, no problem to let them know and they'll remove the casings....I was impressed! These people really want to make you happy.. try it- you'll love it!!",

There is a variety of breakfast options, this place is known for their 'Cowboy' options and omelets. I got their Veggie 'Cowboy' skillet, it was not too greasy or too much food. The tortilla was delicious, would recommend getting the tortilla not the toast. 3. Coffee, solid.  4. Prices are very reasonable for all menu options. 5. Lastly and most importantly, Dawn rang my husband and I out at check-out and she was really nice. We were searching the candy basket for candy we like, and she pulls out a box full of candy for us to choose from. AND! She gave me all of the Strawberry candies she could find. Major win in my book!",

    "text": "It has taken me awhile to finally post this review (ummm... hi Yelp App people..... you've made a million updates to the app.... why not a post from app update?!?!)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  You know something that really creeps me out about a place?! ...sticky salt shakers...eeeeew! I mean seriously people... Anyways, I digress.  My friend and I were to be downtown after the R4TC this past Sunday and were looking for a place close enough to the race site to be convenient, yet far enough from it that there would not be a mad rush of other race participants.   We finished the race later than usual, so we arrived at the Cafe around 10:50.  When we entered to the front door, and there were already two other parties in line ahead of us, so we did the logical thing and got in line behind them.  The line was formed by one door, leaving the other door for people to go in and out of (this will be amusing later on in the review).  We stood at the front, there was no host stand nor a spot that was clearly where parties waited to be sat, so we did the lemming thing and stood where everyone else was. On three occasions people just stood outside staring at the blocked door and looked at the line waiting for the whole line to move instead of using the CLEAR door... ummm.. really people?! And of course on all three occasions they had the nerve to be all huffy at us. HA!  Five minutes go by and no one has come to talk to the mass forming at the door, a little miffed, I keep standing there as my friend goes up to the bar/cashier to ask if there is a wait list or something.  Finally, while she is over there a manager? Comes and asks everyone BUT me if we are on the list... ummm.... What I am under the age of 50 so I don't get attention?... just because I may not be your target clientele doesn't mean I am not a paying customer.    Another 10 minutes go by, and after everyone else is sat (including Mr. Huffy Pants that came in after us) we finally get a table.... In the corner, by the office.  Shortly after we are sat someone brings us some water.  And then we wait... and wait... and wait... 10 minutes later someone comes by to ask what we want to drink, we get our coffees and then our server disappears for awhile again.... Now just having done the race and not had anything besides a banana since 6am we were HUNGRY and tired of waiting!   About 45 minutes after we had entered, we finally got to place our orders.  We had to flag people down to get coffee refills 3 times because our server was a magician practicing her disappearing act all morning. Actually, I'm not sure why we kept drinking the coffee because it was old and burnt tasting, but hey caffeine is caffeine. We finally got our food.  sigh.  It was lukewarm, dry (in the case of a waffle), and overcooked.  We were too hungry, and too tired to say anything, but its ok because our server never came by to ask how things were or if we needed anything once we got our food.  Only saw her again when it was time to pay.   We do the R4TC every year, and are always looking for an awesome mom n pop to go to eat at afterwards.... gotta say... this one will definitely NOT make the list.",

I've been here a couple times and every time it has been quite good until today. Today, she came around to ask if everything was okay and I told her with some hesitation that my meal wasn't so great. She was so kind and remedied the entire situation for me. She told me she valued what I said and was going to make sure she fixed the problem for next time.   This is truly a neighborhood restaurant. I love that I can walk here from home and get such wonderful food and service. Yes, they are really busy on the weekends but the servers are clearly working SO hard to do everything they can to take care of diners!   Even though today wasn't the best meal, I still think this place deserves 5 stars because they take such great pride in making sure everything is done right and they take each customers opinion to heart.   I will definitely be back :)",

My boyfriend and I love corned beef hash; it's our big Saturday morning breakfast after a hike or being lazy. Whichever. So after an early morning loop at Dreamy Draw park we decided to go out for hash and found this place. We were among the first customers to walk the through the door. The hostess was friendly and we heard her greeting the few other patrons by name.  Okay so we get some coffee and order our hash. I noticed a few faint bits of lipstick on my mug, yuck. My boyfriend swapped with me and wiped it off because he says he isn't that picky, but still! So then I noticed the wall at our booth was rather grimy as well. But I digress.... We are starving and really looking forward to a big, hearty breakfast! WELL!!! Imagine our surprise when it comes out and there is a small portion of hash that looks like it came out of the same type of can we pick up at the grocery store! It was browned and crisped up nicely but I couldn't get over the fact that I was about to pay nearly $8 for half of a $2.50 can of hash that I eat each week anyway!  To be fair, there were 2 eggs, half a plate of hashbrowns and one slice of toast. The eggs were good, the potatoes were clearly thawed from a bag and toast is ....toast.  I'm not complaining that the food was bad, it wasn't, I'm familiar with canned hash so I couldn't complain. It was all so underwhelming and then the bill came which pushed it over the edge. $21?! A tad overpriced. A cup of mediocre coffee was $2 and I think the half-can-of-hash breakfast was about $1.50 more than I was comfortable paying.  Maybe it's the area, Willo is a high rent district for central Phoenix. I'm not cheap, I make a decent buck but this was not a good value therefore I will not be back. Neither will my boyfriend.",

    "text": "Long story short: pretty darn good place for breakfast with bold Southwestern flavors.  Long story long:  After checking out of our hotel in Phoenix, we had arranged to have breakfast with a friend of mine whom I know via Twitter.  She had gotten off work pretty late the night prior, otherwise we probably would have hung out then, so we opted for breakfast.  I had seen this place and a couple of other ones, and cross referenced her suggestions.  I was leaning toward this place because it was relatively near the 17 going up to Flagstaff, since I wanted to get on the road as soon as possible because we had a long day of driving ahead of us.  I almost drove right by this place.  Not that its impossible to find, I just almost missed it like that.  Walking in, my friend was already waiting for us in a booth.  The place definitely has a little bit of a Southwest feel to it.  Pretty spacious with plenty of seating and it smelled good, which is always a good sign.  Looking at their menu, they had a lot of your typical breakfast cafe type of dishes, but quite a few of them with a Southwest flair.  I eventually decided on the Chorizo Cowboy, a scramble with chorizo, hash browns, and cheddar cheese.  Served with a side of salsa and toast.  I got an orange juice to drink.  Our food came out and it looked and smelled good.  How can you go wrong with chorizo?  And eggs?  And hash browns?  And cheese?  You just can't.  Don't argue with.. nop.. shush!!!  I put some salsa on it and dug in.  Talk about good flavor.  Everything worked well with each other.  I could taste the spices from the chorizo and it was all good.  I will say though there was a tiny bit of a grease puddle on the bottom when I was done, but hey, fat is flavor, hahaha.  Still good though.  We left full, but not stuffed, and satisfied.  Prices were reasonable as well.  I would definitely come back here should I ever find myself in Phoenix.  Hey, you never know ;)",
