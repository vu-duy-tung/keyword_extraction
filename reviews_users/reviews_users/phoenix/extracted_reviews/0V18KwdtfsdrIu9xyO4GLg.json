Both came with a small crispy egg roll, soup and salad. You can order your food spicy, with hotness on a scale of 0 to 5. All of the food was very good. My only complaint was about the salad. I'm not a big fan of iceberg lettuce, which is what was served. I will definitely come back and for sure try some of the other menu items.",

The food is fresh and I believe this place is authentic.  We also had their coconut ice cream with crushed peanut.  It was the creamiest such ice cream I have ever had and had a nice hint of pineapple in it.  It goes very well.  You should know that their spicing is a bit hotter than most Thai places.  So I would recommend starting a notch lower on the heat until you get your bearings.",

    "text": "I wish I could give 3.5 stars. 3 seems like too few, but 4 almost seems like too many. The highlights were great, the lows were more annoying than anything else.  This place opened in our neighborhood a few months ago so my family and I decided to walk over and give it a try. It was delicious! My picky daughter and not-so-picky husband loved the coconut shrimp and chicken chow mein. My son ate up the edamame (it was oversalted but since you don't eat the husk it's no big deal). The fresh rolls were a disappointment. They were filled with the same salad mix that came with the coconut shrimp and the tofu filling was bland. The accompanying peanut sauce was thin, not creamy and rich. My husband had the beef salad with a side of rice and he loved it. The beef was cooked well and the plate was full of flavor. I had the avocado curry with tofu and it was incredible. I ordered it \"thai hot\" and it definitely had some heat. I was happy to have the complimentary coconut ice cream at the end of the meal.   The service needs some improvement. Our appetizers came quickly but the entrees took longer than expected, we even watched other diners, who arrived after us, receive their meals before us which is frustrating. The bathroom has a weird safety lock so you can't ever tell if it is locked--I thought it was broken and inconspicuously mentioned it to the host who gave me a drawn out explanation about the fancy lock. I know how to lock a door, I just didn't want anyone seeing my goodies over their pad thai.  It would be nice if they had smaller cups for children. The only cups with lids they had were styrofoam (cringe, the environment!) and enormous.   We will definitely go back, I look forward to this being our new neighborhood spot.",

I ordered a quick beef Pad Thai L3 special and a side of steamed veggies. The lunch specials comes with a soup or salad (I got the salad) and an egg roll. I was satisfied with everything! Veggies and salad had a nice fresh crunch, egg roll disappeared so fast into my belly that I was sad. I got a 3 spice and it was perfect! I'm not how far numbers go up in spices but with the 3 it had a kick but didn't take out from any flavors. I'm so glad that I don't have to cry on my way to work if I ever forget to pack a lunch. I would definitely recommend this place for a quick lunch!",

    "text": "The husband and I tried this restaurant a couple months back and had a mixed experience. We went on a Saturday night and the place was fairly empty. We ordered the mango curry and the drunken noodles. We also receive a free Thai tea with check in (which was awesome!). The noodles were fantastic.... super spicy and delicious. I'd 100% recommend them. The curry was just ok. Not as thick as I would hope and also lacking in spice and flavor. The real issue was when the bill came. The waiter brought the bill and the mango curry was priced 3$ more than it had been priced on the menu. I asked the waiter about it, and he said that's how it rang up, but that he would get the manager (or owner? not sure). Another man came over, I showed him the menu where it said the curry was 9.99 (or something like that) and he told me that that curry was actually more expensive due to the mango, and they just hadn't updated the menu yet. He then said, I guess I can figure a way to discount it 'if you want.' Uh..... ya, I want. You can't just tell a customer the food they ordered off the menu was actually more expensive after they have already completed the meal..... that isn't how this works. What should have been an easy apologize and fix the bill ended up being an awkward moment that left me questioning the level of honesty of the management of the restaurant. Though I would recommend the food here (and may return for the yummy noodles), I would advise that you check your bill carefully.",

    "text": "Let me just start out by saying the food at Thai Delight is EXCELLENT, and easily worth writing a letter home about. The service is usually fantastic, especially when you have the pleasure of talking with the owner or the other nice young lady that works the Our office is right down the street, so we typically frequent this place at least once or twice a week. I've tried various things on the menu, but I always find myself gravitating back towards the Pad Thai (to die for!). In each of our previous visits, the plates were more than enough food, with no shortage of chicken, shrimp, tofu, etc. However, when our food arrived for lunch today, I couldn't help but notice that there was only one sole, lonely looking shrimp aboard my plate full of Pad Thai noodles and tofu. Having been here several times before and being fully aware of the normal lunch portions, I approached the bald gentleman sitting at the register, and inquired why there was only one shrimp with my food. His flat answer to me was that the 'size of the lunch portion includes one shrimp'. I told him this confuse me because we've only gone for lunch before and it was never like that in the past. He simply said that's how it's supposed to be, and left it at that.  When I returned to our table, a young lady walked in, and the bald dude acknowledged her like he knew her as soon as she sat down. When the waitress arrived, the lady ordered my same dish. When her food arrived, I couldn't help but notice that hers had 3-5 shrimp on it. Lmao  As petty as it sounds, understand this is not strictly about \"shrimp\", or getting a refund (which I Do Not want). It's about the principle of fessing up when a mistake is made, no matter the size of said mistake. Moreover, if the standard is what it is, maybe make it that way across the board if you'd like to keep returning customers just that - returning.   Just my $.02",

We all wanted to try different dishes and compare them to previous experiences.  Companion ordered Egg Rolls and received 5 of them that were crispy and filled with veggies. Personally, I wanted to have the Mee Krob which had large pork slices and was very good.   Dishes that were ordered included Duck Curry (nicely cooked and flavored) and Tom Ka Pork soup, which was quite tasty. One of our party ordered the #18 Platter, which was huge and had shrimp satay and wontons which were made of rolled rice paper. Another ordered #2 which were soft rice paper rolls with shrimp, noodles and peanut sauce Also ordered was Pad Thai which was declared to be very good.  For main courses, Drunken Noodles were ordered and were excellent but considered a bit too spicy.  Sweet and Sour Pork came in manageable pieces and was also very tasty.  The Red Curry Chicken was excellent and had nicely balanced flavors.  Another of the group ordered Pad Prik King which was very good and had a wonderful sauce.   The Panang Curry was very good, but not spicy enough for one member of our party.  Other items ordered were the Chicken Satay and the Thai Delight.   It was generally agreed that service was excellent. The restaurant was nice and clean and restrooms were properly equipped and clean.  4 stars for excellent service, excellent food, and nice atmosphere.",

Just right amount of sourness and saltiness in this flavorful coconut soup base. All kinds of vegetables were included. I was surprised! And they have an option for cup sized soup, which a lot of places don't offer but perfect for a side dish for a single person! Awesome!  My entree was the eggplant dish with tofu, mild. Delicious! The flavor was a little bit on the strong side, but balanced perfectly with the relatively bland eggplant and tofu. Their rice was great too! You can tell if an Asian restaurant is good or bad just by tasting their rice, for it's such an important but skillful main dish for all Asian cuisine. They did a great job. I was really satisfied.  And before the check, my server brought me a small cup of coconut ice cream, and told me it was free for all their customers. I was sold! The ice cream was very tasty too, with pineapple and coconut pieces in it! My FAVORITE! Yum! I came here pretty late at night, but they never tried to rush me out the door, and treated me very politely and nicely instead. I'm very glad I came here tonight.  Overall, I had a very pleasant and satisfying dinner experience here. Thank you! I would highly recommend it if you're craving some great Asian food. I'll definitely come back again myself and maybe bring some friends with me as well.",

It was really tasty snd ordering it medium was the perfect \"hot\" for us. The ice cream was delicious too. Pineapple/coconut.  Easy access for handicapped and easy parking.  We will be back soon. Eat Local!!",

But I love Thai pork salad, so I gave them a chance to impressed me. And boy, did they! The take-out serving was huge, fresh, , herbal, salty, crunchy, tangy and spicy (I asked for level 2 and my mouth is still tingling). The only thing that threw me a little is the addition of short pieces of very chewy, thick noodles (think udon). I wasn't wild about that texture being added to the mix, but it certainly didn't affect the tastiness of the dish.  So now I can add one more dish to my list of sure bets at this restaurant.",

I typically get a Thai curry, with an appetizer and a dessert. I've tried most of their curries and they're really delicious. I've also tried their chicken satay, egg rolls, pot stickers and crab puffs. All of which are very nice. I really like their sticky rice and mango too. The staff and owner are always pleasant and often offer a water while you wait. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the prices feel a little high to me. And I've noticed a few times when the menu price was cheaper than what I was actually charged. But I love their food so I'll come back from time to time when I'm craving Thai food.",

I ordered the Drunken Noodles with shrimp and there was no hint of sauce whatsoever. It's like they forgot something. It was difficult to eat being that dry so I had to add my own sauce -- whatever was in my fridge and I did not have anything Thai or appropriate for this entree but it was better than nothing. Very disappointed in the drunken noodle dish. If I didn't order it to go, I would have returned it.  I also had a the glass noodle soup with vegetables and tofu. They did not provide enough broth so it wasn't really soup. The broth was flavorless and again, just seemed to be missing something. It tasted like plain water with no seasoning whatsoever, vegetables and clear noodles. Overall I was let down by the food. What kind of Thai restaurant has zero flavor in their food? I won't order from them in the future nor recommend this restaurant.   The good things: my order was ready when it was supposed to be, the meal came with a bottle of water which was a nice surprise hence the extra star, and the man who worked the register was nice. The restaurant seemed busy with a lot of pick up orders.",

The decor was modern and clean - not the typical Houston Chinatown hole in the wall.  It was a quiet night since at the end of our meal the chef and owner came out to the front of the house.  I chose a safe beef broccoli.  The meat quality was good and tasty.  The sauce was a little sweet for my liking.  Also my friend wasn't expecting her fish to be fried and the sauce was definitely sweet - it looked like sweet and sour.  Yelp check in a glass of thai tea made my friend's day after a long project workday.  I personally am meh about thai tea.  The complimentary coconut pineapple ice cream was a nice treat.  The bowl was iced to - it kept the ice cream really cold.  It is like an iced beer mug - it just makes the ice cream or beer tastier.  It was a good casual Thai meal while traveling for work.",

I got there around 6:30 on a Tuesday night, and there were a few customers inside, but things soon picked up, and they have a LOT of people coming in to pick up takeout!  Quick, friendly service with complimentary and tasty soup. I ordered chicken satay and beef Thai fried rice. It was all very good! I took about half of my fried rice home to enjoy later.   Very close to my house, reasonably priced and the restaurant was very clean, too. I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "I'm writing this as I sit here. I got here at 7:50pm and ordered food at around 8:00pm.    We ordered two appetizers, one soup, two entrees, and one drink.   It is now 8:27pm and one appetizer came out. We ate our appetizer pretty fast because we were famished. It is now 8:31pm and nothing else has come. The second appetizer came out at 8:35. We received the rest of our food at 8:43pm. We finished our meal, paid the bill, and left promptly at 9:01pm.   Generally, I am a very patient person. However, tonight, I was irritated. I do not understand how it took almost half an hour to receive two fried appetizers and a cup of soup. I was also annoyed that they forgot the drink. I also felt bad because the couple next to us was receiving the same level of \"service\" and their child was really hungry.   I have worked as a waiter in a similar restaurant of size and cuisine with the same number of staff members. Our average time from order to appetizer to entree was 5 minutes and 10 minutes.   This restaurant somehow managed 27 minutes to appetizer and 16 minutes to entrees. I'm not placing the full blame on the waiter. I'm placing blame on the entire establishment.   I will give credit that the food was good (note two stars instead of one) but it was accompanied by poor logistics, timing, and service. It was very disappointing and I have to say that I will not return.",

The moment we sat down it took around 5minutes for a waitress to come take our drink requests. We ordered the Tai Tea, it took another 15-20 min to receive our drinks. We decided to put on a timer the moment we got our teas and it took another 45minutes to receive our food. So prepare to have a LONG wait time when you come here.  The food was ok - Nothing special. the coconut shrimp has sweet coconut shavings that made it a little too sweet for my liking.The Chicken Pad Tai was good. and the drunken noodles were ok. The dishes were skimpy on meat so we got more noodles than meat. The spice is mild- so if you like spicy food make sure you order up a heat level.  The service was great and apologetic about the long wait time but it was still longer than what I was hoping for. I'd come here again someday but I wont be rushing to come here.",

A lot of the places around the valley seems to have dishes that use the same base for curries, which results in a dish that doesn't have too much of a flavor profile. My mom and I went here for lunch and ordered our regular dishes, chicken pad thai and red curry. I was expecting the standard flavor that these dishes have that I've experienced with other Thai restaurants, but to my surprise these dishes had a lot more flavor compared to other places. The vegetables were also very fresh and not overcooked. I think it's best to go during lunch because of the value and the great amount of food that comes along with it.",

My husband said the panang was good but he had better panang somewhere before. He felt the panang has more of coconut milk taste than the panang sauce in it. Lunch comes with soup, salad, and egg roll. They have a designated area where you grab your own soup and salad.

We ordered the spicy basil with chicken extra Thai hot and it did not disappoint! Wonderful flavor and the perfect amount of spice! We also got the phat prik khing in medium and it was so good and quite unique compared to others that I have had. I love how it came with a variety of vegetables. We also got a Thai iced tea that came free with our meal from our yelp check in! Finally, the owner brought us out two bowls of homemade coconut ice cream! It was so creamy and delicious and had little specs of pineapple throughout. What an amazing experience! We will definitely be back over and over I'm sure!",

The prices are extremely fair considering the quality and amount of food you get. The best part is that you are presented with a small bowl of coconut ice cream for desert.

To start, the service was on point!  Continual water fills( so important when you're eating spicy food), and nice friendly service from who I think was one of the owners(white guy with glasses).   I got the Pad See-ew and it was very good.  My two major complaints when I order this plate is too much sauce and not enough noodle.  I had neither of these problems!!   One more note, the spice level is True to description.  Which is great. Nothing more annoying then getting your Thai order milder then you wanted and than was advertised.   We will be back!",

I was in luck, my order was finished super quickly.  Inside I discovered that they also had Thai tea (a soft spot of mine!) and rushed off with my take-out to cram a quick dinner before other plans for the night. I was super hungry, and disappointed to say the least, as I carefully opened my styrofoam container, tied neatly in a plastic bag to find that napkins and eating utensils are not, apparently, included in the order. I was nowhere near silverware.   Aside from not being able to eat my dinner ... the place was cute, but completely empty at around 4pm on a Saturday. I saw one other person snag a takeout bag just before I walked in, and wondered why it was so empty. I assumed it must be because the little restaurant is tucked into a shopping mall area next in an area with lots of empty office space. When  I was finally able to eat, the noodles were decent but had lost much of their appeal after my quest to find a way to eat them.... trying first to use two plastic straws I happened to have in my car... and failing miserably. #fail.",

    "text": "I have been back many times, mostly when I get off work and feel like some Pad Thai (Thai comfort food for me) for takeout. With take out they give you a bottle of water which I feel is a nice touch for over the top customer service. Something almost all restaurants charge extra for.  Went back last week for lunch with a friend. This is the first time I've had lunch at Thai Delight. My friend had the Massaman Curry with chicken and I had Garlic and Pepper with chicken sliced (lunch menu shows ground chicken). My friend seems to enjoy her food by not saying much but her plate will be clean when finished. Lol  So I'm assuming she liked it. I loved my dish so much that I will order it again. It had lots of veggies, which I'm always looking for. A lot of places will only put the standard fare of carrots, peppers and onions. Whatever they put in the broth is divine! I think it's a hint of ginger. The pepper in the name comes from black pepper (I think). Even tho it's a lunch portion I took about half home (I'm not a light eater).  With lunch they had a soup and salad bar. The salad choices are limited so don't come expecting to fill up on it. Not sure if the soup changes, that day it was egg drop soup. I added greens onions to it from the salad bar. A spring roll accompanied our entree as well.  My total bill with a Thai Iced Tea was under $13. Stupid me, I checked in and forgot to redeem my free tea! Still good value for your buck.",

This place as far as I am concerned the best Thai food in AZ that I have found! The chicken satay is on spot! Most places don't take care on how they prepare this appetizer but they do. Even the cucumber-salad is really  good that comes with it. The peanut sauce was great as well. The staff is excellent and the owners came out to see how everything was. That means a lot to me and shows they really care about their guests! My wife loved her Pad See Yu and I tried it and it was excellent. Not dry like other places.   If you like Thai food try this place you won't be disappointed and you probably will fine it might be your favorite as well!!!!!",

    "text": "Overall probably the best dining experience of any thai place I have been to in the valley. The waiter was attentive, the place was small and cozy, but also very clean, and the food was above average. I enjoyed the environment and the fact that you didn't feel crowded in the area.  I ordered a dish of pad thai, with beef substitute. All said and done it was a quality meal with delicious ingredients. I had ordered the second spiciest level (4, out of a potential 5) but felt that it didn't hit the high notes of spiciness that I had expected. Aside from it being physically hot in temperature when brought to the table, once it cooled down I was able to dig into it without any sort of push back from the spices. So in that regard it left me a little uncertain of what to even expect in a subsequent visit should I order level 5.  I feel like maybe they're pulling punches to appeal to a more... European-descended clientele. In my past experiences with more robustly spiced thai food, I always end up bringing a large sized portion back with me because of the pacing that I go through to deal with the flavor sensations while eating.  You just sort of slow down when faced with high levels of spice, you know? Savoring it, processing the effects and the sensational highs, that sort of thing. Here, though, I breezed through most of the meal and left with only a tiny bit in styrofoam. And don't get me wrong: the portion size is GENEROUS, so I was able to eat quite a bit in one sitting. But, again, all of the ingredients were tasty, so having a full stomach of it was satisfying enough.  After the meal we were treated to complimentary coconut ice cream. It was really enjoyable and a great way to top off the meal and dining experience. All said and done, I can see this being a place that we come to monthly to scratch a thai itch, though I'm going to default to level 5 spiciness from now on.",

I really appreciate servers who are gifted with the ability to know when to approach the table and when to give space. Thanks Dee! I also really enjoy the music they play, it assists with the over all digestion of the experience, including the food! Their lunch specials are outstanding and the soups they offer at the lunch buffet are amazingggg! A+ all around. Delightful even!",

    "text": "We had an order delivered by Grubhub. Our order was Potstickers, Thai Fried Rice and Pad Woon Sen.  the potstickers were the only acceptable item   The fried rice had zero flavor and the veggies were over cooked and mushy. Also there where some unknown hard little bits in the dish.   The Pad Woon Sen was just bad. The snap peas were so mushy it was disgusting, all the other veggies were over cooked and mushy and once again there was some unknown hard bit.   However none of the above is the purpose of this review. We had been here before and had great food and service. We called in our experience with the food and were pot on hold for quite a while and then the person on the phone told us to call GrubHub for a refund. Ummmmmm..... we should waste more of our time to make this right? No that's your job. We told her that is not our job but thank you we will not be coming back or ordering from here again. So disappointed!!!!!",

    "text": "I cannot express enough how much I love to eat here!  I generally do takeout as I live close to the restaurant and my order is ready in 10-15 minutes and is always hot - temperature hot, because I get no spice/mild.  I have grown to become quite intolerant to spicy dishes and in this review that is important to note, because a lot of Thai places do not have control over spice level consistently and often cook no spice/mild dishes in the same pans as previous spicy orders which ruins the no spice/mild dishes.  I have had several items from the menu and have never once had my food come out with another dish's leftover spice level.  In the two months that I have lived in the area, I have eaten here at least once a week - and will certainly continue to do so based on the quality level of the food and the amazing service provided by the entire staff.  They have a way of really making one feel right at home and welcome!  Thank you Thai Delight staff! ~Sandi",

We went on a weekday for dinner, it's a small place and it wasn't even packed. The person who took our order was very nice and quick. But then we had to wait for almost 45 mins for our food to come which got a bit annoying and that's why not more stars. We did not get any update on the order or that food will take time. I ordered the drunken noodles with veggies - medium spicy and it looked really good. Once we started eating the heat started kicking in and not just for me but everyone found it too spicy. The veggies and noodles had a great flavor but unfortunately the spice level was so high that after a point I couldn't taste anything but spices. I had to order a Thai Ice tea to cool down but that didn't help much. I just wish the wait wasn't that long and food wasn't too spicy so that we could enjoy the experience and the food more.",

I've tried the drunken noodle chicken and pad Thai chicken here. The portions for lunch are dinner are very large! I can't even finish the lunch portion by myself!  The food is very authentic and the owners are polite. It's a husband and wife business.  The Thai tea is sweet and creamy! It comes in a large cup!  Prices for entrees range from $7.95 to $9.95, that's pretty good.   Stop in for some delicious food!",

The \"medium\" spicy was relatively mild, so I'll go up a notch next time, but the level of spice is always subjective, especially with Thai food. I'd rather get something too mild and spice it up myself than not be able to finish it.   Glad Thai Delight is one of my local options!",

The green curry with chicken was very good, with just the right heat (ordered a 3). A friend ordered a noodle dish that she was slightly disappointed in. Overall I would recommend to try.",

If you're a ginger lover, you'll thoroughly enjoy this dish. There was fresh ginger all throughout the dish. It also came with rice.   Also got the Hawaiian beef. This dish was flavorful and filled with sweet chunks of pineapple throughout.   Lastly, there was a surprise treat at the end. Complimentary coconut ice cream. Wow. What a nice touch.

I feel like California spoiled me with any Asian cuisine so I was happy to find my expectations beyond exceeded with this place.  I was craving yellow curry and this was exactly what I was looking for-- the flavor was spot on and it was enough food for a few rounds of meals for a pretty inexpensive cost.  My boyfriend ordered the pad see ew (extra spicy, although warned), it was his first Thai food experience, and he loved it.  The flavors were even better the next day.  With my check in, I received a free Thai iced tea and the woman at the counter was so accommodating in making it last minute.  This will be our go to spot for Thai food from now on!",

It was a bad experience and I don't know why I didn't update my review at that time. I should have.  Arriving around 8, I observed the place had no diners seated.   The reason for my bad experience was that, the spice level on my first visit was wimpy. So, we opted for \"Thai hot.\" That was treated by, \"you ordered it and you can't ask to give it back,\" said to us before the order was done. Well, I think the cook decided to show this caucasian diner what was what for some reason. The table next to us was already making a fuss about the meal being inedible because of the spice level. The server just said, \"you ordered, no take back.\" We got pure chili spice and the only \"flavor\" was fire.  That recollection and the empty dining room had us spinning on our heels.  I guess if you like Asain food with zero spice, you'll like it here. Once again I find myself having been too generous with my first reaction.  I've travelled to Thailand and all over Asia. It's possible to get spicy hot with amazing flavor profiles.   Now I'll remember to give this place a pass.",

Now, we've primarily \"taken-out\" so we can't always rate atmosphere or service, but we definitely have a string handle on the food. This place is the best in the area. Why? And why only 4 stars? Read on.  Food: The food is excellent. Extremely large portions, very well spiced and heat appropriate. Super flavorful (this is huge for me, it is not bland or boring, and not mainstream blah-Thai like other restaurants), authentic and fresh with appropriate seasonings. Price is about the same as every other Thai restaurant in the area, give or take a dollar or two. Because of the size, we always get two meals out of each entree, this is great.  Although we haven't eaten on-site, when we go inside to pick up, it's easy to see that the atmosphere is very nice. It's modern and clean and spacious and comfortable.  So, why only 4 stars? Each time we've ordered take out over the phone from Thai Delight, the time is *always* longer than what they quote, not by a couple minutes, usually by 15 to 20 minutes, which means, the food takes approximately 40 minutes to be ready. This wouldn't be a huge issue if that's what you're told up front, but when you're told \"20 minutes\" and you show up 20 minutes later, then wait another 20 minutes, consistently, that can get a bit frustrating. Fortunately, after the first bite or two, it's so good that the frustration dissipates. This could be easily addressed and made better with an apology or even an acknowledgment from the staff. They lose a full rating star for this, not because it happened once, but because it's a regular occurrence and we haven't seen any improvement in this process.  Would I recommend Thai Delight? Yes, absolutely! If you're phoning in an order to go, just be prepared that the wait time they quoteyou may be quite a bit longer. Give yourself a bit of extra time if you are really hungry. Definitely our favorite Thai food in and around Ahwatukee.",

Their menu offers many of the Thailand flavors along with soups full of flavor and apps that won't disappoint. Caution to those that love the spice. My advice is to start low and work your way up. I love spicy food and three stars is about the top of my tolerance scale. They can put fire in your belly  if you want them to, but what's the point? Life is a balance after all and enjoying the food.   Their sampler is an opportunity to taste the various apps. Chicken satay is good and hot with a good coating of spices. Drunken noodle and Thai fried rice is always good. They're full of veggies with a generous portion of large white chicken meat.  Well worth what you pay for and what you get.",

We were seated immediately and this place looks clean and modern. They have a salad and soup bar, the salad bar had some fresh berries and grapes which is a rare find in Thai restaurants.  I ordered a bowl of tom Kha soup and panang curry. The curry came with an option of white or fried rice. The tom Kha soup is one of the best I have tried. Their coconut milk used was on point, so was the flavor in it with the chicken well done. My favourite dish of the day was definitely the panang curry, it was hot and was really fresh. The curry was delicious with the side of fried rice. I went with a spice level of 3 and it was just perfect. It came along with spring roll which was equally appetizing. I enjoyed the meal to every bit.  The lunch portion was excellent and so is their price. With the delicious food they serve, the price is decent. This place is definitely on the top of my rotation.",

This place is amazing! The food and ingredients were so fresh. The spice level was exactly what I expected in the numbers. Definitely ordering from here again!   **no photos as hunger came first and at this point if I took a photo I'd be both embarrassed and proud of the carnage lol**",

    "text": "OK you can choose to believe me or not - but this is the BEST Thai food I've ever had. And I've had Thai food all over the Northwest (new to the area and happened upon this place! What luck).   The Tom Kha is spiced beautifully. You can tell the ingrediants such as lemongrass and coconut milk are fresh and correctly sourced. I love the texture of the cabbage. The shrimp is SO good - totally mild !! No weird \"fishy\" or grimy taste/texture that I can't stand about some restaurant's shrimp.  Now the green curry - *Wow* so healthy. My mouth dropped when I saw they added eggplant! An often ignored ingredient that I think should be a default. And it just contained a ton of vegetables packed in there which I love. The curry itself is SO rich and fantastic.  This is gonna be my new Thai spot in Phoenix, for sure.",

Be aware, the entrees are large (can easily feed at least two people if not more)   If you check in through Yelp, you get an Xl glass of iced Thai tea or Thai coffee. Yum! Very nice bonus   Customer-wise, it was a good mix of Asians and non-Asians. I think that is a very good sign for any eatery.  We ordered-- 1) the appetizer plate called Thai Delight--coconut shrimp, crab Rangoon, fried rolls, fresh roll, chicken satay, two each. Good flavors, only that the various sauces Can be a little more flavored.   2) the Drunken Spaghetti with Seafood (one of the house specialities)--hubby said it had a good balance of veggies, spaghetti and seafood. He was pleased with it.   3) the Pad Thai (how can I not)--traditional shrimp and chicken but you can switch out to other meats if you like. It became better after I asked for a whole extra lime to squeeze onto it (they charged me a dollar for the lime), and after I requested to have the fish sauce brought to our table (watch it though--their fish sauce had chilis in it, which I did not expect).   Not related to the food or the service but just be aware that when we had dinner there today (Nov 3rd, 2018), a customer got locked in in the bathroom since the doorknob mechanism probably got stuck. It took about 15 minutes to get unstuck by one of the kitchen staff members--bless him! All I'm saying is, better check and double check that the door won't get stuck when you decide to enter the restroom...  Final verdict--we would return",

    "text": "My first time trying Thai Delight and I'm a fan!  I arrived around 11:40 today, hoping to beat the lunch crowd.  When I arrived I was the only guest in the restaurant, maybe the first guest of the day because they opened at 11.  I was greeted immediately.  While dining, business picked up a bit, 7 more people came in. There was plenty of available seating.   Similar to other Thai restaurants, Thai Delight offers free and unlimited hot soup and salad to accompany your meals.  The salad bar is slightly different.  It's just regular toss salad but they also have tomatoes, cucumbers, green onions, strawberries and grapes.  How nice?!  They did not have the peanut dressing most are used to.  Instead there salad bar comes with some sort of Thai Vinaigrette maybe.  It's delicious.  I had 2 servings.  The soup also taste a lot fresher than other Thai places I've tried.  Some Thai soup taste like it's loaded with soy and sodium to me.  This soup did not!  I ordered the L3 - Pad Thai.  I keep it simple! The portions were HUGE.  I can't imagine what the dinner portions are like (see pics). Again, the food didn't taste like it was loaded with soy and sodium.  No after taste from the eggs and chicken (which is what I've experienced at other places). I opted for level 1 for my spice level - it was perfect.  So was the spring roll that accommodated my meal.   I was in and out, full and pleased within 40 minutes.  Probably could have been sooner but I sat and enjoyed another helping of salad before I left.  I also used my check it offer and got a free Thai Tea (large).  I've never tried Thai Tea because I didn't' like the idea of milk I my tea but I rarely decline a free check in offer   I noticed on the menu it said if you want more OR less ice in your Thai Tea, it'll be an extra dollar.  Really?!   All of this goodness cost me less than 9 bucks (without the tip) and I have leftovers for dinner this evening or lunch tomorrow.  I would most certainly go back, next time I'm bringing friends.",

    "text": "My husband took me here the past couple of weeks after he stumbled upon it during their grand opening week.  He kept raving how great it was, and I was at first a bit skeptical because I have my usual favorite Thai spot.  But he was definitely right! I ordered my usual meal of a vegetable medley with some type of meat covered in garlic sauce.  It's called Mixed Vegetables Delite at this location.  And with me currently being pregnant, I got it at a mild spice level. It was absolutely delicious!  The dish had just the right amount of sauce to be flavorful, without it being too soup-y.  It came with a side of rice so it was nice to mix it all in get some of the sauce on the rice.  The spice level was just perfect for me!  Although I\"m not sure I would categorize it as mild....although it could just be the pregnancy talking.  It had a small kick to it, which is what I was looking for!  But for those who hate spice and want the lowest spice setting, I think the mild still might be a bit too much.  But like I said, my taste buds have been a bit out of wack lately. My husband ordered the Pad Thai both times we went, so I can only assume it must be amazing!  I tried a small bit of the tofu and it was great!  A bit crispy on the outside, but had the normal soft texture on the inside.  It was flavored so well that my husband didn't even realize it was tofu LOL.  He thought it might have been some scallop or type of seafood. HAH!   They also give you a small bowl of coconut ice cream, although I'm not sure if this is the norm, a lunch special, or just a random act of kindness.  But it definitely helped complete our meal and the coconut was not too overpowering, which I loved! We will definitely be making this our usual spot from now on!",

The service was authentic and genuine. Not rushed and really attentive. And the food was outstanding. Hubby got the pineapple fried rice and I got the panang chicken curry both medium and was it spicy but not burn your face off. We also ordered the fresh spring rolls which were very good, peanut sauce not the best that I've ever had but good. We ordered mango and sweet rice for dessert which was delicious. They gave us complimentary cup or coconut ice cream with mango which was absolutely amazing. Creamy and refreshing after a spicy meal. Only down side according to my better half is they serve Pepsi product and he's a Dt. Coke guy. He needs more water in his life so he dealt with it. Great place, lots of options and spice levels for every palate.  We'll definitely be going back! So glad to have another Thai house in the neighborhood!",

    "text": "Encouraged by all the 5 star reviews, we decided to check this place out. There was no wait and the atmosphere is cute, but beyond that, there's not much I can say about it that's positive. Ok, so first we ordered the fresh rolls and it was literally a bunch of store bought salad mix stuffed into rice paper wrappers with some unseasoned tofu. Hardly any mint or noodles to be found either, so yeah. I brought this to our servers attention, and instead of offering to take it off the bill (which would have been the right thing to do) she tried to convince us that it's authentic and every restaurant does it differently.  My dad got their wonton soup, which was way too salty, and ended up having to throw a bunch of the lettuce from the previously mentioned rolls in it just to make it palatable. After a few bites he decided to take the rest home cause he could fix it at least  For his main course he ordered the mango curry with duck. Our server assured him it was mild in term of spiciness because he told her he didn't want anything too spicy. Well, not only was this dish really spicy, but the curry sauce was way too sweet- it seems they used mango syrup rather than fresh mango to make it. I didn't try the duck as I don't eat meat, but he was concerned about it's freshness since the sauce was so sweet and spicy that it was impossible to tell  As for myself, I ordered the pad woon sen with tofu. I love pad woon sen, and have had many in my lifetime. Sadly, this one was terrible. Greasy, overcooked (noodles and vegetables both) and the sauce was terrible.   I should also mention that at no point during the meal did our server ask us how our food was.   Both of us hardly ate our entrees, and as much as I hate wasting food, I knew I wouldn't end up eating it if I took it home and my dad wasn't up to making what would be a monumental effort to fix his dish (plus he was uncertain as to whether the duck was fresh)  When we informed our server that we didn't want to pack any of the entrees to go, she didn't say anything. Two nearly untouched entrees and no attempt to find out why.  Honestly we should have been paid to eat this subpar food rather than paying them for it!  I love Thai food and have never been to a bad Thai restaurant in my life, but I guess there's a first time for everything.",

I have been ordering everything at a level FIVE, which is their spiciest level.  One day it was phenomenal and I could not stop eating it.  The next two times, it was actually a bit hotter than expected.  Still, I am addicted to the heat!  I keep going back for more because it is amazing.  So far, I have had the Pad Thai, the Drunken Noodles and the Garlic Noodles.  I like the Drunken Noodles the best, so I have ordered those on repeat visits.  If you go during lunch time, you get salad bar included.  I think they also have soup, but I have never tried it.  My daughter likes the grapes they have in the salad bar.  Thai Delight is reasonably priced.  Most of what I get is $7.95 during lunch and $9.95 at dinner.  Considering I get two meals out of it most of the time, it is a definite bargain!  The restaurant has only been open for a few months, but already seems to have a loyal following.  That said, they were empty on Friday night.  I felt really bad that we were one of only two or three tables in there.    They even brought us coconut pineapple ice cream for dessert, which happens to be my absolute favorite ice cream from childhood!  They have earned my business for sure!  I urge you to go to Thai Delight when you are in Ahwatukee for some awesome food.  It is way better than the Ahwatukee Thai Basil and service is way friendlier, too!",

It's what I imagine a Gumby toy would feel like, if it were marinated in peanut sauce and grilled at a low temp for a few hours. There's quite a few other options in the area for much better quality meat and ingredients.",

The owners, Kung and Mike, we're attentive and made us feel at home.  Our waiter Carlo was always on the spot with water and Pepsi refills and generraly provided great service.   I highly recommend Thai Delight to all Thai and anyone wanting to experience an amazing and authentic Thai meal.",

    "text": "FINALLY!! After just about a year of living in Phoenix, I found my go-to Thai place! Moving here from the North East, I wanted - no, NEEDED to find a Thai place that I could treat myself to every once and experience the amazing flavors of Thai food. After searching far and wide, being disappointed time and time again, I finally found Thai Delight.  The pictures looked promising, and the reviews were positive. But a taste test was needed to see if it had what it takes to be my #1 go to thai place.  The first time I came here for dinner when moving into my new apartment. I got the spicy basil fried rice with beef. Let me tell you, they do not skimp out on the meat here. There was a lot of meat and it was very tender and good! There's also a lot of vegetables. Actually, there's just a whole lot of everything, since the portions are huge! The price is right, too, just around $10 or so for the dish (based on your protein choice).   My boyfriend got the drunken noodles. He really loved them, but he likes 0 spice so when I tried it I thought they were good, but not to my liking. Thankfully I tried them the second time we came and got the right amount of spice for me and they were great! The dishes have such a deep flavor that makes me want more and more.  The first time we went, we got the spring roll appetizer. The server (who I think may also be the owner) made them without mint for me, since I don't like it. They were really good. They come with two sauces: one is sweet and a more thin sauce, and the other is a peanut sauce that is very thick. Although I didn't love either of them on their own, I found that oddly enough mixing them made it the perfect taste.  The second time we went was during lunch. They have soup (I'm not sure exactly what kind, I think it was like an egg drop soup?) and a salad bar. I got a plate of salad, and the dressing was the same thin sweet sauce from the spring rolls, so I didn't love that. There were also grapes and cherries so I got a whole bowl full of cherries! My boyfriend got the soup too which tasted amazing, but unfortunately I forgot to grab a cup before leaving.  Overall, with this place being right down the street from me (literally... walking distance), I will be back many, many times. The prices are fair, the portions are huge, they don't skimp on anything in their dishes, and the service is very attentive. I'm so glad that I found this place and I can't wait to get it again!",

They put the Clemson vs Alabama College \"Passball\" championship game for me. I was happy Clemson won and even more happier since my server was gorgeous!  This time...not so much.  My server was nothing short of bipolar.  I walked in and she greeted me like she had missed me!  Lol. \"Where have you been?\" She asked.  I ordered water and a Thai Iced tea. I told her I would need a minute to order.  When she came back I ordered the Shrimp and chicken fried rice! Medium spice.  A True work of Art!  Battery low so I couldn't take a pic.  Anyway I showed her the yelp free Thai tea check in and she rambled something about her customers this and customers that....allow me to back track a little.  When I ordered the Pinapple Chicken AND shrimp fried rice she says \"That comes with 2 shrimp\".  I said 2 shrimp?  She again rambled about that because shrimp is more expensive they only put 2 and because it's not just the chicken order there is less chicken...LOL.  So I had to ask.  But it's not just 2 pieces of chicken right?  I just realized that I took up a table for 4 and it was busier than normal.  Maybe that's why the attitude.  She never came back to ask if everything was good or to refill my water.  The food is amazing!  The coconut ice cream is the perfect complementary touch (given to me by another server.) The attitude made me uncomfortable to day the least.  Please bring back that beautiful Thai girl!!!  Otherwise, you lost me as a customer.  I gave 3 stars based on the portion and quality of food.  I still tipped 20% for the cooks who know their craft.  I won't be coming back here but you should!  Again, the food is A+",

The basil flavor was not popping, and the noodles were slightly overdone.  Till we meet again, Thai Delight.",
