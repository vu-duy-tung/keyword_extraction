We asked for medium spice and the dishes were very mild. We used to think that this was a 5 star place. Not anymore !!!",

    "text": "We originally discovered Suh Noi through GrubHub, and were thrilled with the quality of their take-out food! It turned out to be right around the corner from us, so we decided (after ordering it a half a dozen times) to finally go in and check it out.  The building is small and has a drive through window, but don't let that fool you! The place is actually really nice!! They include nice glassware and place-settings on each of the tables, and in prettier weather, their trendy outdoor area looked like it would be a cozy, fun place to hang out.  As far as food goes, I have my favorites for sure. The Dragon Egg (steamed) appetizer is wonderful! If you're not much for spicy food, just take the jalapenos off and they're fine. I believe that there are six to an order, and my boyfriend and I usually polish them off together. (It's sort of like a delicious, moist meatball in a dumpling! So good!!!) My usual main-course is the Pad Thai, which I like to get extra spicy! The flavor is great, and I love that they serve it with some raw veggies that give it a great texture. My only complaint would be the size of the hunks of chicken. If they cut those down a bit, it would be easier to eat with chopsticks and you'd get some chicken in more of your bites. (Right quantity, wrong size.) That said, it's still great!!! My boyfriend usually goes for a chicken and veggies dish, and he's never had any complaints. Of course, the chicken egg rolls are awesome, and a favorite we often order too... As you can imagine, with all of this food, we almost always have a meal for the next day!!   Overall, we were really impressed by this unexpectedly trendy spot! If you're looking for something quick and delicious, check it out one evening. If you have a little more time, they offer some decent wines too.",

This location is low on parking but, not a deal breaker and most of the time not a problem. Plus, if you do end up walking a little you'll have room for the chocolate cake ;)",

    "text": "What an adorable place! And after the place has been void of a business for sometime, it's about time.  THE PLACE: Adorable decor. Quite appropriate for a little Asian diner with a  modern feel to it. Some one really loves Anime, as you will see murals and Anime posters and photos of cosplayers.  Parking, not an issue, there's plenty of parking. Can't dine in? Order your food to go through the pick-up window. You can even call ahead and just pick up your food at the drive through. You can see the ladies working the kitchen, and I observe the place to be quite clean. Not sure about the restroom though, as I was only there to pick-up our take-away food.  THE SERVICE: We phoned in our order. We were told our order would be ready for pick-up in 15 minutes, and that we can pick it up at the drive thru window. I thought that was really neat.  As we have never been here before, we decided to come down and pick-up the food. The young lady who took my  order via phone rang us up, and I added a Thai Tea to go. As she was the only one manning the front of the store, we waited a few minutes before we could get the Thai Tea as she had to assist other customers. Overall, it was alright with us, but I caution that she may need additional help, during busy times.  THE FOOD: We ordered for 2 Candy Chicken Combos with Tom Ka Gai, 2 Yellow Curry Combos with Tom Ka Gai and 1 Pad Thai. Truthfully, it was just okay. The Candy Chicken which was given much praise by other reviewers due to the plum sauce, was not what I expected. The plum sauce was more like an overly sweet chili sauce. The curry, was a bit watered down from what we were accustomed to. The Pad Thai was alright. It tasted quite fine, but I do have to say, I've had better at other establishments with a comparable price range.  Will I come back? Sure! I would like to try other items at the place. Hey, I'm hopeful I would be better impressed at the next visit and would have to update this review. Go small businesses!",

They also do a combo meal so you can get the soup on the side with once of the curries. If you are looking for a caffeine kick the thai tea and coffee hit the spot. They also have a drive through, i would call ahead for big orders although it probably only tool them 20 minutes to get my order ready.",

    "text": "My husband and I went for dinner a couple of days ago.   He had the vegetarian fried rice and I had the Tom Ki Gai soup.   Both were pretty good, but don't expect anything extra.   My husband wanted an extra fried egg and was told they couldn't to that.   He asked if they had eggs,  and was told yes but they couldn't fry one up for him even if he paid extra.   So it was they wouldn't, not that they couldn't.   He then asked if he could get a small side of the yellow curry sauce and again he was told that they couldn't do that either.   If he wanted the yellow curry sauce, he had to order the complete dish.  So while the food was fine,  the service was not.   It is another case where service lags and where the restaurant only gives what they want and is not interested in serving their customers in excellence.",

I decided to ask if they could tailor their no no pad thai for me, and they did.  It was amazing.  I wish I had more healthy options in this area, but now I have an awesome healthy option right down the street.  This place is great for take out, but if you do sit down, try their strawberry boba cocktail!  It is not traditional tapioca, it has bursts of strawberry in bubbles, it is so good!

Every dish ordered was fresh, tasty and just what we hoped.  Dragon eggs are wonderful with large portions of shrimp, pork and crab.  The crab island appetizer is served cold and stuffed into a crisp wonton.  The crab ingredients were wonderful.  Both items are highly recommended and we will order them again in the future.  Main entrees were happily customized in terms of spiciness and the best ingredients were used for each entree.  Chicken pad Thai, Holy Basil, Candy chicken and the peanut dish with peanut sauce were outstanding.  Holy Basil was spicey yet our guest enjoyed all she could eat.  Our server offered to prepare something else in lieu of the spicey dish but our guest was happy to enjoy what she was served.  Great atmosphere, pleasant staff, fresh food enjoyed by all!  Thank you, Suh Noi. We will be back.",

It's pretty convenient to get to from my apartment and the drive through window to pick up the to go orders is super nice to not have to run in.    I always get the glass noodles with chicken and they always have such good flavor. I'm a huge spice person and the spicier the better for me.  Whenever I call to order they are pretty right on for the time estimate and there isn't usually a line of cars or anything. Definitely recommend for Thai in the area.",

Parking spots are in the rear. When I went in to pay, their iPad started doing an update and they couldn't process the transaction. It took the girls several minutes trying to figure it out before I just decided to give them my cash and not get any change in return. They need a second computer!  Aside from that slight inconvenience, the food was phenomenal! I had the curry and the flavor was outstanding. And all at a reasonably price tag.",

The Mee Krob was good at first, but it was also very sweet and made for a wearing dish. I could only eat a small amount as the sugar was a little overwhelming for me, I wouldn't order this again. The fresh rolls were indeed fresh as well as delicious and healthy. I've had these at Wild Thaiger and they tasted the same, just as good as I remember. The panang was a bit spicy and very authentic. You could taste every flavor and could tell they didn't skimp with the proper ingredients as a lot of other Thai places do. Service was great too, our server really knew the menu and was great at explaining the dishes to everyone. I will definitely return to try more of the menu, but it will be really hard to stray from that panang.",

When I lived in downtown phx, my favorite Thai restaurant was wild thaiger. Now I am able to get awesome food at just a stones throw.   This spot is tiny. There are about 5 tables and a quaint outdoor patio. The decor is interesting and modern. Bright white, cool lighting, pink details.   The food is wonderful. I would highly recommend the pad sea ewe. It is some of the best I've ever had. We also got the dragon eggs appetizer and it was OKAY. I was a little underwhelmed with the flavor.  Note: the lunch specials are only valid mon-fri   I am interested in going back in the evening maybe getting a few beers and sitting on the patio.   I will be back many times.",

I could taste the kafir lime leaves, lemon grass, Thai basil, and coconut milk all singing, because it was so fresh.  The service was unassuming and the restaurant clean and pleasant.

The menu is small compared to other Thai places but they also serve some unique foods too. You order at the register and seat yourself.   Based on what we had they are deserving of at least 4 stars as the food really was very good.  In both dishes we tried the meats were cooked nicely and the dishes actually had enough basil.   I had the Holy Basil Chicken. The chicken was tender and this dish had enough basil to make it taste good. This dish ran much hotter than I was expecting and I almost couldn't eat it. I ordered it very hot. About 1/2 of other Thai places don't make very hot that hot and I'm usually left wanting more heat but NOT THIS TIME. I'm not the biggest fan of jalapenos in Thai Food but it's such a big deal to find a place that uses Holy Basil I got it anyway.   My husband had a similar dish the Wild Boar Grapao. This dish is made more the way I like. The meat was hand chopped in a similar but slightly different sauce with Thai Basil and Thai Chili's. The very hot in this dish was mild compared to the Holy Basil Chicken but was spicy. For $1.50 extra you have the option to have your dish Thai Style with a fried egg.  Very good and above average for sure.",

There were probably only about maybe 6 parking spots and I was lucky enough to find an empty one, not sure if they had other spots available.   When we came in, there were 2 servers and no one said anything for a couple minutes so we decided to just grab a seat. It took them a while to come up to us too and mind you there were only 4 other customers in the restaurant.   We ordered the Tom ka gai, Mu Yang and pad Thai. Wow...  their tom ka gai, (coconut soup) was so good! I always order that in Thai restaurants and theirs is definitely one of the best I've had. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The flavors are one point. You need it order it no matter what! The pad Thai was good too. Guy Fieri tried the Mu yang (pork skewers) so of course we had to try it! It came with 3 skewers -- They were good, but honestly I've had better bbq pork before.   I would give 4.5 stars for their food, the flavor was amazing! I felt like I had a home cooked meal! But the service really turned me off. She barely refilled my water, barely checked on us. I felt like I waited around for my food to come, and I can see it in the kitchen, waiting for her to serve it to us. Definitely won't be coming back to dine in, but will just order take out for next time.",

    "text": "I give Suh Noi's food taste 4 stars, service 1 star, so 2.5 stars is my rating. I did not like Thai food enough to go to a Thai restaurant.  When I was in Thailand for 6 weeks, I could not eat the Thai food, cos it was too hot and gave me serious diarrhea enough to cause me to lose 12 lbs when I came back to USA.  I had to eat Australian and Italian food in Thailand.    But I went with a Greater Phoenix Ethnic Lunch MeetUp to Suh Noi because people said it was so good, and it was so close to my house (about 3 miles).  I ordered the fried catfish ($13).   It was SOOOOOOO GOOD, I am rather obsessing over it.  People said the lunch special soup was so good.  I wanna go to Suh Noi again to have lunch special which includes the soup.  We had 12 in our MeetUp for lunch party for 1 pm on Thurs.  There were only 2 other occupied tables, one with 2 people, other with 3.  I felt the service was bad, like the reviews said.  They could not serve all of us about the same time.  Some of us got our food 40 min after others got their entrees, and we kept telling the server that we were so hungry, when is our food coming.  Soon Soon.    It's coming!   Of course people in our party were done eating, when others were still waiting for their entrees (me!  I was last person to get my order).    I looked at my watch.  By the time I got my order, I had been sitting in that restaurant for an hour.   Furthermore, I observed that the other tables had already turned over twice, and they came later than we did, and got their food sooner, and then ate and left, before some of us in our party (ME !) even got our food.  Made me \"jealous\", cos I was so hungry.    Also I asked for a dish of lemon wedges (for me to make lemonade) and I think it took 20 min and reminding, to get my lemon wedges, which meant I did not drink my water, cos I was waiting for my lemon wedges.    I think if Suh Noi could have great service, they would be one of those rare 5 star restaurants that I give.    But the fried catfish was SOOOO GOOD and I felt they gave me a lot of fish, too, the portion was generous!    I later went back on another day and ordered the lunch special.  I felt the portion was very small for the price, compared to another new Thai restaurant Thai Long-An.  3 stars for Suh Noi's lunch special.    Parking is very limited, but you can park in horseshoe around the sides and back of the building, even though it says No Parking.",

If they got rid of the TV on the wall and somehow closed off the bar and open kitchen a bit more it would be even more intimate. The drink cooler to the left of the bar brings down the casualness to an incongruous level with the dining room.  We tried the Mu Yuang and the De-Cha Boar and both were delicious although wildly different.  The wild boar was a little chewy and reminded us of a slow stewed very intensely flavored dish with lots of chilis, Asian string beans, onions and sweet peppers. It had a very strong garlic and chili flavor that complemented the boar.  The grilled pork skewers (three) served with the sticky rice and papaya salad was the better of the two dishes. The pork was very tender with strong grill flavor and a delicious green chili spicy dipping sauce that was also slightly sweet and we actually we poured it onto the wild boar dish and it lightened it up quite a bit.  We didn't try to dumplings or noodle dishes but will in the future.   The service was a little scattered from our vantage point at the bar and we probably would not have noticed if we had sat at a table. They do a strong carryout business.",

In fact, you can order ahead of time and pick up via drive-through. Better though, it also has a few nice seats and tables inside.   The food is authentic and flavorful. We ordered papaya salad, Tom Yum soup (spicy/sour soup with mushrooms and shrimps), Pad See Ew (stir fried noodles), and sticky rice. The shrimps in tom yum soup were big and fresh. The Pad See Ew was on the sweet side, which we are not used to. In some Thai restaurants, we have experienced \"old\" oil in the stir fried noodles. Thaiger doesn't have such a problem and the wide noodles were yummy and well-cooked. The sticky rice was served with coconut sauce on the top, a nice, sweet surprise.   Overall, great food but a bit on the pricey side (given the location and atmosphere).",

This place is a jewel of a find for Foodies searching out new and exciting venues.  Everything in this place is new and different.  The artwork on the wall is not the same old touristy Thai artifacts but hand painted animes and paintings.  The furniture is white modern with white couches surrounding a smallish TV.  The waitress was a walking anime, half Thai (perfect English) and family.      Wine selection is small but nice, like the restaurant itself.  It is a small place as the name implies, catering to local takeout but with a nice, local crowd.  The food is the best Thai I have ever eaten.  The fresh spring rolls were a meal unto themselves and the Pad Thai has been voted Best in The Valley. Pad Thai was about the only traditional thing on the menu, everything else is new and exciting or twists on the old favorites.  Cannot say enough good things about this place   <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.littlethaiger.com&s=f92838aef32e83adfabac14fa64071878120ba5d3005967e40c817bd0f226c9d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">littlethaiger.com</a>",

If you've ever had the pleasure of eating at Wild Thaiger in Downtown Phoenix, you'll be familiar with the deliciousness being served at Suh Noi The Little Thaiger; same chef/owner, same menu. This place is proof that great things come in small packages. Everything is delicious. I want to write this review in all caps because I feel like screaming it from the rooftops! This chef/owner knows Thai cuisine like the back of her hand, and she uses all the glorious flavors of Thailand and whips them into something incredibly tasty and beautiful! She truly is an artist.   I always (always) order a Freshie Roll and Dragon eggs (served steamed or crispy). These appetizers are my absolute favorites and I refuse to go without them!   My favorite entrees are the Mu Yang (marinated pork skewers served with sticky rice & papaya salad), the Peanut Passion (chicken breast smothered in Thai peanut sauce, served with a flavorful veggie medley and jasmine rice) and the Pad Sie Ew (fat egg noodle, pork or chicken, stir fried veggies in a sweet soy).   I'll stop rambling, but do yourself a major favor and go. The service is always friendly and accommodating and the food has never once disappointed me. I bring all my favorite people here for a reason.",

The ambiance is pretty casual, with a few TVs running and anime decor everywhere. However, you are served by a waitress, and the food is so good you'd think you're somewhere much fancier!   I got the peanut passion, which is chicken with veggies and peanut sauce. It was so yummy, perfect with a Thai iced tea. A few of my friends got the pad Thai and said it was awesome. I want to come back to try a hot pot, too. Everything is really reasonably priced.   They have a little drive up window, which you can use by calling ahead and then driving-thru to pick it up.

The Catfish Prigking was ok, nothing special. My friend had the Seafood Panang and as a chef he thought it was excellent. The ambience is nice and relaxing, love the led flower  blossom trees. It's not to large inside, they have a patio as well. Staff was friendly and welcoming. This is now tied with SumoMaya as my two favorite restaurants in Arizona, if you have been to SumoMaya for me to compare this place you know you have to come try it now, you'll be happy you did!  *the next day* Just had the left over Catfish by it self and it was great! So Much better then it being OK like I thought it was yesterday. I think I first found it to be just OK yesterday is cause I was eating it at the same time as the epically fantastic dishes.",

    "text": "After seeing several good reviews on this establishment we decided to try The Little Thaiger. The parking lot was extremely small, and it was difficult to determine whether we could park along the sides of the business that have red painted curbs indicative of a fire lane. The inside of the facility was nice. The waitstaff was very attentive to us, and provided good service.  We had Dragon Eggz for an appetizer, and they were OK at best. I had two of these dumplings. One was good, but the other was terrible because of several crunchy pieces in there (gristle, shells, or something else?).   The papaya salad was also ordered for the table. The response on this item was that it was lacking flavor. I did not have any of this item.  For the entrees our table ordered fresh rolls, 24k, and the tropical fried rice. The fresh rolls were bland, with dry chicken and shrimp in there. I received no feedback regarding the 24k. I had the tropical fried rice, which was bland. I expected more flavor from this dish, but there was not much pineapple in the dish. I paired the rice dish with pork, which was extremely dry. I found the dish to be rather forgettable, and could only eat half of it.  One very odd item of note at this establishment was what was playing on the televisions. On the TV above the bar the movie Finding Dory was playing. On another wall was a series of videos from YouTube that were supposed to, I guess, highlight videos from Thailand. If you are familiar with YouTube you know that once a video ends a suggested video starts playing afterwards based on the previous video. When we where there the videos that were playing were showing \"working girls\" (prostitutes) on the bangkok 112 channel. For about 30 minutes straight there were these videos playing before it stopped playing. I would suggest that this establishment be more vigilant in what is playing on these monitors.  I do not recommend this restaurant, and I will not go back to this restaurant.",

I read reviews and since I was ordering takeout, the drive through window for pick up got me to choose here.  Everything was excellent. The soup,  pad Thai, pork sticks, GF items, the chicken tender... And nothing was very spicy despite how it sounded on the menu. Some who wanted more spice added it. It worked out perfectly. Will def eat here again.  While sitting at the drive through, couldn't help but notice how cute the place is, and the patio looked great.",

In reading the other reviews about slow services yes I could see it getting a little slow to get your food, but keep in mind they make everything to order.  Nothing was sitting around getting cold and old like a lot of restaurants.  My husband even commented this will be his new place to take customers for lunch.  We went for lunch and were very tempted to go back for dinner.  There is also a drive in window that you can call ahead and pick your food up.  Wish I could give more than 5 stars!",

As for the Thai food it was decent and the service is fairly casual and easy going.  I asked the person at the front for recommendations and decided to try the Yellow Curry rice bowl. The food was about what I expected and although I knew that it was going to be mild spicy it was actually more spicy than expected. The mild spicy seemed more like a borderline medium, which is probably what I preferred anyway.  I also noticed that this restaurant features a drive thru, something that most Thai restaurants do not offer. Based on this I would most likely come back here to try some of their other dishes especially as the Basil Chicken looks pretty good.",

I guess this place was featured on the food network show Diners and drive- Thrus? Or something like that I am not sure. But it's interior is way different inside its like a nice hip lounge nice lighting and view of the patio and drive thru! You can sit at a table of 4 or or 2 or even at the bar for a nice drink special. You sit yourself, when I went only one waiter at the time but I came after a lunch special rush so I didn't get any special lunch meals since I missed out! I always order pad Thai and a appetizer so I got papaya salad and the pad Thai with chicken l, didn't usually get asked how hot I wanted it but I asked for it to be Thai hot to see how authentic it really was! To my surprise papaya salad was good very sweet but a bit of spice which I like very delicious. Next was the pad Thai with chicken.. Now everything looked so delicious I love the cooks aesthetic for her plates so good to eat and look at I like that! I can definitely tell it was gonna be hot they used thai chili peppers on my dish and it was spicy every bite I did enjoy it! But let's just say Thai hot is really, really hot! Now watch out! But luckily I washed it down with my green tea which was delicious as well! Definitely love the fun anime background murals and cute deco the bar area has! Service was delightful and the chefs/cooks are awesome definitely found a new Thai space here in south Scottsdale!",

It wasn't busy on midweek day, lots of takeout orders  Pros: Food was great, beautiful presentation.   Cons: Service was terrible. They offered a high chair for our baby then did nothing. After a few minutes my wife found the high chairs in the back and brought it to our table. My wife asked for a straw, server again failed this simple task. 10 minutes later, I went up and grabbed one from the takeout counter.The server barely checked on us, there was one other couple in there, no reason they couldn't stop by to refill water.   If we do go here again it will strictly take out.",

I've been here twice and I have missed the turn the first time and almost again.   The food has been great here! Just service has been iffy for me which makes me give one less star.  I came here for dinner time the first time and I had the peanut passion with brown rice. When they asked me between the type of rice I wanted, I chose brown which they did not state it was an extra cost.  Also there was a large party there and as I was eating by myself, they only came up to me once. My water wasn't filled either.. I felt ignored and that if I were to ever go again, I would just order for pick up. But I guess the service is a hit or miss. This was a few months back.  I came here about 2 weeks ago with a friend because she's seen it and wanted to try it so we came for dinner. We got the dragon eggs which is like shumai. Tasty!  I also had the beef panang and man it was spicy for a 2 chili pepper. I can't imagine if it was a 3 chili pepper rating meal.. It was delicious though :)  The service was better and we actually got checked up on a couple of times.  Not ignored like the last time..   So overall, great food that even Guy Fieri gave them props.  Just service can be a hit or miss depending on your server I'm guessing.",

Hubby got the peanut chicken which was out of this world good. I got the Panang curry, swapping out the beef for chicken. I love hot spicy Thai food and this did not disappoint. I usually need to add a good helping of red chili pepper sauce to get the heat to my liking, this came out perfect! Love the soup that comes with the combo-very good!!  Service was perfect, food came out very quickly.   We will definitely be back, and are already making plans to visit the parent restaurant, The Wild Thaiger, in the very near future.",

The waiter was focused on bringing out checks one by one to 3 other tables. After we got the menus we waited another 15 minutes to order our food. Again, the waiter was moving around taking care of non-essential things like inefficiently cleaning a table or two with multiple trips to the kitchen to clear it off. He also would stick his fingers in the glasses to bring them to the kitchen, was seen running his fingers through his hair multiple times and then bringing food to the tables without washing his hands. We waited 50 minutes from the time we walked in until the food made it to our table. The number of tables in the restaurant and the takeout biz did not warrant this wait. When we were finished we had to ask for the check...... and wait and wait again. We had two checks for the table and he got that wrong too. The food was delicious but definitely not worth going through that experience again. Plenty of other great Thai restaurants in Phoenix.",

We ordered the Yellow Curry Rice bowl with chicken, the Kama Ramen, an boba Thai Iced tea. My dish was the ramen and I was very underwhelmed. The noodles were not traditional ramen noodles and the broth was ok ,  but improved when I added salt. If you are a Ramen fanatic, don't waste your taste buds on this. My sister had the Curry. It had really good flavor and some spice to it. There was plenty of chicken and  a nice amount of chunky veggies. Our boba teas were disappointing. They did not have the flavors we initially wanted. When they came, the bobas were not cooked enough and some were crunchy. Besides that, the flavor of the teas were good. Another bonus is that they have a drive-thru,  which is a great option if you have a baby in the car like me.   I may give this place another shot, but I'm not hurrying back anytime soon.",

    "text": "I will start by saying that tonight was my 3rd time here in the last 2 weeks. I have tried several different items and so far they have all been great! My first visit I wasn't really in the mood for curry, so I went with the Candied chicken which is lightly coated in a plum sauce that is really good. On my next visit I had the yellow curry with chicken which spicy, but not too spicy, and a creamy coconut sauce which is really tasty. However my favorite part of the curry dish was the potatoes! I also ordered the Thaiferno burger as I was curious what it was like. The burger was very juicy and had some sort of herbs and seasoning cooked into it which made it very flavorful. It was too with cheese, veggies and some sort of spicy sauce that was a little different for a burger, but still good. Tonight, on my 3rd visit, I went for the Peanut Chicken combo with vegetables and the tropical chicken fried rice. The peanut chicken was awesome and is so far my favorite dish I've tried here. The peanut sauce is really tasty with the jasmine rice and it also came with a mix of cauliflower, broccoli, potatoes carrots and more. Definitely my favorite. I had originally ordered the tropical fried rice with beef, but when I got home I noticed they made it with chicken. I wasn't upset about this as the chicken was really good and now I just have another reason to go back for the beef! I also ordered a slice of mango cheesecake that i have yet to try, but it looks amazing! The green tea is great too as it has a plum taste, I think it might be Arizona brand? Oh and if you plan to order anything more than a rice bowl or curry, call your order in if you want to use the drive through as it can get busy here!",

This place is the smaller one in Scottsdale saw it on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives thought I'd try it been there three or four times since then probably once a week everything is prepared to order Super Fresh pretty spicy it's not the easiest place to find you can drive by it but if you're on Tomas Road it's right past Scottsdale Road but you got to look for it it's worth stopping at if you like Thai food you'll love this place",

We chose the restaurant because it had great reviews and also a drive thru pick up window. We called in our order at 7:35pm and were told our order would be ready in 30 minutes. We arrived at the restaurant about 15 minutes later and were prepared to wait the extra 15 minutes remaining for our order. The drive thru has a buzzer and after ringing the waitress came to the window and told us it was almost ready. After 20 minutes passed she came to the window to ask if we needed plastic dinnerware and we declined. Another 10 minutes passed and we buzzed again to check on the ETA, and once again told it was almost ready. Shortly after our last inquiry a man came to the window and rudely informed us that the waitress had checked on us 3 times and food would arrive soon. All total we sat at the window for over 1 hour before receiving our takeout. Their were only 2-3 tables occupied in the restaurant so the delay wasn't because they were busy. The food we received was mediocre at best, the vegetarian curry consisted of mushy vegetables. and the portions were minuscule. I usually take home bigger leftover portions from Thai restaurants when I dine in. The overall experience was very disappointing and I definitely do not recommend this restaurant.",

It took a very long time for someone to take my order at the drive thru and an oddly long time to get my food. Another time when I walked in for take out, it seemed like a bunch of the staff's friends were just hanging out and it made ordering a little awkward bc they weren't paying attention to the customers. And they got my order wrong that time. I ordered mochi, but they gave me a slushi thing. I wasn't that angry though, because it turned out to be delicious. So go for awesome, inexpensive, easy food, but don't expect the same level of amazingness from the service. Just be patient and all will be well.",

The coconut soup didn't taste too bad overall, however, it was over sweetened. It tasted like sweet coconut milk mixed with other staff.The temple of fire is way too spicy ( I love spicy food and I'm from Szechuan), but I couldn't handle the fried rice here. It gave me stomachache. The Kimow was average, a lot of noodles but minimum meat. The Thai tea was so sweet, I felt I was drinking syrups. The restaurant only has small round tables for two, Not convenient for group of three or more. It would be great if they allowed their customers to select spicy level (mild, median, hot, Thai hot etc.), otherwise it's too risky to order spicy dishes. I would get to go dishes from here, the actually dine/in portion is smaller other Thai restaurants' dishes anyway.",

    "text": "We live down the street, and finally came to give it a try. We tried the chicken pad thai and veggie spring rolls. The veggie spring rolls were great, crispy and tasted super fresh. The pad thai was good. Average, but not the best I've ever had. There's a lot of filler items on the plate in the form of cabbage, I'd have preferred more noodles. We will probably come back out of convenience to our home, but not out of craving.   I wouldn't recommend coming here for a quick dinner. Service was very slow. Everyone was very friendly and nice, but the pace of the meal was suuuuuper slow. We were sitting almost 25 min before anyone took our order. And then almost 10-15 minutes after we had finished our meal. For dinner for two, it took about an hour and 40 min.",

They do a lot of to go orders but the service in house is very welcoming.   Food is on point with flavors, portions, prices and quality. I had the satay tasting and it is a very good 2 person share app option. I had the beef skewer specia and I must say it is very well executed. All the food was done perfectly with moist and tender cuts. Close to closing might get busy even during the week, so come early.  For sure I will be returning not only for the great food but also for the welcoming sensation.",

Highly recommend checking this place out if you've never been. Thank you Little Thaiger!",

I joined my dear friend Kelsey W. for dinner and there were already a few groups dining in, 30 min after they opened. We got waters and figured out our orders pretty quickly, since we were hungry. I got their pad sie ew with tofu and papaya salad, and my friend got pad thai with chicken, no spice. I realized later I wasn't asked my spice level so I asked the hostess if I could get it hot, and she said they could add Thai chilies onto my dish. Perfect.  The salad was all right, I had a tasty version in another state and it didn't meet my expectations. My noodle dish was great; the chilies really helped by adding the right amount of heat. I love how many veggies this dish has, otherwise I'm a fan of pad thai.   We ordered mango sticky rice for dessert and it was such a nice way to end our meal; it was light, refreshing, and not too sweet.  I'd definitely come back here and try some other menu items. There's even a small patio out front for when the weather is warm.",

I was craving Tom Ka Gai yesterday and after reading reviews on the soup (everyone said how great it is), I decided to Door Dash the soup along with the dragon eggs. I'm a huge fan of this soup because it is SO flavorful, but man I was so disappointed when I finally got the order.  The soup literally tasted like someone poured multiple cups of water into it - there was no flavor whatsoever, like I'm talking ZERO. I'm convinced this was a complete fluke because there's no way people actually review how great it is if it were to taste so watered down. Hopefully someone just forgot to add some necessary ingredients, so if and when I decide to give it another shot, I'll be praying for better flavors.  So that was a bummer, but the dragon eggs were the complete opposite - they were SO YUMMY. I got half steamed and half fried which I think it the way to go every time. Both are equally as delicious. DO IT!  Anyways, I'm sure I'll give it another shot in the future, but please just don't forget to add all the amazing flavors in my soup!",

    "text": "I really wanted to like Suh Noi like many other reviewers here, but it was not good.   The ambiance is strange for a Thai restaurant. They have lights that remind me of a club (think: lots of different colors) and random music mixed with club music. We entered through the back door and the bartender/waitress asked if we were ordering to go or dining in, and when we said we were dining in, she instructed us to sit wherever we wanted. Every table was open except one... maybe that should have been a sign.   The only thing saving this place from a one star review is the crispy vegetarian egg rolls. Those were pretty good, but then again, I've had better.  I came here with my friend and we ordered the crispy egg rolls, 24K curry, and pad see ew.  The egg rolls were fine, they came with a sweet and spicy sauce and cilantro, and I added extra sambal (hot sauce).   The pad see ew was kind of sad and flavorless, and the broccoli had a funky flavor. I doused it in sambal to make it edible.   The 24K curry is what really got me. I'm sad to say that the flavor reminded me of the smell of cat pee. I tried to find a more eloquent way to say that... but it is what it is.   My friend thought the food tasted like it came out of a pouch, and that the sauce was gritty/powdery.   We didn't complain to the server because my friend didn't want to, but I'm being honest on Yelp. I did not enjoy the food, didn't take leftovers with me (a first), and won't be back. I wish we had gone elsewhere.",

Since we moved to Scottsdale, we continue to go to this sister restaurant, Suh Noi.  The catfish pricking is so delicious. The fish is lightly batter and fried to perfection. The curry-ish sauce with crunchy green bean and perfectly cooked eggplant is complementing the lightly fried fish. I cannot stop eating and finish the whole big plate (including the rice).   The veggie curry is also good but a bit sweet. I just added a splash of nam pla (fish sauce) and then it is just perfect. The noodle dish, pad see-aw, is also good. I ordered hot so I got some chili flake on top (love it!).",

Our top three fav's are of course the Pad Thai tofu, the Pad See Yew, and the Catfish Praking. All dishes are different flavors but full of texture. The Catfish Praking has become my latest favorite. A generous fried catfish filet with a scoop of rice. The side sauce is something that should go on every meal you ever eat. It packs a little heat but the flavor profile is just ridiculous. And the catfish is so tender and flaky.  The pad thai is always a winner, with fresh bean sprouts to add that crunch, and the sauce is winner. So many places add a ketchupy type sauce and it's awful.  Stick with a great thai like Suh Noi and you'll think you're in Phuket for as long as the meal lasts!",

On a side note, we had no idea this was a Triple-D restaurant which was a fun bonus. The inside is pretty small, but we had no problem getting a table. On yet another random side note, loved the Pokemon art work across the bar. Totally dig this place. Want to come back and try the Tom Ka Gai too.",

I order the beef and broccoli (Thai hot) whenever I come here, and everything is perfection. They don't skimp of the beef, and there are plenty of vegetables, including broccoli, carrots, onions, and bell peppers. The broth, if you call it that, is extremely flavorful, and the portions are wonderful. (I eat a lot, so I usually order an extra side of rice, and I'm absolutely stuffed at the end of my meal.)  My meal usually runs me about $21-22 after a modest tip, so it's definitely a fair deal for a chance to eat the best food Phoenix has to offer.  On a side note, Chef Ola also does a lot of community outreach, so how can you NOT support a business like this?",

We had a gift certificate so we thought to try it and I'm glad we did. We ordered at the cashier and the girl there was very helpful in deciding what we wanted. We got the Pad thai, Beef Panang, and the Prig King. They were all really tasty! The only thing about it was that the portion is pretty small. I mean we each got a plate and had to go across the street to Taco Bell to order a couple Tacos each. When we told the girl bringing us our food (which came out pretty fast) that the portion is on the small side she said that the portions will be getting bigger the following day. We couldn't believe it! We missed it by a day. But overall, the food was great and the cashier was helpful so I will be back.",

Really, so small that I kept looking in the bag to see where the rest of it was.  The entree prices are typical to slightly-high for similar quality Thai food ($12.90 with tax for my order).  I always split an entree of Thai food with my daughter, and we are good to go.  I have done this at over 5 different Thai restaurants in the valley, and portion sizes are never an issue.  I am not talking about a total of five meals; I'm talking about dozens of visits to each of our top 5 favorite Thai restaurants.  It felt light when I picked up the to-go bag, but when I saw the portion size when I got home, it became evident why it seemed as if the bag was filled with lightly packed feathers.  I didn't even try to share this; I gave the whole meal to my daughter, and I made a deli sandwich with some turkey from my last trip to Costco.  I did taste it though, and man it was good.  My daughter loved it too.  If I win the lottery and prices and value don't much matter anymore, I'll be back.  Until that day, I'll stick with my regular Thai food favorites where I don't have to break the bank to get a meal.",

I also ordered the Dragon Eggs, crispy. This puts a spin on the normal crab/fish cakes most Thai restaurants offer. Just read the ingredients and you can get a pretty good idea.

We started with corn fritters - whole kernels of corn blended in a sweet/spicy light batter - and fresh roles with shrimp and chicken. Both were delicious, the corn fritters well worth driving across town for! We then had the Phuket Sea food Fantasea and the Mi Dang. The seafood was delicious and fresh and served over rice noodles with vegetables. The red beef, vegetables and noodles in the Mi Dang were fantastic and both sweet and spicy.

    "text": "My Thai wife and I just finished dinner and am writing to say this place is a gem.  My wife started with the Papaya Salad and I had Larb Gai, which is surprisingly not on the menu but pretty much a Thai staple.  It was great they made this dish for me with no problem.  We each added sticky rice.  Both dishes were excellent.  For our main course my wife ordered Holy Chicken Basil but substituted pork and I had the Peanut Chicken.  We each added brown rice.  Again, neither dish disappointed.  I think we over-ordered because the potions were significant, thus we had take-home.  No complaints there.  We only drank water so the total meal was $44.00, which for as much food as we ordered was an exceptional value.  As noted by other reviewers the restaurant is immaculate.  The two young ladies named Gabby and Esperanza were constantly cleaning when not taking care of their food serving responsibilities.  I mean they really cleaned.  Not the cursory swipe of a nasty wet rag over a portion of a table.  I wish all restaurants were half this clean!  The cooks (Pa and Mawn) are the sweetest ladies and not surprisingly took time to talk to my wife and I to make sure we were pleased with our meal.  If you have a desire for Thai food and are in the Scottsdale area I strongly urge you give this place a try as you will not be disappointed.  It is after all aroi mak mak.  As a side note to another reviewer (Bryan K., Alexandria, VA), I realize we all have a right to our opinions (there's an old saying about such) but this struck me as write-anything-that's-on-your-mind(!) lacking much thought.  I can't image what would have given you the impression it was a sushi establishment.  Were you thrown by the name \"Suh Noi\" and didn't finish reading after the \"su\"?  Here's a clue.  If you ever walk into a sushi restaurant and there is no sushi bar, well, it's not a sushi restaurant.  \"Big tasting.\"  \"We got steamed.\"  Who writes like that?  We're all dumber for having had to endure your review.  Be more responsible and literate when writing your reviews.",

The Thom Kha soup was barely spicy enough though it was creamy and I liked the vegetables in it but the soup I am accustomed to usually allows the mushrooms to absorb the flavors, and that was not apparent with my order.  The noodles in the accompanying meal were OK but again not spicy enough despite requesting so, the chicken was tough and tasteless.  The meal looked appetizing enough but was a sad disappointment when it came to taste.   Not likely to return",

So about a month ago, the parent restaurant, Thaiger, on Central Ave. was featured on Guy's Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. You'll figure that out about as fast as I did because of all the signed posters and TVs showing the episode throughout the restaurant.   TIP: they don't have a drive-thru but they do offer pick up at their converted drive-thru window.  Disclaimer: I know there are a lot of Thai food snobs out there and I'll be straight forward and tell you I'm not one of them. I just like food that tastes good regardless if it's \"authentic\".  That being said, the food did taste good and I'll be back. I asked the girls at the register what we their most popular dish and ended up with the two menu items featured on Guy's show, dragon eggs and mu yang.   The green papaya salad was good with the right amount of heat. I had half the dragon eggs steamed and the other half fried. Both were good and in the future I'll get all steamed -- personal preference. The chicken skewers were tender and the sticky rice was also tasty and lived up to its name.   I'm looking forward to trying more items. Another TIP: I grabbed the menu pamphlet and will to carry out from the window.",

The rice bowls are decently good, and the thai-styled burger was actually fairly delicious; however their thai tea was disappointing. The boba also tasted weird and mushy, not how other boba normally tastes.

    "text": "Went there on a Friday at 11am for Lunch. Party of 3, all ordered Chicken Pad Thai. It took about 40 minutes to receive our food. They might have been short on cooks or something but regardless, the wait was pretty long despite we were the only other customers along.  When the food came, the presentation was decent. Lots of curly string carrots, bean sprouts and shredded cabbage. Mixed it all together and went to town. Taste was decent 8/10.   The environment is nice and modern. There are some interesting desserts and they serve alcohol which most other Thai places typically do not.",

    "text": "Currently sitting here now. While the food has been delightful so far, the service has been severely lacking. We started our evening by walking in to the restaurant and up to the counter, where the server had her back to the door and us for several minutes. My friend and I stood there talking and while I hoped that the sound of our voices would cause her to turn around and notice us, it did not actually happen until she went to move away from the counter.   The entire ordering process was painful as she kept telling us that \"she'd be right back\". Despite only having one other table at the time, this girl seemed to have a great deal of trouble multitasking.  Considering how much I enjoyed the original location in Phoenix, I'm greatly disappointed with my experience tonight.",
