We have been working our way down the menu of delicious tacos, Tortas and other great items, and find ourselves already planning the next visit to try another amazing dish. Everything is fresh and expertly made with the care of a good family-owned restaurant. Everyone there is very nice and inviting. If you like sauces and salsas, than you can't get better than here! I have tried them all, but usually end up back at the awesome green sauce! I would recommend (and have recommended) this restaurant to anyone!",

    "text": "Okay so theres a time in a persons life where they like to have choices.. lots and lots of choices.. well living in the southwest choice is abundant, so much so that the lists can be pages long when it comes to food and drink. Its really overwhelming!  The Mr and I like to take weeknight foodie plunges. Generally on weeknights I'm slaving over a hot wok, comal or grill while the Mr 'works' late, just managing to show up just in time to eat (life seems so unfair doesn't it?)! So when he got home last night and didn't see dinner ready he knew it was plunge night.   We both knew it had to be some sort of sandwich. We've been wanting to try a new place not to far from home called Andreoli's but for some reason I thought they close early. So then I was up to bat.. torta's! Oh yeah and I saw a write up in the New Times last week for a place on 16th Street. So we piled into the Honda and headed west.  This place is only a few blocks south of the famed Bario Cafe. Inside the place has been updated with tin roof walls and a clean open appearance. Inside oddly enough was a very attractive blond woman (think Uma Thurman) cleaning off the tables. She was the nicest person I had met in some time! She walked us through the menu answering our questions and making many suggestions. We finally ordered 2 torta's and a quesadilla (a gurl has got to eat!)! She then invited us to their salsa bar.. 3 different salsas, pickled carrots/jalapeno and freshly sliced cucumbers. Oh, beware.. the salsa's are on the spicy side and may cause pooper fire syndrome!   The tray arrived with our mexiches and quesadilla.. the Mr bit into his Pastor (4.99) and his eyes widened as if to attempt to make his mouth bigger by intimidation. Large cubes of pork simmered in a spicy red sauce inside of nice thick bun that had been lightly toasted. On to my Cubana (5.90).. This bad boy is also on a toasted bun though inside.. ham, roast pork, milaneza, cheese, lettuce and mayo. Whew, it was good good good.   As we were noshing through the torta's the quesadilla caught my eye. It looked so lonely sitting there with melted cheese oozing from the edges.. so seductive, enticing.. fresh. I had to take a bite!  Yeah babe, you're so good. The Alambre (4.99) is filled with onions, cheese, beef and pork slices on a very large flour tortilla.. this alone was worth the drive! The texture of the onions and cheese against the tender meats and crispy tortilla was just delish! This paired nicely with the Horchata (1.99)..  silky smooth and not overly sweet.  I guarantee next week when the Mr gets home and the kitchen is dark and empty he will know it his turn to buy dinner!",

So, I woke up craving a good carne asada torta today, I decided to go to this place.  The service is great they're pretty friendly which is why they get one star, the other star is for their mango agua which was pretty good. As far as the torta it was not that great, but I've  had worst. To tell u the truth I'm not sure if it was the torta or the really \"depressing\" environment in the place. I was the only one in there, the place has plain decor, no music, the AC didn't seem to be working, and there was flies.  I must say it has been the most depressing meal I've had in a while.",

Coincidentally, they started getting a lot of press for being one of the best sandwich places in the Valley.  The cynic in me makes it hard not to think that they are coasting a bit on their rep with the gringo crowd.  This place isn't consistently fast or consistently good - and on multiple occasions, they've even been out of key ingredients early in the day.  Still, the tortas are good, and they aren't so much over-priced as other torta places are under-priced.  Decent value, decent quality, 3 stars.",

Still, this is the 3rd time I've come to this restaurant to find it closed.  It's like they don't want (or perhaps don't need) any business.  It's Mother's Day so I guess they are spending time with their moms.  They are probably eating at another restaurant, a restaurant with sense enough to accept a lot of business on Mother's Day.   2 stars for the unreasonable business hours which just makes me very frustrated.  I'd give it 4 stars but I just can't take the closing at 4:00 pm on Sundays and 7PM the rest of the week.",

I had the Al Pastor which was moist and properly seasoned and the horchata water wasn't overweeningly sweet like other places. Grandma cooking in the back is always a good sign of great food to come.

The interior is warm and welcoming and I love supporting a family run business, especially when three generations of the family are typically working when we visit.   I usually order 3 Pastor Tacos. The meat is always nicely caramelized and has a great flavorful marinade. It is topped with either raw or pickled onions and cilantro which adds a nice refreshing crunch. My husband usually orders the Milanesa Torta and has always been satisfied. I especially enjoy the salsa bar.  My only wish is that they would include a rice bowl or some type of salad on their menu.  The quality of the food is always excellent for the price.

To begin, you can definitely tell that this is a family owned and run business because of that the service is so good. They are all very friendly and the dining is so clean.  I got the cubano with fries. The fries are just simple fries but still good. The cubano..I was sad I was full and couldnt finish it. My only problem like most sandwiches was that my aguacate kept slipping out. (real world problems) The flavors were so good and the tortilla chips are definitely worth getting you could tell they were fresh and warm and perfectly salted.",

I find that most AZ Mexican food is pretty bland and the meats don't have much flavor, but I was so impressed with the variety offered here. We had the cochinita, al pastor, and alambre and they were all soo flavorful. Do yourself a favor and get the alambre taco/torta... it sounds different but it totally works and might be my new favorite! The restaurant itself is adorable inside, plenty of seating and room, 2 tvs on the wall, and the staff- which appeared to maybe be all family, was so nice. I'll make the 25 minute drive here any day!",

This place is another hole-in-the-wall establishment brought my way via Yelp. The torta el pastor was phonomenal! They have a huge salsa bar with this green concoxion that looks like it would be avacado something, but it's totally spicy as wasabi.  I dream of stuff this spicy: I completely drowned my torta in this.  My friend and I were the only people here minus a younger couple behind the counter, and an elderly couple who made the food.  My friend who came with and was as blown away as I was.  Such a great little establishment in close proximity to downtown; I'll be back.",

    "text": "I didn't realize that I had a set of Mexican Grandparents, until I stepped into this modest looking haven of fine Tortas.  These things are made with as much love as a mother gives to her newborn baby, and that's no understatement!  I have visited this location on three separate occasions within the past year while waiting for my tires to be serviced across the street.  Upon each visit, I was greeted with a sincere, unbiased, smile that could only come from the heart of a grandparent who was just grateful for each day of life and who got their joy from making others happy by cooking them a meal that only a grandmother is capable of concocting.  From the sweet little voice that takes your order, to the smiling grandpa in the kitchen who makes each Torta or Taco to your liking, you can't help but feel the love in this place, despite the not so attractive surrounding businesses. It really does feel like you're visiting your innocent grandparents who live in a not so hot neighborhood.  Now onto the food that can't help but soak up all of that love that surrounds it.  Today, I ordered the Torta Al Pastor. If you aren't familiar with Al Pastor style meat, which is most commonly associated with pork, you need to do a little research, because you are in for a real treat! I would consider Al Pastor style to be the Mexican version of what Rednecks call BBQ Style. This torta would be the Mexican equivalent to a pulled pork sandwich.  From the warm, lightly toasted bread that is classically used with Tortas, to the light mayo, the Avocado, shredded lettuce, thin pickled green Chile's, thin sliced tomato, marinated pork in the Al Pastor seasonings, the love is in every bite of this beauty.   I'm not big on bread, and sub sandwiches just have way too much bread that take away from the flavor of the quality parts of the sub sometimes. The Mexicans really outdid us with the Torta. When a torta is made fresh and properly by an experienced set of Mexican old timers who love to see people smile when they eat their food, it's something that will put any hot sub in town to shame!  If you aren't a fan of swine, don't be alarmed, there are many other selections, and yes the do have a Torta Carne Asada for the unadventurous Weditos.. ;)  Don't be such a Wedito and go try something different, I can assure you that regardless of the torta at this location, you will not be dissatisfied, and I promise that you will feel like you are eating at your Mexican Grandparents place...  While you are in this place, help them unlock their business on Yelp. They are like most other grandparents and technology has run right past them.  This place could use some business, and I know that others out there who are like myself, always love to know of random little places that may not look so hot from the street, but are a real treat once you break through those doors.  Can't wait to start seeing some more reviews on this place, it deserves some Yelp attention!  Cheers and Salute! ;)",

Add on exceptionally friendly service and great value (good-sized sandwich with fries for $8), and I will be back here. Often. Replacing Los Reyes as my valley torta of choice.",

    "text": "Fast, friendly, clean, affordable, delicious.  I would happily exhaust more adjectives to describe this place, but I trust I've gotten my point across.  Add this place to the slew of amazing restaurants occupying a magical culinary stretch of 16th Street in Phoenix from CenPho to Downtown.  Barrio Cafe, Middle Eastern Bakery, Mariscos Playa Hermosa, La Santisima, and now Tortas El Guero (TEG) all occupy a special place on my taste buds for turning out some amazing food.  As with all of these places, the humble exterior of TEG might not look like much, but inside there's some great stuff happening.  TEG is located about three blocks south of Thomas on the west side of 16th Street.  You could easily pass it by amongst all the other small strip centers in the area.  Parking is limited here (maybe 6 or 7 spots) so just bear that in mind.  Once inside you're greeted by a simple but clean interior with seating for probably 40-50 hungry customers.  Order at the register here and they bring the deliciousness to you.  The big board menu behind the register gives you your options in english y espanol and includes options for burritos, tacos, sides and drink options.  But the True stars here are the tortas.  Truth be told, this isn't my first go around with the iconic torta.  Not by a long shot.  I've made numerous journeys to Los Reyes de la Torta, grabbed tortas at Taqueria El Chino, and even sampled tortas from the now defunct (but soon to be resurrected) Gallo Blanco.  To this point, I really can't say I've had a bad one yet.  For TEG, the torta that they most proudly advertise as their calling card is the Cubana.  While the ingredients do read much like a traditional Cubano sandwich (including the ham and cheese), this one takes multiple steps further.  You've got your ham and cheese sure, but here they add even more pork, a breaded steak, tomato, avocado, lettuce, mayo and even some jalapenos.  Add a side of fries and you've got TEG's answer to the usual sandwich and fries.  To wash my meal down, I can't resist some great house made horchata.  Total for the food, drink and tax came to $13.  As soon as that sandwich came out a few minutes later I knew I'd hit pay dirt.  The layers upon layers of ingredients just staring at me like a rainbow.  Admittedly there weren't a lot of fries that came with this, but I was too busy getting fat and happy off this sandwich.  Each bite was heavenly.  Its hard not to make a mess when you're trying to bite off a tall sandwich like this, but trust me, its well worth the extra napkins.  I especially liked the steak and pork combo and the avocado smoothed out all the spices and acidic elements beautifully.  And TEG's horchata was blended very nicely indeed and provided the perfect cap to the meal.  I was in and out in less than 30 minutes and perfectly full.  The perfect quick stop for lunch or dinner.  So seriously folks, if you haven't explored TEG or this stretch of 16th Street, you seriously need to get down here.  I'm still just scratching the surface of 16th Street and already I'm positively dazzled by this culinary wonderland.  As for TEG specifically, fantastic sandwiches, reasonably priced, well kept restaurant and friendly staff.  Oh and for you vegetarians out there, they have options here for you too.  I may very well love tortas as much as I love tacos and burritos at this point.  I mean, tortas may not be able to bring about world peace.  But if they're as good as TEG's are, its a good place to start.",

They were out of the small buns so we shared a medium size Torta. We wanted to Milanese's  d pollo and they were out of that too.  Based on the closing hour, 6 PM, this must be a great lunch place. We settled on the pollo torta.  The food came quickly.  The Torta was very good and fell apart as we were eatng it.  Nice ripe slices of avocado and large pieces of chicken breast.  The fries were freshly made and good.  Staff are friendly and the place is clean. Lots of seating. The cost for a torta is competitive to other torta eateries.",

Ordered a mini Asada torta, they didn't have any mini bread so had to get the regular size and glad I did!  The tortas come with French fries or you can ask for tortilla chips instead.  Get the chips because they have a fresh salsa bar available.   The salsa on the far right is on point, I didn't get a chance to try the other flavors.  The asada was delicious, though I love mayo I wish they had some other kind of sauce on it that had more kick.  Generous portion of meat and avocado, lettuce mayo, grilled onions.  Really enjoyable to eat.  Hubs got the cubano which is a shredded pork, didn't get the opportunity to try it, but he enjoyed it as well.  We will definitely return, can't wait to try more menu items.",

I walked in and saw the chalkboard menu and noticed that the torta is pretty pricey (reg for $8 something). I still ordered an Alambre torta just to try it and ordered an horchata.   After sitting down and waiting for my food, the owner/cashier walked to me and said that the horchata will take 10 mins so I asked her what else she recommends. She suggested the coconut one so I trusted her and went with it.   The food and drink came and I just noticed all the avocado that they put into my torta. I was happy with it because it was a pretty good amount. The coconut agua was really good as well! I liked every single bite I took of the torta. The fries was the only thing that only tasted okay, but that was fine with me. Although the torta looks small, it was very filling.   Overall, the service was awesome and the food was delicious.",

I have been eating here for about a year or more, and over the last 2 months I have noticed a discernable difference in the taste and quality of the torta. It has managed to get smaller, and less flavorful nearly everytime I've been there recently, and whereas before I would have a craving for Tortas and would run to El Guero, now I find myself searching for other lunch time eateries.   I know the economy has been tough on all of us, and I hope that Tortas El Guero can recover. I will continue to go back here to check up on the wonderul owners and eat their food, I just hope it goes back to it's old ways sooner than later...",

Gustavo (the owner) & his lovely wife and their 2 cute kids are the beginning of this great experience.  EVERYTHING here is good and a whole lot cheaper than many bona fide Mexican places.  My favorite is the Pollo Ahogado, aka Drowned Chicken Torta.  It has avocado,just a few jalapenos (and is the only way I've ever been able to eat those), and the most amazing red sauce. I ask for the salsa INSIDE the sandwich just to be sure.  You will need 15-20 napkins and may not be able to conquer the whole thing if you're a chica like me.  By the way.....if you go in here twice, you get treated like a friend. They are awesome.  Oh!

If you are familiar with Barrio Cafe, it's right down the street.  \"Tortas,\" for you gringos (like me), is just another way of saying \"mexican sandwich.\"  TEG also provides tacos, burritos, quesadillas and the like.   I had heard a little about TEG's tortas before I visited.  My expectations were solid without being unrealistic; however, they were a little slower at 12:30 than I had anticipated.  The crowd was predominantly hispanic , both young and old.  The restaurant itself was very clean and fairly simple.  Concrete floors, tin sheets on the wall (think Chipotle's restaurants), painted walls of yellow, brown and salmon, and framed awards and write-ups on the walls.    Now that I think about it, what's with all the concrete floors nowadays?  Have you noticed that they are in almost every restaurant now?  I'm sure they are more affordable and definitely more durable.  I wonder if it's just an Arizona thing?  Hmmm, maybe I'll save that for another blog.   All in all, the restaurant was very simple but clean and orderly.  Clean and orderly, unfortunately, are two areas that are often overlooked but shouldn't be...EVER!    The staff at TEG was very polite, friendly and fast.  If you read my last post on Bertha's Cafe, I commented about the dude with no smile.  This was not the case at TEG.  I felt welcomed and comfortable.  Don't you think all restaurants should have that as a goal?  The featured sandwich for this location was the Cochinita torta.  It's a slow roasted, shredded pork served on a wonderful, light, toasted bread with fresh avocado, lettuce, tomato and pickled jalapeno.  A point worth noting for all of you avocado lovers, the avocado was perfect!  It was ripe, bright green and full of flavor.   Avocado is one of our best superfoods but is often misused.  The last thing anyone wants to see with their food is something mushy and black or green and hard.  Unfortunately, that's what we get much of the time.  I don't know where you are getting your delicious green fruit TEG but kudos for caring about quality.  The pork on the Cochinita torta was a unique combination of sweet, salty and slightly tangy.  After completing the first half of my sandwich I couldn't help but day dream about a giant Cochinita burrito.  Oh well, there's always next time.   Anyways, the sandwich was excellent!  I would happily go back again and again for this treat or one of their other items.  Now don't let me fool you into thinking the Cochinita was all I had this day.  Oh no my friends, I went after it.  I also tried their asada tacos, pollo tacos and their roasted pork quesadilla.  They were all fantastic, especially the quesadilla with it's homemade tasting tortilla.  Combine these items with a mexican bottled coca-cola and you'll be feeling mui bueno.  **********************  I give the Cochinita:   4 out of 5 \"M's\"    for a    M-m-m-m  **********************  Read more reviews at: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.SandwichOdyssey.blogspot.com&s=b75ee4de95f0707dfd53506f82a575bd07597495696c34db2edb61654628b638\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">SandwichOdyssey.blogspot...</a>",

The chicken and pork tacos tasted so good and the different salsas from the salsa bar were delicious. Place was very clean and service outstanding. I wasn't expecting this at all when I pulled up. I hope they open up another location on the east side.",

The horchata is probably the best I've ever had. Food is served pretty timely and staff is always nice.",

It's impossible to get a decent torta in Gilbert so I jumped at the chance to go when we were in Phoenix.   My husband and I picked up our orders to go and were pleased to see the same owners behind the counter. I was bummed they didn't have the mushroom or squash tortas to try since they sounded like good vegetarian options, but I was still happy with my avocado and cheese standby. My husband got the chicken milanesa, and my parents shared the beef alambre. Every last bite was inhaled, and my husband mentioned again a few weeks later how much he loved his sandwich. The tortas also came with fries which is a bunch of food for $9! TEG also has a great salsa bar with fresh, homemade salsas and condiments.",

The beans and the tortilla chips were great!! The variety of salsas was awesome!!  I had the Milanase de pollo torta! Phenomenal! It had thinly pieces of fried chicken with green chilies, avocado, tomato and mayo. The bread was so soft! But nicely crispy on the inside. The chicken was awesome! My dad had some of mine and LOVED it.  There are three sizes of sandwiches you can get. Mini, regular and large. Everything was just great here! Everyone liked their meals and I can't wait to bring other family here and try the burritos and tacos.",

They are a bit skimpy on the napkins and salsa, only giving 2 little salsa cups wen they offer like 5 diff salsas. Didn't bother to ask for more. The green one is the best.

I was driving around the area of town near Tortas el Guero, looking for Mexican food, when I caught the \"Tortas\" out of the corner of my eye. I pulled into the parking lot and decided to try it out based on the positive Yelp reviews.  Well, let's just say that those positive reviews and scores were dead on. They mainly offer tortas topped with several different varieties of meat; I opted for the pastor. Every aspect of the sandwich, including the small order of French fries that came on the side, was excellent. The meat was flavorful and tender, the bread was the perfect consistently and did not become mushy, and each half of the sandwich had a hearty slice of avocado on top. They also had a thick, creamy avocado sauce that had a surprising amount of spice to it; I opted to douse it over my sandwich to compliment the mayo and add a little extra bite. There were several other salsas and grilled onions that all looked excellent, but I didn't get a chance to try them this time (well I had the chance I just forgot to get the onions). At $7.99 for a sandwich, I didn't find it to be particularly inexpensive, but the size and quality of the food is certainly worth the asking price. The also offer a mini for $4.99 for smaller appetites and a super for $12.99, which I presume feeds two people. I should also add that the staff, who I took to be the owners, were very friendly and answered my questions with a smile. I would easily give this place a top recommendation and encourage any fan of tortas, or just delicious food in general, to try it out.",

The tacos are Mexico City style, small tortillas and carne asada, tripe, tongue, pastor, etc. So good.

We arrived shortly after 12p and the place was not empty, but far from full.  Pretty quiet actually, which I was surprised as the tortas had been very highly recommended.  The layout is nothing fancy, doesn't look like much from the outside, or the inside.  The service is very friendly and very helpful.  The guy who helped us made some great recommendations.  First off, the tortas are great.  The bread is made special for them (think it's a bolillo roll, or something like that).  But they taste fresh and go perfectly with the tortas.    We had the milanesa de res, which is basically a breaded carne - it was fantastic - the torta comes with the meat of your choice, some jalepenos, lettuce and a couple small slices of avocado.  So simple, so delicious.    We also tried the Cochinita torta, which was tasty, but not quite as over the top delicious as the other.    They have a choice of a couple sauces at a little salsa bar - the red chile sauce is mediocre, the spicy chile verde was surprisingly spicy and exceptionally tasty.  I got so excited by a sample that I piled it onto my torta and ended up sweating through the rest of it!  It is sneaky spicy!  The horchata was great, if not overly memorable.    I'll definitely be back.",

For 8 bucks I took a carry-out Alambre Torta with fries.. this thing was loaded with Asada, bacon, onions, peppers and cheese.. and obviously mounds of avocado and a perfectly sliced tomato.. I was thouroughly impressed with this place and I will definitely be a returning customer who will end up trying every one on the menu.. Bravo Zulu!!!! Do yourself a favor and get ya some!!! The people are very nice and dont forget to hit up the salsa bar as the cashier will give you cups.. very very very very clean inside.. good job guys doing a craft that not only you are good at but is a delicious alternative to all that lame ass fast food out there..",

I felt pretty \"guera\" walking into the place as all of the customers were clearly spanish-speaking only as well as most of the employees. Embracing my latina half, I ordered a carne asada torta to- go in my best spanish, which is about on par with a three year old idiot child.   Be warned, not the quickest torta you're gonna get, I waited nearly half an hour. Luckily, they have telenovas playing on the tv, which are fantastically amusing, even if you don't speak the language.   But it was well worth the wait-my torta was delish! I got it with everything, which included pico de gallo, lettuce and mayonnaise, all on grilled bolillo bread. Amazing. They have a huge selection of tortas so there is something for everyone.  mmm tortas, where have you been all my life??",

    "text": "The name says it all.  This family owned restaurant (3 to be exact) specializes in tortas but they also carry your staple Mexican fast-food affair you would find in AZ.  Everything I or anyone else has had has been solid.  Just in case you don't know what a torta is, the best way I can explain what one is that it is essentially a toasted sandwich with a fusion of Mexican and American ingredients.  When it comes to TEG's tortas, there are a few standouts.  One would be the cochinita.  Cochinita which is marinated pork is absolutely delicious by itself, but in a torta, it is absolutely scrumptious!!!  My best description of what cochinita is to think of pulled pork that is braised in a slightly sweet, salty, and spicy redish/orangeish sauce.  In addition, it has American sandwich staples such as mayo, shredded lettuce.  What makes it a \"torta\" are the slices of sweet and sour pickled jalapenos and carrots and slices of avocado (and they do not skimp).  What completes the sandwich, I mean torta, is the bread.  It's always warm and fluffy in the inside and the outside always has a nice crisp texture from the grill.   The other torta I would strongly recommend is the carne asada.  The combination of the carne asada steak with mayo, fresh pico de gallo, and lettuce along with the warm bread makes this torta an absolute winner (my mouth is actually watering just thinking about it!).  The Cubana, which has your typical ingredients that come with any spin on the classic Cuban, is also good.  If you are a big fan of Cubans, then this one may be for you. But in my humble opinion, this does not anywhere near come close to the yummy goodness of the cochinita and carne asada.  The Hawiiana (Hawaiian) is also a relative good choice.  With the combination of Ham and fresh grilled pineapple along with other condiments, it also is descent selection.  As I stated before, they do have staple Arizona style Mexican fast-food here and there are a few I would recommend.  One would be the flautas (large deep fried rolled tacos).  The pollo is the one I would suggest.  If you envision your typical fried rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, well this is not that, this is even better!  The flautas at TEG are larger with much more stuffing then your typical rolled tacos.  In addition, they make them with yummy flour tortillas, not your typical corn.  The shredded chicken is well seasoned and moist.  The tortilla is always fried perfectly, light crisp on the outside with the inside of the tortilla still soft.  The burritos here are good, actually better than average, but because the tortas here are the showcase, everything else takes a backseat.  The rice and beans are hit and miss, especially at the Chandler location.  I used to give TEG four and a half stars, but with the mistake of expanding too quickly, combined with quality and consistency falling a bit, I would have to give them three and half stars; four stars would be stretching. I'm anal so three and three quarter seems to fit.  For example, the Phoenix location, which the Son runs and where he started the chain has a few issues.  For example, the Cochinita at the Phoenix location is always drier and saltier than the other two locations.  In addition, they have certain items only at that location that the other two do not.  One would be their Sonoran style hotdogs, which are excellent and an item I would highly recommend.  When I have gone to both the Mesa and Chandler location and asked for them, and unfortunately they said they don't carry them.  I was disappointed to say the least.   Another example of inconsistency is the last time I went to the Chandler location.  I brought a couple of out of town guests, and I was a little disappointed because the bread was a little too bready (dense) and not light and fluffy as usual.  When all the ingredients are in perfect symphony, you have one amazing torta, but when one ingredient is off such as something like the bread being too dense throws off that harmonious balance of flavors and textures.  In this case, it made a difference from a four and half star sandwich to a 3 star sandwich (which is still good in my book, but not great).  The best and most consistent is their Mesa location.  I think that it is because Mom and Pops run that particular location (well they used to anyways).  Everything has always been consistently delici-oh-so-good.  Overall, would I still recommend Tortas El Guero, and do I still go?  Yes, but I wouldn't rave about the place like I once did especially with the inconsistencies I've experienced as of late.",

The cashier was friendly, the food was ready in a reasonable amount of time. I have notice an inconsistency in the amount of meat that will be inside a torta and I am not sure if that depends on who is cooking your food. The last time my torta had a minimal amount of carne asada, which really didn't taste like carne asada, more like carne guisada. I think they can do better in this department, there was too much lettuce in it and I am not a fan of what people like to call \"pico de gallo\" but to me is salsa bandera or salsa fresco in tort as, who cares, bottom line is it doesn't help.  I loved that when I asked for a combination of horchata and agua de pina, they just made it, no questions asked. That was delicious!  I think next time I will eat in, see if that makes a difference, I will also request for no salsa and maybe, if available, pay extra for more avocado.  I will also give their other choices a try, because maybe that's what I am doing wrong. So next time you want a good sandwich, give Tortas El Guero a try.",

All come stuffed with mayo, mustard, shredded lettuce, tomato, avocado, cheese, and of course jalapeno.   They also serve a burrito $5.95 with your choice of meat and as well as a Quesdillas for $6.99 or some Killer and I must say killer street tacos for $1.75 each that was the perfect 3 bites overflowing with meat chopped onions and cilantro served with some limes.   They also have 15 varieties of Tortas as well if you don't feel like creating your own. Really very clean on the inside and inviting as well.

I also eat here fairly frequently during the work week as well since in work in downtown phx. Lovely family run place, and they are always smiling and very welcoming. I would recommend taking a look at the website to get a more detailed descriptions of the food as the menu board is short and sweet for those who know their choices already.   I have never once had a less than amazing torta from this place. The Milaneza de Res is my favorite (add cheese and its even better!) followed closely by the classic Cubana. My husband isn't the biggest fan of french fries in general but he craves these fries because of how well done they are.  The small salsa bar is also killer. Be prepared to experiment and enjoy the surprises, tho the food hardly NEEDS it.  The only downside is it can be a bit pricey but it is so worth the money.",

Torta was perfect soft bread and stuffed. Street tacos my fave was pastor, all were flavorful. Chips are served warm and a good salsa bar. This place offers agua fresca, liquados and home made tortillas. I would come back to try cochinita pibil (not available that day) and something new. Very friendly service and clean eatery-",

Came in prior to 430p, and the woman manning the counter could not speak any English at all.  Good thing I still retained a little of basic Spanish to request that a few ingredients be omitted.  (Had I waited till 5p, I'd have no problem w/ the bilingual Caucasian server that arrived.)    Chose the carne asada torta, and the bread was good.  However, the filling was very sparse.  I suggest that TEG either use smaller-sized bread, or up the filling a bit!  The cost of the sandwich is definitely too high-- I wouldn't order this same sandwich for that price again (especially when I could order a huge serving that is equally as tasty, perhaps more so, at Phoenix Ranch Market-- the telera bread there is amazing!).  Indeed, I had to order two side tacos for their meat contents (pastor y carne asada) to be able to fill in the rest of the torta :(  Based on what I tried, if I were to come back, I'd order the pastor.  I don't think I'll be back, though.  (I will, however, visit the Michoacan ice cream parlor again next door!!  The coffee and mango flavors I tried were delicious!  What I wouldn't do to have some of the coffee right now...)",

When we pulled up to the place, it was really nice inside.  Very clean and spacious.  The outside and inside of the restaurant was well kept and there were some artists painting murals on the wall inside.  The lady who answered the phone was making our tortas and had everything ready within a few minutes.  We didn't want to wait until we got home, so we ate the tortas in the car.  They were delicious.  The bread was so soft and the beef was cooked perfectly.  We will definitely come back again, and hopefully next time get there before they close so we can eat in the restaurant instead of our car.",

It was great how it was! They also have a nice salsa bar. I love avocado salsa, delicious. We also ordered a melon agua. It had been ages since we had aguas.

Tortas El Guero came up and had an overall 4 star rating.  Figured I'd give it a try, been a while since I had a torta.  Drove over, ordered the Carne Asada torta, paid the $7.09 charge, waited less than five minutes and it was ready in the to go bag.  At first it appeared very small in the bag, but upon opening I discovered it was of normal torta size.    Got back to the office, drizzled the hot sauce they included in my bag on it, and inhaled the thing in about three minutes.  It was pretty good.  Not the best though.  The best torta I've had would have to be from Los Reyes De La Torta.  I don't know what that means in English, but that place sure is the king of the torta!",
