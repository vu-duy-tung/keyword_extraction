    "text": "Ok, this is not an ordinary airport restaurant. It's not the fastest service, but it is one of THE BEST fish tacos and the MOST INCREDIBLE green chili and cheese tamales I've ever had. And I've tried both at many, many restaurants. After spending 25 years living in Houston and traveling throughout the U.S. But since this restaurant is located in an airport most people enter with a bad attitude to begin with. The hassle of traveling, long lines, rude people...but people right next door to each other are two little gems in the Phoenix Sky Harbor Headache....Cartel Coffee and Sir Veza's Taco Garage.  Great sides also...guacamole, black beans and Spanish rice. Fish tacos available at breakfast too...big plus.",

    "text": "Customer service manager is extremely rude! After ordering a burrito and a fountain soda I had taken just a couple of sips and got a horrible taste from the unfiltered water that was used for their sodas. It was overwhelmingly bad and frankly undrinkable. I politely went up to ask if the cost of the bottled sodas were the same price because I didn't care for the fountain sodas. I was immediately asked what was wrong and explained that I could tell the water for the fountain was simply tap water and not filtered. If it was going to be an issue I was willing to pay the difference however before I could explain this to the manager, he grabbed the drink from me and threw it in the garbage and said \"Just grab whatever from the cooler I don't care\".  F&B management is something I do and THIS is definitely not a job for this guy. Bare in mind, my flight was delayed 3 hours and if I can keep my composure, I'm sure after a hard day, this bearded manager can find a way to exercise his patience and utilize his manager and customer service skills. He is setting a horrible example for the younger employees on how to treat customers. Let this behavior slide and your business will have bigger problems on their hands.",

As far as the food, its your typical taco shop in arizona, nothing amazing, but good (been to other locations). The thing that drops my review down is the unprofessionalism of the manager. I don't car what is happening you dont discipline your employees in front of customers. Yelling load enough for the whole place to hear for them to \"find something to do\", and saying \"he knows he is mean so sorry\". Dude you need to take a leadership or managment course. Other than that its a decent place to go.",

Don't they know they have us where they want us and are supposed to rip us off with high prices for marginal food? I guess these guys didn't get the memo and I'm glad. I always get the chicken bowl, but many things look really good. A big selection of craft beers on tap and flat screens seal the deal. Now I look forward to landing in Phoenix and long layovers don't even scare me anymore. Like most places in any airport the elbow room is a little close and cozy, but that just goes with the territory. Fly in when you get a chance!",

It was so disgusting. water on the  bottom, couldn't tell if the meat was chicken or beef. Gross!. I returned it with little push back. Got a fish taco instead. Again... gross! nothing authentic or good about this restaurant.  My advice... avoid it at all costs, the Zinc Brasserias customer service and food was much better.",

The Phoenix airport (or the alcohol authorities) need to move into the 21st century and provide an area in the terminal for drinking, like Denver. Or just open up the whole terminal to drinking like Vegas. Anyone stuck in Phoenix needs a drink.   The queso was pretty awful. Don't get it. The taco salad was pretty good, though. But the fact that I had to eat it standing up while crammed onto a little corner of a table was kind of ridiculous.

Pricing here was good too, so maybe using these containers is an excuse to keep the prices low, who knows.  Ultimately, I dug this place, it's just too bad they can't take it easy on those Arizona landfills.

To Cruella, or whatever your name was, it's not my fault the girl that took my order told me I could get the sliders wrapped in lettuce (instead of a bun). I even got charged for extra lettuce. I waited patiently for my food, got called up, and was given a burrito.   When I explained what I ordered, this extremely rude Phoenician said, in a snotty tone, \"We don't make that.\" Uh, well perhaps you should tell the girl that took my order at YOUR \"restaurant.\" She talked to me like it was my fault I dared order that. She then tersely says, \"Do you want to order something else or do you want a refund?\" I was like, \"Hey, stop flirting, you're making me blush!\" No, not really.  So I said to just do the sliders with the buns. She was multitasking spreading her sunshine to others, so I'm not sure if she heard me. She then walks away for 5-10 seconds, just leaving me at the counter alone. She finally comes back and says, \"What do you want to do?\" I'm thinking, \"I'd like to recommend a career change, for one. It's not my fault you probably go to Arizona State and work at the airport in food service. How about something where you can scare children or don't have to deal with customers, like bomb diffuser. I think some Phoenix passengers would appreciate that.\" But I digress.  She was really rude. I went to McDonald's and got a lettuce wrapped QPC and it was delicious for half the price.",

    "text": "Airport Food - Always a challenge, and the Phoenix Airport Terminal 4 has so many choices. I usually have an hour layover between flights at this American Hub. It is good for me as I can get in a couple of miles walk and if timing is right, even a lunch. I had a couple of chicken tacos.  Simple enough. Very nice. They grilled the onions, peppers and chicken, ha a small cup of black beans and rice, and a spicy salsa. The tacos each had two tortillas, so I halved things and ended up with four tacos and they were all wonderful. This is my new go to place in the Phoenix Sky Harbor in Terminal 4 . Thank you Sir Veza",

I read the reviews before ordering, but took a chance anyway. I am so glad I did. Their chicken bowl is so much tastier than the big name National chain brand! Mine was minus the guacamole (on purpose) so I can't speak to that, but everything else was delish. The chips weren't really seasoned, but they were toasty warm and generous in proportion. So was the bowl. I couldn't eat it all and was super sad it wouldn't be next-day-leftovers. Not sure why this place is receiving less than 4 stars. I had quick service and tasty food. This is fast-food Tex-Mex kind of stuff folks. Don't expect gourmet at an airport! The biggest downside, and the reason this fast-food stop didn't get top honors, was the terrible lack of seating. I stood to eat. They have a seated bar and a couple of tables and it is packed! No real place nearby to have a table meal either. Keep that in mind if you order a bunch of sides!",

I was tempted to offer a switch yet that would be an odd offering by a stranger.  The chips itself were fine. More on the thin, crisp side than the thicker crunch type of chip. I got 1 tablespoon of guac which was saddening. I got more sour cream than that. I'm not sure if they know what pico de gallo is because I had just diced tomatoes...no onion or cilantro which is another disappointment! ( i looked at old pics and it looked like they used to make pico de gallo w onion and cilantro...they may have forgot today) They also use cheese sauce. I don't mind it at baseball games but I love real melted cheese like they use on quesadillas. I opted for refried beans which were dry and likely canned..assuming by taste. The chicken did not taste seasoned and was fairly bland. Overall I wouldn't order again.   Next time I'm in the airport, I may try the brasserie..even though that's a few dollars more.",

    "text": "I have been a longtime patron of Sir Veza's Taco Garage; it is the only part of traveling that I enjoy. I looked forward to getting a breakfast burrito from Sir Veza's before jumping on a long flight across the country. Everything was great! Until I talked them up to my family and insisted we go get a breakfast burrito before a family vacation to Minnesota. I was so excited for them to try it. Well, my wife wasn't hungry, so she didn't order, just my brother and I ordered. The burritos came out astonishingly fast, as they usually do. My brother and I began devouring our burritos until after the second bite we looked at the now chewed off ends of the burrito. To our horror, we saw green eggs. Before you ask dear Yelpers, it was not St. Patrick's Day, and there was not a special Dr. Seuss promotion going on.   My brother was worried he would now get sick on our flight, and so was I. We googled what it meant to get green scrambled eggs and found a few answers. It was likely cooked at too high a temperature on an iron based cook top or pan. The combination of the two causes the yolks to oxidize and creates sulfur dioxide or iron oxide or something like that (go ask Bill Nye). It is perfectly safe to eat, though the sulfur laden fart smell is hard to choke down. We did not end up getting sick.   What has made me sick is the arduous process my wife has had to go through to get our refund processed. We were told by a \"manager\" that the refunds would go through in a couple days. We went on vacation for eight days and didn't think much about it. When we got back to Phoenix (late at night, after Sir Veza's was closed), the refund still hadn't processed. Now, we are talking ten or eleven dollars here. Not exactly breaking anyone's bank, but my wife and I try and live by some simple principles, and one is never to pay for something you didn't receive.  I called the store on July 13th, 2015 to ask about the refund. The manager I spoke with said she would look into the issue and call me back. No call on Tuesday. No call on Wednesday. So my wife called. She spoke to a woman named Maria who told her employee to say she wasn't there and to take a message (yes Maria, my wife could hear everything you were saying). Maria identified herself as the assistant manager.  Maria claimed that she called me and left a message, she did not. My wife asked to verify the phone number Maria had called (my wife is an indefatigable defender of truth and honesty) and the question was brushed aside almost expertly by the \"assistant\" manager. Maria tried hard to get out of having to do anything at all but agreed to call the district office. She would then call me the following day when the transaction was complete (I still have not received a phone call). Satisfied that we would finally get some justice (because we really could care less about $10/$11), My wife agreed to let bygones be bygones; but not before she asked if Maria had found that phone number she allegedly called and left a message for me. Remember my wife's tenacity? Maria blurted out a number that wasn't even close and kind of trailed off at the end. Do phone numbers now only have six digits?  There has been NO resolution. My wife called again today and found out from an ill-informed employee that Maria is, in fact, the GM of the area. We have been told that everything should be resolved today and that I will get a phone call when it has been submitted. I am not holding my breath. What's that saying? If a dog bites you once? Well... Hopefully, the same principle doesn't apply to green eggs or general managers named Maria...  I have nothing against Sir Veza's food despite my experience. I understand that mistakes happen and that being unreasonable about situations never helps get the results you want. My wife also understands this. In fact, she would tell you, despite all the pains, that Sir Veza's at Sky Harbor Airport makes the best Bloody Marry in Phoenix. We are simply upset that we have been brushed aside by this company's employees and management over a measly amount of money.  There was only one apology in this whole debacle that I am aware of. When the manager (it may have been Maria for all I know) originally tried to process the refund. She said, \"Sorry... we just got new eggs\". To which I thought, \"Did we get the old ones then\"?  So I, along with four of my colleagues and my brother, are swearing you off. It breaks my heart. Though, companies with terrible customer appreciation/service don't deserve our business. A little gratitude and sympathy could have gone a long way. A simple, \"I'm sorry this has been such a difficult process\" would have spoken volumes to their dedication to retaining a loyal customer base. Instead, we are all done with you. Well... except my wife, she is steadfast in her determination to get a refund. Also, she will be back for a Bloody Marry next time she travels. Seriously. They are that good.",

The bread buns were nice a light/fluffy - perhaps like brioche - the turkey sausage was kind of flavourless, the egg \"pancake\" was terrible, like microwaved frozen eggs terrible I honestly thought it was a pancake at first until I looked at the menu again.  There was some cheese present, but it had no taste.  I added both the salsa they give you and some sriracha I asked for, but nothing could save the sliders.  There was a side of fried potatoes/papas but they were very small pieces and had been overcooked.  Based on this meal I would not eat here again.",

Chips were soft and moist, and the queso was some crap out of a jar that was just lightly melted over a few chips. Also ordered some drinks from the bar.  Margarita came without salt asked of i could get salt and the bartender responds with, did you ask for salt? Omg, really are you serious? The answer is yes, but even if i didn't why would you even ask me that? Then my beer had 2 inches of foam in leaving my 16 oz beer with about 11oz drinkable.  I don't normally rant on yelp, but I truly don't want anyone else to make the same mistake that we did this evening.  Make the walk to gate A11 and eat at taco Blanco's 4 stars Mexican at terminal 4.",

I ordered one chicken taco and one carnitas taco both in flour.  Chicken was tasty, good flavors, not dry.  The carnitas taco was greasy and not as flavorful - would not recommend.  They charged me an extra 50 cents for the combo.  Guacamole is an extra 75 cents.  Salsa verde comes with your order, but it's pre packaged and not fresh.

I'm used to wilting lettuce on sandwiches, salads, and plates, and that's just disgusting but sadly expected in airport restaurants under $20/meal. Sir Veza's delivered.

I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan of Sir Veza's but I've been reasonably happy with what I've eaten at the restaurant in Chandler and the one in Tucson. But of course, just like other places that have gone into PHX lately, the airport incarnation fell short of the original. My husband got a burrito and customized it to be low carb (relatively speaking). They were willing to substitute the onions and peppers that come on the tacos in place of the rice and beans in the burrito, which was nice. However, they definitely did not add any extra meat and so the burrito was still pretty small and mostly tortilla. I also attempted to be healthy and ordered a taco salad which was anything but. Apparently they make it with a friend greasy flour tortilla smeared with refried beans at the bottom. Which wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't for the fact that there was a woefully small amount of lettuce. And it was of the wilted iceberg variety. However, to their credit they did remember to leave off the sour cream so that was much appreciated.   The main reason they earned three stars was the staff. The woman who took our order was friendly, efficient, and helpful. Another girl was working hard to keep the place clean in spite of the crowds and even got me an ice tea refill. That was good since our flight departure ended up being delayed so I had plenty of time to drink it.",

I ordered a vegetarian bowl which was basically just beans rice, guacamole, sour cream and salsa. Came out to about $8.50. It was easy to place my order but I had to wait 13 minutes to receive it. The space is very small and crowded and there isn't really any place to stand and wait for your to go order. Talking to another customer, she seemed very frustrated at the wait time as well. I didn't notice until I got onto the plane that my rice was over cooked and hard which was disappointing but I was starving.  I was not a fan of my experience and the food was mediocre but it was convenient.   They do have a bar with tv's which a lot of people seemed to be utilizing because the football game was on. The staff was also friendly.",

I asked for no carbs and no sour cream.  I was this expecting eggs, turkey sausage, cheese, black beans, jalapenos.  After waiting about 10 minutes I was given a large container with the above and 90% tortilla chips!  WTF and what a rip off since most of the container was the chips.  I picked out what I could.

So I looked at him and said what makes you think that's not what we were going to do? He said \"I don't know what your plan is, I just have to tell you that.\"  My husband looks at him and says \"I have never been greeted like that walking into a restaurant or up to a bar before.\"  He looked right at us and said \"I'm sure the full service bar down the way would love to serve you guys\".  I was completely dumbfounded as to what had just occurred. We had actually been to this same restaurant two nights ago while flying through and had great service and good food from a female bartender.  I said \"we were just here two nights ago and had much better service.\" .  He said \" well I wasn't here\".  My husband looked right at him and said \"no, no you weren't and we will be taking our business to that full service bar down the way just like you recommended, have a good night\".

Also make sure you are very specific on your beer order otherwise you will get the wrong one (as I did).  We try a few appetizers, mistake the first was covered in cheese whiz with a dollop of sour cream, I thing there were French fry bit swimming in there but wasn't sure.  The Jalapeno chicken sliders weren't too bad, but the onion straws with them were under cooked (no crunch at all).  And because of our massive food order it took a while for the food to arrive at our table.  And even though this place had a whack of staff obtaining a refill of salsa or chips was not an easy task.

Since they soaked all of the chips in this enchilada sauce, the whole thin tasted horrible. The bacon was in whole slices rather than broken up - doesn't make sense for eating a bowl. They used green olives which I've NEVER had on Mexican food. I hate green olives and would have asked which kind they were had I thought they might something other than the traditional black olives.

They have breakfast burritos, meaty burritos and a vegetarian veggie burrito that can be made vegan if you ask them to leave the cheese off. You can also have rice bowls, chips, guac, queso, etc.   I have had the vegan veggie burrito twice now and it was consistently delicious. It has a lot of black beans so if you are sensitive to the effects of beans, just ask them to leave it off. Also in that burrito is rice, peppers, onions, corn and guac. Their salsas are prepackaged and both red and green are so delicious. They are considerably quick for food made to order so you can grab food in between flights.  The guacamole was delicious but I was not impressed with the chips. They did not have any seasoning or salt on them so they lacked flavor. I would definitely order the burrito again or a burrito bowl.",

For so many people on that busy day and in such a tiny airport, every food place seemed packed, including this one... but I followed my instincts and stood in line with my colleague.  Ordering took awhile, but everyone who works here is super friendly. I ended up getting the carnitas bowl. I took my box and found some seats at an adjacent gate since ours was too claustrophobic. With low expectations for airport food, I opened my box and my eyes widened. The juicy carnitas looked so delicious, smothered with vegetables and tons of sour cream, which is my Mexican food weakness. I inhaled the whole thing in less time than it took me to stand in line and get it.   Though I wouldn't pick this Mexican spot over ones in San Francisco or San Diego, it definitely exceeded my expectations for airport food. Sir Veza's also has a bar area, though it was too crowded to sit there. If I had more time, and if it wasn't first thing in the morning, I would have loved to enjoy a margarita during that layover.",

The message to me was \"here's your *%*blanking*&%  food now get out.\" My \"chicken bowl\" consisted of Uncle Ben's rice - undercooked - with dry, pre-cooked, bland unseasoned chicken, brown guacamole and so much sour cream it was swimming. The \"hot\" salsa was tasteless and never mind trying any other salsa, they charge extra for that. I despise restaurants that charge extra for essentials like sauces. I ate 3 bites b/c I was absolutely starving then threw it away, wrote this review, and then went next door to Panera, like I should have in the first place, for something edible. There are a few good things about Sir Veza's: a bar (which may be how you're able too eat the food) and free refills on fountain drinks.  Poor quality food served by people who really don't want to be there = my experience. What a waste of $15.96",

    "text": "We went here for convenience. Good for airport food. Tacos, burritos or bowls. Comes with a variety of ingredients and choice of protein. You pay up front at the register, then they prepare your food in a to-go box to eat in their small restaurant seating area or take with you to your gate.   We got the beef bowl. Came with a good amount of rice, beans, meat, cheese, sour cream, salsa and even guacamole without extra charge. The portion size was good compared to the price of other restaurants at the airport.   For what it was, airport food, it was decently priced, fast and tasted pretty good. Nothing to rant and rave about, but we were satisfied.",

Their menu is simple, I ordered a burrito with grilled chicken and a \"sky harborita\". Their layout is kind of weird because anywhere you stand to wait for your food and drink will be blocking either people getting drinks at the bar or people behind you waiting to order.   Anywho, I got my burrito and drink and after a few minutes snagged a seat at a table. The harborita did it's job for $5 and the burrito was actually pretty good. Black beans, cheese, rice, meat, and a side of chile verde which was flavorful and I'm glad I dipped my burrito in it. If the burrito ($7.95) were a dollar cheaper or a little bigger, I probably would have no complaints. This is a pretty good joint and would eat here again",

I was a little hesitant as some Yelpers reviews were mixed and I was on a time crunch. I ordered a chicken quesadilla since I'm on a long flight and don't want to take any risks.   My ordered seemed to be out pretty quickly given the line and how busy it was. It seems as all of their meals are brought out in to go containers/packaging and I appreciate that as I finished eating my food on the go.   I was pleasantly surprised as some said the food was bland. My quesadilla was freshly made and the chicken was so yummy! I was expecting gross/dry chicken but instead got fresh savory chicken which made it that much better. The quesadilla was served with fresh guacamole and cheese. I don't know if that is included or if I was charged extra but if I was, I'm totally ok with it because I love guacamole and I was in a hurry.   Overall, I would recommend this place for a quick bite. Yes it's airport grade pricing but overall I've had worse. I can't speak for the other menu items but I'd definitely come back as I know what to expect!",

She is 7 and the burrito was smaller than her hand. I've never seen anything so small. Ridiculous.   The carnitas burrito that I bought was largely flavorless, with one of the dominant flavors being instant rice (like uncle Ben's you might have had at a school cafeteria in 1985). The beans were undercooked. When you are so close to Mexico and you can't make a passable burrito, you are doing it on purpose. This establishment has decided to make gross Mexican food. Sacrilege!  They also ran out of chips. How does an establishment let themselves run out of a largely imperishable staple food that everyone wants is a sign that it's poorly managed. Please don't eat at this place unless you really enjoy the flavor Uncle Ben's style rice at the forefront of your eating experience. Epic disappointment:-(",

I've killed cockroaches in there before. Ew.  This place is nasty!! Good luck!!  Oh and look at all the dust caked everywhere!! On the garage door and any prop that's in there for decoration.

That being said... in a day and age where it isn't appropriate to address someone with he or she as a pronoun because we may hurt someone's feelings, why is it ok to post vulgar stickers (with a prominent f word) proudly on display for all to see, including children.  I'm not about political correctness but why do you have to shove this in our faces.  God forbid someone might be offended by your censorship of fowl language.  Is this the image you want to put forward?  It's an airport, open for all to see that walk by. It's not like it's on the wall in a bar.  We'll see if you care, and remove the stickers.

Obviously, not the best Mexican food you are ever going to find (come on people, it's an airport).   The service was fast and friendly. The prices for the portion size were fair - again, taking into consideration that you are stuck in an airport and they can basically charge whatever they want.   I've had a few different items from Sir Veza's over time and throughout many travels. On my most recent trip, I ordered the carnitas breakfast burrito.

I opted for a turkey sausage burrito which was like $11.   I received an incorrect order to start (bacon and something else) and the remake was terrible. Barely lukewarm, and bad quality ingredients. You know the \"free hotel breakfast\" quality? Yeah, take those powdered eggs, sketchy sausage and wrap that shit in a tortilla and charge people $11.   Cashiers were not especially pleasant and rather snotty about a remake, requiring my receipt to be produced. If you're hungry there are few options nearby and all are terrible. Choose whatever you think will make you the least frustrated.",

That and the ability to leave an airport eatery with fairly interesting food and a good beer for $15 is pretty good.   The style of the place is a hipster chipotle. Flavor is pretty good and not that inventive. Options are tacos, burritos and bowls w/ the same meat options as chipotle. So why not go to chipotle?  2 reasons, 1. There isn't one and 2. The beer. Again the beer.  So they have 20 different beers on tap, locales and national micro brews. They allow taste before you buy and are pretty good.   3 on its merits, 4 because of an airport.",

She was still angry and told a manager, that came over for her employees defense (and not an advocate for the business, customer, or even general ETHICAL values), minimized the whole thing and just asked us to move. Needless to say, we left and did not get to try the food for fear of retaliation. The lack of customer service and professionalism is definitely a huge problem. The serious anger/mental health issues of the employee should be a concern to everyone. We couldn't even get in the door and give them our money before their collection of horrible employees showed us we probably shouldn't. At the very least I appreciate that.

The prices are fair given that everything in the airport is pricier.   We got the chicken bacon quesadilla, the chicken bowl, and the hot dog.  The hot dog was exceptional but the other two items were average.   I would highly recommend their fish tacos!",

I had the carne asada and it was overcooked and dry, I had to add 2 sauces packs and a ton of hot sauce to add flavor. For the pros, it is a cool place to hang out if you have a long layover. Food was quick, friendly people, and tv to watch the game. If I was stuck in the terminal I would try again and order something different. Other people's food at the bar looked good.",

Deborah W recognized what I was omitting and with approval from her manager, changed it to \"sides\" instead, saving me some $ and time altering their menu item.

I was very disappointed that it took 20 minutes to get a small take out box of chips and a teeny bit of queso on top. Normally, the cheese is in a small container on the side, especially in an establishment like an airport, but they didn't care when I said I'd rather have it on the side. They were very rude when I complained that I didn't have enough queso for the amount of chips I got, and they continued to said it would be another $5 for more queso! The price was already outrageous so I couldn't justify it. I ate 1/4 of my dish and had to throw out the rest of the overly fried chips. One star only because of the convenience of being next to my gate. Otherwise the customer service is horrible- the ladies look at you like you're bothering them, and roll their eyes when you ask for some napkins! Like it's such an inconvenience. I will not return when I come back to this airport, that's for sure!",

After walking around checking out all the different restaurants in the terminal I finally found Sir Vesas.  There aren't too many good places to eat in this airport (but plenty of average ones) so I chose Sir Vesas for the three star average and their more than one Vegetarian Option. I ordered the Bean and Cheese Burrito and it was about $7 which isn't too expensive for airport food. The burrito was pretty good. Black beans, cheese, sour cream and salsa inside a flour tortilla. Nothing bad, nothing great. Just ok.  I might come back to Sir Vesas again if I was in the same terminal at Phoenix International. I wouldn't traverse multiple terminals to get here, but if I was there then it's not a bad option. They have a nice bar area as well as a small seating area which makes for a nice place to relax if you can find a spot.",

I feel like the price you pay is based on the meat, and if the meat is yucky, you just paid for pretty much nothing. Plus, they give you a little packet of salsa in a little plastic container like BBQ sauce from a fast food restaurant. That's when you know it's not good, fresh salsa, and you probably shouldn't open it unless you're desperate. I left mine in the bag. The price is rather high for what you get, which many reviews on here state. I should've read reviews prior to ordering, but it was enough food for me at that moment in time. I don't know when I'll be in Phoenix again, but I highly doubt I'd be going back to this place if I do.",

I ordered two chicken tacos with a side of black beans and rice. The tacos come wrapped in two soft corn tortillas (they also offer flour), grilled chicken topped with a chipotle crema, cilantro,  queso fresco, and fajita veggies. The crema had heat and made their salsa toppings irrelevant. The tacos are big so please don't be scared of the high price tag, you will be full.
