My friend and I stopped in for lunch yesterday while attending a convention and decided to give it a try. Our server was so good and super friendly and he constantly checked in on us. The food itself? Well I ordered the shrimp, pear and goat cheese salad with spiced pecans. There was barely any goat cheese and the shrimp was just okay... The picture in the menu looked really good but the actual was just okay. I was slightly saddened by this.. My friend's mahi burger seemed much better. I will definitely either order a burger, or something else next time because I was hoping for something more. On the upside, my Arnold Palmer drink was very refreshing and good!",

We were a lil late to the game, but with the service we received we will definitely come here again for pre game drinks and food.",

    "text": "I went to the Phoenix Hard Rock Cafe for lunch on a Friday. It wasn't very busy, so I figured I would sit at the bar. The two servers/bartenders were super nice and friendly. So was management that I spoke with so I have nothing negative to say about the service. It was quick and friendly.   But the menu! It sucks! It is way overpriced! And nothing I had was good. For $10 I got the worst plate of nachos I have ever had! Sure it was big and plenty to share and even more to throw out, but it was awful. Glad I didn't pay another $4 for meat because it was so bad that even meat could not improve it! The beans had no flavor, the jalapeno provided the only bit of flavor to the plate. The salsa was pure trash- more live crushed tomatoes and no flavor! You would think in the SW they could at least adapt and go with a better salsa!   My other pick was potato skins, I love the things. The guy next to me ordered them, $9 for a half plate of the tiny-est potatoes I think anyone could skin! I think there were 6 halves but certainly not more than 8 halves, all the size of a child's palm!   I had a frozen drink called a Pickled Tink $6.75. Awful! Did not come completely mixed and barely pink. Tasted overwhelmingly of the coconut flavor. It was frozen and slushy and weak enough to feed to a kid. If I had one with me I would have let him/her have it, seriously.   It was my birthday as was maybe 4 other unfortunate souls to be eating there. They gave us each a Sundae with fudge on the whip cream and a small candle. They shouted at the patrons to to shoot Happy Birthday at each of us at separate times and clap. It was pretty weak by the third attempt to get participation.  It was nice of my servers to surprise and acknowledge me. Though I was not looking for any handout or commotion. I had a few bites of the sundae and it was even awful! The ice cream was full of ice crystals!   So over all I will have to disagree with others and say Applebee's food is much, much better and not as expensive! To Applebee's I'll return but to the HRC, this is my last visit.   Years ago I went to the Phoenix HRC when it was on Camelback, if I remember the street correctly. The building & bar was more impressive as was the decor and so was the food. I went on a birthday then too, I wonder why they moved to this location? The entry is nothing eye catching or grand as it was then. In fact if the Light Rail driver had not announced it i would not have seen it as I had not seen it on previous trips to and pass the area.   Before this stop at the HRC, I had been a fan of the place for years. Had once spent many evenings at the Boston HRC when I lived in MA and had fond memories of the old Phoenix location as well. But just as the music we call Rock has deteriorated so has this conglomeration! So long fair well HRC, I withdraw my support of you.",

The burgers at lunch are great but what I like best is how cold they keep their beer. You're thinking, \"So the Hard Rock has cold beer, big whoop.\" Well think again, Sport. Undercooled (totally a word) draft beer is an epidemic, even more so during the summer months when cooling systems are working triple hard.   I've been in this Hard Rock dozens of times but I never tire of the memorabilia, especially the Prince homage that stares you in the mug right when you walk in the door. The only thing I do tire of is the stale loop of videos that play on the monitors. I'm a music snob and Taking Back Sunday clips bore the crap out of me.   The staff works really hard and can jive talk with the best of 'em. Stop in, say hello, and order a ice cold brew (if you're old enough... they'll check).",

It's located across from the stadium so very convenient on game nights, but also close to the PHX Convention Center where our conference was.   We went at lunch and there was little to no crowd, so we were seated immediately by a great guy named Cody who works in the gift shop as well as waits on customers.   It was my friend's first visit to Hard Rock and Cody made it special for both of us. He gave us lots of details about the food. She ordered the chicken strip appetizer and he told her that it was kind of spicy- she's not a spicy fan, so he had the cook serve her the kid's version of the chicken tenders instead. I got the grilled veggie sandwich, which was on texas toast and had mushrooms and veggies and lots of cheese. Mine also came with fries, but you can upgrade to a salad or onion rings. I wasn't super hungry, so my friend and I shared the fries.   Our food was great, and we also bought some gifts. HRC even has a few clearance items and they have cute shirts, including ladies cut. The shirts were some of the best PHX souvenirs we saw for the price. The service was quick and we were finished and back at our conference without having to wait too long, and of course the atmosphere was typical Hard Rock Cafe with lots of great music.   I would definitely return to this Hard Rock Cafe.",

We ordered the Texan sandwich, the Honey Mustard grilled chicken sandwich, and a kids cheese pizza. The food arrived cold, and although the sandwiches still tasted good regardless of the temperature, the kids pizza was wretched. It tasted like they spooned tomato paste into the dough and sparsely dropped cheese on it.  This took 45 minutes to get this food.   I guess I'd be ok with that if I hadn't paid almost $14 for a chicken sandwich that was only ok. I could've paid less for fast food and and been just as happy. I do love the theme there, but the service didn't even justify the food. The server left us with empty drinks and pretty much didn't come back until she dropped off the check. Everyone has a bad night but they weren't even that busy. For good reason, I guess.",

I think that location has since closed, so it is probably a good thing that I don't eat at these places.   No, I go for the t-shirts. Recently, I have been going just for the polo shirts and always as presents for the hubby. He has the same polo shirts from Hard Rock except from different cities: Miami, San Antonio, Helsinki, just to name a few in his extensive collection from my travels. Since his birthday is this month, I had to visit this store to pick up his present.   I almost hyperventilated when I saw \"the\" polo shirt was on sale. Sadly, his size was the only one sold out, but that didn't stop me. After all this is a tradition. Right next to the \"sale\" polos was the new model of basically the same shirt. Success!",

Came here for lunch one day while wandering around the Superbowl festivities. For how many people were in the city, and how busy it was, we were shocked to immediately be sat. The restaurant is laid out very well; pretty open, lots of tables, big bar, and small outdoor seating area out front.  Took a few minutes for our server to come by, but it was crazy busy so it's completely understandable. My family of three split a large Chicken Caesar Salad, and a Club Sandwich. More than enough food; large portions. There was SO much turkey on the club, we ended up taking a few pieces off and tossing them in our salad for some extra flavor! Just a tip, ask them to go easy on the salad dressing; it was a bit overwhelming as it dripped off my pieces of lettuce.  The server was friendly, made conversation with us, and was pretty quick. Sad face for his hat though - he was a Patriots fan! Boo! Go Hawks! :)  While waiting for your food, make sure you look around at all of the music memorabilia. I saw stuff from Kiss, David Bowie, and many more!",

The food is not even okay, it's like whatever the opposite of very okay is. Not okay? It's not sickening, but it certainly is not okay. The fries suck, the honey mustard is wack, and the burger tastes like nail polish remover. Furthermore, the server will only talk to you if need be or if you look like you want to leave and NEVER refill your drink. Overall, I cannot stress enough how much this place sucks. It sucks so much, everything about it sucks, and I also suck but not as much as this place sucks. Please go somewhere else so your friends don't annoy you the whole car ride home for making this stupid suggestion! If you don't heed my review, and this place does suck, then you deserve to be made fun of by your friends because ultimately you also suck.",

I asked him if I could get a couple of menus and also have someone please head over and take our order. He said he would be right over.  About 5 minutes later, he came by and said he would be helping us and then said to look over the menu and he would be back. He quickly turned around and walked away. He never asked if he could start us off on something to drink. He just left.  Alright...anyway we looked over the menu and about 5 minutes later I looked around for him and he was behind the bar chatting with a few people. He was clearly not interested in helping us. Another few minutes went by and I said to my wife that we should leave.  We ended up leaving and on our way out I let the greeter know we were leaving because nobody bothered to help us. He shrugged his shoulders and didn't say a word.  Totally unprofessional on the greeter and a lack of customer service by the staff. I am sure glad the Tilted Kilt was nearby.",

Our waiter was Louis. He was on it!! He was super friendly & helpful. And quick & efficient. The manager Jennifer was awesome.  We came back next day for lunch because Jennifer said they had live music on the patio. There came up an incident on another table. The manager Jennifer took care of it with ease. I would recommend this restaurant and their staff any day. Thanks for making our girls weekend memorable",

Often I sit at the bar where conversations are pleasant and non-intrusive.  The food-drinks-service is tops in my book and I highly recommend a visit to HRC-Phoenix.    Thanks ! NC",

We were staying in Scottsdale and had a very hard time finding this Hard Rock Cafe. We finally arrived only to wait about one and half hours to be seated. We were not even there at a \"rush\" time; or not that one would think it would be. We arrived about 4pm or so and still had the long wait. I wanted a T-shirt from there because I collect them from every \"Hard Rock\" cafe that we visit!    So we finally got seated and I wanted this 4 cheese Lasagna that they have at every one of these chain restaurants. I did get it but it was a bit on the smaller size in appearance and taste and on the larger side in price. I'm not so sure it was worth the long drive, the wait time and then the meal wasn't quite satisfying.  But to defend this classic spot, I have to say that the atmosphere, of course, was rockin! There was some great memorabilia to look at and alot of things to buy at the little store...if you could \"squeeze\" in amoung the crowds!!     I guess I would say if you are a fan of \"Hard Rocks\" then you should go, because this  \"IS\" the Phoenix one.  The food is about the same as all the others but like I said, it seemed a bit on the \"smaller\" side in portion. I still always enjoy trying the new places out and the old ones and checking out all of the Hard Rock's to see what kind of paraphanalia they have hanging around..",

We didn't argue just ordered our food and quickly left. The promotional gift cards we were unsing supposedly didn't work. But she did go in the back and get some that did. She was rude, curt and generally unfriendly. I dunno what made her think we were intoxicated. She didn't even turn around and look at us before denying us alcohol. We are in our mid 30's middle class normal parents out for a night without the kids. Will not be returning. No wonder they hand out the promotional gift cards like they are nothing.",

There were several flat screen TVs with music videos playing...not too loud.  A couple of other screens along the wall had the local March Madness basketball games playing.  We were there three hours before the Lady Gaga concert, and the other patrons were fun and diverse!    FOOD:  We had the \"Big Cheese Burger\" and \"Grilled Veggie Sandwich.\"  For drinks, we were excited to have a \"Bahama Mama\" and \"Blackberry Smash!\"  I was sad when I found out they were out of the Balsamic Tomato Bruschetta.  We ate every bite!!  There was not a crumb remaining!  VERY GOOD!  PARKING:  There is a parking garage just a couple of blocks away.  We were staying at a hotel which included parking in the garage; therefore, I'm not sure of the garage rates.  I would recommend parking there when in the area.      PERKS:  Location, location, location!  SERVICE:  The waitress was friendly and very efficient.  Even though it was getting busier each minute we were there, she was very responsive to our table!  VERY happy!  CONCLUSION:  For event nights, DEFINITELY get there at 5 pm.  If you wait until 6 pm or later, it will be quite crowded.  The location alone makes this place perfect for dinner and drinks before attending games/concerts.  I will be back!",

It's definitely another one of those places that seemed like it had better food when I was a younger kid. The burger is very basic and unmemorable. My wife got the fajitas, which were actually kind of gross. We did enjoy the potato skins that we ordered as appetizers though, so the meal wasn't a complete waste.

The food has come a long way in the 30+ years I have been going to the HRC.  The ribs were very tasty and had enough BBQ sauce in where it was not dry.  The chicken was actually moist and tasty as well.  Chicken seems to be a crutch for all establishments.   Very simple dish, but one of the hardest to cook and cook well.  The Fry's were done perfect.  The two downfalls were the salad and desert.  The salad was very small and nothing to it and we paid extra for that.  When you pay for a salad that is not included in the meal, you expect a decent sized salad.  This was not.  The desert (Apple Cobbler) was not cooked all the way.  The pastry dough was still dough.  Ugggggg!  I would have given my visit three stars instead of 4, but the service and entree were quite good.  Good memorabilia displayed as well.",

He pawned us off to another server, twice, and although we were seated in the bar area, still felt the need to completely IGNORE our request to refill our drinks. He acted like he was immensely busy when he had maybe 7 other drinks, 4 of which were already made bottles of beer...his conversations were inappropriate (who cares about your 3rd divorce) and he was slow at making something as simple as a coke and vodka. By far the worst bartender with the least amount of customers present.  Thank Goodness for \"Marty\" who had 9 other tables to pick up the slack of this worthless bartender.",

The bartender said it's not a sports bar  Doesn't have to be.  But why then is it across the street from the Phoenix Suns in the Arizona Diamondbacks arenas?  Putting one or two TVs out of the 10 or 12 they have in the place on a sports channel, I don't think it's too much to ask.   apparently he did.  Nothing like catering to your customers.

From the moving of The Stones memorabilia to a better spot, to every single morsel of every bite of food being tasty, to the attentive server has changed not just for the better but for the best. After an attentive manager read my last review and encouraged me to try again, I'm so glad I did. I had the Cowboy Ribeye with Caesar salad and garlic mashed potatoes; the roasty garlic potatoes were so good and soaked up some of the perfectly seasoned buttered steak that was seared nicely and had the perfect amount of pink that I ordered. My friend's salmon meal is pictured with a piece of it missing since she couldn't wait for me to take the picture as it looked so good and she had to grab an immediate bite--her broccoli was bright green yet not tough. Her warm apple cobbler had to travel home as did my Oreo cheesecake, but that just prolonged the delicious experience. The only thing we could think of that would've improved the meal was if there would have been a warm roll before the meals came, and if they would offer straws only upon request instead of serving the water with straws already in them since we really should be more sensitive to needless waste. I'm so glad I was encouraged and generously incentivized to return. We shall return!",

Buy a beer, walk around and see some dead guys' guitars. Done. At least, that's what I observed might have been cool to do when I ended up there after the Depeche Mode concert across the street @ US Airways Center (I miss BOB, it made it so much more personable, but anyway).    So, DM let out about quarter til 11, and my group all decided to go grab one @ the Hard Rock, and maybe get something to eat. When we walked up, 2 blonde waitrons were at the door, holding it open for us, saying \"Just so you know we just called last call, and aren't serving food. In fact, we should already be closed.\" CHARMED! So, a music-themed restaurant/bar, located directly across from an arena that frequently hosts ummm, CONCERTS, wouldn't plan to capitalize on the outflow of excited music fans and perhaps stay open  and make some monayyy? OK. As a bartender, I'd have insisted that it be so. This summer sucked for the service industry, and I found it so surprising that such an establishment wouldn't have been more malleable to perhaps retain and dare I say, boost the morale of their  staff by anticipating and catering to a late crowd of people who'd rather spend $5 (ok, $5.46) as opposed to $11 @ the arena for some post-concert frosty bevs. Have a little bump in their take-home scrilla for the night, and I dunno, fun? Meh.  And there were about 15 other people in there at the bar, too. The only person there who was workin it was the bartendress, though, she too, seemed like she was a bit put-out that she had a bunch of customers come in last-minute. I do give her props for salting the rim of my pint glass and pouring a DosXX for me without having the salt volcano all the beer out of the glass.   Maybe it's the corporate management bs that was in the way. Maybe not. Either way, they need to get it together on the hospitality tip.",

My first impression is that it's smaller then I thought it would be, but it's still pretty roomy the way the tables are spaced out. This is a great place to go if you are going to attend a concert or basketball game at the US Airways center (directly across the street) or Chase Field where the Diamondback's play. Overall, it has a pretty neat atmosphere with everything being music related. Lot's of guitars and gold records along with pictures cover most of the walls. be prepared, it is very loud in there. Music videos will be playing. This does not bother me, but you may have to raise your voice to be heard.  Now, onto he food. My wife and I had already eaten, so we ordered an appetizer of chicken lettuce wraps. Nothing to complain about. Eveything was fresh and the layout of the food was appealing. Ordered and iced tea that was better then most places. We also had a great waiter...don't recall his name though. Prices are a little high, but it is geared towards being different and your probably paying  for that. I would go back again, but I would not just drive into Phoenix just to eat there on a whim. Maybe next time I go to a D'backs game or the Roger Waters concert in May.",

The location is great and it is a good place to grab a bite before a game.  The food is standard.  Never great, never bad.  Just across the board decent.  My problems with this HRC start with the layout.  The circular design is really bad for traffic flow, seating, wait staff movement, and sound.  This HRC lacks a True performance space which is terribly lame.  The bar is off to the side instead of being in the middle like almost every other HRC.  The shop is way too small and the merchandise is pretty lame.  This HRC is always so loud that it is impossible to have a conversation with your group.    The other problem I have with this HRC stems from an incident where my wife and I went before a game.  She left her hat on the seat when we left and we remembered about 100 yards down the road.  Turned around, went back in, and told the hostess.  She said she would check and then she came back and said they didn't find anything.  I argued with her because we had JUST LEFT and finally went back to our table where it was still sitting in the bench.  Way to go idiot.",

Downtown Phoenix has no character and apparently the rest of the city does not have any either and that is very sad considering how big the city is. I think the only reason Hard Rock decided to put a cafe here is because the city is so big but nothing really great culturally. You don't here about the great music scene this town has so this cafe seems to stick out like a sore thumb in retiree central. Still it is nice to go something familiar and get the signature T-shirt.",

We had a great view of the band. Our chicken club sandwiches came with fries. Very good fries and the sandwich was large well cooked and seasoned. I would have it again! Word of caution, order it on softer bread. The toasted bread it comes on really tore up the roof of our mouths! The dessert shots (Creme brulee and chocolate mousse) were delicious but very rich. Our waitress came often and was a great personality. I believe her name is Shirley. If you go and take a table for three hours tip well!",

The night before, I was craving mac and cheese and when i saw it on the menu, I was so happy. I ordered a side. My server was great btw.   The burger was ok, nothing special. It wasnt very juicy, and they didnt provide much more than a piece of lettuce tomato and mustard and ketchup. Overall pretty boring and non-cravable. The mac and cheese, however was great. It had red pepers with a little kick.   It was a chain, been to one, you know what to expect.",

We smiled and said yes. The decor was alright, everything you'd think of when you think Hard Rock. But nothing really stood out to me. It was like applebee's with more expensive wall art. The menu looked good, especially the drinks. I didn't try any of them. But they did sound good.   Over all, it was alright. But $30 for a couple of sandwiches and sodas?!?! I don't know about that! And even then, I barely got a handful of fries!! It so wasn't worth it!   It's a wonderful location and it is clean. That's a big deal to me! I'd go back, but I don't think I'd go before a game!

Not to mention the fact that there is a $3 charge for an upgrade to onion rings when each person at my table had exactly 6 onion rings on their plate!  Yes, that's right 1 burger, with 6 onion rings= $17.00.  Lame!!  This Hardrock is wack in ambiance too!  It is small and boring inside.  The music was barely audible and what I could hear was some terrible pop music that I had never heard before.  The servers must love there job though, the tab suggests a tip of 20%, exactly what you should tip on your $17 burger with 6 onion rings.  The server seemed sweet until she tried twice to upsell us an overpriced dessert.  Save your money and find somewhere else to dine.  Seriously not worth the 30 min wait and messy restroom either!",

The waiter was very attentive, but not overbearing. Food came out in around ten minutes.   Food: Got a burger, which was perfectly cooked, and fries that were seasoned nicely.   Overall: The Hard Rock is a great place to go, even though it's a little pricey for what you get. The fact of the matter is that there just aren't many other decent places to eat in the downtown area when you want something quick and easy. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if you're in the area, I'd recommend it.",

    "text": "Sunday. 6:20pm. Downtown following another amazing Mercury victory.  Hungry.  Group includes toddler. We'd like to walk to food but it's warm so we can't walk far.  It's sad how few options actually presented themselves.  We tried Coach and Willy's first, but as of 6:10 their kitchen was closed.  So, we were led back to Hard Rock Cafe.  I've been here several times after games and all for the same reasons.  It's close. We didn't feel like parking again. The food is ok.  Think Apple-bee's for a few bucks more.  But service unfortunately has been a regular issue.  One of the last times we were there we advised our server that we needed to be out the door in 45 minutes.  We asked what food we could order to ensure that it would be fast.  To his credit he checked in the kitchen.  After immediately ordering a sandwich and salad, the food arrived 5 minutes before we were supposed to walk out the door with no apology (and a server who hid from us for most of that time). We were 15 minutes late leaving just trying to get to-go containers and our bill.    This time - our service was actually wonderful.  Our server was great.  Happy, conversational, refilled drinks much more than usual though the place was quite busy with post-game activity.  The problem came when she had to leave to move her car. You see, with D-Back and Merc games, parking was expensive and full so she had to park several blocks away where the gate closed promptly at 8pm, which we totally understood.  And even though we all saw her handing us off to the manager after handing us the check (she pointed to our table several times) no one came to our table.  Well, after flagging down a hostess, a bus boy and another server who all said they would look for the manager, and we did see them scurrying around looking for the manager, it took 25 minutes to find her and have her walk over to the table.  That's 25 extra minutes with a toddler who was getting tired. How much did we love that? Finally, as our waitress walked back into the building 30 minutes after she left, we were finally paying our bill and leaving the table.  She was so apologetic.   She was wonderful.  The fact that we heard from several folks there that waiting 20 minutes to FIND the manager was not out of the norm was scary.   They have such an amazing location in the heart of the action after events.  Their food is decent enough that I'd be willing to grab something there again purely for convenience if only I knew what to expect when it came to the service.  But unfortunately - I can't.",

It was good for the $4 I paid, but not the $15+tax and tip it was normally.  The cons: - The customer service was laughable. Our waiter come up to my guest and I, who both had empty drinks at the time, and said \"Good? Good?\" with thumbs up. My guest asked for a refill and specified that I needed one, too. Later in the meal when both of our drinks were totally empty again, I asked for a refill. He only brought one for me, so my guest and I shared my drink. He clearly couldn't care less.  - The burger was dry, like it was previously frozen. It definitely didn't taste fresh. - The veggies on the side to put on the burger weren't crisp. I usually like lettuce on my burger, but not their wilted lettuce. - The fries weren't seasoned and they weren't anything special. I'd compare them to Wendy's fries.  - The music videos they play are awful. For being the Hard Rock Cafe you'd think that they'd play some well known rock stuff. ...nope... my guest and I were there for almost two hours and there was only one song we recognized. While I'm not a music expert, my guest is. To top it off, their bad music is so loud that you have to yell to talk to someone across the table. I expected loud music at the Hard Rock Cafe, but not bad loud music.",

    "text": "Props to the Hard Rock Cafe, for doing exactly what I was sure they couldn't do! On our way to a Suns game, my hockey buddy and I were searching for a place to grab a quick bite to eat. We got off the light rail at 7:35, wandered until we decided to give the Hard Rock a try, and were seated right away.  Trust me, we passed a lot of options along the way to the arena. Most of them were unappealing or way too busy. One place actually told us they could seat us right away, but it would be a 45 minute wait for food... Okay, next!  Our server Lizzy was great! When she greeted us, I told her we were on our way to an 8:30 game. She was enthusiastic, promptly took our order and delivered our drinks. It was barely after 7:40 now.  It's been a while since I last visited a Hard Rock Cafe (in California). The atmosphere is still fun, especially when you appreciate the genre to which every Hard Rock is an homage. Plus, I'd forgotten the unique collection of musical items on display. Now back to the food!  It wasn't long before Lizzy appeared with our entrees. My Guinness Bacon Cheeseburger was delicious and the kitchen nailed the temp. My burger still had a little pink in the middle. My buddies nachos were generous and delicious too! Lizzy knew we were in a hurry and quickly delivered our check too. Seriously, ask for Lizzy!  I felt it was deserving to acknowledge the Hard Rock Cafe for providing great service, a fun atmosphere, tasty food and all at a lunch time pace. By the time we walked across the street, we still had time to get to our seats in time for the National Anthem. Thanks Hard Rock! 'Merica!",

My friend got the mushroom and swiss burger, which I guess was the \"legendary burger\" at the time. Both came with their regular seasoned french fries. Understandably, service was a little slower since we got there later in the evening and it was a busy night to begin with. We had fun looking at all the memorabilia on the walls while we waited though. It was a little more meat than I could handle, but it was good and cooked to my liking. Came out to $15.11 after tax for just my order, so a little more on the expensive side but arguably we were satisfied enough that dessert was not necessary",

    "text": "Ha! It had been at least a decade since I was in a Hard Rock Cafe. I guess I forgot about them after Bruce Willis and Demi Moore divorced? ;). This was the only restaurant with available reservations before a local concert, so I booked it with limited expectations. Well, there was a party going on here and it exceeded my expectations. Good food with generous portions, fun and friendly staff, fun and strong drinks. It was a winner! I enjoyed my bbq bacon cheese burger. The burger was juicy, loosely packed and perfectly cooked. I was able to substitute broccoli for fries. My friend really enjoyed her large  serving of macaroni and cheese with grilled chicken. There was a DJ somewhere that kept the party going. Great pre-event option in the area.",

It was poor planning on management part as they were under staffed.

    "text": "Average Visit  It has been years since I visited the Hard Rock Cafe, even though I work in the downtown area.  Hardrock Cafe has a nice vibe and serves the typical \"American Pub\" fare, like burgers, fries, salads, and sandwiches coupled with an atmosphere of rock music and music memorabilia displayed throughout the restaurant.    Hardrock Cafe even has a store for the obligatory \"Hard Rock Cafe\" T-shirt or other Hard Rock trinkets.  The staff at HRC are friendly and accommodating and seem to really enjoy their jobs.  Each person with whom we interacted seemed genuinely interested in talking to us and making our meal and visit memorable.    On this visit my lunch companions and I ordered the Classic Hard Rock Nachos, Pulled Pork Sandwich,  Beans, Fries, Original Legendary Burger, Coleslaw, Twisted Macaroni and Cheese with Chicken, and Chicken Cesar Salad.  I have to be honest I wasn't impressed with any of the entrees. The entrees werent bad, its just that the entrees werent very good.  The Nachos were piled high, however, lacked toppings. The burger and pulled pork, once again werent bad, just average at best, nothing stood out. The Bbq beans were overcooked and dry, and the coleslaw had a bitter taste. My lunch companion said the macaroni and cheese were okay as was the Chicken Cesar Salad.   I guess I was expecting more for the price we paid and Hard Rock fell short of those expectations. I guess most people visit Hard Rock for the rock & roll atmosphere and the drinks.",

Number 1 reason to drive downtown for happy hour - the bartenders Javier and Eddie.  They have incredible memories and pick up the conversation you ended with the last time you were there, and that could have been 8 months ago.  They are quick with the drinks and with their wit.   The food is ok and over-priced, but that comes with the HRC name.  We have found the entire staff to be friendly and accommodating.  A neighborhood HRC bar...hmmmm.  Sure feels like it.",

Went with a party of 7 and we were smart to use their Please Excuse service found on the website so that we could cut to the front of the line before the Suns game.   The place was busy and our server appeared capable, but looks can be deceiving. As it turns out, service was what it usually is, slow. We had a mixture of sodas, water, beer, and mixed drinks at our table and unless we ASKED for a refill, it wasn't coming. We would have spent more on alcohol if the server seemed remotely interested in serving us.  Our appetizers took FOREVER to come out. Meanwhile glasses sat empty on the table. The appetizers finally came--we ordered the sampler tray and a chicken quesadilla. It was tasty. Nothing special. The potato skins were particularly notable though as they were perfectly done and NOT greasy. Refills FINALLY came after we had to ask twice for them.   Dinner comes out before the appetizer dishes were cleared and we were starting to have an excessive amount of glasses and bottles on the table that the server didn't feel necessary to remove from the table. *sigh*  Most of us had burgers and they were all just basic burgers. I had the california burger and it was a big sloppy mess. Someone had the bright idea of putting the guac on the burger before the cheese. The cheese is the glue and the guac goes on the bun. As soon as I attempted to pick it up to eat, everything slid all over and I ended up having to eat it with a fork and knife. The fries were bland. And we waited again and again for refills.  It's conveniently located right across the street from the Suns arena and I think this is really the last time I\"m going to subject myself to this place. I've been to MANY HRC's across the globe and this one is the worst one.   Can't SOMEONE put a decent place in downtown Phoenix? PLEASE!",

Usually we are only going to get a guitar pin from the different cities we visit because we know the food isn't that good.  The food is never bad, it's just never that good.  Almost ever single time we go here, which I swear is too often, I order the Twisted Mac and Cheese.  I get this for two reasons.  One, I love mac and cheese, and two, I love cavatappi pasta.  HR's version of the classic cheesy pasta is a mildly spiced cheese sauce that lightly coats the curly pasta.  Don't expect to have a thick and creamy mac and cheese here.  You won't be getting that.  The pasta is then topped with the expected dry piece of blackened chicken.  Why expected?  It's expected because I have literally been to HR's all over the country, on both coasts, and every single one serves dry chicken.  I guess that's what they teach at the HR School of Cooking.  I guess they just put more focus on music than food.  Who knows.  Why I gave HR three stars I will never know.  Why I keep going back is certainly beyond my capacity to understand.  Maybe they put crack in the mac.  That would explain why I order it time and time again.  If you haven't been, I suggest going just once.  It's fun to compare all the different HR's.",

I didn't have the food but one can assume that its like all HRC - a little better than Applebees at twice the price.    I was once at a HRC (Memphis?  Vegas?

I didn't mind my overpriced drink that visit.  Unfortunately I walked around the PHX HRC and thought 'They bothered to hang that up?'.  This location could use some Help! in more ways than one.",

If I knew before I went in there I would be paying $16.00 for macaroni and cheese, and had the pleasure of waiting around for an hour to get it, while my glass remained empty, I would've stayed away (which is what you should do).  Food wasn't awful, although 2 members of the party did cut up their mouths eating the hard as a \"Rock\" bread on their sandwiches. The mac n' cheese was nothing special.  The service was beyond poor.  First and last time I will eat at Hard Rock Cafe.",

Appetizers:   Jumbo Combo - Get it. It was pretty good as far as appetizer combos go. Spring Rolls (my fave), Chicken Wings, Onion Rings, Potato Skins and Chicken Tenders. Plenty of dipping sauces.   Main Course:  California Chicken Club Sandwich - wasn't bad! I don't remember finishing it, so I guess it was just OK.   Drinks:  I can't remember the drink. Possibly lemonade. However, the server gave me the option to upgrade with a souvenir HRC logo tall glass! I went for it! Love the glass (just used it today).   Service:   Seemed fine until she dropped a ramekin of jalapenos behind my chair. Had jalapeno juice on my shoe, pants and jacket! She said sorry, but that kinda sucked.   Bathroom:   Clean. A little dark, but clean (at least the areas I could see - LOL).   Atmosphere:   Just like every other HRC in the U.S. Nothing new.  Next time, we'll skip this chain and just ask the locals where's a good place to eat.",

The food is average and the drinks aren't anything out of the ordinary. Infact, there's nothing really unique about the Hard Rock aside from the fact that they jacked up the prices because you're dining and/or drinking at the HARD ROCK CAFE.   I'm disappointed that it doesn't compare to others around the world and seems out of place in Phoenix. A Hard Rock Scottsdale would be way cooler.",

The french fries were very good. The waitress was friendly and kept our drinks filled. For dessert we had the begger bag (I think that is what it was called) - you know, the hot cookie and ice cream combo. It was very good! I don't venture inside many Hard Rocks, the only other one I can recall being in was in the Bahamas, but I don't have a reason to avoid it. It is a little higher priced for a burger than other places, but you are paying for the atmosphere as well.",

Didn't mind the 10 minute wait and the staff was extra friendly. Wait staff very attentive and it didn't take long to get our food. I had chicken tenders and their coating was unique but good. The best part was the dipping sauce. Wife had shrimp and replaced side with broccoli (they were out of mashed potatoes). The food was seasoned and cooked well but the shrimp was a bit greasy. Prices are what you expect at this type of restaurant/attraction. The place is clean but they really need to fix their chairs and tables. Tables wobbled all through meal. I tried to put napkins under one leg to help balance it out. The chairs are weak and leave you feeling a bit unsafe as well. Best thing about the night was my company, the staff, and the food in that order.  Yes I would come back. Hope I can enjoy the place without playing handyman.",

The whole reason we ventured out was for cobbler (see review on Karim's Cobbler Shop & deli for debacle)and lo and behold Hard Rock was offering Apple Cobbler. The day was not wasted. I opted for the spicy chicken mac 'n cheese and I was not disappointed.. it had a kick to it. It is rare to experience True flavor at a chain so I was extremely pleased. They could have thrown in a bit more chicken but in their defense I did order the side not the meal. But the side was plenty filling. Onto dessert. oooh the fabulous cobbler crunchies....imagine me squeal with delight. Apple wouldnt  have been my first choice but it was damn good. Revenge is mine Karim! Thank you Hard Rock for saving the day.",

    "text": "I am a big fan of HRC - love the food, the ambiance & the staff.   I don't think I've had a bad experience in all my travels & visits.  The Phoenix location is a bit quieter than most but that improves as the downtown area becomes busier.  I had company in from out of town so we made the trip down in between lunch & dinner.  There was a ballgame starting at 5pm and we wanted to make sure we were out of there before the crowds hit.    We were seated right away on the main floor.  We weren't there for drinks so we had water & Arnold Palmers.  My beau drinks a lot (he works outside so it's residual) -  so he can keep the server occupied with drink refills most nights but Kendra was all over that.  He didn't have to ask for a refill once - she was on top of his glass & had a new one ready just as he finished up.    We ordered wings to start.  I'm not a wing connoisseur by any means, but the wings at the HRC are my favorite.  I love the mix of drumsticks & paddles.  They are always very meaty with just enough buffalo flavor.  They serve them with blue cheese (as they should!!!) and a mix of celery and carrots.  Delish!    For our meals we ordered a 1/2 slab of ribs w/fries, a side of twisted mac & cheese, a cheeseburger with fries & a steak salad.  All were great.  My burger was juicy (I ordered it med well & it was perfect) and very flavorful.  The ribs were meaty looking & smelled like they had been smoked all day.  The steak on the salad looked cooked to perfection with big hunks of blue cheese & onion strings.  We ordered a dessert (so two of us brought food home) and shared the apple cobbler.  It was big enough for 4 people to share.  Great flavor, nice drizzle of caramel on top of the ice cream scoop (perfect temp against the oh so hot out of the oven cobbler).  Perfect ending to a great meal.    Staff at the location was super friendly & helpful - from the host seating us, servers & food runners, to the gift shop employee that made some great recommendations.  Thanks for a great afternoon!",

We walked in and I told them table for 3...I dont know what was going on between the host up front but the dude came back and slammed menus on the host station...should have left after that but I thought everyone has a bad day. They sat us at a little table by the bar.  The kind of table that is ment for people to drink not a table for dinner.  Our waitress came off as rude from the get go. We ordered appetizers and drinks. When they came my table was full. My server was never around so I asked a host if i could move to an open booth and she said \"I cant do that but I'll try find you a table\" okay.  I notice there was a table below us that had a cup of whip cream on it since we sat down.  That is the table we were sat at after they took the cup away.  It was better but it gave my server a reason to ignore me.  I noticed she had a big table to deal with amd after they left she came and got my order.  So we got our food and we ate food was good.  But what I noticed was no one was bussing tables.  A family came in and didnt like the table against the wall they were offered and asked to sit where the big party was...the host said I cant sit you at a dirty table...they said they would wait....that table has been dirty of at least half an hour...and the glass of whip cream that was on my table was still on the counter above my table when we left.  My daughter kept pointing at it saying it's still there. Makes me think about the cleanliness of the kitchen.",

Consistently good food, service & a fun atmosphere surrounded by some great rock & roll memories.    The Phoenix location was no exception.  On my first visit to any Hard Rock location, I tend to stick with one of two dishes.  This time, it was the Twisted Mac, Chicken & Cheese.  I was surprised by how spicy it was compared to how I've had it at other locations, but it was still great.  Of course there's a store, so stop by after you eat & take a look at the t-shirts, drum sticks, pins & other souvenirs. Lots to choose from!",

    "text": "The Hard Rock Cafe near the Phoenix Convention Center is overpriced for at best \"meh \"and at worst \"bad\" food. My friend and I came in on Saint Patrick's day and found it was mildly full, maybe 5-6 tables were occupied. We were quickly seated and our waitress (who's name eludes me. Her hair is shaved on the sides and she wore green gauges in her ears) promptly took our order. She was very nice and attentive. Without a doubt, she was the best part of this experience.   I ordered the \"Legendary Burger\", fries and with a side salad / Italian dressing. The price of $15.50 for a burger and $5.00 for the salad is pretty high. Neither were impressive. The salad, which I assumed would be a basic garden salad, was gross. Not because it wasn't fresh, it was just an odd choice of ingredients; Kale, Baby Spinach, some kind of seeds (pumpkin maybe... I don't know.), Diced tomatoes and carrots. Nothing outside of the tomatoes or carrots went with the dressing. Someone else might enjoy it, not me though.   The Burger on the other hand was terrible. The bun was so stale that it made a hard hollow sound when flicked. Also, it didn't dent, it cracked. When I pinched it, it instantly became bread crumbs. When I mentioned it, I received a slightly less stale bun to replace mine. In terms of burger quality (to which I am admittedly picky. I mainly do burger reviews), I found the meat to be unseasoned and bland. The toppings nor Chipotle aoli helped.   Overall, this was a pretty poor experience. While the staff was really good, this high prices and very poor quality of food really made this a bad time. I will not be coming back.",

The waitress however was very prompt and helpful. We had the cauliflower buffalo wings and those were pretty good. I recommend getting the buffalo sauce on the side. Just a heads up they say it's a mild buffalo sauce it tastes identical to Franks red hot sauce so if you don't like spice definitely get the sauce on the side.",

It was 11:30am when we stopped by on Saturday and people were starting to trickle in. The hostess who greeted us was very friendly. She took us to our seats and informed us she was going to be our waitress as well.   The menu has many different choices and the drinks are endless. Most of the drinks come with a souvenir cup so they are definitely worth it!   I ended up ordering the buffalo chicken wings with a side of the parmesan and garlic fries. I spent about $18.  The parmesan garlic fries were to die for!!! These are a must have! Oh and make sure to ask for ranch to dip them in! The wings (6 in the order) were so juicy and big! These wings were not at all tiny!   Our waitress was very friendly and patient! She checked up on us several times and always made sure we had what we wanted.   The decor is pretty cool inside and the bathrooms were very clean. Oh and the toilets are black! Yes black.",

Hadn't been to this one yet but they just had a ten minute wait so thought it would fit the bill.  Was seated in about ten minutes, but the table had obviously not been wiped down with bits of food still on the table.  The host wiped it down a little and then the server took our drink order which came out quick.  We then placed our food order and waited, and waited, and waited,....  The place looked half full and there were plenty of servers so not sure what was up unless most of the kitchen staff called in sick or something.  After 35 minutes, our food finally arrived.  I am still not sure if what I ate was chicken tenders or fish fillets, but I do know it was a little burnt.  Did not get the right dipping sauces either, but was afraid to ask for the correct ones as I didn't have another half-hour to wait.  Long story short, we should have waited the hour to eat at TGIF instead.",

My friend arrived early to try and snag us a table but when the pager went off they refused to sit her because there were only 2 ppl out of a 6 person group. They took away our spot and put us at the end of the que again. It took damn near an hour after that episode to just sit at a table. In fact a group of nice men offered us their table as they were leaving so we bypassed the hosts altogether (at that point they still had us for an additional 25 minutes).  Before we were sat we decided to grab something from the bar, there was only one bartender that I could see working; you can imagine the service wasn't quick.  Once sat we had a very nice waitress greet us and take our drink order. I shit you not, after waiting 15 minutes with no drinks we saw her look at our table and have a \"oh crap i forgot to ring their stuff in\" moment. I get it. Its insane busy before the concert and the dumb manager clearly understaffed. Once we finally got our drinks, things did seem to get smoother. Thats probably because most people had left at this point to go to the arena.  The wings were definitely good but others at the table remarked how their food was just barely warm. Not the greatest experience.",

I think it's obvious that if you go to any bar or restaurant outside a MLB baseball stadium which also host's concerts, that it's going to be busy and you're going to get slower service so arrive with time.   My BF and I have gone to this particular Hard Rock Cafe several times before D-Backs games and concerts for drinks and we have always had great service. While the restaurant and bar gets very busy on game or concert days, the service isn't as slow as other reviewers are making it seem.   If you want to make it to your event on time and plan on stopping at Hard Rock beforehand, expect a wait-time for a table and don't expect to be in and out of there an hour before your event for your table of 10. It's not going to happen, not even on a regular day. Plan ahead and quit being cry-babies just because you're the one running late.",

Place was about to close so it was pretty empty, but we stumbled through the door in single file ready to make it work!  The interior was actually pretty great. Nice wood floors and things that would catch your attention including a piano. We sat down at the bar and the excellent bartender took our first round and then the last call. Prices were pretty steep for shots, but the bartender pointed out that they were 50% off during that time which was great!  Had a great conversation with the bartender and not only that, but he gave us a free round as well as took shots with us so can't complain!  Looking forward to stopping by here again and trying out the food as well.  5 out of 5 stars",

I didnt even ask for water!  She had ZERO personality and was annoyed that I asked her for ketchup, mustard and salt and pepper.  Really!?

I asked for a root beer and a burger with no onions. The root beer came late and the burger came with onions. It may have been the kitchen's fault and the food was still good. The, who I am assuming was the manager, refilled our waters because the waitress was too busy doing whatever in the back. Never got a refill on the root beer, the drink I actually spend money on.

There is only 1 table in the WHOLE place - and the highlight of the group was the 100 year old dude wearing suspenders.    The bartender acted as if the vandal hordes had just descended on her.  Seriously, I think she thought she was done for the night.  She got pissy with our multiple orders, couldn't remember 2 drinks at a time, and generally was a pain in the ass.  None of the drinks stood out as anything fancy, so we started to pack up and leave.  While waiting for my friends to settle up, I stationed myself outside the door, and did some \"in person Yelping\"  - basically telling everyone thinking about walking in to run.    Well, I guess a drunk girl standing outside telling you not to enter is not a good deterrent for everyone.  Out of the 5 couples that came up (Conan O'Brian's show had just ended - go Team Coco!) 2 decided to try somewhere else on my words....smart people, they will go far in life.  The other 3 doubted my wisdom, and ventured inside.    All 3 walked out before the last of my friends did - every single one of them was stunned at how the single staff member working made them feel like they were intruding (I did exit polling) and decided that there must be another place in Downtown Phoenix on a Friday night that would like some money.",

    "text": "I'm not normally a patron of chain restaurants, but I went to Hard Rock Cafe downtown last week to see a local band, Super Stereo, perform there.  And actually, up until I bought the tickets for the show, I didn't even know Hard Rock allowed local bands to perform there.  That's pretty cool of them, and I respect that.  The beer selection was mediocre at best, the mushroom and swiss burger was tasty, and the server was kind and attentive.  I couldn't ask much more from Hard Rock so I won't.  If you're downtown and need a bite to eat, there are several better joints to check out.  However, if you have a specific reason to go to Hard Rock (like I did), go there and enjoy yourself.  You'll have a good time.  Oh, and Super Stereo kicked butt!  Check them out!!",

Been here 3 or 4 times to this location and the service here is the worst I think I have ever seen in such a long time. Each time a different problem has arisen and each time the management is worse then our server. This time was we had a portion of our food left on our plates. As we got up to mingle with friends I let our lovely server know we r not finished and we will be right back. We return to see the food taken away.  The server knows that's an issue so she gets the manager.  Instead of management going out of their way to please us, he argues that the plates were practically empty.  Way besides the point.  I asked that my food in which I paid for was not disturbed so regardless of what was left, how are u going to fix it... He then proceeded to think about how to fix it by talking w the server again.  I came up to their convo to say I'm not being picky or rude I would just like the rest of my 30$ steak.  They cooked us a less then worthy steak to replace it. Horrible service",

The hostess came to the store area and was extremely friendly! She explained some of the pins and made sure that I saw all the options available. I found one for my collection and was pleased to find one honoring the Year of the Horse (on sale too!) for my brother. The transaction was quick and we were out in a just a few minutes. The location is conveniently located in Downtown Phoenix across the US Airways Center. There is street parking available. I'm not sure if there is a parking structure available.",

After 30 minutes of waiting 3 people deep at the bar I was able to order drinks the bar tender was quick once she got to me! I've worked at a busy restaurant during times like this and know they were working their butts off! At an hour we were told we were next and they were bussing tables, after 15 more minutes there were 12+ clean open tables and they weren't seating anyone! The crowd had dies down as the concert had started but again we wanted to eat! We saw 3 ladies seat them selfs and told the manager they weren't leaving there were so many opened tables so I under stand the manager being bitchy to them. The host lets a lady in my party know she is pushing tables together for my party of 6 so after she does while the host is grabbing menus we sit down, we knew it was our table. The manager runs over to us and starts yelling at us and saying who sat you? Who told you you could move tables? We tell her the host did and she VERY snobby says then why don't you have menus? We let her know the host was grabbing them and we see her stomp up to the host and start screening at them. She comes back and starts putting knifes on the table and when she gets to me that let her know we waited an hour and a half and we did not seat our selfs she SLAMS my knife down and walks away. We all were in shock! I don't know how this lady ever has to deal with any customer she should not be interacting with anyone! Maybe she can be the late night manager that deals with the drunks at last call but she should NEVER work treat customer that are there for dinner that way! We ordered right away drinks and food the server was kind, food and drinks were fast. Again I've worked in way busier restaurants than this and I know host have to stop seating if the kitchen can't keep up but this was 100% not the case! This is the smallest Hard Rock I have ever been to so why they didn't seat anyone with a lot of open tables? The only thing I could think is they were hoping shift changes? The girl manager with short blonde hair should move to kitchen manager because you can be a bitch to your staff in the back of the house but being that way in the front and to customers should get you fired!! Again once we were sat we enjoyed our service but that doesn't do anything to make up for who you choose to have representing your company.   *** the GM retched out to me and it was nice to talk to him I hope this makes a difference for other customers and they are treated with respect.",

    "text": "12/1/2013 - My family and I stopped for an early Sunday dinner.  It wasn't busy because there weren't any games taking place and everyone else was out of town.  We were seated right away and there weren't any kids' menus.  The hostess went and made copies for my 2 youngest children and made sure that they had their crayons.    Our server introduced herself as MK.  She was very friendly.  We got our drinks and our server MK asked if we wanted an appetizer.  She suggested potato skins or the combo.  We ordered the Jumbo Combo.    My oldest son and husband decided on the 10 oz. burger, my daughter ordered a kids cheeseburger and I got one of my usual orders - Chicken Ceasar Salad.  MK noticed that my younger son was enjoying the wings and suggested he order the kids chicken with the Buffalo sauce.  He did.    My husband and son both liked their burgers,  my daughter ate most of her's (she is a picky eater), my son liked his chicken and my salad was as good as usual.  We gave MK our email address for the Hard Rock Cafe Rewards program.  We have been customers of the Hard Rock Cafe chain for at least 25 years.  We have visited HRC from Hawaii to Florida.   We preferred the other program where we would give the server our card and earn points that could be used to pay part of our bill.",

He was a hype man, goofy, and talkative. He checked on us every few minutes to see if we're okay.. What was different was that Luis got everyone attention to have the customers say 'Happy birthday' to my boyfriend. Funny and also cool.. Other than that, the food was good and we got seated instantly. I would definitely come here for 'fathers day' because I know my old man would love it here and hope to have Luis as our server again.",

You stroll across the street to a place called Hard Rock Cafe (sort of a brand icon for nearly 45 years; you may have heard of it...), only to be told at 11:45 on a Saturday night, \"We're actually closed now\" (customers within notwithstanding). Thank goodness for the Tilted Kilt Pub a block away, which was actually willing to feed and entertain us until 2:00 AM.  I'd only ever been to one HRC (Lahaina). After this debacle, I won't waste my time ever again.  Edited to say: 1) I appreciate the response from Business Manager Anthony S., and 2) the point was not so much that we were turned away 15 minutes before closing; rather that such an establishment closes 2 hours earlier than all the competition in the area, just as 15k+ potential customers are streaming out of a concert venue right across the street...",

I got the BBQ chicken combo and it tasted as if it was doused in salt. The only thing we honestly liked was the fries and drinks. When we talked to the manager he stated that there have been no complaints about this place ever but seeing some of the reviews here I'm guessing he doesn't care for his online reviews. The server was great but manager was completely rude and the food was bland. We're not all that picky (especially after all working in restaurants) but this was ridiculous.",

We had a rough start regarding seating but in the end it all worked out.  We found a bug in one of our cocktails but the manager comp-ed my friend's and my drink.  That is decent enough.  I got that \"small\" burger they have.  Meat was a step above over cooked.  Hubby got some kind of salad and he liked it.  My fries tasted like it was fried in really old oil.  The whole experience wasn't terrible but I can't justify giving it 3 stars.    Nice location though.",

One of my friends had to ask for the same thing more than once for her to get what she needed, but she was apologetic and nice about it.  Food: is pretty uniform among all hard rock cafes. I personally go to Hard Rock Cafe more for the atmosphere than the food. Not the best food in town and a bit \"fast-foody\". My only real complaint is the French fries were all soggy.",

A weak beer selection with the bar running out of the crafts? $14 burgers that don't look interesting? I guess it's cool to come here to say you've gone to one, but everyone I know says it's the worst they've been to in the US. I have nothing to compare it to just yet, but I should have listened.   Two stars because they have a groovy sound system and seem to support local artists. But I get that at a lot of places with good food/drink and no bums lurking outside the front door.",
