Not too much on the ribs.  I guess what got me, was the dirty dishes and glasses weren't taken. we had to ask. and I think they should know and if not the waiters should ask 'can I take this?'  We shared the brownie with 4 of us and it was to die for!!!",

They walk the line between fine dining and comfort food better than anyplace else I've been to.  Its really good -- but it's not great.  Take the BBQ brisket, for example.  The platter has thick slices of meet (about 1/4 inch thick!) which is just too thick for brisket -- it becomes chewy.  But the spicing, flavor, and thin layer of fat was perfect.  I enjoyed it despite wearing out my mandibles.  The blackened redfish was perfectly cooked but somewhat underspiced, at least by my standards which equates blackened with spicy.  The sides were all good but not great: beans-nothing special, grits-where were those jalapenos?, etc.  Best dish was the soup - a beef chili that had amazing flavor.  I ordered only a cup and wanted more.  Pricing is also between fine dining and comfort food.  I'm pretty sure you will enjoy your experience here, if you can get a reservation.",

We walked in and greeted by, I believe a manger, whom welcomed us in and told us the hostess, Jessica would be right with us. It was super friendly start to a great meal. Jessica was quick to meet us with a big smile and pleasantly quoted us around 15 minutes to get a table, which isn't too shabby for the noon lunch rush. My mother and I huddled around the hostess station because there was no where to sit and wait, except for several adirondack chairs outside. However, this wasn't an option for me because being the native Phoenician that I am, I cannot stand this current humidity and several other folk had the same plan. Instead we all either herded left or right to let people in and out of the entrance door.  We were seated in about 10 minutes, which could have been sooner, but we opted to sit inside instead of their cutely decorated patio complete with living walls. Three glass garage doors separated the patio from the inside eating area. In the center of the restaurant is a large bar with surrounding tables and about 4-5 booths on one side.  Marcus was our server who was also very pleasant and attentive. My mother and I both ordered iced teas ($3/ea) to drink which came with crushed iced, score! I ordered the salmon and small club salad ($17) and my mother ordered the carolina baby back ribs ($25). Because my mother ordered the ribs (you can't help but get messy), she requested a wet nap. Marcus showed up with a warmed wet fabric napkin folded inside a coffee cup, cute presentation as opposed to those paper packaged ones that require three or more before your hands are actually clean.   This was actually my second time here, I ordered to roti and ribs combo last time and enjoyed that just as much as I enjoyed this meal. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals and even though our lunch was expensive ($51.82 + tip), we both wouldn't hesitate to come back.   Big shout out again to Marcus for stellar service, he is one of the most brilliant servers I have ever had. When I decline dessert, my mother stated, \"that why she is skinny and cute and I am not\", and without any hesitation, Marcus responded, \"you're both skinny and cute\". Boom, tip increase, well played sir, well played!  We will be back!",

Portion was sizable though not overwhelming. Shrimps was grilled. Crisp on the outside and tender to bite into. The jalapeno grits were creamy with a spicy sausage sauce over all. Not overly salty either like we've had elsewhere. I had a white sangria that was light and refreshing. My miso glazed salmon came with a nice portion of grilled asparagus with fresh lemon half. The salmon was tender and a bit crispy, exactly how I like my salmon. Everything was nicely presented. Our in-training server did an excellent job in answering our questions and waiting on us. Go, you won't be disappointed.",

My wife and I both had excellent lobster bisque appetizer cups, and shared the BBQ brisket, with sides of grilled asparagus and show string fries.  All was excellent.  Brisket was a somewhat dense meat w/ a thick layer of fat along the short slices of meat, so if you want a lean meat, this would not be for you, but is was tasty!! Nice sweet BBQ sauce.  Loved the grilled, giant asparagus.  And a really nice craft beer menu, with several of my favorites, O'Dells 90 Shilling Irish Ale.  Definitely would come back.",

Offered helpful suggestions on what to choose.... I had the smoked brisket sandwich, it was so delicious , the Smokey flavor was not over powering, and the brisket melted in your mouth. With each bite you took you also Tate's the homemade cold slaw that topped the brisket , so delicious. Not to be forgotten was the Lobster Bisque soup, that I started with... so smooth and super delicious.... this is a very popular place, so if you are going for lunch get there early... They do take reservations so if time is an issue it might be wise to have a table waiting for you, especially if you want to eat outside on the patio. We arrived at 11:20a and all seating outside was taken and most tables were already reserved. You can't go wrong going here .... We came from Anthem and it was well worth the drive!!",

He did everything perfectly and he was so nice to talk to. We are definitely asking for him when we come back, which we definitely will be back!!! We were so glad there wasn't a wait and we were saying if this place was in NJ where we are from it would be at least an hour wait to sit down, and in NJ you judge how good a restaurant is by how many hours the wait is! The trout was sooooo delicious. I didn't leave one bite of food on my plate. Cocktails were spot on as well. I also didn't feel disgustingly stuffed full of heavy greasy fatty food which meant room for dessert. The banana split was delicious. I never get dessert so when I do, it better be worth it, and it was! I still didn't feel the gross kind of full I normally feel after dinner out which makes me so happy! I already have my server, meal and dessert picked out for our next visit (Austin, salmon, brownie). Can't wait. Thanks for such an awesome Friday night!!!!",

Especially enjoyed the ribs and brisket entrees and the jalapeno cheddar grits are different and delicious. The service has always been efficient even at busy times. MARINA was our server on last visit and was friendly and helpful with the menu. She checked on us frequently. Although the prices were somewhat high, which is typical of Scottsdale restaurants, we thoroughly enjoyed the entrees and sides. We will continue to visit Grassroots. It is a nice place to eat and  visit.",

Reason being for my review(and I've never 'yelped' before), my friends were treated awful there and not by just a server the manager/OWNER. I won't go into the details of the story; I will just sum it up.  Food was poorly prepared, brought to the attention of rude, incompetent server and then enter manager/OWNER. You'd think or hope he would be the one to save this situation but in fact he made it worse for my friends and him in the end because everyone we know will never give him our business or a second chance. He was rude, unwilling to fix or admit a situation, caused a situation that other patrons witnessed. Good luck",

However, I was asking for a baked potato. How can you be out of baked potatoes? That seems pretty standard. He then went on to say they are doing pretty well.....what??

We thought this menu looked great and decided to give it a whirl.  Ambiance was wonderful-lots of windows, light and a nice terrace in the back.  Our server was Sydney (sp?). We were torn over what sides to get so she brought us the greens on the House - they were awesome.    My friend got a salmon salad which she enjoyed, but I'm not much of a salmon fan.  My meal is the one that stole the show.  My friend and I agreed my meal was the best food we ate all weekend-Chicken salad sandwich and cole slaw.  I don't know which was better, the light, sweet, but hearty chicken salad on a crispy wheat bun, or the light-dressing cole slaw (not mayo based +++) They complimented each other perfectly.  That sandwich...WOW!  Service and food were fantastic, would come back here in a heart beat! I live above True Food in Chicago, and I wish I could kick them out and put a Grassroots in . Any hopes to expand???",

It was good but for the price, I know I could have eaten a way better pork chop. I think the pork chop was undercooked. As for the wait, considering I was just alone, it took them almost an hour for me to have a table after they initially just said 20 minutes wait time. I needed to follow up for my table which tells you that there is something wrong. I would probably try this again in the future to give it a chance but will try another dish.",

Both were delicious and had some great flavors.  I had the grilled portobello sandwich which was really tasty and a huge portion!  I could barely eat half.  And the cole slaw was really yummy as my side.  I had a Purple Haze beer to drink which was also great.    They were kid friendly (a huge plus for me) and ready with a highchair and some kids options.  Something I really appreciate for a bar/kitchen type of place.

Though our meal was served soon after ordering we felt Tyler was just rude as he circled our table several times without any acknowledgement.    Inefficient floor layout as servers have to circle the entire bar each trip to enter  oneway into the kitchen and out the other side for every thing they need. Way too many extra steps.

Wine on tap for five dollars a glass, 16 ounce beers for four dollars,  Bbq Beef brisket sliders on Kings Hawaiian rolls were very filling and a very good value, lots of beef and not too much sauce  As always the burrata with tomato jam and dressed arugula was a perfect combination of sweet, creamy and slightly bitter. Our only issue was that the toast was not crisp maybe they had made a whole bunch in advance and it sat around and the moisture from hot slices got some of the slices a little chewy.  We shared the brined pork chop with candied pancetta and sauteed Swiss chard with shredded Parmesan. All amazing and delicious. The pork chop was well brined and very juicy and tender.  We will return!  ---------------------New review 1/22/17  This week we returned for dinner and again sat at the bar because we did not have a reservation and it was very crowded.  My better half got the prime rib sandwich with shoestring fries and it was amazing. Tender roast beef, terrific toppings and crispy and well seasoned french fries. We do have to admit that the prime rib sliders during happy hour are a much, much better value. You get more meat, but with the entree sandwich you do get fries, although that may not be worth it!  My order was the shrimp and grits and I was very pleasantly surprised by how good it was. Eight good size shrimp after cooking, which were also well seasoned sitting on top of a flavorful and creamy white polenta with cheddar and jalapeno. Two really thick slices of tender and nicely grilled focaccia topped it off although I was a little concerned with how many carbs were on this dish. It made for a great leftovers in the toaster oven!  The wines and beers on tap during happy hour are a great deal.",

I met a friend here for dinner at 6pm. It was busy and we didn't have a reservation so our options were sitting on the heated patio, or sitting at a \"communal\" table inside. We opted for the shared table inside because even with the heaters, the patio was toooo cold! We sat at the end of the shared table and had no issues with the couple sitting next to us.   My friend and I ordered a meat and cheese board for $10 (HH price) that came with a giant loaf of fresh bread, mixed nuts, olives, and honey. Delicious! There were three types of cheese (brie, goat, and maybe munster) and three types of meat (salami, prosciutto, and...?). Everything was high quality and so flavorful! It was a lot of food for the two of us, so we were pretty full by the time we ordered our entree. We decided to split a plate, which was the right decision.  We went with the waitress' recommendation and ordered the short ribs with cheesy jalapeno grits. OMG. Amazing!!! Best short rib I've ever had, ever! As I said, it has been a long time since I've had such a tasty meal! The short rib was plenty of food to split between two, and between the entree and the appetizer, we were stuffed! My one and only complaint is that the short rib came with TWO pieces of asparagus. TWO!? That's it?! I need some veggies, c'mon guys!   5 stars for the food, 5 stars for the ambiance, 3 stars for a pathetic portion of asparagus. I'LL BE BACK SOON!",

There were a lot of dating couples there, siting together and looking out from the booths at everyone else. It was people-watching paradise! But more importantly, their food was super. We started with the chopped salad, had so much in it hard to remember it all. Beets, squash, cabbage, veggies galore... crazy good. The pub board item \"My Fathers Grocery Bag\" or some such,  was great. Assorted cheeses and olives, nuts. My friend got a fish sandwich, which she liked but I did not try. We saw so many things we wanted to try that we promised we would stop here next time we drive by and try something else on the menu. The bartender was great, on top of things and very friendly.",

    "text": "From our recent visit and note to their Founder:  We live in North Phoenix and began trading in your area a few months ago.  This was due, in part, to our plan for relocating my aging Father (from south Florida)  to Scottsdale.  Found him a great little place @Tuscany in McCormick Ranch.  My wife and I have had lunch 4-5 times at Grassroots Scottsdale the 2-3 months and now that my Dad is here, 3 more times.  Called last monday am and Shawn took my call as we wanted to reserve a booth.  He said he would request it and with our early arrival it should not be an issue as this was the first night of MNF.  He was mistaken on one front as the place was quite busy yet we did get the booth.  Dmitri was our server and like most of the talent here, he was over the top gracious, humorous and attentive.  First time to try your crab dip-utterly sensational and enhanced by his description of the preparation.   We collectively enjoyed the Ahi Tuna Sandwich, the salmon, the cardiff salad and another dish I cannot recall.  Even had that crazy brownie to share.  Not sure we have had  dining experiences (almost 10's) in a short period of time whereby we did not fatigue or get dis-enchanted by the inconsistency of prepping a dish from one night to another.  Grassroots is so over the top with the faire and cuisine presentation.  It is incredulous in a good way Christopher.  Yet in the end , it is always about the people and a fact that your Team truly operates in rarified air on this note.  And this is a supreme credit to you and your GM who finds and keeps this talent.  BTW, your Manager that night, a young woman (30 something) was very visible and interactive.",

Having worked in restaurants and now in the hospitality industry, this is inexcusable. The quality of the staff undermines what could be a good restaurant. When will people learn what working in the hospitality industry means.   Unfortunately this took a nice date night to a poor experience due to lack of preparation, detail and training.

We have had almost everything on the menu, and it has always been good. Our kids love it, and we always take out-of-town visitors here as well. It  is a favorite.

I went with the Blackened Fish Sandwich, the fish they offer differs between a few and is red fish sometimes but on my day it was Maui Maui. My side I picked was fresh green beans with olive tapanade and feta cheese. Everything on plate was delicious, the fish was prepared perfect on an above average artisan bun with a tasty slightly spicy sauce and some toppings and I thought my side was above average too it was also prepared perfect and seasoned very nicely.  My husband went with the shrimp po boy. He said it was also delicious and prepared perfect but could have used a little more shrimp. He couldn't decide on one side so he picked two and had to have the dirty orzo and the jalapeno cheese grits. He said they were awesome and we have to come back to here again.  I was full but we wanted to try dessert and went with the house made apple pie because it was a special offering that they don't have all the time. They bring out a large slice that is plenty for two people dressed with caramel and vanilla gelato. I liked that the pie had a super thin crust and the apples were cooked well and nicely seasoned but for my taste the crust was a little doughy but it still was good.  Service was fantastic!  A very solid four stars!",

They have great happy hour food and drinks from 3-6pm. During happy hour, signature cocktails are $6 and some appetizers are discounted.   For drinks, we both ordered their signature margarita. Let's just say it was a lot of margarita. For appetizers, we ordered Dad's Grocery Bag which came with a loaf of French bread, three cheeses, three cured meats, nuts and local honey for $10. We also ordered the \"boat load of wings\" which is 1.5 pounds of chicken wings/drumsticks for $5 - a great deal! For our entree, we split Topher's Braised Short Ribs which comes with asparagus and jalapeno grits. The Grocery bag was delicious - especially the meats and cheeses. The bread was a little on the hard side and I was expecting olives, but not a big deal. The wings were delicious with a sweet BBQ sauce. Definitely a lot of food, but we managed to polish them off. The short ribs were really good - both juicy and tender. The jalapeno grits were good, nice and spicy from the jalapeno, but grits aren't my favorite. We wished we had room for dessert because the key lime pie sounded yummy.    We loved Grassroots so much that we came back for lunch. We came around 1pm on a Friday and it wasn't very busy. They were able to sit us right away and our waitress was quick to take our orders. For a starter, we ordered the pork belly which comes with spicy tomato jam, candied pancetta, and toast points. My husband LOVES pork belly and orders it no matter where we are. This pork belly was delicious, but a little on the dry side. I loved the pancetta, but they aren't really \"candied\" so much as drenched in maple syrup. It's cool since it was still delicious. For my entree, I ordered the smoked brisket sandwich with dirty orzo. Oh my goodness. I am in love with this sandwich. The brisket melted in my mouth. I am craving it just writing this review! The dirty orzo was also delicious which a myriad of flavors. (Also makes a great snack the next day.) My husband ordered the shrimp po'boy with shoestring potatoes. The po'boy was on a French baguette and while delicious, I found it difficult to take a bite when I sampled it. My husband loved it and enjoyed the shrimp greatly. I can't wait to come back for lunch and get the brisket sandwich again.  Our third visit was for dinner on a Wednesday evening. Soup of the day for Wednesday is Grassroots Gumbo so we ordered a bowl to split. We also ordered the pork belly appetizer and decided to split the short ribs, which was a good idea because everything was so delicious and filling. The Gumbo was amazing with super tender chicken and spicy sausage. I want to come back every night for this Gumbo, that's how good it was!   Overall, I would highly recommend Grassroots. Definitely come check it out. Whether it's lunch or dinner, you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "If you can get past the bitchy receptionist, the food is fairly decent. Let me preface my statement; we met a couple of friends here for an early dinner on a Sunday late afternoon with our 5 month old. The receptionist tried to insist that we sit in a booth that logistically would not have worked with the baby carrier and comfortably facilitate four adults. If you have kids, you understand what I'm talking about. I nearly got into an argument with the TWIT that we needed the extra space for comfort and basically had to just walk over to one of their crescent booth tables and plop our stuff down. A place of this caliber really should make better strides at hiring staff that possess a little common sense. Moving on.... the food is great, the atmosphere is nice. Our waitress was pleasant, she didn't go out of her way to make us feel overly comfortable or welcomed. I think next time we decide to go out we'll think of another location merely because of the sub par overall service we received. Don't these people realize that the consumer ALWAYS wins...?",

    "text": "A friend and I decided to try Grassroots on 4/20/12. We arrived about 5:45 and got 2 stools at the bar. The bartender came over and gave us a menu and took our drink order a couple minutes later. After about 10 minutes I noticed that it was getting hot in the restaurant - the patron next to me said she heard the A/C was broken. One of the 3 female bartenders confirmed that the A/C was only working in a small portion of the restaurant.   We decided to brave the heat and ordered the shrimp po boy and the grilled fish with fries and Asian coleslaw as the sides so that we could split them and try both items. The food was fabulous - the service was another story. First of all, I like when the server introduces themselves to the customer - not one of the three ladies did this. My friend and I observed them and they were very unengaged with the customers - maybe it was the heat - maybe it was the less than flattering uniforms they were wearing. You could tell they weren't happy - not too many smiles.  I will try the restaurant again but I wouldn't choose to sit at the bar. I think that whomever was in charge that night should have done something as a gesture of goodwill due to the hot conditions in the restaurant. I'm not saying the meal should have been comped but maybe a drink or dessert and a percentage off the bill would have made the customer want to try it again.",

    "text": "I've finally decided to review this great little restaurant since I've been here 5 or more times.  I was first dragged here several months ago by my father who lives close to there, for lunch.  This place is owned by the same people who own Wally's, and he is a Wally's fan while I am not, and so I wasn't thrilled about the prospect.  I was glad to be proven wrong.  I have to admit, I have had only one thing on the menu: the seasonal vegetable chop salad.  It's seriously one of my favorite things in life and I eat A LOT OF SALADS.  There are so many different ingredients that somehow don't compete with eachother but rather delicately blend together and yet all stand out as delicious little pops of flavor in every bite.  I have seen dining partners order various things from the menu and have never seen anyone disappointed.  Sweet Pea loved the hamburger, and he's a real hamburger aficionado, often proclaiming them \"too charbroil-y\" or other made up adjectives that I don't quite understand.  The jalapeno cheddar grits that he got as a side were out of this world- just enough of both the pepper and the cheese flavors without being overwhelming.  I think my exact comment on them was \"I'd like to dive headfirst into a vat of these and eat my way out.\"  The service is always top notch.  Go, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "When you bring clients here twice in one week, you know it's a winner! Grassroots boasts a simply incredible menu, mouth watering side dishes, and an upscale yet casual environment for dining to impress or relax.   The key stand-outs were the Root's BBQ Brisket and the Carolina Baby Backs. Both had savory sauces and fall-off-the-bone, tender meat. It's the kind of bbq that silences a table and all you hear are the occasional groans of enjoyment. Food envy will be rampant, though it's difficult to choose a bad dish. For sides, I also recommend the Jalapeno Cheddar Grits, a Pork Belly Baked Beans. The flavors really pop.   For the vegetarians and vegans, don't fret. Grassroots offers dishes that are veggie-only and convertible vegan.   There's a fine selection of wine and craft beer featuring some local brews from San Tan and Four Peaks. They even have Purple Haze, which is a fun one from Louisiana.   On each of my visits, we sat on the patio, because, why not sit on the patio? With a slight chill in the air, the patio is covered, and there are heaters available to keep you toasty. The servers were knowledgable and friendly.   Overall, I really like Grassroots, and I've never been disappointed by a visit.",

They have quite a few options and even offer a gluten free bun.  I got the brisket and jalapeno grits with baked beans.  The waitress said the grits weren't spicy and she was right which was good because I don't like spicy food.  The grits were delicious! The brisket was good, but a bit dry.

All the way down to the Diet Coke and the soft and crunchy little ice pellets.   Everything was amazing. Everything was genuinely perfect.   The service, the menu options, our food, portion sizes, atmosphere, wait staff,  etc etc.  I'll follow up tomorrow, but I'll leave this for now just In case someone checks in on YELP to see what the reviews are on this place before I have the chance to write a solid review. I hope this little tidbit of a review will suffice in the meantime!     PS:  The Heath bar and caramel brownie was also scrumptious!",

Maybe it's because the bartenders have a special way of dealing with folks but you also learn so much about the establishment.    As for the food, we ordered a relatively new menu item called sea smoke salad - salmon with orzo, arugula, cherry tomatoes, cucumber and a bunch of other heavenly things.  It was light yet satisfying! We also ordered the shrimp po'boy and in lieu of fries, we opted for the jalapeno cheddar grits---yummm!   I wish we lived closer so we can try the rest of all this good stuff! Stop by...you won't be sorry!",

Then our waitress showed up once to take our order and once to deliver our food.  She reached across everyone's face to deliver food instead of going around the table - not even an excuse my reach. We had to flag her down to get my husband a refill and she never once refilled my ice tea.  Then when she cleared the table again she reached across my face while I was chewing my food to grab my husband's plate. It was a Thursday and not busy at all.",

Make reservations; we didn't (we're from Tucson and were visiting Scottsdale, and walked-in around 5p) and had to wait a little over 30 minutes after initially being told a two-top would free up in little more than 20 minutes. Apparently the host-staff forgot about us, until my wife went back up to inquire, and was met with repeated profuse apologies (which were actually unanticipated - we took them as admissions of guilt, as the hostess could have told us the 3-4 other couples who were seated before us had reservations; we probably would have believed that - but it wasn't the case), and only then were we promptly seated....  Professional service with a smile from our waiter, Tara, mostly made up for the rocky start - as did most of the food. Caesar salad (with anchovies added) was on point. My Shrimp Po'Boy and slaw were amazing. Don't waste your time or money with the meat & cheese board or the trout - both are super basic, underwhelming, and overpriced. That said, the salad and my sandwich - again - were so excellent that I'll likely be back for them. Come to think of it, as we were looking around at what others were eating and enjoying, it seemed to be mostly stuff from the salad and sandwich sections of the menu, in particular.",

She said I can seat you outside but we need that table back by 6:40, or I can seat you inside but I need that table back by 6:20. I said, \"You need The Table back?\" Seriously?  I have never heard anything like that in my life. Rude beyond words. Either you have room, or you don't. You don't tell the customer how long they can stay. I was appalled.",

Seth, Megan and Sara were working the bar area, I mean wurking it....Yezzzz honey. They were awesome!   Ok on to the food. We started with the cheese and meat platter(I forgot the name) which was yum. Entree I did a burger with baked beans (which were amaze balls )and my friend had the lobster bisque (prefers hers thicker but said it was really good) and the Hawaiian bread BBQ chicken sliders. We both thoroughly enjoyed every bite (damn that was a lot of food folks). Seth made us a couple of mean white sangrias, I was speaking fluent Spanish after that one. We begrudgingly forced ourselves to order the house made brownie with vanilla ice cream for dessert and it was yummm. We only made it through about 3 bites each and then we threw in the towel.

I've now been to Grassroots on several occasions. The first time was for lunch with Lindsey D, and that was followed by two dinners with family.  In those meals alone, I dined with a pregnant woman (Lindsey), a plain Jane (think no sauces, no oil, etc...), a vegetarian, a Cross Fit coach (my bro) that eats mostly Paleo, a big meat and potato type (my dad), a moderately healthy eater (me), and a couple of in betweeners.  I've either seen or tried firsthand the following menu items: -the chopped vegetable salad (with and without protein added) -the broiled rainbow trout -the roasted chicken walnut salad sandwich -the smoked brisket sandwich -the short ribs -the shrimp and grits -the shoe string potatoes -the grilled asparagus  and probably a few more!  It's all been satisfying; maybe not the best meal in the world, but consistent and nothing has been sent back...  Service has been attentive and drinks (wine and cocktails) are approved as well...  They've got both indoor and outdoor seating and a convenient location off of Hayden and Via de Ventura.  They also have a second location in the Biltmore area that I wouldn't hesitate to check out!",

We came on a weekend, so the place was pretty busy but we had a reservation so there was no wait time.

I really liked how they gave us mason jars of water - I'm a sucker for drinking out of jars! Food: For appetizers, we got the burrata and the tuna poke. The burrata was great and the tomato jam that accompanied it was very good, although it was a bit sweet and did overpower the cheese a little bit. The poke was also good and well seasoned, but a little too sweet for my tastes. They also should've served more wonton crisps with it! For the entree, I got the shrimp and grits, which was excellent! I wish I hadn't eaten so much of the appetizers though because the portion was huge! There is a decent amount of shrimp, not too much, but the grits portion was huge and came with not one, but two pieces of focaccia. Talk about carbs on carbs! My family had the braised beef, the short ribs, and the pork belly. The braised beef and the short ribs were very similar in taste, but both were excellent! I found myself wishing I had ordered one of them instead of the shrimp. My brother said the pork belly was awesome, so I'll take his word for it! We didn't have any room for dessert, so I can't offer any advice on that! Overall, it was a good experience, especially if you like Southern cuisine!",

The Burrata is to die for, as are the shortribs with jalapeno cheddar grits.  Seriously, everything is so great here and we've never had a bad meal.  For drinks, I highly recommend the white Sangria!  For dessert top it all off with a toffee brownie... or go next door to their ice cream/candy shop for something sweet!",

It started by having to ask 5x to 3 different servers for one bud light. And when we finally got the server to listen; we asked for 3 and he brought us 2. Then after that, we didn't get served our entree until everyone in our party was done eating and the manager had to get involved. When we finally got our meal, the short rib was dry... such a bummer. We had to wait another lifetime for our dessert and checks. And to top it off, half of our checks were charged incorrectly. They tried to rectify the situation by giving us $12 off. It definitely did not make up for the terrible experience my boyfriend and I had. Don't think we'll be back to this location again.",

We picked the coldest night of the year to sit outside on the patio and although it was chilly due to the wind it wasn't that bad with the heaters going and we had a good time. The other option was a 25 minute wait for an inside table. I had the spit fire chicken which was delicious....the soaked bread and baked potato were tasty and comforting....the servings were more than generous and I couldn't eat it all. My husband had the ribs and a bowl of soup and our son had the grilled cheese. In his words the shoestring fries were amazing. We also decided to have dessert. I had the key lime pie, my husband had the pecan pie and our son had a huge root beer float. Everything was yummy but we couldn't finish them.  Prices are fair....our meal came to $72 before tip, the service was decent. The food came out quickly but we had to wait a bit for service in between such as refills and the check.

Our waiter said, \"Let me bring a plate out for you.\"  This is the last day of our trip now and when we asked his favorite meal he said, \"It was the sample plate of the orzo that was the best.\"    I had the Ahi tuna salad, wife had the portobello burger, daughter had the brisket and son had the steak sandwich.  All were great choices that we passed around.    Highly recommend these items and more.  You can't go wrong with this location.",

We took a group of business partners to lunch and all had never been. They loved each meal they got as well. Shrimp and grits was another big win. The salmon and asparagus was flavored just perfect and the sandwiches were exactly what you need out of a lunch portion.   The service was attentive and polite. I drink water like a crazy person so whenever I go out to eat it's basically a running joke to see if anyone can keep my water glass full.....they managed to get out of this meal with a big win with a full water glass the whole time!  Yaayyyy for amazing servers.",

The rainbow trout tasted off, like not fresh, nor good so we returned it.  The sauteed chard that came with it was very good.  The red beans and rice and romaine salad were good, I am told.  I did not try it myself.  After returning the trout, we ordered the roots bbq smoked brisket.  This was very good.  The smoked brisket was very soft and moist.  The pork belly bbq beans that came with it were awesome!! tastes like homemade.  Even the beans tasted fresh and not canned.  The cheddar grits were very good as well.  Cooked to perfection.  Service was very good.  Just remember don't order fish on a Monday anywhere.  lol.  It's forgivable since everything else was fantastic.  We both talked about coming back again.  We took the key lime pie to go.  It was heavenly.  Tasted homemade.  Update: Came back on a Wednesday and ordered the blackened redfish and gumbo.  Gumbo had a good taste 3.5 stars.  The blackened redfish was super yummy!! about as good as you are going to get it in Arizona.  5-stars.  the rice pilaf that came with it was 1.5 stars.",

We ordered the piggly wiggly [$9] and the wings [$5] from the happy hour menu. We also ordered a side of shoestring fries.  The wings came out and they were nice and small and crispy pieces. I would order these again, esp for the price and utaste. The piggly wiggly came out and it was a half size set of ribs, two pieces of pork belly, four pieces of toasted bread w/ homemade jam, and two bacon wrapped asparagus. The pork belly melted in your mouth.  I would definitely come back again! The total for the three dishes was $20. The service was great and at that time, it was quite nice since it wasn't packed.  At the end of the meal, we received two coupons for two free scoops of ice cream at Sweet Provisions. When we went next door to claim our free desserts, we were able to use the ice cream coupon for a bar.",

For 20 months, my husband dreamed of the Cajun Seared Ahi Sandwich and couldn't wait for us to return to this restaurant! We made reservations for his birthday and could not have been more pleased.  Our server Jack was amazingly attentive and very personable. My hubby got his sandwich and fries; and I got the Spit Fire Roasted Chicken, also with fries. Their shoestring fries are TO DIE FOR!!! The chicken is delicious and seasoned to perfection (I suggest a separate plate for the fries or they get all soggy and full of gravy). For dessert, we got the Toffee Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream, which was truly decadent, and lasted me about 3 days!!  We've been back another time in the last week at a busier time of day -- server was still nice and attentive but definitely stretched thinner with more tables to cover. I'd suggest a reservation, especially if you'd like to eat outside (there are heaters outside!). We'll definitely be back at least a few more times before we leave!!",

    "text": "My girlfriend flew in from Thousand Oaks, CA to spend the day with me and my hubby and I wanted to take her to a special lunch. We got here about 1 PM for a late lunch and it was perfect timing as the lunch crowd was already leaving and there were only about 3 other tables being served. We were all hungry and didn't know what to expect.  We were not prepared for the culinary heaven we were about to experience.  OMG. OMG. OMG.  We started with an appetizer called Dad\"s Grocery Bag which was served on a cutting board and had a ciabatta loaf, artisan cheeses, cured meats,  country olives and mixed nuts. The bread was warm, the cheese rich and meats robust. We pretty much inhaled this appetizer and were ready for what we really came for and that was for the Carolina Baby Back ribs.   Two of us ordered ribs and my hubby ordered the Tri Tip Sandwich. The ribs came two different ways I ordered the full rack of ribs that came with the shoestring fries, my friend, the half of rack of ribs with the roasted chicken, asparagus and coleslaw. Let me first start with the  Try Tip Sandwich. Once my hubby saw our orders, it was game over. While he enjoyed his sandwich, he said it was an 8/10 he was agreed that these ribs were one of the best ribs we've come across.   Like I said, GAME OVER, these ribs fell off the bone every so slightly without any effort. The ribs also had the BBQ sauce spread out evenly and nicely (not too heavy, not too light) and had just the delicate balance of spices and sweetness. The portions were huge, I felt guilty having a whole rack of ribs in front of me, after 2 bites, I so didn't want to share these ribs with anyone. Not even my beautiful husband. But sadly, he talked his way into eating half of my rack. Now folks these ribs were so good, that we decided to just forgo our manners and not try to use our forks and knives to get the meat off. After the 3rd rib, we just started picking them up and yes, we used our hands at a white table restaurant. After all, there were hardly any people there.  I enjoyed each and every rib and savored the experience. All three of us agreed that this was the most perfectly cooked rack of ribs we've ever tasted. As far as the shoestring fries and coleslaw, the fries were lightly salted, nicely cooked and tender. The coleslaw was just right, not too mayo tasting and looked like a really healthy salad.  But we weren't done...  When we found out that the key lime pie and the brownie were homemade, we had no choice but to order it. Why not right? We already polished off 1.5 rack of ribs, beautiful bread, artisan cheeses and prosciutto.   The key lime pie was perfect. Not too sweet, not to tart and the crust and filling melted in your mouth. The brownie was excellent, moist and not too sweet. The portions of both the desserts were for sharing, which means between the three of us we only ate half of each portion.  All in all service was great, friendly and attentive. So with the specialty ice teas, 1 appetizer, 3 lunch entrees and 2 desserts, the lunch was about $140 with tip. Not too bad for a piece of heaven.  And if you're wondering if we'll be returning here the answer is YES. YES. YES.  After four months living in Phoenix, this is one of the best restaurants I've been to and I can't wait to return.",

Short note, I ended up making love to my perfectly chosen meal thanks to no other than Jacob. At the near end of my meal however, rain starting pouring in buckets. I was fearful for my food and more importantly myself. Guess what though? Jacob. Jacob raced from his station, dropping his apron, and lifted me into his arms, carrying me powerfully, but carefully inside. Jacob is the best.

Because it was packed recently, we braved the patio in the summer with the misters, and it was pleasantly comfortable (as long as you don't mind a little wetness). By far, one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants.",

The welcome service when we first arrived was excellent - very pleasant.  We received our water and menus very quickly.  After that - in spite of the fact that it was early and the restaurant and bar were not at all crowded - the service was very poor. Even though we were seated (per our request) on the outside terrace, the tables should have been clean.  They were not.  Many many wonderful restaurants in the Scottsdale area to choose from.  We most certainly will NOT return to Grassroots and encourage others to look elsewhere for a pleasant dining experience.  There are many to be had!",

Three of us had the Scottish Salmon with a small side of the signature jalapeno grits; the other diner chose the short ribs. We were all very happy and well fed but had to try the Key Lime pie- similarly excellent. Everyone who served our table was friendly and professional.

I like to go on Friday's in particular because they have their special Omega 3 Salmon burger that day.  Fresh salmon with arugula, avocado and aoili on a flax-seed bun with your choice of side (if they have the grilled broccoli that day it is a must order) - a super yummy lunch without the heavy guilt!  Service is also impeccable and I've yet to have a server that I didn't enjoy.  I will say though, I do get extra excited when I get to sit in Sarah's section; she's very knowledgeable about the food, incredibly upbeat, and has a great sense of humor :)  If you get a chance to sit in her section you won't be disappointed.

    "text": "We went in just for some take out food while visiting in Scottsdale, and while we enjoyed the food we ordered, their takeout system is extremely confusing. Everyone we spoke to was very nice, but we were told to basically wait next to the end of the bar in the entryway where servers were walking in and out of the kitchen and try to get the bartender's attention to place an order.   The food took a while to get done, we both ordered almost the same item, a salad and a salad sandwich, and it took way longer than expected to finish. Meanwhile, we weren't really sure if it was finished already and the bartender who was serving customers hadn't noticed yet and we were trying to stay out of the workers' way to make sure they could get around while staying in eyesight.  The food was great, and it looked like a really cool restaurant-I do just wish they had a more efficient way to do takeout orders.",

The food is relatively good for the most part and I've enjoyed several dishes here with one of my favorite being their salads. The Garlic Ceaser dressing is to die for and the portion sizes are adequate. The chocolate brownie dessert (when fresh) has got to be one of my all time favorites anywhere. The quality of service does vary however, based on how busy they are at any given time.  If you're looking for a healthy meal or happy hour and desert in the Scottsdale Ranch area this place is a must try!",

    "text": "Let me just tell you... this place is FANTASTIC. My husband and I brought his parents here on Saturday night to celebrate my father-in-law's birthday. I made a reservation for 6:45 thinking there'd be a huge wait at that time but they seemed to be busy without being completely full, which was nice. We were seated out on the patio which was lovely until I later realized the mosquitoes had their own dinner plans and my leg was the main course.  ANYWAY.  I'd like to shout out to our server Sarah B. for being the best. And I'm not just saying the best like, \"yeah she was cool,\" but she really was THE BEST. My FIL joked before dinner that he had a \"dietary restriction\" that he just HAD to have key lime pie for dessert. She said she was sure she could make that happen, then after we finished our meals, told us that for the first time in her 4 years working there, they were ALMOST out of key lime pie... she threatened everyone else that if they touched the last piece of key lime pie they'd be in trouble. So she went to great lengths to make my FIL happy!  Enough yammering. Onto dinner!  - Pork Belly appetizer: with pancetta (because what more could you want with pork than more pork?) and a sweet and spicy tomato jam. YUM. - Miso Glazed Tuna: this was mine and I ate the ENTIRE thing, including the slaw and heirloom tomato salad (sub goat cheese for bleu because bleu and tomatoes do not go together in my world). I could bathe in that slaw.  - Salmon and a cobb salad: my husband's. He loved it. Salmon was cooked perfectly but he said the cobb stole the show. - Blackened Swordfish: MIL got the special and lerrrved it. - Hoisin Glazed Short Ribs: holy. motherfracking MOLY guys. FIL got this with asparagus and mashed potatoes. I was in love with my meal but this was just ridonkulously good. Almost wanted to send mine back just to have his. - Bottle o' Wine: Russian River pinot noir. I know... I go to Arizona just to drink California wine, but whatever, it's in my blood.  We also had coffee and a toffee brownie sundae for dessert and it was all just as good as the rest. So SO sooooo yummy. Damn. I'm hungry again.",

I also would not come here with vegetarians since they don't have many options (there was one mushroom sandwich, and one hot entree consisting of veggies and cheese). On the other hand, the meat eaters were pretty happy. We tried the pork belly appetizer, poke, prosciutto wrapped asparagus, redfish, salmon, short ribs, and seared ahi salad.   As for service, the servers were friendly but we had to really try to catch the attention of the server a few times to order, get drinks, and then the check. The one thing that brought our experience down though was the bug in one of the drinks. While the staff were understanding in taking it off the bill, it was an unpleasant surprise and really made us question the rest of our meals, unfortunately.",

It came with beautifully toasted Italian bread.  Although simple my dinner was wonderful.  Farmer's Vegetable Chop Salad with a perfectly grilled Salmon.  The salad came with green cabbage, red beets, grapes, butternut squash,  corn, radishes, cherry tomatoes, scallions, cucumber, edamame, feta cheese, basil, parsley and champagne vinaigrette.  We also ordered grilled asparagus, Cole Slaw, and French Fries.    The food was both simple with its perfection.  The waitress, the price and the manager made certain of that.",

Their short-ribs are some of the best I've ever had. I've had a chance to sit at the bar (which is huge and great) and have drinks. It's a great way to have drinks with your friends.",

The menu is simple but offers a lot of good options. Service is as friendly as it can be and service is very good. I ordered the salmon with asparagus, it is organic and it was cooked to perfection, melted in my mouth. the asparagus were the big thick ones and also were cooked to perfection, crunchy but soft. My customers ordered a salad, not sure which but looked amazing and plentiful and the Tuna sandwich and also looked amazing. I also tried the lemonade, is it freshly made with real lemons, also fantastic. I will definitely will be back, I have to try so many other option on the menu!! This will definitely become a favorite of mine.",

We've enjoyed \"Dad's grocery bag\" (the cheese/meat platter), the smoked salmon is perfection, the ribs fall off the bone, the short rib is decadent.  I loved my grapefruit martini.    There are 2 must trys!  1- the loaded baked potato (after 5 only) and 2- the simple and delicious banana split with yummy sugared nuts.  We almost always share one.    Overall I really hope this little brew/wine house continues its success because it is seriously yummy and a great addition to our neighborhood eats.",

I ordered a white sangria- asked them to make it a little less sweet than normal and they made it perfect. We ordered the cheese plate and it was good- Brie, goat cheese, and Parmesan. I wish they had put more unique cheeses, but they were good. For entree, we ordered the baby back ribs. OMG they were so good. The meat fell off the bones, there wasn't too much fat, and the sauce was spicy and unique. The fries were also good- totally fresh. We were too full to try anything else. I'd def come back- those ribs are one of the best I've ever had",

We got a pitcher of MBC's Celis White (I was so excited to see Michigan beer on the menu!), and I ordered the Waldorf salad. We had awesome service, enjoyed the atmosphere, and I was treated with a flower at the end of my meal.  Having lived in Scottsdale only a year, and there being so many different places to eat, there aren't many restaurants we've visited more than once. We've been back to Grassroots twice more in the last few months, and I wish we could take it with us when we move! We've never had to wait more than a couple minutes for a table (even on a Friday night), there are plenty of lower cost options on the menu, a great beer selection, and great service. The food is obviously delicious as well. I thoroughly enjoyed each dish I've had, including the cajun-spiced ahi tune sandwich and fries, and the roasted walnut chicken sandwich and jalapeno cheddar grits. All in all, it's a great place for some really good food, beer and atmosphere. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone!",

I ordered the rainbow trout with kale. Both were cooked perfectly and just delicious. My dad had the beef brisket and really enjoyed it and my stepmom had a romaine salad with the soup of the day. We also shared a few desserts, the brownie a la mode and the key lime pie and both were simply amazing! The only not so great part of this lunch was our server. He wasn't attentive at all and we had to ask for drink refills twice (our drinks were completely empty) which is pretty uncommon at good restaurants. He seemed like he didn't want to be there and with his lack of friendliness and attentiveness it just kind of put a damper on our lunch. Food is a 4.5, service was a 2 so I give this a 3 star for now. I'll be back and just hope he isn't serving next time!",

    "text": "Scottsdale eats earlier than Denver does.  Back home, you could wander into any restaurant at 5:15 and sit right down.  Here, we were told we'd have a 20 minute wait, which turned out to be closer to 40 minutes.  Aside from being a bit irritating (though we understand what a guessing game \"wait time\" can be for the staff), we were also in a rush by the time we actually sat down because we had an event starting at 6:40.  The hostess came by a couple of times to assure us that we were getting closer, and eventually we were sat.  We didn't explicitly tell our poor waiter that we were now in a big hurry, but our demeanor must have given us away.  He was efficient and fast, bringing us our food very shortly after we ordered, and bringing the bill to and from the table quickly.  We made it on time, and he made it look easy.  Kudos.  The food was solidly above average.  I had a hankerin' for some of the southern food my grandma used to make, so I had the BBQ brisket with baked beans and grits.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  The brisket fell apart, the baked beans were hot and tasty, and the grits were creamy and delicious.  The BBQ sauce wasn't anything to write home about, but that's secondary to the meat being cooked properly, which it was.  Tanya had a salad, and it was a solid salad.  I believe it was the Waldorf.  It had a good amount of things that weren't just lettuce.  I would like to come back again and be less rushed to really enjoy the ambiance, which is warm, open, and inviting.  The good food and great service warrant a return trip.",

Altogether a great place to go without breaking the bank.  The only impediment to giving a five-star review is that the lighting on the outdoor terrace is far too bright - like the Spanish Inquisition.  We were told that there is no way to dim those lights.  Fortunately we were able to move to a booth inside, where we were expertly served by Colby.  I especially liked my Red Fish dish.  The burrata starter was also excellent.",

We both had the shoestrings that were obviously fresh made. I really loved the setting and could see it being a great happy hour and dinner date restaurant.",

Stopped in on a Tuesday with the Husband and kids (13 & 8 - both kids are super adventurous eaters so I had no worries). It was busy, but they got us in on a high top in the bar. I know I'm going to love a place when the menu starts to blur because every single thing looks amazing!   We started with the Pork Belly (my husbands favorite food on the planet). Pork Belly with candied prosciutto.  It was probably one of the best things I have ever eaten. Could have stopped there and been perfectly happy....but why??  We ordered short ribs (husband), shrimp and grits (me), seared ahi (Big), and chicken with hearts of romaine (Little). All of them were absolutely spectacular. The short ribs were melty and delicious and fabulous. The BBQ sauce was heavenly and the meat was ridiculously tender. The shrimp and grits were nothing short of amazing. I could have just done the bowl of jalapeno cheese grits on its own without the shrimp...  The Ahi was Devine. The agave ponzu was sweet and delicious and I'd like a bottle of it to use at home... Or to drink, whichever.... The hearts of romaine was yummy and Little cleaned her plate.   We finished off the meal (already stuffed...) with a banana split that was creamy gelato topped with candied pecans. Just yummy and wonderful. Can't wait to get back to Scottsdale to enjoy this place again. Just a GREAT, GREAT meal!!",

It was a busy Friday night, but we had reservations and it was my birthday, and knowing this our server still wasn't the nicest but I didn't let it ruin my day. The food was amazing and that's why we came.   You've probably read this in 10 other reviews, but start with the burrata cheese appetizer. Holy cow. It's my new favorite way to eat bruschetta. It is sort of like a deconstructed version but insanely flavorful and good with the fresh cheese and spiced tomato jam (see picture)  We ordered the burger of course, with baked beans. And the short rib with cheddar jalapeno grits!!!!!!!! GRITS!!!!!! Haha I love grits. I also love that the menu had classic items with a southern flair. There were so many entrees I wanted to try so I'll definitely be back.  The place has such a cool vibe. Perfect for a date night or girls night out. We got to sit on the patio which I loved it had cute lights and cute wood booths and fires going. Super cool ambiance. Romantic.   All in all I'd be back, but you're paying good money for good food so good service is EXPECTED. :)",

I could eat a pound of just their ahi mix all by itself, Its that delicious. Its the salty, citrusy but, a hint of sweetness mixed together Its ono! Lol  Customer service has always been nice, the host/hostess are very pleasant and the people Ive met so far are very helpful and always smiling!  I recently came here with my girlfriends celebrating a special event for us three and this was my first time I sat outside. Such a nice umbiance, not too loud and enough for us to hear each others conversation across the table...   The food was all delicious - the pork belly pupus and I had the filet mignon (im not a big eater but, hungry for meat) and it was cooked to perfection.   Our waiter was great in dealing with us and being patient as well!   I love this place and yes, totally worth coming back to enjoy some delicious appetizers/cold beer or wine",

On an occasion of bringing my parents to this place which they had never been, my mother forgot her reading glasses. She couldn't see the menu and my father and I were trying to read her the menu. Our waitress noticed and brought over a few loaner pairs for my mother to borrow for her order. She went out of her way to notice and it was great to know they had something like that to offer!! Great to have service that went above and beyond!   I frequent this establishment and will continue because of the service and quality of delicious food!",

The chicken was hiding in the salad and it was just pieces of cold chicken that had been torn off of some left over chicken. There was dark and light meat. It was awful! I tried one piece of the chicken and pushed the other pieces to the side of my plate. I would never recommend this restaurant and I definitely will not be going back. Wish I had gone to Chipotle! It would've been much more tasty, filling and inexpensive!!",

I was eating with my parents and their friends and honestly didn't say a word once the plate went down in front of me to the moment I had scraped up the last bit. Scallops and the Arizona desert, at first, dont appear to be a match made in heaven. But these guys conquered any obstacles and served up some of the tastiest scallops. They could be considered \"rib-sticking\". WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SCALLOPS COULD BE RIB-STICKING???  Also, had a bite of my mom's short ribs which were to die for. They were dressed in this hoisin glaze; meat was falling off the bone; making me tear up, the memory is so beautiful.   beyond that, I finished my meal with a root beer float. I kinda just wanted root bear and ice cream because of my basicness but even with this dish wow-ed me bc of the house-made whip cream they placed on top.    All in all, if you want some bombastic comfort food, come to this place. You will leave feeling warm and fuzzy",

I had the portabello sandwich which was almost like a melt, minus the cheese.. But I dug the toasted bread and the fries were fantastic as well!   Prices were good, service was great, and they even had Pumpkin Pie for desert which I pretty much forced Ashley to get just so I could smell it!  It was topped with fresh whipped cream and cinnamon!  Looked amazing!  This is a good spot!    I dug the bathrooms with classic Rolling Stone Magazine's in Frames but I could have done without the one with 9/11 on the cover!

    "text": "Having dined here at least four times, twice at the bar, once at patio area, and once at an indoor table, I have to say that dining at the bar is the way to go.  It's livelier at the bar, as I may keep to myself, or chat with the people sitting next to me, which is what I did this afternoon!  I wasn't sure I'd dine in, but I knew I wanted to take home one of Grassroots homemade Coconut cream pie ($20). <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grassroots-kitchen-and-tap-scottsdale?select=Z6WQVZ0It7zIJ8J6ePmwvw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gras...</a>  Yessir!  One whole pie, please!  The bartender sounded so surprised!  He tried to get me to buy the pumpkin pie, as well (I'd called earlier to find out what the Pie of the Day was, and I was told there were two, so I was hoping to let fate decide...), but since pumpkin pie will have its spotlight in about fifteen days, I decided I'd go with the coconut, which was also what bartender said he'd rather have.    I decided I'd enjoy a $6 glass (during hh) of a Georgia Iced Tea (360 peach vodka, Appleton rum, peach puree, lemonade, and iced tea; SO good!) and try the $14 plate of Smoked Brisket, pickles on the side, please! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grassroots-kitchen-and-tap-scottsdale?select=50beHLTdqnZc1r2dRWtY3w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gras...</a>  The cherry- and applewood-smoked brisket came with BBQ'd slaw, mayo, and local pickle chips (but not mine!) on a French baguette.  It was very tasty, but I kept wishing that the French baguette was more crisped on the outside.  The bread's texture felt like it was steamed-- too soft.  I originally ordered the sandwich to come with Pork belly baked beans, but when another guest asked what time it was, and I learned it was 5 pm, I asked if I could change my side order to a loaded baked potato, which is only available as a side from 5 pm onward.  No problem.  I only had a few forkfuls, but the toppings and large potato, crisped skin on the outside and fluffy on the inside, tasted great.  Saved most of it, as well as the other half of the smoked brisket sandwich for Mommy dearest.  It was a fun afternoon, with a refreshing peach beverage and delicious food, while chatting with the neighbors: Mary on my left, who was having a glass of chardonnay-- thank you for offering me a taste of your side of tasty coleslaw (!); and the couple on my right, who arrived after I'd received my entree-- it looked so enticing, and they'd never tried it, so they decided to share one.  I hope you two enjoyed it!  FYI, the kitchen couldn't, or wouldn't, let me have a thin slice of the pie to enjoy at the bar, so I had to wait till I arrived home to set up this money shot...  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grassroots-kitchen-and-tap-scottsdale?select=ErJEo1UOxzJg8pIrXQaI-w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gras...</a>",

It was a little on the pricey side for a weeknight, but not bad for a date night! I love the urban garden feel of the restaurant. The waitresses and waiters are 5 star service.

We had the sweet roll sliders with brisket which was much different than the other location. The brisket was sliced instead of chopped into smaller pieces and it was less saucy. It was still good, just different. We also got the happy hour wings, which were tiny and not very flavorful, the jalapeno grits which were not very flavorful either. We also had the waldorf salad which was really delicious and fresh. I would definitely get that again.",

    "text": "The inside the inviting doors of North Scottsdale's Grass Roots... the chic and rustic decor flaunts brick interior walls, mason jar lighting fixtures, and garage door walls that roll up exposing the charming patio.  A horseshoe shaped bar demands your attention the moment you walk through the doorway -- boasting wines on tap from America's premier vineyards in California, Oregon & Washington... a nice selection of domestic beers, and unique list of hand-crafted cocktails.  ... But the food is where the real love affair began for me.  Smoked brisket sliders...  If you make it in for \"social hour\" (Grass Root's version of happy hour) do yourself a solid and order these -- as they are not on the regular menu!!  I can still taste those tender sheets of beef, smothered in tangy bbq sauce -- snuggled between the buns of a Hawaiian sweet roll.  And just when you think they couldn't possibly taste any better,  you discover a slice of homemade pickle hiding under the top bun...  ...POW! The perfect compliment to the sweetness of the sauce. Sheer genius!!  It's Burratta... I'm in love  Prepare to be whisked away with this build-your-own bruschetta platter. When the dreamy combination hits your lips, you'll keep going back for more.  Crispy grilled bread topped with creamy mozzarella, a slathering of the sweet and spicy tomato jam and a pinch of lightly dressed arugula salad.  It's the perfect way to start a meal, and there's enough to share... if you HAVE to. :-)  Downright Tasty Short Ribs...  You'd think these inspired Willie Nelson's hit song \"I Fall To Pieces\"... Cause that's exactly what they do! (Bonus points if you sang the chorus out loud ;-) This fork-tender heap of beef is slow braised and smothered in a sweet reduction of its own succulent juices.  This dish also features the Jalapeno-cheddar polenta. This savory concoction isn't spicy. It hits you with burst of cheesy goodness with a fresh jalapeno finish -- without sending your mouth screaming into the night.   Step 1 - load fork with a chunk of short rib...  Step 2 - scoop a heap of Polenta right on behind it...  Step 3 - party in your mouth...  Grass Roots is the perfect spot to experience great food, in a casual and lively atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and the service is good. :-)  With food and love, -Ashley  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FForkMeDaily.com&s=643e09e3b7917a7ed74eca7a27eddfc77b89d2ba716cfca71d38d8ff139fb7ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ForkMeDaily.com</a>",

It was so tender that I could cut it with my fork. Rarely do any restaurant around here cook such meat to perfection. Additionally, it was packed with flavor. The asparagus and grits that came on the side were also memorably delectable. Near the end of the meal, the server treated me to a free dessert. Having a hard time choosing between all that they offer, I decided to go with the key lime pie. When I tell you that this was the best key lime pie I've ever had, I mean it to the fullest extent. The filling was made from scratch and tasted the part. The only downside to that dish was the crust. (I am being hard on them in regards to that since I am a pie perfectionist myself.) Otherwise, I couldn't complain about anything that they had to offer.",

I was in Scottsdale for the night on business and stopped into Grassroots with no expectations.  It was a Tuesday night and the place was surprisingly pretty packed.  I found the one lone seat at the bar and was promptly greeted by a friendly bartender.    I saw the couple next to me order a cup of soup and it looked good (I'm a creepy food peeper), so I decided to try it.  The soup of the day was Chicken Tortilla.  I was planning on picking the tortilla strips out, but there was cheese stuck to them and I couldn't fathom wasting cheese, so I took one for the team and ate them.  The soup was seriously to die for.  As I was eating it, I was texting a friend and explaining how I would be bathing in that soup if hadn't just showered.  THAT's how good it was.    I also tried the Cardiff salad which was a chopped salad with shrimp.  It was one of the best salads I've ever had.  I went in there starving, and could only finish half the salad.  It was loaded with shrimp, and the dressing was amazing.  The atmosphere is classy and trendy, the staff is super efficient and pleasant.  If I'm back in the area, I will definitely re-visit.",

The shrimp poorboy was very good and brought me back to my visits to New Orleans. The hamburger was very juicy and full of flavor. Each time I ordered the coleslaw as my side and must say the coleslaw is the best I have ever tasted. For dinner I ordered the pork chop which came with the grits. The pork chop was cooked perfect and full of flavor and the grits had some spice and I very much enjoyed. Owner Chris Collins surprised us with the pork-belly appetizer and I must say it was very very good. The wine list is very reasonable and the service is second to none. This place will have plenty of success and we will continue to frequent for lunch and dinner.",

Our server was great, she came prepared with good recommendations and a smile. My short ribs were wonderful, and they were on some seriously creamy delicious grits, A+!

The restaurant provides seating variety - around the bar, a common table and standard two and four tops. The service was casual yet professional with very friendly and knowledgeable servers. Lunch is a busy time, so reserve or expect a little wait for a table. We opted for a bar seat which worked perfectly. Now, onto the food.  Grassroots offers a varied and local menu. I'm sure you will notice that that the shrimp and grits is frequently reviewed (and ordered) for a reason - it's awesome.  The dish is well balanced and delivers the right mix of cheese gooey-ness and spice. It is not very southern, but this is Scottsdale...Order it! My lunch companion selected the ahi, also excellent and worth consideration. The key lime pie is sublime.   Overall, a great restaurant and my new goto haunt for a special occasion lunch around the office.  Hope you enjoy it as well.",

First they had two booths available but refused to let us sit there because they don't let reserve booths ...well except if you happen to be a bigger party. We waited at the bar and when a booth was available but the hostess didn't offer to help carry very full drinks. (And told us to clear the bar tab which we actually didn't have to ). I mentioned to her that it's good customer service to help carry drinks and them she went to the other hostess and was laughing about my comments. I requested to talk to the manager (whom happened to be the owner) and whom came with an attitude. He said he hadn't trained his staff to do that and he saw his restaurant as a neighborhood restaurant. Not sure what that had to do with good customer service and it did't help when he impatiently tapped his hand while talking to us. First don't be be defensive about feedback. Second, listen with the intent of caring about the customer. Lastly, aspire to be something great rather than average for your customer..

We were going to check out the Spotted Donkey, but finding it out of business, we noticed Grassroots across the parking lot and decided to check it out.  My daughter got the brisket sandwich (she let me try a bite - nice combination of BBQ sauce, slaw and pickles - but she picked out the pickles and slaw!)  The fries were quite nice as well.  I tried the short ribs - asian fusion sauce with asparagus and jalapeno cheesy grits...I've never been a fan of grits, but these were tasty!  The ribs were very nice...the sauce reminded me of something my Mom used to make (but I can't quite put my finger on what it was, but it was familiar).  A browned with toffee flakes and gelato on top capped off a very nice dinner.  (And you've gotta love a place that has the Gadsden flag as part of it's decor).  Definitely will be coming back!  (and my apologies to our attentive and helpful server for not having been more demonstrative of my appreciation for the food...it was quite good, I just wasn't in a 'dang that's good!' mood last night)  Check this place out!!",

The server also was very knowledgeable and friendly. I would lean more towards 4 stars over 3 stars for this restaurant and I think had we sat out on the patio, it might have been a concrete 4 star experience... The Ambiance and decor was a bit lackluster inside....Don't get me wrong, the restaurant is clean, and there is some artistic flair, but I just wasn't wow'd by the experience.  Patio did look very inviting.      The only thing locally sourced on the menu was broccoli by McClelland Farms. I personally would like to see more locally sourced vegetables and potentially chicken/pork at the very least.   Other than, that as charming as this restaurant happens to be--- not sure if I will be able to go back, simply because I live in Chandler. If this was a neighborhood spot, I would definitely go back. But, not sure it's worth a second trip given the long drive.  Enjoy!!",

I was happy to find out that this fellow that owns this place is a relative (son I think but I don't want to start rumors) of the folks who own Wally's American Pub - one of my favorite places to go when I lived in Arcadia.  I really like to keep it local whenever possible!",

    "text": "I've been working in the Village at Hayden complex for over 4 years now, and my family has owned a business in the complex for over 15, so I've eaten at all the restaurants that have been in (and out) of the complex over the last decade and a half at least once, if not more.   It's owned by The Collins Family, proprietors of Wally's American Pub. The concept is really exciting to me. It's all about American favorites made with mostly local and always fresh ingredients of the highest quality. The decor is soothing, with excellent jazz-styled music for listening pleasure. The booths are large and comfortable, and the entrance for the patio is through garage-style doors. Unique, inviting, and pleasing to the eye. The other detail I noticed and loved was the weight of the flatwear. Maybe it's just me, but I really prefer eating a good meal with heavy and comfortable utensils.   The cuisine is what you're really concerned with, so I'll get to that now (finally!).  The only appetizer I've tried so far (because it's so amazing I can't stop ordering it!) is Dad's Grocery Bag. It comes with 3 cheeses (Manchego, Fresh Goat's Milk and Paremesean), 3 meats (Soppressata, Prosciutto and Capocollo), French loaf, olives, nuts and honey comb plated on a wooden cutting board, with the honey comb resting on a long-handled spoon. Now, if only my dad's grocery bag really carried all these delights when I was a little girl!  I'm a salad girl, largely because of my grain allergy (I save my grain consumption for delights like the bread and a craft brew), and they knocked the Seasonal Vegetable Chop out of the park. Tomatoes, beets, grapes, squash, corn, tomatoes, cabbage, manchego cheese and butter beans tossed in a parsley creamy champagne vinaigrette. Excellently executed, and something I would eat every day for the rest of my many-remaining days if I could afford to do so.   I've heard from a reliable source (my father, who is something of a fish nut) that the Blackened Red Fish was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection, as was the dirty orzo. And the Grilled Angus Burger is a serious meat-eaters delight, with excellent ground chuck and fresh veggies with Tillamook Cheddar.   Oh. And their hot tea! It's LOOSE LEAF brought to you in a nice little teapot. If only every dining establishment would recognize that loose leaf is so vastly superior to the bagged teas. Maybe they'll catch on soon.  For a restaurant that has been open less than a month, I have to say that they've completely hit it out of the park. My new fav lunch spot, in a complex where the Spotted Donkey, Zipps, and Tandoori Times vie for that spot. The Collins Family has another hit.",

He was so knowledgeable, easy to talk to and recommended the dishes for our entire dining experience.  First, we started with the Burrata appetizer, to die for, I could've eaten the entire plate on my own.  We shared the chop salad, the ingredients were so fresh and the bacon added that nice salty punch. Onto our entrees, my husband had the spitfire chicken and I had the short ribs.  The portions were generous!  The chicken was tender, juicy and flavorful.  The short ribs were falling off the virtual bone, no knife needed for this one.  The cheddar jalapeno grits are a must!  We were so full but Tatum described the homemade pies in a way were we could not refuse!  We had to order 2 slices, the coconut cream and the key lime.  What a perfect way to end our perfect dinner!  Tatum, keep doing what you're doing!  We will be back to see you again!",

    "text": "I'm torn.  This place is so darn charming, a very warm atmosphere, much cozier than its previous identity.  The service during my--brief--visit was amazing: I was waited on immediately upon entering the door, but I wanted to order something TO GO, so I bellied up to the bar for a menu.  My first thought?  The menu is boring.  Nothing about it makes it stand out.  \"What is new and different here?,\" is what I thought to myself.  \"What is the ONE THING that will bring people back again and again?\", I thought to myself.  I was told the chopped salad was amazing, so I ordered it.  In the meantime, I ordered a glass of wine.  I had only been there a few short minutes, when another server came over to ask if I would like to try some other red wines.  Perhaps it was chance, but I noticed, she brought two reds in the same \"family\" of that which I was drinking.  Very observant, I thought to myself.  I wasn't happy with either, really, and I was definitely not happy with the glass I ordered, so the bartender took it off the bill at the time my food arrived.  Terrific!  I took home my salad, opened it, and was immediately disappointed.  It was not fresh, and I expected the chicken breast to be hot, which it was not.  The greens weren't even \"juicy,\" but rather tasted as though they had been in the refrigerator WAAAY too long.  Not even close to amazing, as I was told.  So, I may return and eat in the restaurant because I think it is only fair, but I have to say, I'm not very enthusiastic about it.  :-(",

    "text": "Caught the tail end of the social hour and ordered the \"Piggly Wiggly\" appetizer, and was treated to some of the best baby back ribs I've had in a long time, and pork belly with a spicy jam and delectable garlic toast oozing with buttery goodness - all on one plate!  Granted, those items are much more expensive when ordered separately, so the social hour is the way to go for the best value!  (...the social hour is the call for easy seating too - we sat right down at 5:00pm, and by the time we left at 6:30, there was a line of people waiting to be seated.)  Make a reservation if you don't want to wait, the place is not very big.  I give Grassroots Kitchen and Tap 5 stars, because everything we had was delicious, and the value, quality, and portion size was exactly as expected for this type of establishment.  Locally grown produce and organics are more expensive than conventionally grown ingredients, so one would expect that to be reflected on the right side of the menu.  One of the other reviews asks:  What is the one thing on the menu that will keep people coming back again and again?  ...I have an answer to that question; according to my taste-buds it's: ...The baby-back ribs ...The vegetable salad ...The pork belly ...The tuna poke (despite the fact that it has shrimp in it, which could be considered sacrilegious to die-hard poke aficionados) ...And the BEST jalapeno grits we've ever had!  (Note about the jalapeno grits - if you are the kind of person that enjoys the overly-spicy, heavy-handed chili and cheese grits such as are served at places like The Mission, you won't like these.  The jalapeno grits at Grassroots are delicately spiced and mild, with just a touch of kick for flavor - muy delicioso!)  We are really looking forward to going back and trying more, though it is going to be hard to not repeat the items we already know we love.",

    "text": "Met a girlfriend here for lunch. Was on a 10 day detox so my choices for food were limited but I was not worried coming to a place like this. I knew regardless of my food restrictions even if I was the world's pickiest eater, I was in good hands.  My girlfriend ordered their ahi tuna salad and I ordered their chopped salad with no dressing. Basically a bowl of variety of chopped veggies, raw, nothing else added. The salad came with feta and as I was not doing feta as part of the cleanse, I explained this to the waiter. With a smile, he whisks it away and promptly comes back with a salad with no feta.  Although my girlfriend doubtfully asked if the salad was tasty with no dressing, no feta, nada nada except for a bowl of delightfully fresh veggies, the salad was indeed extremely flavorful with the mix of beet, corm, and bounty of other goodness.    The key is freshness and Grassroots had plenty of it! I wish most people would realize that with the right combinations of greens and vegetables, the flavors of just the natural goodness packs plenty of flavor. No dressing needed. No feta or any cheese needed. It's a cleansing of the palate and the body.  I digress. Okay, Grassroots was everything I expected. Even though it was my first time here, I just knew their menu and service would be excellent and I was not disappointed!!!",

But regardless where you sit, this place is wonderful, it has a modern southern vibe to it ... very warm and cozy ... and certainly has the southern hospitality.    Service is top notch and totally 5 starts ... sometime you can just tell when people are truly sincere and concern about you as a customer ... this is one of the few places make me feel that way.    As for the food, ordered the tuna poke which was very refreshing especially for the summer, the miso glazed salmon which has the perfect favor but just slightly overcook. But this could be just a one time miss .... as for the ribs ... the favor is awesome and serving is plentiful ... but I love the grits come with it the most (I never liked grits but oh  boy, they gave me a brand new definition of grits now)  A wonderful place to hang out too :)",

    "text": "I've been eager to try Grassroots since it opened a month ago.  After our experience last night I'm torn between three and four stars.  If we had been seated at an actual table I think I'd be more generous.    We walk in and were told that there's a 45-minute wait.  Okay, so it was a Friday night--this is understandable.  We put our name down and wait outside.  Three minutes later the hostess informs us that our table is ready.  Interesting.  We were seated at a community table next to some older men who were drinking martinis and eating appetizers.  I'm not sure if we got shafted with this one.  I had to put my precious Kate Spade bag on the floor because there were no extra stools or hooks to hang it on.  That in itself made me want to leave.   The menu consists of fish, ribs, chicken, salads, sandwiches and a few a la carte sides.  The items are pricey and the portions are small.  The tuna poke appetizer was bigger than my ahi tuna salad entree.  I was most impressed with the poke; the tuna and shrimp were incredibly fresh and there was a nice kick of acidity.    Our waiter said that the ahi tuna salad was \"lighter\" but reassured me that the portion size would fill me up.  Liar!  I wish there were three times more greens on the plate.  The salad was quite tasty but the ahi was a little overdone for my taste.  I enjoyed the soy ponzu vinaigrette and I requested some wasabi on the side for a kick.  Sadly, there was no ginger on site to accompany the tuna.  We had to grab a second dinner in Old Town to feel fully satisfied.    The crowd here isn't exactly my generation...we were youngest couple in the entire place.  I could return, but there are many other place I'd like to try before I do.  It's a good place to go if you're older and want a light bite.",

    "text": "Loved everything about this place!  Great service, Vanessa was our very nice and attentive server. Great layout and ambience of the restaurant. Awesome food!   My husband and I came here for dinner on a Monday night, the place was pretty full. I liked the fact that they have outdoor areas for dining, a big bar area with TVs, as well as tables for seating inside. The big roll up garage type doors add to the decor but also make the outside and inside areas cohesive!   We enjoyed all the food we tried from start to finish. All the ingredients were fresh and all the dishes were well prepared. Loved how everything was simple and to the point and not overly dressed up like some restaurants can get.   Starters:  -House-made smoked salmon: When it says for sharing, you definitely want to share this one. The portion of the fish was large, I thought it was an entree. Perfectly smoked.  -Red beans and rice soup: Great flavor profile for a soup with simple ingredients.  -Farmer's vegetable chop: Nice and crisp, perfect for a warm night. All the ingredients inside of the salad complemented each other very well.  Entrees: -Topher's Braised Short Ribs: The meat was tender.  -'Roti' & Rib Combo: Both the chicken and ribs were cooked perfectly. The chicken was nice and juicy and the rib meat was falling off of the bone.   Desserts: (Definitely do not pass up on dessert!) -Key Lime Pie: Since I am a fan of this type of pie, I had to get it. The texture was nice and smooth. Loved how it was not too tart and not too sweet. The bite of the crust finished the pie perfectly.  -Coconut Cream Pie: (One of the best I have had, so much so we tried to come back the next day but they sold out during lunch service)  The reason why I loved this pie was because it wasn't your ordinary coconut cream pie where it's super fluffy. The filling was more dense almost like a thin layer of thicker cheesecake but still smooth and packed with coconut flavor. The thicker more caramelized crust and toasted coconut on top completed this awesome pie! *Seems like they change their featured pies...not sure if it's weekly or monthly.   When we are in town visiting Arizona again, we will definitely come back and eat at this restaurant.   Restrooms: Separate restrooms for men and women. The women's restroom has two stalls, it was clean and stocked. I enjoyed looking at the Rolling Stones magazine covers that they hung up as the decor.",

After finding the hostess and requesting a visit from our server, we ordered drinks and appetizers...the drinks arrived, didn't see the server again until our entrees arrived - minus the appetizers. The server's response when asked about the issue - \"The appetizers didn't get made\". Very dismissive, no apology, totally unprofessional. Bottom line - spend your money elsewhere.",

    "text": "I like Grassroots for several reasons:  1. Good service. Everyone is nice, attentive, and the recommendations are usually very good. 2. Happy hour, or as they like to call it, social hour, features several good appetizers and drinks at reasonable prices. Some happy hours don't really seem like a good deal but Grassroots does a nice job. 3. Lots of tasty, light beers on tap that go well with the year round warm to hot Phoenix weather. 4. Burrata is yummay and I love the accompanying sweet tomato chutney. The sliders are actually really good and the beef is moist and tender.  Give it a go. There's something for everyone on the menu.",

The special with scallops and their specialized grits was great.  Another had the beef brisket sliders and shrimp with grits.  I has the salmon and ceasar salad.  All excellent.  Oh and the brownie was huge with homemade vanilla bean ice cream for dessert was delicious!  Adam was our server, and he was fantastic!",

My husband is very Italian and can be boisterous and fun,  however tonight we were having a quiet drink. After 2 rounds the operations manager for Grass Roots, Wally's Gastoro pub ( yuk) and Twisted Grove cut my husband off. We were sitting quietly at the bar. The bartenders had no idea what was  going on and were as surprised as we were! Bottom line is I  would not spend money at any establishment owed by Chris Collins. I am sure his father, the REAL WALLY and a great host is horribly disappointed. Go to Zipps. Much friendlier!!!",

The restaurant is very clean looking and the decor is really nice and inviting.  We sat in the patio since the weather is so beautiful this time of year.  I had a glass of bubbly and Shrimp and Grits.  Yeehaw, those were some tasty grits.  A little bit large a portion of grits, but my hubby always has some of my food anyways.  A girl has to stay fabulous somehow, even at my hubby's not so svelte figure expense.  I had not had grits in over 10 years.  They were very creamy, with enough cheddar and jalapeno flavor.  My hubby had the shrimp Po Boy, a very tasty sandwich.  I was too full to try their desserts, even though they looked so tempting.  I guess I have to come back for some more.",

    "text": "I have been coming to this quite gem of a place for several months now.  Grassroots is also owned by the same folks as Twisted Grove which is about 100 feet away.  What Grassroots lacks is snobbery and attitude, which is refreshing and often found in abundance in Old Town.  Such a welcome change.   The atmosphere can be described as a refined casual.  You will not be blown away by flash and glitz and tuxedo clad servers where some self-entitled customer is attempting to impress his date or friends.  What you will find is setting of warmth that is conducive to building a closeness, friendliness and intimacy that we all tend to seek when we share a meal with.    The menu may appear to be on the smaller side.  However, there is enough breath in the selections to satisfy anyone's desire.  Additionally, what seems to be a staple item within restaurants, Grassroots adds their own special flair to create something unique and make it their own.  For example, their \"boat load of wings\" is balanced very well between the chicken and wing sauce.  Whereas many restaurants tend to smoother the chicken with the sauce.  The ahi tuna salad is as delicious as it looks.  Furthermore, there is a consistency if the quality that will keep you returning  The glue that holds this establishment together is the staff.  They truly set the tone her from the moment you walk through the door.  Mangers Brittney and Shane will always greet you with a smile and humble enough to pitch in to help the servers.  Behind the bar, you might find Tatum who is True gentleman.  Also behind the bar you might find, Megan always attentive to the customer with a sparkling smile.  Joe who is warm and engaging and be your best friend by the time you leave.  On the floor, you might be lucky enough to meet Sarah who will keep you smiling throughout your meal.    Grassroots is very focused on the local market, catering to the locals cultivating repeat business, as opposed to the tourist and hipster crowds of Old Town.  Owner Chris, has done an exceptional job of staff selection and training as each member of his team is customer focused.  More impressive is  that they very much appear to care about delivering a quality product and experience rather than delivering an image and collecting a pay check.  Closing notes:  Try the Key Lime Pie, even share it if you must.  Also, the clock on the wall behind the bar is not a real clock do not rely on it if you need to be somewhere (Guys, can we get a real one that fits into the decor?)",

From the waitress and chefs having perfect timing (in regards to bringing out dishes, refills, drink orders, staggering the appetizers, etc.) all the way to the delicious tuna steak. The lighting was dim, but not so dark that I couldn't see my date. The ambient sound was JUST enough to break silence but didn't overshadow my conversations. My date was super happy that I brought her there, and seeing how it didn't work out between us, I will be bringing more dates to grassroots for sure!!",

The ahi poke chips were so delicious and wonderfully made I wish I had more! Although it would be nice to have more chips, the portion size was very generous with poke and fresh avocado. Also very perfectly seasoned. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it.   Next was the entree of a whole rack of ribs and and skinny French fries! The rack of ribs were so flavorful and perfectly marinated my tummy was happy by the end of it! The fries were also plentiful and being a fry lover myself, I was extremely happy with my choice.   Last was the key lime pie. This was one of the best key lime pies I've been had (note that I haven't eat that many in my lifetime though)! It wasn't too sweet and it sufficed perfectly to end the meal.   I came with my coworkers so we had a large group of 11 people. The waiters were nice enough to provide everyone with key lime pies and brownies with a scoop of ice cream!   Overall, best place I've had in Arizona. Highly recommend and would definitely come back if I visit again!! Absolutely loved it.",

The ribs were good and the entree was plentiful with more ribs than I could share and eat and a ton of their crispy shoestring fries which were great. Instead of ordering two meals (we're light eaters), we ordered a side of beans and a loaded baked potato and shared.  With the starter and dessert, we didn't even finish one of the items between the two of us!  They are very generous.  Our starter was the burrata and it came with a huge amount of toast!  It was very tasty with the tomato relish and dressed arugula.  The chocolate toffee brownie dessert was super yummy too!",

The menu options were wonderful- complete with a kids menu.  I love that the kids meals were served on sectioned plates - keeping grapes separate from Mac and cheese and fries. Made eating with a 2-year old much easier!   We got an order of wings to start.  I loved that they were smaller and plentiful- easier for sharing. Get the short ribs and jalapeno cheese grits with asparagus!  The sauce was fabulous. So yummy!  The pork chop was also quite tasty.    Great options for happy hour - applies to wine, beer, cocktails and shareables.  Service was superb, and they even charmed the 2-year old.    We will be back.  So many more options to try.",

    "text": "Great place.  Very happy we chose to eat at Grassroots.  Entire staff is very nice and accommodating.  From the hostess to the bartenders to the wait staff...they are all super.    Made a table thru Open Table for 8:15 pm...we showed up about 30 minute early.  Had a drink at the bar and before we finished, they table was ready.    I ordered the baby back ribs and shoestring potatoes.  Wow.  Those might have been the best restaurant ribs I have ever had.  They fell off the bone and the Carolina-style barbeque sauce was really good.  My wife had the Shrimp and Grits...again, very tasty.    The other thing I like about the restaurant was that it was not very loud.  Some restaurants feel they need to crank up the volume for you to enjoy dinner.  Grassroots is not \"hear a pin drop quiet\"...but it is not loud either.  You could go with a group of 4 or 6 and have a nice conversation.    Here for another week...we will make at least one trip back before we head home.    Thanks Grassroots!",

    "text": "the food....the food is excellent. as it was on our last meal there. i was impressed before and i was impressed again with my food. the fish sandwich was cooked perfectly, the bread was crispy yet soft. my side of cheese grits with jalapeno was creamy and not over powered by the jalapeno. my wife loved her farm vegetable plate. i snuck a few bites and had to agree....tasty.   our party was there for 3 hours. i feel like i'm being nitpicky when i complain about not having my water glass filled, but as my wife has mentioned before...i go out not only for the food, but for the service/experience. and my water glass was filled once...let me correct that....i had to ask for my water glass to be filled 3 times.   i don't know if she was the only server, but she was non-existent. after we were seated, literally 15 minutes before she made herself known just for drinks. other than that, we basically didn't see her except when she stopped by to ask us if we wanted dessert. our food was brought out timely, but it was another 15-25 minutes before we got our drinks until our food order was taken.   again, a number of factors could have been involved. it was busy last night, maybe a server called in sick, maybe they were trying to convey a european sense of dining, however, i was so thirsty when we left, i drank nearly a gallon of water when we got home.   this place has excellent food and on our previous visit, the service was great. so we'll go back i'm sure. this was just an oddity i hope.",

The Cardiff salad is another one of my favorites. The ingredients always seem high quality and very fresh. They have a great selections of salads/sandwiches, I've tried a few and have never been disappointed. Lots of tasty southern comfort food.   Service has always been excellent - attentive and friendly. They have a great patio that is enclosed during the winter months with heaters so it stays comfortable even on chilly nights. And for dessert, I'm obsessed with their toffee brownie with vanilla ice cream. It's stupid good.   It can get busy - if you show up during prime lunch/dinner hours, expect to wait.",

    "text": "Grassroots Kitchen will not disappoint. They are up on all the modern food trends and service was overall very strong. I was visiting from out of town and decided to check them out based on a solid online reviews. The place appears to be a popular hangout, it was pretty busy when we got there despite showing availabilities at all times on Open Table. We had to wait about 20 minutes after our original reservation because they were seating an unusually large group, but the hostess was gracious and seated us on their very nice covered patio. Weather was great this time of year. Our waitress was similarly very friendly!   We started out with an order of their pork belly, which was excellent. They served it with candied pancetta on top, plus bread and a tomato jam that was excellent. GF got the Ahi Tuna for the main course, but I got the Braised Short Ribs based on the online recommendations. Let me tell you, make sure someone you are with orders this, it is superb. They put a bit too much sauce on it though. With meat like they made, they should let it shine without too many distractions. The jalapeno grits were similarly tasty, nice bite but not stupidly hot. Finally, the key lime pie was perfect. We went to another restaurant with twice the tab and the pie didn't touch the slice we shared at Grassroots.    Eating as a couple, the whole meal plus two draught beers cost us about $82, which for the quality of the food was very fair. Great food with a fair price, and good service, that's five stars in my book.",

    "text": "Grassroots is by far the best surprise I've ever had. IN LIFE! EVER! Sorry. That's a little dramatic. But I am SO glad I finally stumbled upon this place.  I had some besties in town and we were looking to have a tasty night out to dinner after a vigorous day of hiking, college basketball and patio-hopping. I don't really know how or why I came to the decision of Grassroots, but BOY HOWDY (yep.) am I glad I did!  I used to work right over in this area and put Grassroots on my mental \"to-try\" list when it opened. Time got away from me, and I really have no idea why we just now tried it out, given how close it is to home. Nothing could prepare me for how glorious it was. Walking in, we were transplanted into someone's hip, modern kitchen with lots of Americana art adorning the sleek space. We were promptly sat at a high-top for 4 and perused the menu. We all ordered a cocktail (or beer) to start with, and my Hendricks/cucumber concoction was cool and refreshing.   Ordered:  ~Burrata app: Heaven. Creamy, dreamy burrata served alongside lightly dressed arugula and tomato jam. Served with lil grilled toasts. So perfect.  ~Seasonal vegetable chop for the table to share: Not sure why, but our order came with chicken on it? At a normal time I'm sure we would have sent back but we had already placed our dinner order and it was getting closer to the kitchen closing. No matter. Those who weren't eating meat just picked around. The plethora of veggies was outstanding! (Beets, grapes, bnut squash, corn, edamame, cucumber, herbs, cherry tomatoes, feta, I'm sure I'm leaving something out.)  My choice as my main was the grilled portobello sandwich, no mayo, add avocado. The combo of smokey porto, creamy avo and sharp, melty white cheddar was outstanding! The soft and warm sea salt foccacia was insanity. Paired with a side of fatty grilled asparagus spears, this meal was amazing. I also loved how they cut the sammie into tiny squares...easier to handle and inhale.  Friends ordered the sashimi ahi salad (was told the ahi was PERFECT and it actually went better with the champagne vin that came out with the chop salad rather than the miso vin), the vegetable platter (the sauteed cabbage with goat cheese was TO DIE) and my boyfriend said his burger was one of the most perfect orders ever.  With the meal, we ordered a bottle of the Rockus Bockus, which is a mix of Cab Franc and Zinfandel and was SO, SO perfect. Juicy, man. It's a new favorite.  Service was great, even though we stayed a little past closing. Whoops. (PLEASE SCOTTSDALE, HAVE SOME NICE PLACES LIKE THIS THAT STAY LATER THAN 10:00 ON THE WEEKENDS, PLEASE!) There were several groups still lingering over drinks while we left, which I don't blame them for. What a great place to hang out and enjoy delicious bites. We will be back!",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed in the customer service at Grassroots. In early February I went to Grassroots to set up a family dinner for 12. We looked at the accommodations and specifically requested the area by the patio which  had a large regular dinner table and regular chairs accommodating 12 people.  I said that we did not want to sit in the area by the bar because we had older people who needed backs on the chairs and we wanted a more private area. The young lady at the front said that she could not make the reservation as the Manager, Christopher Collins must make them for a party of 8 or more. She showed me the schedule and the date/area/time was available  on the schedule. I would have to contact Chris at 5 for him to make the reservation and  I was given his card. I called Christopher and explained what we needed and the area that we wanted to sit and why. He said the date/time and area in the restaurant was available He took my name, phone number and in return he gave me a confirmation reservation number. We arrived 15 minutes early only to be told we will be seated in the front , hightop table with no backs on the chair. I explained that was not  what we reserved . We were very specific about what we needed. The Manager Christopher came over and tried to say that I didn't request the back area. I told him you talked to me and I was specific and he knew it. He said he couldn't move the people although they just had received their menus. He did not respect our reservations. I asked him how could he let this happen? SILENCE. His alternative option was moving us to his \"New\" restaurant across the driveway. They were going through a \"soft opening\" and they could accommodate us. We had no choice as where can you get a place to eat on Friday night in Scottsdale for 12 At no time did he apologize or even to come over to see how the party was doing. The alternative restaurant was slow in service, obviously not ready for a party if 12. For spending over $600 it was disappointing and certainly not the expected family gathering. Most managers in the hospitality industry distinguish themselves when dealing with mistakes graciously and often generously.  Grassroots did not respect our reservations nor did they handle their mistake with any class.",

Definitely a popular spot for locals and definitely a spot for foodies to explore.    My group and I started with some Ahi Tuna Poke and the Pork Belly Pancetta.  I didn't care for the poke since it was fishy and the chips seemed somewhat stale.  The pork belly was quite fatty, but I like it like that; plus the thick bits of bacon gave it some texture.  The spicy tomato jam that came along with it made this dish pop!  For the entree I went for the Cajun Spiced Ahi Tuna sandwich since I wanting some fries.  Lightly grilled ahi with condiments of butter leaf, onions, avocado, and a Siracha mayo.   Hands down the Siracha mayo made this sandwich a delight.  Overall, the sandwich was okay in my books.  I really didn't care for the shoe string fries; thought I'd be getting thick fat fries from the looks of the place.  For dessert we ordered the Key Lime Pie and Banana Split.  Both were pretty darn good, but nothing too special.    Service overall was pretty good and on top of things.  Ambiance was borderline posh and some southern twang!  In the end, food was pretty good if you wanted to venture out a tad bit, but nothing to over the top! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "Grassroots is awesome! I had been past here before and had enjoyed other restaurants in this complex, but this weekend was my first time trying grassroots. Went here to celebrate my birthday with my family, and I am happy I did!  We got there at about 4:30, and it was not busy at all yet, but for the hour we were there it got busier and busier and was pretty packed by the end. For a good reason too because the food was awesome! We started with the common grounds Burrata for happy hour. It comes with fresh mozzarella, tomato jam, dressed arugula, and bread. You kind of get to assemble your own Burrata toast, and it was so delicious. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. It was a challenge to not completely fill up on that alone. For my meal I got the portobello sandwich (sans mayo) with fries. I wasn't all that crazy about the fries because I prefer thicker fries, but the sandwich was good. The bread was definitely my favorite part, grilled focaccia!  The highlight of my meal by far was the toffee brownie topped with vanilla ice cream. It was really big too! Very chocolatey and delicious. The only issue we had was my dad's beer was warm and foamy, but luckily this issue was fixed! The server gave him a different beer and did not charge us for either! Also we weren't charged for the brownie because it was my birthday! So the service was excellent. Not to mention the atmosphere is nice too, plus we got a huge comfortable booth. I'd come back for sure!",

Whether we're hosting or simply suggesting places for out of town visitors to dine, this is at the top of our list.    Side Note: Even if you don't think you like key lime pie, if you don't try theirs you are missing out.  If you're reading this review skeptically because it's updated don't.  The previous review was also 5 stars, but since I left it three years ago I wanted people to know I'm still just as satisfied today as I was then.",

My wife went to the bathroom to change our little one and found a wallet. She turned it in to the hostess and it turned out that it belonged to one of the employees. As a way to thank us they gave us two complimentary appetizers. It shows you the kind of establishment this place. The first was \"85259 creamy burrata\" which was really good. Everyone loved it. The  creamy burrata was very fresh and the tomato jam was uniquely delicious. The \"tuna poke\" was well seasoned and very fresh. Both were 5 stars.   For my main entree i got the \"topher's braised short ribs\" and they were really good. The short ribs had a sweet outer layer but they were savory on the inside. A great contrast of flavors. The jalapeno cheddar grits were perfect. Actually the best grits i have ever had. My wife got the \"roasted chicken waldorf\" and she really liked it. She said it was the perfect amount of dressing and all the fixings on it were well balanced. She really enjoyed it.   For dessert we got the chocolate toffee brownie a la mode. I thought this desert was tasty but it was not a home run like the main entrees. Overall i would come again. The staff is awesome, it is reasonably priced, and the food is prepared perfectly.",

    "text": "During our recent 4 nights in Scottsdale while staying in Kierland, we had the pleasure of eating at Grassroots. The menu was varied, but two items caught our attention; the blackened redfish, and the shrimp and jalapeno-cheese grits. More about the food in a sec, but the other highlight was our server Michelle. We wanted a nice slow, relaxing meal and she made that happen. She got my wife the cocktail (customized the way she likes it) knew the wine list and made a recommendation which was better than the wine I wanted to sample first, but she also knew the menu inside and out, and knew what went in to the making of each dish.  Now for the food: my wife's redfish was perfectly seasoned, spicy but not ridiculously so; just right. Now shrimp and grits is a real southern thing, and I try them anywhere I find them, and every place has their own unique way of doing them. In some places you get just shrimp and grits...kind of bland and boring, but not so at Grassroots. The shrimp are very nicely seasoned, and the grits are very mildly flavored with jalapeno, but the burst of flavor that pulled it all together is the andouille sausage gravy.  It was the best I've had anywhere.  Thanks Grassroots for a great evening.",

Great family environment, extremely friendly staff and very understanding to people who have food allergies, because food allergies suck anyway but it makes it worse when restaurants or servers don't take it seriously, not the case here.

    "text": "It's the night before my friends and I ran our first full marathon together and we scrambled to find the perfect restaurant that serves great tasting food that wouldn't be too hard on our stomachs - so somewhat healthy and fulfilling. We all agreed unanimously on Grassroots.  Although i really enjoyed eating their rack of ribs entree the first time I ever came to Grassroots, I knew it probably wouldn't be too good before our run. Our waitress pointed me to the Blackened Redfish with dirty orzo and sausage. I basically licked the plate dry. I really loved this dish! It was served with a Nola remoulade but the fish was full of flavor and almost didn't need that.   Topher's Braised Short Ribs with jalepeno cheddar grits was another major stand out. I'm not the hugest fan of grits. Typically, I'd have to smother a full stick of butter and a box of salt to make it enjoyable but who knew that jalepenos and cheddar could be a mind-changing combination?!  Key lime pie - definitely worth ordering! But it's kind of a lot to eat when you also order the banana split, so I would recommend getting one or the other at a single sitting.  Ahi poke with avocado - my hubs and I really enjoyed it but a couple of friends thought it was a tad on the fishy side. I was bewildered by the comment since it's ahi!  Pork belly appetizer - ours was a bit on the drier side but still flavorful.  Overall, we really enjoyed our dinner together. Service was on point, and the food paralleled the service. Who could ask for more?",

They describe themselves as \"Grassroots tempts with a from-scratch menu of classic Southern-influenced American cuisine, polished service-first style and a friends and family-focused vibe\". During our visit they delivered on almost all of their promise except for service.  Let me be precise: the service was good when the server showed up. Unfortunately many times when we needed the server she was MIA.  My sandwich was very good as were the choices of my dining companions. So four stars for food.  As for the ambiance nothing extraordinary.  As you might surmise, we were disappointed with the service.  This was my first time here and this may have been just a bad day for from a service standpoint.  So I will come back to see if this was just an anomaly or par for the course.",

In ordered the Brisket entree and my wife had the Pork Chop.  The latter was absolutely amazing.  The pork chop was subtlety sweet/salty with great char from the grill - and perfectly cooked.   The side of shoestring fries was surprisingly great.  Light and crispy without being greasy or crunchy.    My brisket was solid.  It was tender and had a nice flavor, but I think my perspective is too colored by Texas/Oklahoma style smoked brisket to enjoy this style.  I need the big smokiness and bark.  The BBQ sauce wasn't too much and the beans, while a bit too in-ur-face tangy to eat alone we're perfect as a dip for my wife's fries.  The jalapeno-cheddar grits were ridiculous.  I'm not the hugest fan of grits but damn!  These were outrageously delicious.  Notably, we ordered and ate way too much rich food for a midday meal, but surprisingly there was no real food coma and sluggish feeling afterward... a sign (in my amateurish opinion) of high quality, unprocessed ingredients.  All-in-all... Wonderful... and in the wake of the death of my favorite place of similar style (Ten), this could be a frequent option.",

I'm Celiac and need gluten-free options and this place was great. We sat at the bar and the bartenders and other customers were very friendly.  We started with the Pork Belly and it was very good. It was cooked perfectly and my wife who normally doesn't like high fat meats really liked this as well. The appetizer came on top of cheese-jalapeno grits and with pancetta and a jam (which was fantastic).    For dinner my wife got the shrimp and grits. She rated them as a 4/5 and was happy with her choice. I ordered the brisket on the bartenders recommendation and it was great! It was gluten-free and came with baked beans and cheese-jalapeno grits. The brisket was cooked perfectly as well and the bbq sauce was very flavorful. The baked beans were delicious and my wife loved them as well.  My wife ordered the Key Lime Pie for dessert and liked it.  It was very refreshing and had a good lime flavor. It was a little on the sweet side but overall would get it again.

I love a good burrata and tomato jam. Yum!",

I highly recommend getting the Scottish Salmon with the Chopped Salad and have had that 3 times in a row now! :)  There's always plenty of seating inside, outside, and at the bar during lunch.

The wings had great flavour, but the Poke was excellent-not soaked in vinegar to ruin the flavour.   After much indecision, I went for the Beef Short Rib. It was 2 large hunks of beef so tender that just looking at it caused it to fall apart. And the flavour!!  What topped it off for me was the grits. I typically don't like grits, because they are usually a tasteless slurry  pureed to the point of gagginess. In this case, the grits had an incredible crunch, behind a creamy texture and FLAVOUR!  I am so glad I had these grits, and so sorry that few restaurants will be anywhere close to getting them this good!",

This dish is in the section called small plates; however, it was large enough for me to have as my main course.  My friend had the chicken Waldorf salad, and she said it was very good. The portion was huge, and she took half of it home in a box.  It was chilly and rainy today or we would have enjoyed dining outside. The outdoor dining area is fairly large and quite attractive. It looked inviting, and I'll definitely try it next time. Having said this the inside was also very attractive and comfortable.  I will definitely be back and explore this fun menu further.",

The one criticism I would have was that we were never offered or given any water to drink while we waited for our actual drinks or to go along with the meal. The waitress explained the menu, their specials, and was able to answer our questions. Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time and all dishes were excellent. We ordered the brisket, rainbow trout, and the blackened red fish. The chef's vegetable for the night was the broccoli and it was very good!

I picked up my significant other from the airport and had the dog with us so we called ahead to make sure they were dog friendly, as advertised. They were, and when we got there the hostess lead us back out to the patio and got Ruckus water. Our server, and I cannot remember his name, was awesome. He helped us pick out drinks and food, with helpful suggestions. We got a glass of wine, Hall had a Red Bull Mule, both of which were great. Then we decided to get the sandwich of the day, a steak sandwich and a pulled pork sandwich. Both of which were DELICIOUS. the shoestring fries and garlic sauce suggested by our server was to die for. Not only did we have great service, but they were dog-friendly and the people dining there seemed to love it as much as we did. Next time we will return and sit in the oversized couches with friends. They looked so comfy. A++",

Whenever we have friends or family in town we make sure to take them here for a fantastic meal. Between the two of us we have tried most everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. Our favorite is probably the short ribs and jalapeno grits--let me tell you I don't even like grits or jalapenos normally, but I crave these ones! Their salads are also great--if you get chicken on it, they use their roasted chicken which is so flavorful. We always leave here too full for dessert sadly though because dessert is just as good as their entrees. I really can't say enough good things about Grassroots.",

We had to wait about 10 minutes, but thankfully a table opened up and we were seated promptly.  There aren't too many tables in this restaurant and the atmosphere is really nice, very open and clean.  Upon being seated, we were greeted and our server was very nice and helpful.  The food itself was very good.  I had the chicken salad sandwich without nuts (they were able to accommodate me) and my Grandma and Husband both had the brisket sandwich.  The chicken salad was very good, but the bread it was on was AWESOME!  It was buttery and toasted perfectly - so good.  The Hubs loved his, as did my Grandma and the grits, which I tried, were unique, creamy, and very flavorful. Grandma got the root beer float for dessert and loved it.  The Hubs and I shared a banana split, which I thought was just OK, the strawberry ice cream was my favorite part.  All in all, I cannot wait to go back to this restaurant.  I loved the menu and look forward to trying some different things out.  Happy hour looked good as well, so perhaps we will hit that up next.  Awesome new place to add to our go-tos!",

The restaurant is owned by the family that has Wally's, but it the food is much more refined and it is a nicer ambiance.  We had the prosciutto wrapped asparagus and pork belly for appetizers.  I am not usually a fan of asparagus, but when wrapped in prosciutto and drizzled with a honey sauce, I was able to enjoy it.  The pork belly was something I have always heard about on cooking shows, but never tried.  It was about three inches thick and served with caramelized pancetta (pork on pork, love it) a spicy tomato jam and toasted bread.  We weren't quite sure how to eat it, but once we dove in it was pure bliss. The pork was so tender and had a nice smoky flavor to it; paired with the spicy tomato jam it was a culinary experience I will not soon forget.  While I enjoyed the appetizers a lot, my main dish was even better!  I ordered the Shrimp and Grits, and having just been to New Orleans about six months ago, this dish rivaled those that I had down in the South.  The grits were doctored up with cheddar cheese and jalapenos, and were just heavenly, plus the portion was very generous, so there were plenty to share.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly (although a bit on the small side) in a sauce with andouille sausage; the dish got better and better with each bite!  My dad thoroughly enjoyed his rib-eye with blue cheese butter and my mom and sister both loved the seared ahi salad.  My dad told me he has previously tried the short ribs, and they were phenomenal, plus they are also served with the drool worthy grits.  The service was excellent, and the food was divine, I love finding a locally owned restaurant in my neighborhood that is actually good!",

Unfortunately,  I will not be recommending this place to anyone.  They do not seem to understand the concept of customer service.  While dining we were told \"no,\" way more than yes by our waitress.  The food was okay,  but certainly nothing to write home about. We waited a long time just to get our drinks refilled,  and the place wasn't even busy. On a lighter note,  the ambiance is cute, but there were a lot if fly's buzzing around and hanging out on our food,  which is never a good thing. Overall, there are a lot of dining options in Scottsdale,  I would  recommend going somewhere else.",

TV's overhead at the bar.   Now..the food, oh, the food. At happy hour my husband and I had the brisket sliders with Carolina barbecue sauce. You get three sliders with pickles and a subtle but not too sweet sauce, loved it as the vinegar flavor was excellent. The cost at happy hour is $5. We also had the wings which had The same sauce and were delicious. The club salad is excellent with a garlic dressing. The salmon is grilled and was moist. Would highly suggest this dish. The man next to me at the bar had the ribs which he was raving over.   So glad there is a new place I can go to in the neighborhood. If you come for dinner you can make a reservation .

They have a menu full of comfort food-like selections that doesn't overwhelm you with choices.  For an appitizer my table shared the barrata which was excellent and perfect to share because of it's size.  I was also surprised at the size of the short rib entree.  You get 3 large hunks of rib that were cooked perfectly.  The BBQ sauce was just ok but the meat was plenty flavorful and tender so it really didn't need much.  The grits were also delicious and a perfect compliment to the ribs.  The 2 under cooked asparagus spears were more for decoration than to be eaten though.  I also sampled the bbq brisket which was also very good.  As with the short rib, I prefer my meat a little fattier (I know, I'm sick) so it wasn't out of this world good for me.  All-in-all Grassroots was a good experience and I would return.  Next time I'm getting the shrimp and grits for sure.",

I ordered the Club House half-salad w/ chicken and had I been wearing socks, they would've been knocked right off of my tootsies.  We went at about noon, so parking was a little tricky, but as we approached someone pulled out *giggle* and we were able to get the rock star parking a pre-bday lunch enjoying girl should get. (If you saw some of the heels I wear, you'd probably sign a petition for me to get self-imposed handicap parking...you know, the handicap spots that you find that are nowhere near a door, but are still closer than BFE at the ass-end of Wallyworld?)  Anywho, since it was noon, there was a little bit of a wait (maybe 5-7 minutes) to sit inside however they have open seating at the bar and outdoor seating (which is what we went with). The temperature outside was oh-my-f'ing-holy-hell-hot for only 1-2 minutes, at this point we had our promptly delivered liquid refreshments and had become acclimated to the misters (for those not from hot places, those are the delightful mist contraptions they put on restaurant patios to keep guests cool, not a euphemism for the guys at the table...get it? Misters? lol)  The salad dressing they used was all I could think about for the rest of the day. It was phenomenal. The server was quick and efficient and the hostess was on the ball.

We ended with splitting a piece of key lime pie.  It was one of the best I have had from a restaurant.    I would recommend giving this place a try.  We plan to go back again before we leave Scottsdale.",

    "text": "Hopped over here after finding that our original destination, Spotted Donkey Cantina, had closed. The restaurant is definitely a nice one, with a wonderful atmosphere - relaxing, casual, yet upscale. I dined with my husband and another couple, and they all loved their food. I think I had less love simply because there weren't a lot of vegetarian options, and what I got was not all that special. However what my meat-eating friends got did look amazing and they all confirmed it.   I had the Grilled Portobello sandwich, and it was just fine. Not all that exciting (mushroom sandwiches and risotto are pretty boring to me since they are the de facto vegetarian options). My girlfriend got the club house salad and the Sunday soup of the day, and both looked awesome. The salad was big and full of cheese/meat toppings. The soup looked and smelled out of this world, and was a very substantial bowl of soup. My husband had the chicken and thought it was really good. I ordered the chocolate toffee brownie for dessert, and it was good however since toffee was in the title I was expected a lot of toffee, whereas there were just a few sprinkles of it.  I highly recommend Grassroots for the meat-eating population, but less so for those of us who only eat veggies.",

    "text": "With a name like Grassroots (basics), you would think that hospitality would be part of the customer experience. Not here unfortunately.  The owner/manager, is arrogant and basically a bully. He doesn't take feedback well nor does he train his employees properly to delight customers.  I was here for a business  meeting 4 days ago.  The food was ok. Service was ok.  I saw they had shrimp po'boy on the menu and told my husband about it.  I brought him here just for the po'boy, but unfortunately never made it to the food since the overall customer experience up to having drinks was not great.  We made a reservation for a booth, but when we got there they didn't have one.  They said they couldn't guarantee one. Why didn't they tell us that on the phone? We sat at the bar to have drinks, then within 10 minutes got moved to a table. No offer to help us move the drinks to the table .   We asked to speak to the manager. When he came over he was tapping his business card on the table. He immediately had a an attitude. He spoke to my husband telling him that he didn't train his employees to help move glasses to the tables. And he looked at me and said \"what about you?\" Huh? Not sure what that meant but I told him I had come here the other night and brought back my husband to try an item on the menu and he said \"keep 'em coming\" like I should keep coming back! We paid for our drinks and left.  Morale of the story here... Just because you own a restaurant doesn't mean you should. It's a customer service oriented business.  If you are not good at that don't own a restaurant or be smart hire a manager and staff that can provide great customer service.",

The fish sandwich was very good, and the jalapeno cheddar grits that I chose as the side REALLY had me hooked. Combined with the Prosciutto-wrapped asparagus app, and we knew we were coming back. On our return visit we went for the shrimp & grits entree to split, and an appetizer sampler from their happy hour menu that had a couple bbq ribs, pork belly, and a couple other items. Again, everything was amazing. (also, they have some great cocktails that are well priced at $6 each if you get there for HH. if it's not happy hour, i suggest splitting a carafe of Sangria.)  I will say, this place can be expensive if you get carried away (it's hard not to) or go for one of the higher-priced entrees, but there are plenty of well-priced options. Also, everything I've tasted has exceeded expectations and justified the price.",

I'm moving out of the valley and currently live in Central Phoenix. Scottsdale isn't a place I frequent often.  BUT, we were across the street signing the final documents at the title agency for the sale of our house, and we asked for a recommendation from our realtor for lunch. He said Grassroots. Nice and fresh. So away we went.  It was just before 1pm on a Friday afternoon. We walked in and they said immediate seating at the bar or a wait of about 15-25 minutes for a table. We opted to wait, though that ended up only being about 10 minutes (or it went by fast). Luckily they have adirondack chairs out front in the shade for relaxing.  We were seated on the patio, a little warm at first on a 100 degree day, but once the misters kicked on it was pleasant. Menu was appealing. Husband went with roti & ribs and I had the seared ahi tuna. Ribs were good, chicken was dry. Tuna was delicious (though they were unnecessarily heavy handed with the sauce) and the salad was tasty, but the cole slaw large and too much. Too much cabbage. We shared the key lime pie for dessert. It was light and creamy.  If you're in the area and want a nice fresh meal, try here.",

The first time we came here was for lunch while out shopping.  Not very creative orders on our part, but my. Wife and I both had the blackened fish sandwich.   Very well prepared and just right on the seasoning.  The burrito app was excellent as well.    I was actually even more impressed with our son's meal: fried popcorn shrimp that he devoured, but I did get to sneak one in and they were delicious.  And it came out fast!  Those of you with a toddler can appreciate this.    Our second time here was on a Friday night.  We had the kid in tow again (he's a restaurant veteran, so no worries).  First off, the vibe of the place at night is great.  Totally want to bring my wife back here again, just the 2 of us, for a date night.  We sat near the bar area, totally chill.  Great service, and again, my son's food came out instantly, so there was no risk of a meltdown.   Then our meals came.   My wife had the shrimp and grits, which tasted great.  Very authentic as well, and as a former southerner, I can speak with some expertise on this.  I wished the shrimp were bigger, but the flavor was there.  I had the redfish entree, and let me tell you, they have some excellent cooking going on in the kitchen.  Great seasoning, and the fish was cooked perfectly.   Overall, I am so happy with this place. Cocktails and wine were also spot on, and service was terrific.  We will certainly be coming back again.",

Though disguised with bushes, Hayden Road is a six lane thoroughfare, less than 20 feet away. Motorcycles, loud muffler pipes, sirens, you name it, we could hardly talk. The menu choices are good, the food was prepared well and delivered promptly. Entrees are all ala-carte. Not sure why, this place just didn't want to give us water to drink along with our beer and wine. Asked once at the bar when ordering our first round, no luck, then at the table had to ask twice. Maybe they don't like doing the dishes. Then they brought a small highball glass with water, no ice, never refilled, and only brought it to two of us. That isn't good service.  Waiter recommended the short ribs with asparagus. It was ok- two small sprigs of asparagus is more decoration than accompaniment. Two of us ordered the baby back ribs- nothing remarkable and neither were the fries. Key lime pie had zero flavor, tasted like it was straight off the Sysco Frozen Foods truck. There are so many other good choices in Scottsdale, so pass. Note to owner: that huge Tea Party flag on the wall by the hostess is absolutely offensive.",

Chop salads can be tough to get right, and Grassroots did a smashing good job if I do say so myself. No wine today, as I had to go back to work after, but it would have been a perfect day for it. Highly recommend!",

Impeccable service down to the tiniest detail, incredible food that makes you salivate at every bite, and an intense atmosphere that makes you feel right at home. Each and everyone of my needs were met, and the host (Jack) greeted me with utmost and genuine respect. Definitely get the Carolina Baby Back Ribs, so good. Also, make sure you inquire about desserts - as they were fantastic. Just woah, I am utterly speechless.",

    "text": "I was happily surprised with Grassroots! For some reason, the name has always made me think it would be a health food restaurant, but it's quite the opposite! It's really more of a hearty and homey restaurant with great BBQ among other hearty items on the menu. We dined here at night and although the summer temps were high, we were still able to enjoy eating on the patio. The atmosphere here is nice and charming. It would be great to come with a couple friends, family or even on a date night. I ended up ordering the chicken salad sandwich which had great flavor and was very hearty. It was on thick bread and came with fries. Every bite was delicious. In addition to the food and atmosphere, the service was excellent as well. I will definitely be back soon to enjoy another meal here.",

Prices are reasonable, food is delicious, atmosphere is fun and modern.  I might make this a regular thing every time I come to town (which is looking like once every 3 months).  Dish ordered was the Spit fire roasted free-range chicken with dirty orzo.  The orzo was amazing.  Lots of flavor and just yum.  Made me really pause to really taste it despite how hungry I was.  The chicken is juicy, tasty and just wow.  You get basically half a chicken minus the wing.  The chicken is served on top of a slice of thick buttered Texas toast.  Until next time!  I can't wait to try something else.",

I would make the trip north for this one.    Started off with the house made salmon.  A very large portion of salmon smoked to perfection.  Really tasty and could be a meal by itself.  Had the burrata which was really yummy.  The tomato jam was super delicious and the arugula salad with the lemon beyond yummy.  Also got to enjoy Dad's grocery bag (love that name!)  this was a nice plate of cheese and meat.  It is a beautiful plate.  I had the sashimi ahi tuna salad and I loved it.  It was really flavorful and the tuna was done perfect.   Nice wine list.  The place has a nice vibe to it.  Go.  You'll thank me later.",

    "text": "Stopped here for some early dinner and a beer, after driving by. Really glad we did- our meal was incredible. It's not a big place, but it has a fun atmosphere, decent sized bar, and lots of patio seating, which is nice starting this time of year. We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and received excellent service throughout the meal. Not a huge beer menu, but definitely a solid selection and good happy hour prices ($4/pint, $10/pitcher).   A smaller menu with excellent choices makes me happy and that's what they offer. We started off with the prosciutto wrapped asparagus- really glad we did that. Grilled just right and drizzled with a sauce that is slightly sweet made it even better.   I got the burger, my husband got the brisket sandwich and we traded halves. Both were very tasty. The actual burger itself was full flavor- my only suggestion was maybe a few less toppings. I like a burger topped with a few things, but this patty had so much flavor that I felt all the toppings almost took away from it.   The brisket sandwich was the big hit of the night. Great flavor in the meat, tender and juicy and enough slaw on top to give it a a nice tang and add texture. The buns on both sandwiches were excellent and high quality.   We had our little one with us and they have a pretty good kids menu, too. It's not listed on the actual menu- the server will rattle it off for you. Ours is a grilled cheese fiend and theirs was great- two kinds of cheese on 9 grain, served with grilled asparagus and fries. We actually asked them to substitute tomatoes for the fries, which they easily accommodated, and she plowed through the hole thing. Minus the asparagus- but that's on her, not Grassroots :)",

My girlfriends ordered the poke something or other, the roasted asparagus and a fish sandwich. I was able to sample all of it and it was amazing. The iced green tea was wonderful too. The place is clean and charming and it seemed like there were servers everywhere. The food came out quickly, drinks were never empty and dishes were cleared promptly.  We sat on the patio which had heaters and wasn't too loud. I'm looking forward to my next visit for date night. I would suggest brighter lights in the bathroom. A girl's gotta check her teeth after a veggie salad. :)",

    "text": "Grassroots is right around the corner and we drive by it every week on our usual Friday-Dinner-Out.  I always assumed it was more of a pub than a restaurant.  My wife and I arrived around 5:00pm and were seated immediately.  The waiter was super attentive and knew the menu and preparation of everything I asked about.    We started with an AMAZING appetizer special of burrata* with ciabatta tips, their house spicy tomato jam and arugula with champagne vinaigrette.  It was described as a sort of an experimental combination of preparations from other dishes.  The burrata was silky smooth and spreads onto the ciabatta like softened cream cheese.  The play of flavors in this dish was excellent, we'd go back here just for this dish alone.  My wife ordered the lobster bisque as her entree, which was smooth and creamy with a good lobster flavor.  I suspect we could have asked for bread on the side, but it didn't come with it by default.  I ordered the short ribs with roasted asparagus and jalapeno cheddar grits.  The ribs were cooked just right, just a little pink and tender with a concentrated glaze of delicious sauce layered on top.  The sauce had a light smoky flavor with a fair amount of saltiness, and appeared to be a long simmered reduction with bold flavor. As others have mentioned, the jalapeno grits are very good, not spicy by any means but a little crunch from the jalapeno pieces, creamy and well prepared.  I strongly recommend the short ribs to anyone.  We splurged with dessert of key lime pie and a banana split.  The split included three large scoops of (what appeared to be) homemade ice cream and topped with caramelized pecans.  The key lime was tart and delicious.  The portion sizes were perfect and considering the careful preparation and unique flavors the price was appropriate.  It's a little more expensive that I would like to put Grassroots into our weekly rotation, but I look forward to visiting it again and sample more items off the menu when the budget allows.  * I didn't know what burrata was: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBurrata&s=bf5062766985c401825ad585ca2133f023ddfa79304381c20d7420bb152a3739\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bu...</a>",

I got a manhattan which was served with one large ice cube and mixed to perfection. My wife had the Moscow Bull which is a Moscow Mule served with Red Bull and she liked it.  For my meal I ordered the fliet which was cooked exactly how I requested and hit the spot. I had the large asparagus with it which was very good. Wife got the Waldorf Chicken Salad and she enjoyed it. I have a large appetite and she didn't quite finish it so I tried some and I was blown away by how good it was. The mustard-honey yogurt dressing was incredible.  I would highly recommend this place for a nice dinner.",

We arrived during \"Social Hour\" (their take on Happy Hour), and our table ordered the brisket sliders and a Piggly Wiggly appetizer platter (baby back ribs, prosciutto-wrapped asparagus, and pork belly). The ribs were the highlight of the latter - fall off the bone tender and very flavorful. The sauce was a bit spicy and not too sweet. Our friends enjoyed their brisket sliders, commenting that they would definitely order them again. Our friends had the \"Roti & Rib Combo\", and echoed our thoughts on the deliciousness of the ribs. We had the shrimp & grits, very tasty and spicy - but we wished that the grits had been a bit creamier. Dessert (which we almost never order) was wonderful - our friends shared a piece of key lime pie that they said was excellent, and we shared a HUGE chocolate toffee brownie topped with Sweet P's wonderful vanilla ice cream. The brownie was sweet but delicious when paired with the ice cream.   We will be back to further explore the menu, and while mulling over our next choices we'll be sure to enjoy a craft beer or two...they have a very nice selection on draft.",

I noticed the same thing at neighboring tables.",

The next app was wings.  Complete fail on that.  Free range chicken that was over fried... the sauce was a fail too but you get a bottle of hot sauce on the table which was great.    Got the ahi tuna salad.  Smartly done and even comes served in chilled plate.  Excellent.  Please use more fresh lettuce as it was browning and the sauce was too much but the hot sauce actually cut it well.  Overall satisfied.   Great ambience and servers were great.  Highly recommend you stop by and get a healthy sampling.  I'll come back for sure.",

    "text": "We have been to this restaurant several times in the past receiving a not so warm reception. Service has consistently been slow but we thought we would give it one more try at lunch.   We entered the restaurant and the hostess was sitting at a table and munching on something. She did come over and take us to a table. We sat there for a good 20 minutes while wait staff were either bussing a table or talking. We did notice one waitress was waiting on a table on the outside patio.   Finally, we decided this wasn't working. We rose and there was another hostess? at the hostess station and a wait staff? girl as we walked by, I looked at both of them and said, \"We are leaving, we can't get waited on.\"  They looked at both myself and my husband with a discerning look like who cares. I immediately called Wally's Restaurant knowing who owned Grassroots, along with several other restaurants in his possession. I decided to call them because obviously there was no credible manager at Grassroots that day since it appeared no one was interested in our business. I left a message for the owner to call me and have never heard a word back.   What a shame that this establishment could care less about their customers. Since we are business owners, we thought they would be interested in our experience. Guess not.   Too many other great restaurants in the valley to choose from. Good luck. We won't return. Ever.",

Rarely do you run into a restaurant who doesn't overcook the pork chop. I found their thick cut pork chop to be extremely juicy and have a very nice smoky flavor. I have tried the majority of items on their menu and have found them to all be extremely flavorful and worth the money. I have yet to be disappointed by any visit.",

I also like the decor, some of the art on the walls was absolutely gorgeous and the ambient music is good (we heard Metallica playing!)  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table which was fine since the place was packed; we came in right around the end of their happy hour.  If you want to go here on a Friday night make a reservation!  They also do one of my biggest pet peeves.  They have a really nice outdoor seating area but they don't serve food out there!  I really hate restaurants that do that.  I was a little surprised by the crowd at the restaurant since it seemed really trendy.  My husband and I are in our early thirties, there was one other couple around our age and the rest of the patrons were 50-80.  Our waitress was nice but I wouldn't call her above average in any way.  We started off with the Poke appetizer.  It was alright, the tuna was really fresh and the shrimp were cooked perfectly but I felt it was lacking flavor.  I used the half lime they served it with liberally and my husband doused his portion in hot sauce.  I also didn't like the wontons they served it with.  They were so hard it cut my gum!  My husband ordered the mixed BBQ plate which our waitress told us was \"huge.\"  It was not huge; it was a small chicken breast and maybe 5-6 bones worth of ribs.  The chicken skin tasted heavily of cinnamon so my husband pulled it off.  The chicken was well cooked but pretty flavorless, he doused that in hot sauce too.  The ribs weren't bad but they were average.  The coleslaw was an Asian slaw which was nice and I think the baked beans were the star of the evening.  They were probably the best baked beans I'd ever had and a big reason why this review is 3 stars instead of 2.  For $24 we both expected a lot more!  I got the braised short ribs.  It was 2 small pieces of short rib.  They were cooked nicely, they fell apart when I stuck my fork in them and the sauce was flavorful.  It was served with 2 asparagus spears and the jalapeno cheddar grits.  I am very sensitive when it comes to heat and the grits had no spice to them at all.  It tasted like green peppers instead of jalapenos and lacked flavor in general.    We had the appetizer, two entrees, my husband had a beverage with alcohol and I had a soda.  Our bill was $74, $90 with tip.  If it had been cheaper I might consider going back.  It was definitely not worth that much money for the amount of food we got and how it tasted!  Their cooking technique is spot on, but the flavor of all the food we got was seriously lacking.  I'm glad we went so we could check it out but we won't be back.",

However when looking more closely I realized that gratuity was added. I don't have a problem with auto grat but I had a problem with not being told it had been added. Some people didn't notice and double tipped which was not their intention. I mentioned it to the people on my side who appreciated the heads-up. I realize this may not be the restaurant's intention but the server's but I do find it a shady practice when this happens.",

I live in Tempe but was in the area this evening and I thought it was the perfect opportunity to visit Grassroots. My 9 year old son was with me. I ordered a glass of Chardonnay  ($7 on Happy Hour - GOOD wine). My son had their delicious green iced tea. Andrea was our server and I did see Chris making the rounds with the tables (The Collins boys are great at making people feel welcome-great sense of humor). I had the blackened fish sandwich, but asked for it on the flaxseed bun as opposed to the artisan bun (no problem), my son had a big caesar salad (he loves caesar salad). Everything was delicious as always. We sat on the patio and the weather and service were perfect. Good job Chris! Can't wait to try Twisted Grove next door.",

My husband found this restaurant on Yelp and other apps looking for a place to eat close by our hotel.  This place did not disappoint.  The bartenders were great.  Didn't really care for their margarita as it had too much lime juice but my husband enjoyed his beer!  Our dinner was very delicious.  I had the smoked brisket sandwich (with the coleslaw on the side and not on it) with the shoestring fries.  My husband had the chicken Waldorf salad.  We had the key lime pie for dessert.  The piece of pie was just right for sharing.  I don't think we could have both had one.  Our waitress, Janelle, was awesome--very friendly and provided great service.  We would definitely recommend this place.  It has an outside patio and the inside is very casual but nice.  Give it a try!",

The appetizer order somehow did not go through the computer to the chef so the manager came to our table right away to let us know what happened.  He also made it right by giving us the appetizer for free.  That is something all restaurants should take note of.  They admitted right away they made a mistake (really I think it was the computer), they came right over to let us know and gave us the appetizer for free...that's how you treat customers!

The size was just perfect to hit the right spot of hearty yet overwhelmingly Buffet size portion. It is phenomenal. It's flavorful with the right balance of dimension of both slow roasted veggies and crisp cuts of fresh beets. I would want it a tad bit spicer but I'm sure it can be requested. I highly recommend that you not leave without having the sashimi ahi salad, a tall pint of the Michigan Celis White beer and the heavenly key lime pie. There's something about the whipped cream that is so nutty and the hand squeezed key lime is just simply perfection in a slice! I will warn that service gets overwhelmed during rush hour so anticipate a long lunch hour :)",

The only negative I could ever say is that the inside dining area is only of adequate size and the outside patio is close to Hayden Rd and can be noisy.  This isn't a fancy/expensive steak or seafood house, just a great local spot that has ALWAYS had delicious food and wonderful, friendly service at moderate prices.   The jalapeno chedder grits side dish is superb, the pork chop that I often order is delicious, as all the main entrees that I've ordered have always been.  Try the fish sandwich - broiled or blackened - served with a different fish each day.  A favorite spot of ours for either lunch or dinner.",

We started off with the poke.  When it came it looked interesting but it was aweful.  The fish tasted water logged from being frozen and then defrosted. The flavor overall  was really bland.  The fish wasnt even fresh.  Come on now.  It you are going to serve raw fish lets make it fresh please.  The wonton chips tasted like they came out of the bag and even tasted a bit stale.   I had the vegetable plate.  On the menu they said these were local farm fresh vegetables.  Terrible.  The tomato was hard as a rock and the basil on top was all shriviled like it had been old.  The swiss chard and the asparagus were ok, but nothing special. Very oily... The corn tasted like it was frozen corn with cheese in it.  yuck.  The craziset thing was that there was a huge huge pile of coldslaw that dominated the plate.  What is that even doing on there? My husband had the shrimp poboy and again it was ok but the shrimp tasted frozen and just fried.  My son had the corn dog and loved it.  At least someone liked their meal.  This place really needs to rethink its \"farm to table\" concept because they are really not living up to that statement.",

The ambiance is perfect - it is relaxed, with an intimate feel to the place without being overly stuffy. It has a full bar in the middle of the restaurant and appears to have roll-up garage doors on one side of the restaurant for nice days. There are also community tables with game boards in the table (I only saw checkers but there may be other games).  In short, the food was phenomenal, which I expected based on my love for Wally's. I ordered the Roti and Ribs entree, which includes some ribs and part of a rotisserie chicken. It comes with Grassroots' cole slaw, which is not to be missed. The slaw has a slight Asian twist to it that is really delicious. It also comes with a side of beans - loaded with bacon of course. I also ordered a side of the shoestring potatoes. Everything was fabulous. Others in my party ordered burgers and the short ribs and they loved their food as well but my Roti and Ribs platter stole the show. I can't recommend that entree enough - it was absolutely delicious!  The staff was awesome, the service was awesome, the ambiance was awesome and most importantly the food was awesome. I will definitely be returning to Grassroots Kitchen & Tap sometime soon!",

McCormick Ranch is lucky to have Grassroots here! I read an earlier post that received a one star rating, which could not be farther from the truth! the owner prides himself on making sure the patrons have a pleasurable dining experience. They have a great bar to gather at, but they do not and will NOT tolerate drunken and obnoxious behavior.  I appreciate this, because as someone who enjoys having a great meal and drink, I do not appreciate sloppy and loud drunk people around me ruining my dining experience.",

He stated the owner's are working on getting another unit. It was actually cooler outside (108 degrees) with misters then inside. No apology, just is what it is.  I'll go back with client's again AFTER they resolve the AC issue.",

Not too long of a wait but luckily we were able to be casual and post up at the bar and enjoy some cocktails and dinner there.  I had the Pulled Pork Sandwich.  Highly recommend it here.  Service was timely and the atmosphere was a True \"neighborhood\" feeling.  My minor complaint that would have made this a 5 star was the temperature of the food (at least mine.)  With that being said, I was very impressed and look forward to returning soon!",

Not only was the food very good (we had the beef short ribs, shrimp & grits and some fish) but the dining experience was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive and really seemed to care that we enjoyed our time there, continually checking on us while refreshing drinks and offering suggestions; he acted more like an owner than just an employee. There was a small wait for our entrees to come out, no big deal (I've waited FAR longer for food) and the waiter profusely apologized. When he brought us the desert menu, we were told that the manager was buying us a round of deserts because of the delay (and they were awesome btw -- get the key lime pie!) They didn't have to do that, but it was nice that they really cared and went above and beyond to make us happy. I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town :)",

Seems like so many restaurants are hit or miss - great one time, disappointing the next - but we've been to Grassroots probably eight times since we first discovered it six months ago and  have thoroughly enjoyed it every time.    Love the Angus burgers (cooked perfectly, with killer fries), the chopped salad, the brisket, the chicken walnut salad sandwich, the salmon/salad combo, Dad's Grocery Bag (perfectly sized appetizer with a variety of cured meats, cheeses, olives, nuts, and bread - paired with a glass of wine, I've died and gone to heaven!).   I'm sure we'll get more adventurous and try more menu items in the future but we've so enjoyed the aforementioned items that we seem to keep ordering the same thing.  Have also over-indulged a couple times by sharing the banana split afterwards.... not doing the waist-line any favors but decadent as an occasional treat : )   Totally agree with another post regarding the amazing renovation of the space - ate here when it was a Chinese restaurant, and an Italian one before that, and it's unrecognizable as the same place.   Very pleasant and relaxing ambiance, both inside and out on the patio.",

    "text": "My friend and I went  here today for lunch and ended up leaving in the middle of the meal because of a horrifically rude, nasty, disrespectful encounter I had with the OWNER of this establishment. We ordered the vegetable chopped salad and about 4 bites in I noticed a curly blonde hair laying on a red beet. Obviously I lost my appetite and kindly called over the server. I completely understand that once in a horrible while a 'hair' can happen. My appetite was lost but I was not mad. My horrific experience ensued when I asked to speak to a manager and the owner came over. He immediately greeted me with a cocky and rude demeanor. He didn't apologize at all;  instead took the defense stating that it was a 'corn husk' not a hair. He then disrespectfully accused me of giving him mixed signals about whether or not I wanted more food or had lost my appetite. I was mortified and disgusted to be spoken to and treated this way by the OWNER of Grass Roots. I immediately got up to excuse myself from this hideous situation and in doing so he continued to follow me out shouting \"Thank You, Thank You\" in his obviously comfortable sarcastic tone. Instead of taking the HIGH Road and potentially creating a customer for life by doing damage control; apologizing and acknowledging Grass Roots' error, (which is truly all I ever wanted him to do) he continued in a verbal sparring session with me. I will NEVER step foot back in Grass Roots. The food was mediocre but the service was hideous! As a customer who is well versed in dining all over the Valley I was excited to try a new place close to home, I left feeling appalled and dismayed.",

The main courses were so lackluster, so downright bad, that I'm baffled as to this restaurant's rating.  -Shrimp and grits- Tiny, cooked to rubber, over-seasoned shrimp atop grits that were so thick, so dry, it felt like spackling paste. Served with a very large portion of focaccia. Wrong choice here, as the grits would be the starch you'd sop up any sauce with. If there was any sauce. There was not.  -Po' boy- Again with the tiny shrimp, think frozen salad shrimp. Bread? Meh. How a 7-11 would mass produce a southern sandwich.  -side dishes- The baked beans were a tasty, and meaty option. The chard should really just be billed as spinach here. One leaf of chard, possibly two. Tasty nonetheless.  I love southern food, from crisp fried hush puppies to blackened fish. Beignets to crawfish pie. Our visit was uninspired. I couldn't be convinced to return.",

They also have take out available - which I totally did within a few days to just have more of that artichoke. They can seat large groups because of the open atmosphere.

I go there all the time and recently a hostess named Angie provided \"0\" restaurant etiquitte and NO I cannot attitude. This last time I went in with my 94yr. old Mom and a very good friend visiting carrying full time portable oxygen. With 5 tables available she said we had to wait. Not a problem.....but  a lady in front of us in the bathroom came out and was seated without the rest of her party for a good 15min. We were never offered seating to wait until I said something. I then went next door to the sister property and they had availability.When I went to get my guests, they were getting ready to seat my ppl. in a booth that my Mom who was in a walker had to climb up into and my friend with oxygen had to climb as well and slide around. What would you think. On top of it this young sassy hostess was rude and certainly did NOT know how to handle  ADA compliant guest(s) Someone needs to teach her and some of the wait staff procedures. I have been a meeting planner and F/B person for 20+ years. We were very glad to go next door, have a great seat, super hostess that was totally on it and and an excellent waitress. I am not a complainer knowing this business very well. I just was compelled as this put me over the top with the crappy attitude some staffing can have. She was more concerned with her short outfit pulling it down as she walked than she was accommodating loyal repeat guests. You will not see me there for a long time and will surely not bring my Corporate Group Business either. .........Train staff!!!",

He appeared shortly after we were seated and got our drink and dinner order in a very timely manner.  His description of my Wednesday special Grassroot's Gumbo was right one when he said hearty; I'm sure glad I only got a cup because it was so packed with meat (chicken, pork and sausage)!  And it tasted delicious.  For our main course my wife got the salmon and I had the blackened red fish. Both dishes were very tasty and the portions were excellent in size.  Adam and other service staff kept our water glasses filled at all times.  For dessert we split their well-known coconut cream pie, another recommendation I can make for both taste and portion size.  As we were talking with Adam towards the end of our visit, we asked about other recommendations he might have for our next visit considering he was so helpful so far.  He said we should come hungry for short ribs or the baby back ribs next time.  And so we shall.",

I mention this to my server every time I eat at a restaurant.  After the first visit, we were so impressed that we raved about the outstanding food, ambience, and service for our late lunch. I ordered the Scottish salmon and salad, with a side of asparagus. I mentioned my soy issue and was reassured there was no soy in my meal, which was perfectly prepared and delicious.  We returned the second day for an early lunch, and this time I ordered the fish sandwich and a side of asparagus. I mentioned the soy sensitivity and my server double checked to make sure my meal was soy free. When the food came, I noticed the sauces and asked the server to check again, as they may have soy in them. Again I was reassured there was no soy.   I ate my sandwich and immediately fell ill with the painful stomach cramps, gas, bloating, and diarrhea that are  the unmistakable tell-tale signs that I have, in fact, ingested soy. I rushed to the bathroom doubled over with pain. My son was left to tell the server I had fallen ill, and she said, \"I'm sorry to hear that,\" and dropped off the bill. My son had to ask her to remove my meal from the bill, given their mistake. Then they told my son the bread in my sandwich contained soy. I would be shocked if there was not more soy in the meal I ate than just the bread, given how terribly ill I was for the next six hours. Even now, after 18 hours, my intestines are raw and sore. Not the kind of experience I ever want to repeat, so we will not be back to this restaurant.  This kind of mistake, in this day and age, is inexcusable, and the chef was irresponsible to the point of negligence. I hope they get their act together before their lack of care results in something even more tragic befalling a customer who unwittingly consumes food causing a poor reaction after being reassured it is safe.",

    "text": "We happened upon this place through Yelp. What a great find! Our dinner was outstanding. I had the Rosti and Ribs combo and my lady had the Farmers Vegetable Chop salad. They have an excellent beer selection and their desserts were killer - key lime pie and coconut cream pie. Our waiter, Marina Joy, was a delight and was always available for our every need.  One of the services we enjoyed was that every employee in the restaurant offered service to you even if you were not at their table. If you needed a drink refill or a dirty plate removed, a waiter took care of you. I had the opportunity to visit with the owner a bit and was impressed with his restaurant experience and customer service attitude. He also owns the nearby Twisted Grove Parlor. If we lived in the area, this would be near the top of our go-to places.",

For our appetizer we had lobster bisque which was good. For dinner we had the rotisserie chicken, rock fish and a side of shoestring fries. All meals, sides were delicious and beers on tap were great. Our waitress could not have been more pleasant and helpful our entire time. All around great experience and will happily visit this restaurant again. Highly recommend to all looking for a good meal in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area.",

We started with the Ahi salad it was solid not the best I've had but really good nonetheless. Our entree was a delicious shrimp and grits dish that had plump, juicy shrimps and buttery grits, I would order this again. For dessert we shared the key lime pie slice. I love key lime pie and this was a pretty good one. My son enjoyed a giant root beer float topped with a black cherry and rich whipped cream. He loved it!  We need to return to try other dishes on their extensive menu! Another 5 star spot for us.",

For the meal I opted for the daily special of grilled tuna steak with a tasty herb butter and steamed cauliflower with a honey mustard vinaigrette topped with golden raisins and nuts. Soooo satisfying. The wine list isn't extensive but definitely offers something for everyone.",

The waiter that we had, Jack, was very personable as well as accommodating, pleasant and helpful. When I had an issue with my entree he immediately notified the manager. She offered to replace it and give me something else and took it off of the bill. They then gave us a free dessert. The food couldn't have been better with the exception of my scallops which it was only because of a personal dislike of certain spices. Otherwise the loaded baked potato was wonderful as was the bread served and everyone else's entrees were to their liking. I would highly suggest this restaurant with it's American fare.

    "text": "I love Grassroots - their Happy Hour is great. The HH menu is short, but the flavor is PHENOMENAL! And it's a good bargain. The burrata is excellent, I highly recommend it. So are the sliders - Hawaiian sweet roll sliders with slow-roasted brisket. The homemade pickle on the slider makes it worth dreaming of.   The bar is very large - a U-shape, and well stocked. I always order wine, so can't speak to any cocktails or beer they serve. But I always find a glass of wine I like and want, and they don't forget me when my glass is empty. :-)  Off the HH menu, my fav dish is the bbq brisket plate with grits, pickles, baked beans and cornbread. I'm from the South, and have been extremely disappointed in what some restaurants call cornbread, or even biscuits, for that matter. But Grassroots' cornbread is very good.  The service is always good/above average - I've never felt like I was forgotten or overlooked. And the waitstaff personalities are collectively warm and accommodating.   This has a neighborhood restaurant feel to it - there's nothing luxurious about it like eating at our resort restaurants, but it's not supposed to be. It's excellent in giving you comfort food in a modern, open, airy, and lively atmosphere.  Because it's open & airy, it isn't a restaurant to go with a book - it's a bit loud.   There is also good patio seating!",

I've actually been before for happy hour and lunch and totally spaced a review, so this is all encompassing! :)   Specifically last night, our server was SO friendly, attentive, and knowledgable about the restaurant and entire restaurant group as a whole. {They also own Twisted Grove!}. We started with the Burrata appetizer which is a MUST. They serve it with toasted bread, spicy tomato jam, and arugula with a zesty lemon dressing. I've had this before and now have to get it every time that I come! My friend and I split the farmer's vegetable chopped salad to start and holy salad heaven. It was cold, crisp, and packed with every veggie under the sun! Off the top of my head, I know that it had beets, edamame, feta, cucumber, squash, radishes, tomatoes, scallions, herbs, and more! I could live on this salad!  For my entree, I got the short ribs with jalapeno cheddar grits and my oh my it was HEAVEN. The short ribs fell apart and basically melted in my mouth.   This is a place that you must try - you won't be disappointed!!",

The wife had the grilled miso glazed salmon and said it was off the hook. No pun intended. I had the chicken and rib plate with beans and Cole slaw. Damn that was good. Chicken was seasoned beautifully and the ribs were fall off the bone tender. The star was the oh so good slaw. Crunchy, tangy, and sweet. Perfectly dressed. Finished the evening off with the warm brownie with ice cream. It was drizzled in Carmel and sprinkled with toffee. Duhamm We were also fortunate to have Jess as our server. She was the best.",

However, the braised short ribs were so tough you couldnt eat it. What made matters worse, was the service.  Our server had NO personality and acted like we were an imposition when we asked for anything. I was so disappointed with my experience.  Time to explore other options.

Four double squares of foccacia bread each held  a tiny dab of portobello and tomato and this at the recommendation of the bartender. No one ever asked how it was. If so, I would have said this is not what I thought it was and it's basically an order of foccacia. No one ever refilled our drinks either. What's going on, Grassroots? This is not a good choice for a vegan or vegetarian. My husband said that it was pitiful.",

Our waiter was friendly and very patient with our large group.  I have to give him kudos for his positive attitude and professionalism.  For appetizers, we shared the pork belly.  It has six large pieces accompanied with crusty bread and a great spicy tomato jam.  I really liked this.  My friend had the Dad's Grocery bag and they must of liked it cause it was gone pretty fast.  For entrees, our waiter recommended the Root's BBQ Brisket.  It came with five thick slices of brisket (doesn't look like your typical BBQ beef brisket) but it was very tender and moist.  The BBQ sauce was good as well as the cheddar grits.  My other friends enjoyed their entrees as well.   They had a pretty good selection of draft beers.  I would definitely come back here.",

We made reservations (highly recommend) as they were packed on a weeknight. We decided to go with the short ribs and the special which was a sea bass. The sea bass was my absolute favorite. We got the last one, so they really do value freshness. It was served with roasted cauliflower. So Good! We also had prosciutto wrapped asaparagus. I highly recommend. I would eat this over and over and over and over again (get my point!?). The short ribs were amazing, melt in your mouth, and we had ours with fries and the fries were on point and absolutely delicious.  I also enjoyed some house Pinot with my meal. It was amazing. LOVE LOVE LOVE. Would definitely vitsit here. Great ambience, excellent service.",

Service highlighted by our fabulous server Michelle, who REALLY likes food and wanted us to have a great experience there. On her recommendation, started with the smoked salmon, which she brought focaccio and a side of cucumbers to  accompany--every bite was delicious! For the mains, we have scallops special on a bed of jalapeno grits and the chicken and ribs combo. Again, both dishes knocked it out of the park! Baked beans with pork belly too good! Michelle brought extra BBQ sauce, which was the best I have ever had. Wish we had room for dessert! I will be back the next time I am in PHOE! Run, don't walk to this place!",

    "text": "Grassroots bills itself as a modern elegant twist on southern cuisine.  From a decor and menu perspective, it hits on both notes.  Unfortunately, it misses badly on the food.  My wife ordered a salad with very lightly seared Ahi tuna.  While it looked great on paper, she found it relatively tasteless.  The tuna wasn't seasoned and the salad included goat cheese, radishes and field greens.  She indicated that since this was a special order, I shouldn't put too much weight on her dish.    One of our dinner guests ordered the poki appetizer.  I prefer poki to be lightly seasoned and leaning towards a citrus flavor.  This was sweet (IMO too sweet) and not particularly inspired.   My wife and I both agreed that we have had better at local fast food poki bars.  I ordered the lobster bisque appetizer and the shrimp and grits entree.  Unfortunately, both fell flat.  While the bisque was creamy and nicely seasoned, it didn't have that velvet feeling of a perfect bisque.  It was also missing any hint of lobster.  I know there are schools of thought that say you shouldn't have pieces of the protein in a bisque, I personally consider it a cardinal sin.    Another of our dinner guests ordered the short ribs.  I thought the rib was tasty but if I had to guess, it would have needed another couple of hours in the slow cooker.  It just wasn't sufficient tender.  My entree was the True disappointment of the evening.  For perspective, I love love love good grits.  I consider them the poor man's risotto.  They need to be cooked for the right amount of time and served immediately after cooking.  If you wait, they turn into a mushy paste.  That's where this dish started.  I never leave over grits and this time, I couldn't get past a few bits.  The dish actually went down hill from there.  The shrimp, which should have been the star of the show, were overcooked salt bombs.  I hungry enough to finish them but I'd never try them again nor would I recommend them.  This is not a particularly complex dish but it does require some care and timing. Neither was apparent last night.  Overall, the atmosphere is good and the service was solid. But the real reason you go to a restaurant is the food and Grassroots just didn't cut it last night.",

It came on a ceramic plate that had separations for her two sides, a sauce and than a big space for her main entree. My daughter asked for asparagus ( which was perfectly cut for a small child), the grapes (which she also chose) was cut in half!!!! Which again, is ideal for a small child. Than the chicken tenders were in the main one. At the end of the meal, her meal came with a treat- which was a free ice cream next door! They also have only two-three desserts to not compete with the ice cream shop next door- now amazing is that?!? Pretty nice business etiquette. We can't say anything negative, except...WHEN ARE YOU COMING TO SAN FRAN?!? :)",

I started with the prosciutto wrapped asparagus followed by the filet mignon and tipped it all of with the roofer brownie to go!  The asparagus had the perfect tenderness where it still had a crunch to the bite but was not chewy.  It was the perfect salt and sweet combination with the prosciutto and honey.  The addition of the sea salt on my filet was killer.  No additions needed and the temperature was spot on.  The Brandy-7 was tasty as well ;)  Top notch, well done Chef Christopher!",

The best I've ever tasted. It left me wanting more. For my entree I had the blackened red fish with a dirty orzo. The fish was cooked perfectly. My friends had the braised short ribs with jalapeno grits. The grits were smooth and creamy and no spicy at all. The short ribs were in a delicious gravy. We also had at out table the chicken sandwich and the shredded short rib sandwich which my friends said was also delicious. To top off the meal we had the brownie with toffee pieces and a caramel drizzle with a scope of vanilla ice cream that we shared. What a perfectly delicious meal. I very highly recommend Grassroots.

    "text": "I went to Grassroots Kitchen & Tap for dinner with a friend this week because we wanted to try something a little different, and after looking at the menu, I decided to give this place a try.  It's located next to one of my favorite coffee shops (The Village Roastery), and has a beautiful heated patio which is where we sat. The restaurant itself if very nice; it has a great ambiance to it.   I ordered a Kona beer, the shrimp poboy, and jalapeno & cheese grits. Hooooly crap, I kid you not, I think I could die in a vat of those grits. They were heavenly! You wouldn't expect a Grassroots to have such a southern/creole vibe to it, but it totally works.   Our waitress was very sweet, service was prompt and friendly. The only drawback is that the prices are a little high, but you do get large portions. It would be really fun to come for their social hour with a group of friends.",

    "text": "The first thing you notice is that this place has a nice atmosphere - modern country chic.  I had been to the restaurant that previously occupied the space and it's unrecognizable.    The service is above average starting when the hostess opened the door as we approached.  They are very pleasant and solicitous without being overbearing.  I drink a lot of water and they were all over it.  Most diners were in shorts and tee-shirts, even workout clothing, but the staff treated us like we were out for a very fine meal.    And it was a very fine meal.  My husband and I weren't overly hungry so we split the portobello sandwich.  It was delicious - the mushroom was thick and tender, the other ingredients complimented it beautifully, and the focaccia bread was brushed with sea salt.  Our side, the loaded potato, was enormous and baked to perfection.  It was a great portion, so we didn't have room to try the desserts, though they sounded great.  We saw many things on the menu that we wanted to try, so less than a week later, I went over to pick up some take-out.  We ordered the tuna sandwich and the vegetable plate (and two of those excellent potatoes - my sandwich came with one, and we bought another to accompany the veggies).  I eat a lot of seared tuna - it's my go-to order at just about any restaurant, all over the valley and in travels worldwide.  This was one of the top 3 tuna sandwiches I have ever had.  The fish was cooked perfectly and the cajun flavor complemented it without overpowering it.  I was incredibly impressed.  The vegetables were lovely, as well, though I suspect my husband found cabbage and chard (the seasonal vegetables) to be a little unusual - he absolutely loved the asparagus and tomatoes, though.  Our baked potatoes were amazing, again.  Since then, we've been back many times, and everything we've tried has been well-executed and delicious.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that it's a little pricey - the quality is absolutely superior, but a $15 tuna sandwich ($16 with avocado) is just a hair above reasonable.",

    "text": "What a surprise!  This place is pretty darn good.  When a colleague called me up to go to lunch and said \"hey, let's go to Grassroots\", my immediate response was \"dude, that's not one of those healthy vegan places is it? because I don't like those kind of restaurants\".....he laughed and said \"trust me, this is your kind of place\".....he was right.  We met around 11:30 am for lunch and the parking lot in the shopping center it's in was jam packed.  When it's mid-day in Arizona, the last thing you want to do is park far away from the restaurant and walk in dress clothes to/from your car....it's too hot.  In this case, I had to park really far away in the parking garage.  The parking situation gets 1 Star.  The food and service on the other hand gets a solid 4 Stars.  I decided to go with the Smoked BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich w/Fries, $13. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grassroots-kitchen-and-tap-scottsdale?select=Fd9b4bUF72Anw5bE3sFiZA#Fd9b4bUF72Anw5bE3sFiZA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gras...</a>  I immediately fell in love with the Sandwich after 1 bite.  The Cole Slaw that was put on top of the Brisket was the perfect compliment....this thing is full of flavor.  However, it was messy...I don't recommend it for a business lunch.....I am trying to stop ordering messy menu items during business lunches, but for some reason I can't stop.  Good thing I didn't get any on me.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  Despite the joint being packed for lunch and crazy busy, she was able to ensure we were well taken care of.  Tip - Ask for a table away from the front door.  There are several tables near the front door and we sat at one of them.  Since it's so busy, there are 2 things about those tables that are bad....the constant opening of the door lets in the 400 degree convection oven air from the Sonoran Desert and it's very hard to stay cool....the other thing is that when people wait for their table, they're almost on top of you.  That said, next visit we'll sit in the back.  Return Factor - 85%",

I have been to both locations and the experience and quality is equal. I have also tried the ahi tuna burger as well as the ribs and they are both superb. The key lime pie dessert is making my mouth drool just thinking of it! Whenever I have family or meet someone from out of town I always tell them to check this place out! Can't wait to try their new ice cream place they're building next door!",

The bowl probably was enough for lunch, but I needed an order of their jalapeno cheese grits which may be the world's best.   Excellent food, excellent service. We continue to enjoy this restaurant every trip to Scottsdale!",

I might go back sometime to have a glass of wine, but I'm not interested in going back for dinner.",

I think I have tasted almost everything on the menu and it all rocks.  I really dig the short ribs, and the jalapeno cheddar grits, and the tuna app.  Update - 10/4/2013.  I had to change my rating from 5 stars to 3.  I have been back several times since my 1st post and I have to say that the service is going down hill.  Don't get me wrong, the food is great, but bad service kind of jacks it all up.  I don't care how f'n good the food is.  Last night my wife and I had the most unaccommodating server ever.  Won't split a salad in the kitchen (because they don't do that), and would not leave a mason jar of water at our table because it is needed for other tables. How hard would it be to get another jar of water from the kitchen?  My wife is preggers so we are not drinking any alcohol.  I feel like we were treated like crap.  There are a ton of restaurants that I can give my business to.  The food might not be as good, but the service won't leave a bad taste in my mouth (I like that sentence).  On a positive note, my wife had the short rib and I had the brisket and they were both awesome.  Too bad the service sucked.",

I had the portabella sandwich on ciabatta bread. It was delicious and I loved that it was cut in four smaller pieces. There were a number of sides I could have chosen but I went with the french fries, which were thin, crispy and well seasoned with a slight kick to them. The pork chop was thick but well cooked and juicy. It comes with a fairly tasty spinach salad. For dessert, I highly recommend the Key Lime pie. Our waiter said it is something they are known for and I can see why. Some of the best Key Lime pie I have ever had! The slice was a good size and just the right amount of sour, tangy and sweet! Overall a great new find!",

We ordered key lime pie, but did not like it so the waiter took it off the bill. On a positive note, the server was very knowledgeable and friendly; he seemed to like working at this place.

A little on the higher end of price range, but nothing at all unreasonable for the quality of food. I always love when things are locally sourced as well, makes the eating feel so much cleaner.",
