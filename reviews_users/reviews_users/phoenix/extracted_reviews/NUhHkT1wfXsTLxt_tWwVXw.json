The last few times we've been there, we've walked in and waited by the door for some time before someone came over to seat us. After being seated, we've had to wait for quite a while to get our drinks and order. As far as the food goes - their Thai tea is really good as is the cashew chicken, pad thai, & panang curry. If you're going in to eat, just be aware that it will be a while until you get your food!",

Just got the Panang with chicken & sweet and sour chicken, both unbelievably good. My cousin is from Thailand and makes obviously the best Thai food, so normally I'm disappointed when I get Thai in the states from different restaurants, but not this place! Honestly, they have high quality, authentic Thai food, made exactly how it should be. I will definitely be ordering again soon.",

    "text": "When my partner and I first moved to Tempe, we went on a legitimate hunt for the best Thai food. Over a period of several weeks, we strategically visited every Thai food restaurant in the area, extending as far west as Phoenix, as far east as Mesa, as far north as North Scottsdale, and as far south as Chandler.  She and I lucked out, because our final pick for Top Spot was an easy winner not 10 minutes away from where we lived in North Tempe: Thai Elephant.  We loved Thai Elephant for every part of the experience we could expect from eating there. Very nice interior ambiance, very polite staff, extensive menu with tons of delicious options, very fair prices, fast service, and easy take-out options.  Thai Elephant has been my go-to Thai food restaurant for more than a year now and I've never grown weary of it. I've also never tired of their Chicken Panang Curry! Wow. THE best I've had. So creamy and consistently delicious.  Portion sizes are more than adequate, too. We got in the habit of ordering two dinner portions of the Chicken Panang Curry because we knew it would last us a total of four meals (two for each of us). Even the rice is usually done right here.  If you haven't been to Thai Elephant, you'll find it veritably surrounded by other Thai food restaurants (there are multiple within a 1/2-mile of Thai Elephant), but don't be distracted! Go to Thai Elephant and enjoy some of the best Thai food you've ever eaten!  Thank you, Thai Elephant, for providing such delicious food at such fair prices, for always being so polite and enthusiastic to serve. I'll see you again VERY soon. (Can't help it: I'm addicted to your Panang Curry...)     ;)",

My duck came under a piece of cut skin with no fat lining. Under the skin that may have been duck skin were bits a pieces of dry old duck meat. It really looked like some leftover. Parts were so old and hard that I couldn't eat them. I felt too embarrassed to say anything to the waitress who seemed uncomfortable with too much English. I can't believe that I ate half my serving before it was totally clear that I was fed scraps. Maybe from someone else's plate. Two servers helped me and they served my two appetizers then before I was even 1/4 of the way done, they brought the old duck scraps on spinach. I wish I hadn't been so polite because now I am having flashbacks that make me even more afraid that I are someone's else's leftover duck. The spring rolls were very good but the peanut sauce was dull. The calamari was great. Overall I feel trauma over the expensive duck entree that looked and tasted like garbage.",

However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was even better. Very tasty and rich, and didn't skimp as much as other places on the meat portion. I really hope that it wasn't just a one time thing and that the quality is consistent every time because I'm definitely planning on coming back. Not exactly inexpensive, but if the quality and portions stay solid it will be worth it. The only complain is that our server didn't split the check when we asked her to.",

Also the lunch special price is REALLY great, 2 meals plus Thai ice tea for $22 is a great deal.  Cons: We sat our selves and we were served soup and water immediately but it took them awhile to take our order. Then my boyfriend got his food a good 15 minutes before I got mine. That really pisses me off when one person gets their food first. We should be served at the same time so we can eat together. It sucks when one person is finished before the other and they have to wait for the other person to eat.",

So I ordered an appetizer of veggie rolls, and a drink for myself.  When my date arrived,  he ordered yellow curry with chicken and I got the ruby curry fish. I ordered mine hot. The fish was light and flaky, the sauce was appropriately spicy and complex, and the vegetables were a good compliment to the rest of the dish.  For desert we split a thai coconut sticky rice with mango. It was good, but if I return I want to try it with custard instead of the mango.  Overall I was pleased with my meal and the service.

    "text": "There are times i wish we had a Thaitown or there was a cluster of really good Thai restaurants within a 5 mile drive of me but sadly most Thai places in metro Phoenix are just not that good with exception of a few gems. One gem is Thai Elephant. This review is based solely on the service I received ordering take out and the food itself.  I'm usually against ordering take out at a new establishment simply because it doesn't allow you to properly judge the place. Some places food just don't do well with takeout... like dim sum. So it's best to try out a place to get the full taste before coming back to take out home. Thai Elephant proved that its food was take out capable. It's been cold lately so I had a hankering for some curry to warm me up. I was ordering enough food for three people. I ordered some Tom Kha (coconut based soup), a seafood yellow curry, a chicken panang curry (red curry) and some Tofu Pad Pik King (stir fry green bean, bell pepper and spicy chili paste). The three entrees were all ordered HOT, and the Tom Kha was Thai HOT.  Take out service was usual, was given a menu to peruse, the hostess was patient and answered my questions and gave recommendations. The overall appearance of the restaurant was that it was somewhat largish, and tastefully decorated. This is not dirty kitchen Thai in anyway unlike the really good ones in Thaitown but the menu was quite extensive and prices were moderate too.   Food-wise this is one of the better Thai restaurants around. The yellow curry was delicious, I couldn't get enough of it, I kept on slurping the sauce. The Tom Kha was excellent that they did not kid with the spicy factor, loved it! It wasn't salty, no msg used, and the ingredients were fresh! My parents are hard to please when it comes to Thai especially since many of their close friends are Thai so they know what Thai food should taste like, so to hear them tell me that they want to buy from Thai Elephant in the future is proof of how they liked it.   Overall, Thai Elephant is a winner and a place that I'd like to come back to and have dinner at with friends. I loved what I ordered and I'm sure whoever I'm with, will too! If you're ever in Tempe, I recommend you stop by Thai Elephant if you're ever craving Thai cuisine!",

Very good portion size w lots of veggies, but just needed another level of flavor. Good and polite service.",

They sat me immediately, and took my order fairly quickly, but then it was over a half hour before I got my entree.  The Pad Thai was edible, but seriously lacking in flavor.  I asked for it medium spicy, but there was no heat whatsoever.  Just a bland, almost maple-syrup flavor.  I would have asked for some hot sauce, but between delivery of the food and the bill, nobody checked on me.  Guess I can't complain too much, however, as it was relatively cheap.  (But isn't most Thai food?).",

I gave it another try because it was busy that day, this time ordering \"to-go\". 55 minutes later I finally had my food in hand, even though they said it would be 20 minutes. The servers and hosts are nice but unfortunately they are so under staffed that they are running around non-stop and forget about you and your food.",

The place was packed with a lunch crowd as the one in Phoenix always was. Very busy, a bit loud.  I ordered the Golden Shrimp appetizer, and the Drunken Noodle with Chicken, both of which I frequently got at the other location. The breading on the shrimp was a bit too fried (not burnt but very dark) and greasy, the sweet dipping sauce was good and helped make up for that. I love flavorful food...the Drunken noodle was good, but the noodles and veggies were cooked a tad too long also and lacked the flavor I desire. This is being critical, cause once you get spoiled...you get spoiled! The food was good, but definitely not outstanding like the Phoenix location had been. I will probably go back here and try a few more dishes, but I will also be looking for that perfect/\"favorite\" Thai place as my go to. I don't think this is one I will crave! :)",

Glass noodle with chicken and shrimp has two measly shrimps in them, and the flavors that used to make this dish so good just weren't there anymore. The food didn't used to be that way so I'm not sure if there's a new chef working or what, but I'm very hesitant to go back. Looks like it's time to find a new Thai restaurant.  :(",

I had drunken noodles with chicken, also delicious. Went solo for dinner recently and got the chicken pad Thai and a Bangkok salad which was missing the spinach. That was just a big plate of big whole leaves of green leaf lettuce, sliced tomatoes, and sliced cucumber with a bland peanut dressing on the side. If there had been condiments on the table I'd probably have tried to fix that up a bit. I asked for a salad plate and cut up some into bite sized pieces to actually eat. Liked the noodles a lot. Big portion, nice ambience despite being in a strip mall and parking facing the glass front of the place. Good service, prices just fine, and I look forward to trying more dishes.",

It's not award winning stuff, but inexpensive, yummy and simple.  I suspect this is a firm favourite with students during term time and who could blame them? Drinks prices were average and the whole meal (with tips) came to around $25 a head. Great value!",

After a long day of traveling and client work I didn't want to go out to get food (Aloft doesn't have room service....boo). I ordered the basil stir-fry with beef and an order of edamame. They have an annoying 18$ minimum so I ordered a perrier to meet the minimum. The food arrived later than the yelp24 app estimated, the perrier was warmish, the edamame was kinda warm and the basil stir-fry came with chicken.  CHICKEN!!! I thought to myself \"where's the beef?!?\" but the food was very warm, the food smelled okay and I was starving so I just ate it but I wasn't happy about it.  The total price came to a little over $25, which is a bit pricey for an incorrect order of thai food.",

There's also a full bar with signature cocktails, try to pomegranate martini, its amazing! I usually go with Elephant Broccoli, which can be prepared with chicken, beef or tofu. Spring rolls and tempura vegetables are awesome as well.   Service has never been a problem for me, and we usually go during dinner time. Servers are always precise and prompt. Prices are fair and the quality is excellent. Desserts are tasty, try the coconut ice cream is there's any left.",

    "text": "I arrived at 3:30 PM on Sunday afternoon.  There was one table just finishing their meal when I arrived.  The waitress met me at the register and asked where I would like to sit.  She advised me that the restaurant closes at 4 PM to change over to dinner service, so I had 30 minutes to complete my meal.  She asked what I wanted to drink and went to get my water.  On her return, I told her I would like Som Tom, no green beans, Thai hot, with an order of jasmine rice.  She asked my consideration as she did not have her pad and could I wait while she went to get it?  Away she went to retrieve her order book, and on her return, she asked me again what I wanted.  I repeated my order and she wrote it down.  Off to the kitchen she went, looking at her watch as she walked away.  The table seated next to me were finished with their meal.  One of the diners opened the folio, looked at the bill and whistled.  He pulled out a card and walked up to the register.  The waitress came and processed his sale.  As they were walking out, another couple entered the restaurant.  The waitress let them know they had about 25 minutes before the restaurant closed to change over from lunch to dinner, and they might want to consider ordering to go so they would not feel rushed.  They answered that they would do their best to be done by 4 pm, so she brought them to a table.  She presented their menus and asked what they would like to order.  One diner asked for some water and a moment to consider the choices.  The other said they were ready.  The waitress advised she would bring water as soon as they placed their orders.  Once this was done, she went to the kitchen.    On her return, she brought water for the other table.  She went to the back service area, by the door to the outdoor dining, where she took out her compact and proceeded to powder her nose.  After that, she reapplied her lipstick.  She went to the kitchen and returned with my salad.  It appears the kitchen prepares their papaya ahead of time and the green beans are incorporated into the salad then.  The chef picked out the larger pieces of green bean, but what remained was lots of small pieces of chopped up green bean in the salad.  Portion size was discouraging, about 1 cup of salad on top of 2 cups of chopped lettuce, and while there was no mention of carrots in the salad, there was more carrot than there was papaya.  Rice was about 3/4 of a cup and apparently near the bottom of the pan.  It was dry and sticky.  The spice on the salad rated a 2.  I asked the waitress for more chile and lime.  She told me they were out of lime, but I could have lemon instead.  I repeated the request for chile, advising that lemon would not be an adequate substitute.  She returned with some chili.  I sprinkled this on my salad, but it was of no benefit.   While Som Tom should have accents of fish sauce, lime, palm sugar and chile, I tasted no sweet or lime.  The chile was disappointing.    Probably the worst part of the experience was the dirty table next to mine.  It was never cleared while I was at the restaurant.    After bringing me the chile for my order, the waitress went to the back service area and again applied powder and lipstick, then she brought the order to the other table.  She did not clear the table next to mine, nor did she offer to refill my water, though I was at the bottom of the glass.  This place may, as I have heard, have great drink prices for happy hour and cheap munchies for the same, but the salad and rice I received were certainly not the focal point of the chef.  I am doubting I will try this place again, as it seems to be all about the Happy Hour crowd.",

I thought it would be actual sweet potatoes, but it ended up being regular potatoes with the sweet dipping sauce. The description was a bit misleading, but it was delicious nonetheless.  For my entree I got the pad thai with tofu which was delicious! It really was the best pad thai i've ever eaten. My boyfriend got the green curry which he said was amazing as well.The service here was great too. The staff was very friendly and quick. I will definitely be back!",

I was expecting the typical small, cramped Chinese-like restaurant where they're mean to you and you feel scared for even asking for a fork. But this place was so nice on the inside, green decor, nice paintings on the wall, pretty lights everywhere. I'd even go there on a date. I ordered the most Thai dish there, Pai Tei, and I really enjoyed. Never had tofo before and I ate it all up. My friends had different dishes like yellow curry and from what I gathered everyone was satisfied. What impressed me the most was the food kept for like 2 days afterward and when I reheated it, still delish!",

Our entrees included orange chicken, pad z u (pad see ew), and yellow curry. The orange chicken was WAY too sweet, the pad z u noodles were mushy (think soft enough for a baby), and the yellow curry sauce was oddly thick which just gave it a weird texture and made me wonder if it had flour or some other thickening agent which is totally not necessary if you know how to make curry. Everything across the board lacked major flavor. Ever had a flavorless curry? I didn't think it was possible till I ate here. Portion sizes were huge but I'd rather be served half the food and have it taste good than to have leftovers of stuff I don't even want to take home.

The food isn't mindblowing but it's pretty good, and the price is right. The Tom Yum soup they serve during lunch is incredible, and their cocktail menu is really fun. The decor inside is dark and broody, if not a little cheesy...but the atmosphere is usually super relaxed, and not too loud (minus the occasional rowdy group of college kids - get off my lawn!). It's actually a perfect mix of intimate and casual.   Thai Elephant is right down the street from us so it's our go-to, and I'm not sure if we'd go out of our way for it if we were to move.

I'm one of those fat kids in a skinny-ish body, because I will eat every last bite on the plate in front of me. Generally the portions at Thai places are so huge I feel like a whale after I leave, but Thai Elephant does a good job with their potion sizes (at least for lunch) leaving me satisfied but not feeling glutenous.   I need someone to provide me some damn control, because I have none :-p  Quick, friendly service. Clean, comfy interior. No complaints.   Try the Siamese Basil or Drunken Noodles with Tofu.

The waitress let us to be seated, she left two menus on the table, but she never returned. We waited and waited, she walked by a few times but never stopped at our table. We've been waiting for about at least 20 minutes, eventually we decided to leave. When we walked out the door, she was on the phone and didn't even noticed. Oh well, thinking about my previous experience with this place, undercooked food, turtle speed service, I don't think I will come back here.",

The patio looks charming as well with the lights but it's too hot to sit out there during summer so we haven't experienced it. We probably eat here about 8-10 times a month. No joke we had take out like 3 times in one week once! My favorite dishes are the pineapple fried rice but I order without the mixed vegetables it comes with as I feel it takes away from the favors. I also love the beef pad Thai, and the teriyaki chicken of Siam. Staff is always very friendly, sometimes they mess up our orders i.e. Not leaving the veggies out or giving us white instead of brown rice with the chicken. None of which are usually a big deal.",

The curry itself was delicious, probably the best yellow curry I've ever had. Just the perfect blend of salty and sweet, whereas most Thai places I've tried have been overly salty. Rated a star down because 25% of the potatoes were a bit undercooked. They definitely give you a lot of curry, enough for two or three meals. It reheats well (it's soup, after all) and gives you the most bang for your buck.  My friend had the pad thai with chicken. The spice system here is a bit on the Americanized side. Normally a 4/5 level of Thai spiciness would have me reaching for a glass of something, but their 4/5 is more comparable to a 2/5. Not even a little tingle in the mouth. Not a big deal for me since while my mouth likes spicy, the rest of me doesn't (TMI) but my friend was a bit disappointed. The chicken was really good, though, definitely not like the strangely shaped defrosted pieces you might find elsewhere.They also put some fried tofu bits in their pad thai, and strangely enough the tofu tasted a lot better than the tofu in my curry.",

I was already out and about and currently waiting on others, so I got out my Yelp app and looked them up, and saw I could place an order though Yelp, I checked out the menu and placed the order for pick up.  I ordered the Satay Chicken and Siam Masaman Curry. The Satay Chicken was perfectly grilled and was tender and juicy, and went great with peanut sauce,  I just love the peanut sauce, I could smoother everything in that! Oh soo good!  The Masaman curry I ordered medium heat and with chicken, and it was just what I had been craving.  The curry was sweet, creamy and spicy all the same time, the chicken and potatoes and carrots were tender, this was the perfect dish for a cold Sat night ( and for a Sunday brunch haha, gotta love leftovers).   Thank you Teresa for the suggestion I think I have found a new goto Thai place near me.",

The wait staff is very sweet and knowledgeable of the food if you have any questions. They get crazy busy during the lunch rush, but make sure that you are seated and have your meal on time. Also, the serving sizes are huge so you'll have leftovers for a late afternoon snack if you can't finish your meal like me! :D   The lunch specials come with soup and a spring roll, both of which are delicious.  My favorite lunch special here is the Siamese Basil. The chicken is so soft and so flavorful at mild spicy. It goes with the white rice very well. I wish I had a picture but I was so hungry that I devoured it before I could think about clicking any photos. If it's your first time here, please give this entree a try, you will not be disappointed!!",

I thought the pre-meal soup was sub-par being overly sweet and not spicy or salty enough to balance out the sweetness.  I could do without the soup next time.    I ordered the Green Curry lunch special - with a 4 / 5 on the hot scale.  The curry was tasty and was my favorite thing about the entire meal, but some of the vegetables were chopped so large I had to cut them up to try to eat them; One section of eggplant was cut so large that the middle hadn't cooked through.  As for spiciness, the 4 was very mild (too mild). Overall though, a very solid curry.  The included eggroll was only OK, and as seems to be the trend, not nearly enough rice included to go around.  The service was efficient but not overly friendly or helpful, but they were fine.  Overall, I have no real complaints about Thai Elephant, I wouldn't object to going here, but I will not seek it out in the future.",

However the food is well worth the wait. Evenings are a bit easier or takeout eases the stomach. Prices are reasonable and the servings are generous. My favorite is still the green curry with any of the meat choices. Try the fry banana with coconut ice-cream if you want to share a delectable but simple desert.  I had another amazing meal at this restaurant. I'm guilty of loving the coconut  curry. This time I botched up the heat and had beef instead of chicken. The meat just melted in my mouth and the spice added just the right amount of heat. It's an extremely popular and well loved place. So definitely be prepared for s little wait during rush hours and popular work day crowds.",

    "text": "ELEPHANT WALK  What a disorganized bunch. We ate here a month ago, and had a mediocre experience. The previous two times had been stellar, so we returned last night. We arrived to a less than half full restaurant and were seated right away. More than 5 minutes later the young waitress came by and asked if we wanted something to drink. We ordered drinks and asked for water. My large Sapporo (I wanted a draft beer) came as two small Sapporos (bottles): no water. Edamame came: Meh.  Ordered dinner I ordered the Snow Pea dish and my partner ordered an entree and requested that the veggies be steamed with no sauce (part of her diet). 15 minutes later the manager came out to let us know that they had no snow peas, dropped a menu off and left. 5 minutes later I flagged someone down to take my new order.  My dish arrives 10 minutes later, but it seems that they forgot my partner's order. She picks from my plate because we were hungry (that's why we went out to eat) and 10 minutes later hers arrives less the noodles. We mention them and off they go: one more mention and the noodles arrive when her meal is about finished, 10 minutes later. Now the bill comes: her meal is billed all a la carte, including noodles (which were part of the entree) and rice, which was never served. I am usually a 20%+ tipper, but was so disappointed, that for the first time in at least 30 years I left no tip. I expressed my concerns to the indignant, unhelpful, uncaring manager and suggested that SHE needed to take care of the waitress. No, \"I am sorry you had a bad experience\" or \"we had some issues in the kitchen\", she looked down and just turned and walked away.             Me too.            (good bye)",

Despite the fact that I already had Thai for lunch, most places that she wanted to try out almost never disappoint. Sure! Let's go!  The restaurant is well decorated. I love all of the paintings that they hang on the wall. I ordered the King of garlic with beef that comes with a side of Jasmine rice. If you love the taste of garlic, this dish is definitely heavenly. The beef is tender and completely covered with the taste of garlic (with garlic flakes all over it). I also tried a bite of the drunken noodles with shrimps. The portion was generous and noodles are tasty. Another dish I tried was the Pad Thai. It is just as delicious. When we finished the meal, I was so full that I rolled myself out the door.   Service is quick and friendly. If you are in the area looking for good Thai food with huge amount of selections, this is the place to be.",

The interior of the restaurant is tasteful, well-maintained and spacious. The layout sort of wraps around a semi-circle, with the bar keenly separated in the back, attached to a cozy patio. I'm the type of person that always notices the music playing in a store or restaurant. The music choice in here was pretty interesting; a good deal of '90s hip hop, including the famous Cops' theme song, Inner Circle's \"Bad Boys.\" Lots of volume and bass going on as well, it was really unexpected, but kind of awesome.   I usually try out a new restaurant by ordering something basic. I got the Pad Thai at the \"Hot\" level. They didn't go easy, their \"Hot\" level was nice and spicy. The food was delicious. Fresh, vibrant, and full of flavor. None of it was soggy or too salty. My partner in crime ordered the Spicy Eggplant, which also featured fresh, well-prepared ingredients. Eggplant is sort of hit or miss with me, but this was cooked to perfection.   The menu is extensive and has lots of interesting options. Including a dish called \"Crazy Beef Salad.\" I will absolutely be back to Thai Elephant very soon.",

After a short wait we were shown our table and served a small bowl of what tasted like Tom Yum broth.... nice little appetizer.    The menu was nice and had a lot of tasty-looking items along with a fairly large lunch menu, priced at $7.95 which gets you entree, rice, and egg roll.  You can substitute brown rice also for about a buck.  Our order was taken fairly quickly, but our food took forever to come out.  The place was packed and they were swamped, so I can understand, but if you are on a strict time schedule, this might be a problem for you.  My Drunken Fried Rice with chicken arrived looking great.  Plate was nice, presentation was attractive.  After one bite I was like, \"wow, this is really good\".  The fried rice plate was very good.  Chicken was perfectly cooked, very tender and moist, veggies were crisp and fresh, and the dish was spicy, but not overboard (note:  I ordered it \"spicy\").  Another huge bonus for those of us who don't consume milk products and love Thai Tea is the fact they have soy milk!  Awesome.  I'm anxious to try more dishes here, but if you're a fried rice fan, you are sure to appreciate this place and if you're a dairy-free Thai Tea fan, you're sure to love this place.",

I actually liked the mediocre service that they gave.  They didn't hound me for anything anddidn't ask if my food was good when my mouth was full of food.

My favorites so far have been the drunken noodles and the thaitalian spaghetti with tofu.   They definitely know how to do spicy, so know that if you ask for medium, it's going to be HOT! I like to stick with mild because it still has a good amount of spice and flavor without being burn-your-tongue hot.   One last, but important thing to mention about Thai Elephant is that they have the soft, delicious, melt-in-your-mouth mints to help you recover from the party that has just taken place in your mouth.",

I ordered Pad Kee Mao and specifically asked that it be Double Thai Hot (that is, as spicy as possible).  What I received 20 minutes later was what might only be described as mild.  It was a huge disappointment.   If my friends all insist on going here again, I may tag along.  But I'll do my best to steer them to something more exciting.  Thai food for grandmas.",

    "text": "Just came home from a great meal at Thai Elephant.  We had only been to Thai Basil, many times, and since we pass this everytime we go there, this time we decided to stop at T.E. instead.  I am glad I did.  I wanted Thai because I woke up feeling a little cold coming on and love spicy food when I am feeling under the weather.  The restaurant is pretty big compared to Basil and not as warm, but it is perhaps a little more formal and classy.  They also serve alcohol, which includes Mai Tai's and Thai beer.   We both, my girlfriend and I, had very nice Jasmine tea.  The menu is big, maybe 30 dishes, and there is a separate lunch menu which is about the same size.  The average price is about $10 for dinner and the variety is great.  There are some cute typos on the menu, I think that is mark of authenticity, as is the waitress' not-so-great English.  We ordered pad-thai and a Masaman curry.  The pad thai was delicious, the chicken with it was very fresh and it always comes with tofu, which was better than most tofu I've had.  The Masaman (sweet nut) curry was delicious and spicy.  I had only had Basil's Masaman, and this was much better, more taste than just coconut milk (though Basil's is good too).  I would go to Basil for a cheaper meal, but this seems like a little more work went into the sauces and meat was better quality.  They have a nice happy hour with cheap dishes and drinks from 5-7pm.",

The atmosphere was ethnic contemporary, with lots of dark woods, comfortable seating, and very hip, casual music.  We went around 6pm on a Monday, and it wasn't crowded at all. They have happy hour specials from 5-7pm, so we ordered a couple of Singhas for $3 each, along with the fried sweet potatoes, shrimp, and vegetable egg rolls at half price--all delicious. I would say the sauces could be more varied; they were plum sauce varieties and mainly sweet.   To follow the appetizer specials, we shared a drunken noodle dish at medium spicy, which is just enough tang for a mild tongue. The wide noodles, Thai basil and light sauce (also a hint sweet) were nicely balanced with the mix of veggies.  We topped it off with the only dessert we hadn't seen before: the Triangle Roti, a platter of freshly fried sliced puff pastry with a light sweet spirit and sprig of mint. This reminded us of sopapillas, except lighter in texture.  Overall, we had a great meal. I might opt to order a broader variety of tastes, e.g., fewer fried and more savory ... but we were novice eaters at this place and will surely return.",

I just went out for my first test run of the place, and found it even better than the downtown location!  The staff was over the top, my waiter Alex was beyond belief. They made it feel like I was visiting an old relatives place for dinner, instead of a restaurant.   I got the same thing I get almost every day Downtown, Pad Zu with beef, and it didn't let me down. I also tried some cocktails for happy hour, and really enjoyed the Ginger Binger (A rum based drink with muddled ginger and ginger beer) And the Basil Lemongrass Mojjito. Since the downtown location doesn't have a full bar, it was nice to experiment with some Thai cocktails.  Overall I would say I have found my new Thai place for dinner, and would recommend this place for anyone who feels like having a great sit down experience.",

At one point I literally thought I heard sirens and found myself zonning out on my conversation my mind instead wandering to where the nearest ER was and if my insurance would cover something like this.  Anyway,  it was a good thing.  A very good thing.   I love the panag and this place makes it the way I like it.  I usually get it Thai Hot which is their \"hottest\" spice level but this time, maybe the cooks had read some of the \"not hot enough\" flavored reviews on here, because he brought the heat.  Their Thai Iced-Tea is yummy.  It was my only saving grace.  I slowly sipped at when I felt tears welling in my eyes.    During lunch I'd say arrive early or just after lunch rush.  They have gotten better with their service from when they first opened several months ago.  When its packed you are going to wait though.  They offer this little bowl of hot seasoned water (soup?) before the meal which I think is nice.  Keeps you entertained while you wait for your food.  Also I love that they throw in a spring roll for dishes on their lunch menu.  Oh, the atmosphere in there is pretty nice for a spot tucked away in a strip mall.  Last time i was there they were playing some nice jazz.  The decor is earthy and warm.  One thing though, they could REALLY use a water feature.  Like a fountain or a fish tank.  Oh yeah, I don't think I'll be getting Thai Hot again. But I will most certainly be back.",

It has affordable prices and great selections. I like that you can have a quick meal if you are in a hurry and not shell out a ton a of money. Lunch there is amazing, as it includes soup and a spring roll. In Tempe and surrounding areas, this is the only way to eat Thai!",

There was definitely a lot of pork in my dish but it was tough and flavorless.

Also, I like Thai food flavored with fish sauce but I don't think they use it here.",

The 3 comes from the fact that the Pad Thai was dreadfully dry and flavorless... Eventually we resorted to pouring all of the leaked liquids from the other packages on top of the dry noodles to allow a very disappointed 16 year old to eat. Overall, eh.   We will likely try again, but with VERY specific instructions (e.g. add flavor and sauce).",

They do a good job at not overpowering the taste of the curry with the spices.  Lots of times places won't make the curry hot enough for me OR it'll overpower the actual taste of the food and all I will taste is spices.  They manage to make that shit pretty spicy without losing the flavor.  Very important.  I eat curry all over the place and this spot is hands down my favorite.",

Most recent visit, the server completely ignored our table after we ordered. To start, they took our order as fast as possible, and treated our table like we were an inconvenience for being there. We waited for 30 minutes to get our food (durning work lunch hour) and waited as every table around received their food, even though they arrived well after us. I finally asked our server to box our food to go, as we had needed to leave. Again, we were ignored the entire time. Who knows how long we would have sat there without food, as everyone pretended we were not sitting in the restaurant. No apology, nothing. They went to \"box\" the order, and we waited another 15 minutes. They still didn't bring the food. BUT, they for sure remembered to bring a check and have us pay for the food. I finally gave up and asked for a refund for the food since it was clear they did not have it boxed or ready for us. The service here is completely unacceptable. It is never okay to ignore people! For sure not going to be returning, which is a shame, as this was a staple for my team.",

Very flavorful food, from Thai hot which is my favorite if you are a spicy lover of foods, or to even mild for those not adventurous! What I recommend is the papaya salad, make sure you get a side of sticky rice if available or steamed rice is ok too! And the pad Thai is wonderful too! Will come back again soon! Enjoy!",

I ordered them a 4 star spicy out of 5. The Tom Kha was a little spicier than i would have expected but very good flavor and was full off meat and mushrooms. I think had i ordered it at a 3 it would have been perfect as even at 4 it was very spicy but because of the other flavors I still wanted to finish it all. The Panang was good as well and just enough heat to my liking but others who don't want their tongues burning may be better at a 2 or 3 star. Again like with the soup there was plenty of meat and veggies as well as plenty of sauce which i love mixing with rice. When ordering for lunch the Panang also includes rice and a veggie egg roll which while not the best or biggest egg roll or the most rice are still a great deal for just under $8. With the total meal coming to $14 after tax i was very pleased and had enough left over for small meal or snack.",

When I got here a little after 12, it was VERY busy - almost full - but when I left around 1 it had cleared out a little.   Additionally, and this is not a judgment on the restaurant at all, the actual entrance is not the door facing University (through an outdoor seating area), it's on the other side of the building. I didn't realize immediately so stood at the back bar for a minute confusedly.   There are also two bike racks - one on the side facing University, and the other on the side with the actual front door. I don't know if this information will be of any use to anybody, but since University is great for cycling and Thai Elephant is fairly close to campus, I don't think it's inconceivable that other ppl might thinking of biking there.   The food was good! The lunch specials on the menus in restaurant reflect a price a dollar higher than the price listed on the online menu - to me, this seems fairly inconsequential, but people on Yelp love to complain about inconsistencies b/w online and offline information.   Service was prompt and to the point, the food was good, it's a good location with what looked like ample parking. Worth visiting.",

So delicious and flavorful - spice just as you prefer from zero (like me) to Thai Hot (for hubby!) I've had the oh-so-delicious Pineapple Fried Rice, The Yellow Curry with Potato & Carrot, and the Pad Thai. I can't get enough of any of these fabulous dishes and when asked where to head for dinner out, I just want to scream, \"Thai Elephant!!\"",

    "text": "Came here friday evening after a long drive from california.  It was nice that they had a happy hour menu for the time we showed up.  We ordered the blanket shrimp as well as the golden shrimp and the calamari for appetizers.  They were crisp and crunchy and the sauces accompanied the food well.  I ordered the seafood siam manaman curry medium heat, and the amount of curry they provide was generous.  Also had large portions of fish and scallops which was nice.  Overall u wish it was spicier but that was on me, u got it 3 out of 5 on the hot scale.  We also ordered a mild Tom kha soup.  Again, wish it was spicier but I had made the choice tho.  Buy their mixed drink was watered down and I couldn't taste the liquor in it unfortunately... Service was fast, the servers were attentive and nice, decor was inviting.  The only knock tho was my dad stated there were flies flying around his feet and he visualized several of them as well, which is offputting  If not for that it would have been a definite 5 stars!!!",

It isn't worth the poison: your food is maybe a 3/5 - definitely not better tasting or better priced than local alternatives like Thai Basil or most other local restaurants - and they didn't give me food poisoning! The chili isn't real thai chili - it's a paste that you didn't even mix in well, and the noodles don't appear to be cooked fresh to order. Many of the dishes aren't authentic Thai, per se. In short, you make Americanized Thai food, and it's pretty average. If you hadn't poisoned me, I'd give you three stars.  Will not be back.",

Serving was generous, that I'll be eating leftovers for days. The tofu was too fried, but was edible when soaked in the curry.   The curry comes with mushrooms, and I specifically asked for no mushrooms. The waitress asked, \"is it an allergy or preference?\" I really appreciated this because they were taking food allergies seriously. Unfortunately, I still had mushrooms in my food, and i just got an \"oh\" from the staff.  Major disappointment for me.   Overall, the food was delicious, service could have been attentive.",

    "text": "I was feeling peckish for some Thai food and decided to try this place out partially due to the location and partially due to the menu. The choices are quite extensive with some of the entrees having amusing names or elephant related names. Jingle jungle? Thaitalian spaghetti? I love it!  Elephantitis cocktail? It's kind of weird to name your mixed drink after a rare and debilitating disease but as long as I don't get elephantitis from drinking it I'll go with it!  I had the daily special, a mango curry, ordering it with seafood. I also tried the drunken noodles and the king of garlic.   The mango curry was a hefty portion of red curry sauce, vegetables, and seafood including fish, scallops, shrimp, and calamari. The scallops were rubbery tasting but the other seafood were cooked well. I was disappointed that I requested this dish hot but it tasted very mild to me, like a 2/10 in scale of spiciness. In general the curry was too sweet for me and it had more of a one dimensional taste compared to other dishes I tried.  The drunken noodles had a depth of flavor and a hint of smokiness which was great. It was a sizable portion as well.  The king of garlic was a mighty meal living up to its name. This is the stuff that vampires have nightmares about because of the amount of garlic they packed in this dish. It was a knock out punch of bold flavors, varied textures, and a hint of spiciness. The beef was tender and well seasoned. It was probably the best dish out of the few that I tried.  I had a Thai iced tea to go with my meal which was too sweet for my tastes. They serve it automatically with ice but in the menu it says they will charge you $.75 if you request it with low ice or no ice. Interesting.  I wasn't too impressed with my meal but I did enjoy the king of garlic so I'll be back to try some more off the menu. Overall 3.5/5.",

Finally asked one of the wait staff about our order, he said it was coming.  Another 5 minutes, another table served.  We were informed that our food was coming, so I said just pack it to go, cuz I've got to get back to work.  Seriously, it was 12:22 pm.    I told the person up front when I went to pay about the wait, she said oh because the stir fry takes longer to make.  We ordered off of the lunch menu it wasn't like we asked for anything special.  I don't know about anyone else, but I got an hour for lunch and I can't wait 30 minutes to get the food after ordering.

    "text": "This is one place I will not be going to again.  I am extremely disappointed in how they handled an issue we had in the restaurant.  About 2 months ago around 11:30 when we walked into the restaurant.  As soon as we walked in we were seated and given water and soups; typical of most Thai restaurants.  We ordered our food and with in 10-15 min our food was on the table.  Up to this point the service was fast and good.  We started to eat and most of us were enjoying our meals.  Half way through the meal my friend made a noise and the look on his face told us something was wrong.  He dropped his fork and reached into his mouth and pulled out a staple.  The staple wasn't your normal staple for stapling papers it was the kind used to shipping; you have probably seen them on boxes when you buy a piece of furniture that you need to put together.  If you have worked in a grocery store you would probably recognize the staple as the kind they use to staple the boxes closed on vegetables.  The staple was about 2 in long and with two 1 in end that had been turned down.  My friend said it poked him in the cheek as he bit down on it.  After he pulled the staple out he rinsed his mouth with water and checked for any cuts the staple may have caused.  Thankfully he didn't have any.  He called the waiter over and they looked at the staple and just said I don't know how that got in there and walked away.  About 5 min another person walked over and said your waiter notified me that you had an issue with your food.  So my friend explained what happen and again and this person had the same response and walked into the kitchen.  Another 5 min goes by when they came back to our table and said we don't know how that got into your food or where it came from.  They offered to take is plate and make another dish but my friend declined so the manager offered to comp his meal.  The reason this was a bad experience was instead of fessing up that it was their fault and communicating with us to let us know what was going on they would just walk away and then return to our table with no explanation.  They should have offered to give him a free meal for next time in addition to comping his meal and had better communication.  Honestly it is easy to see how the staple got into the food.  They were either opening produce boxes next to the stoves and when they did this one of the staples came off the top and landed in the pan.  The other way would be the staple was already in the box of veggies and when they dumped them on the cutting board to be cut it was in the mix and they didn't see it.",

    "text": "There are two Thai places in this plaza. The 5RCha, which is basically all self-serve and fast food, and Thai Elephant, which is sit down with waiter service. As I was getting food with the family, we opted for the sit down place instead.  Despite the two restaurants supposedly not being connected (according to the lady in 5RCha), I thought the menus were pretty similar. Thai Elephant definitely has a bigger one, and their entire restaurant is quite big with very nice decor.  Service was very good when we went, as the restaurant was less than half full. That being said, there was still one mishap with our order as my mom ordered the glass noodle soup and it came out sans glass noodles. It had to be brought back into the kitchen and replaced, but the replacement occurred pretty quickly.  Food was good. I got the Pad Z U (beef), my dad got the yellow curry (chicken), and my mom got the glass noodle soup (shrimp, cup). My mom's order was by far the smallest, but my dad and I got very generous portions and I had leftovers to take home. The only area where they weren't so generous was the tiny bowl of rice my dad got, which may be a dealbreaker for rice lovers out there.  For dessert, we tried their Thairamasu. Warning: It's not really tiramisu. It's a thin layer of cake on top of chocolate-y, coffee-ish ice cream. It was also TINY, but maybe we shouldn't have expected much from a $4-5 dessert? Still, it was a bit disappointing to see.  The price was pretty typical of a Thai restaurant, with all entrees falling between the $10 - $20 range  So why the loss of two stars? In general, while I did enjoy my meal, it wasn't the best Thai food I had ever tasted and even worse, it wasn't even the best in the same area of Tempe. I don't think I'd make the short trek out to Thai Elephant or even recommend it to my friends--not over the 5 R Cha or Thai Rama near ASU at least.",

    "text": "Somewhat of a mixed bag. Our party of 4 was seated immediately (it was slow), on a Sunday night. We ordered Thai iced teas, and browsed the menu. The teas took rather a long time, given that it was a slow night. The service overall was polite but very slow.   Our main courses all were served over the span of about 10 or 12 minutes - that is, the first dish arrived, then 2-3 minutes later, another dish, another pause, then another... It made those of us who did not have their meal yet feel all the hungrier.  I had the Ginger Heaven, spiced 4 on a scale of 1-5. It was tasty and I enjoyed my meal - though I didn't feel it was exactly 4/5's of the way to maximum spice. My son enjoyed his dish as well, which was a basil and chicken entree. I can't recall the exact name.  The curry was another story. The rest of our party had red curry with tofu and yellow curry with chicken, at 3 and 2 stars of spiciness, respectively.  Both curries were very bland, and too sweet. Neither person finished their dish, nor did they want to. Not a trace of heat in either dish, and I was surprised that the curry was simply not very flavorful. In fact, I'd have a hard time telling the difference between the yellow and the red curry... they both tasted about the same.  I doubt I'll go again anytime soon, but if you do go, I recommend staying away from the curry dishes.",

The atmosphere was beautiful and I had wished I could dine in but she said it was 7 minutes to lunch closing. The young girl at the counter was nice as I arrived but seemed bothered that I came in close to lunch being over. I proceeded to order take out. Ordered fresh rolls and happily asked for a recommendation for another appetizer -She suggested golden shrimp for 8.95. I figured at that price I would get fairly large shrimp in a decent sized container. What I got was shriveled up \"barely there\" tiny shrimp covered in greasy crusted fried batter all stuck together in a small container. MAYBE 7 pieces of shrimp...My total for two small appetizers was close to $16 ! I proceeded to get a refund for the shrimp as it was not at all worth the money spent. The young girl never even apologized or offered to ask if I would like something else. Never gave me eye contact- ran the credit - slapped down the return receipt and proceeded to walk away ( still no sorry or eye contact ). Due to her rudeness I definitely won't be supporting this local restaurant again. Get a clue - if you want a satisfied customer have better manners than that. I expected way more.",

The papaya salad was just bland and had absolutely no kick to it despite my telling them I wanted it to be 7/10 on the heat level. Papaya salad that is not spicy isn't good unless it's made with a lot of flavor. Not the case here.  The atmosphere was good. I thought the layout and lighting was really good and made for a comfortable dining experience. What they need is to get a waiter that knows Thai food and then to deliver on the spiciness they promised.",

Lunch was good, the lunch items come with a type of broth, and an eggroll as well. We got yellow curry with tofu and green curry with chicken. Both were very good.  The potatoes were cooked just right. That can really determine if it is good or not.  That kept refilling my friends tea(hot) which he loved. I got the Thai Ice Tea. Great! The bathroom in this place could of used a bit of a scrub down. The door handle was disgusting,really coated in everyone touching it.  During this cold and flu season I always think about that.",

Dear Thai Elephant Sadists: When you are running a restaurant, you need to know that when a customer requests a dish made \"spicy,\" which is on your menu and not a special request, this is not an invitation to a staff joke where you dump two tablespoons of crushed red pepper directly into a single order. I would like to think that the dish is cooked with the heat in it to enhance flavor, not just to show off to the non-Asian folk who DARE to have the NERVE to ask for it spicy. \"I'll show YOU what spicy means, DUBYA.\" Because I happen to be Asian, grew up on kimchee, and I can take it. Until today - this is just plain ridiculous. Who the FUCK would EVER eat it like this?? PLEASE see the photo I uploaded of this piece of broccoli with nothing but PURE CRUSHED CHILIS STUCK IN ITS BRANCHES.  If it's going to be super, ass-flaming spicy when you order it, they should tell you it's over-the-top and not intended for you to actually taste your food. I have been guzzling water and rinsing my mouth and it's going to be a few hours before I can even find something else to eat while my tastebuds and lips recover.",

The crazy beef salad is different from any other Thai beef salad we've ever ordered, but in a good way. The beef was crunchy, and the flavors were less limey and more garlicky. At first I was disappointed at how little lettuce there was, but it ended up being a good ratio!   We got our usual: yellow curry with chicken for him, and pad see ew with beef for me. He loved his dish, though I found my pad see ew a bit dry, hardly spicy  (though I got a 4), and a bit lacking in egg. I did, however, like that they included cabbage, which differs from the typical pad  see ew that only has a few sprigs of broccoli in it. The portions were large (about 2.5 meals for me), which was great, but I dont think I'll be back here again.",

I ordered a cup of their Tom Kha soup with chicken and always get a side of Jasmine rice to pour it over {makes it last a lot longer and fills you up!}. It was SO delicious and definitely competes with my fav spot in town. For my entree, I ordered the Pad Z U with beef and it may just be one of my new fav Thai dishes. It is made with the wide rice noodles and has a sauce very similar to Pad Thai. I LOVED the veggies in it and trust me, they did not skimp on the beef! The beef tasted fresh and lean, not chewy at all. The wide noodles are such a nice change and I think they will be a regular in my Thai food favorites rotation!   The best part - the portions were HUGE so I was able to stretch it out between 2 dinners and a lunch! Yes, please! I will absolutely be back to Thai Elephant!",

We ordered pork fried rice, pad Thai noodles with tofu, and red ruby curry fish. No taste.  Meh. Even with extra pepper.   My younger son is a picky eater and we asked for fried rice or noodles with nothing on it and they said they could not accommodate us on a special order. We would need to order an entree (which cost $10.95) and request some items to be deleted. I asked why couldn't they just give me $2 side and I would pay extra. They said cannot be done. No flexibility whatsoever.  Throughout the menu they nickel and dime you for many items. One example is ice tea If you ask with no ice then they charge you an extra 75 cents. However when I asked if they can accommodate my son, they said no.  Food was bland and very dry. I will not go back.  Not customer service oriented.  Sorry Thai Elephant. You need to be customer oriented. Peace out",

There are many  closer thai restaurants to me than Thai Elephant but none compare.  I usually get the pad thai, green curry, change up the 3rd dish and a thai iced tea.  I have never been dissapointed.  The prices are reasonable, the service is fine and the only thing I would change would be to make the thai iced teas bigger, the're not small but La's thai and Thai house in scottsdale give you bigger glasses.  If you're looking for good thai, definitely come here!",

Many times when I order something with garlic in the name, I am disappointed to find it not True to the name. This place lived up to it's name and that makes this garlic girl happy!   They ask you how spicy you want your meal. I went with medium. That was perfect for eating it there (with the exception of one really hot bite, yikes!). But I did have leftovers, thanks to the good size portion. The heat definitely intensifies in the leftovers!!! So unless you plan on finishing or sharing your meal, you may want to opt for slightly lower heat setting so that your leftovers don't knock your socks off.  I was not a fan of the soup they give you at the beginning. The service was just ok.",

Was satisfied with the dish, but it did not hold a candle to the green curry I had at the Phoenix location, or to any of the other restaurants I've had it, for that matter.  Enjoyed the tofu; it was the curry sauce that wasn't as great as the one I adored at the Phoenix branch.  One more thing, why add corn to the eggroll filling??  Not authentic.      May try other lunch items at a later date, but I think I'll just go to the Adams St. location, instead.  Tastier selections there, and better service too!",

    "text": "So I have a friend who reads my reviews from Yelp when they are posted on Facebook. Almost after every review she instructs me to have Thai - I guess good Thai food is in short supply in Athens, GA. Looking at the Yelp listings, that is not the case here.   Out of my available options near work, I chose Thai Elephant. I had good reviews, and let's face it, who doesn't love an elephant? The parking was easy to get into and the store was packed - a good sign of good food. I enjoyed the deco with paper lanterns.  The soup was the first course and it was a good thing I wasn't blind folded. I would have thought some scallions and a hint of pepper dropped in the lemon-Joy dishwater. Yuck. Thankfully the Thai tea removed all hint of soup. It was $2.25 for the tea and what a treat! I ordered the lunch special of drunken noodle with chicken - it is Thai wide noodles sauteed with jalapeno, yellow onion, carrots, broccoli, cabbage, bell pepper and basil. I could definitely taste the basil and although I responded \"mild\" to the question of mild vs. spicy - I am not sure what the spicy would have tasted like YIKES! Definitely bring a hankie for the mild. If you have sinus issues, have that! I have to say of the Thai places I have had, this ranks up there is the best. For $7.95 for the lunch portion, it was a great size and worth the price.   I also liked the staff did not harass me during eating. They brought the soup, the tea and the food. Once they asked if it was good and I didn't see them again until time for the check. Now one lady asked if I wanted the check, a different lady brought the check (to which I gave my card), then the first lady returned with the bill (until I said someone already brought it) and a third lady came by to ask if I needed my check. I guess they are very diligent on the payment end. But the food was great, so I will be back!",

He ordered Medium since it was our first time and some places are hotter than others. It wasn't too hot by any means, easily could have ordered hot.

The decor of the place is nice, and the service was great.  However the food was bad. I got the vegetarian drunken noodles as recommended by the waitress. I swear by this, but if the water tastes good, crisp, clean, filtered, you know it will be good thai food. My second sign was that the water was tap.  The drunken noodles was bland, no basil leaves, and the tofu was store bought, soggy and falling apart.  The Sriracha sauce was not even in the right bottle, instead they transferred it into a little pot. Thought this was class, but when i tasted it, it was bitter and nothing like Sriracha.  I also had the vegetarian summer rolls. The rolls were good, but no basil leaves again. That's a staple thai spice! The peanut sauce was decent, but definitely tasted like it came out of a bottle.  The price was also on the expensive side. My noodles and summer rolls came out to about $20 for lunch.  One star for the nice friend service.",

I was working one night and decided to Grub Hub in my food, a Tempe regular strongly suggested trying this place out. Drunken Noodle with Chicken and mild sauce was the recommendation and I was completely blown away. I've stopped in four times in 2 months for the same dish. Absolutely incredible. The meat here is always tender and cooked to perfection. The drunken noodle texture and portion size with veggies is very well balanced. And the FLAVOR is to die for. Price is fair if not very forgiving to your wallet. Service is solid, this is a traditional thai restaurant, so you have to understand the pace and multiple hats your server is working that night (be patient, you get everything you need in a timely matter), worth mentioning based on other reviews.   Honorable mentions: Thai iced coffee is to perfection and their salted edamame is a great way to start!  The Thai hot sauce is notagame, IT IS HOT, also delicious... but be prepared (I always order it to the side). Anyways this area really doesn't have much great traditional food from any culture. Downtown Tempe is flooded with fast food and corporate restaurants, so go spend your money here and get excited to have some of the best food in Tempe!",

As I'm sitting here writing this, I've been done with my food, still not being approached by waitress.   Update 9/10/2019, decided to give this place a second chance and was once again dissatisfied. The papaya salad had 2 shrimps on it and was pretty pathetic in my opinion. Same with the fresh shrimp rolls, the noodles inside were VERY mushy, the lettuce in them was not good and they were not wrapped well.

    "text": "Wow! Hands down my new favorite Thai restaurant in the East Valley... err the whole valley!  My fiance and I were in the area. He mentioned that we should grab dinner before going home and suggested that we go here. I have never seen it and was never on my radar.   We turned around and stopped it. It was quite empty on a Monday at 6pm. They do happy hour with discounted apps and drinks. We weren't in the drinking mood so we just ordered our entrees. The menu is pretty extensive. I finally decided on the Mango Tango Fish. Not only was it fun to say but it was godd@mn delicious!! The lightly battered and perfectly fried fish topped with an impeccable mango salad.   My fiance ordered his usual... not his usual here. His usual at any Thai restaurant, yellow curry with chicken. It was so good, I think I saw his eyes rolled to the back of his head.   Anyway, I'll be bringing my BFF and her family here when they are in town this week!",

    "text": "Here comes another crew member review based off a delivery order: I was having trouble deciding which Thai place I would order with, but settled on this one due to some of the reviews, and I am glad I did! They were fast in preparing, quick to delivery, and the food was fresh, hot and extremely flavorful!   As I've said many times, I've had Thai all across this country, and this was by far one of the best! The portions were large, included some tofu that was cooked just right, full of flavor, and slightly crispy. They are also not stingy on the chicken at all which is a nice change of pace since most places use other fillers to save a dime. I was able to use this as two meals, so it was delicious and cost effective! If you're in the area near The Hampton and Sheraton over here then you'll know there isn't much around, and even a trip to the fast station is quite the walk, so just order from these guys and you won't regret it (and you will save yourself from nasty gas station food)!  Just don't be a hungry moron like myself and forget about the chopped peanuts they include in the bag ",

I highly recommend Thai Elephant! A better than average delivery restaurant!",

This place was nearby so we stopped in, and there were only two other people dining in during the late lunch hour. Stopped in the bathroom to wash up and it was clean, smelled nice too.  We ordered Thai iced teas and they were delicious, price was fair too. Our waitress got us waters and we perused the menu, which had a lot of options. We decided to order two dishes and split them: pad Thai with tofu and red curry with tofu. Both arrived in a reasonable amount of time and the plates were generous. The curry was at a 3/5 spice level and it was good, and the noodle dish was 4/5 but not too spicy, which was good. They also offer double and triple Thai hot, so I could've bumped up the spice levels. Our waitress was wonderful and brought us extra plates since she heard we were sharing, so thoughtful. The curry was delicious, lots of veggies and strong flavor. The pad Thai was good as well, the noodles were a bit mushier than I'd like but it tasted good, not too sweet.  Generous portion sizes, variety of dishes, and great service. Thanks, Thai Elephant!",

I will say the Massaman curry was redeemable but the rice was mushy and overcooked. The pad Thai was completely bland and flavorless. The drunken noodle the same. They essentially served me plain rice noodles in oil. My husband and I just moved here and want to find our favorrite Thai - and this certainly wasn't it. I'm upset I wasted my money. Don't waste yours. I'm confused by the people giving it good reviews. Maybe they've never had good Thai and don't have the bar set very high? Took one or two bites of the noodles and threw it away.",

Overall, given the generous portions and healthy-sized shrimp/meat, the place deserves four stars. Enjoy your meal (and order everything mild unless you want spicy red pepper flakes throughout your food).   I used the delivery option, and it worked well.",

    "text": "Really enjoyed Thai Elephant. My wife and I love Thai food, especially a good Pad Thai dish. However, the places in Gilbert (where we live) and nearby Chandler leave a lot to be desired. Tempe has a much better selection, but its too far to drive. So when we are in the area and get a chance, we like to visit a new Thai place.   Thai Elephant was the random selection this time, and boy was it a good one. We did take out this time and both got Pad Thai. Her's was not spicy, mine was requested at Medium. Orders were quick and accurate, reasonably priced, and most importantly tasted great.   Thai Elephant is officially my favorite valley Thai restaurant.",

Their desserts which I have tried, are absolutely terrible. The only dessert worth having is the coconut ice cream. Their fish dishes with assorted seafood has some really crappy seafood in it. The scallops as well as the crab or lobster (I don't really know which one it is), are the only seafood that are worth having. The shrimp tastes like I got it out of a bulk bag and its been frozen for a long time. AKA not fresh. I cannot speak on behalf of beef because I have not had any of the beef dishes. The chicken is good, but none of the meats or fish are top quality.  However I enjoy their food, don't get me wrong. I like their food for a last minute idea if I don't have anything planned and really just don't want to cook something for myself. Other than that I don't really view this place is an exciting place to take a date or a person to display the Thai food examples of Tempe. But if you're not trying to impress anyone, and you just want some food, this place has good food for your dollar.  My favorite part about this place is that you can call in an order and you can pick it up, I think I've only sat down at this restaurant once. It is not that they don't have a good restaurant atmosphere, actually quite the opposite I think the atmosphere is really nice. But like I said before, I only use this place as my last minute decision I don't feel like cooking for myself and I would like some good food.",

Portions were fairly large and I had leftovers which is rare.   I asked for extra spicy and they delivered on that! I didn't even have to use the extra chili sauce.

Was given nicely seasoned mushy rice. Fried rice means it's fried not just white rice with soy sauce. Told the waitress I didn't want it. I was still charged for it. They lady began arguing with me about why she still has to charge me. Food cost and small business can't afford to throw away shrimp. WTF does that have to do with how poorly it was cooked and why do you feel like it's my fault. She said they will remake But honestly I just didn't want it.

I was working for a few hours and could only take a couple bites at a time, and when I finished it several hours later, the last room-temperature bite was just as good as the first freshly-made hot bite.  That's a great test of absolutely excellently-flavored and well-prepared food.  Today, I made the huge mistake of ordering what turned out to be extremely disappointing fried rice with vegetables and chicken at a closer Thai place instead of making the drive to Tempe.

The spring rolls were 90% breading and 10% spicy delicious something I wish they'd put more of in the roll. Go to Oregano's down the street for superior calamari. I had a Thaitini, which was fruity and not-too-strong. A good or bad thing, depending on your mood and palate, but I actually wish it had been a bit stronger. The g/f had the \"ginger binger\" which was actually my fav. thing we got. A ginger beer mixed with rum and/or vodka...what an idea!

I got the drunken noodles with chicken -- MILD, based on a handful of the reviews here -- and it was excellent. Not too spicy, but still with a little kick to remind you you're eating Thai. The flavor was great and the lunch portion was perfect. The veggie roll you get with the special isn't anything to write home about, but that's okay. Not that important, but the mints you get here are those awesome melt-in-your-mouth chalky mints you always get at weddings. I made sure to snag a small handful of them.  The restaurant itself is very clean and you can definitely tell you're in Tempe, because all I saw working there were college-aged kids, mainly women. They were all pretty friendly and the transaction was brisk.   Prices were definitely reasonable for a working lunch. My only (sort of) negative is that the parking is weird. There's no lot facing University, so you have to pull into a side-street and into a back lot that took a little tiny bit of snooping to find. Not huge deal, though.",

But the food was what I wanted and expected, service was good I asked for an opinion on the curry and the waiter happened to agree with everything I asked.  \"how about this is this good, YES he would reply\" made me wonder if he had tried it all.  Beer and wine are both served.  I liked this place and will return.",

    "text": "went here for my birthday since we had heard it was very good and Thai is my all time favorite food. very disappointing. The iced tea was like water and the water was awful. The table was grimy. The calamari had a thick crunchy coating- reminding me of frozen clams from tv dinners when I was kid. ( we love fried calamari when very light and you can actually taste the calamari.) Green papaya salad one of my favs was bland and only had 2 shrimp which were dry and tasteless. The entrees were better... We had Pad Thai which would have been great except it had that boiled rubbery tasteless shrimp in it. We also ordered green curry with tofu and veggies. It was sweet and spicy which I love, but the sauce was sooo thick. We both had belly aches and felt overstuffed, which never happens to me with Thai, even when I eat too much. We still do not feel that great the next morning.  On the positive, the wait staff was attentive and the service was fast, although there were only 3 tables of customers. Too bad.... still hunting for the best Thai in the Valley. So far I love Wild Thaiger.",

The time window was surprisingly broad at 10-35 minutes, but the food was ready in about ~30 on a Tuesday (so totally reasonable; just give them a call and they'll give you a more specific time). We had the Thai sausage appetizer, Siamese Basil with Chicken, and Thai BBQ chicken. The sausage was interesting and spicy and quite unlike anything I've had. The dish inexplicably came with roasted peanuts and ginger. The taste was great but the ginger and peanuts didn't make any sense. This dish might be better served as lettuce wraps or with some thought behind it rather than as a plate of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. The BBQ chicken was three decently sized thin chicken breasts and Rice. I wish it had included some green veggies (other than the leaf lettuce garnish) but fortunately we shared the dishes and I got my veggie fix from the Siamese Basil dish. We ordered both dishes with Medium spice, which added a comfortable but flavorful heat and there were plenty of fresh and diverse veggies in the Basil dish. Overall, this is on the better end of the Thai takeout I've had and we'll probably be back.",

I think it's too much protein because the crazy beef salad came with lots of beef and a few leaves of roman lettuce. I really liked the crazy beef salad the flavor was great.

    "text": "Thus far the best Thai food I have come across here in Arizona.  I have now visited a few times and have enjoyed the Chicken Panang Curry, Tom Kha Soup, and Drunken Noodles with Tofu.  I have found the \"spiciness\" scale to be accurate and tend to go for medium, but went for hot today being a little chilly and rainy out.  Their ingredients are fresh, the vegetables still have some bite to them, the chicken was tender and the tofu was delicious!  Also if you have a taste for it, the Thai Iced Tea is a very nice complement to their dishes.  I have only been here for dinner, but the portions were generous and I had plenty to take home for lunch the next day.  Be prepared if you order a \"bowl\" of soup because it is definitely a bowl that is meant to be shared.  The plating was well done and the dishes are fresh, hot, colorful, flavorful, and haven't disappointed me.  The service has been strong every time.  The decor is trying to be contemporary, but still has a comfy feel to it and most importantly clean.  I do agree that the decor with the Thai theme, but attempting to be a little more \"crowd pleasing\" (for lack of a better term) with the rock music and televisions make it a little... odd ambiance wise.  I look forward to going back and trying some of their other offerings and perhaps even the happy hour for some apps!",

When they asked how hot I wanted my green curry chicken, I did a double take. \"Isn't green curry spicy by definition?\" They told me they make it in varying degrees of spiciness for the ASU crowd. While I disagree with diluting the authenticity of the traditional preparation, I get it - they have a business to run. What I really don't like is how they do it. They make a mild green curry...er, no, green sauce. Then, upon ordering, they add a certain amount of red chili flakes depending on how spicy you want it. This is not only upsetting philosophically, but chili flakes need time to cook in a curry - you don't just drop in, stir and serve. I get the sense that this problem is rampant in Arizona; hope to find a solution soon.",

The restaurant was clean, staff was friendly, and the food was quick and tasty.  I tried the Elephant Garlic with chicken.  All the veggies were super fresh and still crisp, and the chicken had no suspicious looking or \"discard\" pieces in it, as Ryan C likes to say.

My belief after eating at yuphas was that fried rice could be executed no more skillfully than yupha her(him?)self did it. But thai elephant has kicked it up yet another notch.   I get the drunken fried rice, add egg, which includes typical fried rice but adds jalapeno and probably something else I'm forgetting. It delivers a savory and delectable punch that leaves me reeling with delight. By the time I get back to work, I feel a sensation that only the most brain-Noneifying postcoital stupor could deliver.   Now I have had a crappy day but that feeling gnawing at my insides is a longing, a *desperation* for thai elephant and the thrills that that only drunken fried rice can impart.

I decided this was one of my new regular places.   Their Pad-Z-U was really good, I love this dish and usually ordered it. I also usually ordered the Eggplant and a rice dishs.  The last time I ordered my 3 dishes to go, and each dish tasted exactly the same, and they all tasted bland. I was really surprised, normally each dish has such great flavor and tasted different. I am not sure if it was just an unlucky day or if the quality of food has gone down.   But sorry Thai Elephant you lost me as a fan!

They have lots of options on the menu and all dishes come with a choice of tofu/chicken/beef/pork/seafood.   My first vote goes to Red/Green/Yellow/Panang curries. The veggies are awesome, and consistency of the curries is just right..not too thick, not too watery...and sooooo yummy!   These are some of my second-favorites: Spicy eggplant,  Thai BBQ chicken,  Imperial veggies, Hawaiian Lover,  Thai elephant fried rice,  Drunken fried rice, Pineapple fried rice, Madness duck, Ruby curry fish  I will keep adding to the list as I try more dishes :)   The prices are affordable, portions are generous, and the place is not super classy but pretty neat and clean. Whenever I crave for thai food, Thai elephant is my first and last choice. I stopped going to other thai places in Tempe after discovering this one. Love it!",

It's a little too far away for ASU students to get to by walking, which is a shame as I would have eaten there all the time as a student if it were closer! The restaurant is decorated in a subdued, sleek and modern way and doesn't scream \"typical Thai restaurant.\" The furniture is dark and glossy and there are tasteful art pieces on the walls of mostly nature scenes.  We were seated immediately around 6:30 pm on a Wednesday night. The waitress came by to take our drink orders and I got a Thai iced tea. It came a few minutes later and was huge! The tea was strong, cold and delicious. We came during happy hour which was kind of unusual for me to see in a Thai place, but I definitely would have ordered something off the appetizer menu if I weren't trying to be healthy (most of the appetizers appeared to be fried). Maybe next time!  I ordered the rad nar, a noodle dish that has chicken, a whole bunch of vegetables (broccoli, carrots, onions, cabbage and some other stuff) and a light brown gravy type of sauce. It cost $9.95 or so. The dish was very generous in size and overflowing with vegetables and chicken. The veggies were fresh and crisp, not overdone at all, and the chicken was moist, all white meat cut into uniform slices. There was a subtle spiciness due to my ordering it at a medium level of heat, but nothing overpowering. The noodles were plentiful and wonderfully flavored, but there was a lot of gravy so they were kind of hidden. As in, so much gravy you couldn't even see them, and the gravy was perilously close to sloshing right over the edge of my plate onto the table. No big deal, I just pushed the extra gravy around so I could get to the noodles.   My friend ordered the papaya salad. It was also a generous portion and she asked for it with tofu instead of shrimp, which the kitchen happily did. There were lots of chunks of semi-firm tofu. The salad was crunchy, brightly flavored and a good enough size that my friend shared it with her boyfriend and both were satisfied.  More than half of my dish was left so I asked for a box. The waitress kindly boxed it up for me at the table. I had the leftovers today for lunch and it was another full meal's worth of food, plus the noodles had absorbed all that extra gravy overnight so it was even tastier today than it was yesterday.  All in all it was a good experience and I will gladly go back. Service was fast and pleasant, the restaurant is clean and sleek looking, and the food was awesome. The rad nar was the best I have ever had and the dishes were reasonably priced as well. My favorite Thai place is still Swaddee because, well, it's closer and they have really affordable dinner specials (maybe something Thai Elephant should try? I'm sure it would appeal to all the nearby cash strapped college kids) , but if I am ever in the area of Thai Elephant I will definitely try it again.",

It was different then what I expect when a Thai restaurant says Thai BBQ chicken. It really was more like two big pieces of chicken satay.

    "text": "The naming of Asian themed restaurants is in need of a serious makeover. I think this is the next frontier for marketing gurus; a potential fortune could be made here. Most restaurants fall into the category of being painfully bland (\"China Food\"), vaguely insulting ethnic caricatures (\"Mr. Yings' Happy China Meal\") or horrific puns (\"Pho Sure\"). Names like these don't inspire a lot of confidence in the quality of their food, even though that's not always the case (for example, \"China Food\" was actually pretty good).  So when I saw Thai Elephant, my mind immediately reversed the name which sounds suspiciously close to a parasitic disease (elephantiasis). Plus the fact that it's located in a strip mall is a bit of a red flag. But a growling stomach can overcome these biases and so I pulled into the lot......  ......And was pleasantly surprised. This is actually pretty good Thai food. The inside is a little more ornate than you would have expected; there's the whitewashed walls that fits the strip mall theme, but the furniture is darker wood with slightly dimmed background lighting. A large screen TV was playing the Suns game in the back room and a small bar is present in the front part of the restaurant. There are a few tables as well as some seats with a mix of wooden booths and chairs.  Still wary, I ordered the hot tea, Thai sweet potatoes and chicken Pad Thai. All of these were above average: the Thai sweet potatoes were perfectly fried and mixed well with the slightly tangy sauce. I may have eaten more than ten times my body weight in Chicken Pad Thai over the years, and this was definitely above average.   Although I was just here for dinner, I did see that they have a Happy Hour which runs from 5-7 pm.   All in all, it's a pleasant place that belies its' strip mall exterior and is worth a visit for respectable Thai food.",

My friend sitting next to me got the beef chow mein which smelled delightful but since I've given up beef, didn't get a chance to try. Had a bit of my friend's pineapple fried rice (?) which was interesting, personally not my thing. There was also a curry dish and the ran dar (?) which I heard were good. I myself had the medium chicken pad thai (original I know). My friend wasn't kidding when he said they were pretty serious about their spices. I got the medium (mild - medium - spicy), which was pretty kickin'. And they also provided some sricha (?) for my Mexican friend who thought he could handle more hot but couldn't, haha. Anyways, my pad thai was out of this world. At first bite, I thought, is this what I wanted? And then I couldn't stop eating. It was delish. I have a box of leftovers in my fridge that I can't wait to eat later.   The service was great, although we got our water glasses refilled a MILLION times. Great servers!

I have gotten a level 5 Thai Hot spicy many times, although my mother reminded me that I was sweating throughout our last dinner there together so I opted for a 4 on this visit. I could see flakes of red chilis, but couldn't taste much spice at all. My mother, who got no spice, and my father, who got a 2, reported no discernible differences in their dishes. I was disappointed but still really enjoyed everything. it's not often you'll get me to eat chunks of carrots.   Crab rangoons are impossible to screw up. The sweet & sour sauce with these ones has an interesting vinegar taste to it. The chicken satay was dry and didn't have much flavor apart from the thick-textured peanut sauce accompanying it.   The four of us ordered Sapporos. Mine was the only one that continued to bubble and maintain a head, and as a result, tasted flat. Leads me to believe their cleanliness standards behind the bar are less than desirable.",

Noodles were completely broken, bloated and no flavor to them besides the spice. I love spicy but disliked how it was the only flavor the dish had. The meats were all over cooked a d tough to chew.

I love pad see yu, and this one didn't disappoint. Their spice level is extremely mild. But I assumed in advance and asked for extra chili sauce on the side which they were super willing to accommodate. Oh, and the portion was huge.  -  Coconut ice cream. They packaged this separately, and it was delivered in tact! It wasn't quite what I was expecting, had a fair bit of (fresh and really good) honey added to it. There was enough ice cream for a family of 4.   Overall, had a great experience and would definitely be up for eating there again if I have a Thai craving.",

However, tonight it was amazing and these folks achieved curry nirvana.  I started my meal with a lycheetini which was delicious.  Had a glass of crisp chardonnay with the curry.  Left content.  Atmosphere was fine, nothing fancy.  Service was fine.  Prices were a steal.  Will I eat here again?  Tomorrow if possible is the answer.  this is my new Thai go to place in Phoenix.",

As a matter of fact, I'd recommend going out of your way for food from Thai Elephant vs any other Thai in the Valley, even if it may be closer to home.  I highly recommend the Green Curry and the fresh rolls, although I haven't had anything from Thai Elephant that I didn't like.  I'm definitely a fan of this place and I'm craving it now just thinking about it!",

I got two noodle dishes and a soup, and none of them had the delicious flavor that is what draws me to Thai food, they were all three pretty bland. The dish that I ordered \"Thai hot\" did have some spice to it, but it lacked any other flavor.   I seriously debated going through the condiments in my fridge to see if I had anything to pour on it to make it taste like something, and I NEVER do that with good Thai food. The portions were large which was kinda nice I guess, but I will not go back. If you want Thai food that actually has flavor in Tempe, go to Yupha's Thai Kitchen.",

The green tea ice cream looked like old, brown guacamole and was inedible.

I have been here a few times now and felt that it is time to give a review.  I am big on going to a place at least three times unless the first time was just horrible.  By far the BEST Pad Thai with Chicken I have ever had.  There is just the right amount of food. Not to little, and not to much.  The chicken was cooked just perfect.  Make sure to get a Thai tea, NO MATTER WHAT.  You may or may not like it on the first sip, and it takes a few sips to get used to the flavor, but it is delicious.  (tastes NOTHING like regular tea)  If you are in the mood for curry, then you cant go wrong with the red or yellow curry, both make my mouth water just thinking of them.  This place is a little slow on getting the orders out, but, it is because it is so busy that you cant really complain.  Just be patient if it is taking a little longer than normal because the food is well worth the wait.",

The price was decent and I even had delicious leftovers to take home.",

I'm also out to sample the massamun curry (cinnamon and clove-based curry with potatoes and onions) at each Thai restaurant in the area. Their's is by far the best I've had (as of yet).

    "text": "Having recently moved from the Bay Area, I had ignorantly thought that there wouldn't be any decent ethnic, especially asian ethnic, food. Thankfully, I am completely wrong! Elephant Thai is a good thai place with a varied menu, freshly made food, and nice atmosphere. An added plus to the Tempe location was that they allowed us to bring our small pooch to the patio area where we dined. We did have the corn cakes, which were ok. I don't remember them being bad or great...but my husband likes corn a lot, and I think he enjoyed them more than me. The green papaya salad was as close  in flavor to the papaya salad we had freshly made for us on the beaches of Thailand as I'd expect around here. We also had the thom ka soup which was really tasty. It was a while ago, so I can't remember the entrees we got. I probably got the pad thai...just to try it, and some kind of meat dish. I definitely don't remember anything being awful...and although it might not have been exceptional food, it was enjoyable. Thai ice tea was yummy, and my husband had the limeade which was too tart for me, although he thought it was really sweet and quite good. I do remember that for 2 people, what we ordered was a huge amount of food that we had no chance of finishing, and yet the final bill was quite reasonable.   We weren't able to order any dessert, but I did notice that they had the sticky rice w/ mango on the menu. It probably wasn't in season anyways, but I will definitely be ordering that at some point. This will definitely be one of our go to thai places.",

Very comfortable space, lighting is good so you can see each other & your food which is not always the case. The decor is not overwhelming but extremely comfortable, some TV's, Thai decor & more pop music on the overhead. The staff was extremely attentive from the moment we walked in through out the meal. My Jasmin iced tea never got to the bottom. The menu has great variety. The pad Thai was excellent as were the vegetarian rolls. The Tom Ka soup was excellent. Every member of our group got something different and they were all extremely happy. We will be back. Pricing was very reasonable. There is patio seating available. Check it out.",

We came here based on yelp reviews alone, and that can be risky since the boy and I are vegan and was just trying to find a place to eat  using my phone. I am very glad I found this place with the <a href=\"http://yelp.com\">yelp.com</a> iphone app!   The restaurant was nice and clean and  we were seated immediately. The waitress was so sweet and very helpful.  We first asked the waitress if the veggie rolls were vegan and she said yes so we ordered them as an appetizer. When she came back to take the rest of our order she asked if everything else needed to be vegan and we said yes so she wrote \"VEGAN NO OYSTER SAUCE\" huge across the top of the bill. The fact that she even asked us, and made sure to make it clear that we wanted our food vegan is very impressive.  We ended up ordering the pineapple fried rice, and the imperial veggie, and something else I can't remember, and all were super delicious!    Thai Elephant has good food, great prices (1/2 off happy hour appetizers!), and great service. Next time I'm in AZ I will definitely go back!",

The food was good and I learned that Thai Elephant is owned by the same family who runs Thai Basil just down the road. Their menu was quite large and although the lunch specials were decently priced we ventured off an had the Seafood Tofu. It was great, the portion was generous and they did not skimp on the seafood - there were mussels, octopus, shrimp and scallops. The tofu in the dish was awesome, fried to perfection and incredibly firm, this with crisp sugar snap peas, carrots and onions all served in a garlic brown sauce. We both had Thai tea (although I am not sure why I always order this ad Thai resturants, I don't like it - way to sweet) and it was a nice balance to the spiciness of the dish. I will definitely be returning to try the other dishes that were jumping out at me on the menu.",
