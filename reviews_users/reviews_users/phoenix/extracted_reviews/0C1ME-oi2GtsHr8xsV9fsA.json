I got the beef pho & you can tell it doesn't have any MSG- it's not salty at all so a bit surprising at first but it's way better!! The owner is super friendly and walks around table to table chatting with customers. She was hugging the regulars and taking time to get to know people. Best part- it's BYOB! I highly recommend this restaurant!",

I sat down anyway, on their hard, uncomfortable plastic chairs (seriously, the decor is very cafeteria like), and started to look over the menu. Pho for $10?? It better be some amazingly good pho! So I sat and I sat, waited and waited. The server/owner/manager/whoever that greeted me when I walked in had gone in the back and after waiting 10 minutes I decided to just leave. Give me a break. There is NO ONE in the place. I'm your ONLY customer and you're going to just let me sit there forever? No thanks. Went to my usual go-to for pho at Pho Van and had an awesome lunch.",

And by \"forgotten,\" I mean, they didn't bring out our food until we reminded them we existed.  Yes, the greens and food were fresh. However, calling this place a Vietnamese restaurant would be comparable to calling Taco Bell a Mexican restaurant.  We didn't care so much about the price as long as the food was good.

In fact, I would like to go there today! I love the Lemongrass chicken, spicy beef salad, Seafood Pho, and the garlic green beans.    I absolutely love the food, and the only reason it doesn't have five stars is the service. It's not terrible and they've never screwed up my order or anything, but it's not the greatest I've ever had. I recall waiting a few minutes with an empty water glass before I could resume eating because I was thirsty. I'd rather wait for a refill than not eat at this restaurant though.  One thing to keep in mind, this place is small, and it gets busy, so if you don't want to wait for a table, go at an off time like during the week or for lunch. Dinner time on Friday or Saturday night fills up pretty quick!",

    "text": "I was told tonight that every person from Vietnam has a story.  Justina's is all about personalized service, oh, and a rough journey from North Vietnam to Los Angeles, by way of Hong Kong.  Some people may not like her or her style.  I thought she was funny and worked hard to live up to her claim that her food has a secret ingredient, love.  I tasted another ingredient, fun.  I'm not Vietnamese, but I have a story about tonight.  I met a good friend of mine while here on business who had worked with a lady in Tucson who recommended her cousin Justina's restaurant in Phoenix.  When we told our server of this recommendation, the menu was snatched away and we were given \"owner's choice\".  Not bad.  The Green Papaya salad was excellent, the heat tempered nicely with the Thai Iced Tea.   The shrimp on the side of the salad was also very tasty.  The Pork Short Ribs were next.  They were very tender with a subtle BBQ sauce, slightly sweet and all good.  A beef or pork (not sure) and rice dish came next and it was also very good.  The meat was tender and again, subtly spiced.  Not hot though.  The main dish, a mix of vegetables, scallop, shrimp and beef was less impressive.    Finally, the dessert (not something I usually do) was excellent.  As another reviewer pointed out, they are a little known sensation.  I had the creme brulee (jasmine? not sure, but very, very good) and the mango with sticky rice (covered with coconut milk).  The Vietnamese coffee was also very good.  It is allowed to drip at the table, mixed with the sweetened cream in the bottom of the glass, then poured over ice.  It's strong and full of flavor.  I may be up all night.  Oh, and as for price, this all came in at $58 for both of us.  I don't know if this is reasonable, high or cheap.  It ain't bad in general.  Those of you who do Vietnamese often will have make the call.  I'm not in Phoenix often, but I will return to try some of the other menu items (Pho and other noodles for sure).",

The food is good and some of my favorites are the green papaya salad, Pad Thai, and Suon Non.    Bring a six pack of a nice Asian beer if you are going because it is BYOB.

Maybe I missed it, but I scanned that menu like a detective looking for clues and didn't see it. That aside, the owner is a whole different story. This woman was one of the FUNNIEST people I've ever met. If she set up a microphone in her restaurant and did stand up, I would be in the front row. She was very attentive and made sure we were happy. We will be back and maybe I'll stray from my usual to try other options on that menu. I do think people should go to at least have a conversation with the owner over their beautiful pomegranate and lemongrass water.",

The food makes a place good, but the atmosphere and people make a place great-- and this place is great.

Yes the food is expensive - especially for lunch, but the food is great, full of flavor and portions are large - I always take 1/2 my vermicelli home. Plan on $20 per person.  Yes the service can be a little slow but the BYOB policy and casual atmosphere make up for that (although, the chairs are a little uncomfortable).  I love this place and we keep going back for all it is and all it isn't. One time we didn't realize they close for a couple hours in the afternoon and walked in for a special celebration just a couple minutes before they closed, they put our beer and wine in the fridge served us and told us to take our time...they are good to their customers.  Check it out but be prepared for what it is.  Also, it's small and gets packed!",

I'm always game for a place that serves tasty Asian food and does not feel like a cafeteria.  On the contrary, the restaurant is chic.  The food is reasonably authentic, and I mean that in a good way.  Authentic enough that I got my VN fix.  The nuoc mam is flavorful without being overpowering.  The seasoning of the food is well done.  The feel of the dishes is authentic with a little bit of fusion.  Little Dining Partner had the pho tai and really enjoyed it.  Dining partner and I had maybe six of the small plate items (salad/goi, pepper shrimps on toasts, spring rolls/chai gio, etc etc); everything was tasty.  We enjoyed the watermelon slices in the water.  We also loved that it was BYOB.  We're coming back to Phoenix for the holidays.  I'm certain we will be coming to Cyclo again.",

That's her personality and it is part of what you get at cyclo. We go there once a month and find the food to be consistently good. One thing we'd like to see some new dishes once in a while. Our kids love the rolls and lemongrass chicken - sure bet. They have internet access, good for me if I have to do emails. Decor is great however I am not fond of the patio chairs. We can bring our own wine at no extra charge, which is a plus. The music is Ok, ambience and at least it doesn't hit you on the head like brick - like sushi room or postino. Cleanliness Ok. I know they once had issues with inspectors finding dead roaches - but we're giving them a chance. Service - when Justina isn't there is lacking. The waiter walks around with his iPod and not really paying attention. I've never seen this in my entire life. This is a big negative. Overall, we find this to be a superior Vietnamese restaurant compared to others in the Phoenix area. Most are downright awful so the bar isn't that high. In the end, they do score some points.",

Seems to me that some folks happen to go to Cyclo when their low mental cycles coincide with low points for the restaurant and others manage to coincide their highs.  Either that or too many cranky people are going to a great place.  That said, we just got back from meeting out of town relatives at Cyclo, which has become a tradition.  Don't understand the complaints about the decor or the service.  I do understand the differences in reactions to the food since in our party of five, there were definite differences.  The pork chop and the crispy noodle cake were thumbs down, with the verdict rendered on the noodles because it was impossible to tell apart the different types of protein that were supposed to be served with it.  Two had the mint chicken which was given an OK, although the broken rice was a bit plain for both eaters' tastes.  I had the Hanoi vermicelli and it was to die for.  Incredible broth, perfectly grilled meat, great herb accompaniment.  So folks, it all boils down (pardon the pun) to what you order.  By the way, heard no f-bombs from the owner who was her delightfully sassy self as well as being an efficient server and a really snazzy dresser.  Friday night and the place was at capacity.  Still on my list of places to go back to, even if all too infrequently.  BTW, all those complaints about the pricing were just silly.  It's not 1952 any more.",

I know for most it is only important if the food is good but the way I am treated in a restaurant and the ambience is also important.  I am american and vietnamese is new to me.  I am still learning how to figure out what everything is on the menu.  I had a dish of beef, shrimp and scallops with veggies over a fried noodle patty.  I forgot what it is called!  It sounded strange to me but was amazing!  I did not care for the black pepper shrimp appetizer too much but cannot wait to dine her again!  It was a great experience:)",

At one point she spotted my date struggling with the pho (combined with my unmanly failure to assist her, since I'm pretty incompetent with pho myself), and jumped in to give her a little hands-on tutorial on how to combine the spoon with the chopsticks to scoop out the crab meat from the legs, swirl up the noodles and slurp it all up. By the way, we did request forks on no less than 3 separate occasions. They were promised but never came. All is forgiven because of the tutorial, though. Not to mention the food was tasty (we shared two dishes: the seafood pho and the Bun Bo Xao) and the ambiance was as cozy and charming as one would hope for a nice little date night. We brought our own wine, which the server chilled for us in their fridge. A pleasant experience throughout.",

    "text": "Let me preface by sharing that I am a Vietnamese who have eaten Vietnamese food on five continents the past 15 months and I have to crown Cyclo as a gem!  Who would have guess it would be in Chandler, AZ?  For the quality and the price, you cannot beat it. I noticed a reviewer noted the price was higher than expected, but I sense the reviewer is not familiar with the finer details of the dishes which foodies won't mind paying for at a restaurant.  For example, you can order a bowl of pho at any VN restaurant, but they often only give you basil instead of the other fragrant herbs that should accompany a bowl of pho.   At Cyclo, they don't cut corners so the dishes come out complete with the love and attention as if you are family. I have to admit, my favorite dish there is the crepe. It's perfectly prepared so that the edges are crispy and the crepe itself is not doughy. But what separate it from other crepes is that Cyclo correctly includes all the fresh herbs that should accompany this dish. Most restaurants just give you some cilantro and lettuce to go with the crepe, but Cyclo gives you the complete experience!  It's analogous to eating mushroom risotto at an Italian restaurant with a shaving of aromatic truffle vs just a shake of pepper on top.  It's all in the details!  I enjoy the food so much I have been stopping by there for dinner when ever I am in town on business. My friends can't believe it because I generally tend to prefer restaurants with a 10 course tasting menu where I can linger for 2-3 hours each night enjoying my dinner.  The quality of the food at Cyclo must be good or I wouldn't be wasting my time there.  Besides, if you are trying to get the best bang for your dollar, this is definitely the place to eat.  The quality exceeds the price here.  I am trying to make my way down the menu and so far I have not been disappointed.  But my favorites are the crepes, the short rib appetizer, goi cuon (summer rolls), lemongrass chicken, and stir-fried string beans. The latter is full of flavor and your taste buds will appreciate it.   Generally, I don't order desserts at Vietnamese restaurants, but I always finish my dinner here with one of the house made desserts.  Creme Brulee was the correct texture which is important to me.  I typically won't order tapioca dessert because I think they are boring, but I was making my way down the menu so I took their suggestion and ordered it last time.  I am happy to report the tapioca dessert here was a few notches above the usual tapioca dessert so I will order it again next time. When in season, you can also order mango and sticky rice for dessert.  Yes, I have tried them all and can vouch for them.  Oh, one warning though: the at-your-table drip-coffee is very addictive and very strong.  It really rounds out the meal nicely but you will be up for a while with that boost of caffeine!  Incidentally, the best part of Cyclo is not just the food, but the warm service with a smile.  All must come together to create the perfect meal!  Cyclo is now a gem in my back-pocket.  I look forward to my next business trip to AZ so I can stop by again!",

I was kind of embarrassed by the service.  The food is consistently good as is the lemonade.  Their new decor is nice also.  But they really fell flat on their face with their service.  It seems like the waitress only takes the food orders, one of the cooks brought out the food so of course he don't know who gets what, they brought mine first, then a few minutes later my boyfriend got his and then our friend got her food.  When we finished eating we had half of our food left over that we were going to take home.  We asked her for boxes and she proceeded to stack all our plates on top of each other.  She brought our check and my boyfriend told her that we wanted to take our food home and she says \"sorry, I didn't hear you\" and left it at that.  We were disappointed and won't be back which is a shame.",

Had the Chicken Noodle pho and although tasty, never really figured out what the fuss is all about. I believe you can get that same style pho (that tastes as good) in other Vietnamese restaurants across the valley. Prices aren't cheap either. Maybe I'm biased due to the fact that I had to wait for about 90 minutes (yes, you read correct - an hour and half) before I was seated. This place probably seats about 30 people max so that doesn't help either. Also noticed that this is a BYOB(eer)/W(ine) establishment. One positive thing that I noted was that the owner (figured her name is Justina after reading a few reviews here) was extremely friendly and interacted with all the customers making them feel very welcome. Rare to find such service these days. Would definitely not go back for the food, but might consider going back for the friendly service.",

He gives me a shifty look, which I didn't understand. I Immediately get it once I make my way in and look at the toilet. Didn't even put the seat up. Piss everywhere. I was so mad. Unfortunately, the bill was paid and he was tipped by the time I came out. F'n disgusting.

    "text": "I was having a frustrating day at work and couldn't care less about getting back to work late from lunch.  Pho had been on my mind heavily at that time, and I decided to indulge.  I read up on some places in Chandler, and this was the closest one to the job. This was a while back, but from what I can remember, the pho was good-not the best-but good.  They gave me all the fixins, the broth was just right, meat was tender, and the noodles were cooked just so.   The service was...interesting.  I won't say its bad, its just very non-chalant.  Kinda breezy.  I'll leave it at that.  And since service is so important to me, I had to give the place 3 stars.   The decor and actual building don't garner a comment from me.  I couldn't see anything anyway after the steam from my pho clouded my glasses up.   What can I say?  I went there for pho and got satisfied.  Not the best I had, but it hit the spot.  The menu looked like it had some awesome stuff on it though, however the prices aren't the greatest.  Honestly, I should try this place again and review it afterwards.  One visit won't give you the full flavor of any place, and this one seems like it has more to offer than what I required from it. Give it a try.",

One coworker loves this place.  He also says he was kicked in the head by the owner with her 5 inch heels and she threw trash at him.  Another coworker believes she is so rude that he will never go back.  I think the consensus between most of them is that the food is good and the owner gives a good performance. My friend and I did not receive a special performance but she does dress to impress in small tropical outfits.",

Cyclo has both, and Justina makes dining an absolute pleasure.  We have been dining at Cyclo for 3 years and it is definitely one of my top five restaurants in the Phoenix metro area. Cyclo does not serve alcohol but has a BYOB policy that makes going out to dinner a whole lot less expensive.  I highly suggest eating here as it is one of the better restaurants that I have experienced.",

The first time they were closed for renovations, and finally got back there last week.  The \"Thai Iced Tea\" wasn't very good - it wasn't thick enough, even a little better.  I had the Pho Hai San.  It was good but not very much seafood - but not bad for $10.  My co-worker got the Com Tam - which was good.  A couple others got various Phos, they're Vietnamese pros and I'd say on average we probably would give this place a 6 (1-10).  The owner had a tongue in cheek way about her, was funny at times but went a little too far at others.  Anyway - been meaning to write this review for a while now, but the buzz around the office this morning is about a recent health inspection.  We figured it was BEFORE the renovation, but it was AFTER!  Its really disgusting, and none of us will ever eat there again.  We're talking some serious stuff.  Food being stored in a broken fridge, and unsightly critters running over the FOOOD!!!!    I gave it a 2 because w/o the bugs I probably would give it a 3-4, maybe a 4 because of the low prices.  Maybe I'm naive and critters are in all restaurants but now that I've seen the report - no thanks.",

Well, judging from the lunch crowd, none of the people that eat there would know what it is anyway.  Not a Nguyen in the place other than the people running it.  (joke for those of you with Smith for last name!)  No big deal.  Pho Tai was very good, I love having green onions in the soup, but I doubt it is traditional.  The accessory bowl was short a few green items but all very fresh.  The broth very nice, though I think salty, but mmm, good.  Service was excellent.  Ambience different than I expected.  Small, quaint, clean, lots of awards on the wall, which I'm sure are well deserved.    The spring rolls were very tasty, though not traditional with dried pork, but the crispy and very yummy grilled pork and shrimp were delicious with the right hint of mint.  mmmm.  Very good peanut sauce to go with it, though I'm a fish sauce fan, which I didn't get to try THIS time.  Next time I will.  I also tried the preserved lemon soda.  Delicious!  I think if this place was close by, I'd eat here a lot.  A nice Pho can't be beat and I would love to give their other menu items a chance.",

I don't drink wine with my Pho so maybe that is a plus if you do. The people are friendly and the service was good. The Thai Iced tea was good too.",

The quality of the food has not dropped a single notch over the years, and I cannot get enough of the Lat Na! Her pho and lemongrass chicken are also delightful.  One of my favorite parts about Cyclo is that it's BYOB. Bring your own wine, she'll cork it and serve it up to you. Want to keep a second white cold while you wait for entrees? No problem, she'll put it in the fridge for you.  Yes, Justina is a bit of a firecracker with the mouth of a sailor. But you have to appreciate that she doesn't hide who she is, she'll remember your name (especially if you had the audacity to ask for a fork), and she will greet you with a smile when you come back again! Cheers to many more years Justina!",

I don't know what authentic Vietnamese food tastes like, but as far as I'm concerned, if this isn't authentic, then I don't want authentic. Fresh ingredients, good spices, and fun options.  Secondly, the atmosphere in here is modern and really fun.  Apparently a Cyclo is a type of Vietnamese bike-cart type thing piloted by skeletons, and they're all over the place, along with cool modern art.  Lastly and most importantly, the staff is really fun. When we came in, the lady who seated us and took our order (I think she's the owner) harassed us for taking too long to order, and then started hitting on one of my associates because he was from Utah and thus probably a polygamist to her. It was super fun.  I've been back only once since, but I can't wait to go again!",

Justina is there every time that we come to eat and she makes sure to go to each table to either take the order personally or just chat with the table and make sure every one is happy.  I recommend going and letting her \"surprise you\".  We have yet to actually order, everytime we go she picks our meal and I have yet to have the same thing twice.  Everything is AMAZING.  Absolutely Mouth watering.  Cyclo is BYOB so be sure to bring your favorite wine or beer and enjoy the best vietnamese cusine you have ever tasted! All the staff is attentive and friendly , the artwork is local and beautiful and the feel of the space is inviting, friendly and just happy.  I give it 10 stars!",

    "text": "If I could separate my review into two categories -- \"Food\" & \"Service\" -- the Food would probably rack up a couple more stars. It was good, no complaints at all. Not the best I've ever had, but very nice. Pricey? Yeah, a little ... but probably in the vein of \"you get what you pay for\"...   For me, the (unfortunate) star of my visit was the service. I can't complain about the promptness or the attentiveness - both were excellent (though I was only 1 of 2 in the restaurant for a rather late lunch that day). What I will complain about -- and what came THAT close to me simply walking out of the restaurant mid-meal -- was the over-the-top, offensive, completely-inappropriate, 4-letter-word-laced commentary by the owner that permeated my entire meal.   I see from other postings that the owner (Justine) seems to be a hugely-positive attraction for many other reviewers. Perhaps I got her on a bad day, or in the middle of an afternoon booze session, or perhaps my experience was especially noticeable due to being one of the only people in the restaurant? Regardless, I was certainly not impressed. It wasn't cute, sexy, or engaging. It certainly wasn't professional. I am not a prude by any means ... but I heard enough F-bombs, bigoted statements, hateful talk, and borderline racist comments during my 45 minutes there to negate any warm fuzzy feelings I had about what I was eating. Again, I read many reviews that shower praise and adoration for Justine, and I know this was just my experience and my personal opinion ... but I just must be in a different crowd.   Simply put, there isn't a bowl of Pho good enough to warrant sitting through this barrage ever again.",

Two friends/colleagues and I went there for lunch today; it was the first time for all of us.   The decor was bright, fun, and modern...from the clear plastic chairs, to the orange circles and abstract art on the walls. From the moment we walked in, the owner, Justina, catered to us, exchanged playful, witty, banter, and peppered her sentences with a healthy dose of f*ck, sh*t, and other \"fiery\" language. I loved it; it's exactly how I talk and interact with people I know.   She visited our table often. I didn't interpret this as an intrusion or her wanting to be \"besties\"; IMO opinion it was genuine attempt to provide attentive service and show us we were valued customers. I asked her how long she'd been operating the restaurant (12 years), where she moved from (CA), and what else she'd like to do in addition to or after the restaurant (I'll let you ask her and tell you herself).   The food was great (though, admittedly, I haven't had a lot of Vietnamese food. We had the spring rolls (the wrap was a bit chewy, so not the best I've ever had) and the Hanoi and Saigon Vermicelli (both of which were amazing: flavorful and fresh). Overall it was a very fun lunch experience and I will be returning to try other offerings. My friends concurred.  My recommendations: (1) Don't go there if you can't afford a $10-13 entree. That is *not* expensive and if you think it is maybe you stick to fast food and/or generic, cheap, run-of-the-mill places/chains; (2) Don't come with a stick up your butt. If you want to be \"alone\" with whoever you came with, maybe this isn't the place for you. Fine. Go find somewhere else where you can be antisocial. But, for those who'd like to expand their horizons and meet and talk to new, interesting people, have a convo with Justina; (c) If you're offended by swear words or don't appreciate acerbic wit, humor, and friendly banter, don't talk to the owner. In fact, don't come here at all. God forbid you get all butt hurt b/c someone said f*ck in public. We wouldn't want your meal to be ruined. Or next time BYOB and get drunk so you don't care as much about what others around you are doing or saying. For everyone else who likes a fun dining experience with good Vietnamese food, check out this place.",

Although I like Justine, I can see how some might be turned off by her. But for me, she would be the main reason for frequenting this place. I like friendly and engaging staff, and I believe in supporting local business.   But the food is not particularly special. I've been here twice, and the meals have had little impact.  I like the atmosphere so much that I went again, hoping to fall in love with the food, but it just isn't happening. The flavor is too mild. And it makes me sad.   Arizona severely lacks culture and general character, so I want to support these types of restaurants so more will pop up. I might keep trying. Maybe I need to find *THAT ONE* dish that knocks my socks off. Here's hoping.",

What a mistake!  First off, the food is horribly overpriced.  You can get a better bowl of pho at many other Vietnamese restaurants for half the price.  Taste wise, the pho was horrible.  It's all about the broth for a good bowl of pho, and it tasted like they just used beef broth from a can.  Additionally, the brisket smelled like it was spoiled.  Even my American co-worker thought the food tasted horribly.  This is the first time I have not left a tip at a restaurant.  It was that bad.  If you go to a Vietnamese restaurant and you don't see any Vietnamese people there, it should tell you something.",

The staff is so so funny, always enjoy the conversation that's not just small talk but they take an interest in their customers and pride themselves on being a relaxes and fun environment.   I personally love Pho Tai, I usually get this at every Pho restaurant we go to, and I love theirs! The beef is very tender and melts in your mouth. The spring rolls are also very yummy. Very fresh ingredients that are not made way in advance like others out there.  Even if we couldn't walk here from our home I'd still drive past many other restaurants to come here.",

Tried the pho, as I'm new to the area and on a pho hunt, and it was pretty good, but the portions are smaller than I'm used to and more expensive sadly. Pho broth was still 4 stars, good ratio of meat and noodles, fresh ingredients, can't complain. But if this is the best I can get in the area I'll take it! Wait staff is super friendly.",

I balked at the $10 price point for the base beef pho on the lunch menu ( I am very spoiled by my regular spot, Saigon Pho's $5.95 pho lol) but they did have some interesting choices for seafood phos for $13. There was a snow crab one I was eyeing...but decided to just go for the standard one.   It was a perfectly good pho, although I really missed having tripe and tendon. All in all, a fine meal in a very colorful, chic environment. Oh, it was nice to have some variety of fruit in my water--that was a nice touch!",

Unlike other restaurants justina can tell you exactly what's in the dish.  Justina, the owner is a True host. She gets to know all her customers but also give you space if you need it.   The service is impeccable. The water is always filled to the top in your glass. And the plates  cleared off the table when you're done. Speaking of water Justina puts fruit in her water and makes it naturally flavored with an essence of watermelon, mint, citrus or pomegranate seeds.  it's a True treat just to drink H2O. If you need it plain just ask!  People who eat at Cyclo are very friendly and I've sat there having a general conversation with complete strangers. Fun times.  And if you like beer or wine, bring it!

I'm not an expert on VN food, but we love the food here. The portions seemed a bit smaller, but I suppose it's that or raise prices. We usually get several small dishes - beef salad, spicy green beans always have lots of flavor. It's casual enough my kids - ages 5 and 7 can walk around checking it out with no problems.

A small place where the owner had their thumb on the pulse to ensure a really good experience.   Cyclo's was also B.Y.O.B. which added to the uniqueness of the joint. The only reason I stopped going is, we had tried all the appetizers, desserts and most of the entrees on the menu. And it is too expensive to be a place to go for a daily fix of noodles and water.

I ate here about a week ago and had their pho bowl and it was one of the best I have tried in the valley, I really loved it. The girl who seated us was really nice and gave an enjoyable contribution to the dining experience. Yes this place cost almost twice what I pay across town but worth it with the right company. My brother and I ate here and we both agreed we would probably not eat here together much but we will both be eating here again. AKA we thought this was alot better place to take a girl or a business associate than our fav pho in the area to have lunch together.  Cyclo has a more upscale atmosphere than the average pho and we both thought the food is above average. I don't agree with another reviewers post that the portions here are small. I had one appetizer with a pho bowl and left full.  I'm 6'3\" 230 and like to eat ALOT and my brother who is shorter but heavier than me was complaining he ate too much after we left. One of the best phos in the east valley!",

The lady owner only pays attention to 2 things: swagging around in her short skirt and cloking 4inch heels. The food was way too over priced for such a casual,average tasting restaurant (a bowl of beef pho for 13 bucks...Come on!) and the variety of dishes they offer was very Very limited.   The most annoying fact about this restaurant is that you cannot share certain food with others unless you pay 2 dollars extra! (written on their menu)   Save yourself from wasting time and money and head over to Da Vang for authentic, large, cheap Vietnamese cuisine.",

I then asked how she eats it:  a bunch of Sriracha and garlic...WOW!

The hostess/waitress/owner?? was very friendly and personable, at first; then a little *too* friendly and didn't seem to take the hint that we weren't into that much small talk.  Here's the best part:  when my mom ordered, she asked if she could please have a fork.  The h/w/o said, \"No.\"  Not even apologetically!  She said: \"Nope, you're going to learn to use chopsticks.\"  We laughed awkwardly -- ha, ha! -- and when the entrees came out, mom said, \"Seriously, can I please have a fork?\"  And again: \"No!\"  She didn't explain, and she didn't apologize.  We thought it was weird, but you know what, maybe they didn't have any forks, and mom did fine, and whatever.  BUT as we were paying our bill, we looked across the room, and there was a guy in his mid-twenties or so USING A FORK!!!!   Cyclo, why give some dude a fork and not a nice older lady who asks you politely TWICE??  If I had been there with my inlaws, you better believe they would have stormed the hell out in a hurry.  Don't know if I'll go again -- food was nice, but expensive, and I don't want to embarrass any future guests I might bring there.   So, BYOFork!",

As a Vietnamese from Saigon, just came here for school, I have to say Cyclo is the one that is clean, in good neighborhood and still has the most authentic Pho. In AZ, most \"authentic\" places, for some reasons, are either dirty or in sketchy neighborhood. The clean and nicely decorated ones tend to \"americanize\" Pho to please majority of patrons.  Other dishes are delicious, maybe a bit varied from being authentic, but still amazing: Pork Short Ribs, Crispy Rice Crepe, Green Papaya Salad (my fav, and pretty close to what you would find in Vietnam), Spicy Garlic Green Beans. At first I was surprised, and rather amused to find guests bringing wine here. I guess certain reviews molded this restaurant into a fine dining. While the place is quite chic, pairing wine with Vietnamese cuisine like the ones here is .... very very odd. Heineken beer perhaps, but wine? Better save that bottle for a French-Vietnamese fusion bistro. One thing about Cyclo that bothers me is they need to turn the AC lower. 3 out of 4 times I was there, our group ended up sweating.",

Sometimes I'm the only there w/o a badge.   My favorite here is the BYOB option.  The Pho is excellent, not $11 excellent but if I can drink my cabernet with my pho...hey no complaints here.  Spring rolls are the best I've had anywhere because the beef strips are actually grilled and it makes all the difference. The chili green beans and lemongrass chicken are signature dishes and are consistently well made.  They also made the food LIGHTENING fast which can make you feel rushed... because a nice bottle of red should never be rushed.

The food was spectacular, and the service was great.  It was affordable, and the owner wasn't quite as wild as we read.  She was energetic, but not overbearing.  We got there a little early, which was good because it got really busy later.    SPECIAL NOTE:  It's one of those rare places where you can bring a bottle of wine, or some beers if you want to.  There is probably some fee for it, but it would have made our date perfect.  We had the garlic green beans (I would have NEVER thought of eating a full plate of green beans could be so scrumptious) , the curry/pineapple chicken (yummy and not too sweet, and finely tuned), and the Bun Sai Gon (Saigon Rice Vermicelli)...  all were A+ dishes and had very intricate flavor combinations.  We had three dishes and the bill was about $25 after a healthy  tip.",

The owner, Justina, is a hoot and really keeps the place running smoothly.  And if you're there more than once, chances are she'll remember you.  Cyclo is a haul for me from Central Phoenix, so it's not a super regular stop for me, maybe once every 6-8 weeks.  But, Justina remembers me and chats with me.  That's great service.  Cyclo is another BYOB and, Lord knows, I love that.  No corking fee.  Now, this isn't fancy.  Paper napkins and plastic cups, but dang, it's good.    Faves include: Green beans.  These aren't your ordinary green beans, they're chili and garlic green beans and they make me want to be a vegetarian. Tamarind ribs.  On the app menu, they are so tasty and tender and tangy.  I wanna lick the plate, but that's not lady like. Lemongrass Chicken.  Lil' nuggets of lemongrassy love.  Chicken deep fried and infused with lemongrass.  So simple and delicious.  Everything we've had here is wonderful and calling it reasonable is a laugh, it's downright cheap.  We were four for dinner with apps and entrees and tea for $50.  That's a deal!  They are now open for lunch, but no lunch menu.  It's the same menu all day long.    No reservations and the wait can be long.  I suggest going at lunch time or for an early dinner or be prepared for wait for a bit.  On the same note, this isn't a place that you sit and linger after you've eaten.

My friend ordered the mixed grill.  The short ribs as I remember did not disappoint.  Succulently flavorful making me dream of taking a full order of them home just to smell in the car!  The crispy chicken had great flavor, but was a little over cooked.  (of course that didn't stop me from eating it.)  My friend really liked the mixed grill and loved the atmosphere.

I always start with the black pepper shrimp and since I've switched to a mostly vegetarian diet the past two years my choices have narrowed a bit, but Justina always modifies the food so it fits.   Over the years I've had pretty much everything on the menu and whenever a friend asks me what to get I say, \"Close your eyes and point, you won't be disappointed\".   The Vietnamese coffee at the end of dinner is a perfect ending to any meal.   The desserts are great and when I do get it I like the Mango Sticky Rice or the Creme Brulee. Both will not disappoint.   Justina is a great and I think it is funny when people take her too seriously. She has fun with her customers and they should have fun with her. She can take it as much as she can dish it out so just relax.   There have been some comments that when Justina is not there the experience is not the same. How could it be? There is only one Justina and once you get to know her you'll realize she is really much more than a crazy hostess. She is a really nice person.   I hope you enjoy Cyclo as much as I have.",

If I were to take the Dirty Dining aspect out of the review, I would recommend this place to people who are venturing out into Vietnamese cuisine.    The owner is very friendly and knows my sister and her friends pretty well.  Whenever we go in, she takes our bottle(s) of wine (gotta love the BYOB!) and immediately opens them up.  She chats with us for 10-15 min., and always takes our order.  When it comes to cozy atmosphere, this place is definitely at the top!  The reason I stated that this place is a good introduction to Vietnamese fare is that I personally felt that the flavors were more suited to a Westernized palate.  Their spicy chicken dish (the name escapes me!) is quite good, but reminds me of Orange Chicken: it's not Chinese-Chinese, but Chinese-style American!  Of course, the dish I always get is pho.  The broth is not as pungent as the broth you might get at the pho shop next to LeiLei's, but is savory and allows you to taste the basil and bean sprouts and lime you put in!  I give it 4 stars because of atmosphere, the very accommodating nature of the restaurant owner, and the general cuisine.  I don't give it 5 because of the essential nature of the pho itself.  To me, pho is the perfect hangover food.  The pho at Cyclo is light and perfect for dinner, but not for the morning after a rough night!",

Start with the pork and shrimp spring rolls, move on to the crisp lemongrass chicken or pad thai, end it with one of their unique desserts...and you have a meal that is sure to satisfy!   Beware the plum soda! LOL That's all I have to say about that...",

I had the spring rolls... those were okay.  I had their pho.  It was okay.  The thai tea was nice.  The wait staff was friendly... not the fastest, but having been around many many many Asian restaurants and their workers, I'm not going to care about the service as much as I do the food.  I felt the prices were a little high for what you get, too.  Do yourself a favor... have the pho or the barbecue at Yen Mi... and if you want really really really good pho and spring rolls... help yourself to a little hole in the wall on 19th Ave. called Da Vang.  HANDS DOWN the best pho on the planet.",

Spring rolls were perhaps the best I've ever had. My Saigon bowl was very tasty, fresh and clean. Marinated pork tender and flavorful. Had the mango and sticky rice dessert, hate to say I have had better. Mango was perfect, but rather small portion. Sticky rice good, but made with a purple rice, different texture than the usual white. Overall very good meal. A bit pricey for smaller portions than used to. Owner came over to chat.

We had the the black pepper shrimp, egg rolls, beef short ribs, lemongrass chicken and sea food pho. The shrimp is so delicate and full of flavor. I wanted to kill the plate right there but I was sharing and had to be considerate of my mom and grandma and make sure they got some too. The egg rolls were delicious and my mom and grandma devoured them. The lemongrass chicken had this amazing crunchy texture and was full of so much fresh flavors. And the pho came in a huge bowl and we all shared it. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the beef short ribs. Not because it lacked flavor cause that was definitely not the case, but because there were too many bones and I had to work too hard to eat it. Now, one thing made our trip extra nice, our server and host is absolutely hilarious and she likes to stop and chat. We fell in love with her and all her sassafras from her personality to her bejeweled denim jacket.",

My close friend is Asian and a lover of fancy things, she had been bragging about this place for months. Cyclo completely lived up to its hype. The environment is modern with accent lighting and fresh flowers in water on every table. The water is diffused with exotic fruit. We ate spring rolls, green papaya salad, pho, a crepe dish called Bang XEO and mango sticky rice. We drank the home brewed passion fruit Kambucha. Exquisite. Everything was delicious, crisp, fresh, and hit the spot! You can tell that every detail is carefully planned and well executed. The integrity and careful preparation of the food is what sticks out the most. Thank you Justina such an extraordinary culinary experience! This was the best Vietnamese food I have ever had",

The owner Justine- she is Awesome but PLEASE be prepared for cussing and playful hazing, do not come if you don't have a sense of humor!!! But honestly she is very sweet woman, for example she hugs everyone on the way out.   Overall this place rocks and it's a foodie paradise!

    "text": "I've been a customer here for a few years now and love the food!  We usually get the pho noodle soup, banh xiao, and sometimes the spicy beef salad....all to die for!  I wanted to mention how sweet the owner is.  A friend of mine met me for lunch there with my very picky son. I was ordering a plain bowl of rice for him...and she intervened, lol...she told him she would make him something special that he would like.  He told her he liked chicken, so she went into the back and made or had someone make him a version of the lemongrass chicken cut into small bites without too much spice or seasoning...on top of rice.  My jaw dropped to the floor when he enthusiastically ate almost every bite.  She didn't want him to be hungry at her restaurant.  I just thought that was above and beyond....loyal customer for life!",

    "text": "The food at Cyclo is entirely over-shadowed by its outrageous owner, Justina Duong.  If Justina was a gay man, she would make a great drag queen.  I think she's a hoot, but her outlandish behavior and brash comments do not work for everyone.    I have a very dear friend who lives in Chandler and she and I would go into Cyclo quite often.  My friend is married with three kids, but just she and I would go in.  She would always tell Justina about her family and show her pictures of the kids.  Justina really gets into teasing the customers and after a couple of years, she told my friend, \"You crazy fag-hag.  You never bring your family in here.  You just come in with your gay friend.  You don't even have a family.  Crazy Lady, you just carry around those pictures to make your lonely self feel better.\"  Justina also plays up the Vietnamese accent.  She can be off-putting at first if you don't know what's up, but the floor show never disappoints if you're willing to play along.  The food is good enough now, but it was better when the restaurant first opened.  The star dishes include Tom Rang Hat Tieu, an appetizer of shrimp on toasted baguette slices with a savory black pepper sauce that is plate lickin' good.  Another delicious starter is Banh Xeo.  It's a crispy rice crepe with shrimp, pork, sprouts, and lettuce leaves for wrapping the crepe slices before you eat them.  For entrees, Ca Ri Ga is a tasty chicken and pineapple curry and Com Tam is a mixed grill of a marinated pork chop, beef, shrimp, and egg over broken rice.  As a side dish, the Dau Xanh Xao Toi is a sublime preparation of spicy garlic green beans with chili and sweet soy.    However, the quality now varies.  The last time I went the pineapple curry was totally bland.  Even though I have eaten at this place many times, I didn't say anything because I didn't want to be bothered with Justina's reaction.  Instead, I haven't been back.    I have been into Cyclo when Justina was not there and the quality of the food was nowhere near the same in her absence.  My concern is that Justina has announced plans (yet again) to open a second Cyclo in the Valley.  This time it's supposed to be on Central Avenue south of Camelback and across from Brophy with a fall 2008 opening.  Once that place opens, I assume Justina will move her floor show to central Phoenix and I am left to wonder if the quality of the food will continue to slip in Chandler.  Cyclo has a BYOB policy and some people are really into it.  For me, it's not a huge selling point.  I prefer not to schlep my own booze to a restaurant, but it's cool if you're into it.  If you go to Cyclo, hope that Justina is there.  You're really going to Cyclo for Justina's antics rather than the food.",

She is just plain obnoxious and fails in her attempt to be humorous and charming. She actually believes that she is a culinary standard bearer in the Valley.  The other is based on several breeches of hygienic standards. I have seen stuff that made me cringe. I love pho and Vietnamese food beaucoup, but I won't return on foot, taxi, car or pedal car.

Before Cyclo opened I used to go to the pho restaurant on Apache. I would get my customized fried rice-- chicken, shrimp, beef, eggs, and vegetables. They put a charred grilled pork right on top and I was in heaven.   Justine worked at the Apache restaurant. What a character. I love her attitude mixed with charm. She has a good humor and fresh outlook on life. I always looked forward to her crazy stories. More importantly she gave great advice on how to deal with boys. Cyclo became my comfort food therapy sessions. And that is why Cyclo gets five stars.",

Oh wait that's Justina! :) Cyclo does have a lot of personality to it with it's stylish decor and Justina just adds more to it. I really like the fact she comes and visits all the tables. Heck she's even sat down with us before. Love it when the owner likes to make nice with their patrons.  P.S - don't forget to bring your vino!  Onto the food...it's always fresh and flavorful. I've never had a bad experience here. The Pho is great, lemon grass chicken vermicelli is awesome and the green beans and pancake...Mmmmm!   This is the type of place I like bringing out of town guest to. You always know service is going to be good and there's no gambling with the food. I'm a fan Cyclo!",

However, the extreme hype surrounding this restaurant along with the numerous Valley awards it has received, probably led me to give it less than 5 stars since I didn't feel my dinner was worth endless raving.  The atmosphere is super cute and intimate, and service was very personable. If wanting to take a date to a Vietnamese spot, this would definitely be better than your rundown hole-in-the-wall, although much more pricier.  We started off with the spring rolls, egg rolls, and Thai Iced Tea. I hear their \"Made to Order Lemonade\" is also superb. My friend and I went with traditional Pho, while another got the Mi Xao Don (Pan Fried Egg Noodle) which was good, but would suggest the Pho because of its tasty broth.  My only negative remark is that it didn't have boba drinks or Vietnamese sandwiches like many smaller finds (Pho Avina in Glendale continues to be one of the best I've found in the Valley!), yet I would still recommend a visit.",

The flavors of the foods are amazing, really rich and sometimes a bit complex. Try the Hanoi and the shrimp appetizer...yum! And I truly enjoy the refreshing lemonade...a bit on the sweet side, but strangely refreshing! You have to go! Oh, and you can bring your own wine...just make sure it's a good bottle.

But I didn't love the menu prices.  Sorry, but here in OC I can't imagine paying $9 for pho!  It was good, but the soup wasn't hot enough for me.  The beef was pretty darn tasty though.  And the Vietnamese coffee was just right.  It was nice that they served it in. . .actually, I don't know what it's called.  The coffee drips into a cup of condensed milk.  Then you mix it and pour it into a glass of ice.  Now I wish I had ordered a dessert.",

Ambiance - It is a small place that is clean and open and comfortable. Even though it is on the small side it does not feel cramped. It is tastefully decorated and not kitschy like some Vietnamese restaurants can be.  Service - Our server was very sweet. She was available to answer questions, but didn't hover. She recommended the baby coconuts to drink with our meal since it is hella hot AZ summertime. We heard her helping the table next to us that had all kinds of special requests (ugh).  Food - SO YUMMY! I cannot go here and not order the spring rolls with shrimp so we split an order of those and they were as good as I remembered them being. The peanut sauce that comes with them is not too sweet and they were just right.  He ordered the lemon chicken because he can't not order their lemon chicken and it is so so so good. If you haven't had it yet then try it. We love it. I ordered Pad Thai - I know, Thai food at a Vietnamese place, but I couldn't help it, I was feeling noodle-y. It was definitely their own personal take on it, but I really loved it.  And those baby coconuts that the server recommended? HOLY COW. They were absolutely mind blowingly amazing. So delicious!

I had the green papaya salad which was pretty decent; not the best but not bad. My colleague ordered the pineapple curry and if I had to explain it, it seemed like they threw a packet of curry flavoring in with way too much rice and added way to much water - very bland. To make up for this we decided to order the lemongrass chicken and I can't say that really helped. It had better flavor but honestly tasted like it was made yesterday.   Did we order the wrong things? Maybe. But being from the Bay Area I've had some pretty awesome Vietnamese food and this just isn't up to standard. Sad day:(",

The fresh spring rolls could've been filled with more herbs, but I will say upon request we got another plate of herbs for our soup. It was one of the best I've found. (Especially good for Vegans.)  The owner was very friendly. She came around and visited with everybody. She let us know that her boyfriend made all the decor which was quite modern.

Since the weather has been chilly lately we decided to stop by and try some of their food.. we ordered egg rolls, mint chicken along with lemon grass chicken and small bowl beef pho which the waitress (owner?) said we were able to order bc she knew I was torn between pho and the chicken.. the pho was decent and both of chicken dishes were pretty good.. the only thing we are taking couple pts off is that it was little pricey then ur usual pho but other then that we will probably be back to try other things on their menu.. also the menu here is very limited to your other Vietnamese restaurants..",

The food is terrific (even the water is special, with fruit mixing with the ice in the pitcher), and the prices are low; you can have a feast for so little. I also like their BYOB policy, because we can bring a bottle of wine with no corkage fee, so we end up having paid (for a bottle of wine) about the same as a glass of wine would cost at other restaurants. Some of our favorite dishes (for 2 people):  we start by sharing an order of spicy green beans and fresh summer spring rolls, then each of us order one of the great main dishes, and then we end by sharing a mango rice dessert.  News flash: the outgoing former owner recently sold Cyclo. We know the new owners (they are so nice) from their shop in Tempe, Lee's Tailoring. They have astutely kept the same great kitchen staff, menu, and recipes. They even had the amazing home-made kombucha on hand (we had the blood orange flavor). This place rocks!",

Nobody should have to bay over $5.75 for ANY type of pho.    I've gone there 2x and I don't know if it's just me, but the hostess there just rubbed me the wrong way both times.  She was cracking jokes and making comments that were borderline inappropriate.    They focus more on decor and trying to \"entertain\" their patrons rather than focusing on what's really important... the food.  You want a really good, AUTHENTIC bowl of Pho?  Go to Saigon Pho on Alma School/Knox.  It's not as ritzy and refined, but the pho and other menu items there are less expensive, tastes better, and they serve you much larger portions.    Eat at Cyclo if you want to have a SEEMINGLY over-attentive hostess bothering you while you try to eat.  (I say \"seemingly\" because while you may think she's over-attentive, in reality, she hasn't even done as much as refill your water glass.)",

I can't seem to be able to check in here  Pros: Ambiance, Small Establishment (mom and popish... something I support)  Cons: Probably everything else.  This is my 5th time visiting this place and the only reason for it has been its proximity. The service has always been shoddy (subjective). I guess you have to be a regular or catch the owners eye to be given any sort of good service. As for me I got the \"don't care for you\" service ( even though only 4 tables were occupied during the lunch hour). I guess I must be becoming invisible.  Food: Saw the prices and was a bit surprised (asian upper class restaurant?? somewhat of an anomaly, easily double of what you get in other Vietnamese restaurants. Thought to myself the food better rock for these prices). Ordered the mint chicken, what I got was a well decorated but bland and not seasoned dish. I had to put in heaps of fish sauce and oyster sauce just to make it palatable.   What a waste of good earned cash and a bad aftertaste to boot. Hopefully in future this review will remind me never to visit this place again.",

We visited Cyclo for the first time on the first Friday after a very positive review by the Arizona Republic food critic Howard Seftel.  The small place was slammed.  Being a woman of action, I stepped in and helped by being the \"hostess\" and taking down names for a waiting list.  Guess that helped me become friends with the acerbic but deep down sweet woman that is Justina Duong.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Spring rolls are compact but full of all sorts of meat and veggies.  Bun Hanoi and Bun Saigon are tasty treats full of fresh herbs and vegetables.  My husband loves this lemon chicken curry dish that to me smells like Lemon Pledge, but he gets it each time.   the beef pho is full of flavor and comes with a mound of salad, unlike some of the other \"cheaper\" pho shops nearby.    i can't imagine anyone has complaints with the food at Cyclo.  If they do, it is probably that their judgment is clouded as they came on a Friday and Saturday night at 7 p.m. to a 14 table establishment and expected to be served immediately and be fawned after.  If you are this needy, don't come here and take up a table...we're waiting patiently to be served. :)",

I would've gone to Saigon Pho if I wanted cheaper, or to Unphogettable or Chandler Pho if I wanna pay extra but have decently flavored food. The atmosphere is modern. Clean. The second time I had To Go and this lady server (I'm assuming owner, hear me out why), was extremely loud and annoying, touching customers in unnecessary ways like patting the back while eating. She was dancing and really was all over the place (I'm thinking a bit drunk). Anyway, no, I will not come back anymore. I have no idea why people visit this place. It's either they don't know a much better Viet cuisine or they have no choice.",

Since we came from the bay area, this place had a big shoes to fill.  Pretty small place, the simple decorations are nice (or it was about 2 years ago). Selection of food isn't as big as some other Vietnamese places around here, but definitely higher-priced pho than most places. It's $9-$12 for a bowl of pho, a bit pricey much? I guess I'm more used to $7-8 for a bowl.   This was the first time I've ever been to a pho place and seen the owner dressed up like she's ready to walk down New York Fashion Week. I mean, she's nice and everything, but a little flashy for me. Not sure if I'd like my food to be prepared by someone wearing a mini skirt? I mean, assuming she's helping out in the kitchen and everything. But she does run the food back and forth. Almost makes me think that the high prices of the food are to support her fashion/makeup fetish. Eh.  I really can't complain about the food, but I do have a gripe with the pricing. Authentic Vietnamese food should be priced accordingly.",

    "text": "The 3 rating is purely based on the food itself, which was okay. I don't think there was much of service available. We went on a slow night, so can't say the restaurant was brimming with people. They kept the door open, and that let insects inside. I even saw some flying insects disturbing us while eating. The lady at the counter was doing everything, taking order, taking payments, serving which was causing unnecessary delays. Coming to the food, lemongrass chicken was served dry to be eaten with rice without any fish sauce, haven't seen this in any other Vietnamese restaurant. The other guy who was serving did not understand English well, as when we asked for fish sauce from this guy, nothing came out. After dinner, we were made to wait for 10+ minutes for desert, and was asked if were in any hurry when we checked with the lady about when we are going to get the dessert. The communication of the restaurant staff with customers leaves a lot to be expected, so is the service. I think there are better Vietnamese and Asian fusion places in town.",

I have become a \"Pho Aficionado\" and I love the strong flavors in the best Phos. Cyclo's Pho leaves a lot to be desired! Broth is generally too thin, although the service is beautifully done. Plus their Pho is expensive when compared to other \"Pho Joints\" that I believe have better Pho.  Everything else I have eaten on their menu (and I have eaten most everything!) is indeed PHABULOUS, so I will just go elsewhere for my Pho Phix! Besides, I would miss NOT seeing Justina (Cyclo Owner) who is a delightful experience, not to mention the delightful experiences available on their menu, other than the Pho!!",

This excess amount of fat was gross (and I'm not even usually picky about fat).  We've had a lot of pho, but never something this bad.  I really wanted to like this place.  The decor is cute...all Ikea furniture and cool art on the walls.  They played pop music.  Service was friendly and the place appears to be family owned.  Our egg rolls were good, but we only got 3 and most places usually serve 6.   The price was ridiculous!  We ordered our usual...2 bowls of pho thai (1 large & 1 small), 2 drinks, and an order of egg rolls.  Most places we've ever ate at charge between $20-$25.  For this nasty meal...we paid $34!

Lots of chicken on the Cyclo menu, which based upon my experience at other Vietnamese places apparently isn't very typical Vietnamese...and dang it I'm allergic to chicken so I notice and dislike heavily chicken-biased menus.  Of all the meat and rice dishes only one is not chicken.  We ordered the spring rolls with pork and shrimp - very nice, though I would have preferred fish sauce over peanut sauce.  Next was beef pho.  Also decent but nothing to make me drive all the way to Chandler (I was passing through today).  it was a good meal, and it looks like there are some other interesting items on the very small-ish menu, but I really don't understand all the fuss about this place.  What did Seftel see in it that I don't ?  Of course Seftel thinks Yelp is one of the worst ideas of the last decade so my faith in him is slowly being shaken....  Cyclo doesn't shake a stick at Da Vang or the long lost Pho Loc....",

    "text": "Damn all of you who rave about this place.  I live like 2 mintues from Cyclo and have been wanting to try it for a couple years now.  So my son and I went last night for a little date :o)  We came in and had to use the resetroom first... then were told that we could sit anywhere... so we did, well then we just sat there for like 5 minutes with no menu, no drink order, NOTHING... our waiter was sitting at the table next to us EATING... that's fucking awesome, you take your time, we're not here to dine or anything!  Finally he gives us a menu... takes another snack break with his gramma or whoever?  and some lady with a sour face, maybe his aunt?  finally takes our drink order.  I had the Thai Iced Tea, which wasn't that great... first of all it was ORANGE... never had it this color before and I've had a fair share (cept the one at Saigon Pho was orange too, vietnamese thing???).  I could've ignored the color if the taste was better... we didnt get straws, but then our waiter disappeared for a while and brought back straws from walgreens... without a wrapper on it... DO I REALLY WANT TO USE THE STRAW YOU JUST HAD YOUR DIRTY ASS HANDS ON??  So by this time, I'm thinking we should have just gone to Chino Bandido on the other side of the parking lot.  He finally comes back to take our order, we had the Chicken Wings for an appetizer and decided to share the Pad Thai.  Our wings arrived fairly quickly... they were actually tasty and pretty spicy.  The only thing I didn't really enjoy were the ton of seeds... just not a great mouth feel.  Now something happened that really bugs the crap outta me.  We JUST GOT our wings and had barely taken a couple bites when our entree arrived.  Dont they know about timing?  I dont want my entree yet, I know it might sound picky, but I would really like to enjoy my appetizer and not feel rushed because I dont want my entree to get cold.  Sorry... I know I'm ranting...  So we finished a wing and decided to start on the Pad Thai, which, even though we tried to hurry to it, was kinda cold now, and the noodles were all congealed together in a big lump-o-noodle. The flavor was good, I liked the shrimp in it too, but Dom and I agreed that the chunks of egg were \"weird\".  I prefer little shreds of egg and I also prefer it to be served on a plate rather than a bowl so that the \"gravy\" keeps the noodles mosty separated instead of in a noodle ball.  Oh, and this version was made with very thin noodles, I prefer the wide noodle for this dish.  Maybe I'm being picky, but that's my right as a patron I guess.  So we kinda picked some more at our food and then Dom had to use the restroom... so he did his thing, and I waited for the bill which took another little while to come even though there were only two other tables occupied.   Overall, I thought the food was ok, nothing spectacular at all though.  I guess I really had high expectations for Cyclo  - and that mixed with the poor service (just lacked any personality , friendliness, or attentiveness), I just felt let down.  I'll give it another chance in the hopes that the service is better, and perhaps the owner will be there to liven things up?",

The pho broth was delicious, the meat was very thinly sliced, too! The service was fast and the owner worked the room beautifully! People were at the tables leaning over and being friendly, telling us how much they love the place. The decor is so fun and artistic! Cute little cyclo riding skellies sit atop a mango red-orange wall and oil paintings adorn another. The owner was adorable with my boyfriend's three year old son - he was most welcome at Cyclo.

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for a while now because of all the Yelp reviews but when we went there for dinner last night I wasn't that impressed. Maybe because my expectations were too high. We started with the pork spare ribs which had a really yummy sauce on them. But the sauce was a little too thin and didn't really adhere to the meat and the ribs themselves were chopped up into bite sized pieces which made them somewhat difficult to eat. I ordered beef pho for my entree and of course it was delicious (Is it possible to have bad pho?) but I found that the broth had less flavor to it than other places I've tried. Like some spices were missing or something. My hubby ordered the mixed grill with rice and he was pretty happy since it came with a lot of meat. We also split the flan for dessert and it wasn't anything special. The fun and funky decor was cool but I found the plastic chairs to be pretty uncomfortable.  I thought that the prices were pretty reasonable. We spent $35 for a fairly large amount of food. I am surprised by some of the other reviews that said Cyclo is too expensive. Who says authentic Asian food has to be dirt cheap? The owner has created a cute little trendy restaurant with a loyal following (we saw lots of regulars greeted warmly) and so she can charge a little more than your average strip mall dive.  In summary, I enjoyed my experience here but was not overly impressed with the food. I might come back if I was in the neighborhood but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.",

All the food was fresh, and very authentic, according to our friend who has been to Vietnam. The spicy green beans were amazing, I could eat them like french fries. I had the pad thai with tofu for my entree and it was SO GOOD! The noodles tasted freshly made, the tofu was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and the sauce was not overly peanutty or overpowering. My hubby had a giant bowl of pho soup, which he thoroughly enjoyed. I liked that they had so many vegetarian options.   As for the ambiance, I really enjoyed it. The lighting, decor and music was happy and modern. We met the owner, Justine, and I was actually scared to meet her based on the previous reviews I had read on Yelp. Well, turns out the reviews couldn't have been more wrong. She is sweet and personable and she lightheartedly joked with our table. She gracefully floated throughout the tables the whole night, making people laugh and making sure they were taken care of. In my opinion, more owners should be this way, because it shows that they really care about their customers and their experience. BOTTOMLINE: I will definitely come back!",

It was plentiful and extremley good.   This did not help the location and decor. When you go somewhere that is trying too hard to be trendy there are some expectations. The plastic seats made it feel like I was at a Burger King. That made me feel like I was over paying even though the food was real good. I would go back for the food but the sad truth is as good as the food is, I would want a better environment.",

If you are in the area or from the other side of town (like myself) I would highly suggest getting your butt here. the menu is also very simple, which I like. There isn't 453 items on the menu. Where else can you go where the owner of the place is constantly there insuring quality and service. Overall Cyclo is PHOnominal!!!!",

I had never had Vietnamese food before, so couldn't tell what to order. Her recommendations were the Vietnamese egg roll, Spring roll, and the Black Pepper Shrimp with garlic toast. The first two were good. Although, my pallet did need to get used to the Spring roll, because I did not expect it to be a cool dish, I thought it was delicious.  My favorite? The black pepper shrimp. It had the perfect spicing between the garlic on the bread and a little bit of cilantro, I definitely wanted more.  Highly Recommended!!!",

Their veggie spring rolls are amazing, and the peanut sauce that comes with them is phenomenal. On our second trip, we got a double order. :) The Pho Hai San is some of the best pho I've ever had, with whole, peeled shrimp, scallops, and crab legs IN THE SHELL so you know you're getting the real deal and not imitation crab. My husband has gotten the Pho Ga and Pho Tai and raved about both. Even the complimentary water, with huge slices of fresh fruit in it, is great. We can't wait to go again.",

    "text": "We should have been tipped off by the overall Caucasian-invasion that made up the patrons.  When you are in a new city, you want to know where the \"locals\" go.  Same applies to cuisine.  If I've offended my fellow Caucasoids, I do apologize.  Many of you do know good food regardless of ethnicity.  The folks dining at Cyclo on the regular, clearly do not.  While the decor was funky and trendy, it felt more like a hair salon than a restaurant and the clear plastic chairs were not particularly comfortable.    We ordered two appetizers:  egg rolls and pork short ribs.  The egg rolls were good, I will say, but the pork was incredibly fatty and hard to eat off the bone.  Our entrees were two types of Rice Vermicelli:  Hanoi and Saigon.  Wholly underwhelming and WAY overpriced.  We didn't even bother with the pho at $9-$12 per bowl!  They likely mark up the soup to pay for the real hydrangeas on the tables.  Nice touch, but I'd rather have good, inexpensive soup which I can get literally anywhere in those parts.  Lastly, what is the deal with the infused water?  Lemon or lime I can tolerate--Phoenix Metro isn't known for it's delicious drinking water.  But cucumber and strawberry and something else I could not place is forcing flavors on everyone who just wants hydration.  It's water.  Try not to over think it.",

It exudes the exuberance of youth, but doesn't quite capture the authenticity and depth of menu that Khai Hoan does.  The interior is similar to a funky little boba shop, with lots of bright, pop-star colors and design, and those that are unfamiliar with Vietnamese cuisine may find this as a good stepping stone.  The menu is very limited, and portions are smaller than Khai Hoan, albeit more fancifully decorated with flair.  Prices are also higher.  The papaya salad I had was good, and had a good balance of tangy, spicy, and sweet.  My husband's mixed grill entree was decent, but the strips of meat were slightly overcooked so they tasted tough.  Justine, the owner, was here and she is charming, vibrant, and always has a funny story to tell.  I do give her props for creating a more welcoming atmosphere for those that are usually afraid to try different foods, but for me, I'll probably head to Khai Hoan for my Vietnamese fix.",

This is what more restaurants should strive for. Fresh, lively, and with a high attention to detail. Having an owner running the front of house with that kind of enthusiasm for their restaurant is refreshing. I saw some other reviewers post that she may have used some salty language...f*ck yeah she did and I loved it. She read the table and was very playful and charming.

This is not it, they're way over price and the quality of food does not make up for the poor service or the portion size.  You're looking at a $13 entree avg price, which is already high - but they don't make up for it in flavor/taste.  It took a while to get our food when two other parties got theirs before ours.  One of the pork chops on our table was really dry. Described it as eating jerky!  When looking around for the hostess to get our bill, she was sitting down eating with a friend.  Like others I've heard great things by word of mouth... But I won't be coming back here at all.  The good: It has a \"wanna be trendy\" little vibe to the restaurant decor. There was a diverse crowd when I was there. It's a small establishment, but clean.  I'll keep it 100... When someone chooses to not talk to you in the native language of the cuisine they're serving... That's when you need to get up out of your chair and leave. That should have been the warning sign for me.  Bottom line: Never hurts to try a new spot. But don't let me say...\"I told you so\"",

Cyclo was highly recommended by several colleagues and I had to try it for myself to see what the buzz is about.   First off, for all you who come from somewhere else...Like \"The Bay\" or \"New York\" or wherever you come from...? Just as a reminder you currently live in Arizona! I'm from Louisiana where there are also a lot of great Vietnamese restaurants, but who cares...I live here.   My most cherished dish here is the X.L. Beef Noodle Pho Soup. It includes braised brisket, rare sirloin, rice noodles and all the fixings so be prepared with a huge bowl if you get this to-go. If you think 12 bucks is too much for this bowl, go to some fast food franchise. The location is relatively small and intimate with ambient lighting in the evening. Additionally this is a BYOB establishment so feel free to bring your own wine or spirits...Try that at other Vietnamese restaurants!  Justine is mind-blowing and awesome in her own way! She's the owner and also works at the establishment. She's straight forward and not afraid to speak her mind so she's not for the weak hearted. When dining in, she makes her way to every table to ensure your dish suits your desire.   I hope this was informative and most importantly...Enjoy your meal.",
