We dined in a beautiful quaint restaurant with excellent service and the food was wonderfully delicious. He had the ribeye medium rare with a choice of two sides for only $20. She/I had the filet mignon with shrimp and choice of two sides for $26.         Both dishes were cooked as ordered and I especially loved my filet. It was extremely tender and flavorful, the asparagus spears where lightly grilled and crisp the way I like it and the garlic mashed potatoes, YUM!  Unfortunately, the potatoes au gratin was raw and not cooked. But, they brought out the mashed potatoes to substitute and apologized.  We were also served fresh baked bread in a variety of flavors: white, wheat-oat and a spiraled pepperoni bread, bacon cornbread and with a side of their Amaze-Balls pesto! I loved it so much they gave me a hand printed recipe! Say what?!?! Who does that? Sweeeeet!  We also received a complimentary raspberry sorbet prior to our entrees and raspberry chocolate truffles at the end of our meal.  Not only is the food at an incredible deal, it's flavorful, great portion sizes including the meat cuts. Super delish and you get waaaay more than what you pay for!       I cannot believe this is our first time here. We have normally dined at Willows inside the casino after a show, but now this is another favorite in this small casino.  I found it very interesting that the manager of Cholla informed her husband is also the manager at Willows. I'm like score! They are obviously doing something right with both places and married. So cool!  Excellent staff all around from the wait staff to the management. We will definitely return. You can't beat this incredible deal! Extreme value! I'm bringing my family here when they visit!!  Thank you Cholla for a wonderful dining experience! :)",

    "text": "My wife and I have been going to Cholla for 20 years. It has always been good but recently some quality and cost saving issues have cropped up. On a recent visit I ordered the seafood bisque and I have enjoyed it for years. This last time it was the consistency of ketchup and the bowl was filled right to the brim. It was unappetizing and no longer a soup. We both ordered filets and what arrived were two end cuts. The meat was good quality but an end cut cannot be cooked the same throughout. This was obviously done to save money. This is the second time this has happened. It is inexcusable in a good steak house. If you have to raise prices to serve a correct  steak then do it. Cholla used to be famous for its baby carrots. What I received were normal carrots trimmed to look like baby carrots. The sauces served with our steaks were cold. All of this is fixable but I am afraid the cost cutting and inattention to detail is sad. The Cholla of old is now just a fond memory.  We went back several days later to try things again. After so many years of going here we were not going to give up that easy. Everything was perfect. The bisque was great, the steaks perfect and my favorite carrots were just the right size. Glad things are back together,",

    "text": "After an amazing drive threw the wilderness starting in Chandler up to Payson then Christopher Creek and a back road to Young and down to Globe we decided we wanted steak. Had nothing to do with all the cows we saw along the way.  Once again I'm Yelping for beef!  This place had mostly the best reviews. So we gave it a try. Now don't get confused with Morton's you are entering a casino. I read it was \"dressy\" recommended and someone's comment that it was far from that and given we've been driving for hours with the windows down we were absolutely not dressy. I figure \"casino\".... We can go however we please. And I was right. We got there at. 4:40 and they don't open until 5:00 so we put out name in the reservation book and walked around for 20 minutes.   They were very friendly and the bus-man was super friendly.  Linda was our waitress too and she was very welcoming.   We both had New York strip, baked potato and asparagus. In addition we ordered creamed spinach. My only complaint was medium rare came medium. My husband did not like the basaltic onions on his steak. He thought they were over powering. I liked them.   We had calamari. I was not thrilled with it but husband liked them. They tasted like they had cinnamon in the breading.   The price was great and for that four stars.   PS. Concord Road down Hwy 288. With a stop at McFadden lookout a must!",

Arrived and were seated promptly, our table was ready and waiting for us. Make a reservation! It's a small place, and you don't want to miss this opportunity!  We ordered and the yummy parade began! Got our drinks, which were constantly refilled. Next received a warm hand towel to wash our hands, then a small taste of the filet-to whet our appetites. The bread was warm and delicious, and the pesto sauce was yummy! The little cornbread skillet was also tasty.  Enjoyed my salad next-the steak one. This could have been my meal! So good, and big too! My husband got the crab stuffed prawns which he wouldn't share ;)-so that tells you how good that was!  Then we got a delicious lemon sorbet to cleanse our palettes.  By the time my ribeye arrived (which was enormous, btw!) I was nearly full!! It was tasty smothered in a yummy mushroom sauce, but I couldn't finish it. The baked potato and brocolli were also good. Husband's new your strip was also fabulous-and a more reasonable 12oz size. My friends filet was about 6oz and would have been plenty for me. Everyone raved about their steaks and sides.  They finished off my meal with a complimentary crime brulee with candle. Very yummy and kind of them! The check came with a raspberry truffle that received mixed reviews from our group. The bill was very reasonable for the quality, flavor, service and experience we all enjoyed.   Thank you! Can't wait to come back again soon!",

Such reasonable prices, and the tasting spoon, bread basket and pallete cleanser that comes before your entree is phenomenal. The intro alone to your meal is worth 4 stars.  Bread:There is a variety of breads, including one with bacon swirled into the bread, and amazing mini jalapeno-cornbread skillets. It is to die for. The bread also comes with a pesto dipping sauce.   The tasting spoon (don't know what to call it lol): Every night, the chef prepares a one-bite tasting spoon--my favorite was a bite of filet mignon with bleu cheese crumble over some arugula.   Pallete Cleanser: Lemon Sherbert! So refreshing and delightful!  And then the entrees. I have had Lamb and Filet, and they have always been perfectly cooked. Their mushroom sauce is amazing. Everything my husband and his family gets always looks amazing as well--I don't think they can do anything wrong!  We also always get the Sweet Corn Casserole! It's one of the prime sides for $5 and it's large enough that I always have leftovers for another meal the next day. It is so delicious -- crunch, sweet, creamy -- and tastes just as good the next day.  The entrees range between $20-$30 for their steaks, which is on par or cheaper than other steak houses. But what you get for the money is way more worth it. The same entree at Monti's is $40+, and I don't enjoy it nearly as much!   All in all, I cannot tell you how much I love this place. I love it so much I'm always waiting for the next holiday so I can suggest Cholla's as a place to eat :P",

You get welcomed right when you step in,  seated and order taken promptly, and the entire staff make sure they check in on you to ensure you're comfortable.  I ordered a seafood bisque,  ribeye steak medium rare,  lobster mashed potatoes,  and creamed corn casserole.    Prior to getting your meal,  they give you a hot hand towel and a complementary variety bread basket.  The bacon cornbread is individually made and paired with their jalapeno pesto dipping sauce was OMG. I dislike cornbread, so if I loved it then it is pretty damn good!  The seafood bisque was full of shrimp, scallops, and real pieces of crab which was surprising for the price. The steak was cooked as ordered and it was so tender and soft! The lobster mashed potato had real lobster pieces liberally placed within. The creamed corn casserole had a corn bread crust and bell peppers to give the corn an extra pop of taste.   The one thing I was sad about was being so stuffed that I ended up packing most of my meal to go! This is Ruth Chris type of fine dining at Outback Steakhouse prices. If I visit the Phoenix area again,  I will definitely make sure I go back here!",

I ordered a rare steak, and it came out medium, to medium-rare.  My husband ordered medium-rare steak and his steak was closer to rare, so we switched steaks.   The restaurant gave us a free desert for the screw up, and that was nice of them.  The desert was good, the fresh berries were excellent, and the wine was excellent.",

At $22 for a Filet Mignon, I can easily say, it's the best 5-star Filet Mignon under 25 bucks. Came with two delicious sides- I got broccoli and mashed potatoes. Best broccoli I have ever had. Got the crab filled shrimp appetizer and it did not disappoint.  We had Sangria and it was priced well and was delicious. They also brought out bread during the wait.  Very good experience.

After you are done with Dinner, you can always hang around for a little gambling to finish up the evening with some excitement. Strongly recommend this place!",

Rather short food selection but quite balanced and truly professionally prepared dishes, meat cooked right, veggies as well! A small \"amuse-bouche\" greets you shortly after you take possession of your table, a clever mini hand towel warmer, a gadget for sure, tells you you should wash your hands prior to dining....haha! The shrimp bisque, the mushroom/steak soup both were excellent and generously served, the Chateaubriand, as always, was top! My wife's cocktail was well prepared and the selection of wines by the glass was quite acceptable, although as a French man, I would have liked to see at least 2 wines from France, a white and a red. And since nothing is ever \"perfect\", I would say that the sorbet served graciously mid meal, could be, should be, less sweet, maybe a tad tart with a touch of citrus or booze....this one was good but more of a dessert style. We were greeted with a smile, served efficiently with a smile by both the waitress and her assistant and the charming waitress was well versed about the restaurant, the menu and the wines....what else could anyone want?...oh yes, a reasonable check! that came our way as well! Great job Chef and the whole crew....why not 5 stars? simply because no one is perfect, out of \"principle\" I guess.",

I love it so much that, for occasions special enough to warrant it, I will drive to the other side of the city, go to a casino I otherwise would never visit, and walk through a room that is more cigarette smoke than oxygen just to get in this restaurant's front door. Once I am inside? Perfection. The food is fantastic, always, and very affordable considering the quality and quantity. But my favorite part is how they treat their guests. Out of all the restaurants I visit, this is the one that always makes me feel special. Samples from the kitchen. Sorbet palate cleaners. Damp cloth towels to clean your hands. Macaroons with the check. I always leave feeling like I got a glimpse of how people richer than me live, and I can just be myself in my normal clothes to get it.   Also, the prime steak is fantastic, and if I recall correctly, they bring you creme brulee if it's your birthday or similar special occasion. Delicious creme brulee. Yum.",

    "text": "While this is not quite experience that the name might suggest (\"Prime Steakhouse\" brings to mind Mastro's, Durant's, etc.), it is a great value and a solid place to grab a good steak.  Ambience is semi-upscale, bright (for a steakhouse), and relaxed - fits nicely in the locals casino and is a good escape from the noise, smoke, lights, etc.  Service is solid and friendly.  Drinks are reasonably priced and done like any nicer casino bar.  I had a competently made Old Fashioned (something surprisingly difficult to come by), and my wife, a sapphire & tonic - both generously poured.  They started us with an amuse bouche of filet w/ Bearnaise and micro-greens.  Cute, simple, and tasty.  We both started with the cranberry spinach salad.  They were presented nicely, but like their bread varieties, it was a heavy-handed.  The flavor was quite nice, but the salad was badly over-dressed.  Both of us also ordered filets for the main course.  I had mine with \"prawns\" (clearly your average shrimp).  Temperatures were both missed on the high-side.  I asked for med-rare and got med plus.  My wife ordered med and there was little if any pink to be found in her steak.  However, the filets were tender and seasoned perfectly.   Bearnaise and mushroom sauces were done really nicely.   Sides were solid.  Broccolini, braised carrots, garlic mashed, and au gratin.  Altogether, we got out the door (tax and 22% tip) for just about a hundred bucks - a great price for this kinda meal.  There are little high-end hints throughout (ex. palate cleanser between courses, amuse bouche, finger towels, etc.), but the overall experience is more akin to Black Angus (both in terms of price and execution) and the like - but with a definitely a notch up on the steaks.  It's a great deal and worth a visit if you want a better-than-chain steak, but don't wanna shell out for Mastro's or Capital Grille.",

We were thrilled with not only the fantastic food, but the service was first class. Our only regret is that after living in the valley for over 40 years and experiencing inconsistencies with the local 5 Star establishments...that we never came here!! The food was delicious (we had filet mignon, rib eyes and salmon) and the service was wonderful. Yes, as per some of the prior reviews, walking through the smoke filled casino is a bit of a negative, but we felt it was well worth the two minute breath holding. They also (without request) presented our son with a lovely congratulations slice of cake (I mentioned it was his graduation dinner when I made the reservation because I was a little concerned with timing and possibly being late). This will be our new place to come on a frequent basis!!  Am updating my review and changing to 3 stars. The service was wonderful as always (ILSE is great) and my husband's lamb chops and son's filet were very good;however, my rib eye was awful. I've had it there before and it was great, but tonight, it was truly inedible (gummy, thinly sliced and no taste except for the sauce). I literally had two bites. My son & husband tasted it and were shocked at just how bad it was (perhaps a bad cut of meat)?  I told Ilse, but no one came to ask us about it. I will say though that I finally tried the lobster mashed potatoes and they were FANTASTIC!! This was our anniversary and eating potatoes and asparagus is not something I had planned for dinner. Not certain we will go back. I had originally downgraded to 4 stars, but my husband thought that to be too generous given that my evening was not what it should have been.  AND NO COMMENT FROM MGMT.... THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES. WOULD HAVE MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE...will never recommend again.",

Enjoyed a nice evening meal with friends last night.  Started with cocktails (2 @8.34) Blackened Sirloin with two sides and a Caesar Salad for 29.00.  Sirloin was medium rare after asking for \"rare\".  A bit too spicy for me and I like spicy.  Sides were fine: Baked Potato and asparagus.  My mate ordered the salmon, a Caesar Salad and had no complaints. Hers 25.00. Total bill was 78.45 including a cup of coffee for me after dinner.  (tip15.00) Total 93.45  Prices on menu seemed reasonable.  The Casino was half full on a Sunday night at 5:30-6 and the restaurant had a total of 5 tables while we were there.  Not planning on returning, but not bad if you are already there gambling and want a decent dinner.  I'd just like to add that anyplace that has \"Steakhouse\" in their title should really specialize in above average cuts of beef.  I couldn't attest to that. Our other couple with us had the Chateaubriand for Two.  Looked fine.  They had been there before.",

The restaurant looked full, but that's only because it lacks a bigger sized dining room. Decor is a 3.5/5, it comes of as a classy upscale place to dine, but the tangible cloths and tables are nothing to be impressed about.   My gf had the Ceasar Salad as starters. $6 (we split) It was absolutely delicious. Then served us 3 types of breads (original, cherry infused, & pepperoni -which tastes much like pizza sticks) & they were absolutely awesome. While we ate, a server came along and gave us tiny little samples of cheese, steakbites, cornbread, sorbet, and other delicious munchies.  For our entrees we has 2 Filet Mignon plates, crab infused mash & sauteed asparagus.   Each entree was only $22! The meat was tender and full of flavor!   We didn't have any drinks this time around, but if they're as good as their food... They will be cheap and amazing!   They topped it off with an 'on the house' old fashioned chocolate cake. It was AMAZING, and definitely put the cherry on top for the dinner.   The staff was amazing throughout the entire process and created a great atmosphere.   Look- I know it's located at an old casino, and you might be reluctant to approach it for that manner... BUT, I promise to won't be disappointed. Your wallet & tummy will thank you!",

They brought out sample nuggets of filet mignon, specialty breads and little nuggets of lemon sorbet to start, then after the fabulous dinner brought scrumptious little nuggets of raspberry chocolate dessert, all complementary touches that were very classy. One of the best features was how quiet the restaurant was, we were able to hear each other, a lot of steakhouses are crowded and noisy making the experience more about the food and not the conversation. This was a wonderful experience !!",

    "text": "We went to this restaurant the other night, for my wife's birthday. We both really enjoyed our meal, from start to finish. It's a very small place, inside the Casino Arizona. Once inside the restaurant, you would have no clue there is a casino outside their door. No smoke smell or casino noise.     A very nice bread basket was delivered to our table. It has soft patties of butter as well as  pesto flavored olive oil. Great presentation!    They brought over two small pieces of tenderloin with a side of horse radish sause, for us to try. That was exceptional & we didn't even ask for it. How nice is that?    They bring you a little scoop of lemons sorbet, to cleanse your pallet, before your meal. That was an unexpected pleasure and again, no charge. Very nice touch!    I had the Steak & Mushroom soup. It had diced angus beef and Portobello & crimini mushrooms, in a cabernet brown broth. It was excellent and it was a meal in it self. The price was only $7. My wife had the Caesar salad and she said it was excellent. Both portions were very generous in size.    Next came our main course. We split a Chateaubriand for two. The char-grilled tenderloin came sliced with a side of Aujus & Bearnaise. It was cooked perfectly and it tasted great. Price was $39.     Our sides were Lobster mashed potatoes and au-gratin potatoes. Both were excellent. Price was included with our main course.     Service was not at all rushed. Our young waitress wasn't very talkative and she did start to clear my plate while my wife was still eating. A little more training and she will be just fine.     Dinner was so filling, we didn't have room for dessert. They did sound great, maybe next time.    Our bill was extremely fair & reasonable. I already recommended this restaurant to two couples we know. Don't let the casino atmosphere deter you from this nice affordable restaurant. It's small, might seat 50 or 60 people, so call ahead and make a reservation, like we did.     My return factor is 85%",

    "text": "First let me say I want to LOVE this Place. I LOVE that I can wear shorts and a t-shirt to have a nice steak dinner. I will start at the beginning. The reservation at 5pm on October 4th, 2014 was made and it was notated that it was a Birthday celebration. Cool. We show up at 5pm and are seated straight away, they just opened. Our Server Is Linda, if you have read other reviews she gets great raves. I ask for a Martini menu? No such thing so she went and asked and it seemed they really didn't have any infused vodka martinis so Vodka martini up it was. Husband had a draft Blue moon. We had looked at the menu ahead of time so we knew what we wanted and ordered. This place, as you have read, has a bunch of really nice little touches. The taste for today was a salmon sashimi. Not my cup of tea. The bread basket everyone raves about included Jalepeno bread, Cranberry bread and a dark Rosemary bread, all COLD and tasteless. It comes with pesto and butter, Pesto and Cranberry bread? OK, no big deal. Linda is extremely attentive but the star of this show is THE BUSMAN, who is about 50% waiter. He is superb and on point,. So husband orders the Elk Tenderloin and a Wedge salad. I ask Linda for her suggestion between the shrimp cocktail and the stuffed shrimp and she say go with the cocktail. I wish I hadn't, the cocktail sauce was so heavy with horseradish I couldn't use it so there's that. I followed with the Seafood Soup OMG! it was huge and PURE heaven! I wish I had just stopped there but hey it was my Birthday! I ordered the Filet and again asked Linda for her advise on temp because servers know how their chef's cook. Medium isn't medium everywhere. I told her just PINK throughout and she said medium. Cool. It came with my choice and I picked Au Gratin Potatoes. The small restaurant is filling up fast now and Linda where did you go? We never saw her again, well we did, she was in the room, just not at our booth. I have worked in the food industry and I think her  \"station\" (the tables they work) got changed and we were no longer in her station. Someone else brought out entrees, Husband loved his, mine, well it was RAREY RARE RARE. Should I have sent it back? Well, no one was there to send it to and Husband asked me not to so we could eat together. I ate my au gratin Potatoes and they were good! I took all but 2 bites of the Filet home with lots of potatoes. Again Thanks BUSMAN for packaging that up! Husband wanted dessert and coffee but no on came.....ever. A very loud drunk 4top was seated behind us and I was done. Husband considered it free entertainment. No Birthday dessert,  no coffee. He finally took out his AMEX and put it where it could be seen although we had No check.  The manager sees it and processes it and it's $100 and where are the little tiny sweets that are presented with the check...NOWHERE. Not a Happy Birthday Dinner for me, but this place has a lot going for it, I would suggest if you are celebrating a life moment, come on a weekday evening because Saturday night , even at 5pm didn't cut it. We left 15% because Damn That BUSMAN earned it.",

It came with bernaise sauce but next time I will probably leave it off as the filet can stand on its own with no frills.  I thought the potatoes were a little too cheesy and rich, I only had a couple of bites.  Asparagus was perfectly cooked but the carrots could have used a little more cooking.  they were closer to raw than cooked.  Bread basket is awesome but beware it doesn't spoil your appetite.",

    "text": "STOP READING, JUST EAT HERE!  OK, I'd be skeptical too, so here goes:  I went to this restaurant based on earlier Yelp reviews.  It seemed strange to me that a steakhouse buried in a run of the mill casino would be rated so highly but we decided to give it a shot.  We were rewarded big time.  This was the best meal I've had in years, period.  It truly felt like five-star dining, from food quality to food quantity to atmosphere to service to value.    We ordered the porterhouse for two for $59.  It also came with clams/mussels, salad and four accompaniments.  SPOILER ALERT:  There were a few amazing touches that really made the experience.  After we ordered, we were brought a small sample of filet mignon to what our appetites.  It was absurdly tender and flavorful, and came with an unbelievable porcini mushroom sauce.  Later, there was a mango sorbet intermezze.  The coup de gras was that they actually cut the steak for us into small strips (about 1 inch by 3 inches), picking the bones almost totally clean!  Finally, even though we didn't order dessert (no room!), we were brought delicious cubes of espresso chocolate.  Oh yeah, unlike most restaurants that gouge for little things like sodas and substitutions (if they even permit them), we were charged $1! for soda with unlimited refills, and nothing for a substitution of a salad that cost $1 more.  This is that rare restaurant that truly understands customer service, and strives to provide not just a nice meal, but an \"experience\".",

We went to the casino that this was located in, and my girlfriend remarked that the spot was a diamond in a nicotine filled desert.  I think that's accurate.  The casino itself isn't much, and this place is definitely a nice find in the middle of it.  It outclasses its surroundings which is great.  We took a look at the menu, and were shocked a the value to be had.  Our waitress remarked, \"Honey, we're inexpensive not cheap!\"  Definitely True.  The food was pretty good, we both got the filets.  My filet was the right temperature, but my girlfriend's was a little rare, even to the point of being blue.  The service and the deserts were fantastic.  I really had a great time here, and I think the prices were great but the incorrectly cooked steak knocks a star off.  We will be back again!  Our favorite deserts were the strawberry shortcake, and the royal flush....  Mmmm",

Order burger only to be presented with a Frozen Pre made starfish shaped patty with factory grill marks! Truly disgusting burger couldn't finish half of it due to rubber like texture and lack of seasoning.  Should have returned to kitchen and had it taken off bill. I definitely would never recommend this place for a burger. Waffle fries were good just avoid burger at all cost.  All other food at Cholla is very good overall Amazing steaks. Not sure if all burgers from Cholla are always pre frozen or if I was just the unlucky one that night? Haven't been back since",

When we walked away with a winning, we decided to have a nice dinner at Cholla. A couple of the friends with us told myself and my boyfriend that this was the place to go. After arriving at 4:30 (tried to keep it an early evening) we were told that the restaurant was not open yet. We asked if we could hang out at the bar for a half hour prior to the restaurant opening.  The hostess said yes and my group proceeded to have a couple drinks and shots. When we were escorted to our table for dinner, we were told that one of the guests could not order a cocktail or he would be thrown out.  One girl even ordered a martini and got a margarita. The service was terrible!!  After appetizers (which were horrible) we tried to order more cocktails and were denied. After being escorted out of the restaurant for trying to order cocktails (beer really), we were forced to leave the casino as a whole. There was security waiting for us the the entrance of the restaurant. Long story short, if you want to come for a nice dinner and gamble, don't plan on drinking.",

Honestly, I am not just saying that.  I have traveled the world and always try to find a great steak wherever I go.  Previous to this steak, my favorite was a little place in Australia.  The steak served at Cholla's was absolutely amazing.  Great flavor, very tender, and cooked to perfection.    Do yourself a flavor - go to Cholla.",

Shrimp and crabmeat cocktail was good.. and so were the stuffed bacon wrapped chorizo dates.  My ribeye steak was even better. I tried my boyfriend's scalloped potatoes they were creamy and delicious. Had I not been so naughty with food this past christmas season, I would have easily devoured the whole side of potatoes.. but too bad my conscious got the better of me this time. The complementary piece of fillet when we sat down was great, and so were the complementary bacon cornbread+bread basket.   Cholla's also gave us a small scoop of the sorbet as a palate cleanser which was a nice touch. For the price this place is legit. Honestly, the food, the service can't be beat.",

After last night, my husband said \"Hands down this is my fave!\"  That is saying a lot for a man who loves red meat.  We were celebrating our anniversary with a week of eating out-no better tribute!  Love this cozy romantic spot.  Sami was our server and he made sure this special eve was a True celebration.  We ordered the Special, a 32oz Porterhouse with Caesar Salads to share and two sides for each of us!  Whaaaaattt???  We both had the Broccolini and Au Gratin potatoes.  Both were perfectly cooked, which is often not the case.  The steak was divine!  Medium rare and tender as the day is long.  Our Joel Gott Zin was just the perfect accompaniment to the meal.  With a complimentary amuse bouche of filet and a sorbet palate cleanser-it was an over the top meal at very reasonable pricing.  Sami made sure to add icing to the cake by delivering two complimentary desserts-a Creme Brulee' masterpiece and Chocolate cake. We were over the moon with happiness!",

Spring Training had just started, most restaurants were booked but luckily Cholla had availability so I booked and had a fantastic experience. The casino itself may be a bit of an eye sore, however the restaurant is charming and really nice.  It had an upscale feel without being stuffy. The prices were great, my rib eye was only $20! This is a steal compared to most steakhouses in Scottsdale.   The restaurant is small and quaint, nice white linen on the tables, and very attentive service.  I really appreciated all of the small details, like the yummy sorbet which was the 1st course, and oh my goodness, the chocolate truffles we received after we ate- all kinds of yummy!  My only suggestion/constructive criticism is that the tables are too close to each other. We could hear the whole conversation of the people in the table next to us. Other than that, everything was really great.  I will absolutely be returning.",

What I will say is that my co-worker and I both ordered steaks medium-well, and that's why I'm deducting a star.  I got through most of my steak and then it just became medium-rare.  My co-worker had much less luck.  He took a bite which was medium well and then, he too, had a medium rare if not rare cut.  He sent his back and when it came back, he took another bite which was solid and then again, medium-rare.  Not sure how that's even possible, but it was.  A shame.  The food, especially at the price point, should be done with care and this was not.  The desserts were the best I've ever had.. I had the molten lava cake and it was well worth the 20+ minute wait.  The sides that we ordered were also very good, I especially enjoyed the corn that we ordered.    But honestly, had they not under cooked our entree, it would've be a solid 5.  Don't expect it to be a cheap night.  Our party of 3 had a near $360 bill not including the tip and only one bar drink was done. For the price you pay, you should expect the food to be done right the first time and there isn't any excuse as to why it wasn't done right the second time.",

From then on the service was excellent: drinks, warm bread with butter and pesto sauce, and a surprising amuse bouche of filet mignon. My husband had intended to order a New York strip steak but was intrigued by the Elk chops on the special anniversary menu that included two sides and a wedge salad. I ordered the lamb chops and substituted mint jelly for the spicy yogurt. The waitress offered to split the salad. After the salad we were brought scoops of raspberry sherbet as a palate cleanser. The main courses were delicious and perfectly prepared. The birthday boy was offered the dessert menu and he chose chocolate cake. It came with a candle and a chocolate birthday card. The whole dining experience was wonderful, great food and excellent service. The prices are too good to be True. We are already planning to come back to try other items on the menu. Thank you to everyone for making my husband's birthday memorable.",

This is a very small restaurant, seating for only about 50 people, including the bar. Full menu is served in the bar. We didn't have a reservation but lucked into seats at the bar. Brent, the bartender, was extremely kind and helpful. The wife had the Elk and upgraded her sides to the creamed corn casserole, I had the lamb. Both are farm bred in New Zealand and both were delicious. My sides were the brocolini and garlic mashed potatoes. Appetizer was the calamari, very good with a slightly sweet taste to the breading. Dessert was an apple galleta. We would gladly recommend the restaurant and very much recommend Brent as server and bartender. Dinner was very inexpensive, under $100 with drinks included. Definitely will return when we get the chance.",

It is the filet mignon with shrimp and your choice of two sides. We all ordered our filet mignon medium and only one of them came out medium. The other 4 were medium rare. That was the only issue we had with our entire experience. The 4 of us that were served medium rare filets have eaten them that way before so we didn't make a big deal out of it. The sides we ordered were garlic mash potatoes, lobster mash potatoes, asparagus, and a baked potato. The lobster mash potatoes were amazing. The rest of the sides were very good. The other thing that we found incredible was the price. The full house was $28. The amount of food you get is such a great deal.

They never fail to amaze me any time we go. Two thumbs up",

We did not order any starters as our server confirmed that the amount of food that comes with the entrees would be plenty and boy, was she right. The complimentary bread, amuse buche and pallet cleansing sorbet were great. My husband ordered the filet and I ordered the NY strip. Both were very flavorful; he upgraded to the corn casserole and i got the au gratin potatoes and carrots.  If anything, we found the sides to be a little under seasoned. We had a bottle of wine with dinner and finished off sharing the chocolate cake which was wonderful. Very reasonable for the quality of service and food received. We will be back again!",

I do appreciate that the restaurant is enclosed, because it is right off the casino floor & I would not have enjoyed the smoke while trying to eat.   My boyfriend & I both has the NY strip with a salad appetizer, I had the wedge (which is their house salad). The bacon on top looked extremely cheap, I kept calling it Subway bacon, because it looks like the type of cheap bacon Subway would have. The dressing was a blue cheese bacon which was good, but the lack of quality bacon was a little off putting. My boyfriend liked his Caesar & had no complaints. Also we both has drinks, I had a house wine (under $6 a glass) & he has an amber bock (under $5 a glass), so those prices were great.  They forgot to bring the bread everyone raves about. When we asked out waitress about it she apologized & it was brought out ASAP. The bread was okay. Next our meals, the steak was really good & cooked per my medium rare request. The sides, broccolini & mashed potatoes were both good as well.  Overall I would return & recommend it to others. Great meal at a good price with attentive & friendly service.",

I ordered the bacon wrapped filet with a potato.  They offer a sauce for the filet too.  I asked for it on the side.  The filet was good and did not need any sauce.  It was cooked to perfection also.  The bacon was crispy too.  The potato was baked and really good also.  The cake desert they served was also really good too.  These types of steak meals remind me of my childhood out hunting, fishing and or varmint control.  Grilling a good cut of meat with a baked potato was the best.",

I've eaten here at least 20 times and have never ever ever been disappointed until tonight.  I was in a hurry to catch a concert or I would've complained and sent it back.  First of all the bread, and shrimp cocktail was great as always.  Service was fine!  The Lobster tail, Ribeye Steak, Broccolini and Au gratin potatoes were really bad tonight.  You can tell in the pic how undercooked and lifeless my Lobster tail was, tasted gummy and horrible.  The Ribeye was flavorless and nowhere close to medium rare.  Potatoes were flavorless and undercooked and the broccolini just had zero flavor.  I had the steak boxed up as I think I can season it at home and throw it on my grill at home tomorrow for lunch and at least salvage it in some capacity.  Not sure if there's new mgt or new cooks in the kitchen or a combo of both.  Again just not what I've been accustomed to dining here for several years!

I ordered the ribeye and it was one tender and ultra well seasoned piece of steak!  The au gratin potatoes were fabulous and broccolini is always a plus.    Pros: - classy and beautiful ambiance  - staff was wonderful and great to our baby (we felt bad bringing her to a fancy place from the start but they were accommodating and loved her) - the bread selection before dinner is amazing. Of note are the pepperoni bread and the bacon corn bread in a mini cast iron skillet! - between meals they gave us mini sorbets as palate cleansers. Like I said, royal treatment for affordable price. - complimentary macarons after dinner!  Cons: - it is inside the Casino Arizona so you have to trek through the thick layer of smoke to get to the restaurant. - reservations fill up fast so difficult to get in on weekends - chocolate cake had very hard and therefore difficult to eat frosting. Only food complaint but it's forgive-able.    Overall, amazing experience and taste for the price.",

    "text": "How could I not give 5 stars when I get served a piping hot bloody and well seasoned ribeye over garlic mashed with broccolini, all for $20.  First they start with chewy artisan bread with butter and an amazing pesto dip.  Then they finished me with 2 tiny but delicious macaroons that were cold and yummy.  No way you say, can't be right?  I have paid Ruth Chris, Peter Lugar outrageous sums for their steak that's triple this, and I am coming back here for more.  Chollo's is nicely tucked in Casino Arizona, its quiet with just the right sound level of jazz music, service 5 star with the bartender knowing his menu well.  This has got to be a secret, and one of Scottsdale & Phoenix besr steakhouse!  I salute you.",

We have eaten here 5 times now, and every time has been nothing short of perfection. They start off by bringing you a dish sample (compliments of the chef) and warm hand towels. Then they bring the best hot/fresh bread I've ever had  after the bread they bring a scoop of sorbet to cleanse your pallet before the main course comes. We had the porterhouse for 2, came with 2 Caesar salads, two sides a piece and house made steak sauce. It was OUTSTANDING! Can't wait to go back!",

The positive reviews for this place caught my attention,  but the prices on the menu really hooked me. Went on a Thursday night  (not busy at all, btw) figuring, OK, decent meal at a decent price, nothing more, nothing less. Let me tell you, this place absolutely BLEW ME AWAY!  Our server Sami was very pleasant and very attentive. The restaurant is small, nice decor, just fancy enough. The first thing you get is a small sample of steak, I think more to highlight their demi-glace sauce than anything else. Seriously, who gives an amuse-bouche anymore? Impressive! Sami then tells us they have a special that night - a 32 ounce porterhouse for two, two sides each, and two Caesar salads.  $49. No, that's not a typo. And, honestly, the normal menu items aren't much more than that. And the sides are included in the menu prices, which is a pet peeve of mine with fancy a la carte steakhouses.   Cutting to the chase: this was an absolutely excellent steak! Perfectly cooked, accompanied by bearnaise and demi-glace sauces, both very good. I had a potato gratin that was spot on!   Total for dinner and two drinks: $70! I wish I could give this place 6 stars just for showing that you can have a nice meal at a nice place without breaking the bank!",

    "text": "We were looking for a place to celebrate my granddaughter's belated birthday dinner and the rave reviews for CHOLLA made the decision for us.  When we arrived, we were graciously greeted.  The place is intimate and lovely.  I particularly liked their large semi-circular booths and the colorful, contemporary paintings.  Really eye-popping art that is truly pleasing.    We had reservations for 7PM but they were not ready for us so we waited by the bar/lounge.  It wasn't long until they called us to our booth. Yes, a booth.  I love a booth!   Once we ordered, they brought us an \"amuse-bouche\" composed of a cube of beef with blue cheese/bacon topping.  Very delicious-- a virtual party in our mouths.  We were also served a basket of breads including a salami bread, cranberry bread, pumpernickel, and a small cornbread topped with bacon which was presented in its own mini-skillet. These were accompanied by a absolutely delicious pesto and swirled butter.  For an appetizer, we ordered the cheese plate which came with several  cheeses,  a spicy salami, candied walnuts, grapes, and a variety of olives--an appetizer that pleased everyone.   We were served a palate cleanser of lemon sorbet before our entrees arrived.  Nice touch.  The mains were the Lamb chops served with a baked potato and broccolini and the filet mignon with potatoes au gratin and grilled asparagus. The filet mignon was cooked to perfection and the au gratin was so cheesy it was like eating your favorite version of mac and cheese. The lamb was also perfectly cooked and was a very ample portion.  I had the shrimp BLT which consisted of two mini buns with 2 shrimp each with lettuce/tomatoes and bacon, with a large serving of waffle fries.  I didn't want to eat all that bread so I ate the shrimp (which were perfectly grilled) with the lettuce and tomato as a wrap.  For those of you who don't want too much bread, you may want to avoid this dish.  The waffle fries were really crispy and delicious.   The birthday girl got a huge slice of chocolate cake and Sami our server accompanied us in singing Happy Birthday to our precious granddaughter.  The sweet granddaughter, however, refused to share one bite of that humongous piece of cake.  She reported that it was absolutely amazing.  The chocolate mousse we ordered was good, but average tasting.    All in all our first impression of Cholla in terms of food and service is 5 star all the way.  The management is polite, yet friendly and Sami, our server did a wonderful job of pacing our meal and taking care of our needs.  There definitely will be a return visit.",

I found Cholla on Yelp and was glad we had the opportunity to try it. They provided bread and cornbread along with butter and pesto butter. The pesto butter is a must try. We started with the wedge salad which was good and had a nice presentation. Between the salad and our main course, we were served lemon sorbet to cleans our palette. This was an unexpected surprise and very nice. I ordered the filet mignon and husband ordered New York steak strip. Each entree comes with two sides. The New York steak strip was delicious with lots of flavor. Since I can't have raw meat with the pregnancy, I asked for my steak to be medium plus but it turned out to be a little over cooked. Nonetheless it was good. We both asked for the sauce to be on the side so it wouldn't ruin the flavor our our steaks. Make sure you make a reservation.",

The staff is so friendly and accommodating, every single item of the menu incredibly delicious, and not to mention probably the best value for your money that you will find at steakhouses around the valley!  The bartender is the nicest I have met in Phoenix, and his homemade watermelon vodka martini was fabulous!  To top it all off, they even included free dessert (a perfectly made creme brulee) for my birthday; what a thoughtful, nice surprise to end my special day!  We will definitely be returning and recommending Cholla Steakhouse as a \"must try\" restaurant of Phoenix. : )",

A co worker was in town and he was try to fine a reasonable steak house \"Bulls Eye\".  The surrounding casino is small and compared to most I've been in here in Arizona not bad.  The space it's self is small / cozy i think only 16 or so tables. From the time you were greeted until the final note I felt I was in a high end steak house.   I won't repeat all the great things from the little taste of steak, great bread and just great service, I'll focus on the items I thought were top rate.  Think of this place as a outlet steak house, same great food at a high discount.  The New York Strip with 2 sides included for $21 would have been easily twice that even in a mid range place, plus they would have charged for the sides !!!  The thing that really impress was the wine price.  I ordered a BV blend for 45.00, and when the waiter brought out a BV Tapestry I told him that had to be the wrong one.  We'll he doubled check and it was the replacement for the one on the current list, my comment \"Sold\".  In any store retail is around what they were charging in the restaurant, so whole sale price still a very small margin for one of my favorite wines.  All in all a diamond in the rough, high quality low price incredible service, and attention to detail.  You have to try this place you will not be disappointed..",

Someone wrote it was like Mastro's with outback prices.  Obviously they have never been to Mastro's.    First, you have to walk thru the smokey casino to get to the restaurant. The set up borders on diner with the exposed kitchen & extremely noisy bussing area, but then they throw in linen table cloths like its fine dining. Pick one- noisy bistro or quiet dining. The web site says dressy attire so we dressed up. Then it turns out we were dressed better than the hostess & many of the other patrons had on shorts & Capri pants. Again, choose what you are going to be & stick with it. We dressed for Ruth Chris not Sizzler.    Food was up and down. We liked the calamari & stuffed dates. The Caesar salad & bisque were good too as was the bread service. Again, another  identity crisis-  a warm towel service & amuse Bouche of meat & a sherbet (not sorbet) palate cleanser yet they didn't bring plates for the appetizers so we ended up using  our bread plates, which got all sticky & dirty & were never cleared. Steaks were fine but skip the gloppy mushroom sauce. Sides were ok but not wonderful. Dessert was a catastrophe. The brought out creme brulee which was not torched because \"the torch wasn't working\". Fine, then don't offer it! The kitchen should never have sent it out. Plus the custard itself was grainy and goopy. The royal flush had artificial raspberry glop smeared on the plate & was waxy. None of us ate more than 2 bites of any of the desserts.    We don't go to casinos because of the smoke smell, which we could smell in the restaurant. Talk all you want about their great ventilation system then come smell my dress. You also had to exit the restaurant & go into the casino to use the restroom.    We all agreed we would never go back. Don't confuse this place with fine dining. It is not. It is cheap food & you get what you pay for.",

We both got the filet with shrimp and thought the steak was a bit salty.  But overall, we enjoyed our food.  You don't get 5 star food here since the prices are not as high as normal 5 star steakhouses (i.e. Mastro's).  The reason for 3 stars is for the bad service we received.  The restaurant was not busy when we dined (7:30pm).  We had Santiago as our server.  He was not mean, but not friendly either.  He made no recommendations to the menu even after we told him it was our first time here.  He never checked on us.  We had to flag him down each time we wanted to order.  Terrible service for such a special night.  Even with the reasonable prices of this restaurant, we will not return.",

The restaurant itself is quiet and not smokey, but the walk to get in from the freshair is brutal on your lungs.   Waiter was Santiago. Got our drink order wrong (1/3 right), was not able to answer our questions, and was not attentive at all.   Ordered the full house- filet and prawns. They were not prawns, they were small shrimp. Filet was good for the price.   App was the shrimp and crab- tasted like crab out of a can that had been sitting out.   Overall decent place but needs improvement.",

Would have rated 5 stars but the ambiance was a little too \"casino-ey\". Many of the patrons were loud and a bit obnoxious for this quality restaurant. Additionally, the entrance was congested with the buffet  crowd waiting in line for the casino buffet. Bottom line is that the meal and service was great. They even brought me a very nice birthday piece of cake with a candle. Recommend this place just be pre-warned that it is in a casino.",

Sat at the bar and had quick efficient service. There was  a smoker at the bar but i moved to the far end of the bar and didnt smell it. Spinach salad and the most awesome NY strip steak EVER! Seriously, this was worthy of a $30 price tag but these guys charge $21 Well worth the trip!",

It just didn't need it- the steak was good quality, perfectly salt & peppered and cooked between medium rare and medium (my preference) it was perfect all by itself.  My husband and I have spent $100-$350 on dinner before and this meal easily topped all of them.  The fact that we walked out of there for $96 uncluding a well deserved 35% tip... amazing.

    "text": "This is perhaps the best deal and one of the best steakhouses I've been to anywhere, not just in Arizona. A gem, hidden in the back of the Casino Arizona is small and easy to miss, but shouldn't be.   My wife and I went for a mini-date, a casual evening with some delicious steak and low minimum gambling (I taught her how to play Keno) and could not have been more impressed or pleased with the experience we had.  She ordered the Filet and I, the New York. The meal started off with a tenderloin ceviche, courtesy of the chef- the meat was tender and perfect and the ceviche had great flavor and I knew we were in for a treat that night. Then came the bread and my goodness was it good. There was quite the variety and of note, there was a pepperoni roll which was not overly greasy and went splendidly with the pesto dip which was offered in addition to the butter. Then came a small taste of blood orange sorbet (also delicious) which cleansed the palate for what was to come next.  Next came our steaks, which I won't say were the best steaks I've had in Phoenix (that honor goes to Donovan's so far) However, the portion was generous, the steak did not have pieces of tendon, not did it have large chunks of fat. It looked the way a steak at a high end restaurant is supposed to look and easily could have been presented as a 40-50 dollar steak without my batting an eye. This steak was only 22 dollars (her filet) and 21 for mine. That deal really can't be beat or matched. The steak was cooked properly, was high quality meat and had good flavor. The only negative I would say is that the desert actually quite bad. We had the creme brulee- rather than save you the eyesore I would just say don't order it- the menu gives False description- there is no balsamic foam, the custard is partly liquid, the sugar crust is too thick, and burned. If the steak wasn't so delicious and at such a generous price point the desert alone would have decreased my rating but the steak is too good of a deal not to get a 5 star review- just get your desert elsewhere.",

No bathroom in restaurant either. Waste of 200 bucks.",

The bread had burnt crusts and was stale when delivered to the table; the Bloody Mary was nothing but tomato juice and some condiments; the entree was not cooked as ordered - very rare and under-cooked; the shrimp was over cooked with char on it but it was cold when delivered to the table; the asparagus and broccoli was not cleaned properly so there were woody stems that were served; I was not able to eat but one bite of the filet without having to spit out the gristle; and lastly I had to keep my coat on since it was so cold.    I do not know how things changed so drastically but I am so disappointed that I no longer can consider this as my go-to restaurant.",

While it is right in the middle of Casino Arizona, once you are inside Cholla it doesn't feel like a casino anymore.  Warm decor and draped windows block views and most sounds from the casino floor.  Service was friendly and attentive (thank you Sam).  The meal came at a good cadence...not too much waiting and not rushed.  Started with bacon wrapped chorrizo stuffed dates (yum).  My wife had filet that cut like butter.  I had ribeye.  Both were very good  and cooked perfectly.  Overall a great experience.  We wanted to splurge a little for our anniversary.  But prices were very reasonable for a meal of this quality so we'll be back soon!  Probably should make a reservation as this is a fairly small (cozy) space.",

Sami brought us extra breads (at no charge), extra macaroons (at no charge), a lemon sorbet to clean our pallettes (at no charge), and warm towelettes twice.

As for dessert, usually were too full, but when we have partaken, it has been great.....usually split dessert if we can even think about ordering it.  Brent, the bartender, has been there for years and is a great, sincere conversationalist and an extremely knowledgeable bartender.  He pours top shelf booze as the well!  Forexample, well vodka is, I believe, Kettle One, and whiskey/bourbon is Jack Daniels.  Never used to need reservations, but now very popular...but you can make reservations online for small tables.

The food was AMAZING, the service superb and the level of detail so refreshing.  The wonderful little goodies in-between courses was such a nice touch.  Four of us had chateaubriand (mine was rare the other was medium rare) and it was the best steak I have ever eaten.  Now I am a bonafide foodie - big time.  My husband and I are going back often.

    "text": "It was my pre birthday celebration so I felt I was deserving of a nice juicy steak. Upon looking on yelp for one which that was not too far away. I came across the Cholla. I read some good reviews and one of the reviews which stood out the most was the fact that it's not too high priced. When I actually ate there I shortly realized why. I first walked in and wanted to sit at the bar but it was full of smoke which is understandable because it's located inside a casino. So I got a table and since it was almost my bday price was not an issue. I ordered the calamari which was crispy and well spiced but nothing to write home about. I also ordered the seafood bisque which I felt was vastly under seasoned. I even added salt, something I should never have to do to soups. Then I finally ordered the a ribeye which was good but not great but for $20 I can't complain. My real bone to pic ( no pun intended) was with the lobster mashed potatoes which was considered a premium side there because it took the place of two regular sides. This order has me very disappointed because it quickly reminded me of boxed mashed potatoes that were again under seasoned with cheap lobster meat on added to it. It was so pasty I thought I was in grade school again. But overall service was good, with very nice people.",

    "text": "Mhmm, what can I say about Cholla's? Atmosphere: the ambiance was relaxing and classy. You can come here for almost any occasion. We were there for my friend's birthday on a Saturday. Service: Great & attentive. From our hostess, who was friendly and funny, to our server, David, who was witty and helpful, to the kind people who filled out water glasses. The service here was good, keep up the good work. Food: i ordered the chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon as my appetizer. They were so tasty, the only con is that they only served 3 dates. Ugh, no enough I wish it were 5 dates instead. I took a while to order my entree, even though I did my research on the food prior to coming here. I ended up ordering the ribeye steak with asparagus & potatoes su gratin. The potatoes were okay, I really wanted to try the creamed spinach, maybe next time. The asparagus was great. Now the ribeye steak was amazing! I normally do not eat steak, but I decided to eat it that night because I was at a \"prime steakhouse\". The porcini mushrooms, brandy pepper cream tasted great with my well done steak. I wish I could have eaten it again. The food was fantastic. Miscellaneous: They gave my friend a complimentary slice of chocolate cake for her birthday with was nice. In between our appetizers (including the various breads and yummy corn bread), they served us complimentary sorbet, which was tasty and complimentary pistachio covered chocolate truffles at the end of our meal. Overall, I would definitely come here again for a nice steak dinner with an appetizer for under $30.",

We then split the Cranberry Spinach Salad which was awesome, the candied cashews is a great addition to the salad.  Our main entree was the Chateaubriand for two.  It is a 16oz prime filet, it melted in our mouths!  The lobster mashed potatoes were also incredible!  Can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "This is my 100th review and I was wanting to save it for an extra special place....so here it is and below I'll reveal why I love this gem of a place.   We came here for the 1st time for our 9th anniversary and it did not disappoint. We had never been here before so I called in to make a reservation. They were pretty booked a few weeks out BUT worked with me since it was for a very special occasion (at this point I am already pretty impressed). We got an early reservation, which turned out to work perfectly for our night.   The restaurant was located inside of the casino. The ONLY downside is that it is a little smoky on the way there but there was NO SMOKE at all in the restaurant. It was very classy and modern inside with some ol'school twists in decor like the Mad Men style (mid-century mod) booths and tables that were impeccably clean and all done up by someone with my type of OCD tendencies...everything in the same spot, all the hems were even all the ironing was the perfect. We got there a little early and they opened the restaurant and offered us a seat at their bar.   The bar tender was knowledgeable and friendly. He followed our lead and conversed with us. He had quite the selection of rum and whiskey, so my hubby was happy. The drinks were served beautifully. They also carried our drinks over once our table was ready.   There were several people waiting on us, some one for drinks, our server, some one clearing the table, yet we NEVER felt like our conversation was interrupted. They were all very observant.   Our dinner came with breads made on the premises, one was like a stromboli, a beautiful cornbread with fresh kernals and bacon served in a cast iron skillet and various other options with butter and a pesto butter i swear was made in heaven (it was whipped and I like how that consistency melts in your mouth). We also ordered a fruit, meat and cheese board that was served with about a lb of candied walnuts. This was basically enough for a meal so we asked to take the remainder home to enjoy over some wine.   They serve an amuse bouche here of fillet with a beautifully savory demi glace...Bravo chef! It was delish. I definitly ordered steak. We then recieved a raspberry sorbet to cleanse our pallet and warm towels to get ready for our main course.   I asked for the ribeye med rare with asparagus and brocolini...AMAZING. well seasoned and cooked exactly as I asked for it. The portion was generous and I ate the whole thing because I could not stop myself. The presentation was gorgeous and made me excited to try it. My husband got the special of Elk ribs cooked rare with a very savory and slightly sweet chambord sauce. WOW, it was amazing. Elk is quite lean (hence ordering it fairly rare) and they executed the order to perfection. It was succulent, well seasoned, perfectly cooked (bone in so it was beautiful) and the sauce was a nice complement to the game without being overbearing or masking the harmony of flavors.   We were then surprised with dessert on the house for our anniversary. I am not a dessert person so my hubby picked the old fashioned chocolate cake. It has maybe 15 layers alternating cake with ganache. It included a chocolate plaque wishing us a Happy Anniversary. I had a tiny bite of this heavenly dessert....it was ice cold and served with cold forks (purposely close no doubt) and the minute it made contact with my mouth it melted into a chocolaty pool of rich chocolate flavors and textures. I was a pastry chef, this was amazing cake.  I don't like eating desserts out and would come here for coffee and cake-- for anyone that knows me well, this speaks volumes.   They were kind and wished us an amazing night. Well, they helped to make it amazing. I cannot wait to return and try new dishes.  This will be our new spot for special occasions.",

First of all, they bring you some little samples of deliciousness for free which you haven't asked for. They brought us a sample of filet mignon and a sample of lemon sorbet. Both were perfect. Also, they bring three different breads, which two of them are super yummy, with butter and a pesto butter dip on side. We ordered wine. It was so smooth. For enteree we ordered filet mignon and blackened ribeyes. Both of them were really delicious.They came with two sides of choice. Au gratin potato was perfect. The prices are also fair. Our waitress was super friendly. And finally because of our birthday, they brought us dessert on house. My experience in this restaurant was terrific. You should try this place, you won't regret it.",

First thing that came to mind was the wonderful, greeting staff here. The one person that stood out was Skylin (hopefully I spelt that right haha), she was mega friendly,  caring, and made our experience wonderful.   Filet mignon, rib eye, shrimp, creamed spinach,  lobster mashed potatoes and the desserts were simply incredible. I would not change anything from our visit to Cholla. If back in Arizona area,  I would come back in a heartbeat.  Thank you so much for this memory that we will never forget.",

It was in a casino so I was skeptical at that already(I'm not a gambling man), but decided why not. I was not disappointed in the food one bit. The bread was fresh, calamari was on point and my steak was succulent but....I was unfortunately not treated like a well paying customer and did not have dessert because I never received a dessert menu after requesting one upon receiving my entree. Food was great unfortunately I definitely feel like everyone else served me well except my waitress. Still tipped 20% of bill though, usually do more but .",

    "text": "I am dumbfounded by the high ratings. We were in town from California to celebrate family members' 70th anniversary. Yep, 70th! We wanted to make it really special. Moreover, there is nothing fancy in Maricopa.   The service: Really good. Super friendly staff.   The food:  BAD! We ordered three ribeye specials and rack of lamb. The elderly couple ordered their ribeyes well done. The other medium rare. As for my lamb, I wanted medium rare. To start, they gave us a sample of filet mignon and hot towels. The bread basket came with regular artisan, pepperoni, and bacon corn bread in a mini cast iron. STALE! The pepperoni bread fell apart and bit gritty. The corn bread was a bit undercooked and soggy; we used the spoon to eat it. The pesto was good with the regular bread.   We also ordered a shrimp and seafood cocktail. The shrimps were big and decent. The cocktail sauce was good, but there was very little crab with a lot of baby purple lettuce buried at the bottom of the martini glass. The special also included blue cheese wedge. The assault of blue cheese! Luckily, they gave us raspberry sorbet to clean the palate.   \"Creamy\" spinach and corn came in separate mini oval cast-iron cocottes. Cute! The \"creamy\" part is more watery with undercooked cheese on top. The spinach was bland! We thought perhaps the main course will redeem this bad experience so far.   The main courses:   Ribeyes - charred black! They couldn't even cut their meat! (See picture!). Literally tasted like charcoals. The medium rare steak was full of gristle and stringy. More blue cheese chunks loaded on top of the steaks. The lamb was raw, blood oozes into the plate, and cold in the center. No flavor! The garlic mashed potato was the only good thing on my plate. Asparagus was undercooked and stringy.   We ended the dinner with complimentary raspberry macarons. We told them that we were here to celebrate a 70th anniversary, not even an offer complimentary dessert. We saw numerous pictures of complimentary anniversary dessert.",

May have to go again in August. just to keep you up to date on this horrible place.  But a True, honest criticism...there is NO non-smoking area in this entire casino.  Not even in Cholla's lovely bar area.  I guess that's where I meant to award the 1 star.  The waitstaff could use a bit of training - this restaurant truly wants to be a 5 star, and almost makes it...just train the employees a bit more to 5 star service.  We had Chateaubriand...not nearly as tasty and tender as I expected, but still excellent and an excellent price.  And done just to our order.  Asparagus was wonderful - wish I had ordered a double helping.  The au gratin potatoes were a huge disappointment....need to get the cheese into the layers, not just on top.  The creamed spinach was wonderful as was the bread - especially the cornbread. (Next time, I ask for extra).  And the seafood bisque was wonderful!!  All in all, a fine experience.  I just hope they can make a few improvements and I'll be happy to give them another star!  And get the damn cigarettes out of the bar!",

    "text": "One of the best deals and food in the Scottsdale area,  we were not really sure about being located in the casino, the good thing is parking was easy and plenty of open spaces.  Walking through the casino smelled of lots of smoke and the sounds of slot machines,  as soon as we walked into Cholla, no more smoke it was a top notch steak house with a great ventilation system hard to believe a casino was only a few feet away.   We had a party of 18 people with some kids they did a great job of balancing the adults and kids.   The food was great, I had a tenderloin with veggies and a wedge salad.  The salad had great chunks of blue cheese and bacon. The steak was cooked perfect and very big for the price $22  Good bread and a pesto sauce to dip in.  You could pay more but not really get more than Cholla, it is small and comfortable so you may need reservations.  Enjoy...",

Topped off with shiitake mushroom sauce and parmesan mash potatoes! Yum-my! My husband had the filet mignon with mushroom sauce. They first brought out a little sample of it on a small bed of lettuce with demi glaze on it and WOW! It was crispy on the ends and cooked medium. Delicious! I'm definitely getting that next time or maybe the elk tenderloin! Mmmm! We had David as our server and he was top notch. He picked a nice wine for me to pair with my dinner and it was also heavenly with the chocolate truffles. Hope to get back here soon to try out more on the menu.",

    "text": "It's my birthday and I was looking and looking on Yelp to find the right place to enjoy dinner out with my sweetheart of 16 years!  After much looking at menus online, I finally decided on Cholla Prime Steakhouse that is inside Casino Arizona.  (I'm not much for casinos, but it's sooo close to home and why not try it?)          We got there right around 5pm when they open and were seated and greeting right away.  Each and every employee was very helpful and attentive throughout.  The menu was exactly as the website had shown (some restaurants are totally off on what they have online vs. in the restaurant.)  We each ordered steak meals.   I ordered an appetizer of Seafood Bisque.  OMG, I think it may have been the best one I've ever had!  Luscious, creamy and chocked full of shrimp, small scallops and crab meat.  Our server was Linda and she was so wonderful and was available and helpful and just perfect!  The manager, Joy, was checking in too and that made it even more special... sometimes we can't tell who is asking how our dinner is going.       We were served about 6 slices of three kinds of breads, along with a pesto and soft rounds of butter.  Very nice.  There was a sorbet in between the appetizer and the entree!  I can't remember when that's happened, it's been so long!  (OK, OK... we haven't been to an upscale place in a long while...)   But Cholla wasn't the Putting on Airs type of fancy... it was a very comfortable place to be, and being waited on as if we were in a place that charges twice as much!          My partner had the Full House which was a Filet Mignon with Shrimp and she chose garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus.   I had the Ribeye with asparagus and scalloped potatoes.  The meat was cooked exactly to our requests.  Everything was DELICIOUS!         Let me sing and dance about our truly truly delightful and scrumptious dinner at Cholla.  We will definitely come back with friends and anyone who will join us!",

First they bring out a sample from chef for you to try. After your first course they bring out sherbet. Which only fine dining establishments do. After dinner they bring hot towels to wipe your hands. Staff is on top of things. Always filling your water glass and bringing more bread.  The only problem is the restaurant is small.",

We ordered some fried calamari to start along with a bottle of pinot, then a couple of porterhouse steaks and the Chateaubriand for two.  Everything was done to perfection as ordered, and even the side dishes were quite tasty. The staff also brought out a hefty slice of chocolate cake on the house. My father who previously worked in meat inspection and grading said his porterhouse slab was one of the best steaks he's had it years!  The total bill came to only about $115 dollars!  You can hardly feed a family of four dinner at Denny's for that price, much less get anything decent. I see many return trips here.  Service was excellent and very professional; staff seemed to take the food and their service of it quite seriously.  And btw, I disagree with other reviews about the buffet at Casino Arizona as not so good.  The gem of their buffet is the weekday dim sum, which is far better than most Cantonese restaurants serve--if you can even find another restaurant in town that serves it.  The rest of the buffet may not offer the biggest range of items, but in my experience everything is exceptionally well-prepared and the place is squeaky clean.",

    "text": "My family of 5 was on a vacation in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, and relied on Yelp for every meal for a week.  On our last night, we wanted to eat a nice steak dinner at a local restaurant that we couldn't find back home in Houston.  As I searched, I came across this restaurant that had only 11 reviews, but awesome ratings.  I was a little hesitant and skeptical that the reviews may be from employees since there weren't that many, but went anyways.  It was hands down, the best meal of our stay in Arizona.  It may be our favorite steakhouse ever...and we live in Texas, so that's saying a lot.  The restaurant is located in a smelly and smoky casino, so you have to endure walking through that on your way...but just plug your nose and press on, because it's worth it!  The service from the hostess, manager, servers and chef was superb from start to finish.  They treated us as if we were royalty (as they did with the other diners as well), and we couldn't have had a better experience.  Also, I couldn't believe the low prices for such amazing quality.  Our bill was $143 for a seafood appetizer, 5 huge dinners with fresh sides and dessert.  My husband and I have spent that on a steak dinner for 2 in Houston.  They start off with a big basket of different breads, whipped butter, and delicious pesto spread...but that's not all.  Then they brought us these adorable little cast iron skillets of southwestern cornbread.  After we ordered, they brought each of us a chef's tasting of filet to wet our appetites (oh so good).  Before our main course, they brought each of us a perfect little bite of sorbet with blueberries to cleanse our palette (my daughters were wishing for more).  Then after our main course, they brought each of us this delectable little white chocolate coconut morsel to end the meal.  Oh my word...all of it was fabulous.  We ordered 4 steaks, and each cut of meat was of such high quality, and can't believe how inexpensive everything was!  Here's what we ordered...  shrimp & king crab cocktail - scrumptious...and what's more, it was $9!  2 filet mignon w/ bernaisse sauce (one with grilled shrimp, one with lobster tail) - both cooked and seasoned to absolute perfection.  grilled salmon w/ oscar style sauce & king crab meat - delicious!  NY strip steak w/ caramelized onions and balsamic glaze - oh my word...to die for!  ribeye steak w/ mushroom sauce - the sauce was wonderful, and the ribeye cooked perfectly!  My girls are making fun of me for writing this mini novel of a review, but what can I say?  We loved it, and will be returning first thing if we are ever in Phoenix again.",

The waiter is so cool he knows we love this place! We always compliment the chief. My husband is a big critic when it comes to steak so eating here we have never experienced a bad sit in ever.

    "text": "Went to dinner with some friends, its quit the cute little steakhouse! They gave us cloths to wash our hands, a sample piece of steak (not sure on cut) with some Bearnaise sauce.. The bread was really good, we got some just plain bread and then some with pepperoni, as well as some cornbread with bacon. The cornbread was WAY too sweet and i didnt taste any bacon. We also got a lemon sorbet pallet cleanser before our meal.   My husband ordered the filet, and I ordered the the Rib eye... you get two sides with both meals. My husband chose broccolini, and the garlic mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes had a funky taste to them (i always seem to think this, not a fan of mashed at most restaurants, and it was fluffy like real potatoes as much as it was potato flakes.. like from a box, IDK though) I ordered the baby carrots and potatoes au gratin. My potatoes were soooo good, and the carrots were good. My steak came with a mushroom cream sauce, and it was cooked as i had asked (medium rare). However.... my steak was 1/2 fat... now i know that a rib eye is fatty cut.. but..... i would like to eat more than 1/2 my steak. The price is really good for what you get. The drinks are a little high priced... i had a glass of white blend and it was 13.50. One of the others i checked, the red blend was $10.50 a glass (this bottle retails for $10...) My husband had a normal 16oz glass of draft beer, and it was $9   I highly recommend you make a reservation since this restaurant is so small!   Since we live about 30mins away I dont see us coming here often unless we plan on a night of gambling.",

Would have ordered a steak but the waiter suggested the large  porterhouse  dinner for two for $49.95 which included two Ceasar salads, two sides each and a good size porterhouse. We ordered it Medium but it came Medium rare which was fine............it was delicious! For dessert we shared the Creme Brulee ($7.50) which came with a flourless chocolate cake layer underneath and some berry <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdecoration.It&s=a11fc502df4c0de48e13df3e316533006b983dc4ff4696e146f252200e51cfc6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">decoration.It</a> was good but not great. The serving was  too small to share which was not expected since most desserts are usually too much for one person. All in all a really enjoyable dinner with excellent  service for a very reasonable price . Would definately go again!",

Steak was tender and cooked perfectly, shrimp and King crab cocktail was stellar, and the Chocolate coffee mousse was an unnecessary but wonderful indulgence.

You get a variety of bread for free with your meal and we even received cornbread as well.  Then they brought out a sample of steak and they brought a sample of raspberry sorbet shortly after that.  I ordered the filet mignon with a baked potato and asparagus and my date ordered the ribeye with a baked potato and carrots.  Everything was delicious and cooked correctly.  However, I plan to order a ribeye or strip next time because the filet mignon didn't fill me up enough.  This place is very nice on the inside and I highly recommend checking it out.

    "text": "Dinner last night was incredible! And so reasonably priced.  We started off with a small piece of filet and artichoke, compliments of the chef. There was a white sauce with a hint of horseradish on top and the meat was delicious. Then the bread was brought out. It came with whipped butter and a pesto dip which was so yummy. There was several different breads: a pepperoni roll, a wheat, and a slice with what I think were sundried tomatoes. The pepperoni roll was incredible and I am not normally a fan of pepperoni...  For appetizers we ordered the bacon-wrapped dates ($8) and the calamari ($7). The calamari was nice and crispy and the lemon pepper tartar sauce had a little kick to it. However, the clear winner of this round was the dates. They are stuffed with chorizo and a water chestnut, then wrapped in bacon and served with an amazing hoisin dipping sauce. The water chestnut added just the right amount of crunch and the dipping sauce was fantastic. These are a must-order!  Next, the bowl of seafood bisque ($7) I ordered came out. The manager warned me that it was a big bowl of soup but the size still surprised me! It was probably the best seafood bisque I have ever tasted, loaded with chunks of shrimp, scallop and crab that I could actually identify, unlike some that I have ordered in the past. At only $7 it's a steal! I had to box at least half of it up t leave room for my entree.  Next came a mini martini glass with a small scoop of orange sherbet to cleanse our palettes. I am normally more of an ice cream fan, but this was some of the best sherbet ever! I found myself wishing the scoop was just a little big bigger :)  The entrees were brought next. I ordered the filet with prawns ($26) and my friend got the lamb ($22). My filet was cooked perfectly rare and the bearnaise on top was to die for. The prawns sat on some tomato lime coulis which was great. My friend let  me try a piece of lamb and it too was cooked perfectly to medium rare. It had just the right amount of fat in the cut of meat. Our sides included broccolini (also cooked perfectly), au gratin potatoes (yummy), creamed spinach (not as creamy as I am used to but the crunchy topping really elevated it), and lobster mashed potatoes (with chunks of delicious lobster in nearly every bite, $7 upcharge).   At this point I was too stuffed to eat anymore, but my friend ordered the dessert special, a baklava cheesecake ($7). The round cheesecake had the sweet honey glaze on it and crunchy filo and nuts piled on top. I only managed one bite but the contrast of the cheesecake with the crunchy filo was amazing!  Finally, we were brought two small chocolate espresso cubes to finish up. I ate a bit of one and it was creamy and delicious.   All the food we were served was soo delicious and the best part was the price: Just over $100 WITH TIP.  I mean, we basically had an eight course meal for two people, so that is an incredible deal. Plus I was so impressed with the quality of the food. The filet was one of the best I have ever had, the seafood bisque was absolutely loaded with seafood, and I will dream about those dates until I can go back. This is a great gem of a restaurant.",

We ordered of $39 prix-fixe menu and were pleasantly surprised with the amount and quality. The food was excellent even it took a little bit longer to come out, but again 16 people ordered steak so... my coworkers were pleased with service as well. We definitely will be back next year.",

Fillet was amazingly tender, taste like $50 steak instead of $22 with 2 amazing sides.    I don't want to share because place is small, roomy but they only put couple tables in so privacy, great place for a date night you can wow your date :)   They even brought pallet cleanser sorbet. Nice touch :) and even though we had no room for their fantastic looking desert they gave us home made strawberry truffle thing,  awesome !",
