We went in, it took a few moments before we were seated (which is fine), I ordered a mimosa (lots of champagne! It was solid), we put our order in....and we waited. And waited. And waited. After 30 minutes, my man suggested we go elsewhere, but I wanted to give them a chance and the food sounded great! But when I saw people coming in, ordering and getting their food while we were waiting, I lost my patience. I paid for the mimosa and left. Waiting for that long for food (40+ minutes) and having no one check up on us doesn't warrant more than one star in my book. Beautiful interior, but idk what was going on with our food. Two stars because the mimosa was awesome and the bartender was so nice.",

I can't comment on the food because we left and went to the living room after being ignored for so long. The food and service at The Living Room was delicious and I would highly recommend The Living Room in Chandler.",

Yummy food, service is why no five stars...we got juggled around but we did get taken care of eventually. It was dead. Drinks should have been much quicker than the 5-10 minutes we waited. We both had time to use the restroom separately before the drinks arrived. Also, it was happy hour and we got charged full price. It also got taken care of but we should Not have had to deal w that.

For entrees I ordered the ribeye with wasabi mash potatoes and spinach Unfortunately this were we start heading down hill. My steak was not SEASONED at all no salt and pepper on the tables to try to save the steak and one half of the steak was over done while the other half was way under done. The spinach came in cup there was literally a tablespoon of raw garlic that wasn't cook in the middle of the pile now that was a surprise when I bit into that. It seem like they threw the garlic in to late when cooking the spinach. The wasabi mash was great but not hot at all more like room temperature. My wife ordered the shrimp with the vodka sauce. Once again the sauce was very BLAND but the shrimp was cooked perfectly. I will return to try out the breakfast menu hopefully we get some bold flavors.",

We had the Calamari and stuffed Peppers.  yummy bites! The second visit was during 'happy hour' it was quite busy and noisey. We could tell the kitchen was rushed when the Calamari was now  gooey and undercooked. They either rushed the cooking or didn't let the oil get up to temperature.  Our waiter brought the wrong wine and billed accordingly.  Luckily we caught the error (before he opened the bottle and before we signed the check) and they were very helpful in correcting the error.  I'd give them a second chance but go for drinks and not food when it's crowded.",

The food was delicious, and the ambiance was very nice. The one complaint was the place was a bit noisy, because there was nothing to dampen the sound. The owner assured us that they were aware of the situation and were working on remedying it. We tried the steak hoagie, the portobello caprese, the chicken breast entree, and the Meridiem burger. Everything was scrumptious, especially the sauteed spinach (we had seconds). We had such a positive experience, we're going to make this one of our go-to places.",

Went on Mother's Day and made a reservation via OpenTable. Showed up and they put us on the wait list along with everyone else. How can you take a reservation but not actually hold a table??  The hostess team at the front couldn't care less, very poor attitudes for front of house. Finally seated 45 minutes later. Our waitress was short with us and seemed swamped.  I get that it is Mother's Day, but staff up properly. There were a lot of people running around but it seemed disorganized. I've worked in restaurants, this place needs better management.   Food took one hour to show up. The table next to us had to get up and get their own silverware.  Crazy.   The chicken sandwich was basic and I'd put a dollar value of half of what they charged. Waffle fries were seasoned with some strange ingredient. How do you mess up waffle fries?!? My wife's breakfast nachos were subpar, too. Only my daughter's griddle cakes seemed on point.    Finally, the place is beautiful. Well decorated. But it is noisy. The acoustics are not good, there is nothing but glass and concrete, so the noise from other tables reverberates. Add to that some DJ guy that has no sense of volume control and you will have a hard time trying to carry on a conversation with the people at your table. When we asked if the music volume could be lowered, we got a quick, snotty \"No\" from our waitress. There are a lot of ways to say No, she needs to figure out how a good customer service person says No without coming off short and rude.   I had high hopes but this place is all flash and no substance. If I were a hipster looking to have a glass of wine with friends, this would be a good choice. As a sit down restaurant, it disappoints on so many levels.",

They do pretty solid bruschetta, We had like 3 different types and they were only $3 a piece on happy hour and of good size (real talk, Meridiem:  I love basil, but it doesn't really belong on the one with prosciutto.  Let the meat and cheese shine on that one.  Keep it on the caprese one though).    There were some middle-aged dudes with rhinestone studded jeans there trying to impress the younger female bartender by ordering the most expensive thing on the menu, which was a steak and potatoes which I initially scoffed at like a wiener...but it actually looked really well cooked, I was impressed.  The guys took like 2 bites and then asked for a box because they had no intention of eating it, they just wanted an excuse to pull out their AMEX and hope someone was impressed (they weren't..it was a gold AMEX, come on dude.  No one gets excited for anything less than a black card, sheesh).  And that leads me to the next question:  Is the clientele just a repeat of the upper-middle class faux-posh pseudo-cast of the Real Housewives of Chandler that tends to haunt everything in the Ocotillo area?  Sure, a little bit (so far).  There was a small smattering of the chalky-skinned burlap sacks of overly tanned makeup that take residence at The Living Room down the road, and the guys that look like they're hunting for those women.  But there's also a happy hour crowd, and random people that wandered over from the hotels, and the DJ helps bring the mood down about 10 years, so it's really not bad at all.  It's actually a solid spot for people watching and there are a lot of normal jeans and t-shirts type people there, and polo wearing folks that just got off of work down the road.  You're not out of place there no matter what.  But overall, the big questions is:  is it a good place to go?  And so far the answer is a resounding YES.  The prices are great considering how nice this place is inside.  $5 glasses of wine (a lot of them, even some local!) during happy hour.  Food at various price points, and they're not stingy (hopefully that doesn't change).  Decent music, great ambiance, some good drinks for cheap ($5 old fashioned poured so you actually taste whiskey before the ice melts).    Check it out while you still can, because there isn't much else near there and this place is going to stay constantly filled up for a while.    BRB, gotta go order the steak with my Silver Wells Fargo card and see if anyone is impressed.",

    "text": "Trying this brand new restaurant just opened in the last couple days. My wife and I stopped in mid-afternoon. There were several customers at the bar, but none at the tables.   My wife had the chicken breast over hummus with a salad and sauteed spinach. The chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy. The hummus paired with it perfectly. The spinach was outstanding, garlicky, nutty and buttery. The only slight complaint she had was that the vinaigrette was a bit too tart to pair with the rest of the meal.   I had two starters, the bacon-wrapped shrimp and Pop's meatballs.  Both paired very well with the Joseph Carr Cabernet Sauvignon.   The shrimp was awesome, cooked to perfect tenderness and wrapped in smokey, crispy, bacony goodness!  It was served with a buttery sauce and a tangy plum(?) sauce. Yummy!  The meatballs I thought were just ok. They had a very herbaceous taste, with a lot of oregano. That was the dominant flavor of the dish. The meatballs are served with a chunky marinara sauce and under a coat of melted mozzarella.   The place is very modern, with a mix of normal tables/chairs, some low chairs, and small sofa/table combos. It is all hard surfaces, glass walls, corrugated steel ceiling, and concrete floors. It will be very noisy with a full house. You might want to bring your ear plugs.",

Nice bar area.  That's about where it ends.  Cons:  The food.   Calamari - was super plain and tasteless. Having this on the happy hour will hurt them.   Chicken plate - was over cooked and uninspired.  Italian sub - was very plain. Similar to what you'd expect at a grocery store deli maybe.  The owner. Must have walked by a six or seven times it does not say a word. We were the only people in the restaurant. He sat at the bar with 2 laptops  I think when you're just starting a restaurant you should be engaging with customers and keeping a close eye on the kitchen.  The kitchen. Seems to be an afterthought in the design of the restaurant. They have a clear glass so you can see it and it seems like a small assembly line vs a kitchen. Kinda odd.  The staff selection: Now this is nitpicky but is it me or did they completely poach all of the staff from La Sala, Living Room and Rock Lobster to work at this place?",

HOWEVER it is very noise to the point that if the place is busy and your at a table with 6 or more people you will definitely have a hard time hearing the people at the opposite end of the table. Not even my teenage kids could hear each other at Sunday brunch when it was at best 50% occupancy.   TOO SMALL Sunday brunch food tastes great, BUT their 6\" breakfast skillets at $14 are TOO SMALL!!! I am not a large person just 6'4\" 200 pounds and I could easily eat 2 of them for brunch but $28 is a LOT to pay for Sunday brunch. They did taste great.   PLEASE fix the noise and price/portions and make this a 5 STARS must visit in Chandler.",

Two nights ago I ordered a Panko chicken/avocado sandwich and small dinner salad--it was a take out order.  Got back to the hotel room.  The chicken was burned on the outside and dry to the point it was inedible and I had to toss it.  The salad was a very small serving of lettuce--nothing else. Went back last night thinking it was a one-off bad experience, since the food had been good every other time.  Ordered my norm--a specialty salad with a piece of cooked salmon. Got back to the hotel...the salmon was not only cold, it was partially raw. Again, tossed my dinner. I was already in for the night and tired, so did not want to go back and have the order corrected.  I don't know what's going on in their kitchen...is there a different chef/cook?",

    "text": "Without a doubt the worst place I've eaten in chandler in the last 10 years.  Nice ambiance but the food quality was McDonald's level or worse and service awareness was poor.   I'm not a tough customer because I've worked in the industry when I was younger but it's obvious to me that this place won't survive without changing their business model to prioritize food quality and server training.  Good luck and if you read this Meridian I hope you take it to heart and actual change so you don't go under.  Specific Issues: Steak was rare... I ordered medium.   Eggs were completely cooked, I ordered over easy.  Side dish was not brought, I had to inquire twice.  Potatoes were over cooked significantly.  Food was cold, should have been hot.   Toast was not toasted.   Priced at $20 per head.   Quality at $4 per head.",

That didn't bother me too much, but I did find it odd. The service wasn't good or bad, just ok. The waitress was nice enough, but she wasn't able to provide any recommendations when asked and we hardly saw her. Where she excelled was in telling us what was no longer available on the menu and that list was pretty extensive. Also apparently they stop serving brunch at 12. If I'd known that I could've avoided the whole experience. The food we did receive was nothing to write home about either. I could've whipped it up in my own kitchen to be honest. Pork belly had no flavor, the eggs were over cooked, and the Belgian waffle was just sad. Not worth the $30 I had to pay, so I won't be back.",

Spacious patio, great decor and for our group of 10 people, we had comfortable seating inside. A few of my family members had been here for dinner and mentioned it was very loud and not good for large groups. They were sitting inside so when the weather is cooler, I would suggest sitting outside on the patio if you have a large party.   The 10 of us ordered brunch. It did take a good 45 minutes to get our food. The restaurant did not seem that busy either. The waiter brought out several of our plates but 3 members of our party did not get their plates at the same time. By the time they finally got their plates most of us were done eating.   I'd love to try this restaurant again but have a little concern on the overall service.",

He said he would look into it and about 10 minutes later he brought out the eggs. I would think with a menu with not many choices you would know what the order should look like. I will say the food was good when I finally received what I ordered. Maybe dinner has more choices.",

Finally our orders were taken ..... the American skillet with poached eggs and the grilled cheese/ tomato soup combo with waffle fries. The food took a while to come out and once it did the fries were cold and tough. The poached eggs in the cold skillet were hard boiled and the portions were very tiny for the price. Very disappointed and we won't be back .",

Our daughter ordered the kids French Toast sticks (they make from scratch which is flipping amazing!) the sticks were great! I had an egg white omelette with veggies and potatoes. My lunch there was good too, I ordered a Caprese salad and added a chicken breast. My only suggestion would be to have an even better priced Happy Hour. Their wines seem to be on the expensive side and Happy Hour doesn't make them that much more affordable. I'd like to see something close to Postinos pricing. I don't want to shell out $50.00 every time I meet my friends for a cocktail and snack during Happy Hour.",

Add the fried egg if you do try it though.   The inside of the place was nice looking. Customer service was great as well. I was able to get in and out for my lunch hour with extra time. I went at 12:00PM too. Figured it was gonna be slammed.  Side note: they have a pretty cool bar side too with a decent selection of drinks and things on tap.

We had the lobster corn dogs and the bacon wrapped dates for appetizers. I probably wouldnt order the lobster again, and I might order the dates again. Then I got the shrimp po boy for dinner. It wasn't your typical shrimp po boy. I found the bread dry and overwhelming so I wouldn't get it again. It also took a long time to get our meal. The appetizers came out in ok time, but we probably waited almost 25 minutes for our meal, and the restaurant wasn't even half full.  I'd probably go back for drinks and appetizers and the ambience. They had a nice outdoor seating area and the decor was cool, but the food and wait wasn't worth going for dinner again.",

The new menu is weird..bison, duck, bacon wrapped dates?! No regular burger,  no more gourmet grilled cheese..now the music. Used to have great music with great food and atmosphere.  GONE  I even had my surprise 50th birthday,  we spent thousands...i brought every visitor from out of town like tonight tho this spot,  not any more.  DISAPPOINTED!",

It was a huge portion of deep fried French toast shoved on a little tiny rectangle plate. Don't get me wrong... I'm all for creative plating, but it was a little impractical.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying we have been fans of Meridiem since it opened. This past weekend we were in around 830/9am for breakfast and the service was friendly but we had two issues.  1. When my baby started fussing I went to change him and to my surprise I looked in every stall and no changing table. I asked a server where theirs was and he didn't know so he asked a female server. She said they didn't have one. I knew it wasn't her fault but I reacted with surprise and was upset -where am I supposed to change my baby? Thank goodness she was kind enough and came up with an idea.. she took me to a private bathroom for private parties or the staff and asked if this would work. She pointed to a small end table or dresser and of course being a mom you just make it work. I appreciated her but couldn't believe a new restaurant in 2018 wouldn't have one, safe area to change a baby. I also want to be clear that there were at least 6 other families dining with young children - it's not like it's only a bar. I was very disappointed.  2. We ordered sliders and biscuits and gravy and it took over 50 min just to get our food. We saw other tables waiting just as long. Very slow for breakfast.  Again, we enjoy the food, the restaurant ambiance is nice, and the servers are friendly but the two issues above made it very hard to enjoy our dining experience last weekend.",

Came with a party of about twenty, had a reservation that was confirmed earlier in the day but when we showed up we weren't given the tables we required. Instead, they grabbed a couple of tables and put them together. Made it really hard to socialize and communicate with the rest of the party. We watched the same attendant/bus boy walk by with his hands in his pockets at least twenty times without even asking to take any glassware or plates from our table. Looked like a war zone at our table. Place is cool to have some drinks at if your at the bar inside, other than that this will be our last time coming to this establishment.   **Live music/DJ was trash!**",

    "text": "I was drawn to this place due to it's aesthetics and online menu, so I decided to try out. While it did have some strong points, I put a lot of emphasis on customer service. The customer serviced was a huge disappointment.   When I arrived at the location, I was immediately amazed by it. It is located on a remote plot of land. There are plenty of businesses, roads around there, but for some reason, this location didn't have very many large buildings around it, making it feel secluded and very open. The building itself is beautiful. It's trendy, modern, and open. It has varied seating including indoor/outdoor, high-top, low-top, bar, private area, lounge seating, etc. Whatever your mood, take your pick! They do have TVs placed tactfully throughout as well. There isn't a very clear pathway to the patio, so anyone wanting to go there will have to go through a bunch of tables. The bathrooms were set up in a neat layout.  I made reservations on Open Table for Sunday brunch, 11am. When we got there, the employee said they didn't have the reservation. It worked out for us since we got seated right away. It was busy, but it wasn't overly packed. I'm not sure if there was a system issue or whatnot.  It wasn't an issue at this point, but I can foresee this being an issue if a reservation is not found during a busy time.  Anyway, when we sat and looked at the menu, I noticed it was all lunch or dinner items. They call that menu the \"PM\" or \"Post\" menu. It took a while for our waitress to come around and when she finally did, we asked for the breakfast menu. They call it the \"Pre\" or \"AM\" menu. I noticed everyone seated after us had the same experience and felt it was weird the employees didn't check to see which menu we wanted or automatically give us the breakfast menu, since it was very much so in the morning.  The remainder of the service was slow and unimpressive. Everyone was very nice and helpful, but it was minimal, and it took a while for everything. When our food finally came out, the food was incorrect. My friend and I both ordered omelettes, and the food they delivered was a hybrid of our two orders. I received items I didn't ask for and hers was missing items. They took the appropriate steps to rectify the situation, but the overall experience remained lackluster.  The food options looked great, and I did enjoy my omelette, although slightly too greasy. The Peach Bellini is DELISH. Portion sizes are fair for the price. I did notice they have a happy hour, and I really liked the place. I hope to come back with a better experience.",

Rewind to this morning... had a few colleagues/friends text me that they were in town and would we like to hang out - they were staying in Chandler and I live in Gilbert. Been hearing about this place and wanted to try it out and coincidentally they were staying close by...  4 of us ended up stopping by... bunch of appetizers, few bottles of wine, a number of Tito's and soda and we closed the place down.  Ambiance - we started at the bar and then Ryan, an owner, that I actually knew from another lounge came by and said hello... he set us up outside on a beautiful night with a firepit and great couches/seating.  Service - They do a thing where they are team serving... so you don't necessarily get to know one specific server... and sometimes the coordination gets mixed up so their attentiveness can be spotty but this is a minor issue overall.  Drink and food - Good value here.. we ended up hitting the end of Happy Hour and ordering a bunch of appetizers that we shared. With the food and the drink the value was definitely there...  If you're down by Chandler Fashion Square, and looking for a place to hang out and get a bite... you should give this place a try!",

    "text": "I found this listing on Yelp. After seeing the pics and reviews, I was pretty excited. We came here to meet up with a friend for lunch on Saturday. It's a beautiful environment, with well appointed decorations. The staff are amazingly attentive and friendly.   We sat down to the Brunch menu (it was 12:30 & brunch went until 2:00). My other half couldn't find anything she could order, and they quickly let us know we could order off the dinner menu too.   After reviewing the menu, we all decided  to go with the Power salad. My partner changed out the feta cheese and asked if she could have romaine instead of kale. They gladly complied. Very nice.   So why the three stars do you ask? That salad we all got was so dry, overloaded with nuts and cranberries, and just plain boring. In fact, we were all shocked. I am unsure what is \"power \"about a cup of cranberries and a cup of almonds in a pile of dried kale, topped with another cup of crumbled dry feta cheese. And my partner's salad was a bowl of romaine chopped lettuce topped with a sprinkle of Parmesan and the same nut and cranberry mixture. We all ate quietly, because I think we didn't want to embarrass one another that the salad was so odd.  Again, mind you,  the inside facility was simply stunning with the decorations. As one entered into the female bathroom, there was a separate front area for washing one's hands that was simply lovely.  There was a painted saying on the wall stated \"How lovely you are!\"   These are all great touches! However, I actually came to enjoy the food. I was rather sad that I invited my friend to come here. But I didn't know until I partook. I've heard the drinks are really great here from our hotel staff. So I guess if I ever come back, that's all I'm Coming in for.",

The 1st time was shortly after they opened and they were closed for \"weekly inventory\"  That was a few months ago, so Tuesday night 3 of us from work decided hey lets give them another chance.  The service was spotty, but good when they came around.  Each of us had a cup of soup $5.00 each 2 Tomato \"Bisque\" and 1 French Onion and both types were very low on flavor.  The tomato soup which the staff all called a bisque was not rich or creamy.  We also shared the Tuna Poke Stack which for $12 was good, but they gave us very few wonton chips not nearly enough for the dish.  The Crispy Chicken Wings despite my friend asking for them to be EXTRA crispy were NOT crispy at all.  I ordered \"Mexican Street Corn & Crab Hushpuppies as an appetizer and for $16  I was VERY underwhelmed. There was maybe a spoonful of Mexican Street Corn as a garnish and some corn inside the very dry hush puppies.  As my entree I ordered the $12 Beet Salad which came in a build your own layout including two lumps of the goat cheese.  On to dessert to share we ordered a Rum Cake and Creme Brulee neither of which I would order again.  The \"Rum Cake\" was a lousy brownie with a hint of rum and overall just bad.  Creme Brulee custard was loose and lacked any real flavor.  The presentation of their food was very nice and the staff were all nice people, but in the end the overall experience was NOT very good.  3 people 2 teas a water plus the food mentioned above was $99.45 not including gratuity.  Overpriced and Underwhelmed.",

Beautiful location, but nothing stood out in terms of the menu and the customer service.  To be honest, I wasn't excited to go back.  Good thing I am able to admit when my opinion is wrong and when things have changed.  Because this place has changed in so many ways!! Brand new chef who is killing it!! The menu was so good and I was excited to hear that they are gonna be adding some more things that sounded absolutely delicious!!  Every dish we had was crazy good!! I could eat the Kung Pao Cauliflower daily!! The customer service was top notch and our drinks never ran low.  I am super excited to come back and  am already planning my next girls night out!!!",

The waiter did comp my meal.  The other people in my group seemed to enjoy their meals (sandwiches, soups) so perhaps those are better options.",

That's right ALL of us who made reservations were told to wait an additional 2-3 hours. So 11am got sat at 1-2pm. We happened to have 3 children with us, one of them being special needs which was explained when making the reservation, and still no accommodation. Even the owner went out of his way to avoid the clients and let his wait staff stand around and do nothing but take the brunt of people yelling at them. Customers were literally fighting in the lobby over reservations.   I should add we just rented this place out for a business function Wednesday.   I will add that after we were seated the food was good and the owner did go out of his way to apologize. Will give this place another shot.",

I had salmon with quinoa which was really good and husband had beet salad with the spicy chicken wings.  The issue was the price, very high for the menu.  Gave it a second try with my daughter, she had the salmon and it just tasted off.  I tried the peppercorn steak and again the taste was off, it had a taste of lighter fluid to me.  It was very disappointing.  Both visits occurred during 11 lunch hour.  The ambiance was nice but can't see myself going back again.",

Especially with the craft beer scene being such a big thing right now, I was very surprised by the limited selection. We ordered some happy hour food and it was delicious. The calamari was really good. Our server was very nice. There's just something that seems to be a bit of a miss at the Meridium.

Once we figured out how to get there we were pleased with the inside modern and open vibe. I walked into a fairly slow Saturday night which usually makes me nervous. However, I was greeted promptly and with enthusiasm! Drinks came quickly and the food was surprisingly good. Our waiter was well educated on the menu and gave some great recommendations. I had the power salad and added Ahi which was soft like butter and a great addition to the kale and seeds. The wine selection looked like someone knew what they were talking about for sure! A glass of Willamette Pinot balanced well. Overall, very enjoyable dining for a first time experience.",

Once there, we were impressed with the environment (open, airy, very inviting) but the place wasn't very busy.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was brand new but very sweet and engaging.  The menu on their website mentioned a portobello sandwich, but I didn't see it on their menu. They did have a Caprese salad and several other sandwiches. I asked the bartender and she said they had just re-done their menu.  I figured since they had a salad and other sandwiches it would be fairly simple for them to put some tomato and mozzarella on two pieces of bread for me. I didn't even need the portobello. I asked her if she could create one for me. She had to ask her manager and he promptly told her no, they could not make me that sandwich.   Seriously? You have bread, tomato and mozzarella currently on your menu!  We were really looking forward to coming back to this establishment but due to the lack of service, we will not come back nor will we recommend it to any of our friends.

I want to like this place so much that after it took a full hour for our food to arrive I asked to speak to the manager.  I let her know that an hour for lunch is going to be too long for people working in the area.  I understood since we had 9 people that it might be a little longer.  I know it's hard to get 9 people's food out at the same time.  So, I had ordered an appetizer.  Let's get some food in while we wait for our meals.  Except that the appetizer came out AFTER my meal.  So I mentioned that, too, and the manager was happy to box up my appetizer for me.  I didn't expect to get anything taken off my check (and I didn't), but for some reason, I DID expect for the service to speed up after my complaint.  Instead, it took 20 minutes for us to get our checks after we HAND-DELIVERED them to the staff since no one had come back to pick them up. I'm rolling my eyes at the fact that it took me an hour and 45 minutes to eat lunch today, and now I have to stay 45 minutes late at work to make up for their poor efficiency.  I fully expect this place to improve as they learn these things, I just personally won't be back for at least a few months.",

My husband and I came in with our 1 year old daughter for breakfast on Saturday morning. Our waitress was beyond awful. She spent most of her time chatting it up with one table in particular that looked like it must have been a couple of her friends. Took her 15 minutes to come back to take our order after giving us menus. When she did, she made some comment about being the only waitress which would be an okay excuse if there were more than just three other tables with people. The place was almost empty. At one point she walked over and refilled coffee for the table next to us and didn't bother to ask if we wanted any. She then offered to bring some bananas for my daughter which she never brought. My food came out before my husband's plate by at least 10 minutes. Our waitress came over and mentioned something about our food being on separate tickets which made zero sense. Seemed more likely that she completely forgot to put half of our order in which is insane because there were only two of us ordering. When his food did finally arrive with a measly \"sorry it took so long\", his waffle was all soggy. I ordered the acupulco skillet which said it came with \"cheesy potatoes\". In most places this means cheese on potatoes. Apparently at this place it means drowning in cheese sauce. Disgusting. Food is gross and overpriced and takes forever and service is awful. I regret my one visit and will never go back. Save your money and your time and go anywhere else!",

    "text": "Had lunch at meridien in chandler arizona on Tuesday with two friends. I had the powerhouse salad. There was no feta cheese so it was very bland. It looked like the romaine was wilted but it wasn't. It was a bland and flavor free salad. I asked for some bread hoping for a piece of French. I received a piece of white dry toast. My dining partner had the chicken sandwich. The chicken was overlooked and frightfully dry. We shared the bananas foster. It was a sloppy wet mess with chocolate sauce. It wasn't busy but it took a long time for our meal to arrive. There are so many delicious restaurants in the area that we will not return to meridien - ever.",

I had the salmon, grilled asparagus and sauteed spinach which was all excellent.  The decor is lovely, but unfortunately the concrete floors, wood, glass and other hard surfaces, although they look beautiful, lends itself to a very loud environment.  So loud, in fact, that my friend and I ate dinner and left rather than ordered another glass of wine. I look forward to going back and trying breakfast and happy hours again when the weather is nice enough to sit on the patio so I can enjoy a conversation with my meal.  I'd love to try other options on the menu as I really did enjoy my dinner and wine.",

However within 10 minutes our hostess, Ivy approached and said our table was ready. While Ivy's role was technically over after she seated us, Ivy went above and beyond to ensure our experience was everything. Unfortunately due to the chaos of a Friday night on a holiday weekend, after our server introduced herself - we almost never saw her after that. She seemed to have little control over her many tables. While we all attempted to get her attention and or flag her down, she kept rushing past us and was fairly rude about her level of busy. Thankfully, Ivy never took her eye off our table. She was the one who took our order, made sure everything came out as ordered, and never left us with empty drinks for long. And it wasn't just us - Ivy made it look flawless to continue seating people while always checking in on tables, refreshing drinks where necessary and making sure everyone in the restaurant was happy and content. I would typically be furious with a waitress who was so absent and careless but thanks to Ivy, we never wanted for anything.  I won't hesitate to return to Meridiem thanks to the treatment and service Ivy provided!",

Our waiter was extremely friendly and welcoming and asked if we had been there before, and we hadn't, and preceded to welcome us. I ordered the grilled cheese and WOW! It was so good, but I'm a stickler for chipotle mayo which this sandwich had. The bacon on it was just the right amount of crispiness and totally hit the spot. My husband ordered the steak sandwich with fries, and though the meat and cheese on the sandwich had amazing flavor, the hoagie roll it came on was extremely hard and inedible, we told the waiter and he apologized profusely and quickly fixed the sandwich and brought a new one out with bread that was perfect. I can totally see us coming here again! A must dine spot!",

It took a long time to get the order taken and then brought out.  The food was room temperature.  Drinks were never refilled or offered to be refilled.  Hard to finish a meal when you don't have a drink.  Had to ask to get silverware.  The crunchy french toast was so crunchy that it hurt to bite into it and there was no flavor.  The turkey sausage was cold and tough like it had been reheated over and over.   Apple pancakes were good and very generous serving size, but cold. Even the cinnamon butter didn't melt on them.  Biscuits with gravy and eggs were good, but again room temperature.  The tables next to us were also upset with the service and made several comments.  One customer had to wave both hands in the air to get the attention of the server.  I will not be back.",

I flew into town and my wife had been bragging about this place as she is working temporarily in the area for a few weeks.  I get off the plane starving get my bags etc and we head to the restaurant.  Knowing we are cutting it close we make up some time arriving exactly 30 minutes to closing.  Young lady come to the front and inform us they have  made the last call for the tonight.  Never heard a restaurant making a last, let alone 30 minutes before closing.  I was not a happy camper to say the least.   I went against my norm and the next day we were leaving for California before the traffic got bad.  The restaurant is in the plaza where she work, it was combiner so I said ok let just go.   I will say in short the food is great and our server was dynamic.  Love the atmosphere and vibe.  Give this place a try, but don't arrive late, still not sure what's that's all about but the food and service did make up for it a bit.",

    "text": "We went to Meridiem for lunch. My partner had been to happy hour several times and had good things to say. The building is really lovely--high ceilings and lots of glass with an industrial feel. There's a really pretty floor to ceiling wine rack and several areas of bar and outdoor seating.  Given its location, it is no surprise they get a business lunch crowd. I felt a bit underdressed in shorts and a t-shirt, though it is a casual restaurant. We split the crab artichoke dip and the powerfood salad with chicken. The dip was rich and creamy with a good portion of shredded crab meat on top. The naan was pillowy, warm, and paired well. I wouldn't have minded a crunchier option for dipping as well--either corn chips or crusty bread, but no complaints. I was less happy with our powerfood salad. I didn't feel like it had enough going on to stand alone as a meal and at $12 it should have. My partner got a side of chicken breast ($4), which rounded things out a bit for him.  While our server was friendly enough, they seemed short staffed (my partner said it was a problem one night at happy hour too). I think I saw two servers covering the lunch crowd. We were charged incorrectly for the salad--$7 instead of $4 for chicken and couldn't find our server. We flagged the other one down, but it took 15-20 minutes to correct the mistake.   I'm sure we'll go back for happy hour as the food was good, but it still feels like there are some kinks to work out.",

There are multiple options for seating including an outdoor patio, bar seating, high top tables and regular tables.   However, the food was average at best.  We started with the crispy chicken wings. About 12 glazed wings came out in a bowl. They were cut up as wingette, drumette and tip. I was confused about why the tips remained, personally these are difficult to eat since it is mostly comprised of cartilage, skin and a bone. I suppose there are wing tip aficionados out there. We asked for a to go box which doesn't latch close. They brought another one which also had the same faulty latch. They should invest in better take-out boxes, a simpler design would do.   Next we had ordered the lobster and carne asada bruschetta. These took 40 minutes to arrive after the wings. We saw a server carrying them past our table and when we told him it was our order, he said they were not ours and that they were sitting at another table and needed to go to the right customers. Well yes they were ours and he brought them back and we could tell that they were sitting somewhere else for awhile because they were completely cold. I felt disgusted, but he didn't offer to replace them.  Finally we had the bison burger. They split it for us which was nice. However, it was just a solid decent. The bacon shallot jam had an odd taste and didn't go well with the burger at all.   The service was friendly enough, but unfortunately I doubt that we will return.",

I chose this spot because it was easy to make reservations and I didn't want to wait in any line.   When we got here we noticed that this place is still pretty new since they didn't even get their sign board ok top of the store done yet.   Walking inside it feels modern and cozy at the same time. We each ordered a breakfast and a cup of coffee to go with the meal. They refilled our cup about three times and the food was actually pretty good!!   I ordered their traditional breakfast and it came with so much food. Got the sausage and it came with two round sausage patties, eggs that you can choose and I had chosen scrambled, potatoes and also your choice of bread which I had gotten wheat. Overall the breakfast was super filling and I enjoyed it the most.   Got to spend time with friends during the holidays is always eventful!",

    "text": "Atmosphere - 5 stars They have a great patio, cool bar, beautiful open space with huge sliding glass doors, modern, bright and relaxing vibe.   Food - 4 stars We had breakfast. Planning to come back for dinner one night. The breakfast nachos were a fun menu item and tasty! I had a skillet that came out wrong. They fixed it and got me the potatoes that were supposed to be in it. But it's always annoying to have an incomplete meal in front of you while everyone else is eating.   Service - 3 stars (and that's being nice) Customer service will make or break a place every time (in my opinion). Service is lacking here big-time! Some training would be useful. Even just a friendly welcome would go a long way. I am thinking the owner may have sat us, but even he wasn't that friendly. He seemed busy with other tasks he wanted to get back to. The bartender helped us since the server was wandering around with a solemn face - she was \"sort of working\", but most of the tables seemed to be lacking any real attention (and they were not busy). The bartender was friendly enough (but like I said, my order got messed up somewhere along the way). Just no real welcoming, friendly vibe here at all.  I'll be back for dinner and will write another review then....",

I was over charged on my bill last week (server was Lucas) and called twice to discuss this. Both times I was told  a manager would call me back.  Nothing.  I don't know if the manager isn't getting the messages or they simply don't care.  Terrible customer ser Also a few months ago I ordered the charcuterie board and the quality was like a pre-wrapped grocery store item.  Based on these experiences I will not return.",

We arrived and though our waiter checked on us immediately and took our orders and was very friendly, it took a DANG long time to get our food... like it makes no sense because there were not that many other people there :\\  At one point I looked back towards the kitchen from the patio to see wtf was going on that it was taking so long and he came and said he saw it being plated... pfff.. seriously, it was too long of a wait for a weekday lunch.  Of course at this point we're all really damn hungry so when it finally came out, we kinda just felt disappointed at seeing the plates.  Ahi tuna salad portion is ridiculously meager. Like 4 tiny slivers of ahi tuna and there was nothing \"chopped\" about the salad, it was just lettuce and big chunks of cucumber. Definitely disappointing.  I had the Avocado chicken. THe breast was on the very dry side and it wasn't even warm or moist... the bacon on top of it was dry and room temp. Not sure what happened to my dish.. maybe it sat alllll that time forgotten.  Big flop.  My friend's BLT had soggy bread (yuk) and her \"hashtag\" fries were stale... again, flop.  This was our first time here and I was really looking forward to trying it out but it really missed the spot on food timing and food in general.. there are so many better options in Chandler than this and basically I have zero interest in returning.  Sorry, I tried.",

Friend and I decided to split two different meals (crepes and chipotle bowl) crepes came out (supposed to be 3 or them, got 2) and they were as hard as chips and very thick (sense). The over easy eggs were running but so were the clear egg whites. I understand the yolk but the egg white? Nah. Will not be going back.  They did cut my check in half which was a plus so props to that. Typically when they cut a check price in half it's because something with the meal was actually wrong so there's that.  Also the music did not fit the vibe.",

It was very modern yet had a good relaxed feeling to it. The staff was super friendly and responsive which was nice. The food was very good!

    "text": "Not a great place, not a bad place, kind of a medium 5 at best.  The staff was friendly enough, you can tell they are still getting their bearings or are in training, they meant well though and that is appreciated.  The food itself feels like they are...skimping. The entrees are very small, if you order a steak or a meat dish, your meat will be a little baby bite, but the potatoes and carb sides are piled on high, to the point you'll ask yourself...\"Did I order a steak with a side of potatoes or did my potato dish come with steak on the side?\"  I don't like when restaurants cheap out and give you too much filler, it says the kitchen isn't creative enough in building a complete dish that satisfies, it's also a bit tacky, it's also a rip off considering the prices here are not exactly super cheap. Brunch for 2 people will be at least 40-50 bucks, and for what you get, it isn't really worth it. I left asking myself what did I just spend 45 bucks on?  Suggestions: Stop piling on the filler and make your entrees heartier and more worth their value. Nobody needs 2 pounds of tater tots with a breakfast steak, even things out please.   It's a nice enough space, it has nice style, it's just not memorable or really worth a return visit anytime soon, maybe once in a blue moon if some friends or visitors want to stop in. Average at best, kind of dissapointing. Cheers anyways!",

The hostess was super friendly, but as my boyfriend and I waited on the patio we were waiting at least 15 minutes before I had to get up and flag someone down. It was a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't very busy. After we had our order taken down I had to flag down another person for the toast that came with my meal. For the third time, I flagged yet another person over to get our bill. We interacted with at least 4 different staff members which was pretty annoying considering half the time we asked for things we had already ordered and nobody checked in to see how our food was/if we needed anything else. We had a gift card and that's why we decided to give this place a try, otherwise we wouldn't have stopped to see what it was about. I wouldn't go back based on how bad the service was especially when the food was far from impressive.",

It was overpowering the meat! I think it's a little loud in there and maybe some of those acoustic boards on the celling could help. It wasn't horrible though. I could still hear my husband and another gentleman we were talking to at the bar. Drinks were pretty reasonably priced and the Tito's and soda with lime (The T Rex) was not over or under poured. It was well worth the $5 and came in a tall glass. Whether they poached the Living Room and La Sala servers or not really has nothing to do with anything. I work nearby in the same business park and I'm happy to have a new nice place in the Ocotillo area that isn't part of the \"room\" monopoly!",

Great job, well done, can't wait to be back!!!",

Restaurant very noisy with little sound absorption. All three sandwiches very good and more than adequate in size. Nicole provided us with a good preview of breakfast menu as well as lunch. Service was good and check prepared early at my request. Definitely want to go try breakfast. Love the jelly beans at the hostess desk.",

    "text": "My husband and I are foodies and love dining out several times per week. He works near Meridiem and told me about the opening. When we were looking for a nearby breakfast spot, Yelp here said it was #3 so we figured we'd give it a try. The decor, as many have mentioned, is nice. It's young & trendy and feels like a classy place. There was a dj playing music that, honestly, didn't bother me but really would be more fitting for the evening. We placed our order and got some coffee. Then we waited. And waited. A half hour later, the server finally said she was going back to check on the food after apologizing twice for the wait. I ordered a Benedict of sorts with bacon, avacado, and tomato. Potatoes had to be ordered separately. My husband ordered a skillet with eggs on top. I ate one side of the bene and noticed the eggs were very undercooked and underseasoned. I mentioned this to her and they did comp my order and the coffees since we waited and I could only eat half my meal. If it wasn't $16 for breakfast, I might not have been as disappointed, but I felt like I had higher expectations, considering the prices. Again, the service was good and we appreciate when something goes wrong and they take responsibility and try to make it right. Because of this, I'd consider going back for drinks and apps in the evening. The patio looks nice. I just wouldn't return for food again unless I heard the kitchen had gotten much better. I wish them luck but it's not looking promising at this point.",

The last lunch, a couple of weeks back, was so so - not good but not awful.  Yesterday I brought in 3 friends for lunch and it was absolutely horrible. I only ordered a caesar salad with medium cooked steak. First off - tomatoes do not belong on a caesar salad -- ever.  The lettuce was limp, there was hardly enough dressing and the steak was inedible (burnt and funny taste to it).  After 3 bites I was done. The server asked if she could box it, I told her trash it!  AND I was charged $21. Not one person at the table had anything good to say about their meal. The only thing good about this place is it is a nice place/atmosphere and our server Mama V was really good. We were told that the entire staff and menu had recently changed -- and it shows.  Spend your money somewhere else!",

My kids told him it was my birthday, he could have cared less. Took a while for our drinks mine didn't come, then a young lady came with 2 of the drinks that we already received and and mine but mine was wrong. Took close to an hour for our food to arrive, then waited quite a while for the bill. I'll give them another chance because the food was so good and the restaurant is so pretty. My only complaint was the service, that is such an important part of the dinning experience. Otherwise I would definitely give them 5 stars.",

Sometimes it's a little quieter on the patio, but that can be hot depending on the weather.

    "text": "We really wanted to like this restaurant. The atmosphere is great-very open, floor to ceiling windows, very laid back & airy. Our food on the other hand was very, very, heavy- flavors all very good, but too much for our taste.  I ordered  the soup of the day, tortilla soup. When it arrived I thought I'd been given a dish of sweet potatoes. No spoon was needed, nor was I given one.  It tasted good, it just wasn't soup.  The two other dish I ordered was the same way, 3 meatballs-had to find the meatballs because swimming in marina and cheese-thought I'd mistakingly ordred lasagna. My daughter's grill cheese sandwich was as described,  except there was a long black hair in her side-salad. Despite the atmosphere, it was a no-win at the Meridiem. It is a cool place. The style of food wasn't for us. I will probably go back for drinks & the atmosphete.",

They have pretty good and varying drinks and a good brunch menu.  It's also got a really cool ambience.  Servers have always been great.  One thing for kids is they run out high chairs almost every time we come. They have booster seats which suffice. Highly recommend.",

The breakfast crowd is seated in the bar area which has a mix of high tops and tables in a modern slightly industrial design. It was comfortable. There are some tables that are too close to the kitchen door and bathroom, and if your at any table facing that way you see the doors.I was disappointed by that design considering this is a new build.I did not seem well thought out. Lunch and dinner may be served in the larger adjacent dining room. I already have an upcoming dinner there and I look forward to trying that menu. It's a little hard to spit from main road, no flashy signage. Turn off price toward Drury hotel and you enter restaurant from the rear.",

Both times our food came out at different times (the last time my meal came out way after he had already finished his meal...and it wasn't even what I ordered). Our waitress had way too many tables, but she was pleasant and apologetic. I worked in the restaurant business for many years and they should really look at how they seat people. No waitress should be given more tables than they can handle and no kitchen should be given more tickets than they can cook. If that means that you go on a wait...so be it. Then at least patrons can decide if they want to stay that long, instead of being seated with the impression that they are going to enjoy a regularly timed meal. This restaurant seems really \"green\" to me, but it has potential. I've actually enjoyed everything I have eaten there...the kinks and logistics just need to be worked out.   I will say, the last time the manager did give us free breakfast vouchers so we will be back to try it a third time  and probably our last if they don't get it right this time (however, the fact that you have pre-made free breakfast vouchers is never a good sign).",

There are two patios, one on the east side to you can stay out of the sun and one on the south side if you want to be in the sun.  We had the bacon wrap shrimp, they were delish.  And we shared the BLT, a simple sandwich but surprising many places can not do a good one. This was large with lots of bacon, so big that as we shared, we were both full.  That came with french fries, crisp and tender, delish. Just one tip to the management, eco friendly take out containers.",

However, the echoes were loud which made hearing conversation at the table difficult.   Bazaar begging - arrived at restaurant and was told it would be a 10-15 minute wait. After walking past the hostess table we discover about four to five open table were available during the time we were asked to wait. Our party of 3 was asked to sit at the end of a high top table that was actually for a party 8. We were confused on why we're asked to wait with so many open tables available and at such a large table?",

Good quality ingredients but not a huge wow factor.   The cocktails were extremely over priced.  I ordered a $12 old fashioned that was nowhere near a True old fashioned.  Drowned in ice with a slice of Orange and no sweet at all.  Wife's cocktails were fair at best and most are $11-12.   So great to have live music too, problem is the volume is at 11.  Can't hear the person next to you, we were screaming the whole night.   There is a separate room that is quieter so we may try that next time.",
