    "text": "In my last few weeks in Phoenix I tried to line up as many restaurants to try as possible, especially hoping to find some worthy Mexican food. I enjoyed my lunch at the Comedor and would gladly return.  The spot is huge; a re-purposed event ballroom I'm told. A group of four of us went one Sunday for lunch and though the space was pretty full of families, we were seated within 5 minutes.   For lunch I ordered shrimp enchiladas which came four to a plate (corn tortillas) with rice and refried beans. Tasted great, the shrimp were cooked well, not rubbery, and the chile sauce was lightly spicy. One friend ordered the chicken mole, and I had a few bites and would highly recommend it. Admittedly the mole was not spicy enough for either of our tastes, but it was rich and complex, and the chicken was spectacular: so moist and tender, just swimming in the thick sauce. mmmmmmm!   Reasonably priced, generous with seating, quick service and solid Mexican fare.",

We show up an hour before the party to get the food and the price is $429!!!  What?!!  \"Sorry ma'am do you want it or not?\"  We were told we \"must have been misquoted by Maria who took the order.\"  We had NO choice but to take it since guests were arriving in less than an hour. I called back SEVERAL times to rectify this mistake and was either told someone would call me back (it NEVER happened) or they would hang up on me! Yes hang up. I was told that's what we do when we get busy. We just hang up the phone because we can't answer it. Really?!!  I finally reached Terry, and she wanted to get off the phone quickly but I refused to let her hang up until it was resolved and the end result was \"Sorry...we don't do refunds here....you should have known what the price was.\"  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  MARIA TOLD me what the price was and it almost DOUBLED upon pick up. By the way when Terry decided she had enough of the phone conversation she just hung up. THIS PLACE IS A JOKE!!!!!  Unreal!  LEARN CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE!!",

    "text": "Does \"authentic\" mean \"good\"?  Not necessarily.   I suppose the Comedor is more authentic than a place like Macayo's or Garcia's because they offer such typically Mexican delicacies as tripa and cabeza. They also have a menu full of the fish and mariscos that anglos tend not to order in typical Gringo-Mex outlets. They also don't drown their entrees under an avalanche of yellow cheddar cheese.  But as an experience I would say even if it does offer a greater selection of authentic menu items, it's not really that much more satisfying than the other places.   I had the carne asada tacos, which were serviceable if not thrilling. The dish came out warm and didn't have the tell-tale signs of having sat under the salamander for longer than it should. At one time these tacos would have been a revelation to anyone weaned on the Lawry's hard-shell ones. Now, with their soft, grilled dual corn tortilla goodness wrapping them, they resemble any number of other \"street tacos\" that have become more and more popular recently.  The atmosphere is . . . well. . . \"comedor\" means \"dining room\" in Spanish. That's what it is: A big room full of tables. Mariachis were a nice touch.  We waited 30 minutes at lunchtime on a Saturday to get a table. Maybe that's why I am less than thrilled.  The place doesn't want for popularity. Aside from the wait, I had no complaints with the service.  So to the uninitiated, I would go with an open mind, not expecting a life-changing experience. I would also advise people to try the things like the lengua molcajete (a sort of tongue stew served in a lava bowl). The availability of stuff like that is what really sets Comedor apart.  And keep in mind that \"authentic\" doesn't always mean \"good\".",

When so many others stopped offering free chips and salsa while you wait I was SHOCKED by not only getting chips and salsa but a cup of soup while waiting for our meal. We went in for lunch, and while we had to wait 10-15 minutes for our table, the service was awesome and we were in and out quickly. They do not mess around here and I was thoroughly impressed. The food was close to the Tex Mex that I crave from home and the value for the money is solid. The chili rellanos was killer. Will be back regularly!",

We were served soup with our chips and salsa, but I am not a soup fan so I passed on that one. The chips were ok, I have definitely had worse.

Please be aware there is almost always a long wait (30 minutes plus) but it is well with the wait.   Also great place to take out-of-towners.",

    "text": "Our son was recommended to this restaurant by a lady who does her own catering and says that this is her favorite.  We are always up for Mexican food especially the Mom and Pop places.  The lady was  spot on with her recommendation.  This was a Saturday afternoon at about 1.30 PM. and we still has a small wait for about 15 min.  What first struck me was the tables are far apart from each other.  Usually you get a cramped feeling and frankly it  gets noisy. Not in this case.  I love the fact there were not many Gringos . So the restaurants screams authenticity.  I'm a wimp and usually one that orders the Green Enchiladas with Green Sauce, Rice and always no beans.  This was by far the very best ones I have ingested from Tucson to Phoenix.  The sauce also has mild green peppers so the combination of the chicken, the sauce and the additional peppers makes this stand out.  Hubby had the Chili Rellano with a ground beef and potato taco.  Loved it as well.  The prices are fair on most of the combos.   But there are some really different items in the Seafood like Capechana, Cervice de Camaron, Steak Picano, Carnitas de Puerto which is deep fried chunks of pork loin, Chimichangas, Burritos.  I saw several people order dishes with Mole Sauce (Chocolate) but couldn't find it on the menu.  The service was good as well.    Place is conveniently located just off the freeway on Central.  I'm from Tucson so I don't get to Phoenix to often but this will sure be a stop we will make.",

The food was what you would get at any restaurant from here to Oregon... nothing special. It was OK. When our bill came everything was more than it said on the menu. Just ordinary Mexican food with no substitutions, nothing innovative, not much thought to the sauces, no vegetables. Nice server, but overpriced and under wowed, by far. I'm a lightweight drinker and had a margarita, which was 10., on an empty stomach and didn't feel a thing. Lots of terrific, innovative food in this town so won't go here again.",

I had the very simple taco, tostada, rice & beans. Very good. Refrito frijoles were creamy with shredded cheese, rice was (almost) perfectly cooked. Taco and the tostado were correct. I ordered a draft and got a huge mug with a lime. This is a good Mexican Food restaurant!",

Everything seems fine as a costumer but back in the kitchen and after hours it's a completely different picture. The owner has got to be the rudest human I've ever came across. I was sitting with my friend waiting for breakfast when I hear a young man (employee) asking the owner if he can go home early since he had just came back from surgery. This woman yelled at him telling him that he must stay or he would lose his job. I couldn't believe what I was hearing this poor guys face look blue and his voice was shaking my heart was breaking for him. For a moment I thought I was on the show what would you do since this situation was just so inhuman. The worse part was when I went to the restroom I saw another co worker found the young man on the floor crying with pain. I suggested he reported his horrible woman but he had his reasons as to why he was afraid to do so. In the end we left in disgust and angry at what we had witnessed. Later I mentioned this experience to others and some stated they had relatives or friends that have worked there in the past and let me tell you if I thought my story was bad their experiences blew my mind. I will never go back and give this women a cent of my hard earned money. I hope more people start speaking up about this place and not be afraid of getting laid off. I hope this helps some of you when choosing your next new restaurant.",

It's an interesting vintage space, no windows, kind of like a cavernous bunker from 1974. The food tastes fresh but rather bland. The green chicken enchiladas were okay, the chilaquiles (they only have red) were like corn chips smothered in bland canned enchilada sauce with eggs, and the machaca was mediocre. I feel there are countless better places in Phoenix to have Mexican food. The service has always been friendly. There's often a wait for tables with a line out the door. The prices are rather high. Overall, along the lines of Macayos and Garcias.",

The sauce would make an old shoe taste great! Its complexity makes your mind race trying to figure out what's in it. This time, I tasted warmth - cinnamon...possibly cloves or nutmeg. Not much - just a hint of it. But the warmth was but a kiss of mystery. The flour tortilla was served nice and hot. It was of the fresh and dry variety - not the spongy waxy variety. The rice is simple - allowing the rest of the meal to shine and not be overpowered by over seasoned sides   My husband had the enchiladas de camarones. Again, the sauce was expertly crafted and had the richness of a fine fine French sauce.   We started the meal with the coctel de camaron. Like everything else - expertly prepared with the freshest ingredients.",

I'd put it in the same category as Garcia's, Macayo's, On the Border, or Cantina Laredo.  That is, it's Mexican-American food - saucey, cheesy, and spicy with a flour tortilla and a margarita on top.  It's just the type of food most gringos think of when we think of Mexican food.  On the other hand, if you're a Defeno you'll probably roll your eyes at this food and hope that we gringos don't really think ALL Mexican food is this stereotypical.  For a beverage, try the Jamaica - it's mellow and fruity just like the Defenos like it.  Then for dessert, try the Plantains with Vanilla Ice Cream - it's syrupy-sweet just like the gringos like it.",

    "text": "I (finally) tried Comedor Guadalajara with a friend in from out of town last weekend. I was surprised by how busy they were on a Sunday at lunch time- there were people crowded in front of the restaurant and they announced names over an intercom. Whoa. We were seated fairly quickly in the (extremely large) dining room and service was efficient from that point on. The chips and salsa were more like chips and hot sauce, but they tasted good... I love the spiciness of the sauce and put it on everything. When it came to ordering, we were a little disappointed. My friend is a vegetarian and thought Mexican food would be no problem, but our waitress didn't know of almost anything on the menu that was vegetarian (most items have lard). He ended up getting cheese enchiladas and thought they were pretty 'meh.' Here's the real kicker though, I got the chicken burrito, which was absolutely delicious.... the chicken was juicy and cooked well... but the burrito mainly consisted of fantastic and flavorful grilled veggies...the type that would be perfect for a vegetarian perhaps.... hmmm. Anyway, other than that mishap, I really enjoyed my burrito and would go back to get it again.   PS prices were reasonable, especially at lunch, and the portions were large.",

The salsa is like pure fire and not for the weak. Be careful on Friday and Saturday nights, as it tends to have a long wait at popular times between 5 and 8 p.m. Service is always great and portions are massive. You won't be disappointed here.",

    "text": "Dear Comedor Guadalajara,  I love you. I miss you. I wish the lightrail went to your doorstep so I could visit you more often!! This is my vote for best Mexican food in the city. Just north of the Salt River on Central Avenue, in what looks like a failing industrial part of the city just seconds south of Downtown Phoenix is this amazing, beautiful gem of a mexican restaurant.   With a large parking lot that is oftentimes full to the max, it can be a bit of a wait during peak eating hours. My best advice is to come during the off hours. I like 2PM on a saturday best. Everyone is bright and happy and the drinks are flowing (yes at 2PM, don't judge me!) and the salsa is SCORCHING hot! and the chips are yummy and the Beans N Chorizo Dip is incredible! If the salsa is too hot, ask for the mild and/or sour cream. The mild has no heat at all but is still flavorful and you can add as much of the hotter sauce to match your taste. It's delish. I like to order the plate that comes with green chilie relleno and a beef taco w/rice & Beans. My fave!   This is a good place for large parties, as most tables can accommodate 6 people. and some tables in the back can host even more than that. I've totally seen like 3 birthday parties going on at the same time back there! it was awesome! I scored some free cake! LOL!   The service is top notch with a super nice general manager who always manages to come by and say hi. I'm starting to think she recognizes me. I've seriously taken all of my friends to this place since rediscovering it two years ago.   To my yelpers, I say:  GO! Go now! Get that salsa and enjoy yourself! This place is awesome!",

I have no idea what they put in there, but it tasted so good that I cleaned my plate (and I am a light-eater so I usually NEVER clean my plate and I usually don't even eat the side rice and beans).  I will definitely be back again. the only downsides to this place that I've seen so far are: long wait if you go at lunch rush, not located in a great neighborhood, chips and salsa are meh (would've given 5 stars if the salsa was better), and it closes at 8 PM.",

Everyone seemed to be having a good time and there were families as well as people dating or friends just having dinner together.  The quality of the food was very high.  I wouldn't say it was innovative but it was yummy.  Additionally all the waiters and staff at the restaurant were genuine and friendly.

The chile relleno is not good. The poblanos are not roasted. It seems like they just stuff the raw chili with cheese and fry in the batter. You cant even cut it with your fork cause its so tough. The red sauce on the chile relleno tastes like they pour it right out of a can. It has no authentic taste to it at all. The cheese used on the cheese crisp is not good either. Its a mixed cheese and always comes out burned and too crispy. I do love the Micheladas at this place which is why we usually come anyway. This place is ALWAYS packed and you ALWAYS have to wait at least 15-20 mins.",

It does help if you speak spanish as this is authentic Mexican spot. They do, however, have some American food on the kids menu. Haha. My kid....  We have had a lot of big brunches here for birthday's and such and they have a room in the back to accommodate. Sometimes they have a live Trio walking around singing classics.

First off, they have the BEST green sauce I have ever had.  Seriously. So good.  Went here for dinner one evening, and we had to wait about 5 minutes, no biggie, the place was busy.  We were seated and our waiter brought over the most delicious chips and salsa.  I have a soft spot in my heart for salty homemade chips, and they definitely delivered.  The salsa was a bit too spicy for my taste, but the smidgen that I had of it was quite tasty. The hubs was practically drinking it out of the bowl even though it was a hair spicy for him as well.  I ordered the enchilada with beef and green sauce.  Came with the usual rice and beans.  Hubs got the same I think.  I'll say it again, best green sauce ever.  I devoured as much as I possibly could, but I do not have a second stomach, so the other half of it was coming home with me.  We've come back several times since, and each time is as good if not seemingly better than the last!",

    "text": "Went to Comedor Guadalajara for a friend's birthday on a Friday night.  I saw they had Happy Hour deals so i went there a little early to have a drink in their bar or cantina except for they don't have one.  Bummer.  We had 7 people in our party and they don't take reservations so I put our name in ahead of time and just sat in the waiting area.  Another member of our party arrived too with the same thought I had to have a drink in the bar while waiting for the others to arrive.  The owner or manager was in the front at the hostess table and he was nice enough to let us go ahead and get seated while we waited for the rest of our party.  This was smart because my friend and I and ultimately a 3rd guest arrived and we had washed down 5 beers until the rest arrived.  You don't make money with people waiting to be seated.  We started off with appetizers of a couple of orders of cheese crisps and a side of guacamole.  wow were these good.  I totally recommend these to anybody for starters.  For dinner I ordered the Carne Asada Tampequena.  It was Carne Asada, a cheese enchilada, rice, beans, tortillas and a side garnish of lettuce, tomatoes and guacamole.  Great meal at a great price.  i could barely finish it.  I love horchata and noticed they had it on the menu so I ordered a glass of it and it came in HUGE cup served over ice.  Tastiest horchata I've had in a long time.  For dessert I heard the Churros & Ice Cream was to die for so I tried it.  Holy hell is that good and a great idea.  if I can't have my fried ice cream, this definately ranks right up there.  The churros were hot and crispy and along with the vanilla flavored ice cream I wanted with it, I will be definitely getting that again!  I would give CG 5 stars but I have to take a star off for location.  It is in a dicey part of town but there were security guards watching the parking lot and parking when I left the restaurant at around 8 was a zoo so if you come in during prime dinner time you might have a hard time finding a spot.  While CG is very good unless I'm going to downtown for something, I probably wouldn't go back just for dinner and find something closer to me and in a better location.",

The service is good and some chips and salsa were served up right away. The salsa was super hot even for me so couldn't eat much of it. The lunch came out and the server warned about the hot plate. The salsa was hot the rest of the meal with rice and beans was bland. I was hoping the soup might change my mind but not, it reminded me of Cambells beef and vegetable soup. Nothing inspiring here so I doubt I will go back.",

The rice and beans were excellent and the chips served were hot and tasty. The taco and enchilada were just ok nothing exceptional or beyond the regular drive through taco shop. The meat in my daughters chimichanga was very burnt to the point most of it could not be eaten and the service was just alright as well. The manager offered no resolution for the burnt food. Given the quality of the food this place is way overpriced. We likely won't return as it just didn't live up to the hype! Lastly, the waitress lost my debit card ! Very unsatisfied",

When someone asks me if I know a good Mexican restaurant, this will be my recommendation.   It has the standard quirks that Mexican restaurants usually comes with. What quirks you may ask? You know.. the quirks. Very roomy too, check out other customers pictures. They start you off with a tasty soup, that I only can imagine that is free. The prices can look like they are a bit on the high end for a place  like this (relative, they are not expensive), but then again when you have this rate of return customers, you can charge that little extra.. and you as a customer get it back in quality, and quantity. I didn't finish my full plate.  The chicken chimi. A massive chimi. One! The size of 3 normal chimis. More than enough rice, more than enough beans covered with cheese. Yes, this seriously was not in my diet.. but I was hungry, and I got stuffed. I would definitely have this again.   The waitresses is good and patient. No mistakes, and took our silly questions with a smile. No, I think I have found my go-to Mexican place for now. They deserve their reputation.. and they have been there forever, which means like 40 years or something.",

We waited for 40 minutes for a table and when we were taken to it there were 5 tables in the same section that were empty and stayed empty for the 2 hours we were there. When we left, there were still about 25 people waiting to be seated. WHY???   I ordered the chicken salad and it couldn't have been more disappointing.  The chicken had a fish taste, the 20 cucumber slices were dry and old looking and the 2 lime slices were so old they were turning brown; the lettuce was the same lettuce they use for garnish on every other dish.  The tomatoes' were almost a puree. Yep that's all that was on this salad from a Mexican restaurant....No pinto beans, no cheese, no guacamole...NOTHING!  Only 1 person at our table ate all of their food and only 1 person asked for a to go box.  We were all very excited to try this place because we've heard so many good things about it.  We've taken this place off of our celebration lunch list.  The staff were all very friendly and the place was clean.  Best part of our experience.",

    "text": "Certainly, there are two main things that stand out about this establishment, one is the authentic food and the other is the wide variety to choose from. The menu is loaded with options, and nicely arranged so that it's easy to navigate and find exactly what taste buds look forward to, from traditional favorites like tacos and enchiladas, to albondigas, parrillas, and Marsico's. Of course, there are different ways to measure authentic, quality food. Does the food taste as good as Nana's? Yes, and it looks good too. One menu item that is unique and hard to find in any other Mexican restaurant in the area, is Flan, a custard dessert with a layer of clear caramel. Churros are also a family favorite. The food is authentic, great tasting, and high-quality. In addition to the amazing food and desserts, they also serve refreshing traditional drinks, such as Agua Frescas and Orchata. For adults, tasty Margarita's, Micheladas, imported beers, and a variety of wines. All in all, there is something for everyone. In an Expertise website article, Best Caterers in Phoenix 2019, Comedor Guadalajara was recognized for their authentic food and catering options serving various events (Expertise).  In addition to the excellent food, the service is friendly and efficient. From the parking lot, where attendants watch over the area, to the hostess' that are ready to assist with seating, and ultimately, the waiters responsive and at your service. Patrons will find that employees in each section of the restaurant work as a team, there is never a visible delay. Of course, there are peak days and hours when there might be a short wait to be seated, mostly during the week for lunch and all day on the weekends. The inside waiting area is cool and comfortable, and the outside waiting area is covered, it has misters that are used in the summer months. When dining in is not an option, takeout orders are also available.  Furthermore, the prices are reasonable, and plates are filled. Comedor Guadalajara also offers a variety of discounts, with daily lunch specials, happy hour favorites, and weekend specials on beverages and selected food items. For an individual serving of any meal, the lowest price on the menu is $5.95 and can go as high as $18.95 if dipping in to the \"Marisco's\" seafood.           In conclusion, Comedor Guadalajara stands out above the rest, it serves authentic Mexican dishes with a wide variety of menu options, the service is friendly and efficient, and the prices are very reasonable. Comedor Guadalajara is a True favorite in the community and surrounding areas. The location is also ideal for those in the downtown area looking for authentic quality food during a lunch hour, or dinner for two, or the entire family, after a movie or sporting event. Come in and see for yourself!",

Think again! The restaurant is trying to minimize food waste which is a note-worthy in my book.   Overall, the service is friendly, prompt and respectful.

    "text": "I'll start by saying, \"Don't be mislead by the name 'Guadalajara.'\" This comedor immortalizes an archetypic, soon-to-be-anachronistic (I fear) cuisine: AzMex Sonoran! Yes, the menu is extensive (!), but, more importantly, it IS the food that we grew up with here in AZ - since at least the 1950's. From the AZ cumin-laced hot sauce & chips through the entire menu, it's really REAL. And there are other culinary innovations as well. The service is always faultless. As we do on the first THU of each month, a few of us meet for breakfast here - and a few cervezitas. One friend always orders Huevos Rancheros over easy w/ Refried Pinto (of course) Beans & Coronas. This huge plate is a masterpiece, with perfectly accomplished, runny yolks. My \"always-go-to\" dish at Vietnamese restaurants is Ph Bo. At Mexican ones, it's Beef Green Chile. CG's version of Green Chile uses traditional beef (sorry, NM pork lovers) and it's absolutely, perfectly executed, w/ tender beef chunks and bits of chile & onion in a meaty brown gravy. I save some of the accompanying refried beans with the \"correct\" cheese blanket for for the best desert dessert ever. The corn & flour tortillas need no improvement. Ah, shades of my childhood in Tucson and Northern Sonora! A first-time GC taster from Massachusetts asked if something was wrong w/ my breakfast & I had to explain that I was shaking my head in disbelief in how incredible it all was! I haven't tried the nopales or other delicacies yet, since it's difficult to quit my Green Chile addiction! Wanna' know what models of AzMex to use as ideal to compare with others? Come here to Comedor Guadalajara to do research!",

We had to walk pretty far to get to our table but it gave us a chance to see ALL of the restaurant.  When we finally made it to our table my husband and I ordered adult drinks  asked for ID.! I absolutely LOVED it and gladly showed mine unfortunately my gray haired husband had left his in the car and has pain in his hips when he walks so he was definitely not going back to the car to get it and the waitress in no way was going to serve him without seeing some type of ID so please have it ready.. The food and drinks  were Amazing and we will definitely be back..",

    "text": "I was here for the second meet up of the International Supper Club UYE. I thought that the first meet up was going to be hard to beat because it was so good but this place knocked another one out of the park. I think I just found my new favorite Mexican food place in town. From the outside it looks like a hodge podge of different additions obviously added at different times with no thought at trying to make it match at all. Even the parking lot was a little crazy. Walking in the two front doors continues the hodge podge theme. This is a family owned restaurant that has been here awhile for sure. We sat in the front waiting area for the rest of the group to show up and I had to use the bathroom really quick. Those were also scary. Questions started to arise about this place. I hope the food is good. We waited a little while longer and they decided to seat us even though our whole party wasn't there. Then we walk in to the main dinning are. Now obviously at some point they gutted the entire inside and completely remodeled it. It was very nice. It was a large open space with an exposed ceiling and lots of tables. We were taken to a back section where several tables had been pushed together for us. Maria our server came over and chips and salsa were on the table immediately. She did a great job the entire night. Best services I have had in awhile. She took everyone's drink orders and drinks started to come out a few at a time. Once everyone was there and ready to order she went around the table and took everyone's order. Offering suggestions and helping with custom orders. After what seemed like only a few minutes. Dishes started to come out as well. One or two here then a few more over there. Finally everybody had what they ordered and it all looked and smelled really good. Then fork went to mouth and somewhere a chorus started singing. Wow this was really good. I had ordered a Carne Asada steak with a cheese enchilada. I couldn't pronounce what it was called when I ordered it and I won't even attempt it here. It really was some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. The steak had a great flavor to it and with all of the cheese and sauce and everything it just added to it. I couldn't even finish. Although there wasn't too much left. Even after that I still had to try some dessert especially after I saw churros and ice cream on the menu. This was not a mistake. It was so good. The ice cream was fantastic and the churros were warm and soft. Everything was amazing. Maria was a great server. The company was fantastic as usual. Maria even split the check up for us even though there was a handwritten sign up front that said they didn't do that. I hope to have many return visits here. My new favorite Mexican place hands down.",

Well, don't let looks deceive you. This place is great!  I've had Chilaquiles y Huevos, Machaca Con Huevos, Steak and Chicken Picado and some tacos. Everything has been delicious.

We were in a cave like room waiting for our table, luckily it was just a 5 minute wait for lunch.  One inside the main dining hall we were able to see the large size of this place, tables finished wall decorates but a unfinished ceilings and no windows make up the inside.  I oped for the chillies relleno off the lunch special menu $7.50  most of the lunch specials range from 7.25 to 8.50.  From seating to our main course we had over 5 different people visit our table.  The chips were nothing special bu I do like the the spicy and thin salsa here.  My chillie rellno was a bit different, the sauce was a bland tomato based sauce, the chillie it self could have used a bit more roasting and the cheese seemed a bit thin.  Overall the prices seemed high for the location, and quality of food, I would sooner go to la canasa.",

As an appetizer, we tried the Frijoles con Chorizo dip. One of the best I have had :) I also had Camarones y Pulpo a la Diabla  (Shrimp & Octopus in hot chipotle sauce) . All I can say is I will definitely come back to try more of their dishes. It was absolutely phenomenal!! I also saw another table with Micheladas, so I will check those out as well.",

The venu itself is large, dark, uninspiring, and devoid of any character. This can also describe the food. Salsa was actually good, but the chips tasted like they were fried in old grease. Beef enchiladas had no seasoning, the tortilla itself was not cooked over very high heat as it was very soggy and mushy in texture. Typical spanish rice and refried beans. My goal is to find GREAT food, not average to below average, somewhere in that range is where this spot lies. So again not worth your time, energy, or money to visit this spot.",

    "text": "Friends wanted to eat here before a dbacks game...nwent inside the restaurant and it was poppin in the waiting room... It was a 45 minute wait for a table for four... Friend reassured us that it was worth it so we decided to wait...  It was kinda cool waiting for a table because of how many people were going in and out of the restaurant and they seem to have a system all set up.. There were parties of 2, 4, 7 12 and even 14... There were a few parties that was more than 10 people.... Definitely a family friendly place!  Looked at the menu and the prices were reasonable... About 8-15 dollars a plate depending on what you order Service was fast and friendly!  We got the our drinks and chips and salsa (free) real quickly! The salsa was pretty spicy for me but still good!  I ordered taquitos de carne asada.. It was delicious I posted a pic.. The rice and beans were so good.. The rice has a little bit of crispyness to it.. And the meat was juicy...pico de gallo was also fresh and delicious!  Only down side is how greasy the tacos were but what Mexican food isn't greasy right?   I can't wait to come back and try more and maybe take a huge party with me too!  Love the family atmostphere :)",

Our party of nine was super satisfied and can't wait to visit again when we are in the area. Too bad they were closed on Easter otherwise we would've ordered to-go for the ride home.",

    "text": "(Lyrics - The Outfield - Your Love)  Mexican food in Phoenix is far away Come sometimes and try it over So many things that I want to eat You know I like my tacos little bit spicy Let's go to Comedor Guadalajara tonight! Let's go to Comedor Guadalajara tonight!  Comedor Guadalajara is one of those sketchy looking places that borderlines danger and well maybe a little adventure wouldn't hurt!  Needless to say, from the outside the location of this place is pretty off beat (Ghetto!) in my books.  The inside is totally different.  Family friendly and staff is pretty up beat and on the ball.  I came here with my family and we ordered a bunch for Happy Hour!  I went for the sampler appetizer platter and the Mole Chicken Enchiladas with a Modelo beer.  The appetizer came with mini shredded beef tacos on a crispy shell, frijoles, mini cheese crisp, and guacamole.  Overall, a nice start, the platter was perfect for sharing for 2 and a great combination with a beer.  The Mole chicken was steaming hot and came with refried beans and rice.  It was thick and creamy with a minor hint of cocoa which was perfect!    Overall, service was top notch.  The food was very good for Phoenix Mexican cuisine.  I can't say it's the best in town cause it's a give or take thing.  In the end, what makes Mexican food for me is the sauce and salsa.  Comedor Guadalajara delivers on the food part, but the sauces really makes the difference on my palates! - Enjoy!",

Tucson has it at every corner, but unfortunately Phoenix is known for having Tex-Mex. After flying with a crew member who said his friend recommended this place I was a little weary. However, after pulling up and seeing a line of about a 100 people, with some of them carrying out Moving Boxes FULL of take out, I was reassured that this had to be good!   They told us seating would take about 40 minutes, but it only took 20. This place is deceiving. It is much larger than it looks from the outside. Service was fast, and the smell makes your mouth water!  I order the machaca chimichanga, which was soooooo good!!! And a margarita which did not taste as strong as it was. Hats off to the bartender. Overall we were so happy with our orders, but I have to say my chimichanga was the tastiest meal at our table. So if you are thinking about ordering it, you will not be disappointed :) .",

    "text": "Ci!  Comedor Guadalajara is a place that seems to always come up when discussing Phoenix Mexican food.  I finally found myself in the area and dropped by for early lunch and was not disappointed.  To the tourists and over cautious it may not look like the best area to be but have no worries.  This part of town is just old and run down.  You won't be knifed in the parking lot and there's even a security guard keeping an eye on the lot.  Have no fears.  As per usual when I hit a Mexican place I ordered the enchilada's.  The appetizer was the standard free house chips and salsa.  Oh, boy!  The salsa!  I always complain that the salsa in not hot enough (even at Mexican places) but one bite here and there was a temporary spice assault upon my eyes and nose.  Both started to run and I loved every minute.  When your body reacts, you know you're eating good salsa.  My Pepsi came soon after wards and it was the largest drink I've ever been served save for a liter of beer I had at a German tavern in New York City.  My food arrived soon after wards and it was served on a scorching hot plate.  Everything was delicious and I think they make their own refried beans.  Possibly the best beans I've had at a Mexican place.  The dining area is larger than a fast food joint but smaller than your typical restaurant.  Not long after I arrived it started to fill up quickly.  Expect to wait a few minutes at peak times.  Sadly this structure was an impenetrable fortress for my phone and I was unable to officially do a Yelp check in but, eh, I cannot hold that against the Comedor.  I'd like to note that quite a few of the patrons were Hispanic and that, to me, is always a good sign when eating at a Mexican joint.  I have been waiting to find a Mexican restaurant that I can officially dub as the best I've had.  I am confident I can dub thee, Comedor Guadalajara, as the best I have had.  Can't wait to take any visitors I have here.",

The chips, carne asada, and carnitas were all sub-par. The rice was pretty good, however, as was the guacamole. The waiter had no clue about what type were the beers listed on the menu. The one shining star was the flan: perfectly smooth and creamy, and one of the best I've ever had. I'll be back for dessert- but ONLY for that.",

The enchiladas are great. The rice and beans with cheese are scrumptious. The flan is probably the best I ever had. If you love Mexican food like I do, definitely go here. I didn't try any of the fish dishes, but I saw a lot of people ordering them. The chips and salsa are good, but the salsa is more like hot sauce than salsa at other restaurants. I liked it a lot, but I could see how people with mellowed tastes might not love it. I am a fan of this place and will head directly there next time I am in phoenix.",

The Diavolo sauce was delicious and also spicy in a different way than the salsa for the chips.  I was given a large flour tortilla and couldn't resist dipping and redipping.  The sides of salad (standard shredded lettuce, etc., but very fresh and crunchy), rice and refried beans were substantial.  After the chips, main course, salad rice and tortilla I couldn't do more than scratch the surface of the refried beans.    I was equally happy with the atmosphere and service.  I showed up near 1pm on Sunday as a single diner.  Most of the other people were family groups, many apparently regulars.  I was nonetheless given a decent table normally seating four after the promised 10-15 minute wait and no sense of being rushed or treated differently by any of the staff.  Next time I'm in Phoenix I will be eager to come back (bringing family and/or friends) and have the same thing again and/or explore the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "Worst service ever.  My fiance and I have been shopping for a caterer for our upcoming wedding when we were told Comedor Guadalajara does catering. My fiance went in to get a few quotes and spoke with a nice lady by the name of Theresa. She was told we would get the food we requested at a good price! It put some of our worries at ease with the big day just around the corner. Fast forward 2 weeks and we do not hear from them for our second sit-down. We call and ask to speak  with Theresa, but find out she has been out sick. Understandable. We then ask who can help us with completing our order  and they reffer us to Tony, Theresa's Brother. After a few e-mails and un-returned phone calls, my fiance goes to comedor. Upon Arrival, my fiance meets with Tony- who tells her without warning that they no longer do catering. After a few questions we find out they are not catering because of Theresa's absence, even after we agreed to use them for our service. We finally get Tony to agree to do it (after he see's Theresa's note and only 3 more catering jobs before they quit offering the service) but he never calls us back again!  It turns out he changed his mind once more  and will not be doing our catering, but we dont find out until we call 3 times with no answer! They offer no explanation nor help in this matter, and leave it at that.  This restaurant has now put us in a situation where we have no caterer and are left wondering what will happen on our weeding date.    I for one will never go back to comedor nor reffer anyone, they gave us the run-around for the last month and put us in a predicament.",

So finally today for lunch I decided I need to go try this place out.  I was very glad I finally went.  I had the lunch special of a stuffed poblano and shrimp enchilada.  While waiting on my food I was greated with chips and a yummy spicy salsa and a soup with veggies and beef.  Both were very good and I was then worrying that I wouldn't have room to finish my meal.  Before I could decide to put away the chips the food arrived.  I was surprised how fast they cooked my meal and once I tasted it I was amazed with the great flavor of the sauces.  The enchilada had a very good tasting green sauce and the chile was smothered in a spicy red sauce with onions.  The rice and beans on the side were good but after finishing the main course I had just a bite of each to see what they tasted like.  I will have to head back again for dinner as the menu was full of wonderful items I wanted to try.",

    "text": "First time at Comedor Guadalajara. The visit was prompted by a small birthday celebration so I shlepped to Phoenix by the I17 from Scottsdale.  One should do anything for friends.  Outside the packed parking lot (on a Friday at 11:45AM), wonderful smells emanated from the place.  The inside is super large with various sub rooms around the place here and there.  You can easily not find your party there if you don't look around enough.   They had lunch specials ranging from about $8.95 to $10.50 or so.  All the specials included a small bowl of soup.  The waiters promptly placed soup bowls in front of every person even before they knew what they were going to order.  I wasn't ordering the lunch special but they gave me one anyway. I tasted it and it was nothing to write home about. The first bowl of chips and salsa are free, you pay a small amount if you request more.  Chips were fresh, not greasy and the salsa was kick-ass hot.  Nice.   My party ordered the various lunch specials, most of them involving enchiladas with various sauces, burritos, etc.  They all ate without saying a word so I guess they were enjoying their food.  They all love Mexican food so what was to complain about?   I ordered a small bowl of menudo (tripe soup @$8.50)) because most Mexican places make it only on the weekends so I took advantage of the  fact that I was there on a Friday.  The person across from me ordered three chicken tacos from the regular menu that came with rice and beans at a cost of $15.00 (ouch).  She let me taste the rice and beans and I must say the rice and beans were very tasty.  Some places serve yellow rice (with coloring) that is tasteless--Not here.  The chunks of chicken on the taco was unseasoned and dry.  She left two of them uneaten without regrets.   My menudo was not the best I have ever had and had that distinct \"offal\" smell which is not present at my favorite menudo place.  It was ok, I ate some of it and took the rest home to palm it off on someone else in the house.   They charge $6.00 for a Corona which I thought was a bit high considering the location of the restaurant.  Their dinner prices are a little hefty as well.   They don't split checks and add 18% tip for larger parties.   I would say that if the food had been spectacular I could see myself making the trek from Scottsdale to this restaurant.  But the food is not worth the trip for me.  I travel to Baja Joe's Mexican in Gilbert which is a trip for me but it is TOTALLY worth it.",

The ceilings are high and it makes it feel extremely large.   We ordered a lot of food, and for two people the bill only came out to $30 (without tip)!   The only thing that sucks is they do charge for the chips and salsa after your first round, but it is so cheap it doesn't matter (and it helps save you room for your meal)!   The burritos are mouthwatering , my stomach is growling just thinking of it. The beans and rice are amazing too, I had never really been a fan of them until I went to Comedor.   Overall, if you haven't been to Comedor-GET THERE STAT!!!",

We usually put in a order to go as the wait time is usually very long, not good when you have a 3 yr. old boy who wants to run around so we place an order to go! The cocido-Caldo de Rez is awesome and we usually do the chicken and carne asada parillada and it comes with generous rice and beans and tortillas chips and salsa! Love eating this in the comfort of my own home without long wait times. Best place in SoPho!",

The building sits a ton of people.   We ordered the Green Chili Beef Chimi. The chimi, rice and beans were  the perfect size to split. The green chili  had a great flavor, enough beef etc. The rice was good but the standout was the beans. Man they were good.   The chips and salsa are ok.

The food and service were really good and I had to leave early so I gave my cash to another Yelper and consequently did not have to deal with the cluster of paying in a large party with one check.  I had grilled chicken breast with eggs and beans.  The chicken was topped with a red sauce, grilled onions and some mild jalapenos.  The parking has gotten so bad they make employees park off the property so some have quit after several break ins to their cars.  In the evenings they have security but only in the lot. They have supposedly bought the property to the North and applied to expand the building and add parking.  Talking to long time Hispanic residents, the building was once a dance venue with live bands. The biggest hangups about this place are parking and getting seated.  It is not uncommon to wait almost an hour including weekday lunch times.",

    "text": "Comedor Guadalajara in S Central is housed in a great building.  Large restaurant - absolutely beautiful - high ceilings, with a comfortable waiting area, and spacious table arrangement.  Family oriented.  They definitely cater to the Mexi brethren.    The host guided us to the table for what seemed like the distance of an average Phoenix block and I was like, \"Oh this is still part of the restaurant?!\"  The menu is large enough for a nearsighted grandma complete with a few pictures for folk like me who are constantly asking:  what's that, how's it, who dat?    If you're short on cash that week or forgot your wallet you can easily fill up with the sopa appetizer (a vegetable pasta soup) they bring upon seating and the obligatory corn tortilla chips.    The chips were warm.  Mmmm.  And delicious with spicy salsa.  I also ordered some churros.  Made-to-order.  Hot hot hot and yum yum yum.  If I return to CG, it'll be with a different flock, and I would like to have a peck at one of the molcajetes or something out of the mariscos category because my own snobbish preference is for more upscale dishes.    Word to the wise:  if you want to eat here, you best be an early bird because they're not open all day.  And prepare to wait about 20 min for a table, even at the break of lunch time.  This place is more popular than a high school jock and cheerleader couple.",

We ordered from Comedor's catering menu:  green chicken enchiladas, chicken flautas (substitution of their tacos) and rice for our Halloween party.  Surprisingly, Comedor also included a quart size of guacamole, salsa, sour cream and two big bags of tortilla chips.  Prices were extremely reasonable and the food was amazing!  I'm not a big green chili fan but I am now!  Chunks of fresh green chili on the enchiladas and boy, were the enchiladas plump full of chicken!    I've decided that I'll never slave over a kitchen stove to prep for a party or get together.  El Comedor's catering menu saved me tons of time and headache AND it was extremely affordable.  I got to enjoy our party and everyone couldn't say enough great things about the food!",

Had the carne asada burrito and all it was a huge tortilla with some kind of really dry beef in it and that's it.. There was barely a teaspoon of guacamole and Pico de gallo to put in my burrito that was put in a container on the side. What the heck kinda burrito is this ?? :O sorry but I was born and raised in San Diego and this is not authentic.. Maybe to ARizonians it is lol I gave them 3 stars because their red hot (tomato sauce ) salsa was pretty good and their chips were not bad. Tried many Mexican  restaurants in AZ and none compare to Cali Mexican food.. I guess my taste buds are used to high quality flavor .. I give up searching for a good mex restaurant here.. The one and only good taco shop in AZ  is Senor Taco but they are actually from San Diego so they know what authentic is. ;-D but anyways this   Place wasn't horrible for AZ standards it's pretty decent",

As a solo eater, I was seated within 15min. Unfortunately, I was seated at a table for four people. I apologized to my server, but he smiled and said it was ok.  He remainder attentive throughout and provided excellent service. I tipped well beyond the norm. The interior is a cross between a mid to low priced restaurant with its booths and a high school cafeteria with its plain tables and chairs in the center of the restaurant. The food was good, but not great.  I had Pollo en Mole (Chicken Mole), and was actually disappointed in the mild flavor. It was missing the richness that I usually enjoy in this meal. The beans and rice were normal for any Mexican restaurant. It was a nice touch to get a bowl of soup with my chips. I also enjoyed a large draft Negra Modelo. At $3 is was a steal. I visited one other time and had a breakfast burrito.  It was certainly more flavorful than the mole, but still it did not meet my expectations.  If I could give a half star, I would have given 3.5, instead of 4. However, the friendly wait staff and quick/inexpensive bar service give it the extra half. I will return, but I will try to skip the lunch rush.",

You have to tell them how much to charge on your card simply because they don't offer an itemized check. So pretty much do their job for them. Gratuity isn't even an option like most places. Even if the service wasn't great, they still expect you to leave a tip. Never again.",

My husband and I got the shredded beef tacos and enchiladas. The shredded beef was so dry and overcooked that I only ate half my taco and was over it.  The beef enchilada was filled with huge chunks of beef, which were tender but lacking in flavor.  The rice and beans were nothing special.  oh yeah....  the chips they bring out when you arrive come with tiny bowls of salsa that you can barely dip your chips in because of how small and shallow the bowls are.",

It doesn't look like much on the outside, but it is quite comfortable and nicely done inside.  From the chips and salsa at the start to the blazing hot main course, the food was great.  I had a burrito, taco and cheese enchilada combo plate with rice and refried beans on the side.  The burrito was huge and tasty, the taco crisp and filled with fresh lettuce, and the rice and refried beans were tasty. The enchilada was so-so and it was the only disappointment.  The service was fair, a little disappointing given that it was not that busy.  The price is excellent for the food you get.  A real value!",

We still go regularly, mostly for my dad's or mom's b-day celebration.. or with my in-laws.  One thing I've noticed throughout the years about this establishment is that they have the same waiters ... I'm talking working there for at least the 15-20 years that we've been going to this place.  That is kind of impressive, you know.  So, what to order?  Well, if your idea of a Sunday afternoon (when we usually go) is to have a nice lunch and then have a functional, productive afternoon... don't eat here!  It doesn't really matter what you order.  99% of the time what you will be served is an elliptical plate with a 24\" major diameter that is chock full of greasyass refried beans, brown (aka Mexican) rice, and some other main dish that is covered in creamy salsa, cheese, or both!    I'm not saying it's bad (yes, it's bad for you) tasting, because it is actually quite tasty.. but, you 100% of the time regret ordering these dishes because of how you feel afterwards.  You're just bound to feel like a pig... heck, just wear your stretchy pants and one of those puffy blouses (gals, they are in style now) that way you can hide the bulge that will be your bloated belly.  Sigh... this is why I just get the fajitas these days...  The staff is mostly Spanish speaking (fine with me) and so are the patrons of the restaurant.  You'll pay a nominal price, be surrounded by lots of Mexicans, hear some typical Mexican music (hey, maybe you'll get a song from the mariachis that stalk the tables), and eat like a pi... person that has been starved and has finally been fed.",

We started with mango margaritas for $4,00 Yum. Taco and enchilada happy hour plate. Chicken flauta combo plate. Carnitas fried juicy pork loin which comes out on a hot iron skillet,absolutely delicious. All plates served with great beans, then the rice. Carnita dish also comes with choice of tortillas and a little guacamole and pico. We enjoyed our visit.",

I'm glad to report it was still delicious!  My party of 3 arrived at around 7 p.m. on Friday night. They quoted us a 25-30 minute wait. Thankfully, there is plenty of seating for those who are waiting, and it ended up only being about 15 minutes.  Our waitress was prompt with taking our drink orders and bringing out chips and salsa. My two friends started of with Micheladas. Although I am not a fan of Micheladas in general, my two friends loved the ones here. They also came in a ginormous beer mug, so make sure you're thirsty!  The chips and salsa were perfect! They mild salsa was kind of bland, but the spicy one was really flavorful and had the perfect kick. The chips were also perfectly cooked and not greasy.  For my meal, I had the green chili and potatoes, rice beans, and corn tortillas. A few of the tortillas were a weird crispy texture, and although the meat was good, it was a little dry. However, the rice and beans were great! Those were definitely some of the best beans I've had at a Mexican restaurant. They also had the perfect amount of cheese instead of the mounds that some places slop on.  My friends really enjoyed their meals- the machaca plate and a two taco combo plate. The tacos looked really good--I will be definitely ordering those next time!  One of the best parts was the value. The portions were huge--you could definitely share an entree here. My meal was about $10, and if I didn't completely pig out, I definitely could have taken home enough leftovers for a second meal.",

It was our first time and definitely won't be our last. I can't wait to dive into the breakfast menu bright and early on a Sunday. Thank you for the amazing dinner and quality time with my spouse. I wouldn't pass this place up folks!!!! It's definitely a must try no matter the wait.",

I love the specials board, though I am still a little hesitant to break down and try the Tripas. The seafood can be pricey but that can be expected in the middle of the deserts. Amazing enchiladas and haven't had a bad thing yet.   The dining room is massive with a couple different sections, so you typically don't have to wait, though there are a lot of people there. It can be a little scary looking from the outside since it is right off the freeway in a fairly scarce neighborhood. There is also a security guard in the parking lot to add some mystique. However, once you get yourself in the restaurant you are put to ease by the comfortable seating and laid back atmosphere. Typically too stuffed for dessert, so someone else will have to clue you in on that.",

Simple but delicious: Corn tortillas, enchilada sauce, cheese, and onions (optional). That's it.  And, that's all it takes.  It is rumored that I am the only person to have touched more cookies than a Keebler Elf. That might be True. The claims that Comedor Guadalajara has the best enchiladas in Phoenix. Well, simply put, that's True. These enchiladas are so good that if Comedor Guadalajara was in a rap battle it would simply pull back the foil on a plate of these hellafide gangsta enchildas and drop the Mic!",

Completely safe, guarded, protected, patrolled parking lot for those of you scared to venture into unfamiliar territories. Outstanding from beginning to end. From friendly, enthusiastic welcomes, to prompt tableside attention. Delicious Margarita and Dos Equis to wash down fresh chips, and fiery salsa served in a delightful tiny gravy boat for pouring or dipping. At least 4 servers tending to your every whim from delivering food, to clearing plates. Presentation is everything and here they do it right! From spotless, immaculately clean everything, everywhere you look, to pressed slacks and dress shirts on all the servers, there is pride in everyone's performance here. The food is the Bonus! Excellent flavor, robust and tangy, complex, plentiful, fresh and filling. You want to clean your plate! Prices are more than fair and reasonable for what you get! Charming Mexico Decor throughout without being gawdy or cheesy. Nice enough to impress a date before a concert or show Downtown. Absolutely my favorite place to dine in South Phoenix.",

Jaguar Pride What!! anyways..the vast openess and still confined spacing of the restaurant. if there was a fire breakout..i don't think anyone would make it out alive tho. :(  carnitas were bombdigity yaheard!! get on it.   price is affordable, and the menu distinctly not, run of the mill \"mexican food\"",

    "text": "There's no better way to undo a 3 mile morning walk than to end up stuffing your face at the Comedor.  This place is muy grande and could be the perfect spot for a very very large dinner party. The parking lot is huge and is tended by courteous security guards who welcome you in at the door. The menu is extensive and offers some unusual items such as Chicharrone (pork rind) and Nopales (cactus) dishes along with an interesting   Caldo de Mariscos (Seafood Soup). Great if you're looking for some food adventure! Que suave~  I started my post walk lunch with a cold Pacifico that came with a large frosty mug. Man that beer went down good!  The chips were delivered warm with a side of chili tepin style salsa.  For starters, we ordered the Frijoles con Chorizo dip. I'm not huge fan of chorizo but really enjoyed this dip. The chorizo was mild (not greasy at all) and was served with oven toasted chips topped with melted cheese. We shared a plate of the Chili Verde con Papas which is a rich green chili sauce with chunks of beef, potatoes, and onions served with refried pinto beans and tortilla. For our other dish, we had the Chilaquiles Y Huevos. This dish was the main reason we went to Comedor and it didn't disappoint.  This was layered corn tortillas soaking in a red chili sauce and topped with two over medium eggs and served with a side of frijoles and warm tortilla. The only problem I ran into was eating way more then I should have. It must be a good sign if you waddle out of the place whining and holding your gut.  I'll be heading back very soon to try the Nopalito dish and the Pescado Entero Tilapia; Pan Freed \"whole\" Tilapia. Can't wait!",

This is a large restaurant that has added more and more dinning space over the last 30 years and yet they still are always packed. They could build a second location, but they obviously are content to concentrate on this location. So be prepared for wait times and sometimes it's even hard to find parking.

If you want a better tasting tampiquena go to Manuel's instead.  Food here is just average, if that...  To make matters worse, they \"ran out\" of horchata at 3pm on a Saturday, what kind of \"mexican restaurant \"allows that!",

Wait was short though.  Service wasnt super speedy but not excessively long.     Not the food, we got Tacos, enchiladas, and chille rellenos.  (Spelling sorry). It was EXCELLENT!!   Some of the best I've eaten of this type. Even the beans and rice was great!!  The salsa was to die for.  Its the hot type and it did have a kick to it but not over powering. It would have been nice to not get all broken chips from the bottom of the batch though. Both basket fulls were all broken.   They have two dinning rooms, if your in for a quiet meal, ask for the front one as the back was quite loud.     I cant quite give it a 5 but the food certainly was.",

Second do they have a good beef, chicken offering to make their dishes with, check,  Do they have good menudo only on the weekend or if they have the rest of the week do they make everyday? Yes indeed on the weekend option.  Do they use the term burros instead of the California/Texas burrito marketing term - ok on this non-food related item they turned to the dark side.  Do they have mole that makes me happy - yes for sure.  Do they have Bohemia beer - yes.  They hit all the marks plus they do them all well.  Oh yeah - love their tacos.",

Instead of handing it to me she puts it under the counter and says absolutely nothing to the man running the take out counter. He finally realizes it after 15 minutes and tries to hand it to me and I question why they didn't say anything to me and just let my food sit there and get cold. I didn't want them taking it out on my food because many members of their staff are rude. I'm done giving them my money. Bad customer service, horrible smelling bathrooms, and no care for their customers will eventually hurt them. I won't recommend them any more either.",

I love the teamwork because it shows how smoothly things went. I enjoyed how they brought my son his food first. Then few minutes later they brought ours. Food was extremely delicious. I was soo full but I still keep trying to eat more. That's just how delicious it was. I've never had really good rice till I ate their rice.

Probably not, we had to wait 20-25 minutes to have a basic Mexican meal. Not too mention my melon margaritas were $10 a pop and I didn't even catch a good buzz from it.

    "text": "Boy am I glad to be back home! My recent trip to Ohio gave me a new perspective on Mexican cuisine. Basically, it doesn't exist east of the Mississippi. But holy cow, does it exist at Comedor Guadalajara!  This past weekend, while trying to decide where to grab some lunch, a friend made an excellent suggestion to visit Comedor Guadalajara. She was familiar with this restaurant which is just south of downtown at Central and I-17. It's tricky to get into off Central if you're exiting the freeway, but there is a back entrance off the next street to the west.  The parking lot was full and that's always a good sign. Our wait was only 15 minutes in spite of how busy they were. And my companion also noticed something that I look for. The overwhelming majority of the guests we saw waiting, dining and leaving, were not gringos like myself. This was also a good sign!  A quick look at the menu and the first taste of the salsa delivered to the table tells you this place isn't messing around. The chips are hot and the salsa is even hotter. This is the kind of spice I warned the mid-westerners about. Love it!  A couple of huge, ice-cold cervezas on draft were the perfect accompaniment to this meal. And since I was still craving breakfast, I selected my old standby... Machaca con Huevo. This may be the best and most generous portion of Machaca I have ever enjoyed. And not only was it flavorful and spicy, but the sides were just as excellent. Clearly, someone labored over these refried beans. And Comedor Guadalajara has THE BEST Mexican rice I've ever tasted! I ate every bit of the rice on my plate before anything else. It's that good!  Everything was perfect. The atmosphere, the service, the food and drink, and the price. I'm impressed and will absolutely be back. I've got to share this treasure with more friends. Muchas gracias!",

Very flavorful.  He never has any complaints. The green chile is amazing! Large portion size and the rice and beans are soo good! I can never finish my plate as its so big..enough to share for 2 people. The kids get the kids quesadilla plate and love it. Its a good place to come and grab a bite to eat. They are reasonably priced and always have specials and new menu items to try. You won't regret it. :)",

There is a reason this place is always packed and I can't say it's because of its centralized location.   We came here in the middle of a late lunch rush but were seated rather quickly and didn't have to wait in the lobby. Chips and salsa came out immediately as with most Mexican food restaurants. The salsa is always super hot to me, but still very good.   I was here for a work meeting and needed something that wasn't tremendously heavy. Ordered a simple bean burrito with red enchilada sauce and a small side of rice. Very good and I literally almost licked my plate clean.   I will always recommend this place to out-of-town guests and anyone needing a large space for groups.",

The menu does offer a variety of seafood dishes, but I went with a \"menudo (tripe stew) bowl\". Had to have a house margarita to compliment my meal. The dish came out within minutes, and the server was very nice and efficient. My dish was steaming hot, so I sipped slowly with anticipation of the delicious flavors of the soupy based menudo. The hominy, cilantro, and lemon squeezed in the bowl made this dish even yummier. You also get a side of either corn or flour tortilla. Overall nice experience at a historic Mexican restaurant!",

We put our names down and they called us 10 minutes later (not bad for how many people were waiting).  They have a large dining area and lots of parking.  When we sat down, they brought us chips and salsa and soup.  The soup was yummy.  The chips were disgusting -- you could taste the grease that they were fried in (YUCK!).    I ordered the beef taco and cheese enchilada lunch special.  The taco was decent (very small) and the cheese enchilada had onions in it which were crunchy when you bit into them.  I thought I ordered a cheese enchilada but I guess they forgot to put cheese AND onion enchilada on the menu.  I still judge a place by it's beans and these were nasty.  You could taste the lard.  My coworker ordered the chile relleno and chicken enchilada lunch special.  She didn't like her food either.    After we left, she apologized and admitted she would probably never go there again either.",

I loved you as a child, when we would try to sneak into the pseudo-night club side and take peeks and our moms would drag us back like trouble-making ne'er-do-wells.   You've changed a lot since then, dropping the Crystal Palace half of your moniker, but your food is still as good as it always was.  You're cheap, you taste great and you give a lot, even if your looks aren't spectacular, just like my favorite hookers (what?).  The Pechuga Asada, two whole chicken breasts grilled and tender, on top of a mound of rice and beans, is so delectable and awesome that I want to eat it constantly.  But how can I, when the machaca chimichanga enchilada-style with plentiful guacamole and other assorted accoutrement beckon me?    And what of you, Green Chili?  Your almost-soupy consistency, the potatoes, the carne, the color, the tortilla...too much to handle.    Oh, others, they will say that it tastes the same as other Mexican restaurants to them.  That's because they haven't been spoon-fed all this shit for the past 25 years like we have, day in and day out, beaners that we are.  We can taste the slightest change in the amount of cumin, or how much salt, or the way someone cuts their meat before cooking it, or the way they make their spanish rice, because we've eaten so damned much of it.   So that's how I know that this isn't so run-of-the-mill.  That's why I love you, Comedor Guadalajara.    You're totally still a cutie, even at your ripe old age.

All was fine until I got a call 90 minutes after leaving the restaurant from my credit card company at 10pm asking me if I was at Frys Grocery and had just before been at Home Depot, seeing as I was at home I replied no.  I had left my credit card in the check presenter and somehow it made it's way to into someones hands that obviously was not me.  To say I was annoyed would be an understatement, that is until I called the owner the next day and explained the gravity of the situation, she had the nerve to tell me that it was basically my fault and that her staff would never do anything like that and that she would do nothing about it, not even an apology!! In the days of Social Media, not taking customers seriously is risky business, i have shared this story with 50 plus people and I am sure they have shared it with some more.  I have left my credit card at several restaurants over the years and have always been confident in the honesty of a business and next day retrieved it and not had someone go shopping in my absence.

When the chips and salsa arrived my excitement died a bit but I try not to judge on chips and salsa alone. We ordered a plain cheese crisp as an appetizer and it was actually pretty good; it was crispy and not too oily. The main dishes arrived and they were a major disappointment! The tacos were oily and bland. The beans and rice were not much better. Overall this is typical Americanized Mexican food; overly fried, bland, and greasy like most Mexican places.

    "text": "my husband and I were driving by this place the other day and not knowing anything about it decided we would give it a try.  I was pleased with the food. I got a bit of food envy when my husband's dish was way yummier than what I ordered.  I got the tacos with beef and potatoes combination. I forget the exact name of the dish my husband ordered, but it was sort of a shrimp burrito dish. It had plenty of shrimp in it and was very tasty. My tacos were good, but I was disappointed at the amount of potatoes in it. I was hoping for a layer of potatoes and a layer of beef, but what they do is mix bits of potato with the beef. It was still good.   Their chips and salsa are decent. The salsa for me gets a bit too spicy after a while.   I would definitley go again if I'm in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "Along the lines of south Phoenix Mexican restaurants, Comedor Guadalajara is one of the more authentic places out there. They've got a friendly atmosphere, inexpensive prices, and a menu encompassing both the familiar (enchilladas, braised meat dishes, etc.) to the more special dishes in Mexican fare that you don't see terribly often in Phoenix (like great chicken mole and offally good menudo). The first time I went here was with an ex-boyfriend and his parents and I played it safe because I think I was 19 and didn't know this type of Mexican cuisine too well. However, over the years, this has become a fast favorite and if you're looking for a nice place to grab a decent lunch or dinner in SoPho then this (and LoLo's) come with high recommendations.",

But seriously every since i can remember the food has always been authentic and delicious. The service has always been great too. They accommodate to large parties as well. Make sure you get here early on the weekends tho, It get SUPER BUSY and will most likely have to wait for a table. But trust me, you want to wait. Over the years this place got more and more popular and has gone through alot of extensions and renovations but has always remained the same as far as the food goes. I remember they use to have live mariachis coming table to table asking if they would like a song. They were great as well, but i can see why they arent there anymore. Alot of business people come here now since its downtown but This place is hands down my favorite and only Mexican restaurant i eat at, and ive been Mexican my entire life. Trust me. EAT HERE!",

The inside is pretty large. There are two huge dining rooms. There is also quite a large staff as the place can get pretty busy.   The food is the real standout. I've tried several things off the menu and all of them have been pretty tasty. Heres a short list of my recommendations:  Tripas y carne fajitas - delicious  Fried red snapper - frkn awesome  Raw oysters - fresh and very clean  Pico de gallo - one of my favorites in town  Shrimp and Octopus in chipotle sauce (a la Diavolo) - mouth watering sauce. I could seriously drink it and/or swim in it. You can get it w/ just shrimp if octopus isn't your thing.   I've had many other items that were great but cant remember them. The beans and rice are just decent. Not bad but not great. The beans are a little on the cheesy side. The price is pretty good too. They also have mariachi bands at night on the weekends. If you are looking for a wide variety of dishes and a place that can accommodate large groups, or just looking to try some outstanding Mexican food you should try out Comedor.",

When we arrived, we had to be flagged into a parking space by one of their parking attendant (very nice feature) as the lot was very full. There was a 45 min. wait and lots of people waiting! We met a family who used to live in McAllen, Tx, and they raved about this place, so we decided to wait it out, esp. after all the other good Yelp reviews. It's in an interesting part of town, so it wasn't like there was another Mexican restaurant five min. away like at home. Hubs had the carne asada tacos and I had the combo #8. The beef was outstanding! Good flavor and charred to perfection!!! Large portions! The rest of the meal (beans, rice, tortillas, taco & guacamole) were good, but we're very, very spoiled Texans. If we lived here full-time, this would be our place definitely, but compared to home, this was a good, but nothing to 110% rave about. However, the service, mango margarita's and warm churro (soooooo good!) sundae allow us to overall give it the four star rating.",

If that's the case, so do Acapulco, El Torito, Arriba and Macayo's. Nevermind the location. I have strayed into much more intimidating parts of other cities and towns and come out unscathed. Anyone who is concerned about the location or the security guard will either feel that they were adventurous threatened. You can decide for yourself which to pick. AS FOR THE FOOD... it's horribly average. Yes they make a good michelada, but the food itself is too fried, has too much lard, and just doesn't have much charm. I don't want cheddar cheese on my Mexican food. I don't want Jack In The Box style tacos. I don't need beans and rice on the same plate. The green chile is better at Carolina's or Rito's or El Norteno.  If you want fatty americanized Mexican food, go to Comedor. If not, I suggest you skip it.",

The enchilada sauce at Comeodor Guadalajara is incredible especially smothered over a red chili con carne burrito.  There is not much I can complain about at this restaurant.  The service is very good and the pricing is affordable.   If I was to make a complaint, it would be that the place gets too crowded at lunch time.   Go before 11:15 AM for lunch or you will have to wait for a seat especially on Friday.  I guess that is a good problem to have from the restarurant point of view.   I highly recoomend this place.",

Let me tell you, this place is legit.  #3, the service is always fast and friendly.  The only opportunity they have is with their Huevos Rancheros, im a fan of Rancheros but their Ranchero sauce was heavy on the tomato sauce and onion, I felt needed more complexity and adding in some Hatch or Anaheim long green would have made the sauce better.  Other than that, I highly recommend the tacos, chimichangas, flautas, enchiladas and Menudo.  You won't go wrong with this place.",

    "text": "This is an authentic south Phoenix barrio restaurant. White folks in the dining room are in a pitiful minority, which is always a sign of good ethnic cuisine. As others have mentioned the decor is not necessarily hip, nor is the grand dining area particularly cozy, but I still liked the atmosphere.   Affirming its authentic barrio status, when the waitress approached my nonwhite but also non-Hispanic self, she greeted us with \"Buenos tardes. Como estan?\" Having just returned from vacation in Argentina where I grew accustomed to these greetings despite my inability to speak Spanish, I quickly responded, \"Buenos tardes, bien gracias.\" In Buenos Aires I was quickly identified by most waiters as a tourist so the conversation would then continue in English. Back here in my own hometown of Phoenix it's a slightly different story. Confusion reigned after I got out my Spanish response. She asked me something. I looked at her puzzled and instead of saying simply, \"I don't speak Spanish\" I reflexively said, \"Como?\" which of course extended the linguistic chaos at our table, because she then repeated herself and naturally I repeated my look of confusion. She probably wanted to smack me by the time we figured out what was going on. She was gracious though.   The food was superb. I ordered something I'd never tried before: machaca con huevos. My mouth waters at the very thought of it. For the unacquainted, machaca is basically shredded beef. It was mixed up with egg, onions, tomatoes, and peppers, and came with a side of beans and rice. My friend had a more standard plate of cheese enchiladas and a tostada, and she also gave it the thumbs up.  The service was quick and friendly. The atmosphere, though criticized elsewhere for its decor, was actually pretty interesting to me mainly because of my fellow customers. There were some large families there, from all walks of life.   I'm definitely going back, especially since I live close by.",

    "text": "Mexican food is funny because it's one cuisine that we tend to have so many favorites in that we need to make sub-categories. As such Comedor Guadalajara would be filed in my database as the Mexican seafood place that I won't eat all day in anticipation of over-eating at. This is a very thin category, in fact it's the only one. The Veracruz style snapper is single-handedly responsible for keeping me from moving to another city. The shrimp tacos certainly pitch in on this retention campaign as well. Let's go back to the snapper for a moment, shall we? This dish serves an ample portion of fresh snapper  in a near stew-like combination of jalapenos, onions, bay leaves and a rich tomato sauce. If that's not enough, you have the option to add shrimp.   If I'm not feeling like eating off the coast, the chicken mole is sure to get my vote. The mole here is so good that I get a little insulted when I see it on menus elsewhere. The chicken is pulled from the bone and seems stewed as it's very tender and juicy.   Service is always quick and friendly here. Decor is not the most inspiring here, but in Mexican restaurants I think that is a badge of honor. Folks of my pale pigment may pass on this place because it's location is rather industrial and low rent. That's fine by me, they can go to Macayo's and I'll take my usual booth under the spray painted swordfish.",

    "text": "I've driven by here a few times, but this weekend decided to take the plunge.  I'm so glad I did.  Comedor Guadalajara's exterior is pretty unassuming.  Looks like a brownish/pinkish box.  Once you walk in, you can see that while they have some nice Mexican items, let's just say you won't be paying for the decor.  When I went by Sunday afternoon their after church crowd was huge.  I was just getting mine to go luckily.  I didn't hear anyone quoted more than a 10-15 min wait - and some of those were crowds of 8-10.  Walking through the restaurant - it's huge!  There is so much seating I can understand why it was the go to spot.    Also, I loved the mix of folks.  There was this guy in a cowboy hat, plaid shirt w/ jeans tucked into his cowboy boots standing right next to a guy in a full suit w/ a snazzy tie and shiny shoes.  It was really a great snapshot of Downtown/Southern Phoenix.  So yea, there were like 2 white groups.  But the rest of this place was a somewhere in the brown scale.  Black, Hispanic and mixed folks all hanging out waiting for the food.  To me, this is a good sign.    The Chicken Chimi was absolutely amazing.  Some of the most flavorful chicken pieces with lots of red & green pepper and onions.  I also tried their Pechuga Asado which was really good.  3 lunch meals, plus a 60 cent \"to go charge\" (weird, huh?) came out to $35.19.  We will definitely be going back again next time to try all their amazing seafood platters.  While they looked outstanding, I didn't think they were quite \"to go\" kind of food.  Something to look forward to next time...",

There was a brief wait for a seat. When seated the waitress brought a small bowl of soup before we ordered anything. We had to ask for chips, and the three of us got two small bowls. We were not charged for them or the second bowl of salsa.  The food arrived promptly. I paid $8.25 for a Chili Relleno, white rice and beans. The Chili was very large, but when I went to eat it, water pressed out from it. It tasted good, but the cheese was not warm enough to be smooth. Salsa only came one way: hot. It was a good thing because the chili really needed it. If you order a taco with shredded beef, they will charge you extra for it. The standard taco comes with ground beef and potato.  Comedor Guadalajara does not have TV's or loud background music. The parking lot is large, but it was nearly full at lunchtime. The two star rating could mean I missed something.",

This place is awesome   I love Mexican food in general but u feel (usually) Mexican food is very similar in quality no matter where you go, sure there's a few bad places, but in general it's always about the same.  This place is AWESOME!! The food is always delicious the menu is a bit more unique than other places I've been and the service is always good,  The only issue is the wait, there is always a wait.  This is the only restaurant I can think of where I routinely go back and every third time go some place else because the wait is too long  I would say 30-45 min is worth it most of the time but 1 hour might be too long and certainly 1 hour 20 is way too long.

More chips, expect to pay more. Which BTW chips tasted old and stale. Hot sauce was just plain hot sauce. Mild salsa or more salsa and theres an extra charge for that. Menu has chicken enchiladas but you want just a cheese enchilada. That'll cost you extra. Beans on a separate plate that'll cost you extra too. Waiter explained it takes cook more time to put beans on another plate so that costs $2 more. More than 6 at your table? Pay extra!! Customers used to be served a complimentary sopa (soup) with a meal but now thats gone. Food is good but looks like this place has gotten real greedy and will nickel and dime you to death.  We wont be back. Going to Pancho's Mex Food on Central which has a more welcoming atmosphere and food is good and authentic.",

    "text": "My husband and I ate dinner here with the International Supper Club UYE group a couple of nights ago. We were both happy to see that they had such a great selection of Mexican beers and so hubby was able to get a Bohemia instead of settling for the usual Corona or XX. I was super happy to order a Michelada and as always that put me in the mood for seafood which is perfect since Comedor Guadalajara not only has traditional Mexican entrees but a variety of Mexican style seafood dishes on their menu.  Even though we were served chips and salsa immediately upon being seated, we decided to start with the chorizo bean dip since that sounded pretty tasty. I was expecting it to be served in a small dish like the salsa but instead it came out with a giant portion and a bunch of thicker chips topped with melted cheese. Fortunately my fellow Yelpers helped us out but we still couldn't finish it. I love bean dip in general but this one had a great flavor from the chorizo and I didn't feel like it was too greasy. I would say that the chorizo bean dip is a must-order if you are with a group.  After that, we got our entrees. My hubby got the Tampiquena steak which was a skirt steak seasoned and broiled and served with rice and beans. Most people would call that carne asada so I am not sure why they didn't name it that on the menu. I thought Tampiquena was when they chop up the steak and put chili sauce and cheese on it. But I haven't seen that outside of Texas so maybe that's a regional thing, I don't know. Anyway, he loves steak so was happy with the meat but he thought the rest of it was just ok. Growing up on the border we are picky about tortillas and these were not very authentic looking and he said they also were not great tasting but not bad either.  I ordered the Campechana and that also turned out to be a humongous portion (see pic). They serve it in a huge bowl like soup instead of a tall footed glass dish like seafood cocktail (cockteles) are usually served in. However, it wasn't really that much more substance in the bowl, it seemed to be mostly Clamato. I did like the flavoring of the broth but I thought the quality of the seafood could have been better. I also thought it was really weird that they served it with lemons and not limes. That kind of gave it a weird taste but I added some more hot sauce and that fixed it!  Even though its not the best Mexican food I've had we still had a really good time. It's a pretty nice looking restaurant, I am really surprised that some of the other reviewers called it a dive? Also, our waitress Anna was awesome and everyone else we interacted with seemed really nice as well.",

Service was good as always but what made me give it a three star rating is because we saw now that they charge for ordering a second bowl of chips and salsa (from what I know that didn't happen before) and because we order the mini nachos which were not nachos at all! They were 4 tostadas de frijoles with cheese and tomatoes sprinkled on top. My boyfriend asked if we could get the jalapenos on the side because he doesn't like jalapenos but I do. Our server then proceeded to tell us that if we order the jalapenos on the side they would charge us extra because they would see it as a side instead of us just having it on the side of the plate so we just asked to remove the jalapenos as a whole so we wouldn't get charged extra. I have attached a picture of the \"mini nacho\" AKA tostada de frijoles.",

    "text": "In a town with an astronomical number of options for Mexican cuisine, its hard to stand out.  The one thing that stands out about Comedor (at least to me), is the sheer scale of their operation.  Huge parking lot, huge waiting area, huge restaurant, huge menu, you get the idea.  I've been told that depending on your arrival time, the wait can be epic.  On a Saturday at lunch, I came here with a friend and the wait was a pretty benign 10 minutes.  Once seated, I pretty much settled into a familiar groove as the menu, the service, and the flavors all reminded me of local Mexican establishments I'd frequented for years.  We were actually seated all the way in the back room.  Took us about three left turns to get there, but even the back room was packed.  That said, the place wasn't crazy noisy.  Very casual, comfortable atmosphere inside.  Our server was on her A game the whole meal as she was friendly, fast, and accommodating.  I had asked my friend what (if anything) was the signature dish of the house, but she couldn't really point to any one thing so I decided to go for a combo plate this go around.  Since this is a Sonoran Mexican food establishment, I figured a collection of familiar Sonoran favorites would be a appropriate.  Combination Plate #1 contains a cheese enchilada, beef taco, bean tostada, rice and beans.  For $9, I figured that would be a good way to peer into Comedor's own house take on these familiar staples.  Food came out less than 10 minutes after we ordered.  The food was good, though you could be forgiven for thinking you were eating the exact same food with the exact same taste as other local Mexican establishments.  I suppose that's not necessarily a bad thing if you're like me and enjoy food at said establishments, but my friend was correct that none of the items really exceed any other place I've been.  My favorite item was the beef taco and it reminds me of one I've had at La Pinata.  The enchilada was also good and it reminded me of one I've had at Macayo's.  The beans and rice were also good and reminded me of those I've had at Mejico Cocina.  So all in all, the food was tasty and familiar, but you can absolutely find these staples at various Mexican establishments throughout the valley.  The big difference here is just a matter of scale.  Total cost for the combo plate, glass of water, tax and tip came to about $12.  The entire menu is pretty inexpensive (which likely explains the huge crowds here) and there's plenty of variety on the menu to choose from.  Next time I come here I'll probably give the seafood menu a try (though it'll probably remind me a lot of Mariscos Playa Hermosa).  So three stars for the food as it was good even though the cuisine didn't stand out too much from other similar valley establishments.  Four stars for the ambiance and atmosphere as the environment is super comfortable, family friendly and the restaurant is well kept inside and out.  And five stars for the service as they did a great job getting us seating pretty quickly despite the crowds, the server was excellent, and I had no trouble getting a parking spot at their huge lot.  So yeah, four stars is probably about right.  A good value for people of pretty much any means, only super-sized.",

Highlight was the ceviche as it was fresh and flavorful.  Pass on the raw oysters as they lacked flavor and they didn't come with any special sauce.  The rice and beans were bland, but the large grilled flour tortilla was very good.   The fajitas for two and more looked very good.   The place is not nice inside and doesn't have any charm.... Feels like being in a large warehouse without character.",

I lived in Tucson for 7 years and I have always struggled to find a good Mexican restaurant in the valley. Everything from the salsa, to the cheese crisp, to the enchilada style chicken burrito, to the raw seafood something or other my husband ordered was absolutely perfect. The service was decent too on a Friday night at 7 pm. We will definitely drive here from chandler again! Highly recommended!!",

The salsa they bring with your chips is hot and delicious. Ordered the \"three meat plate\" (for two) and was bombarded by a metal skillet (with it's own built in burner) heaped with a mountain of steak, chicken, pork, jalapenos, and onions. It was a meal for 4! The flavors were exquisite.  The Bad: The decor is bland, and the lights are brighter than the sun.  The Ugly: Nothing at all was ugly about the place. The staff and patrons were all very friendly. The bathroom was clean. The place felt safe outside even after dark (they have a security guard posted at the door).",

    "text": "I want to be as fair as I can when I am writing this review. I am not a native of Arizona and I think this may make my review somewhat biased. I wasn't too impressed with the food here. I had a chili relleno and a chicken burrito, both smothered. The portions were large, as expected in a Mexican food restaurant, the service was good, the gentleman that was helping us was extremely courteous. The margarita that I ordered (strong) I needed an extra shot, it wasn't strong enough for me. When this happened the Manager came over to me to make sure everything was ok - which was awesome! Needless to say, I added the shot and the margarita got demolished!  My chili relleno was a little soggy and I asked for it extra crispy, not too important, but I just wanted it cooked a little longer than normal. One SUPER positive things I can say about Comedor Guadalajara is that they had some of the best rice and beans I have ever had!  All in all, I think my overall experience has to do with the Mexican food here tasting distinctly different than the Mexican food in Denver, both of which are as authentic as you can get, not this Tex Mex B.S. When I go back to Phoenix, would I come back here, probably not, I would want to try a different place to see if they have a different Phoenix, authentic Mexican food flare. If I was invited to go back and somebody was paying for me, I would definitely go, however; I would order something different.",

The nachos are basically 4 or 5 tostada's cut in half.  You get a layer of beans, topped with jalapeno's, cheese and chicken. A side of guacamole and sour cream come with this plate.  The chicken chimi enchilada style with the red sauce is beyond words. It's the same chicken used in the nachos. I basically lick the plate clean.   I have also tried the shrimp enchiladas - too shrimp tasting for my taste, but my sister -in-law, who's big into seafood really enjoyed them. Comes with a lot of shrimp.  The carne asada tacos - were fantastic.  If you want really well done Mexican food don't waste your money anywhere else. Just come here. The wait staff is excellent and attentive.",

Hot sauce, chips, guacamole (though I think it has sour cream in it), enchilada sauce (both green and red), tacos, crispy cheese crisps, tasty medium-heat green chiles -- all good!   The only item that was lesser to my taste was the chile relleno, though the red tomato sauce on it was delicious.  Give it a shot. There's a reason why this restaurant has been successful for so long.",

It's really delicious, I finished the whole thing at once. The saute onion was fragranced and the chicken was really tender. The beans in my opinion was good, it has a different taste...I can't really tell what it is, but together with the whole meal, it was good.  Prices are reasonable. Service was quick and friendly.

We did manage to find a parking spot and we got into the restaurant but we had to wait a bit because there was a line. Once we got in our Waiter got to our table properly. He pretty much just took our orders and brought our drinks. There was another guy who brought out our meals. The items that we order were absolutely delicious.

    "text": "Comedor Guadalajara was the place picked for May's breakfast club, let's just get the eh parts out of the way 1st, They do not take any reservations (so I was told) but they do have plenty of seating but you have to wait until at least 34 of your party is there before being seating.  2nd, they do no split the checks and they said only a max of 5 cards per check, so if you are coming with a party, make sure to bring cash, and take in to account that tip & tax is per everyone in the party, not just what you order. The bill was sort of a cluster, but we got through it.  I came for breakfast, but when I heard what my son was ordering dangit I wanted it too, plate envy right off the bat. I ordered the machaca chimichanga with verde sauce. It was shredded beef, eggs, jalapenos, onions & tomatoes, I figured even though it was on the regular menu and not breakfast, the fact that it had egg in it made it ok.   The burrito was delish, the meat was tender and juicy the jalapenos fresh and vivid in color, the verde sauce was so good! Before I knew it the burrito was gone! It did come with a side of rice & beans as well.  Another great meal at Comedor Guadalajara, and fun time with the breakfast club!",

Service is always friendly and great. The menu is eclectic and large. The food is good. Beware though, unless you go on an off time the place is totally packed all the time. You will have to wait a little bit for  a table. I would suggest before 5pm on Friday nights and not on the weekends.",

I've tried plenty of things on the menu and oh my goodness it's delicious!!! Shredded beef tacos, red burritos, chicken burritos, Machaca, green Chile, chilequilez, their tortillas, soups, rice and beans, down to the chips and salsa! This place is just so dang good! I'm telling you. My family and I have been going for years and it just gets better and better every time! The wait gets a little ridiculous because it gets soooo packed but trust me that 2hr wait will definitely be worth it. Monday thru Friday if you go during lunch hour they also serve you a delicious soup while you wait for your food. (Just a heads up this place is crowded from the time it opens till the time it closes) YES! IT'S THAT GOOD! I promise you won't be disappointed! Comedor Guadalajara is seriously my favorite restaurant I'VE EVER BEEN TO! I'd give them 100 stars if",

For me, I opted for the chimichanga, enchilada style.  It was ok...my only negative, was the fact that, there were pieces of egg shell.  I would suggest that if you cook with eggs, make sure you are cautious & mindful of that.  Aside from that, it was very well seasoned and presented nicely.  As for service, unfortunately, that was only ok, as well.  Had to ask 2x for more salsa.  And one of the menus we received had salsa on the inside pages, the hostesses, really could use the spare time to make sure they stay wiped down between uses.  Again, the food is worth  coming for and the service issues are minor.",

Once we were seated, we were helped by a kind fellow named \"Israel\". He answered all questions and always came to the table with a smile. This I greatly appreciated.   I ordered the machaca. This was my first time eating this so I don't know where it compares to others but it was absolutely amazing.

Once at a table, I realized that the place is quiet spacious.  And the atmosphere was quiet for the amount of people that were seated. The waitress was friendly.  She was prompt with our drink orders and the chips and salsa.  My friend and I shared a hearty pot of lengua. It was just right after a late night of dancing. The prices are very reasonable. Comedor is by far, not a four or five-star facility,  but the food and service are topnotch! Keep doing what you do Comedor Guadalajara!",

    "text": "Ever since my wife and I first went here a couple of months ago, I've almost constantly craved the soups they serve. We've been back 5-6 times since then and can't get enough of anything they serve. Even the rice and beans are outstanding!.  The weekend only beef soup is probably my favorite but can only order on the weekends. The chicken soup is so rich and flavorful, I doubt I can ever truly enjoy anyone else's and the 7 mares seafood soup, well, that's in a class all it's own....hell, all of their soups are in a class all their own. One big downfall though, after eating here you're ready to collapse into a food coma....in a good way.  Everything we've tried has been outstanding except the carne asada. The carne was a bit thin and way over cooked. The pork carnitas were very good but a little overcooked also. However, all fish/seafood and chicken dishes have been amazing and have found Comedor Guadalajara definitely the most authentic Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area. I've tried most of the Mexican Restaurants and this has been the best overall. The typical 30-60 minute average wait during dining high times should give you a clue but look at who's eating here, families. Groups of 8-15+ in a party let alone us couples and smaller parties. When large families gather at a restaurant, you know it's got to be good!  Overall, pricing is very reasonable, and definitely an excellent value for the portion sizes offered. ENJOY!",

Do not expect to find any fancy dishes here, the food is what you may find at a comidas caseras type of place in Mexico. The Mexican food here has the tastes of Sonora and is full of flavor.  There have been two items that have been ordered that I really did not like. The chilaquiles during breakfast and fried fish for dinner. The fried fish was almost burned and super oily. The chilaquiles are smothered in sauce, which I had never seen. It must be a Sonora thing. You can not go wrong here if you order something that is grilled, whether it be tacos de carne asada, pollo asado, or a parrillada, etc. The enchiladas and chile rellenos are good, but again they are smothered in sauces which is not typical from the part of Mexico my family is from.  Bottom line, this restaurant serves good Mexican food, the portions are huge, and is inexpensive.",

I had a combination plate with enchiladas and tacos (if a place can't pull these two simple dishes off...this chica from NM is gonna go elsewhere) and they were both delicious.  Everyone at my table really enjoyed their food.    I can't wait to go back and try the albondigas soup which I've heard so much about.  I hear they also have a pretty good happy hour.

All of which I could live with, had the food been outstanding.  If you know me, you know I can eat. I don't leave food behind especially when it comes to my comfort food like beans and rice. Both came piping hot but lacked flavor! There was no soul in this food. The Machaca looked great with fresh jalapenos and tomato but yet again lacked seasoning. Sadly, I did not mop my plate clean with the very good flour tortilla that was served with my meal.  My husband's combo was as generic as they come.   Over priced with too long of a wait for what is essentially generic Mexican- American food that lost it's authentic soul somewhere along the way, so I don't suspect that the Chilaquiles would have saved this review!",

Food wise I had the lengua tacos it was really \"spicy\" not like hot spicy but like a lot fo different tastes in it. My boyfriend had oh I can't remember the burrito but it had chicken, peppers, and onion. i don't like peppers and onions but the green sauce that they had put on it was sooooo good. I wish I had got some green enchiladas or something.   Now correct me if I am wrong, why are there no Tamales? I couldn't find any? Do they not serve any or did I miss it somewhere?  That was my only complaint I went in looking for tamales but hey I got something better so I guess it's not really a complaint then huh?",

    "text": "The best Mexican food I've ever eaten. There was not 1 thing we ate that was not amazing.  If you are interested in an appetizer, get the Cheese Crisp. We got it with steak and jalapenos. it is about the size of a medium pizza.  It is good enough to eat as a meal if you are not sharing. Also the salsa that comes with the free chips is really spicy. I love spicy food and it made me grab a drink. It taste great, but dont grab a big scoop. I got the chicken burrito and the chicken was NOT soaked in that greasy seasoning like most place do. It was flavorful,  but not greasy. There is no other way to describe it beside saying it was really really good. The mango margarita is very tasty,  you can actually taste the mango flavoring. The dessert we had was the flan. I've eaten my share or flan and this is hands down the best flan I've even. It was different than any flan I've had at other restaurants. I will make sure I go out of my way to come here every time I visit. Don't like the outside fool you.  If you are coming from its back side, it looks like an run down warehouse. Once you get to front of the building it's nicer and the inside was nice and clean. So don't let the outside scare you away.",

I thought the sauce was good, but the meat itself was only ok. I was generally satisfied with my meal though. The service was very nice. Also, the portions are huuuuuge, so come hungry or be prepared to take some food home afterward.",

The chips and salsa are good.  The salsa has a nice touch of spice to it.  I could always use more, but it is hotter than most places.  We ordered a cheese crisp to start.  It is essentially a super thin pizza crust with a ton of cheese meleted over it.  I love thin crust pizza, and I love cheese even more, but it could use some seasoning or some kind of sauce.  For my meal I ordered the cheese enchilada lunch special.  The enchiladas were ok.  The sauce was very good.  The rice was ok.",

I ordered the molcajete de camaron which is a spicy shrimp hot soup in the stone bowl with nopales and cheese. It was delicious and very filling I took half home, to drink I got horchata because everyone recommended it to and it was good not the best I've had but good. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because they made a really big deal about not splitting checks or letting us pay with more than 3 cards. I understand we were a large group but we asked before hand to split and they said yes then when it came time to pay they said no so it was annoying having to do the collection rounds and needing to get cash out. Other than that it was a good time and we would definitely go back again!",
