I didn't think the line was too long and was surprised to find myself still in line 15 minutes later. Disappointed to see only carne asada or chicken choices. The tacos were a great size for a late night snack. I found the mini quesadillas to be too salty, although it did have a nice crisp.  The salsa roja had a nice spicy kick.  The horchata was too creamy and sweet. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back. But if I were in the area and had the nighttime munchies, it'd be better than a 24 hr fast food joint. Just be ok with waiting up to 45 minutes for some tacos.",

The asada was really bland with hardly any flavor at all.   Pretty tough to mess up asada in my opinion.  There were also a lot of pure fat pieces and then partially fatty pieces in our tacos.   It's like that was done on purpose.  There was hardly any guacamole in the tacos at all.   The hot sauce was really good, so there's one pro on the tacos.   The quesadilla was supposed to be a kids version with cheese only...   they gave us asada and lots of hot sauce on it.   Not biggie, just made our boy one at home.     Cooks were working diligently, there was plenty of staff for a food truck (7 employees inside truck) but the order still took 20 minutes, and there was no line when I ordered.     Another part that left a bad taste in my mouth, not literally, was a crazy guy on drugs or super drunk was asking customers that were waiting for food for money.   Some would politely say \"no\", or \"I don't have any money\".   And the crazy guy wouldn't stop asking, or he'd tell them \"I know you're lying, just give me some money\".   He had bugged out eyes and everyone he spoke too was very uncomfortable or scared.   You would think the staff would have asked him to leave.   Not a big deal or the restaurant's fault, just really annoying and creepy.    All and all, this was a total fail.   I had really high hopes because the reviews.   I only gave two stars because the kitchen staff was packed in and all of them were working with a sense of urgency.",

Hmmmm, 4 and a half stars, pics look tasty, and jam packed. It must be good, right?  WRONG!!!!  This place is awful. I mean really really awful. Nothing we ate tasted good.  We had a chicken quesadilla, a steak quesadilla, a bean/cheese burrito, and asada tacos. They all sucked. The asada was bland and dry.  No salt at all.  Just charred pieces of meat.  The chicken was flavorless. The tortillas were stale. The bean and cheese burrito was an absolute disaster.  Please see the picture i posted.  No, that is not a plate of beans we ordered on the side.  That came out of 1/2 a burrito.  Bland, flavorless beans and some cheese wrapped in a greasy, half-ass-wrapped tortilla.  And who puts minced cabbage on steak tacos? The only taco that should have cabbage on it, is a fish taco. And the cabbage should be shredded, not pulverized.  The red sauce was not spicy at all, and lacked any kind of authentic Mexican flavor.  No condiments anywhere.  No variety of sauces, no radishes, no pickled jalapenos & carrots.  They just throw a couple of dried up lime wedges in your plate.  I saw a few people with some roasted jalapenos on their plate, but you have to specifically ask for it.  Quite possibly the worst taco joint I've ever been to.  The people who gave this place 5 stars should really get out more often.  This place is garbage.  Try PHX Burrito House down the street.  Much, MUCH better.  But those f***ers close early.  Or, for the best tacos and burritos in all of Phoenix, head over to Ta Carbon on 43rd near Thomas or on 59th near Camelback.  By the way, I ate there at 10:30.  I'm writing this review at 11:30...from my toilet!",

Overall the prices are amazing but the wait was not really something I would want to do again. Especially battling another hidden line on the bar side of Charlie's. I'm more interested to go hang out there and make a new gbff & see what they have to offer! I did enjoy my combo plate though and the horchata did taste better once I had some spice in my mouth already.",

I suppose I went to all of the wrong places because I never found better Mexican food there then what I had experienced else where (compare \"Tortilleria Mexicana Los Hermanos\" in Brooklyn). Taqueria Los Yaquis was the exception. The food was excellent. Their tortillas were always hot, had a fresh flavor and tasted amazing. Their carne was salty, flavored well and well portioned. Their sauces are hot and very tasty! The line was cray sometimes but the food is worth it and that's why we waited time and time again. The pricing is just right and it's the ultimate in late night munchies. Sooooo gooood.",

They are a bit small, but they are good.... well prepared on a yummy tortilla with cabbage, guacamole and salsa. They also have nachos, burritos, and combo plates. Most things other than the tacos are either $4 or $7. Horchata is $2 for a 24oz cup and you do not get refills. They also have bottled drinks for $1 or $2 depending on the drink. (They probably make their money off the drinks because of the cheap tacos.) Also, they have a $5 minimum for card purchases as well as a 50 cent charge. Quick yummy and cheap tho only open at night.",

Note for those who are new or don't know how to properly order from a taco stand/food truck:   Always order a side of cebolla asada and jalapenos toreados. It definitely amplifies your meal with a tasty kick of heat and texture. You won't regret it.  Also their carne asada quesadillas are ridiculous for what you pay. It's a damn steal for the price.",

So, when the plane touched down we took our tired a$$ selves down here, finally after all these years. She won't stop raving about them. So, if you take the circuitous route to enjoy the Kentuck Derby - by all means hit this place up afterward. It's a godsend. Figure at least 3 tacos per person if you are unfamiliar with how tiny street tacos are. 6 if you're hungry!  There's not much cilantro (any?) but they have the guac on em so that works out okay. Its open til 4am on Fridays and Saturdays. The salsa isn't HOT until about taco two...it has a build up factor. We Parked at Charlie's. There are only like 5 spots available in front of the actual food truck, so plan on not parking at the location.",

    "text": "Well it took some time. My gf now hates this place. I would come with her because she didn't want to eat alone. I'm not a fan of these tacos.  They are a dollar for a reason.  They are small, meat sucks, no cilantro or onions which I rather have over cabbage or whatever it is. Last time we went my gf didn't finish her tacos. The \"carne asada\" look more like ground beef. The meat was really shredded. The meat lacks flavor, always has. I don't get how people rate this 5 stars but there are better taco places. This one is mediocre at best.   I wish they can get rid of the bums. Yes I get it they are homeless but trust me I have bought them tacos since they ask for food and not $. 3 of them approach me the other night. I told the lady if they can please tell them to go away. One of them reeked alcohol and the others smoke near by. I'm never coming here again",

Waiting in the heat feels like five minutes is twenty. Prices are cheap - four tacos and a horchata drink = $6.   We waited for ten minutes until our order was called. The Carne Asada and Chicken tacos had lots of filling, but lacked flavor. The horchata was good.  If you only got a couple of bucks to spare, and you need to have a hearty meal at one in the morning, this place will definitely offer you that!   I don't wish to come back because it's too damn hot, but maybe when it gets cooler and I'll try their other items.",

I got the carne asada tacos and it was so bland and just plain. The meat had no flavor. The corn tortillas were dry and  tasted like they just got warmed up in the microwave.  They must be popular because the location is right besides the bar and serves the bar outside and the food truck line on the opposite side.  Drunken tacos must be the ONLY reason for it   I ended up going home and eating",

    "text": "It's cool in the sense that you can get really cheap tacos (other items aren't worth it) really late at night, either while clubbing or on the way home. We don't have enough places after 2am that are accessible on foot, so Los Yaquis is gonna be in high demand.   My quesadilla was definitely small and bland for the $8, and nachos are just plain old nachos, like what you'd get at the movies or something. I will admit the meat tasted rather fresh, unlike other late-night spots, where it can sometimes sit around for hours.   Apparently, I was also fortunate enough to avoid really long lines. It was pretty busy around 11pm on a Sunday, but there's no way in hell they have the capacity to fulfill the 2am rush. What drunk person is gonna chill out by a trailer, with no restrooms in sight while waiting for their order? Who is gonna keep people in check when people are (and i saw this firsthand) dramatically yelling at each other, or beggars are accosting every table? I can live with all this, but there's no way in hell you're going to eat in peace, something I don't deduct any stars for because it's not a real restaurant (it's a food truck that never moves).  There are totally times in which this will be the only option, and it won't be a terrible one. But at the same time, I can't imagine any reason someone would go out of their way for just decent Mexican fare.",

It's a semi permanent truck sort of situation with some picnic tables outside of a bar. The husband and I shared the pollo mini quesadilla (2$) and the carne taco. The taco was just ok... nothing terribly special, but good for 1$. The quesadilla was really good... very flavorful, and I usually don't love chicken at taco shops, but this was good. I would come back for that. We also had the horchata.... this was not so good... too watery and too much cinnamon.... I couldn't even really drink it. Anyway, I think this place is good for the price, but I wouldn't be rushing back here for a taco.",

We ended up ordering way too much, but we were amazed how these small tacos tasted fantastic. It's definitely different from the LA tacos I usually get, they have minced cabbage instead of regular cilantro and onions. The freshness and quality of the meat was great, but it's the salsa that really stands out.   Whenever I'm in AZ, I'll have to stop by again!",

She's on the petite side, and puts herself together a little nicer than most girls around that part of town. The moment we connected though, I knew she was far from hollow. In fact, she was one of the most down-to-earth, simple, yet complex, ladies I've met in a long time who is filled to the brim with good things, and she's not the type of lady just looking for your money. When we kissed, time stopped, and in that moment I knew True bliss...and needed a napkin.  She's a mini quesadilla, and for $2, she's more than worth venturing to Yaquis, one of Phoenix's legit late-night grub spots, for. I always used to get the tacos, but this time I went with a gut feeling, and it paid off! No longer will I be held down by my self-bestowed shackles! No longer will I preach that the tacos are king, and that they're the only food that matters at Yaquis! For the sky opened up, and a divine thing occurred that beautiful night...I know now what I must do. I must shout it from the mountaintop! THE! MINI! QUESADILLAS! ARE! DELICIOUS!  So go already.",

All I wanted to do was come back, and I did -- the very next day. I love the taco asada! The meat is juicy and tender, with spice added from the salsa and slight crunchiness from the cabbage. And it's only $1! I like to ask for lime wedges to squeeze on my tacos to add a slight acidic taste. I also tried a quesadilla, but I felt like the taco was easier to eat (not so messy).   The horchata is also delicious and large, serving as perfect companion to those savory tacos with its sweet, slightly milky taste. And what a steal; 24 oz for only $2!   The line does get long sometimes, but it moves fairly quickly. Bear with it! The food is worth the wait.",

    "text": "Wow.   By FAR the best taqueria tacos that I have yet had in Phoenix!  Amazing find - I just ate there tonight and I am still dreaming of the delicate and perfectly cooked homemade tortillas used for the mini Carne Asada Quesdilla that I practically inhaled!.   I almost missed ordering these \"mini size\" Quesadilla bad boys but saw a plate of these delicate morsels at a nearby table and I added them to the taco order.  OMG were they good. Sorry to gush, but each bite was pure bliss.   Without a doubt - unequivocally - these are some of the best tacos and quesadillas that I have ever eaten.   The place is a kind of hole in the wall with a small parking lot up front. You know you are in for an amazing food experience by three dead giveaways:  1) The massively long and slow line out front on a Sunday night (at least 30 min before being able to order - worth every minute!). 2) The sight and sound  of the cooks freshly chopping away at the tender Carne Asada on the block continuously - no pre-made dried out beef here. This is the tender melt in your mouth Asada of your dreams  3) The happy people eating at the tables nearby  Prices here are dirt cheap - Only $1.00 per taco, and about $2.00 for each mini Quesadilla. Our family of 3 filled up our hungry tummies for less than $20 including drinks.  Tacos were superb with a bit of cabbage, some spicy and flavorful homemade red salsa and a dab of salsa style guac. The tortillas are fresh, and extremely tasty.   The only place I've ever had Taqueria tacos as good as this was in Mexico many years ago.   The opening hours of this place are a little strange right?    Open only Thursday through Sunday, mostly nights and late nights. No lunch possibility sadly. This must be related to opening at hours coinciding with the Charlie's bar just behind to feed the happily inebriated with some of the best munchies in the city lol.    Taqueria Los Yaquis is now on my radar as a standout for delicious cheap eats - one of Phoenix's True gems -  some of the best tacos that this town has to offer. Yes, the tacos are exceptional but don't miss the \"mini\" Carne Asada Quesadillas ($2.00 each) as they are the big O.",

The corn tortillas are so tasty and authentic. The salsa is yummy. All the ingredients were so fresh and flavorful. Will definitely go again. Kinda wish they were opened all week but why would they?

Guacamole is so creamy and the meat is very well marinated. It's pretty small so I usually get like 4-6 tacos depending on how hungry you are. I heard the burritos is also very good. Came here two times only and I already love it here. Will definitely come again. As for service, it wasn't anything special they were polite and just take orders. The wait is pretty long. Usually 10-15 minutes for your order.",

The burrito is more substantial than 5 tacos for same price, order it with a side of jalapenos and some extra salsa. The nachos are also good, I'll get those when not feeling the burrito, and again always with extra jalapenos. This spot is a real Phoenix staple in the world of tacos.  Sometimes, when you get here and there is a 45 minute long wait just to order, consider going inside the club, to order, they have a window inside Charlie's as well as walk up outside the club.  Come here, eat tacos (or burritos) and enjoy!",

    "text": "My roommates and I heard whispers of Taqueria Los Yaquis through the streets of Phoenix. Little did we know the beauty that is held between the tortillas. Our first night visiting the taco truck (lovingly nicknamed gay tacos because of its proximity to the gay bar it is located behind) was an life changing experience, to say the least. As the clock struck midnight our four stomachs started to crave the spicy goodness of Mexican cuisine. My roommate, Jordan noted the fact that we had yet to try out the taco truck our beloved friends had told us glorious tales of. The other three of us grunted in agreement at the idea and headed out on our quest.   We had a hard time finding parking since the bar is very popular most weekends, but we were finally able to locate a place to park. On the walk up to the truck we were met with a line of decent length, which both brought us dread, and anticipation. \"Cash only\" I noted, as I pointed to a sign ride near by. We all frantically reached for our wallets, worried that because of our college student lifestyle, would not be able to enjoy the food we so desperately craved.   To our delight we had just enough cash for us to enjoy a perfect amount of tacos and mini quesadillas, since they were only $1 and $2 a piece. We made our way slowly to the front of the line. \"Should we get this to go?\" I asked the group, noticing the small amount of seating at the establishment. Again, the roommates grunted their agreement as we all took a second to take in the sights.   The chefs could be seen through the window of the truck. We stared in awe at the amazing confidence of the individuals who did not look where their knife landed on the cutting board as they chopped up the meat for the meals they prepared. They looked as though they had channeled the ancient spirit of taco meet chopping, that we have all heard legends spoken of so often. The bar was hoppin', we noted, as we looked through the window that was meant to serve individuals inside the establishment. The look on the faces of the intoxicated individuals was that of pure joy as they received their delicious treasures.   As we ordered our food from the very generally delightful woman at the table, we were filled with a sense of doubt. Maybe the food wasn't that great. I mean $8 for four tacos and two mini quesadillas? How good could it really be?  As we received our pink bags filled with the styrofoam containers that held our treasures, we noticed a table of people leaving. \"QUICK SNAG THAT TABLE!\" Screamed my roommate Aaron as we rushed to stake claim.   We all opened our containers together and sank our teeth into the first bite. \"HOLY TITS!\" My third roommate (known to us as Jash) exclaimed. \"Good lord\" I remarked. \"Dddddaaaaammnnn\" replied my roommate Aaron. \"Mdksisha\" mumbled Jordan, as he did his best to convey the satisfaction the taste of the food brought to his mouth. We then proceeded to completely demolished the rest of the food. Noting the AMAZING flavor of the mini quesadillas and the almost overpowering but yet awe-inspiring spice of the harmless looking salsa.   After that night, our lives were changed forever. We visited the taco truck many more times that year. At least 2-3 sometimes 4 times a month (since it was only open Thursday's-Sunday's). We continued to visit Taqueria Los Yaquis until the day Aaron graduated college and Jash moved on to other adventures. Jordan and I continue the tradition of randomly turning to each other at 11-12 at night and asking the other, \"So are we going to gay tacos or what?\"  And yes we still love the establishment. And will sing tales of its glories till the end of our days. So if you're asking yourself, \"Is it worth it? The place looks kinda sketch.\" Know this, the best taco truck in all of Arizona, and quite possibly the world, is located behind Charlies Bar on West Camelback. And it's name is Taqueria Los Yaquis.",

The mini quesadillas are the best thing on the menu. Its a must try! The tacos are the best dollar tacos around. Here's a little hint for you. Don't try to park on the street. Park in Charlie's parking lot and walk around or just go inside Charlie's(Its a gay bar, don't be scared) and order from the window inside Charlie's back patio. It's WAY faster and you can get a beer from the bar.",

Come On!  Upside, inside out I'm hitting up a Taqueria I'll eat and drink some down, hitting up a Taqueria It's lines are crazy long and it's sauce is color Roja I will wait you it out hitting up a Taqueria....come on! Hitting up a Taqueria, come on! I'm hitting up a Taqueria.  Probably one of the best taco shops I've had in a long time especially in Phoenix.    Taqueria is a taco food truck parked right outside of a night club.  Overall, it's pretty darn tacky in my point of view, but damn does it work!  Lines here can get really crazy and long plus when it's summer time; it's just darn redonkulous!    Needless to say, it was worth it!  For only $1 a pop these tacos were amazingly good!  I ordered 5 Carne tacos which came with beef, onions, cilantro, and salsa.  Basic to the point, but that's how it should be!  Sprinkle some lime atop and let your palates sing.  I didn't even use the salsa that came along with it since I thought it was pretty tasty without it.  The corn tortillas was soft and warm wrapping the tender beef, while the onions provide a hint of crunch.  The cilantro was aromatic while the lime and salsa ended your final bite with a sour and spicy punch!    In the end, Taqueria is not located in the best spot in town, but it's definitely worth a visit at least once regardless. - Enjoy!",

I mainly go for the tacos and mini quesadilla which are both excellent. There isn't much of a variety & the chicken isn't great, but the carne asada is bomb. The burritos are decent as well!   My complaints would be the efficiency at which they operate. They have one person taking orders for the line outside and also for the line inside the neighboring connected bar. They are also stingy with giving out sauce. I would prefer they put my sauce on the side especially for the quesadillas so that they don't get drenched & soggy so quickly.   I'd recommend this place if you have a good amount of time to wait & don't mind eating outside at picnic tables!",

Trust me my tastebuds is singing to my brain. \"Buy more lol.\"  One of the many things I've learned:  ask the locals where they like to eat; or if looking for particular type of ethnic food, ask that particular ethnicity if you are able to. They usually will have the best recommendations.  I should know being half Korean & having a full Korean mom who makes amazing food plus. I have a tendency to be a little pickier when it comes to Korean food.   Now this is True when I was introduced to this little gem!!!  Thank you for this tip & sharing your large To Go order with me haha!!  I will definitely go out of my way to go back if I need a taco/quesadilla fix.

    "text": "I was craving some tacos (San Diego withdrawal symptoms) and had this place bookmared.  It was on the way home so I stopped.  The line was pretty deep and took about 15 minutes before I placed my order.  I ordered 2 pollo tacos, 3 carne asada tacos, one mini carne asada quesadilla and one mini pollo quesadilla.  Total for all that food was only $9.00!   Its $1.00 per taco and $2.00 per quesadilla. Here is how they were................  Pollo Taco-  This was my favorite of the bunch.  They have great tortillas and they top them with grilled chicken, guacamole, cabbage and hot sauce.  The cabbage threw me for a loop at first but it actually worked with these kind of tacos.  These tacos are super duper small....2 biters.  For a buck, they are fine.  Carne Asada Taco-  Same prep as the pollo.  The carne asada was flavored decent.  My tacos did have some gristle and fat in them.  They were fair.....compared to some spots in SD, nowhere close, but for Phoenix, they were decent.  Quesadillas-  These were topped the same way as the tacos but cheese and another tortilla was added.  Next time, I might just get cheese/meat.  The cabbage made these quesadillas worse.  Weird texture issues lol.    Service was friendly enough.  Price was good but I was not blown away.  TONS of people were coming and going though so its pretty popular and may be the best Phoenix has to offer.  If so, Ill accept it but Ill continue to dream of SD taco shops!  That's about it.  Nothing super positive to say, and nothing negative to say.  It was A-OK!",

    "text": "I'm having mixed feeling writing this review because I feel like I'm cheating on my favorite taco shop back home in San Francisco, but Los Yaquis deserves praise from the highest of mountains. Where do I begin??? Well I just moved here not too long ago and tried a few taco places here in the valley and haven't had any luck with good quality tacos. So many gringo tacos I almost gave up hope. But low and behold thanks to some referrals and instagram I've found this gem and I'm so happy I did. There was a bit of a wait but it was well worth it!! The tacos were so soft and the meat was so flavorful with the perfect amount of spices. I can proudly say these have been the best tacos I've ever had!! I will be a regular customer",

Because I stopped approaching this place with any airs of evaluation long long before I started consistently writing reviews on Yelp.  This place has the perfect food. It's delicious, unpretentious and super cheap. You can tell it's made by people that never went on a quest to make the world's most delicious tacos - it just happened because of the magic of family recipes. Like, it's street food, so if that's not your thing don't go. But, if what you want is to experience some delicious tacos and a slice of City life that is as endearing as it is confusing, go here and hang out any time between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m. If you go here and walk away unhappy, that's your problem.  Only heads up is that their hours are kind of wonky because they serve the late night crowd.",

    "text": "Some of the best street tacos I've had in Phoenix.   Went here for the first time. It's a trailer with a kitchen attached to a bar and several picnic tables set outdoors facing Camelback Ave. There was 10+ people ahead of me in line and it moved slow since the cashier alternates taking orders with another line formed inside the bar. But it was worth the wait.   I ordered a carne asada and chicken combination plate. It came with pinto beans, a generous serving of freshly chopped steak and chicken, a pile of grilled onions and a grilled jalapeno, with a choice of corn or flour tortillas to go with it.  I opted for corn. There was a stack of 6-7 of them and they were warmed and slightly crispy from the skillet. As I was handed my food, the woman in the trailer added the condiments over the meat with a ladle. It was good ! The tacos were hot and juicy with a delicious salsa over some cabbage with a touch of guacamole. The meat was well seasoned and high quality, like what you'd make in your own backyard grill. No nasty filiberto mystery meat here.   This is my new favorite steak/chicken taco spot. Too bad it's not open regular hours. And I was hoping to see al pastor. But the carna asada is legit and the chicken was surprisingly good too. I liked Yaquis pollo and carne asada tacos more than Atoyac's examples.",

Secondly, the nachos have that fake nacho cheese and round yellow chips, not anything remotely authentic or Mexican. The only okay thing was the meat. This was more like a cheap meal you would get at a theater; completely overpriced and shitty. I can see why it has late hours; only drunk people would classify this as a good meal.

Three bites and they are gone, but with \"everything\" on them, they are terrific, with great taste and texture. I prefer the Carne, but the Pollo is good as well. Wish they offered Pastor.  Quesadilla is to die for as well. Strange but I prefer Carne Tacos and Pollo Quesadilla. Can't explain that, maybe the cheese goes better with Pollo on the Quesadilla.  If you haven't, ask for the \"Onions and Peppers,\" a terrific treat as well.",

The stand in Tijuana offers guac, peppers and lime with their tacos. They are cheap and fabulous! A must visit every time I'm there. <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dtacos%2Bel%2Byaqui%2Btijuana%26ie%3DUTF-8%26oe%3DUTF-8%26hl%3Den-us%26client%3Dsafari&s=1fde182ce5d739c8b9176c461d65a248bf972ef9a44b339014ee31b598aec8d7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">google.com/search?q=taco...</a>  This place has a funky schedule. I live in Chandler so I had to make a special trip. Was in the area, but an hour before they opened (7:30 pm). Killed some time shopping, got back at 7:45 and they were open and ready for business. At least 30 people in line ahead of me, but because I had high expectations I waited. 30 mins. and I place my order. 3 Asada tacos and 3 pollo with everything. (Guac, cabbage and salsa according to the sign) My tacos were tortilla, cabbage and meat. Couple limes. I wouldn't have really cared much if it weren't for the girl who handed me my tacos. No hello, no thank you. Just a look of no value in the customer. I gave a tip when I ordered but because of her, I wanted it back. I spent 1 hours trying to get 6 street tacos. They were good but sparse considering the \"everything\" I ordered was meat and tacos and a grimace. I live near Chandler Fashion Sq., pass a lot of taco places... not worth the drive.",

The burritos are $5. There is an average length to longish line whenever I've visited. The staff is on it, they try to serve quickly and they are friendly. They serve 2 Windows. One for inside the Charlie's Bar and the other is outside the bar. They are open late so it's just the right fix for a late night snack. Just go already, I don't know what you're waiting for.

I usually order two tacos and one quesadilla, the tacos is made on a corn tortilla and the mini quesadilla is made on corn as well. If you get a regular size quesadilla it will be on a flour tortilla, so decide before you order. Don't forget to get limes and extra hot sauce because you can never have enough spice and lime on your taco.   The prices are amazing for the quality of food your getting (don't forget to bring cash) you can't go wrong with a $1 taco at 2AM.   Parking can suck at times but it's worth it!",

The prices most definitely can't be beat; I got 2 tacos, a mini carne asada quesadilla and water for $5. The carne asada was flavorful and the toppings just added to the flavors.   The location makes for some great people watching and the workers are friendly. If you're in the area it's a definite must-stop for some yummy Mexican favorites.",

Do they have adequate hand washing facilities?  One evening sometime ago I ignored my pre conceived ideas and gave them a shot.  The menu is small; tacos, nachos, burritos and I think maybe hotdogs and hamburgers.  What really caught my eye was the carne asada taco. Maybe one of the best tacos I have tasted and only one dollar each.  Be warned these are on the spicy hot side and I don't usually like spicy hot.  The flavor really is terrific and I quickly forget that my mouth is on fire.",

They meat is finely chopped up on top of a palm tree trunk which I am not sure if it give it a flavor to the meat but I think it does.

    "text": "4.5 stars? That's ridiculous. This place deserves 5 solid stars. Period. Don't argue with me. A friend of mine introduced me to this place about 3 or 4 months ago and I have since gone back an embarrassingly amount of times. Actually, fuck that. I'm not embarrassed, it's tasty as HAIL. Hands down, the best street tacos in AZ. Not even joking. Every single person I introduce to this place becomes just as obsessed as I do. I go about every other week at this point on Thursday or Sunday. I honestly do not order anything other than the $1 tacos. I have no doubt their other items are really amazing as well, but I have no desire to cram anything into my mouth other than those sweet, sweet tacos. I usually order a mix of carne asada, pollo and \"vegetarian\" tacos, which is just black beans. I have never once been disappointed. They do have weird hours and are located next to Charlie's, so if you go here during peak hours (i.e., when the club lets out at 2am), you'll will be faced with a very large line. Things can get a little slow when it's busy. But hey, these people are creating ART. So you shut your pie hole and wait in line. The lovely lady who runs the register is extremely sweet and is a damn pro at dealing with the drunk fashionable men and random hobos who stroll in off the street looking for a handout.  But really, you haven't had a legit taco in AZ unless you've been here. America's Taco Shop? Nah. Gallo Blanco? Puh-leez. Dig the loose change out of the bottom of your purse/car cup holder and hit this place up for a taco or 5.",

    "text": "The tacos at this place are little bundles of goodness that are damn near perfection. To begin the carne asada has great flavor with a slightly charred and crispy exterior, but still manages to maintain some tenderness on the inside. The cabbage, guacamole, and salsa are a necessary addition to this masterpiece of a taco. And just when you think you have it all... bam! Grilled onions complete one of the best tacos in Phoenix. On top of it all, these bad boys are only $1 a piece.   Now on to the less glamorous side of Taqueria Los Yaquis, or the underbelly if you will. The establishment is inconspicuously housed just west of 7th Ave on Camelback Rd under a tent with some plastic tables and sporadic misters outside of Charlies gay bar. Here you will find some flaming fairies and hordes of legit Mexicans flocking in from all angles. Once you reach your destination you can watch the cooks working tirelessly in a food truck (one of the cleanest I've seen) to prepare you meat-filled pockets of love. God bless them.   There are two ordering lines: one is literally a hole-in-the-wall inside Charlie's and the other a general line outside which accommodates all. This dual line and alternating order-taking results in ridiculously long waits of up to 20-30 minutes. I prefer to go on Sunday afternoons when it gets real, and a lil' less... uh... gay.",

These are what the world sees as the best what I see as the best are the lines of people waiting for what could be considered the best taco around.  I had just left a party moderately satisfied with the food or basically the food didn't suck.   Driving by I see the greatest Truck ever parked and serving. I see a short line I pull in,  the short wait of 45 minutes for the best taco ever. (And mini quesadilla).   The entire time they are cooking the Asada fresh consistently, salsa being made fresh consistently, meats being chopped so rapidly I wish I would've ordered more then 12 tacos.   I watch through the windows like a kid at FAO Schwarz in Christmas. Seeing the True chefs of America toss out an imperfect tortilla in anger because it will not make the taco cut.   I can only speak for two things on the menu.   1. The tacos- hands down the best!  meat is fresh and seasoned to perfection. Chopped to melt on your mouth. And it's a mystery how they are able to fit so much in a small tortilla.   2. The mini quesadilla, it's like two tacos opened up smashed together and bounded with cheese. This is heaven in every bite it's the best drug one can have great food.   I'm not sure how well this is going but I will say if you want the best taco go.  If you want to prove me wrong go and realize I'm still right.  Either way you will have a great meal at a great price.   So go have a James Beard, Michelin star worthy taco.",

The tacos are $1 and they are absolutely delicious! I would suggest if you are not opposed to eating beef that you order the carne asada tacos instead of the chicken ones (just because in my opinion they were a lot more flavorful). Pro tip: you can ask for grilled onions and peppers too! And beware if you don't do well with spice because the salsa that they put on top is pretty hot!

They do have odd hours of operation so make sure to call if you are unsure if they are open or not.   Food: They don't have too many protein options, but the carne asada is all you need! Quesadilla's, nachos, tacos, and burritos are all good. The red sauce is pretty spicy so if you can't tolerate too much spice, make sure to opt for no hot sauce.

The reason for 3 stars is the meat was a little gristly and not as tender as it looks. Still a good cheap spot for late night tacos! Probably will come back again.   PS: CASH ONLY!",

    "text": "Also known in the valley as \"Gay Tacos\". Hands down one of the best Mexican food I've ever had. Super cheap prices. The cost of cheap prices is that they ONLY TAKE CASH. Kinda inconvenient for people but it's worth driving to an ATM to withdrawal that cash. It's a food truck that parks right outside the gay club. What's cool is that they even have a window from inside the club connecting to the cashier area. The truck is kinda on the side of the light rail. So parking in front is very limited. Best to park in the Charlie's parking lot and walk over. They only open Thursday night-Sunday night. I think they close at 2am which is amazing for people who have the munchies. The line can sometimes be long and because they also take orders from the club so it takes longer. No taxes to anything. I usually order 4-5 of the Carne Asda Tacos. They are mini street tacos and each taco is a. $1. Spicy already comes on the taco so if you aren't a big fan of spicy make sure you tell them. It's pretty spicy too. Trust me I know. Doesn't come with grilled onions or lime either so make sure to ask when you order. They give you a ticket number and they call your number on the speaker intercom when it's ready. Make sure you listen because they tell you want window number to pick up the food. Can sometimes be too loud to hear. Usually has two windows. Has an outside dining tables. Best Mexican food in the valley!",

I have made many last minute trips just to get my taco and horchata fix.  I usually get 2 steak tacos, 2 chicken tacos and 1 mini chicken quesadilla, all of them with \"everything\" on them. The way they chop the steak on a wood block, roast fresh jalapeno and onions, the salsa is made of mystery magic. Everything is perfect.  It's hard find delicious fairly priced tacos. When you find them, never let them go.",

I'm knocking off a star because it took 35 minutes to get our tacos and when we asked for salsa they told me it would be 25 cents, I've been to at least a dozen taco stands and they have never told me salsa costs money.",

The con about the place is sometimes it gets full, they lose receipts and forget about it until you say something and that triggers people i know.. but please go when there isn't much people, always busy. In the recent order we purchased. It was a horrible experience, they lost our receipt and never got to our order until my boyfriend went up to ask, 45 mins later we finally got our food. Next time I want free food for being number 83 but the number was at 97..",

The tacos are $1 I got carne asada with with everything (salsa on the side because it's super spicy) and nachos with jalapeno and cheese. The flavors were on point! I saw them chopping the steak on wood and knew this place was the real deal. I love the fact that it's next to Charlie's because the crowd is just a great vibe I never feel like anyone is an angry drunk trying to start problems. Everyone just enjoying themselves! I got a Horchata which was a little sweeter than I usually prefer but that's just a subjective opinion. Definitely will be back again. I am on a mission to find taco trucks like D Street in Modesto, Ca. Those tacos' meats are marinated IN a sauce, come with cheese cilantro sour cream and onions and pickled carrots on the side. Mannn. If anyone knows where I can get this, let me know! Til then, this place gets an A!",

My friend Karen introduced me to this food truck (I usually don't do roach coaches...LOL) which is adjunct to Charlie's club on Camelback and 7th Ave. You'll meet a colorful cross selection of people from all over the valley. Some time the other customers are intoxicated beyond belief and act as such but, that doesn't take away from the good, fresh, flavorful food. There is not one thing that is bad on the menu and the prices are reasonable. Depending on how veracious your appetite, I'd start with 3 carne asada + 3 chicken tacos, fully dressed (double that is you can eat a lot).  The lines are long especially after 11pm and you may wait up to 10 minutes for your food but, it's well worth it. The music from Charlie's pipes through and is entertaining. My biggest complaint is the parking. They have only a few spots right there, or you have to park in Charlie's overly crowded parking lot because the city has put up new signs not allowing you to park in the nice sized adjacent lot (but they do all the time...thx Phoenix PD). Go check it out because they are there Thurs-Sun until 4am!",

I know you've probably stumbled upon yelp because people keep talking about this talking place but every time you attempt to come, there is a dizzying line of people already waiting.  Well you're reading the right review because I'm here to tell you, I am one of the most impatient people in the world but for these tacos, I will gladly wait. (which is exactly what I did last night for an hour, so worth it)  First off, they're dollar tacos. I repeat $1 DOLLAR TACOS.   Here are some things to remember when waiting here:  -The beef tacos are slightly better than the chicken, but just order both because they're a dollar. -You get onions and jalapenos FOR FREE but you have to let the lady you're ordering from know that you want them. - Get extra salsa if you're a spice fan like I am. Extra lime too! -You can't pay with card unless you spend at least 10 dollars (this rule may have changed) -Just buy 10 tacos, just do it. I promise you will eat all of them. -The taco truck is located right outside a gay bar which is why they are nicknamed \"gay tacos\".  -You will meet some interesting characters in this neck of town. Embrace it. -The horchata is good! No artificial flavoring.",

After a night out at Charlies, we discovered this place that is basically attached to the bar (which is an awesome concept).  Originally, I did not order anything because I was not that hungry, but after having a bite of my friends chicken burrito, I immediately changed my mind.  Normally, burritos that you get from food trucks are a lot of beans and rice with some chunks of chicken mixed in. However, the burritos from this place are around 95% meat, which provides for a very filling and tasty meal.  Overall, I was very shocked at the great seasoning and flavorful taste of the food here and would definitely recommend it, drunk or otherwise.",

    "text": "You can't imagine how delighted I am to find such a place in Arizona! My friends and I have resorted to fast food late night meals after a night of going out and that's just depressing.   The truck is located right outside Charlie's gay bar on the corner of Camelback and Florence, right before you hit Florence. You will see the sign for Charlie's first so just pull into their parking lot. The club was bumpin that night so the lot was full but the taco stand had almost no line Sunday at 11pm. Even though there were security guards by the club and my friend was a guy, I still felt a little nervous because there were definitely some shady looking people hanging out nearby. So if you're a chick make sure to go with a group. Don't let this deter you from going though, as we sat and ate there were plenty of groups coming by (couples, college kids, high school kids) so I felt more at ease.   As for the food, I was craving  a hot dog but I obviously wanted the tacos. Solution= I got both (sorryimafatty). Skip on the hot dog unless you're really craving it, its just a grilled ball park dog and I prefer mine all beef. Came with a side of Doritos which I gave to my friend.   TACOS HOWEVER were delicious! I got mine with all the toppings; the red sauce they put on there is spicy! It burned but that roasted red chili pepper taste is so good. I got the pollo and asada.. both were good but I definitely preferred the flavor of the asada more. My friend got the Asada burrito and devoured it! Burrito had the same toppings as the tacos: red sauce, guac, cabbage and onions. Also ordered a Horchata which was meh: watered down, gritty, and not very sweet or cinnamon-y .   Prices are more than reasonable, service is very friendly and food is excellent! They're only open Thursday to Sunday nights, I will for sure be back. Maybe I'll check out the bar this time too ;)",

It was so good I went here twice during my visit to Phoenix. I tried the carne asada tacos, super nachos with asada, mini quesadilla with chicken and another one with carne asada. I think the quesadilla tastes best with asada.   If you love authentic Mexican food, you must try Taqueria Los Yaquis!",

Their cheese quesadilla has 4 times the cheese you normally get and at 4 bucks is a steal. They have other food, including hot dogs and hamburgers for your more boring friends, though I fell in love with the tacos and cheese quesadilla and haven't looked back. It's become my late night go-to joint. Be prepared for LONG lines lasting 20+ minutes just to order, then another 10-15 minute wait during peak time (after 2 am when the bars close). There are definitely some out there people who stop by too. If you've got issues with the LGBT segment of society, then you might want to skip it.",

    "text": "This is my go-to taco spot on the weekends, even though it's so far from my house. The carne asada is where it's at. Praise the taco gods for reasonably sized $1 street tacos -- and honestly, these are a lot tastier than whatever prissy $4 taco you could get at Joyride or some other such trendy joint. These are the real deal. The truck is amazing actually; it's a bonafide industrial kitchen in that thing. The outdoor eating area isn't fancy, but the food is so good, you won't even care. I always get a few asada tacos and occasionally a $2 mini quesadilla (because cheese). And they're open late! Hashtag blessingsonblessingsonblessings.  *Pro tip #1: You can ask for grilled onions and they give you a pretty sizable plate. Can't remember if it's free or an extra $1, but either way it's worth it if you like onions. *Pro tip #2: Their bottled sodas are a little small for my soda loving husband. We usually stop at a gas station for route 44s before heading over for tacos. *Pro tip #3: The truck/bar is only a mile or so away from Churn, so there's that...",

I also got a side order of rice. Rice was pretty good as well.   6 tacos, side of rice and a dr. Pepper $12. Not too bad for a good lunch that fills you up.  Would definitely come back when in town.",

It's a very busy place we were here Thursday night around 12am and the line was to the street and we got our food ate and the line never stopped. The weekend I heard is even worse. Everyone loud, drunk, and just hungry for some good tacos. I call them gay tacos because everyone's happy and eating tacos or whatever else they want to order. The line wasn't really that long if you have some company with you to talk. The prices are amazing 1 taco is 1$ so I got ten with some horchata which was amazing! I paid about 13$ but I was hungry and I can eat so I can't complain on that. This play is just an amazing place to go if you're drunk or have a couple of friends and want some Gay tacos! Love it I will be back 100%!",
