She was super nice, kind, patient, and even brought me iced tea to go at the end of our meal.  We had the VIP MAC & cheese, a yummy pizza (pear & goat cheese), Moscow mule, and berry cobbler for dessert.  It was all very good. I did feel it was a little overpriced, which is why I chose 4 stars instead of 5. However overall this experience was fantastic. Definitely a place you can host a party too - their patio is beautiful.",

Wonder if it will hurt business in the summer.   Amazing beer and cocktail menu. They had a great blueberry beer which was dynamite. Food menu has TONS of options.   We did the truffle fries and brussel sprouts. Both were raved about with the entire table.   I had the cheese pizza and it was overall pretty good but not great. Didnt have much taste so needed some salt, olive oil and red pepper. That got it going!   Cant wait to come back",

I can't quite put my finger on it but here's some pros and cons-  Pros- Service- you can tell they are trying reallllly hard to impress customers and deliver a good experience  Patio/ bar area- great place to sit and have a bottle of wine and app, can see this place getting busy during the spring for patio season.  Cons- Way over priced- I have a hard time paying 20 bucks for a pizza that's just \"ok\" when I can drive over to LGO and get one cheaper that's way better. Food- nothing on the menu we ate was stellar or even worth going back for. Very bland and just overall not good.",

We sat for 10 minutes and no server greeting us. When one finally helped a table near, we asked if she was our server. She stated she \"could be\", I'll be back but never came back. Then after 15 minutes with no greeting, no water served, the hostess came out and informed us they had a reservation at 445 and we will have to move if we plan on being here this late. I replied that we would be gone way before that if someone served us and asked if he would take our order. He stated that he would get our waitress. We waited another 5 minutes and left. They didn't seemed to be short staffed nor busy. Menu looked awesome but can't comment on quality. Will not be returning.",

It's cozy hipster dark inside. Modern rustic....the garage doors at the bar are always nice so you feel like you're outside even when you're not. Speaking of....they have a great looking patio. Dog friendly. We ordered a Shroom pizza. It was plenty large enough for two people. It came super loaded with flavorful, earthy mushrooms. The crust was thin and crispy. It was super tasty.  There are numerous menu items....from apps and pizza to burgers and seafood entrees. A handful of vegetarian options are scattered throughout. But our server said some meat heavy options could be modified. Our server was really attentive and informative, considering this to be our first visit. I'm not a great writer so I'll close by saying we really enjoyed this place!",

    "text": "I was really excited to try this place and I'm looking forward to another try to see if the service will be more consistent, and to try other items on the intriguing menu. The servers other than the PHENOMAL Cooper, the up and coming Brianna and Miguel really need a lot of training. This includes the hostess and even one of the managers.   The good: decor and atmosphere. Probably the best patio atmosphere I've come across. The menu variety is great. I tried an appetizer combo of roasted Brussels sprouts and creamy cauliflower. The veggies were not great, but the sauces were fantastic. Others in my party loved the crab cakes, the cheeseburger and the onion rings.   The bad: The service, aside from the three superstars mentioned above. A craft cocktail tasted like there was either no or barely any alcohol. I took a few sips and asked the waitress if I could exchange it for a glass of wine. She said she would talk to the manager and brought me the wine. When the bill came, both drinks were on there! When I asked about this, she said the manager said I would have to pay for the drink I didn't like. I asked to speak to the manager, and his response was that it would still cost the restaurant so they had to charge me. He insisted I drank way more than I did. My friend who sat next to me verified I took a few sips and he relented. That's a manager who is pretty short sighted over what would probably cost them about $2.   About half of our party had Cooper and their food came out much faster than everyone else's. She had great answers to first timer's questions. Just a night and day experience from the other half of us. Soup, which is obviously ready to serve took a good 20 minutes to come out, and just 2 minutes before entrees.  Some of us stayed after dinner and split a bottle of wine and had great service from Brianna and Miguel. They are new servers but they understand how to give customers a great experience.  I hope to revise my rating to 5 stars after another visit because the potential for this place is great. If they are willing to listen to feedback they should be very successful.",

    "text": "Pitch is located in a great location and has a nice open layout that looks inviting.  In practice it doesn't work out so well most times of the year in a place like Arizona...either far too hot or cold.  To start with there is entirely too much staff.  Falling over one another.    Each time we get the server spiel of the specials.  There are so many that I stop listening after the 3rd one.  No one wants to hear 6 specials....how is that 'special'?    The food is OK.  Nothing special, nothing awful.  The only food quality complaint was a soggy pizza which seemed to be from toppings that probably weren't dried after rinsing prior to being placed on the pizza.  The showstopper problem for us is that the food is delivered at random.  We were told it would be delivered when ready, but it's a bit ridiculous when 4 of us ordered a pasta dish and 2 pizzas which were delivered one at a time and only after the previous was consumed.  It took nearly an hour to get all of our food.    It was this way each time we've tried Pitch.  There either isn't an expediter or anyone in charge of the kitchen.  Each time the waitress disappeared after the order was taken.  And each time the manager came to applogize that they were training new people.  2 of 3 times we we're given coupons for breakfast or lunch.  I was out of town and left my easy going septugenarian parents with the coupons.  When I returned, my mother asked what I was thinking sending her there.  She described the omlete as something that tasted like it was cooked the night before, frozen and thawed out by running it through a dishwasher.  It was so off putting she called upon returning home to let the manager know of the quality of what is being delivered to the customers.  The manager told her she didn't know what she was talking about and hung up on her.  My family had been in the restaurant and catering business for a combined 110+ years serving high end clientielle.  We know our craft and rarely complain.    We just vote with our pocketbooks.    Pitch has a chance to turn it around, there is a good core. However, I think this place will be mismanaged out of business.  There is a ton of competition in South Scottsdale and near by Phoenix.  Nearly all are better bang for your buck.",

After that, sad to say it didn't get better. The pizza is subpar. I ordered a Margherita pizza, which should have lots of flavor, but the only thing I could taste was the basil. Bland, flavorless sauce, and the crust was overly dense to the point where it almost felt stale. My brother asked the bartender what the restaurant's specialty was, and he just said, \"All of it, everything on the menu is the best.\" No. Wrong. Is that really how the staff has been trained to answer a question like that? First, it offers no guidance whatsoever on what to order. Second, a specialty cannot be \"everything.\" If that's the real answer, it's a bad one, considering the pizza was so underwhelming. If nothing is more special than that, I have no reason or desire to go back. There are other places in the area doing similar food much better.",

The premises were clean, well-lit with maintained restrooms. The waitress was a little distracted, not super engaging but it might have just been an off night for her.",

    "text": "Great for groups, not great for date night.   We were excited to check out this new restaurant in our hood, got a babysitter and did a date night here. I'll start with the positives and work down from there...  ATMOSPHERE: the view is great. Classy and contemporary decor. Mostly patio, which was chilly despite heaters (and asking for them to be turned on) on a January evening. Tables are mostly huge tables therefore not very intimate. We sat at a hightop that was cold and hard and could've fit 12.   FOOD: was good, but not like $22 a pizza good. We got the $19 tres peps and it was basically a pepperoni pizza with a cold jar of pepperonichinis and jalapenos on top. Like, the toppings were not baked in. Oh also served on a plastic plate. In my opinion Phoenix is a pizza Mecca, and you can just find better pizza elsewhere for cheaper. I wouldn't say it was bad, just unimpressive, especially given the price or that it's in an obscure location.    SERVICE: now, this place is new so I'll give em grace for still working out the kinks. Our waiter was awkward and clearly upselling everything and talked to us for far too long about cars (we aren't car people). They have daily specials which took way too long to explain. This would've gone over better on a paper menu. The manager came to check on us once and got way too close for comfort and touched me while I was eating which wAs weird (I know I'm not a dog but who likes that??).   Overall, I'm not dying to return given its expensive, quirky service, and uncomfortable seating. If my boss insisted on going her I would play along, at least the food isn't terrible.",

It was something recommended by the staff as being known to be really good, that and the pizzas... On another note, the artichoke was good!",

They really worked out the issues from my first visit, I would've given them two stars because I felt the food was unimpressive and inedible but the service was good.   Tried it again because of the awesome dog friendly patio. I was pleasantly surprised this go around. The service again was awesome, very friendly staff and attentive. On this visit I tried the calamari appetizer, along with the Margherita pizza. I'm pretty elitist about Margherita pizza. I must say their Margherita pizza is the second best I've tried in the area (second to LGO).

There are several issues, however, that need to be ironed out if it expects to have any staying power.  Among them:  - Pretty awkward layout.  You will circle the building before you realize that you have to walk through the patio to get to a table.   - Pretty dismissive and unhelpful staff.  The process for ordering takeout, for example, is a haphazard affair.  Hopefully this gets ironed out over time. - Pizza was beyond average.  The crust was dense and hard and the pancetta was the saltiest I've ever experienced.  There are too many better options in the area.  We'll be back to try a few more things on the menu and give the place another shot.  Hopefully my experience was the exception.  It would be nice to have a regular neighborhood spot but there are far too many options in the area to tolerate average.",

Sliders were yummy but messy because of the sauce art but you can wash your hands. Cocktails are on point as well, wish the happy hour was 30-60 minutes longer but whatever. Tad pricy but no worse than other spots in Scottsdale and better than a decent amount to be fair.   All in all, happy camper.",

He proceeds to say \"it's only been 16 minutes\" (so now they're arguing with customers?)

For my birthday we started off with drinks from their extensive drink list.We ordered San Tan Hefervizen Beer,couple of Pitch mules and a 1/2 price bottle of wine.All delish.For starters we had artichokes,beet salad, wedge salad and meatballs. All delish.We then had a couple of pizzas and burgers.Again delish.We shared and everybody loved everything.They gave me a fantastic tiramisu on the house with a candle for my birthday dessert.I have been back several times and have enjoyed their HH both inside and out.Had the hot wings,mashed cauliflower and roasted Brussels sprouts.We will keep trying new items but I must say the meatballs are the bomb !!

I decided to go big and order the crab cakes. What a mistake. The salads came out and they looked beautiful! I had immediate regret with my order. My crab cakes (2 of them) were delivered, they were burnt on one side and were sitting atop a mound of lukewarm mealy mushroom risotto and around the plate was a strange orange sauce that unfortunately tasted like Velveeta that immediately congealed and developed a skin. Very disappointing. I should have stuck with a $13 great salad instead of very disappointing $25 crab cakes. Order anything else, but not the crab cakes. Otherwise we had a good time, very good wine prices.",

Our server, Miguel, was extremely friendly with a wonderful smile and had a great knowledge of the specials they were offering. The food was by far the best part though. I got a Pork Belly Sandwich and my friend got the Basil Pesto Chicken Pie. My Pork Belly Sandwich was perfectly cooked and seasoned with two eggs on top and a delicious pickled cabbage underneath. My friends Pizza tasted amazing (I stole a bite or two). The crust was probably the best I've ever had. If you are looking for great food and an extremely friendly ambiance, this is definitely the place for you. I would give it 10 stars if I could. It's hard to find good food with a friendly atmosphere. Thank you Pitch for the great food and the wonderful staff you've hired. Will definitely be back for more yummy food!!",

The rest of my group had everything from pizza to salad and breakfast burritos and were happy with every selection.  Highly recommend giving Pitch a try. I will be back for sure!",

The ambiance was great, loved the patio. The service was slow. Took 5-10 min for our server to greet us. Took another 10 min to get our first drink, which 20 min seems excessive to wait for a drink from seating. Had to flag down our waitress to take our food order 15 min later. Just assuming they're still working out their service kinks. But we would totally go again...and soon.",

I admit the Avocado Toast with poached egg was supreme, but I didn't enjoy it with the loud music (Why do they do that?) and the flies bothering me. Probably won't go back.",

The place is gorgeous modern, with easy parking and bike racks right in front, a huge dog friendly patio graced with mature trees and a view of the Papago Buttes. The couple next to us were enjoying the Short Ribs Grilled Cheese sandwich and a delicious looking salad. More promising menu options, including gluten free, and the friendly staff and owner topped off the experience. A new favorite South Scottsdale haunt.",

    "text": "One of the \"operators\" named Brian verbally abused a kitchen employee in front of us on Sunday morning (11/12/17). We have no information on whether or not the employee was doing anything wrong. He simply seemed to be leaving with a pizza box. But, the point here is that Brian found it perfectly acceptable to berate another human, in public, in a VERY menacing way. Brian then proceeded to stalk that employee as he left, following him through the restaurant to the parking lot. We found it unnerving and scary that an owner of a restaurant thought nothing of taking his anger out in full view of his patrons. We observed him for the rest of our meal hulking around the restaurant speaking with little regard to other employees. We can't imagine that he'll keep people employed there for very long. I asked to speak to Dean, the owner, who was not available. Instead, the server whom I asked to send me Dean sent me Brian whom I declined to speak with and said I would call Dean. My unwillingness to disclose the reason for wanting to speak to Dean visibly angered Brian and he would not stop asking me what my problem was, and I continued to respond that I would call Dean. He walked away stating that I was \"unbelievable.\" As for the food, they apparently have a policy that it is served when hot. So, my partner's meal came five minutes before mine. We asked them many questions about the menu and the answer to most everything was no. The food was simply mediocre and not worth the trouble. Too bad because Scottsdale needs good restaurants, not just a collection of bars. A poor start for this new enterprise and I can say with certainty that we will not return.",

    "text": "My wife and I went out last night to check out a place that open up by us called Pitch. There are a lot of people there and everybody look like they were having a good time. It was our first time there and we were just kind of curious cuz we live about 2 blocks away. We were greeted by friendly staff and we told them we just wanted to have a couple of drinks and just check the place out. We opted to sit at the bar as most of the people there were sitting at tables and enjoying the meal. One of the owners named Dean came up greeted us, and asked us if we'd like to try some of their wine. The service there is fantastic. These guys really know their wines and their cocktail menu is amazing. Betsy and I split a bottle of Stella Rosa. It was delicious. They have some different prices for different options for their wines. But I can tell the people at this restaurant really care about their customers. A couple joined us at the bar. They were greeted with the same courtesy and care as we were. They ordered some food and as they were enjoying their meal they raved about about how good the food was. We plan on going back for the food as their menu look really good and it wasn't the typical crappy fair that you see in the older Old Town Scottsdale restaurants. I like the ambience of the place open air patio little fireplace it just seems like a family-friendly place. We're going to take the kids there to check out the food and see what the kids say. So consider this part one of my review but as far as I'm concerned what I saw last night this place is a huge benefit to our little southwest corner of South Scottsdale. And just a heads up to Dean thank you very much for helping us we're not wine connoisseurs but your patience and helping us with our selection and your expertise was greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "My friend and I walked up to Pitch from our nearby neighborhood for lunch today and we both thought it was excellent. We sat inside, which was tastefully decorated and the music in the background wasn't too loud. They have a great dog-friendly outdoor patio (with heaters) and a corn hole game nearby. One reviewer complained that it wasn't good for date night because the tables were all large tables, not smaller more intimate seating arrangements. On the patio they do have couches and small tables that would serve, and inside there are several smaller tables.  As to the food, the grill-roasted artichoke appetizer with hummus and tomatoes was surprisingly flavorful and the serving size certainly was enough for 2. I had the beet salad, which was large and boasted a broad variety of greens, thinly sliced beets and goat cheese. The topper of a phillo dough \"roll\" filled with goat cheese would have made me happy all by itself. (Hey, chef -- how about an entire plate of those as an appetizer???)  My friend had a burger with sauteed mushrooms and cheddar and said it was delicious and very filling. The side salad had a similar variety of greens but also included garbanzo beans, which was a nice touch. She asked for her burger cooked medium and it came back cooked exactly that.   Our server (Cooper) was personable and knew her way around the menu. (I never remember my server's name after I leave a restaurant, sadly. But Cooper -- I'll remember.) Pitch is not inexpensive, but the food sure seemed worth it to me. We didn't try pizza or sandwiches this time, but we'll be back to experiment more. As a footnote, I told Cooper that I was going alcohol free for Lent but wanted something non-alcoholic but more interesting than soda. I got a cranberry juice and seltzer. Other places I've been have charged $4.50 just for seltzer water. Pitch rang up my drink as a coke and charged me $2. Much appreciated! Good luck, Pitch. So glad to have you in the neighborhood.",

My father-in-law ordered a Cabernet and I had one of the local beers; both great choices. We had the spaghetti and meatballs as one entry and house-made pappardelle. Both meals were delicious! Sauces were fresh, pasta was amazing, and portions were generous. I'm excited to come back and try more from their menu. The only downside was the service; after being received promptly and making great menu suggestions; our server evaporated; this was especially noticeable because at the early hour there were only two other tables with patrons. At one point I went to the kitchen to ask for something and they called the server over. Like I said, it started out fantastically but ended up forgettable service-wise. I'm going to assume we caught someone on a bad night and we'll be back to try it again.",

Our food came out staggered as promised by the pasta items were ready before a simple chop salad. Seems like it should be the other way around. Food was hot and tasty.

We started with truffle fries and of course got all of the sauces; ketchup, lemon garlic aioli, roasted cherry pepper, and a pesto aioli. My favorites were the pesto and lemon garlic. Then we recieved the  roasted brussels sprouts, super awesome flavor and well cooked. I had to try my two favorite aiolis and would recommend putting the pesto aioli on the brussels sprouts. As we entered the main course we got rigatoni scampi, one of the best pasta' s I have had at a restaurant. Finally the main event, our pizza,  Mia with egg overeasy on top. So good, a top 10 gourmet pizza for sure",

The waitress handled it great, took it away and offered to replace it with something else. The bald manager came by with a bad attitude asked what was wrong with it and made a snide remark about getting what we ordered.  Apparently it's not enough to just not like something to send it back :/",

I ordered the Meatball sand and asked for extra sauce ; the tiny portion I received w / the meal was clearly inadequate, so I asked for more. Got a larger than necessary bowlful, and was charged an additional $3 ....also asked for a little more salad dressing ( the small dollop of a large portion of greens also initially inadequate )...this, too resulted in a charge of $.50.  It seem to me that  a nickle & dime approach to customers can't possibly be a desired business model. The food is usually good, but Pitch mgmt. seems to serve what they want and not what the customer would like.  We'd like to return when some changes are made.",

    "text": "This is a new pizza, burger, salad place that just opened up in a renovated office park.  The redevelopment of this property along a less than memorable stretch of Thomas Rd is very well done and creative.  Pitch has a big front patio, indoor/outdoor bar and large indoor seating.  It has that modern industrial design that's popular these days.  I sat at the bar and had a pizza and iced tea.  The Mia pizza comes with mozzarella, fennel sausage and pepperoni.  The flavors of the ingredients were very good.  I thought the pizza seemed a little greasy when it came out and the leftovers that I had the next day really kinda solidified into a clump when I reheated it up in the oven.  I'd probably try something other than the pizza the next time.  I'm also not a huge fan of their logo glassware.  It's a relatively small size and when I needed a refill on my iced tea the bartender had to go all the way to the back of the restaurant and into the kitchen, I suppose, to bring me a refill.  That's not ideal for him or for the customer.  Overall, it's a nice enough place if you're in the area.",

It's a very nice restaurant. The only thing I can complain about is it's not two dollar signs expensive. It's a lot more expensive than that. $21 13 inch pizzas, $40 steaks, and $26 plates of pasta. It was really good and I'll go again but I won't go expecting to leave under $50 if you plan on a beer or two. The food is terrific though...",

    "text": "Our new favorite restaurant! A place that's great for families AND happy hour is hard to find. From my 9 year old's perspective, the meatballs were amazing ( I confirmed that they were!). And he asked for more of the house made focaccia that came on the side. But the most important question for him was \"what kind of fries for you have?\".  The answer was, skinny, crispy and salty- dreams do come True!  Besides stealing bites of the meatballs and fries, the grown-ups also tried the chicken basil pizza, which was awesome. Crust is on the thin side with a chewy edge. My husband didn't like the big chunks of tomato on the pizza, but I did. You can't please everyone, right? He still loved the pizza. The slight miss was the charcuterie board from happy hour. Kind of skimpy, not too exciting.  But True to form, my favorite thing was a cocktail, the French mule. Made with green chartreuse liqueur, my favorite old school cocktail ingredient. Complex flavor and packs a punch!  We also had great service, and the restaurant itself is beautiful. There's also a big patio! We'll definitely be back.",

Once the burger came out the waiter told us it would be a couple more minutes for the pizza (which is fine). 15 minutes passed, the waiter came over to say they had to remake the pizza because they burned it. My boyfriends brother already finished his meal by the time we got our pizza. I wish they could've given us a discount on our bill or a glass of wine to make up for it. They didn't do anything which irritated us the most. We ended up taking the pizza to go and ate it in the car because we had somewhere to be.",

My girlfriend on the other hand did not like her entree (lobster mac & cheese) and said the lobster didn't taste fresh. No big deal right? Happens all the time. We didn't want anything in exchange just expected the entree to be taken off the bill like is industry practice. We wave down Brian and ask him what the deal was as my gf ate MAYBE 5 total bites of her ($26) mac & cheese. This is where the issue REALLY starts as Brian is a total prick and condescending when talking to my gf and says 'why should I pay for it just because \"you didn't like it\"'. Total sleezeball move by a middle manager of a \"high class establishment\" lol maybe learn how to work in a customer service industry.  Absolutely no chance we'll ever return.",

The fruit cobbler which looked great was also just average. Nothing about the food here would make me want to go out of my way to come back!

The menu had a lot more variety than I expected.  Started off with the HH meatballs. Very good, and large for a HH portion.  Then we ordered the roasted Brussels sprouts with spicy pistachios and a pesto chicken pizza. Everything was fabulous!  Admittedly, I probably won't venture much deeper into the pizza portion of their menu. As their main dish and appetizer menu had a lot of things I'd rather try first.   Service was great and the food came out quick (almost to quick).  Very cool trendy establishment.",

We took a while to make up our mind to order everything, but our waitress was attentive and answered our multiple questions since it was our first time in. Loved the vibe and layout of the place. Seems great for large groups, small groups, couples, families, etc.   We ordered pizzas and a couple of sides. One of the pizzas had gotten burnt so it took a few extra minutes for all of the food to be in the table. They were very apologetic though and made sure the pizza was done right and came quickly behind everything else.   Would love to go back again! Curious what their brunch is like... mmmmm",

She loves the outdoor tables, seeing other diners's dogs, and real food on the kids' menu. We got the best waiter we've met there, Lucas, who is usually behind the bar. He performed a great balancing act: first tending to my granddaughter's preferences and helping me convince her that the Brussels Sprouts appetizer is \"power food,\" then rustling up her favorite Root Beer, which was off the menu,  before her spaghetti arrived. In the meantime, he suggested a great salad for me with fresh roasted artichoke hearts, arugula, etc. with the inspired  addition of white anchovies. Lucas also knows his wine: I ordered a glass of white Caymus Corundum, a consistently excellent Napa blend. Later, I was curious about the CA wines with the PITCH label, and Lucas accurately described the grapefruity, dry, minerally sauv. blanc. Also Lucas never failed to engage my eight-yr-old granddaughter. Despite his tempting descriptions of various desserts, she was full. Lucas and I had exchanged mention of our favorite tequilas. When he promptly brought the check and our to-go pkgs., he brought me a taste of El Espolon from Jalisco, which I had never heard of -- and its easy to remember Dia de Los Muertos  inspired label. Quite good, along with Lucas' other suggestions.",

    "text": "On my forth visit to Pitch....  We keep returning to Pitch simply because most of the food is very flavorful, the bar is spot on, and the floor staff is generally top notch.  But (there has to be a \"but\" to keep it from 5-stars) the kitchen is plagued by poor timing of the food orders.  The waitstaff repeat the mantra that they \"bring the food when it's the freshest and hottest to showcase the food.\"  In my experience, that is cover for an inexperienced head chef.  However, I cannot take any credit away from the creative dishes that are routinely delicious...even though it seems I am the last to get served and last to finish with any group I bring to Pitch.  Navigate the menu with some care.  As the name implies, Pitch is showcasing a coal-fired oven (any baseball references are conveniently coincidental).  To that end, they excel at the items utilizing the oven.  The duck is spectacular as is the pork chop.  The thin-crust pizzas are cravable in their own right, even in a town with no shortage of great artisan pizzerias.  The fired artichoke appetizer is very well executed (albeit, at times a bit over dressed so ask for the dressing on the side).  Pastas are a standard fare and likely won't be the item to dazzle you but certainly will leave you satisfied.  Go to Pitch for the incredibly fun atmosphere and coal fired fare.  As I said in a previous review of Pitch, I wish they would open up another restaurant closer to my home in North Scottsdale; perhaps \"Catch.\"",

    "text": "No doubt, the food is good. You won't be disappointed as long as you don't make modifications. It's not the cheapest lunch but if you're willing to splurge a titch, Pitch is great.  Why 2 stars?   I've been there 4 times in the last 10 months and regardless of how busy the restaurant is, the first and last plates at the table are served 20 minutes apart. Not exaggerating, it's been timed before. I've been in groups of 2 and 3 up to 12. When it was me and a friend, he finished his burger before my salad came out. It's a feature of the ambiance, I guess.  The specials are stated like this \"today's special is a barbecue sandwich and a [unrelated words] Wonder. It's the Wonder of the day\". What kind of meat is the barbecue sandwich? What type of bread? What makes it bbq, does it have sauce or a dry rub? I lost interest at \"Wonder of the day\"  On the way out, I asked for a draft cold brew to go. It was $6. I don't like ice so I asked for no ice. They poured me 2/3rds of the cup... Listen, I'm frugal but that's cheap. Feeling brazen I asked for them to top it off. The first waitress walking by offered to help but not before she wandered around for a minute. Feeling extra brazen, I asked the bartender who poured the original to top it off. Lasers shout out her eyes and melted the bottom of the plastic cup so she had to get me a new one that was repoured the bare limit of what could be called \"a full cup\".  I made this review because every experience is pretty similar. So why two stars? 2 for good food (not great) and 0 for service.  If this were the corporate world, \"service at Pitch\" would be identified as \"an opportunity\".",

Everyone was very satisfied with their meals. Definitely recommend the shrimp tagliatelle! Most places skimp on shrimp dishes, but pitch is very generous with it. A big plus! Atmosphere was really great as well. Will absolutely be back to try brunch and dinner.",

    "text": "Have been a couple times over the past year and I feel like it is going downhill. Got the mixed greens salad (didn't tell them it was to share to avoid the unnecessary split fee) and it tasted (and looked) like a bagged salad from the grocery store that was covered in a too thick dressing. It could have easily been half the size as well, it was unnecessarily huge. The pizza's we got were fine, mine was GF which cost an extra $5 (I know there will be an additional fee but that's a tad high especially since it's not noted on the menu). The worst part though was them charging $2 for each glass of fountain Coke, that's just nickel and dime-ing you. The service was fine but for a final check of $80, it doesn't feel worth it and seems like it's going downhill.",

There are so many great things about this place, I don't even know where to begin so i'm going to make bullet points to make sure that I don't miss a thing!  *Dog-friendly patio *Happy Hour from 3-7p *Gorgeous open-air ambiance *Super friendly service *DELICIOUS cocktails - I had a cucumber + jalapeno mule and it was so fresh and tasty! Not too sweet either.  *They use locally sourced, organic ingredients *Great beer selection *FOOD IS AMAZING!   We ordered their grilled artichoke appetizer to start and you guys, I will be dreaming about this for days. There were 4 BIG artichoke heart halves + stems, grilled to perfection served over a crunchy flatbread with homemade hummus, over mixed greens with tomatoes and an onion vinaigrette. It was all topped with LOADS of parmesan cheese! Like BEYOND dreamy.  For the pizza, we split The Doc which was packed with so many goodies! It had mozzarella, tomatoes, fennel sausage, pancetta, goat cheese, asparagus, and basil, to name a few.   We will be back SO SOON. Like maybe this weekend!! :) Welcome to the neighborhood, Pitch!",

We started with the Charcuterie Board, and shared Spaghetti & Meatballs as well as the Bianco Verde Pizza. Holy flavor explosion in your mouth Batman!  The pasta was great. It was perfectly el dente home made pasta, with a very robust sauce and 4 small meatballs. My husband loved it. I thought it was a bit on the salty side, but that sure didn't stop us from practically licking the plate clean.  The Pizza... Wham, bam, thank you mam, slap your grandma, good!!  Unfortunately we were so full from the meats and cheese (careful looks can be deceiving with that board. It looks lite but man is it filling), we were only able to fit one slice of pizza each, but it was the best darn slice of pizza I've had in a loooooooong time.  Our server Reilly was fantastic! I didnt really care for my cocktail, The Cucumber Smash. It was very tart. He brought it back to the bar and had some adjustments made, it was perfect. Cool and refreshing. All in all my husband and I had a great time and we very much look forward to coming back. Thank you Reilly!!",

    "text": "If you're confused as I was, yes this place is surrounded by a bunch of businesses. I went for weekend brunch with one of my bros. FYI, parking on the left side if you don't know how to enter.  The menu was very extensive. Even so, we still opted for some of the daily specials, like a smoked salmon omelette and a peppadew steak pizza.   I opted for the chicken fried steak and eggs. Classic dish doesn't seem too adventurous, but they made a gravy with white wine that was actually on point. The steak was well battered and thin, just as I like it. However, I will say it wasn't a perfect experience. The succotash had good beans and ham, but it felt like the potatoes were on the side of barely done. Two or three minutes on the flat-top or fryer would have made the dish a home run for me.   The pizza was largely successful, and I think worth being their focus. The thin crust somehow held up against more than a generous portion of toppings, with being neither burnt nor oily. It was a little heavy on peppadews for me, but that might be personal preference. It does get my approval though, and I'll definitely be back to try some of the dinner staples.  Out of curiosity, we tried the creme brulee. Beyond the crisp sugary layer you see specks of black for the fresh vanilla, which you don't see often at restaurants. Some might say it's runny, but I actually loved the softer base - made it eat more like a pudding then a flan.   I think Pitch has a lot of potential, with solid brews and food. I hope it continues to do well so I can come back!",

    "text": "We went here a few months ago for happy hour. The restaurant has a great dog-friendly patio and is within walking distance of our house so we figured this would be a great staple in our happy hour repertoire. The menu is also what I consider leaning towards the \"foodie\" sphere, so we were extra excited. The place crashed and burned hard. They don't have many beers on tap, and only 1 IPA on their entire menu. They cater to cocktails and wine. We started with the calamari; it was bad. I had a few pieces and stopped eating. My date found a piece of plastic bag literally fried into the breading of the calamari, suggesting their calamari comes in a frozen bag. When we mentioned this the manager(?) that came by, he didn't seem phased. We also ordered the arugula salad and the Mia pizza. The salad was good, although the more expensive ingredients (e.g., pear, gorgonzola) were sparse. The pizza was a disaster. I can honestly say it is the worse pizza I have ever had from a restaurant. It tasted like something that you'd buy in the Walmart freezer section AND it was almost $20. It is one thing to be a shitty hole-in-the-wall restaurant, but what pissed me off is that they pretend to be a \"foodie\" location. I walked out of there wishing I had ordered from Dominos, that is how bad it was. On the walk home we left the leftover pizza on the corner near the trash in case a homeless person came by. If you want good pizza go to La Grande Orange in Arcadia.",

Serving was on the smaller side, glad we ordered a side of bacon to accompany. Dining with a toddler can be challenging but we found the staff and atmosphere to be inviting. It was a huge plus that they had a nice courtyard for our little one to run off some energy.  Thank you Pitch for the great experience!",

    "text": "I was excited to try this new restaurant as it is in walking distance from my home, and has a nice outdoor patio.  My first experience was just ok.  Our server was very inexperienced and very under-trained,  breakfast was ok.  coffee was good but they charged me 50 cents for milk they had put in the coffee!!!  that was a shock....however, .being so convenient,I decided to give it another try for lunch, and this time I brought  my family. on a whole the food is fresh and good. The problem occurs with the staff, the waitress and mostly the management.    My brother ordered a breakfast sandwich and asked if the meats (ham and bacon) could be substituted for avocado. and the croissant be substituted for wheat bread.  .   .  He  specifically said \" if that couldn't be done he would choose something else\".  the waitress said \"no problem\"   the orders arrived and  the sandwich was made on a Croissant. :(  He decided to just eat it.  Also,  the little side salad had no dressing on it at all.   he politely asked for some dressing.   When the bill arrived they CHARGED for the avocado as an add on, not substitution for the meats... and they also charged for the salad dressing!!!! , which they had forgotten to put on the salad to begin with... well, I'm a believer that people are reasonable. when we asked about these charges the waitress said, she was sorry but didnt have authority do anything about it. we requested to talk to  the manager, who then came over. and instead of apologizing and taking care of the errors  he was  ARGUMENATIVE, RUDE, SARCASTIC and SURLY.  He presented with the  WORST customer service I have experienced in my 38 years of living in Arizona.  There are many good venues, & great food choices in the phoenix/Scottsdale area.  I will definitely not be returning to Pitch and I'd encourage anyone in the Arcadia/Scottsdale area to spend your money at a place with friendly ,nice staff and management that want to build community and relationships. These people running Pitch don't have a clue of how to become part of a neighborhood, build a local brand, or even how to create a successful business in a closely knit , highly competitive market like ours. Take your inexperienced, brusque, curt and gruff staff back to Omaha......youre not the kind of business we want in our neighborhood.",

Pizza and a bottle of wine for 30 bucks, are you kidding me!? Great service, accommodating and knowledgeable. Great Cocktails. Phenomenal liquor options. Best wine list in the Valley. Beer list should be sampled as well as the Scotch and Tequila selections. Check it out.",

    "text": "I'll start with the good. The patio, atmosphere, and location off the canal earned 3 starts. We rode our bikes here on Friday night with a group of friends. The service was ok, slower, but expected being a new restaurant. Our server was young and messed up a few of the drinks but got the food orders correct and that came out quickly.   But man, the food and the prices wouldn't ever make me want to go back. I was blown away by the prices- $16 for a chicken Caesar salad that was Small and plain. And pizzas are 12\" thin crust for $21! We got the doc as that was what she recommended and hated it. The ingredients didn't work and it had an odd spice. The calamari was big but not much seafood, rather a lot of battered zucchini and way too much breading. Overall we were disappointed. And for a few drinks and some food each couple spent around $75-$100. For beer, wine, and pizza. Not impressed. For this location they better get the prices down or I don't see this place making it.",

The cocktails need a little shaking but once you stir them up they tasted decent. Just a procedural issue i wanted to share",

The food was good, I was bummed they didn't have ranch and our waitress should be trained to be more sociable. She seemed like she didn't want to talk or smile at all. I thought it would've been busier for a Saturday. They do have a big menu though and also offer, breakfast/brunch, and happy hour. They also have a pretty cute outdoor patio too.",

Alcoholic drinks have a good pour so you get your money's worth.  I am a big fan of their extensive menu of Moscow Mules.

They put a tiny skewer, made of slide of sausage, goat cheese stuffed pepper dew, and pickled baby corn cover with spiced salt, on the drink. Both drinks are refreshing and good for Sunday brunch or hot summer.  Then we got half onion rings, and sweet & spicy rosemary wings. The onion ring batter is so delicious and not too fluffy light and not too soaky. When I dipped it with the sauce, sriracha mayo style, they go so well together. The wing plate has a nice high end design. They use the lettuce wedge with blue cheese, instead of the typical celery, carrot, ranch. The wings were juicy and the sweet & spicy rosemary sauce gave me a taste of Asian (sweet & spicy) with fresh herb (rosemary) kick. Delicious!  While waiting for the pizza, we got another round of Arnold Palmer and Midtown Mary. Then the meatball pie pizza has arrived. The meatball pie came right from the oven as we could we the steam coming out of the meatball. The meatball pie has a super thin crust and each slide has half of the big meatball on it. The fresh basil on top does enhance the favor of this delicious pie.  We were too full to get the desserts. Next time we need to plan better so we will have a chance to try the dessert.",

The rock and roll marathon was going on and I found myself unable to drive in any useful direction. I need a brunch place stat, within walking distance. My mom and I walked over to Pitch.  My mom for some reason thought it was three miles away and still started walking. She was very pleasantly surprised!   We sat on the patio. I ordered a mocha, made with Press Coffee, of course. My mom opted for some beer for brunch! For food, I ordered the short rib breakfast burrito. I did not think the menu did a good job describing this item, because it was way better than I thought it was going to be. It was covered in a jalapeno sauce that was more like a soup around the plate. I love sauces so I was very excited about this. It was also served with some very yummy potatoes. The menu made it seem like the potatoes were in the burrito vs. served on the side. I was really glad they were on the side; I love breakfast potatoes.   My mom ordered the weekly wonder, which is a different special each week. When we went, it was chicken enchiladas and she loved them!",

The bartender absolutely nickels and dimes us constantly. Extra charge for dressing, doesn't explain items properly so that we order things that aren't on special (I.e. the $10 soup and salad that was actually $17 because she didn't correct my friend on the parameters), etc.  We are moving offices and looking forward to changing our daily lunch routine.   I like the setup and patio. Staff is nice.",

The staff is always super friendly and the inside and patio are beautiful.  Large open seating areas and huge high top tables.  I've ordered quite a few items from the menu over the last few months and I can say that everything from here is pretty dang tasty.  The Chicken Po Boy's are one of my favorites, along with the meatball Hoagie and their classic flame grilled burger.    I've tried their mac and cheese once which was very good and comes in a cast iron skillet which keeps it hot the whole meal, however the price tag is a little much for a lunch item for me.  paying almost 20 dollars for pasta and cheese is a little much if you ask me.  Their pizza's are also around the 20 dollar range which normally keeps me away from those items as well.  I do love this place and it's a regular spot in my rotation of lunch places and being in the same parking lot as my work is an added bonus!",

The special that night was the taco pie and highly recommended by our server, but it was not was not my favorite.

Let's start with the staff, Brandon was our server/bartender and mainly helped us but literally the entire staff came by at some point (to deliver food, bring more water or pick up plates etc...) and they were all so friendly and looked like they enjoyed working there. We ordered the cauliflower in evoo, the Brussels with parmesan, goat cheese stuffed peppadews and the charcuterie board as well. All of it was great. The board had pickles, hummus, olives, nuts, meats (including duck prosciutto), cheeses and mustard. I mean, it was amazing. To top it off, Matt, the wine guy of this operation came over and we chatted about wine and he made an excellent selection for us. The wine list is fairly priced and on Sunday it's half priced bottles up til $90, then it's 25% off.  All that food and 3 bottles later and our bill was next to nothing. We had carrot cake to end the night and I seriously cannot wait to go back.",

Our waitress was nice and had really great drink suggestions, the food came out promptly and the entire restaurant was just simply lovely all around. The location is just West of Scottsdale Road on Thomas, so its a lot quieter than your average Scottsdale restaurant (score!) There is an all-glass wine cellar near the entrance which gets your mouth watering right when you step inside. Hanging all around are the gold Edison style light bulbs in orb shaped fixtures that illuminate a warm gorgeous glow everywhere. Adjacent to the bar is a very cool rustic style wooden facade mounted above their open kitchen. In it are holes and in the holes are full bottles of beautifully backlit rose wine, which is again very appealing to the eyes and the stomach. The bar has two \"sides\", inside and out, allowing for a very inviting and open, social atmosphere. When the outside portion is open you can view out to the covered patio which is well shaded during the day, and well lit at night (also has overhead warming vents for the colder months). Their happy hour is too good to be True, boasting 1/2 price bottles of wine, $5 any pizza and $1 off brews, including \"combo\" specials of Pizza&Bottle or Greens&Bottle from $30-$50. A seriously fantastic establishment that I cannot wait to visit again.",

The olive bowl was ok-I mean they opened a jar and served them up-which in hind sight was preferable to having the kitchen \"prepare\" your food but this CA girl expects exceptional chef marinated home cured olives if they're actually served as an separate appetizer and not part of a cheese/charcuterie board.  The focaccia bread on top of bowl was ok. The gnocchi dough was made properly but cut into uneven pieces and then completely ruined by a saute of way too much balsamic vinegar.  Half of them were crunchy.  The other half soft. The plate had a bed of marinara with giant chunks of canned tomatoes-no one chopped properly or with even knife cuts.  And the marinara was only on half of the plate. This dish had peas in the mix?  Just look at pix.  Looked as bad as it tasted.  The onion rings were bland and over cooked.  We also ordered their specialty pizza.  We went for a simple margherita.  See pic.  Wow and I don't mean that in a good way  They threw whole canned tomatoes on top. The crust tasted only of charcoal in the spots which were charred otherwise bland and unseasoned.  After we were served I decided there was no head chef and no quality control whatsoever in this place.  This bar is  masquerading as a gastropub.",

We ordered 1/2 of that pizza to have no cheese and the other half light cheese. The cheese side had more cheese, about double the amount of any pizza we've had there before. But we didn't want to bring it up to the server b/c my daughter also ordered spaghetti & meatballs however, no one at the table wanted it because of the taste and we LOVE spaghetti & meatballs, but this was dark red sauce with a layer of grease all over the top of it. My daughter only will eat red meat in a hamburger or meatballs & she LOVES meatballs, but she took one bite and couldn't eat it. We told the waitress there's no way she can eat this, she doesn't usually eat meat except meatballs but she does not like this meal at all.   The server took it away but still charged us for it.   No, you're not required to replace it. But, that shows me you don't care about us returning to your location. Ok, we heard ya, loud and clear!   Try BASE PIZZA it's absolutely delicious and you can watch people night hiking from the restaurant.",

A cursory glance made me think - \"meh, another try-hard but likely mediocre gastropub, dime a dozen these days...\" Was I ever wrong.  First I should preface that if you look at the reviews for this place they're mostly good, but the smattering of sour ones seem to have small problems with service or are made by alcoholics who want long-pouring bartenders. I found lunch service attentive and professional, but I don't drink. Now...if you're looking for quality Italian food - look no further. Wow. Ingredient quality A+. Plate conception A-. Execution A+. San Marzano tomatoes? Check? Perfectly al-dente semolina spaghetti longer than your arm? Check. Tender veal meatballs? Check. Perfectly prepared sauce with the right touch of garlic and pasta water. Check. Appetizers, soups, and salads are all very well conceived with an original touch. Major props to the *real* chefs in the kitchen and to the managers for ordering top quality ingredients.  Pitch is hot and heads above so many sad Italian restaurants I've been to throughout the US over many years. Maybe the heat in Scottsdale isn't so bad after all.",

The flavor is also VERY smoky. The adults loved it but I could see how a child would prefer something more traditional, and again, not served in a skillet (that's a recipe for a disaster)!   I did not get a drink but they had lots of exciting craft cocktails I would love to go back and try. They had a plethora of mules that were different. I'll definitely be back!",

They have transformed it to a different place with an open atmosphere to catch your eye and attention.  Don't blink or you'll miss it just before 60th St on Thomas Road Northside.  Pitch has an array of menu items that the cooks in the back have created and awesome dinning experience.  Let me start with the Smoked Peach BBQ Wings (yes you read it) creatively constructed and paired great (only other place that had them better was in Atlanta,  GA) flavor and the presentation with the iceberg wedge with a creamy blue cheese dressing was on point.  Then it was the Coal-Fired longsteam artichokes dish, prepared nicely and man this is worth traveling here to get.  Keep it up PITCH this is the new spot to get your creative grub on!!!",

    "text": "After a visit to the DBG we found this place just up the street. It has a really cute set up, with a sleek and modern interior as well as an open patio and bar. Two of us were able to snag a table on the patio around 7:30pm on a Saturday night without a wait, so that was awesome!  They have an extensive wine list as well as many cocktail and beer options. Shortly after being seated we were brought water but then had to wait awhile for our server to greet us. It seemed like she had the entire patio so it was kind of understandable it took a bit. Once she did make it to our table she was really nice and filled us in on specials for the evening.   Considering they highlight their pizzas, we both wanted to try one. My girlfriend just got a plain cheese ($12) and I went with the short rib pizza, which was their pizza of the week ($25). While we were waiting for our food, it started to sprinkle on the patio. The staff was fairly quick in getting the umbrellas up and making sure each table was as covered as possible. Props to them there! Although if it had started pouring I'm not sure that we could have stayed dry. Luckily it didn't!  Another thing to note was that my girlfriend got a Diet Coke and they bring you a can and glass of ice.   Once our food came out we were excited to dig in. The pizzas are a large size and definitely big enough to share. We probably should have just split one but it was nice to try two different kinds. We ended up leaving with a full pizza (half of each) on our way out for lunch the next day.   The short rib pizza wasn't bad. It came with carrots, cheese and some type of sauce on top. It was a nice try for a speciality pizza but it didn't stand out as memorable for me. It was good but I wouldn't order it again. Especially for the price, I'm not sure that it really delivered. The cheese pizza was pretty basic (yes we know it's just cheese) but neither of us were big fans of the sauce. Again, it was decent but we probably wouldn't order it again.   Overall, it's a really nice space with friendly service, we just didn't walk away thinking anything special about the food. They do have many pizza variations, as well as pastas, burger options, as well as some main dishes and appetizers. Definitely seems like a good place to have drinks and share some munchies.",

    "text": "Great list of reasonable priced alcohol and lots of menus to choose from:  They offer Breakfast M-F. Brunch Saturday and Sunday. Lunch everyday. Happy Hour M-F 2pm-6pm (food and drink specials)  Dinner everyday.  a Whiskey Menu.   They have gluten free pizza and sandwich bread.  But nothing on the menu is indicated as such. If you have an allergy ask lots of question.   We ordered the COAL-FIRED LONG STEM ARTICHOKES Flatbread with house-made hummus, cherry tomatoes, parmesan, baby green salad, sweet onion vinaigrette, lemon garlic aioli.  Our bartender was able to make it gluten free by omitting the flat bread portion, which he described as more of a chip than a flat bread.  In any case he gave us some cucumbers to accompany the dish.  The dish ended looking more like a salad, with loads of shredded cheese. It was tasty as well as the Lemon Aioli, but too much cheese for my preference.  (I know, who says such a thing?) $12  We also ordered the CAJUN CAESAR SALAD with Avocado anchovy dressing, romaine, house-made croutons, cherry tomatoes, parmesan. Choice of chicken, shrimp or salmon, we opted for the Chicken, $16 (see picture)   Because of my gluten allergy, we ordered our salad without croutons.  The chicken was great, grilled to perfection, could have used a few more slices, considering the price.  However, the salad was also over loaded with shredded cheese, it really took away from the salad itself.  In my opinion, the dressing was watery, and not very flavorful, had a fishy hint to it.  I understand Cesar dressings is made from anchovies, guess what I'm trying to say is, it didn't compliment the salad.   This is a great place for large group gatherings, they have a separate private room that can hold 100+ people. Pretty awesome to have that available. Great gathering place for after work drinks and Birthday parties.   Will be back to try 2 of 7 menus.",

We ordered the shrooms pizza with fried eggs added. We also ordered a custom pizza with roasted chicken, prosciutto, mushrooms, and caramelized onions.   Both of the pizza were delicious. The toppings portions were very generous. The shrooms pizza was deliciously creamy.  My favorite was the custom pizza however. I love prosciutto and I especially appreciated the option of being able to add the prosciutto after the pizza has been cooked to prevent it from being too hot and melty   We enjoyed our lunch here and would definitely want to come back. I recommend checking this place out if you're craving pizza!",

Everything made from scratch?! Sign me up.  Nomz: The pizza here is fan-freakin-tastic. Can't go wrong with their \"Dos or Tres Peps\" (if you're a spicy fan, add jalapenos to that - SO good). Their \"Shrooms\" is also heavenly. If you're a mushroom fan, the truffle oil and parsley combination will knock your socks off. Their pizzas are loaded with flavor, and the crust is so effing good. With a perfect crisp, you won't be able to put it down. For realz. All the pizzas range from $14-$21, really decent prices for the fresh products you're getting.   I only really came for the pizza, but the rest of their menu looked phenomenal. There's truly too many dishes to choose from, so I'd recommend grabbing a group of friends and sharing all the goods! Don't forget to try their appetizers! The coal-fired long stem artichoke salad is unreal. It's a really large portion though, you can definitely share it with multiple people. I saw a few others and they all looked amazing.  Libations: They've got a full bar, and great cocktails to choose from. A pretty large beer selection (+ some local drafts), along with some great wine selections. All normal prices. They also offer a number of unique Moscow Mules which is pretty impressive.  Happy Hour! I'll have to come back for this. Mon-Fri 2-6 PM. $1 off beers, 1/2 price bottles of wine (score!), and $5 off pizzas. Doesn't get much better than that.   Tip: They offer a multi-course private chef experience with food and wine pairings, sounds fun for a special occasion if you're looking for something unique.  Overall experience: Holy smokes, dat was goooood. And their service was amazing. We had multiple people drop by our table to make sure we had everything we needed. Very pleasant energy there! Will definitely be returning to check out the rest of their menu!",

Despite a few hiccups in the food and service, we enjoyed our dinner.      Service was a little spotty with a forgotten drink order, and water glasses that did not get refilled. As for the food, we shared the onion rings (half order - crispy, hot), the Thai Pie  (ok),  and the Artichoke Flatbread (not really what I was expecting but tasty).   For the main course, I ordered the duck entree, cooked 'medium' as recommended by our server, but it was served rare.  I sent it back and the second time around it was very good.       I look forward to sitting outside next time and trying other items from the menu.",

If you like artichokes I recommend the appetizer but be prepared it is not served like you will expect-it's more a salad but the chokes are amazing and the dish is fantastic! The parpadelle is amazing so is mushroom pizza! The only reason they dont get 5 stars is because we have been many times now since they opened and they still cannot figure out how to time their meals to hit the table at once. We've been 10+ and it has happened 100% of the time. Be prepared for your meals to come it separately. Otherwise Pitch is one of our favorites!",

We wanted to try a bunch of different things & ended up ordering two happy hour dishes & two starters; Angus beef sliders, Bolgonese Fries, Basil Gnocchi & Brussel Sprouts. The sliders were our least favorite of the dishes. We both agreed there wasn't enough meat or cheese plus the reduced balsamic drizzled on the top of the bun made our hands sticky & was hard to get off. The Brussel Sprouts were the 2nd to least favorite. The flavor was delicious, but the sprouts were unfortunately soggy & not at all roasted & crispy. The Basil Gnocchi also was delicious. I wasn't big on the gnocchi being infused, the pesto flavoring was drowned out by the red sauce as it sat surrounded by peas. The Bolognese Fries with truffle oil were the winning dish. The fries were so thin & crispy they were addictive. For sure some of the best fries I've had in Scottsdale yet. The sauce and ricotta on top paired perfectly with the truffle oil. Can't wait to come back to Pitch & try one of their pizzas or pasta that are supposed to be pretty good. Definitely coming back, however, for those fries.",

Then we moved on to the entrees and we had the Short Ribs Enchilada and the Creme Brulee Stuffed French Toast...nothing short of amazing! The flavor profiles of both were off the charts.

It is a large space with a great outdoor patio decorated urban chic with open kitchen. The staff was great very friendly and accommodating and we were impressed with great selection of tequilas and bourbons. My husband and I shared a neat Pappy Van Winkle 15 Year Reserve which was modestly priced considering the cost of a bottle which was excellent and the bartender was nice enough to have purchase a half shot of an unusual wine barrel aged tequila which was also very good. As for the dessert it was just okay. We shared the Key Lime Pie that our server raved about it but to us it was nothing to rave about and underwhelming at best. It seemed fresh and we were told it was made in-house but seemed more like it might have come from a box with a small dollop of whipped cream on top and some kind of raspberry sauce that surrounded the dish. Based on the dessert I'm not sure if it would be worth a return trip if the other menu items are just as underwhelming which is sad because it really is a nice place.",

Servers were pleasant. Lots of them standing around, waiting for more business.  My husband's cheeseburger had excellent flavor with a fresh bun. His shoestring fries were good and plentiful. I would not re-order the corned beef hash. Too many large-chunk potatoes and not enough other flavors. The meat in it was ok.  They could use some fly control. Big open garage doors allowed many flies in.  Will be back to try other items.",

Calamari, more breading (like fried chicken breading) and pepperoncinis than calamari, the sauce was tasty though.  \"Tiger shrimp\" tagliatelle, the shrimp were tiny, not tiger shrimp at all, and the sauce was more creamy than and lemon garlicky as described, though the noodles were delicious.  Filet I understand was delicious as were the scalloped potatoes.  Crab cake appetizer not good, as the salad thing under it had bean sprouts and beans and who knows what else, very weird.  The crab cake itself lacked flavor.  Cool ambience but only like five beers on tap?  Rest in bottles.  Needs some tightening on the food and draft beer for sure.",

The bad: Everything is pricier than I think is merited. $21 pizza is kind of insane in this area. The place is across from a Fry's parking lot. I mean, it's pizza. $3 a topping? Come on. I also didn't like their misleading menu. The happy hour menu says \"$5 off any pizza.\" We ordered a create-your-own pizza and didn't get the discount. I asked why and was told that the create-your-own isn't included in the Happy Hour deal. I'm not going to fight about $5, but that was misleading and disappointing and illogical. When I suggested they change the wording of \"any pizza\" they responded \"we're not changing our menu, we've never gotten any complaints.\" I thought the attitude was dismissive and kind of embarrassing. I'm a customer giving you a (rational) suggestion. Even if you're not going to change it, at least acknowledge that you can see where it might be confusing, and approach it with a less smarmy attitude. They did give us a $10 gift card, which I appreciate, but I will not be back, even though I live across the street.",

We were missing one chair.  Reminded our server.  The rest of our party arrived and still no chair.  Our reservation was booked days in advance. We got appetizers, then ordered entrees.  We needed kids menus and they needed to make copies. My husband requested more water.  Our server never came back.  I went to remind him about the menus and water.  Our entries began arriving.  All our appetizer plates were still cluttering the table, and still no water refills. I went to find out server to ask if they could clear our table and refill waters.  He got a big attitude.  A girl came to clear.  We were assisting her by handing her plates.  Most meals arrived except two.  Eventually my nephews salad arrived.  My sons burger arrived after I asked the estimate?  The kitchen had made an error on it.  By the time it arrived the entire table was done.  He had snacked on appetizers and half my husbands pasta.  I let the waiter know he just could not eat it as it came so late.  He responded with \" oh I'll wrap it up for home!\"  Honestly they should've removed it from the bill.  I'm very disappointed in the service.  Good food, good atmosphere, poor",

I like that it's not located in the MESS of Scottsdale traffic. Makes going there more pleasant. Kids shared cheese pizza, & hubby and I shared The Doc. We also shared a mushroom salad. The food was tasty.  If you prefer your pizza dough to be toasty/crunchy throughout your slice, then this place is it! I'm not a fan of soggy pizza. Even with all our toppings, it held up. The flavor/seasoning is well balanced and light.  The salad was yummy and not dripping in dressing, the vinaigrette dressing taste was subtle and paired well with the pistachios, spinach & cheese... Standard drinks are served by the can which is cool, until you want a refill or 2, $. But I like the can idea! because it's way cleaner than the soda dispensers, bacteria builds up quick if it's not cleaned regularly. Overall, pretty darn good. We'll most likely try a white pizza our next go-round!",

Unfortunately, something annoyingly dumb happened, and it will just nag at me to the point I probably won't go back.  The happy hour says ANY pizza is $5 off, but of course, this apparently doesn't apply to 'create-your-own' pizzas which they didn't mention when I ordered one. To add a level of nonsensical absurdity to the bait-and-switch, the custom pizza costs $12 with \"San Marzano tomato sauce & mozzarella\" before adding your ingredients. But $6 of \"extra mozzarella\" and \"fresh mozzarella\" was added for no reason, and when I brought it up, the waitress acted like this was totally normal. Like every pizza obviously needs extra and fresh cheese. Because the mozzarella it comes with would never be enough. So apparently everyone who orders a 'create-your-own' pizza gets a mystery charge for mystery cheese. Sure.  So I spent almost $40 on one little pizza and a drink. During happy hour. No thank you.",

I love the look of the restaurant - open, airy with lots of patio space, which is perfect for this time of year.  I'm a bit worried about them for summer because that's a west-facing patio and windows - that's gonna get hot!    First - our server was awesome.  We sat on the patio for lunch, and it was beautiful.  People were playing corn-hole on the green area.  The menu has a great selection with some really interesting options.  Two of us ended up ordering the short-rib grilled cheese and picked greens as our side.  The others ordered the shrimp po-boy and the long-stemmed artichoke salad.  I was really intrigued by the mac-and-cheese - it is filled with good for you veggies (spinach, mushrooms, etc.) and you can add chicken or shrimp.  Next time!   Wow - we all loved the food.  The grilled cheese had LOTS of short-rib. As a matter of fact, I would recommend asking for a little sauce on the side because it was just a tad dry.  But filling!  I liked the dressing for the salad - it had a bit of ginger and was yummy.    Those grilled long-stem artichokes looked fabulous (and my friend said they were) - I see these are also available as a starter, and I plan to try those soon.  The shrimp po-boy had buffalo sauce, and my friend said that it was a bit much - be sure to recommend SOS (sauce on the side).   I plan to meet other friends there this evening for Happy Hour - I can see this becoming a favorite rendezvous - at least until summer.",

Taylor was our server and she was fantastic. Very engaging and always coming by to check if we needed anything even though it was a busy Friday night. We will be back!",

It is rather pricey and since it is a coal cooking place there is that burnt smell in the air. I did not enjoy the smoky smell but overall it was a decent place. Server was very nice as well.",

    "text": "We dined here for the first time, and YUM! They have flavored iced teas, my boyfriend got the jasmine blackberry and I had the earl grey (my favorite kind of tea) and they were very refreshing! Everything on their menu sounded delicious, but we came here for the pizza and decided on the Margarita pizza with an added balsamic drizzle. The pizza crust was airy and crispy, there was the perfect amount of cheese and the sauce was very \"grandmas secret recipe \" tasting- SO GOOD. For dessert we had the seasonal berry cobbler with gelato on top and it came out hot and bubbly from the oven. The service was also impeccable, and overall were very impressed by this restaurant. I am so glad we found this spot and can't wait to come back for more great food!  Also - They had 1/2 off bottles of wine which we will definitely keep in mind the next time we're headed here.",

The bartenders were friendly and truly loved their job.  We will definitely be making the drive back.",

    "text": "When we arrived we received a very friendly greeting and were given our choice of indoor or patio seat. Since with weather was delightful we chose the patio. Our server was very friendly as well. We order vanilla lattes and reviewed the menu.   This spot is biking distance so I was really excited to try it out. I was disappointed to see there was not pancake options however they had a breakfast burrito on the menu and they are my go to breakfast option. I ordered the short rib burrito and my husband got the breakfast special, biscuits and gray.  The food didn't take long to arrive. The presentation was lovely. My meal was delicious! Short rib burrito topped with scrambled eggs and a side of breakfast potatoes with chorizo sausage. It also had this tasty jalapeno cheese sauce.   My husbands meal didn't live up to the hype. His biscuit took up most of the dish, there wasn't enough gray or sausage. He was a little disappointed. However he got the other half of my meal so that made up for his order envy.",

The patio is really cute and the open design of the building is really nice. The crab cake salad is also extremely good but the pizza is the star of the show. They have extremely high quality ingredients and you can taste it in every bite.",

The whole staff here is excellent.   We've been back several times now to eat there or get take out. It's always busy, but the restaurant is really well run. The staff seems to enjoy their time there. They have a great atmosphere with an indoor/outdoor bar and a few local beer selections.   Of all things we've gotten, the pappardelle pasta stands out as the best to me, but the other pastas and the pizzas we have had are all really good with one exception; the spaghetti. I wouldn't recommend the spaghetti as it's likely not what you're expecting. But, maybe it's just me as I don't like angel hair pasta.  It may seem a bit pricy at first glance, but the quality of food is their. Their pasta and sausages are made in house. Pitch is one of our new favorite spots.",

It was dining then movie screening. #1 Really BAD service includes several people holding menus up to shield the glaring sun from our eyes the bald dude had to be asked SEVERAL TIMES to move the umbrella that was standing feet away. He did not move it to help us, the staff just watched as we kept holding menus to block our eyes & played musical chairs moving every few minutes to be able to see!!! Lazy. #2 staff tried to kick us all off the table after 30 minutes and we already ordered saying it was supposed to have been reserved  [ had no reserved sign & we were TOLD that table was for us and there were 2 of our party members already sitting there for a while when we sat down] so right as our food was about to come they again tried to kick us off after we just ordered, #3 another staff, I assumed the manager came & AGAIN told us that \" this table was supposed to be for others but you guys can just stay here we will figure it out \" oookkk,,,, WHY COME TELL US THAT ??? WE ARE A PARTY OF 50 PEOPLE eating meals .. so STUPID!!!  #4 staff came back after we had JUST STARTED EATING said we did have to move and #4 had US ALL CARRY OUR OWN FOOD plates & glasses off that table into the film room [ I personally has 3 plates of foods and a water & cocktail] which ALL ARE IN MY REFRIGERATOR UNEATEN GOOD BYE $43!!! for actually drinking my 1 cocktail!! #5 we had to sit for 30 minutes without any service in the movie room #6 sat freezing in the ICE COLD WINDY ROOM #7 some genius had the FAN on NOT A/C so it was 62CONSTANT FLOWING air blowing FREEZING US & blowing wind on us & in our faces for nearly 2 hours straight. #8 MADE US CASH OUT OUR TABS WHILE WE were TRYING to eat & made us open a new tab if we wanted to order more drinks #9 left my food on the wind blowing table for 30 minutes after I ASKED 2 DIFFERENT PEOPLE more than once FOR BOXES so my 3 plates of food sat there under WINDY dusty air vents constantly blowing air all over my food #9 forced me to get ugly and DEMAND she walk her ass over NOW to bring me a box #10 charged me +$4 to do 1/2 the nuts the dish already came with #11 served me SALTY WAY UNDERCOOKED sprouts ...   and even tho she SHOULD HAVE known our party of FIFTY the film started at 6.30 she put all of our orders in a 6pm after we strongly reminded her multiple times .. other than that it was ok ....so long and good bye FOURTY THREE DOLLARS for 1/2 an order of onion rings, a side of brussels sprouts that were BARELY COOKED and a salad and one cocktail.. ALL UNEATEN because it had dusty air vents strongly BLOWING on it for 30+ minutes . Cant bring myself to just toss it all, I'll try to cook the sprouts myself. ANNOYED  if it was not my friends documentary we were there for, my entire party would have just up & WALKED AWAY . I doubt they will respond to this but I thought I would tell how my first experience at Pitch went from start to GLORIOUS FINISH! with SO MANY flaws and givin that the big party had been pre planned for MONTHS they need to get it together! I feel that they OWE us to show us they can do a good business. ... OR CAN THEY????????",
