    "text": "If you want a great dining experience, don't go to Chestnut Fine Foods and Provisions in Phoenix. Just don't.  You'll walk in to the breakfast and lunch spot, like I did on a recent Sunday morning, and you'll be greeted by a  crowd of people standing in disorganized lines to order -- not exactly a relaxing way to start your breakfast.  Then, they'll be out of your favorite drink -- in my friend's case, it was the Lavender Honey Iced Latte. The person taking your order won't be friendly, just indifferent. Even when you tip more than 20 percent at this order-at-the-counter eatery, don't expect great service.  The girl who delivers the coffee latte you had to settle on will scowl as she sets it down on your table, which, by the way, has no silverware or napkins.  Now, the fun part -- my pal and I waited 30 minutes for our food, watching as tables who sat down after us received theirs. When my pal finally asked what was up, we found out our ticket had been \"burned\" -- meaning the order had mistakenly been perceived as already delivered -- which means our food hadn't even started to be cooked. This message was delivered by the sous-chef, who actually told my friend and I, \"I'm delivering the food because everyone in the kitchen is messing up.\" If only that was followed by an, \"And your meal is free because we're giving sucky service today.\"  My friend received her coffee 15 minutes before I got my orange juice, and when we finally got our food, the disappointing experience continued. Sure, my Lemon Ricotta Waffles ($7.25) were OK, but my friend's Green Eggs and Ham ($7.50), she said, was horrible. It came with poached eggs, prosciutto, pesto and arugula on an English muffin, and she said the English muffin was hard, the egg was runny, there wasn't enough pesto, and the ham was undercooked. Even if I wasn't vegetarian, I would still think that was really gross.  Maybe we would have left with a better taste in our mouths if the people working at the Chestnut actually seemed like they cared about the people eating there. For now, I'd recommend never going there. Ever.",

We went there for Sunday brunch and they were out of champagne, grapefruit juice, and green juice. I ordered the salmon kale toast, and the \"smoked salmon\" was literally a can of grey salmon dumped on top of the toast. It was still in the shape of the can! My friend's pancake was raw in the middle. A sign fell off the wall and hit my other friend in the head and they only offered her half off her next beverage. We explained some of our issues to the food runners, and they couldn't care less. There are way too many great brunch places in Scottsdale/Phoenix to ever go back here.",

Or at least that's what I think with the heavy steel chairs with that flooring... There were many children there this morning and aside from the screaming and yelling... The kids were rearranging furniture and such... My main concern being the chairs and tables... Not very kid-safe...  I am not sure how I feel about this place, it's cute, perhaps I will give it another go soon...   Stay tuned Yelp",

    "text": "Such an adorable restaurant and what a bonus- the food is fantastic!!!  I love the spin the owners took on this menu; there is a little bit of everything for any type of eater.  I personally fell in love with two things my first time there and I cannot get enough of them, the Lobster Roll and the Bonh Mi.  One would more than likely picture a Lobster Roll in Scottsdale as some canned lobster with mayo on a sub, but not here!!  Chestnut served it with huge chunks of fresh lobster with an amazing sauce that has a bit of kick to it. (PS- I would kill for the recipe)! The Bonh Mi is something that I have never had anywhere.  My husband has been to Asia multiple times though so he was excited to try.  When I took a bite of his I was in heaven!  The chicken mixed with the pickled onions, cilantro and spicy mayo was such a great combo.  My husband said it compared to what he has had overseas.  Staff is kind and helpful.  Restaurant super clean and the decor is cool modern with a rustic twist.  Can't wait to return",

I love that I can order my entire meal at the counter, while being dazzled by their selection of Tammy Coe pastries and various other home baked goods, such as the decadent Almond Croissant (of which our party had 3).  It is nice getting my daily juice fix with their \"Green Market Goodness\" with kale, cucumber, orange, lemon and olive oil and satisfying my sweet tooth with the Lemon Ricotta Waffles (honey ricotta cheese and blueberry compote).  My favorite savory selection here is the \"Sandi\" with gruyere, arugula, truffle aoli, egg, and choice of meat.  The wide open space that lets in the natural light on all sides, the centralized pastry bar, the flower shop in the corner, the coffee and juice bar by the door, the kids corner where your little ones can entertain themselves while you order another Cartel coffee,  the outdoor seating, the low level of noise generated by other customers, the cool beats heard overhead, I thoroughly enjoy this spot for breakfast.",

The highlights have been the Bruce Lee-- don't be deterred by the spicy ingredients, you'll love it-- and the Green Goddess salad with the delicious noodles underneath. Service is fast and efficient-- walk-ups are my favorite, no waiting for a server.   There's a camelback flower shop inside and it's fun to enjoy their little arrangements on your table.   I'm a sucker for cute delicious places, especially in the Arcadia area, and I absolutely recommend coming here!",

Only complaint was the menu board had less items than the printed menu and they didn't point that our ahead of time. The printed menu has some delicious sounding items we would have ordered instead! Now we have to go back ;) but that's ok with me!",

The calamari was chewy and tasted disgusting. The server obviously saw that we didn't like it. She never offered us a new appetizer or to take it off the bill. She then brought us our check without offering us dessert. We decided to order the mango and sticky rice as take out. Worst decision ever! The rice was hard and not even sticky. The mango was chalky not even ripe. Seriously, so terrible!! Go for the ramen but don't order anything else!",

Ive been wanting to come here forever and finally did a post hike brunch with some girlfriends. The service at the register was polite, you could tell she was new and was a little slow but no biggie there. I ordered the Sandi with turkey, bacon, arugula, gruyere, a poached egg, and truffle aioli served on a pepper roll. It was... just ok. I don't know why something with that many flavorful ingredients was so average, bordering on bland- I had to get an extra side of the aioli to add more flavor. My poached egg was overdone where the yolk wasn't runny at all which made me sad. On the upside- the portions were large and there was a lot of meat on the sandwich that I liked. I got a bloody mary and my friends got mimosas- they were ok. I love the location so much and the vibe of the place so I'm not ruling out a future visit to try something different on the menu- i just don't think I'll be in a hurry.",

    "text": "I was excited to check this out as a new nearby lunch place (close to work) and suggested we try it to my co-workers on Friday.   First drawback: the parking. Almost worse than LGO. And it's not even busy yet. Small lot that is hard to get to - being on the busy intersection.  Most of the open spots were reserved for other businesses so this will for sure be a drawback in the future.   Second: Menus weren't up and you didn't really know where to order.  We were given paper menus. Tried ordering an Arnold Palmer or Strawberry Lemonade and both were not available yet. ?? One of my co-workers tried to order one of the juice drinks at the top of the menu and they didn't have those yet either. Then another co-worker tried to order breakfast for lunch and again - they didn't do breakfast at lunch (but, like most places) did not have this indicated on their menu.   Two of us ordered the 5-spice Ban Mi sandwich, one got the egg salad and another the grilled cheese with bacon. I also had ordered a 1/2 order of fruit salad because it sounded different. Pretty disappointing. The ban mi sandwiches were tasty and large portions - but nothing that I think I will be craving anytime soon for $9. The co-worker who got the egg salad said it was just plain egg salad and didn't have any \"tang\" to the dressing that the menu indicated. Then my co-worker who got the grilled cheese said it was just okay but had a weird sweetness to it. And they forgot the bacon (which they promptly put on it when she let them know). My half fruit salad was pretty sad - the menu said it would have lime juice, creme freche (sp?)  and honey - all of which were completely missing.  And the fruit was un-flavorful white colored strawberries, small pieces of pineapple and blueberries. Thought about trying to get my money back but would have been too much of a hastle.   Also, watching the staff - one of my co-workers used to work at Sam Fox restaurants - she made the comment that they all seemed to be new to the food service industry. They definitely need more training.  Our conclusion: They weren't ready to open yet and needed to spend time \"working out the kinks.\"    I might try it again in several months and if so I'll update my review. But, definitely wouldn't recommend spending your money here until they work out some issues!  Other notes: The design is very nice and the florist shop inside is amazing. But with its high price points and certain style I wonder how long it will last....   The two stars are for the decor/design, the yummy sweet potato chips and spicy pickled cucumbers that came with our sandwiches.",

Our order included the green eggs and ham, ricotta and blueberry waffles, and the scramble (traditional 2 egg breakfast).   The atmosphere is casual, open, and well lit. They have an antique shop and an area for kids to play all within the restaurant. Succulents adorn most tables and some seating may be reserved.   Our drinks were delivered quickly to our table which included an iced coffee and the Julius. The Julius is a healthier version of what you would traditionally expect. I enjoyed it quite a bit! The iced coffee was supposed to have extra ice, the ice amount was a little less than expected.   The green eggs and ham included a poached egg, with arugula, pesto, and prosciutto on top a very yummy bun. 10 out of 10 for flavor, texture, and heat. I was definitely happy with this choice.   The waffles that came to the table, we were told, may have been sitting out for a bit, so they replaced them with a new order without us asking. The difference really was the temperature. I actually didn't notice until they brought the second plate. (Much appreciated!) The honey and ricotta add a unique twist on blueberry waffles. I would order again.  The two egg breakfast, I'm told by my breakfast companion, was as good as eggs can be over hard. I had some of the bacon from this entree and it was very sticky and sweet to me. This bacon, while tasty, was not as crispy as I would have hoped.   Overall, I would visit again, and I'd love to try some of the other items on their menu. They have a matcha chai pudding and many pastries that looked beyond delicious.",

Amazing eggs, the sweetest bacon, and fluffy pancakes (for a scramble). Now there seemed to be barely one egg, not warm when served. The bacon was nothing to write home about. Pancakes as well. Still a decent breakfast, but not as amazing as it used to be! It used to be okay to be overpriced because of the delicious food- now I would prefer to go to First Watch just down the street.  Hoping they bring back their original recipes.",

When I asked if I could get a lavender latte that's not 24oz he said there's no way that he can do that, but I can drink any other drink in a smaller size. That was all okay. But when I went to eat their blueberry muffin, the top totally crumbled and the muffin is raw. No thanks. Mama's cold brew is good. But, I will stick to getting it from other local businesses.",

    "text": "Chestnut Fine Food & Provisions is a hidden gem located in the heart of Scottsdale located off of Camelback and 44th Street. Chestnut is a vintage cottage type place with a touch of modern with the bright yellow and grey coloring throughout that offers both indoor and outside seating. What an oasis! It's similar to the restaurant Sauce Pizza & Wine in a way hence the food. You order at the counter, pick a number, and seat yourself and a food runner/server will bring you your food! They offer both breakfast + lunch, juices, coffee, tea, and a full bar! Their menu is super fun and \"homey\". They do a modern twist on simple dishes and adds their own touch.   Breakfast  I have a little bit of a sweet tooth so my breakfast \"go to\" is their Lemon Ricotta Waffles! Belgian waffles cut into four wedges, lemon ricotta cheese with a blueberry compote! So yummy!! I've also had their Banana Bread Pancakes which is another popular menu option along with the waffles which is topped with candied walnuts and orange zest! Their Salmon toast is also very delicious! Comes on a toasted bread with salmon, sauteed kale and scramble eggs!   Lunch  Haven't gotten to experiment much with their lunch menu, but I've had their Grilled Cheese Sammie and Lobster Cobb salad. Both super yummy!!   Services is always super friendly and fast! I absolutely love that they have a play area for the kiddos to keep them occupied! My daughter has had plenty of play dates here! I've been here on many different occasions whether it's brunch and mimosas with the girls, or breakfast with the fam Chestnut makes each visit enjoyable! Never have had a bad experience! I live in west Phoenix, but if I'm ever in the area I will always make a trip to Chestnut.",

I ordered a turkey sandwich. They use toothpicks to hold their sandwiches together. I pulled out the toothpick and continued to read my paper. I did not notice the toothpick was broken and subsequently I bit into and swallowed part of the section of the toothpick that remained inside the sandwich. I showed the cashier what happened and she asked me if I was ok, and refunded my money right away. I sat in my car wondering what to do, since it felt like the pick was stuck in my throat. Well I went to the emergency room since I was concerned and they took Exrays. Just heard from the insurance company they will not cover my medical charges. Buyer be aware they won't take responsibility for broken toothpicks in the food they serve. What a shame.  Regarding the response I received, really?! Kirsten doesn't your insurance company represent your establishment? Ok the ex rays did not show any foreign object, because I had swallowed it. The doctor said it likely scratched my throat which is why it felt like something was still there. I still wasted my afternoon at the hospital and experienced fear and discomfort due to the carelessness of whomever made my meal. The most expensive meal of my life.",

Unfortunately it can also be quite mediocre. The pastry is particularly strong, and this is a great place to drop in and have a cup of coffee and a piece of cake. That is especially True if there isn't some inconsiderate lout lolling about talking incessantly on his phone. The last time I was there, that's what happened and nobody would take responsibility for asking him to behave appropriately, not even when he put his feet up on a table. Now back to the mediocre food. I had a nice fruit plate. The fruit was reasonably fresh perhaps a little under-ripened and the honeyed walnuts, while few, were good. My wife had the short ribs, on a plate rather than in a sandwich. They were dry to the point of limited edibility. The sweet potato chips served with her meal were, however, quite good. However, bad protein equals bad review. So, would I go back? Yes. The place is right near my physician's office and I usually eat breakfast after my visit so blood can be drawn. I certainly don't want to then drive looking for something to eat. However, I don't see returning for lunch and I doubt my wife would be willing to even if I wished.",

I love this place! It reminds me of little urban coffee shops on the east coast mixed with that Northern California Farmer's Market / Artisanal twist.   They are a little on the pricey side. One morning it was close to $9 for an iced coffee and a side of eggs. The eggs were perfectly cooked.  All of their ingredients are very fresh. I had the kale salad which unfortunately had too many raisins for my liking, but they were easy to pick out.   One of my cousins had the French toast that she was not particularly impressed by so she grabbed a pastry that she enjoyed instead.   My other cousin got the eggs benedict with arugula that she loved. Entree envy. We were treated with great service.  They also offer flower bouquets from the camelback flower shop. They're gorgeous. I have to stop myself from splurging every time I go in there.   I definitely recommend this if you are in town. They also have a little area to entertain the kiddos while mom and pop have a date.",

After looking online for where to get Mama's Cold Brew on a Sunday we made the trip to Chestnut and we won't be returning.   To start the line to order was out the door but only 5 tables or so were occupied. The cashier looked frustrated and another gentleman came and took over. The line was moving slowly but moving. We ordered 2 cold brew coffees, a scramble plate, a soup, and a cookie. We were informed by the gentleman that Mama's creamer is 1.50 extra each coffee (no problem), but cold brew coffee refills are free (great). He poured quite a bit of creamer in (a little much) but being we could get coffee refills I figured I would drink some down and make room for coffee.  Maybe we ordered the wrong thing but our food was underwhelming with the exception of the cookie. We sat on the patio and despite 3 bus boys running around tables were still dirty with dishes.   On our way out I walked up to the girl behind the bar but not the cashier and asked for a coffee refill.There was still a line and I was trying to avoid stepping back into it. We had barely drank any it was very sweet with the excess creamer. She said she was new and unsure. I told her what the cashier had told me and she complied. The cashier then stops her and tells her we have to be charged. My husband said \"for what\"? We walked to a different cashier so that he could charge us for...a splash of coffee? To which my husband said \" I will pay you but please tell me what I am paying for.\" After an explanation we were allowed to leave.    Mama's Cold Brew was on sale for take home, I really wanted to buy some but did not due to line and just wanting to get the heck out of there.   1 star for the cookie, 1 because we didn't hate the place",

I take responsibility of not knowing how much drink was as I looked at the menu board and not the actual menu. When I questioned the cost ..I was told well it is served in a large cup. Yes it is, and I got maybe 6oz watery coffee with pretty foam . If you are going to charge $6.00 for a coffee/latte whatever  don't serve it in a 20 oz cup. And I do know it is a 20 oz. cup. I went home with my big cup/tiny drink and brewed a cup with my Keurig..........still tasted watery.  I was told 2 different stories about the drink.

Numerous tables were complaining about the length of time it took to get items (30 minutes for flavorless waffles for us), the taste of the food, and the lack of silverware.  When the table next to us told the manager her response was \" I  trying!\" What?!?!

It's important to note that these are a gluten free  and healthful option and therefore are not the standard fluffy white pancakes you'll get elsewhere (although they have those too). They are more akin to a whole grain banana bread than a pancake. A couple in our order were slightly too brown on one side but the others just right. Other dishes ordered at our table were good too, with the eggs coming out cooked as requested, and the sandwiches are a good choice too, particularly the Ban Mi. Where to order is still slightly confusing, and depending on who's at the register you get a warm, friendly, smile or an apathetic stare, but that's probably the case at most casual restaurants on a Sunday morning.",

I'm not into a lot of sweets and the oatmeal is just like the Olive and Ivy's, so thought I'd try something simple like 1 scrambled egg and toast.  You'd think there would be a nice plate with a fluffy scrambled egg and crispy toast, no , just two poor plates:one  with 2 so so eggs and one with a piece of warm bread.  the waiter did ask if I wanted something on the \"bread\" and I asked for butter, he delivered practically frozen butter. coffee was strong almost bitter.  yes, parking is difficult depending on what way you are coming in.  ambiance is nice, otherwise there are many other options in the area. and I'm surprised after the big build up in the Arcadia News that the owner isn't answering any of the yelp comments.  I should know better: you have to order the specialties, they can't do simple.",

    "text": "The owners obviously gave significant thought to the concept and design;  unfortunately the food fails to reflect the necessary level of excellence required to compete in this wonderful neighborhood bastion of great restaurants that has been developing in recent years.  The grilled cheese was on two thick slices of tasteless bread and the cheese and tomatoes were flat.  Most importantly, the grilled cheese was not really even grilled.  A good grilled cheese should be beautifully golden and melty and crispy;  but this was not the case here, instead it was pasty and lacked flavor.  The quinoa salad had very little quinoa;  it would be better characterized as an arugula salad with quinoa.  A True quinoa salad is a plate of quinoa with mixed dried fruit.  We ate a bite or two and left.  No one noticed our dissatisfaction and seemed like a bunch of young servers running around like chickens without heads and no front of the house management.  Very disappointing and will be surprised if this place makes it with a gem like The Henry, which recently opened across the street.",

There was only one couple in line in front of us and they let us order first because they could not decide what they wanted to eat. The staff was nice, clean and had a hip vib.  We ordered and found a seat easily and our drinks came out right away. I had the Sandi, a breakfast sandwich with honeyed bacon, cheese (I cant remember what type), arugula with an egg. The flavors played off each other well. I think for the type of food being served their price point is spot on. The only thing I did not care for was the coffee, it is probably a great coffee for people who cream and sugar but not for black coffee, in my opinion. Our food arrived in a timely fashion too.  There was a steady flow of customers and everyone seemed to be pleased.  I plan on trying it out again next time I am in the area.",

After living in NY, LA, SF and Miami this place has the feel of a great neighborhood restaurant in one of those cities. The owners are almost always there and the staff is very friendly. Any kinks from just opening have been addressed quickly (lots of new signage, etc) and they really listen to their clients. Great kids menu, too!",

    "text": "We waited in anticipation for Chestnuts to open as we enjoy a great breakfast or lunch out in our neighborhood.  We had a guest in town, so we thought we'd give it a shot.  We were not prepared for the \"order at the counter and scramble to try to get a seat\" scenario. There are only about 10 indoor tables. Several patio tables, but too cold to sit outside. We hovered over a table that was about to be vacated.  We were seated at least 10 minutes without any gesture for the table to be cleaned so we cleared the table ourselves.  We had to flag down a hurried waiter to bring us silverware.  No attempt was made to wipe or disinfect the table.  We scored the last table near the children's play area.  Seems like a good concept for parent's of small children.  Two toddlers were placed there to eat their breakfast from the low (filthy) play table.  From watching the children eat with their hands and then touching the toys, it seemed like a breeding ground for bacteria.  Our 2 lobster rolls and club sandwich came in a timely manner.  The lobster rolls which were overly doused with spicy remoulade drowned out any flavor of the lobster. The club sandwich was overly toasted and very bland.  A stark contrast from the spiceness of the lobster roll!  I asked for a side of mayonnaise just to give it some taste.  The maple bacon was the only salvation on the sandwich.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is noisy and hurried.  Not conducive to a leisurely relaxing breakfast or lunch (especially with customers waiting to snatch the next available table.  Sorry to say that we were disappointed and won't be back.",

My only complaint is that they used to squeeze their juice fresh (the Bruce lee is my go to, I stop by at least once a week to pick up) but they have changed it and have the juice pre-squeezed. The best time to drink juice is within 10 minutes, so it loses a lot of the value I am looking for. Won't be stoping by anymore for juice but I'll for sure be back from time to time for food.   They used to have great fresh baked goods (yummy banana chips) but they've added Tammy Coe which is a bummer because I can buy that anywhere these days.

They were stacking chairs and moving empty tables to prepare for end of day cleanup. (They close at 2pm in the summer). The manager was oblivious to what was going on. The food was not much better than the staff!! Go somewhere else!!!!",

So I ate it without, no biggie. The salad was okay. Not $16 worth, just okay.",

I've been here once before and while I thought the actual inside was beyond gorgeous, I wasn't wowed by the lavender latte that I had here (probably a year a go) and just never came back. I also don't really enjoy the parking lot right there on the corner, but nothing you can do about that.  This time I decided to go for the cold brew, and I didn't do the mamas cold brew, because that to me has too much cinnamon, and is kind of overpowering. I got the one chestnut makes in house, and it didn't even need creamer or sugar! I also got a delicious maple scone that I'm day dreaming about. Also, if you get the chestnut cold brew you get free refills!   I will say I haven't tried much of the food but I will be back for it!",

The kale was everywhere I couldn't even see my toast and the salmon was salty from a can.  My boyfriend ordered The Jam and his side potatoes were stale and super salty.  Nobody came back to ask us if everything looks ok or if we need anything else. And they were not even busy.  Such a disappointing experience.  Later Edit: Thank you Kirsten for taking the time to address my complain.  I don't have a problem where the salmon is coming from I have a problem with the presentation. The food just didn't look good everything was just a pile of kale with cold fish.  And those side potatoes were not cooked on the spot. I know you don't have servers but you definitely have cooks that don't care that much.",

Hipster cashier overcharges me and I ask why and he shows me the written menu with new prices (it was 50 cents more now). Cashier turns to manager, who is wearing black nail polish, and says we need to change the menu board prices. Nail polish boy doesn't say anything to me or cashier and keeps eating his soup. Normally, this is where I go off on anybody in sight, but I let it go cause I wanted to try this Billy Club. It was pretty good, but the bread needed to be softer for easier biting. All the ingredients were fairy high level including real turkey.     Obviously you cannot change your written prices and \"forget\" to change the menu board that 100% of people are actually looking at to order. Throw in the fact that a dude was wearing nail polish and I will find another turkey sandwich somewhere else where the employees and management aren't this lazy and inept.  UPDATE to Owner Response 2/1/16 I wasn't there on a Sunday. It was during the week. Plus your flat out lying. You have been open since at least 2014, so your telling me that the menu board prices have been wrong since you opened the doors? Cmon, if that's True then yes you are lazy and inept.",

It is completely incompetent to have employees that have no clue what is in the food and tell customers False info. On their ramen menu they have listed an egg and a soy egg. I told the waiter I'm vegan and he said the soy egg was made from tofu and water. Then I try it and I call the waiter over and say OMG what is this egg made of? He said don't worry and reassures me it's made from tofu and is vegan. Then I take another bite and ask him wow how do you get the yolk like that, then the manager hears me and says it's a real egg dipped in soy sauce! I have not eaten an egg in over 8 years for many reasons and yes they comped our meal but that does not make up for in any way that they violated my beliefs. I can't imagine if someone had allergies as they are clueless. They need to fix their menu so it is clear.  So they made me another bowl and I have to say it did not have any flavor. So if you're looking for good ramen this is NOT the place for you.   Never again.",

Very trendy and happening place with loud music.   The decor is very simple but quaint and not a very large dining area. The parking is a little awkward to get in and out  The food has very nice concepts but misses the mark on taste and flavor. Shared the banana bread pancakes and lobster roll. The banana bread pancakes had pretty good taste but the syrup was terrible in taste. The lobster roll was pretty good but for $16.00 was questionable whether was worth it. The housemaid chips that accompany the meal looked better then they tasted. Most of the dishes are fairly simple but the ones that we had just did not hit the mark.  Probably will not come back with all the restaurants in the area that are so good.",

Chestnut Fine Foods & Provisions has actually been open just over a month to date, but I waited a couple of weeks to check it out... and while I've been in only a few times so far, I will definitely be returning... and likely soon.  They carry Cartel coffee and MJ bread, and Camelback Flower Shop is conveniently located in the same building.  During my visits, I sampled the Lobster Cobb Salad, the Bruce Lee, a blueberry muffin, and the Apple Apple (apple and pineapple juice).  Additional Pros: *clean and bright ambiance with yellows and whites, flowers, and more *free wifi *friendly staff *kids area with a chalkboard, table, markers and paper + a great kids menu for both breakfast and dinner *a spacious outdoor dining area *a variety of options on the menu from fresh squeezed juices and pastries, sandwiches and salads *open daily 7am -7pm *spacious and clean restrooms  Things to work on / keep in mind: -they were out of \"It's Not Easy Being Green,\" the special kids' juice that I wanted to order for my son when I was there -it's kind of funky with parking unless you're heading south on 44th street and pull into their entrance prior to hitting Camelback -- when I go, I am usually heading west on Camelback and end up having to park at the office complex next door -- on their website, it says they have complimentary valet though! -the menu is diverse but kind of limited; they do not carry omelettes (egg whites or otherwise); I'm hoping they change this in the future!  Whether you head in for a cup of coffee or juice, a pastry, or a more substantial meal, and no matter if you're solo or meeting a friend or dining with a group, Chestnut is a comfortable new addition to the 'hood.",

Many people have complained on here about the service, but I have always had good service. In the mornings this is a counter service place--so you place your order at the counter and then it arrives at your table--I don't expect the same sort of service from counter restaurants as from table-service restaurants, so I think there is an issue with expectations from some patrons.  Last night, we tried out Water Chestnut--Thurs-Sat nights from 5pm to close. Both my girls got the Kid's Ramen bowls (very reasonably priced), and I had the Ramen--we all really enjoyed it. The BBQ pork was excellent, my nori, veggies, fish cake were perfect. The service was great--they left a little carafe of water at the table which I really appreciated. For dessert, we had matcha green tea ice cream (from Sweet Republic!!--another of my favorites) with a little sesame bun on the side that was really great. We will definitely come back for more ramen.",

I believe that those lowly reviews were given a little too prematurely considering the place just opened.   When we arrived, we were pleasantly greeted by staff. I got a green goddess salad and a gardener juice. The veggies were freshly cut and tasted robust. My husband ordered the lobster cobb salad that he enjoyed. His daughters got the chestnut chopped salad that tasted delicious. All our salads just had the right amount of dressing allowing you to taste the freshness of the organic ingredients.  Seating is quite limited inside but they do have several tables at their patio area. They also have a flower shop in the restaurant. Before we left we ordered chocolate chip cookies to go after hearing how good they were. They were not greasy and a great munchy ;) please check my photos for ingredients of our salads. You will want to try their food out after viewing them. Give them a chance. These little places serving healthy meals are quite beneficial to the community and bad reviews could cause a loss in business that not only hurt business owners but employees as well. Please check them out yourselves before forming an opinion although I would stay away from anything with the English muffin that had been consistently bashed.

    "text": "Unfortunate experience overall...  -Waited about 10 minutes for service. One man who wasn't our server brought us waters, said our waitress would be right over, and no one asked us if we had been helped otherwise, or even looked at us. Maybe 5 tables in the entire building.   -No apologies from our awkward waitress. Jumped right into the ordering. Seemed to know nothing about the menu. When I ordered a Beer by its name, she seemed confused. So I had to verbalize \"IPA\" and clarify what I asked for. It doesn't help for her that the traffic is so loud at night. Didn't seem to know a single thing about the food either.  (Small menu... management isn't doing their part to make sure the staff knows the simplest things.)  -Late food. On the apps, there are flash fried beef pot stickers and steamed veggie stickers. When I asked for \"one order of each, the veggie and the beef potstickers\" I must have confused her. Had to explain that too, three or four times, and when they arrived, they were both steamed. Both disappointing in quality, and came AFTER our dinner.   - Food quality of the ramen, soba, AND egg noodles... I hate sounding rude but my top ramen creations at home are way better and a little cheaper.   - A kind but also strange interaction with a cook after everything was finished. I really appreciate her trying to improve the experience and get feedback, but she was also not helping the cause after a few minutes. Good for her for trying, though! Just wanted to leave at this point and had to ask for the check a couple of times.   -Desert was poor, but that's just personal taste. Green tea ice cream and a little sesame friend ball thingy. Waitress didn't know what it was either lol.  -Little things. Bus tub set on our table, gross. Paid $1 or $2 for cabbage and got a single small leaf?! And all the condiments still had original lids that you had to peel off. Nice that they're new, not nice having to unscrew and recap everything.",

The restaurant is very cutely decorated and the counter service was friendly. I got the short rib hash and the husband got the pancakes. We both had coffee. The price was pretty expensive... about 30$. The pancakes were flavorless.... like chewing a pile of nothingness... I would not recommend them at all. The hash was alright... the veggies were fine, but the short rib was in huge chunks and wasn't very tender. The whole thing wasn't seasoned and needed sriracha to make it palatable. Even then, it was nothing special. We also got to try a couple cookies and a muffin, all of which were fine, but not great. Coffee was good. Overall, it was not a place I would go back to necessarily, but it gets points for decor and service....",

I had the lobster salad yesterday and asked for the egg to be left out due to me not liking egg, but then they left out the corn! The corn is one of the most important ingredients.  I didn't go to the counter and mention it as I was with a friend and a small child. Also my lobster was overcooked which is sad for a salad.  As we left my friend mentioned her salad was missing the nuts,  so I knew that I needed to review.  Owners if you are reading this time to go wake up or shake up your salad person.   The last time I was there same thing happened with my quinoa salad- ingredients missing.",

The owner or chef or anyone working there must not have ever tried this boring disaster of a salad.  We saw a few of them remain uneaten as well as ours.  The thing is you would think that the bus boy/diswasher  might let the cook know...but the fact is no one at this place cares.  At the end were were going to get some baked goods and the line was long...we feel bad for those who ate there...but we were spared a weak dessert experience I'm sure.",

Also, the service was fine - patient and kind - even amidst some VERY rude women with kids who sent the children's food back because the toast wasn't crispy enough..  That being said, I ordered the chopped salad with mixed greens and romaine I believe. The mixed greens were not just old, they were decomposing. Mushy and falling apart. Smelled terrible. This really irks me when you're paying $13 for a high-quality salad. I'm disappointed the chef didn't care enough to check what he puts on the plate. Otherwise, it would have been a great salad! I'm not that picky, but a lazy chef who doesn't care about food quality before the plate goes out is a bad sign.",

We walked in to and almost empty resto after first trying to get into a packed Flour Child. We thought we found a hidden jewel.  Waiting in the single register line for nearly 20 minutes behind 4 other people (one single + 1 group of 3) was ridiculous.  We tried to give benefit of the doubt - thinking our fellow diners were (perhaps) being difficult. Nope!  The wait sucked.  Pricing was high.  Food was good.   So, my summary, I won't be back. With so many other faster, better fast casual restos in Arcadia (paradise bakery, wildflower, anything at the Biltmore) this place has got to pick up it's game or it will be just another short-lived place that changes names 1,000 times.

I have been working from Chestnut 2-3 times a month for at least a year. It's a beautiful build out and on nice days the windows are open to their patio making this a great spot to catch up on work. Last week when I worked there, I sat down at a table and there were papers crumpled up from straws and napkins. It'd be fine if it was post lunch or had been busy but it was only 7:30am and they had only been open for thirty minutes. That made me think they had not washed down the tables the night before. Then, to top it off, there was a hair in my granola bowl. Mistakes happen but to have two questionable cleanliness items happen in one visit, was gross and unfortunate. This morning I ate breakfast before going to avoid another hairy incident but was excited for a good hot cup of coffee and a productive morning. When I got to the counter, they told me they were out of regular coffee. I could only have decaf or an Americano. It was again 7am, so it wasn't like they had a mad rush and ran out of coffee. I opted for a cold brew and sat down. I spent 5 minutes trying to connect to their internet and finally asked if they were having issues. The employee said yes, they've had issues for a few days. All a girl needs is a clean place, with a hot cup of coffee and internet to work. Sad to see such a great spot become blah.",

The blueberry scone/cake thing was absolutely rubbery and tasteless. No flavor. The shortbread cookie with pistachios was also lacking any distinct flavor. I ordered a small maple oat scone, which was at least edible but, please- for the love of God- hire a new baker!! It is NOT hard to bake. I'd rather waste my calories at LA Grande Orange down the street.   My friend ordered the tofu bahn mi which was pretty delicious. It came with sweet posts to chips which were good.

It is certainly your job to take the money and make sure that the restaurant gets paid,why isn't it your job to be sure that the customer gets what they pay for?

This time had the brussel sprout salad - LOVED IT - if you are a sprout eater, get this! It is as advertised. All brussels and no filler, which you find with so many brussel salads and always disappoints. Not at Chestnut!!   Awesome on a plate. Couldn't wait to dig in before taking the photo shared here. Yum!   FIRST REVIEW First, the space - so inviting, warm and full of charm.  Second, the service - happy staff, very helpful in answering our many questions, and anxious to hear our feedback.  Third, the food - Fantastically delicious! We had the ricotta waffles, chicken and waffles and the pop tart. Plus amazing and fresh grapefruit juice. Would have all of it again but really can't wait to try something new next time.",

    "text": "Chestnut, you can thank Total Divas or The Bellas for having us come to the establishment today because well, I've watched the show and Chestnut has been featured on the show a few times. Honestly, I've already had my first choice for brunch this morning, but my first choice had a freaken line out the damn door so I had to find somewhere else to go. My second choice was closed on President's Day - ugh... So we started heading east on Camelback and I thought, \"Why not Chestnut? Never been there before..\"  The parking situation is a complete cluster... One way in and not an easy way in and one way out. The establishment is surrounded by professional/medical businesses and I can see how it can be a nuisance during peak hours.   When we finally make our way in, we are greeted to the front counter where you order and get a number (think Sauce). Luckily, I checked Yelp reviews to help me order and so we decided on the Sandi sandwich with prosciutto and the Lemon Ricotta waffle. I also got the lavender green tea for a drink.   We sat down and it was a beautiful day. Their patio looked out to the busy street on Camelback and they opened the doors so the fresh breeze came in. There aren't very many tables but it wasn't very busy, thank god, so we snagged a table with no problem.   We got our order rather quickly and the Sandi sandwich was ok. The lemon ricotta waffle was delicious and I highly recommend it. The tea was eh - I never was impressed with drinks that have \"lavender\" in it. Total of our bill: $20 with some change.   Overall, because there was no wait, our food came to us rather quickly, the day was beautiful, our bill wasn't expensive, and I'm in a good mood, I give them four stars. I wouldn't come here for lunch though on a weekday.",

From their homemade cold brew to delicious breakfast to their bright, eclectic atmosphere (including cute, local goods to purchase) this place has it all!   My favorite is their lemon ricotta blueberry waffles. They're fresh, fruity, and not too heavy! I love grabbing a seat by the window and soaking up the sun while I wait for my food. I also love to order the honey lavender latte - it's so tasty! My friends love their quinoa bowls and banana bread pancakes as well.   The atmosphere of this place really knocks it out of the park. It's like a beautiful, bright farmers market in there. The service is fantastic as well. Once, when my order was mistaken, they not only brought me my correct order, but gave me a comp for my next time in! They will go above and beyond to make sure your experience is the best.   Be sure to grab some cold brew and a treat on your way out!",

Since she has never steered me down the wrong path before, I accepted. It is easy to find and on the weekend there is plenty of parking. Great location, but during the week you may have trouble parking at busy times. Plan ahead. Worth the effort.  The menu is extensive and varied . . . in other words, I had trouble making up my mind. Everything sounded yummy. Once that was settled and we sat down for our catch-up time, I truly enjoyed the atmosphere and the items I had selected: Small G.O.C., 1/2 fruit salad & a mixed berry scone.   There is a small \"antique\" shop where you can purchase unique kitchen items. There is a guest table right in the center where you can submerse you & friends in another era, but with all the good treats that Chestnut has to offer.   A must return. I want to try other items on the menu. Recommended: The lobster salad. OMGoodness! I can hardly wait.",

I ordered an egg sandwich since there weren't any vegetarian/vegan \"meats\" They did offer me to sub another egg, which I was totally fine with. I ordered to go. When I got the sandwich the bun was pretty much a seedless hamburger bun. Heavy and not breakfasty at all. The sandwich seemed thrown in there and a mess. One egg wasn't in the sandwich, it had adhered to the paper, then busted as I tried to load it on the bun. The eggs were watery and undercooked. There was mayo as a sauce--MEH! Good amount of spinach and tomatoes though. Sandwich was lackluster at best. Would not order this sandwich again. The blueberry pop tarts looked delicious!!",

Decor is very modern, lots of natural light with ceiling to floor windows replacing walls. Indie music plays somewhat louder than the average cafe. Patrons are mostly 30 something's and older, wealthy Scottsdaleans.   Food:  I went with the Granger and was pleasantly surprised. The salmon was perfect, not dried out. The poached Eggs could have been pulled out sooner but I'm a egg snob. The best part was the sauteed kale, WOW. I could eat that all day. The avocado/tomatoes were great as well. I had a fresh squeezed OJ which was worth the price. The toast was ok but prob not worth the extra 1.50.  Price/Service: Definitely expensive but you are paying for quality foods, hard to gauge but I would say it overall was worth the price. Food came out quick, so no complaints.  Overall: A great spot if you're abreakfast snob....Also a great post-Echo Canyon hike Breakfast spot.",

    "text": "Chestnut has potential to be amazing, unfortunately my experience was mediocre at best.   I have been wanting to go to Chestnut for the past year but rarely make it past 32nd st on Camelback. Why? I'm not too sure. Either way, I made a mental note to make this my destination for today.   The decor is beautiful. I love the yellow and grey. Not only are the colors bright but there is a ton of natural light. The center of the restaurant is the coffee bar/baked goods/regular bar/juice bar, and there is seating on the far side.  My lady and I each ordered a sandwich, grilled cheese for me, some sort of club for her and we each ordered the lemonade. I asked for bacon on the grilled cheese but it came without so I double checked to make sure I hadn't been charged. The guy who took our order didn't hear me order it I guess, therefore he didn't charge me for it. The grilled cheese does come with tomato on it. It was small, but delicious. The club was descent but nothing to get excited over. Best part of the sandwich was the Noble bread. As for the lemonade, way too tart.  After we ate we ordered a couple baked goods, a snickerdoodle for me and a pecan bar for her. They were also just ok. While she was up at the counter ordering, I was watching what was going on in the bar area and what I could see in the kitchen. I watched the guy who was making juice, grab a glove out of a mason jar. Thought it was kind of odd but figured they did that for decor purposes. Later I saw one of the employees filling it with gloves, but not wearing any while doing it. Kind of kills the purpose, don't you think?  I doubt I will return. I came, I saw, I conquered, and I left disappointed. It's a great spot but nothing to get excited over.",

I have to say Chestnut is a cute shop, I like the open feel of it, and the staff is real friendly and helpful. And they make a great tasting Mocha!   I went with the weekend special, it was the short rib hash with 2 over easy eggs. In theory this dish would have rocked, but in reality it was a texture thing that was a little off.  The onions were twice the size of the potatoes, the meat of the short rib looked like it was just ripped of the bone and tossed in with potatoes, just all chucky, I guess I like my hash to be equal in size haha. The flavoring was great though, so I got over the size textures sort of quickly.  Over all Chestnut is a cute little place and glad I finally got to try them out",

They have a build-your-own type style where you can choose the broth, type of noodle, protein and toppings. Both times I've had the Chinese sausage with garlic shoyu, soft egg, & nori and it was awesome! The sausage, while not a traditional ingredient is sweet and savory and adds a nice amount of flavor. I find the portions size to be decent, I haven't been able to finish. Their craft cocktails are also very inventive with fresh ingredients. While my husband and I were finishing our dinner the chef came out to ask how everything was, she then told us that everything is homemade including the dumpling skins. We will definitely have to come back and try some of the smaller bites next time.",

I have been here before, several months apart, and had poor service and mediocre food but it is SO CLOSE to my house. I really want to like it. However, today was the last straw: an uncooked chocolate croissant. When I picked it up I was surprised at how heavy and dense it felt. After biting, the cause was revealed to be raw dough. I can't even bring myself to return it because the dude at the counter had such a bad attitude and that was just when I was ordering. Ok so I learned my lesson, I won't be back.",

Ordered banana pancakes instead and was told only after we sat down and had been waiting over ten minutes that there would be a longer wait since they've ran out of pancake batter. 30 min later they brought them out! I normally would have just cancelled the order but I hadn't tried the restaurant out yet and was curious. When they appeared, there were two small pancakes. $8 for two small pancakes and some bacon. Lame. They could have apologized or say hey, pancakes are on us but it didn't appear they we're phased by keeping a customer waiting 40 minutes and not apologize?  The food over all was good but not worth the wait. Coffee isn't that great. My friend and I thought it tasted sweet and odd.",

    "text": "I've been to Chestnut several times now as I really love the location, quality ingredients and concept.  The decor in and out is cheery.  Seeing the patio diners from Camelback is really inviting.  They have a lot of nearby competition though and I think at the very least, they should adjust two things fast while they still have people's attention:  Flavor and prices.  The Sandi with turkey was very bland.  The english muffin wasn't toasted, and just lacked overall flavor.  It was also $10.  That's over $2 more than LGO's commuter which is delicious and flavorful.  Kale salad with chicken was a whopping $17!!  WHAT??  I made the mistake of not specifying small or large, and the cashier just selected large for me.  The price of adding chicken isn't listed on the menu, but it's $4.95!  I realize they have to pay the rent, but at these prices they won't be selling a lot of salads.  Other nearby competitors provide GREAT kale salads without protein for $8-9, add protein for $3.  The salad is also bland to boot.  They use qualilty ingredients here, I think the kitchen just needs work.  Baked oatmeal was delicious!  Grilled cheese was just ok, nothing special.  We asked for it on sourdough.  The cashier just took the order, but didn't bother to tell us they don't have sourdough.   Bacon is thick, maple glazed and delicous.  They don't have any low-carb breakfast menu options but recently had an egg white, turkey hash, spinich special.  I was excited they were testing out a low carb option. However, it was too \"deconstructed.\"  Nothing pulled the dish together.  The turkey has was flavorful but dry. It was set atop scrambled egg whites that topped raw spinich.  I guess I expected the spinich to be steamed.  I felt like I was eating egg whites on a salad.  The bacon was the best part of this dish.  I haven't had a veggie juice there, but I'm glad they offer it.  Madison Improvement Club does fresh 16oz juice for $7, not $10.    They don't list menu prices of coffee, tea, muffins, or adding chicken to salads.  For lunch one day we ordered: soup, grilled cheese, kale salad with chicken, strawberry muffin, regular coffee, regular tea and it totaled $47 and this is a place without table service!  Our friends in the neighborhood share our sentiments about it being too pricey, and we are people that eat at quality establishments regularly.  I think they better adjust some prices if they want regular, repeat diners and referrals.  The service staff is very friendly, but I think the cashiers should be better trained to distill down on questions like, large or small, we don't carry sourdough, etc..  I was also there on a day when one of the owners snapped at her mother.  I was shocked, but I understand you might say things to your mother that you wouldn't say to other people.  But you are also not standing in your kitchen at home.  You are in the public eye.  Be nice!  This place could hit it out of the park with their location, healthy food philosophy and quality ingredients; but I think they better start putting out comment cards for people to fill out so they get a handle on what people really think before it's too late.  I already don't feel like going back because the food I've had isn't craveable, but I will because I hope they improve, I'll try other menu items, and I want them to survive after all the time, effort, and money they have invested.  I think they can make Fox envy their location, but they need to put out delicous dishes at competitive prices.",

    "text": "The Arcadia neighborhood needed some new brunch spots, and Chestnut has claimed a prominent spot in my brunch & coffee neighborhood rotation (disclaimer: I am not a fan of The Henry due to dismal service and lackluster food). It is also a great place for casual working breakfasts/lunches with colleagues.   Fantastic coffee (coffee beans supplied by Cartel, which is rare to find in this area), with the Honey Lavender Latte rating as my favorite coffee beverage in the neighborhood these days. Manny, the primary barista, is very friendly and talkative - and makes delicious coffees. The juices are also great, I have been ordering the Bruce Lee (with Cayenne pepper) a lot recently to help fend off the cold and flu that has been circulating in the Valley.   The food is delicious, with interesting new renditions of old classics and fantastic innovations, adding a spicy asian twist to some dishes. The names of the dishes are also very fun. I usually order brunch regardless of the time of day -- the waffles and pancakes are both terrific, and the Sandi with Bacon is always a go to item for a savory brunch craving. And if you see the strawberry muffins, definitely try one. They don't appear daily and they are delicious. For lunch, the lobster roll is fantastic.   Two sisters own the place and are frequently seen walking around, saying hi to their customers. They are very nice and always greet me and my friends that I bring here. They did a fantastic job with the design, the place is very bright and airy with warm colors and inviting decor. It is a great place to have a few coffees and work at the bar for a few hours.   Regarding some of the negative comments -- are there issues that can yield problematic dining experiences? Yes there can be. It is still a new place working out the kinks and service sometimes suffers as a result. While it has never happened to me personally, I have seen it happen to other diners around me. However in my experience the staff always works to rectify errors if you explain the problem and give them the chance.   They will be opening happy hour in the next few weeks and I look forward to seeing their wine list and drink concoctions when they debut!",

We picked out and ordered our meals along with a large latte. While waiting we wondered through this little gift shop area they have of cute antiques and decorating things, it really is super cute. We grabbed seats on the outdoor patio and waited for our food and coffee. The young man who took our order came out and said their espresso machine wasn't working and asked what else I'd want to drink. Ok things happen however I think he should've come out refund in hand and then offered a complimentary drink of my choice. I don't drink regular drip coffee as it upsets my stomach so I was left without an option. Our food came out and the first thing I noticed was my husbands hash didn't look very appealing, the meat to me almost had a greenish color to it. He said the meat was rubbery, the eggs were sunny side up not over easy and the dish itself was full of grease at the bottom. I ordered the lemon ricotta waffles and they were so overcooked you couldn't even taste the lemon over the burnt taste. I tried to eat them because I hadn't eaten all night but they weren't very appetizing so I had to stop. I definitely won't be back because not one thing about the whole experience was right, meals we couldn't eat and a coffee we never got. It was so disappointing. We did get a full refund. It's really unfortunate because the inside is so cute and they've got great patio seating. We really loved the space.",

He said it was so hot from the fresh jalapenos that a rare few would be able to eat it. I had a prosciutto brie frischece or something. Nothing exciting going on there.   We sat at a table that wobbled, thought about moving to the next but it wobbled too. The cushion was terribly dirty. There were crumbs and stains.

It's been a while as I felt it was overpriced for a breakfast/lunch place, but this was before they began the Ramen dinner concept. I can't speak to the ambiance. I had my dinner delivered by Uber Eats. The food on the other hand, surpassed my expectations. I had the flash fried beef pot stickers, short rib bao steamed buns, egg rolls with plum sauce and mango sticky rice. The pot stickers (3 to an order) were cooked perfectly and the sauce was flavorful with the just the right saltiness. The short rib bao steamed buns (3 to an order)... Yum! The buns were light and fluffy. The beef was seasoned and cooked well. The egg rolls (also 3 to an order) were very tasty and the plum sauce was clearly made in-house. Not too sweet but very flavorful. Lastly, the mango sticky rice. Light and delicious! Total was around $30 for all of the above, although Uber adds a small percentage. Will definitely order from here again!",

The coffee service on the other hand... not the best. I've waited over 20 minutes for coffee on more than one occasion, I didn't mind so much because I work so close and it would have been the same amount of time if I were to drive else where for coffee. What really irked me was today, I walked over there for a coffee at 2:00pm and the girl working the coffee stations refused to make me anything because they closed at 2pm. When I last looked, they closed at 4pm. I would have been okay with it, but the cashier was extremely rude towards me and there was someone ahead of me and she took her order, but not mine. I understand hours of operations may change, but if she was polite about it, I would have been a little more understanding.",

One, the flower shop was closed, not sure that makes any sense on a weekend. I love the Camelback Flower Shop, but they really should be open on Sundays at Chestnut. Second, and this is my reason for the 2 stars, the service is horrible here. With only 2 of us in line how can ordering and receiving a latte take 20 minutes. The staff runs around like they're lost and there is no communication. Employees would rather talk to each other than acknowledge they have a customer waiting to order. I really don't think I will ever go here again. Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.",

I struggled through that because I wanted to try the place.  The menu is pretty lean, but decent options.  You order and then go sit and wait for your food to be delivered to your table.  Food came out quickly.  I had their version of a club sandwich.  The turkey abs bacon were good.  The bread was a bird's delight, but too seedy for me. The tomatoes were blah.  It was served with house made sweet potato chips.  They were oily and most were not crisp.  I also received a small cup of cut cucumber in vinegar.  Hmm?  Traffic noise is intense and not a place you want to have a semi private conversion as you have to talk loudly to hear each other.  In fact, I thought about typing this in all caps so you could hear me over the traffic roar.   All in all, I would suggest going to one of the other nearby eateries. There are many options that have better food, easy access and a pleasant atmosphere.",

I will still probably try them again though as I dream of the old ones sometime when i am craving some cookie action.    Went in here a few times just seems a little strange, did look over to the right and noticed food all over the floor in the kitchen which seemed strange for such a place.  Saw a tasty looking loaf of coffee cake on the counter with no price marked, lady at the counter said embarrassingly, 32.00 dollars, and I put the cake back on the counter.  Never heard of such a thing.  We also got some muffins that seems like they needed help like the cookies.",

The blueberry pop tart was out of this world good. Our least favorite was the bibimbop since it had way too much kale and not enough quinoa for the price.

I'm looking at Camelback Mountain right now, not a nightclub DJ with side bangs. This is killing my chill, morning-ish vibe. If your poached eggs weren't so damn perfect, I'd leave. The person in charge of today's playlist must be the same person who convinced my mom to get a Panic! At the Disco CD the last time she went to a Best Buy.  *So I thought I'd update this in fairness, as someone reached out and mentioned they're always happy to change the music selection. Now I feel bad for being a music snob, but life is hard when you have good taste. They really do have perfect healthy breakfasts. Good enough to endure any music selection. I'm sorry.

    "text": "I specifically came here for their ramen menu that they started for the evenings on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. I was really confused why a breakfast and brunch place would start serving ramen at night. But the ramen wasn't that bad. It was a little small in portion in my opinion but the overall bowl was pretty good if not really good.  I would say they are competing for first place for best tasting ramen with the new Nishikawa location. I think Nishikawa has better and thicker broth (depending if you get the tonkatsu there) but their noodles are questionable. The ramen at Chestnut has better noodles as in actual ramen noodles even though you can get buckwheat noodles which I am not a fan of.  I would say I like the ramen I got which was the Garlic Pork Miso with regular ramen and a soft boiled egg. The egg was truly soft boiled because you can pop the yolk. The noodles were springy and didn't go soft after being in the broth. The broth had flavor and some depth to it... like they actually put more than seasoning into it. The bbq pork as a topping came out really well and complimented the flavor. Usually I expect pork slices that melt in your mouth but in this case, it was still very tasty. So I give this place a really good recommendation for pretty good ramen compared to other places in AZ.",

We wanted something light since we knew that we were going out for lunch and dinner also, and Chestnut provided just that.   I ordered The Sandi with prosciutto served on a pepper roll with an over easy egg, gruyere, arugula, and truffle aioli {this is what sold me!}. The bun was light and airy, and the sandwich was delicious. The only thing that I would have wished for was some fruit on the side. For $8 you get the sandi only and I didn't really want to pay extra for a side. I guess I didn't need it THAT bad. ;) I also had some of their mango iced tea which was refreshing and very flavorful!  My fiance got the baked oatmeal and loved it!!! Especially the cinnamon apple compote on top.  They also sell Mama's Cold Brew - YES, please! Since it is near my house, this is where i'll be buying it from now on! SO YUM!",

He quickly brought out the correct order. My BF ordered the breakfast burrito with bacon sausage and cheese after eating about half and finding no sausage he realized his order was wrong too.

The ricotta waffle was cut into four pieces. Two tasted ok, and two didn't. Not sure why there wasn't consistency. I would say the food was ok, but nothing I would make a special trip for.

Delicious cocktails and appetizers of steamed edamame prepared 3 different ways - we tried garlic and then the spicy chili. Both were just on point! Then we had the vegetarian potstickers and the spring rolls. We were fighting over them and ended up ordering 2 more plates! Get this - the plum sauce they are served with is homemade from actual plums. Not canned, fresh plums! For entrees, we had 2 different ramen dishes. OMG! Soooo good!!! 3 different broths, 3 different noodle choices, plenty of proteins (we had 1 duck and 1 tofu - I was the solo omnivore with 4 vegetarians and BONUS because I didn't have to share!), then lots of different additions like chili sweet corn, garlic spinach, and more! The owner and her mother checked on us and chatted with us to ensure we were happy diners. We learned about the different flavor compositions, how they enjoy what they do and their passion is completely evident in their food. You can seriously taste the love! Then we finished up with black sesame ice cream and some sweet little sesame and red bean paste orbs that were just unbelievable! We rolled ourselves out of there and were all super excited to have a new family  restaurant in the hood for DINNER!! Can't wait to return - one catch - dinner is only Thurs - Saturday - get it soon, you will be SO PLEASED YOU DID!!!",

Since it's in Arcadia, parking is a challenge of course, but there is a valet option. The atmosphere is lively and bright. You order at the counter and then you are given a number and your food is brought to you at your table. We sat outside which was nice but a little noisy since you're facing Camelback.    I had the lobster roll which is wonderful! As another reviewer mentioned, it is not the typical mayo-based lobster roll. There is a wonderful spicy remoulade which doesn't overpower the lobster and it's on a very good toasty baguette. The prickly pear iced tea is also very good.   My friend had the Ficelles which is the prosciutto and brie sandwich and she said it was \"just ok\".   We both agreed that the best part of the experience were the chocolate chip cookies, don't leave without indulging in one (or more) of those. I'll definitely be back to try some other items and to get more cookies!",

I thought this was a sit down restaurant for some reason but it's more set up like a Panera or Flower Child were you order and take a number to a table. That's fine, but why do they only have one cash register/cashier during brunch hours? Kind of a wonky way to run a restaurant that would obviously be busy on a weekend morning. I ordered, the hipster staff was friendly, food came out pretty quickly. It was yummy, simple food. This isn't the kind of brunch where you walk away hating yourself and clutching a food baby - it was filling and healthy in a way that made me feel good about myself and life choices in general. Probably because my eggs were topped with kale and salmon, not oozing with cheese. The plate was good in general except for the toast, which was.. Stale? I think? I couldn't cut it with my knife, whatever that means. Less carbs I guess. The other drawback was the price; I'd been warned by Yelpers beforehand so it wasn't a totally shock when I paid $15 for my breakfast and coffee. For that kind of price I would expect better quality things like bread and a less weird cashier set up. I'll come back, there are other things on the menu I'd like to try, but it'll have to be close to payday.",

Muffin just average and to top it off the guy taking orders at the counter was super cranky!! We won't be back! I'd much rather go to Le Grande Orange!!!  Kristen, yes all that you mentioned was missing from the fruit salad!  It was literally a bowl of 8 dollar pineapple. You can PM me if needed.",

Our food arrived with a strong fishy odor, the patrons at the next table actually cringed.  The lobster was stringy and clearly rotten.  We sent the food back and the manager came over to apologize.  I asked her if she tasted the lobster and she said no, she doesn't eat lobster.  She explained that the lobster is frozen, not fresh, because we aren't near an ocean.  Huh????  The manager offered to order us something else and refund the difference.  She also provided a gift card.  She handled it well.  I suggested to her that the chef should be checking the lobster before it is served as it has clearly been thawed and unused for days.  For $16 a plate I would have expected fresh lobster, the live version that is flown all over the country, something they seem not to know.  I will not return unless they upgrade their chefs.  They seem not to care that food is clearly rotten before serving it to customers.",

Our salads came back and they were very good size portions. I LOVED my Green Goddess Salad. It had some spice to it but the flavor was very good and I was happy that I had some noodles in every bite after mixing it all up. The service was good and everyone was friendly. I certainly will be back to try more things.",

When our meals finally arrived, they were both cold and had clearly been sitting out for a while; cold, hard scrambled eggs and salmon that was so cold, it had to have come straight from the refrigerator. Minimal service from staff-you order at the counter and they bring your food out to you. Definitely not worth the $30 spent; will never return here and would not recommend it to anyone.",

I had the breakfast bowl with quinoa, poached eggs, kale, and chili sauce ... it was delicious and had a nice spicy kick to it! My friend had the waffles, which looked amazing and yup they tasted amazing as well! I am not big on coffee but they serve Cartel coffee and teas. Their menu looks like a nice change from your typical breakfast/lunch spots. The staff was very friendly and helpful. As many of you mentioned, this is a new place ... I would suggest for you to grab a menu as soon as you walk in (next to cashier) as that will make it less confusing. I have high hopes for Chestnut and will definitely visit again soon!",

Our food arrived. All looked very good. And it was. Portion okay. Asked the young man that dropped off our food.... can we get silverware? He mumbled something and pointed. Uh.... okay... I get up and proceed to walk to the bar area. Find the roll ups.  Place was just kind of underwhelming.  For $35 for some breakfast food not sure if I'd return. No refills on ice tea. If there was.... that was not offered to us. And that is not self serve.  Did use the restroom. No toilet paper and no hand soap. It was only noon. Leads me to believe no one checks it. I did tell the very nice young lady that took our order and she did get right on it.  Too many great places in Arcadia to go back. Sorry.",

The first issue I had was that the gentleman who took my order was not very friendly to me or my guest who is there for the first time.. Kind of had a no so friendly attitude.  2. Then the same guy Ask me if I could go into a room where they would shut the door so I wouldn't disturb anybody with my service animal. This is super shocking considering all people want to do is take photos of the dog. He's well behaved and incredibly friendly. This guy definitely was not a dog lover. Maybe a cat guy?!   3. Finally the dish I ordered Is supposed to come with 2 poached runny egg instead it was practically parked boil.   Just a real disappointment over all today. I have no problem paying premium prices i.e. seven dollars with tip for a latte however with those kind of prices I expect a certain level of treatment and quality food....   #appreciateyourcustomers #serviceiseverything  I will probably not be back for a while but maybe at some point I will give it another shot.",

If I'm in the area next time, I'll be sure to check it out!",

We started off with the Short Rib Bao - normally, Bao is a steamed bun, but these were served taco-style - either way, they were tasty!  Good way to get your meal off to a rockin' start!  On to the Ramen - First, you choose your broth (Pork Shoyu for me), then a noodle (house ramen), then protein (bbq pork) then add-ins (spicy sesame chili sweet corn and a soft egg).  The broth was pretty good, and the noodles were cooked properly.  The pork was good and the egg was perfect (my daughter went with the soy egg, which is hard boiled, but she thought the soy overpowered the egg).    It was a good bowl of ramen.    We enjoyed our dinner, and will head back some time soon!!",

Given that the intersection at 44th St. and Camelback is one of the most trafficked areas in Phoenix I think this place has a good shot at doing well.    I will stop back by and review my post after the next experience.",

Upscale enough to show that I care and have good taste, but casual enough to avoid pretension.  The food is clever, diverse, and consistently excellent.  The bloody mary excels through simplicity.  The coffee is both thoughtfully chosen and well brewed.  Ordering is done at the cash register, and comes with friendly service.  The flower shop is an interesting store-within-a-store and a feast for the eyes.  If you have the occasion to speak to the owner (or one of the owners, perhaps?), consider yourself lucky.

The service at the counter wasn't super friendly but it was prompt and courteous. We met the owner on our way out, she was very friendly and chatted with us for a few minutes.

    "text": "I'm no longer a fan of this cafe and here is why: I needed to get some flowers for my wife yesterday afternoon. It was one of those \"I should probably get her flowers.\" moments where husbands sometimes find themselves.  Previously, we had eaten at Chestnut and browsed in Camelback Flowershop which is located inside the cafe. The woman working there that day was friendly and gave my wife their card and had hand written on it that on Fridays from 1-6pm they offer \"Fresh Flower Happy Hour\". It just so happened to be Friday afternoon that I needed to buy a bouquet. I didn't have our car that day, and called my friend to come pick me up and drive me over to the store. We arrived at 445pm. Chestnut closes in the early afternoon so of course the door was locked but I imagined their would some way to access the flower shop therein. We tried all the doors: all locked. I called the flower shop: no answer but the voicemail message said they were open at that time. I could see about 3 adults behind the bar inside Chestnut milling around, one was clearly staff cleaning, but the others looked like possibly owners/management. Someone's child was just inside the door playing with toys. I knocked, and the adults were clearly doing their best to not make eye contact because I was the dumb customer who clearly didn't know how to read the hours of operation sign. I KNEW they were closed I just wanted to find out why I couldn't get into the flower shop that was supposed to be open. We went around to the patio door and I mimed to them that I was trying to buy flowers. They looked away perturbed.  So here's the thing: there are many flower shops in Phoenix. There are also a million places to eat in this area. But by not being open during advertised hours and not posting a sign or leaving an outgoing voicemail on the service with an explanation as to why I can't do business at CBFS during their clearly posted business hours, this shop has failed me as a potential repeat client. I understand life happens, emergencies arise, but it takes seconds to jot a note and stick it in the window: \"Sorry we had to close early today. Please come again! :)\"  Chestnut failed because there I was standing there in 110 degree heat being made a fool of. Would it have KILLED the Chestnut people to come over, open the door and tell me why the flower shop is not open? Was it really necessary for me to stand there looking at them ignoring me, a former customer? Customer service is a dying art and is common courtesy apparently. I'm more disappointed in the Chestnut people as they were THERE.  But I will tell you: the flowers I bought at Safeway are beautiful, and neither I nor my friend will ever spend any money at Chestnut again. Which is too bad cuz it's close to home and has decent food. But so will the new Matt's Big Breakfast opening soon at the Safeway mall at 32nd St. where I will be able to get brunch and flowers in the future.",

The pastries are good, especially the pecan bar and cookies (more so than the muffins and scones). The decor is really nice; it feels light, airy, and casual. They even have a little kids' corner. They have healthy and delicious options, and great kids' options too.  The two reasons I can't give it five stars are easy to fix: 1) There is no decaf espresso, which is SO weird and kind of makes it a deal breaker for me as a coffee/morning place. 2) They moved the kid area over by the register where there are no normal tables, so you can't sit near your kids while they play. There is one high-top table, but that doesn't work if you have a baby in a high chair, or if you have to get down to discipline/help your kids, and obviously kids can't sit there. Very strange.",

    "text": "Today was the official opening of Chestnut. I meet some friends for lunch. When you walk into the big open space, you order at the counter, receive a number and find a table. Our drinks (green tea) were delivered promptly.  I ordered the Green Goddess salad that had rice noodles, kale, swiss chard, cashews, toasted coconut and a spicy Asian dressing. It only took about 5-10 min to receive our food and the service was always with a smile. The salad was very good...maybe better if they would have had more greens and less noodles, but still light and delicious. My friends ordered the Chestnut Chop salad which looked good and the Lobster Roll, which looked AMAZING. This is not the mayo-loaded-gut-bomb you have come to expect from lobster rolls. I didn't even see any mayo. I can't tell you about the taste because my friend refused to give up one bite and finished the whole thing! lol  The patio is great. There is an adorable flower shop inside as well.   Welcome to the neighborhood Chestnut, you will be seeing a lot of me!",

The silverware was low end.  Forks were easily bent. We sat outside on Camelback Rd side and no one was out there to wipe off tables and pick up napkins off the ground. I really wanted this to be a good experience as its a great location.   I would blame management for lack of supervision.  Not enough staff during peak hours. Banana bread pancakes were excellent.",

    "text": "Ok, let me just start out by saying that the best tuna sandwich in town is here (you get the choice of hot or cold! Who does that?!). Not to say that reason alone is the only thing you should look for here. Quite the contrary. The treats (scones, muffins, cookies, and more) are tastebud-meltingly amazing. Full choice of breakfast selections, smoothies, juices, and sandwiches-all able to satisfy the super health conscious and those in to let their cravings run wild. The coffee is also top notch and would eat Starbucks' for lunch (or breakfast.lol) given a head to head confrontation.   That would almost be enough to justify that I did my part in sharing with my fellow local Arizona restaurant fans the gift that this place is for us who live here-but it's not! Reason being, I would be forgetting to mention how friendly the staff is here and great the service is. Expect to feel welcome when you come in, and unfortunately, that is not the case in most restaurants nowadays.   Next, this place looks hip, has a very clean and modern look, which you can see from the minimalist design of the menus, to the touchscreen pad up front where you can key in your phone number for specials; it is immediately impressed upon you that quality is important to the owners here.  That is further confirmed for when you try the food. :) Ingredients make the difference, and you get what you pay for here.   Lastly, there are really comfortable seating arrangements here: different types of chairs inside, so that you can relax outside, lounge on some of the soft seats inside, or sit up at the bar on the stools. Either way yields more than enough comfort to suit your mood; whether you are staying for a while or on the go, there is no way to go wrong.     I will be back. A LOT. Hope you will get to enjoy also! :)",

I had a huge kale salad with pine nuts, romano cheese and dried currants. It was fresh and I thought it was a unique offering. Drank a cup of great coffee (from Cartel, I believe) and thoroughly enjoyed my Bruce Lee juice (carrot, ginger... Plus some other stuff).   Parking was no problem and they have a nice, albeit very noisy, patio seating area. Staff was prompt, knowledgable and courteous. Prices are in the higher end of the range for lunch, but really about the same as other restaurants of similar caliber.   I would definitely return and recommend to friends.",

They do a great job with their marketing and design but the food is just simply not up to par. The ingredients are quality; arrangement is mediocre. The green eggs and ham is an open faced sandwich with prosciutto, arugula, a poached egg smothered with pesto on top. The Prosciutto was overwhelming and was the only thing you could really taste. I am a huge fan of eggs Benedict and figured that this meal would be like eggs Benedict sub Benedict sauce for pesto... Boy was I wrong. Poached eggs are usually soft but this one was a little overcooked. I would've also chosen a different bread, maybe something with more of a texture or crunch. The pesto was super oily and did not add anything new except what tasted like an excess of sodium when combined with the prosciutto. Overall, I'm highly disappointed by the lack of flavor profile...this could have been so good.",

    "text": "What a disappointment.   Now, I held off writing a review after a horrible first experience thinking that Chestnut had potential.   First of all, they really have the ordering system wrong. You walk in and have to stand in line while they have one cash register for taking orders. Personally, I love places where I can pay and take my number to a table. There is really nothing more annoying than waiting for a server to bring you your bill so you can leave, although, Chestnut needs to speed up this process. There is no reason why I should have to stand in line for over 15 minutes when only 3 people are ahead of me in line.   I went in today with a broken leg. So clearly after standing at the door on crutches for 15 minutes I was already a little irritated and ready to sit down. The girl who took my order, just rude. You could tell she didn't want to be there and did not want to help me.   We ordered took our number and sat down. I'm still unclear if they bring the drinks to your table or if you're suppose to pick them up. After sitting at our table for another 10 minutes with no one bringing us waters or silverware my boyfriend went up to the coffee counter. There he found my drink and while he was gone an employee brought me his drink. I asked him for waters and he told me I had to get them myself. I explained and showed him I was on crutches and had a broken leg and could not carry them and kindly asked him to bring me one. He scoffed and said alright, the waters never came.   I ordered a Lavender-Honey Latte. Wow....that was the worst coffee drink I've ever had. I asked the girl if I could get something else because it was that terrible. I've never sent back a coffee drink until today. Steer clear of this drink. She brought me a sugar-free vanilla latte with almond milk. It was so-so but not worth $6.   For breakfast I ordered the Bibimbay Bowl which is two poached eggs on a bed of steamed kale, quiona and siracha. I don't know how they managed it, but once again another terrible dish. It was down right disgusting. Salty, the kale wasn't cooked enough and I don't know what seasoning was used but it was awful. After sending back my coffee, which didn't come out until after my food arrived, I wasn't even going to say anything.   After two terrible experiences at this restaurant, I will be eating breakfast at any other restaurant. It's safe to say that Chestnut is possibly the WORST RESTAURANT IN PHOENIX.",

I myself, like to start with a dirty Chai and then head straight into lunch with a hearty Five Spice Banh Mi.  A gorgeous piece of bread topped with chicken, carrots, daikon, cucumbers, pickled onions, jalapenos, cilantro and a sriracha lime mayo.  It comes with a side of sweet potato chips, they are good!  Looking for breakfast?  The banana bread pancakes might peak your interest, they're gluten free so beware of the different texture but they come with vermont maple syrup, honeyed walnuts and some bacon.    If you're in the mood for a different kind of take on breakfast try the Morning Bibimbap bow.  It's filled with quinoa, tamari, green onions and sauteed kale with poached eggs and korean chili paste.  This is going to fill up your belly and put a little fire in your mouth.  Also check out the green eggs and ham, True to its name, the eggs look green because of the fresh pesto they place on top, prosciutto and arugula help round this beauty out.",

I was impressed with my salad - generous portion, good flavors, something I'd never put in the effort to make for myself.   I'd never been to this restaurant before and I found the parking situation a bit confusing. All the spaces for Chestnut up front were taken so I had to park around the back in the parking area shared with the nearby office buildings. I was surprised that you ordered at the counter and seated yourself. Something about the website made me think that there would be table service.   The atmosphere was casual and comfortable - but a bit too noisy for my liking. I also liked that they had dog bowls near the front door, so I suspect dogs are welcome on their patio.",

Here's what we had:  Cocktail: Tiger Mom Appetizer: Bao Steamed Bun with Short Rib  Ramen: with bbq pork, sweet corn, spinach, cabbage    All the food was very tasty and the cocktail, Tiger Mom, was AMAZING! Do yourself a favor and order this delicious frozen mango/coconut concoction!  I would come back just to order this drink.   I'm taking off 1 star because the service was a little spotty...had to get up and ask for my drink and it didn't come until the middle of my entree. BUT we will be back for the food!",

I picked the house ramen in shoyu broth with roast duck, soy egg, nori, and steamed cabbage for my ramen bowl. The ramen was perfectly cooked, and the broth was rich, and so flavorful. Everything else was just icing on the cake.  I ordered mango with sticky rice for my dessert, because C'mom, who could resist this deliciousness?? Not me!! I saw Fluff It Marshmallows Neapolitan pop on the counter at the register, and I couldn't resist buying one. It went really well with my coffee. Trust me when I say this combo was a  match made in heaven. The staff were super helpful and friendly. I love the open concept of this location. I'm glad I made the trip here. Bon Appetit everyone!!!",

One time I asked for oatmeal, and I get granola. Cold eggs, another & burnt coffee one time before that.    This time the I asked for gluten free toast on the side. After I put jam & take a bite I realize it's cold hard bread & not toasted. I tell the waitress I wanted a side of toast. She apologizes & returns 5 minutes later with the same slice I originally had now toasted dark brown ... including the original bitten piece with the jam now cooked into it. Seriously?!? That's pretty cheap that you can't toast a new slice.   Also, the glazing on every slice of bacon is a little over the top. Some don't like sweet bacon but that's not option since you guys don't serve normal bacon. Same goes for the walnuts. Diabetes is a problem & myself included try to watch the sugars we eat. Every now & then we like to indulge but not all the time.   The ambience is great, some of the servers are great, others not so much. I'm not saying don't come here, I'm just saying be prepared to be disappointed.",

However, after I got inside it was kind of hard to navigate and figure out exactly where to order, some signage is much needed.   This place is just starting out, and it's apparent. The employees didn't seem to know the menu very well or how to navigate the POS systems. We ordered breakfast and elixers. It would have been nice if we got our drinks before we sat down, but we had to ask the food runner to locate them. Also, no water when we sat down either, a must here in Arizona.   Now on to the food: It came out quickly and it looked fantastic. We were able to set the other things aside because the food was so damn good.   I had a breakfast bowl with quinoa, poached eggs, kale, and chili sauce. I've been on this crazy organic, vegan, no sugar, wanna kill myself because I just want a donut diet, but this is one of the few places in the valley that has fresh, healthy dishes.   My boyfriend had the banana bread pancakes with bacon. OH MY LORD. I just had a bite, but it was the most magical experience I've had all week.   Once Chestnut works out all the kinks, I think it's going to be one of the hottest breakfast/lunch spots.   Has a hip vibe and fantastic food. I highly recommend.",
