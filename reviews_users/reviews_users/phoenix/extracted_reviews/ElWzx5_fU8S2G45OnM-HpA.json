    "text": "FOOD: Visiting Phoenix for a conference and this place was recommended by a friend! My friend and I were both very pleased with the food we got/shared. Great flavor and good portions (not too little/too much). We got the cauliflower for our appetizer which was presented as two whole pieces of cauliflower. At first I thought it was gonna be a pain having to cut it up ourselves, however it was so tender and great flavor! Loved it! We also got the small plate smoked salmon and the bucatini pasta! The smoked salmon was served cold, with cream cheese, capers, pumpernickel toast and pickled veggies. My friend was not that big a fan of it, but not because it did not taste good, she's just not used to the way they prepared it. I think having cold smoked salmon is a preference and isn't always for everyone. I loved it though, the salmon was so tender and not too smokey, just the right amount. Everything else that came with that dish was just average though. I did not really like the pumpernickel toast, and would have preferred a different type of bread/toast. The bucatini pasta was so good. The pasta noodles were al dente, which I LOVED! Very simple and delicious pasta...AND it wasn't too heavy like most pastas.  There was a little kick of spice to it, however it was not too much.   SERVICE: No complaints here. Our sever was very friendly and helpful. She went over the specials, and even helped us make the final decision on what we ordered (we were slightly indecisive)!   ATMOSPHERE: Super chic and modern! Loved the atmosphere. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, which is nice.   PARKING: we took a Uber here but I think there is a lot? Not too sure.",

The hospitality is beyond what I expected and they're food is absolutely amazing. I will make an effort to stop and eat there EVERY time I pass through Arizona (which is a lot). Thank you to Eli (our waiter) for making our dinner experience unforgettable; and to the rest of the team members, thank you. To the chef and the owner, you really know how to make a dinner experience exceptional.",

    "text": "Ocotillo MEDJOUL DATES, SHEEP'S MILK RICOTTA, MARCONA ALMOND, HONEY WARM BREAD PUDDING BOWL, FALL SPICED CREME, ROASTED APPLES DRIED STRAWBERRY SCONE, VANILLA BUTTER, LOCAL HONEY, PECANS IRON SKILLET PANCAKE, WARM FRUIT COMPOTE, POWDERED SUGAR, MAPLE SYRUP  Named after an indigenous plant of the Sonoran Desert and inhabiting a sprawling space that flows freely from indoors to outside and everywhere in between, it was for brunch on Saturday that I arrived at Ocotillo and with dining companions opting out last minute a four-top shrank to seating for one, a limited tasting to follow as the dining room quickly began to buzz.  Priced like a quick-casual concept with a menu steeped in American classics upgraded by fresh local farms, it was with service that hovered between aloof and overworked that a menu was presented and going entirely sweet in formulating a two-course foursome it was with mild amusement that I watched a woman flip out on the hostess regarding seating arrangements, a not-so-subtle reminder of one of the reasons I moved away from the city some 26 months before.  Brilliantly lit by the midday sun, music playing unobtrusively overhead while photographs of the desert decorated the walls, it was with water refilled infrequently that a short wait separated ordering from round-one, a long plate of dates stuffed with ricotta and almonds lent additional sweetness by honey while an enormous pancake arrived too-hot-to-eat in a cast-iron skillet, the toothsome crumb moist even before adding pure maple syrup or spreading the berries with a portion size large enough to feed four.  Joking with a different server than the one assigned my table that the pancake should come with a warning it was with part packaged for later that a brief break ensued, my waiter apparently also covering outdoor seats with the mimosa crowd now in full bloom, a member of the kitchen staff eventually presenting tableside with two plates and an apology, a nice gesture though certainly not necessary.  Admittedly well-sated, the pancake and dates having followed Doughnuts and Pastry elsewhere, it was with good fortune that both the pair of scones and bowl of pudding were far smaller than the items preceding them, the former far more \"British\" than those typically offered in America as fresh berries and \"vanilla butter\" not dissimilar to clotted cream helped temper the dryness, a problem certainly not encountered in buttery bread pudding sopping up the juice of sauteed and slowly melting aromatic cream.",

Not overbearing and perfect for hilarious conversation. :D   I ate the blue corn pancakes with agave syrup. Dude. I'm not really a corn person. I mean corn is okay, but it's...corn. These were amazing. I can't really speak to what my friend had because it was gone in like three minutes (gains food bruh) and I totally forgot what they had.   All in all it was a pleasant experience, and next time I'm up in the area I may visit again. :)",

The atmosphere was wonderful on the outside portion of the establishment. Visually satisfying with a beautiful grass area that was perfect for the kids to escape and it be acceptable.   We ordered a blue corn skillet pancake, avocado toast, roasted Cauliflower with Aleppo pepper, smoked brisket with polenta and a fried egg. All were beautifully prepared, amazing flavor and exceed my expectations. My Compliments to chef, very talented.  All items were respectfully appropriate to pricing.    MacAllister was our server, very knowledgable of the menu. He suggested basically everything we ordered and included kid friendly options for not having a kids menu, which was so thoughtful. He was very attentive to our needs and had the BEST personality. That made the entire experience a 5 star and beyond.   I will definitely recommend this establishment with high regard, I look forward to the next time and will specifically request the service of MacAllister.   Update: on a date we sat at the chefs table and got to watch the kitchen while we ate some amazing new menu items. Pictures posted.",

The steak was juicy and had a ton of flavor! The grits were so yummy that I could eat large bowls of just the grits!  The skillet pancake was huge and came out on a cast iron with good flavor and syrup that went perfect with it! I didn't use too much syrup though, just a little bit.   If you want a good place to eat, definitely check out Ocotillo! It is not a cheap restaurant, but i am sure you will enjoy it!",

There is also a grassy area and an area with comfy couches to relax and enjoy the gorgeous fall weather.  I had the chicken dumplings off the small plates menu. They had just enough kick to them to make them interesting. My coworker had the tofu sandwich with fries. We both had the desert which was a layered mousse with Samoa Girl Scout cookies...delicious! I will definitely be back to sample more items from their menu.",

She didn't want to give us a table outside because they were all reserved...at 8pm.  We were there at 5pm LOL.  The place.  Trendy/classy set up inside, and casual outside.  Inside was very loud, which could get in the way of a good conversation.  We sat outside at one of the picnic tables in the beer garden.  It was nice that heaters were placed on both sides of the picnic tables.  Most restaurants don't understand that.  The outside is very spacious with lots of standing area.    The food.  We had beets, broccoli, mushrooms, pork steak, chicken wings, and ceviche.  The ceviche was weird.  The sauce that came with the broccoli had a goat cheese type flavor.  For dinner, the chitarra pasta with clams was pretty good.  But the best....pork steak and french fries.  Warning, the pork was a little pink if you're okay with that.  I believe the pickled veggies with peanuts were taken from a famous Vietnamese salad recipe.  The flavor was all too similar.  Works for me because I like the flavor.  Most of the dishes didn't have much flavor.  No one really bragged about their meal, except the 17 year old who loved the ribs and chicken.  What growing 17 year old boy doesn't love a huge plate of ribs or chicken?  After a few bottles of wine and $400 later, we had a great night with friends and watched the Cardinals beat the Packers.",

    "text": "This place is a little off the beaten path but worth a trip! I've been here about 4 times and the food and service have been consistently good. Today I met up with friends for Saturday brunch. I ordered the sheep's milk ricotta dish and the wild mushroom quiche and both were excellent. The ricotta was blended with a little bit of chopped basil and topped with balsamic, sun-dried strawberries, and honey, and served with grilled bread. The quiche was delicious as well and came with a nice side salad.    As far as drinks, if you like fresh ginger, try the Pimm's Cup - my friend ordered one and I stole a taste. I'm not a big gin person but the ginger and citrus perfectly balanced out the cocktail. Two of us also both ordered the Nutella Coffee Boba to drink. I had ordered it on a previous visit and enjoyed it--it had come with a good amount of boba and the (boba-mandatory!) extra-wide straw. Today however they were served to us with small straws, and the boba in both of our drinks were kind of all stuck together. After we pointed these issues out to our waiter he handled it great, though; after he couldn't find any large straws anywhere, he took the two boba drinks off our bill.   If your party is up for sharing food, I think a lot of the items on the brunch menu (including the ricotta dish I got today, or the stuffed dates I had on a previous visit) would be great tapas-style (or even as \"brunch appetizers,\" if that's a thing). One friend I was with today got the avocado & tomato toast which would also be good shared--though maybe I'm just saying that because it looked super tasty & I was definitely eyeing it--I'll have to get it next time!",

I had the breakfast with pita & pita pals which was both great and huge -definitely could have been split I think. My boyfriend had the breakfast chimichanga and he also enjoyed it. Mimosa was good, a little heavy on the OJ for my taste, but par for the course I guess. All in all I was really happy with it and will happily go back if I am in Phoenix again.",

    "text": "Our first impression walking in from the parking lot was, \"Wow, this is a cool place!\" First we walked past a separate coffee shop that had a large and inviting patio. As we approached the uniquely designed restaurant, there were outdoor seating areas with awnings, trees, and other unusual touches.   A smiling hostess seated us promptly in a room with fetching photos of roiling Arizona skies. Our welcoming server, Sunna, took our drink orders as we perused the creative menu. My wife ordered cauliflower over a bed of substantive nutty salad, and I ordered Portuguese soup with mixed large beans, sausage, greens, and herbs in a superb stock.   The dishes arrived straight from the open kitchen. The cauliflower dish was dazzling, mounted in one piece nestled into the salad. The appealing soup came in a large, deep bowl with a handle and accompanied by amazing grilled bread.   Ellen moaned with delight as she delved into the cauliflower and salad. She handed me a bite and I had never known cauliflower could taste so good. She had a spoon of my soup and loved it.   Sunna checked on us early and found happy campers! Ellen and I decided to eat half of our dishes and switch. Together this combo made one of the best lunches we've had in a very long time.   Our experience at Ocotillo was exceptional and Sunna was a big part of it. We plan to go back soon, and we will tell our friends about it. Now I'm telling you about it--go! Ocotillo is a gem.",

We were celebrating our anniversary and our server Mcallister made it so special.  We sat in the main dining room which was a little noisy because every table was filled , but it wasn't unbearable. Mcallister suggested two cocktails to start, one with grilled pineapple infused vodka made in house and another with egg whites and cinnamon. Both were phenomenal.   When it came time to order food he offered to take the reigns and order for us. He started us with a house pulled Mozzarella with carrots three ways, the roasted Cauliflower (our personal favorite) and a bottle of a Grenache blend wine, we both loved the pesto made out of carrot tops!! Second course was a house made pasta with a marinated pulled pork. Last course was the best, a whole fried Mediterranean Sea Bass with a red curry sauce. The presentation was out of this world.   Thanks Ocotillo and Mcallister for making our night unforgettable.",

The buildings here sort of form a neat little courtyard walkway area that you can walk through or host events at while walking towards the main dining room/bar area.  The roasted cauliflower was the best thing of the night hands down - never thought I'd say that at a restaurant but it was damn good.  The Beef Ribs were massive!  Honestly, it was almost too much Meat and too rich, again never thought I'd say that but still worth it to keep my gluttony game fresh. I wish they'd let you substitute out the french fries though on the dishes because that was a little much with the Beef Ribs, it needed some sort of lighter veggie or salad or something.  This place would definitely make a good date night with the unique hip vibe, couple glasses of wine, and a few small plates.",

Service was superb our waiter was very attentive and food was amazing! I invited a couple of friends to brunch, and we wanted bottomless mimosas which they don't advertise but it is actually a thing on Saturdays and Sunday's for 18 dollars which is awesome. What I ordered was something sweet and it was the iron cast skillet pancake which composed of warm fruit compote, powdered sugar and maple syrup! Friends ordered from the light menu and sweet, also savory which they all thought was amazing. I definitely have a love for over easy eggs and hash browns which were amazing! Other than that no complains but if you're a coffee person they also have another part of the restaurant which includes a coffee bar also outdoor yard patio which is amazing with the view and sometimes good weather when we have it in Phoenix. Looking for a new dining in experience stop by! And stay hungry Phoenix!",

Actually like the idea of putting our name in and being texted when the table was ready.  We had time to visit the bar. The bartender was great but not fast. We took our drinks out to the patio and sat under the stars awaiting our text. We noticed a lot of people smiling and a lot of people enjoying the atmosphere. It's nice, casual, fun. When our table was ready, we are pleased to hear it was outside and there was a heater available to us.   The food was delivered and was absolutely amazing. I started with the roasted cauliflower. It was a mixture of flavors that typically one would not place together. However they make it work and work well. I then had the pork sugo  which was superb.   I would recommend this place to the locals and  anyone wanting to come to midtown went evening. It's not too far from the Osborne light rail.",

The ambiance is fairly young they have a DJ playing at the entrance... So you can guess the noise level in this industrial, concrete space. Open kitchen looks very clean with good ventilation never been bothered by smells.  The place gets pretty busy for brunch so I usually seat at the bar - which is nice, direct service from the bar tender! They have a huge outdoor area which is open seating, convenient when the heat is reasonable.  If you can deal with the noise level and the youthful hip aspect of the place it is worth a try.",

We had an appetizer of baby artichokes in an aoli sauce which was quite good.  The asparagus appetizer followed and was bland and not well thought out.  It took over 15 minutes to clear the asparagus plates as well. Dinner entrees followed which were good. Our biggest concern was the staff, numerous servers, waiter hardly there to check on our dining. In closing it was not worth the trip.",

Chicken items mostly good - their Ocotillo chicken is solid and I also like their new Peruvian chicken.  4.5 star food but the sevice is regularly frustrating thus bringing overall rating down to 4 stars.  On last visit we had a hipster dufus who was (like most of their servers) obviously never properly trained and obviously is not making a serious effort.  Server tip #1:  when someone orders an item requiring a steak knife please bring the knife at some point BEFORE the food is served.  Server tip #2:  it is poor form to bring plates to the table and not know who ordered what.  Server tip #3:  never disappear for 10-12 minutes and fail to refill drinks, especially on the patio when temps are 90+.  Server tip #4:  you should help - out and clear plates/refill waters/etc when passing tables which are not 'yours'.  But despite the regular service failures the food is good enough to make up for it.  I've tried all their salads and veggie side dishes.  We always order 1 or 2 extra veggie sides to share with the table.  I think I like the roasted cauliflower best - but the cool cucumber dish is nice on hot days.  And a warning if you order the Japanese - style fish 'n chips - the fries are REALLY fishy tasting (which I like but others have not cared for).  A pretty great though somewhat pricey (about $20/pp incl tax/tip sans alcohol) lunch spot.  Note I think the interior space gets too noisy at lunchtime - and thus much prefer the patio...",

Brisket sandwich with a killer soup (sorry, can't remember what it was now) and supurb service.  Returned today to celebrate our son's 25th birthday. We both had the amazing Ibeza Prosciutto sandwich. I threw the dice and went for the soup, son went with excellent shoestring fries. Soup was potato sausage, was more tomato than potato for me, but it's because they stretch to be different. Great draft beers, excellent time!  We will be back for dinner! Son lives three blocks away and I work three blocks in the other direction.  A nice jewel!",

Of the three times I've dined here, each entree has been in the $30-something range and I've always thought to myself afterwards that they're overpriced by at least $10 a plate.  The atmosphere is fun and always enjoyable in that regard.  But, in a pinch I took colleagues that were visiting town here for dinner and the entire group agreed that dinner was a bit of a bummer.  Let me know what dishes you recommend - maybe I'm just making bad selections?",

The hostess seated us and treated us as if we had all the time in the world. (I've had similar situations where they are pushing you to hurry up.). Corbin came over, letting us know he wasn't our regular server but saw we had been waiting for a few minutes, so he wanted to check on us. He took our orders and off he went. We had the eggplant meatballs which were delicious. I asked if there was a marinara I could get to go with it. There wasn't. But Corbin went to the kitchen and a few minutes later brought me a quick red sauce the chef had made and it was beyond delicious. The level of service here was that of a Michelin-Star restaurant and the food was delicious. I'll definitely be back!",

The interior ambiance was more high class along with highly attentive service. I had the Iberian Ham sandwich which I felt was all around perfect. The fresh bread they used was a perfect balance of light and chewiness, which will not make you feel full. Their balance of ham along with a delicious spread to compliment the cheese and veggies worked perfectly together. Beyond sandwiches their ahi tuna bowl and lunch pasta offerings too were well received by those who I was with. This is a wonderful lunch venue that will not disappoint if you are looking to spend the money.",

    "text": "The first thought that went through my mind after being seated at Ocotillo is:  This place is freaking loud! So loud, in fact, that on a busy Saturday night, it's damn near impossible to have an actual conversation with the person sitting across from you. Although according to the owner, they will be installing panels that will resolve this problem as of August 2017.  The decor is very sleek and modern, similar to a lot of other newer restaurants that are scattered about this area. The menu at Ocotillo strongly emphasizes seasonal ingredients, so things change quite regularly from what I've been told.  My girlfriend and I had some trouble deciding what to get, as the menu is kind of all over the place, mixing a lot of pastas with meat entrees, seafood, and what most people label as \"Modern American.\" Fortunately for them, the food is (mostly) very good if you choose very carefully.  We started with an arugula salad, which had a nice balance of flavors. They could have been a bit more liberal with the cherry shallot vinaigrette, but that's just nitpicking. We both really liked their choice in goat cheese, which was also used quite heavily on their summer squash plate - probably the best thing that we tried.     I struggled at finding a main entree to order, so my girlfriend and I just simply split a pasta of bucatini, which included some pork and ricotta meatballs. Meatballs were excellent quality, while the pasta was a bit hard and incredibly difficult to pick up. The bread used was very chewy and dry, but I'd still say that it was a fairly decently made pasta - but we both agreed that it's not quite at the level of what you might find at places like Mora or Tratto.  They had three options for desserts, including a layered chocolate cake, zucchini cake, and homemade donuts, which I now regret not ordering. We opted for the chocolate cake, which was similar to a black forest-style. I thought it was okay, but nothing memorable that I'd recommend ordering again.  Our server was a nice guy who was very excited to tell us about the restaurant. Although there were some long gaps between portions, he regularly checked up on us to see what we thought about the food - probably aided by the fact that we were taking pictures of everything at all angles.  Aside from a few quips, we both agreed that it was a decent meal. Despite the poor acoustics, I really like the design of the place. Supposedly, they deliver an excellent brunch, which we might end up trying sometime down the road.  Although I wouldn't say that Ocotillo is a place for everyone, I think it fits the area just fine and will most likely continue to do very well in the future.  Recommended!",

But I had made reservations and we were seated right away.  The ambiance is minimalist and I really appreciate that.  I want to be able to sit and have a conversation; the restaurant was a little loud, but obnoxiously so.  We were greeted by two very charming wait staff and we got our drink order in.  The owner/GM came over to chat and shake our hands.  We felt welcomed.   Had difficulty choosing from so many great options.  Our waitress helped recommend some dishes and how they were prepared.  We appreciated her knowledge and that she didnt rush us. The food was outstanding--signature chicken dish and fiance had special pasta of the night.  The chicken was phenomenal and so SO well balanced in flavor.  I ate it like a cannibal  (oops). :)  Fiance loved his pasta.  Very well cooked with fantastic flavor.   Had to get dessert too--fudge cake with blackberry ice cream.  Definitely recommend staying for dessert.   Overall, loved it.  We havent had good luck with food since moving here last summer.  This place was clean, despite it being so busy , friendly and not pretentious and surprisingly affordable.  Our food plus drinks and it was under $80.  We actually checked to make sure our server hadn't left something off.   We, again, got a thank you from the GM/Owner..hand shakes and a \"please come back\".   100% great experience.  Now our new favorite.",

    "text": "Ocotillo is, simply put, amazing. It was a last-minute find for us on our last night in Phoenix, and what an absolute delight.   We started with the chicken meatballs, the ricotta with sun-dried strawberries, and the cauliflower. Each dish was fantastic, and far larger than we expected (we didn't even come close to finishing everything, to the point where we were offering to share with the family at the next table.) Everything was excellent, but the cauliflower was a True standout - tender and flavorful, with just the right amount of crunch. The sun-dried strawberries were also a delightful surprise - sweet and tart and chewy, and a perfect complement to the ricotta.  Speaking of surprises, we were not expecting literally half a cow when we ordered the ribs with garlic-lime fries (be still my heart, they were some of the best shoestring fries I've ever had.) I'm not a huge ribs person, but these were exception - fall-off-the-bone tender, with a perfectly smoky-sweet sauce.  Of course, we were stuffed by this point, but we ordered dessert. The chocolate fudge cake was out of this world. The cake itself is the densest, most chocolatey little brick of goodness you will ever taste, and the homemade blackberry-vanilla ice cream was just the right combination of creamy and tart. The fresh minted blackberries were the perfect finishing touch.  It's been a week and I'm still full, but I can't wait to go back to Phoenix and visit again! Huge shout-out to the servers, who were wonderful, and to whoever mixed our fantastic drinks.",

    "text": "Been here a few times now. The design & different seating areas are great. In the past I remember service & quality being generally pretty good. On the most recent visit my group ended up here after the original place we wanted to try was packed & really warm inside. I knew there would be a wait at Ocotillo (11:30am on a Saturday) but at least I could count on a little more space & that it would be nice & cool, which it was! Took around 35 minutes to get a table for 4. I don't know if they were understaffed but service was very slow. I was really hungry by the time we got seated (doesn't help that I'm 36 weeks pregnant) & the waiter didn't seem to catch our urgency to order. He was EXTREMELY NICE but seemed distracted & would rush off if we hesitated by the slightest. Getting drinks took a long time. I ordered the Two Eggs breakfast which is supposed to come with a coffee. It didn't. Half way through the meal I asked about it & the reply was, \"Oh. I don't normally bring it unless guests ask.\" I think he just forgot honestly, because I've ordered the same breakfast in the past & the coffee came out ahead of time. He did make me a custom iced coffee though for no extra charge so that was cool! The food is good! Their Applewood Bacon is amazing! The Blue Corn Pancake is something legends are made of! I know I will end up back here at some point simply because of the dishes but I hope service gets better. Also, why can't you order things from the coffee bar when you're at the restaurant!? You used to be able to, don't know when it changed. Since I was so hungry in the beginning, I asked about getting some kind of pastry or something & was told I would have to go to the coffee bar & get it myself. I did & I was allowed to bring it back to our table but it seems silly! Kind of like having a bar at your restaurant but guests have to go get the drinks themselves. Like huh??",

My dressing was just oil.  When I pointed it out to the waiter, he just said, \"yea, I think it might be broken.  Plaid my bill, and as I was leaving I was watching the kitchen.  One if the cooks took a metal spoon, dipped it into a pot, held it for another cook to taste, then tasted it himself, wiped it off with a rag and stirred the pot with it.  That's right, two of the used the spoon to taste it and kept using it.  Clearly this was acceptable.  Told the manager and he was shocked, but I pointed out all 5 people in the kitchen had seen this happen and no one said anything.  I bet it happens all the time.  No thanks, too many choices in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch during the week and had a decent size crowd for 11:30am. There seem to be 2 hostess stands which doesn't make sense upon entering and the no one is willing to help you out unless specifically asked. The service was bad from the start. The hostess acting confused about why you're there (showing up to a restaurant and wanting to sit down to eat apparently is a be concept) and the server came by after 10 mins of sitting, then when we wanted to order he said he wanted to get waters first and will be back. Seriously another 10 minutes passed before he came by again.  Well if you've looked at the menu you will likely have a couple questions or want to hear a recommendation but I didn't have 30 minuets of just sitting without placing a food order. So took a shot and went safe with sandwiches. We ordered the brisket sandwich (absolutely delicious - a little skimpy on the brisket but I liked it a lot) and ordered the chicken tonto sandwich - which was just added to the menu a couple weeks ago. The chicken sandwich was not good and all I could taste was smashed up black beans. Absolutely no hint to taste the guac or chicken. I opened up the sandwich and just ate the chicken directly and tossed the rest. Don't expect much chicken either - prob totaled the amount of 1 chicken nugget.  I would be open to trying this place for brunch if I had no other plans the rest of the day - but no way I'd go back for lunch. You would have to clear your calendar since the service is so awful. If it wasn't for liking the brisket sandwich, I would be completely out on this place. PS - it's extremely loud in here so not a good place for business meetings.",

When I think of a good service, I want someone who cares that I am taken care of, but doesn't do too much,  or too little to take away from the experience. I want my wife and I to enjoy a night with each other and speak about life rather than anything other than how wonderful the food is regarding the restaurant. Ocotillo nails it. On New Years Eve the Menu does not change. They didn't make some ridiculous menu for that night. I want \"Ocotillo\"whatever day we choose,  and they deliver.  I've had there Ribs. They were the best. Get them. Their seasoned and cooked to perfection. I don't drink. But my wife always grabs one and the drinks are spectacular as well. Solid dinner option in the competitive Phoenix Restaruant Market. Number #1 in my Phoenix Restaruant power rankings. Boom",

    "text": "Ok we tried this place AGAIN and their service is still so frustrating. I would use stronger language but it would get flagged. You'd think with this location they would offer some options for food that are unique and interesting, but even the chimichanga (when it's not sold out) is plain and lacking any seasoning. I'm usually more forgiving of a restaurant because they are trying so hard to make things perfect you can tell they're working out the kinks. But here you can tell that this is as good as it's going to get.   The service is hit and miss. The table next to you will get there 20 minutes after you and leave before you having finished everything. This has happened THREE times now. It's a joke and is so unacceptable.   And every time you go there, they're out of something. First sangria, then chimichanga, then sangria! So you think those things are off the chain, right? Well you'd be wrong. This is a mediocre crew running a beautiful space. I hope they figure this out before Phoenix wakes up and smells the coffee (brewing down the street). Good riddance Ocotillo. You've driven away another group of customers. The only redeeming quality is the location and the manager who was putting out fires left and right the whole time we were there.   UPDATE- Walter S who identifies himself as the owner/chef just called me a dick in a compliment and can't wait to see me again. I have the note saved on my phone. Honestly, why would anyone support this place?",

The house pulled mozzarella with carrots three ways was a delicious new take on the typical preparation. The pecan wood smoked beets were earthy and perfectly cooked. The truffle honey added a welcomed sweetness to the plate.

It comes swimming in yummy salt meat flavored juices. There is an egg on top. And in the middle of it all is PARMESAN GRITS! Parmesan. Grits. I couldn't finish it. I got to eat it twice. I'm so happy : ' )  The wine list is also really fun to look at, even if it's a bit overwhelming. There are little icons that denote different flavors. The only rough thing is that the most tannic wines seem to only be sold by the bottle (wails).  My friend got the massive pancake, and it was massive. Like, so massive. So were the salads, which I eyeballed from across the room because I'm a creep. Basically, I get the sense these folks don't mess things up.

We sat outside on the front patio and the temperature was perfect, and so was the atmosphere. Not too loud, not TOO fancy. Our server Jana was super sweet and personable. We shared several items. The smoked beets were our favorite. They were so rich and earthy and I could have eaten them all day. The sweet potatoes were delicious as well with a very unique and flavorful sauce. We also had the Ocotillo chicken which was large (a half chicken), tender, and well seasoned. We had a bottle of champagne (yay birthdays) and shared a dessert (the pound cake with lemon curd and blueberries). We both left full (but not exploding), and sooooo happy. Definitely above my expectations and one of the better meals I have had in a while. Love the seasonal menu, veggie options, and the kind staff. Plus the restaurant is like a cool steel and stone compound with great style. They were having two events during our dinner and we didn't feel crowded, rushed, or anything. If I even find myself in Phoenix again I will be back!",

It was a bit loud, but appropriate because there was a retirement party going on. The cocktail list is pretty baller, creative and interesting. The menu is broad, from salad to small plates to mains. Definitely get the cauliflower appetizer with kale pesto -- it's a luscious, roasted whole head of cauliflower surrounded by a deliciously rich, garlicy pesto grounded with the earthiness of the kale. The chicken meatballs are another great choice, large, fried, and tender with a creamy coconut curry sauce. The gazpacho is less successful -- while the peaches are a nice touch, it could use some acid. Overall, a great place on Central.",

The food presented well but lacked in flavor.    I was curious as to why there are salt and pepper shakers on the table.   I can see why.  My dish was rather bland in taste, and I was thinking, if I added a tiny bit of salt, I'm sure that would have helped.   Perhaps they are being mindful of not too much sodium, which I agree completely with, but there are other ways of flavoring food with herbs and spices without adding to the sodium content.  After all, I'm not a big sodium person myself.  I don't know what they meant by \"white shrimp.\"    Looked like any other shrimp to me.   Yes, they were large and tasty.   I did take about half of it home, and I added my own seasoning to it, which, after having done so, it did taste a lot better.    It is pasta in an herb sauce with some sort of oil.   I guess he liked his cassoulet.    He mentioned he would probably order it in the winter versus the summer.    I didn't know what he meant by that.   Perhaps he associates the beans and other veggies in the dish with something one eats on a cold, blustery day.   I tried a bite, but got some of the goat cheese, and you know what I think about goat cheese.   UGHHH!    It's not a dish I would order since I am not a lentil person.   It is a cute place.   Once the place started filling up, though, it was hard to hold a conversation with one's \"indoor\" voice.   The acoustics are bad.   Would I go back?   Probably not.",

I would go back to accommodate another persons desire to go, but I wouldn't go back out of choice. The food scene in Phoenix is rapidly growing, but lately I haven't been impressed.   The theme that seems to be as of late is, if the building and atmosphere is really unique and beautiful then it will make the food taste better.  Well it doesn't.   There are plenty of other restaurants that have figured out how to serve excellent food and provide a unique and beautiful building and atmosphere.  This is not one of them. The food here is just alright.   The chickens wings are served as the entire drum and wing.  Why?  It makes no sense to make \"eating\" more complicated.  It doesn't make it taste better, it just makes the person trying to eat the food frustrated. The pasta is \"meh\".  The table ordered three different pasta dishes and not one single person was impressed.   The cilantro-lime fries....don't get too excited.  These are not super crispy fries tossed in a cilantro, oil, salt, parmesan, lime bath like you were hoping for.  They are average fries served with a slice of lime for your squeezing pleasure and rather large chunks of cilantro on top.   The crispy fish for two....I was so excited about this dish.  Presentation was nice, but sharing this dish was complicated and there wasn't much substance to the meal.  I felt like I was just picking, which I could have gotten past had there been \"mind blowing flavor\" worth working so hard for. As we were leaving, I looked around and noticed a sea of empty tables and chairs.  There were so many tables and chairs that I felt overwhelmed.  It would be an incredible accomplishment for any restaurant to be able to fill this many seats.  Not sure this concept will pull it off.",

    "text": "I was so excited to really like this place. The vibe is great and the menu looks so promising, but falls super short. As a matter of fact, I was three people and everyone felt that it was really lackluster.    First, we ordered two appetizers for the table.  One, the salmon ceviche which after the first helping, no one ate more and the wings. The wings were really hot. They were so dry and with almost no meat at all. They give four wings. We each had one and no one touched the other one.   The entrees were okay.  I was going to order the ribs, but didn't want to spend $30 bucks only to be super disappointed.  So, I ordered the cheeseburger and it was good.   My two friends had luke warm responses and feeling about their own meals.   We skipped desserts, again because we didn't think the cost would be worth the experience.   Service was okay. Left over appetizer plates sat in the table for far too long. Maybe because they thought we were going to finish them.   I would not go back.",

There were air conditioners and it was pleasant, not cool but totally comfortable. The patios are huge with tables, couches and grassy areas. Really a beautiful, contemporary space.  The GM and the waitstaff were so friendly and great offering suggestions and chatting. We ordered the crispy chicken meatballs and the clams for apps. The meatballs were ok- the sauce and chilies they sat on were great! Maybe more of the sauce? If you didn't get a bit of sauce, chili and cilantro with the meatball it was a bit bland. The clams were good but had bacon and beans. I'm more of a lemony garlic sauce clam person.  We ordered the beef ribs with cilantro lime fries and the roaster cauliflower to share. Jeez! Good thing we did. There were 5 ginormous ribs and they were SOOOOOOOOO delish. I am not a huge beef rib fan and I could have finished them off but would have seriously paid for it. The fries wet crispy and tangy with the cilantro lime. I  cauliflower but this was just ok. Again, the sauce it was sitting on was really good. it was almost a head of cauliflower, sliced in two. I think we would have preferred smaller pieces with the sauce mixed in.  For the four items and three drinks (they have a delightful rose on he menu) it was $100.  A bit on the pricy side but the portions were HUGE! We brought one whole meal home of ribs, fries and cauliflower.  Will definitely return!",

It looks like a renovated storage unit and it offers a variety of seating arrangements- tables and couches outside, long high tables inside as well as booths on one end and white tablecloth seating on the opposite end. The vibe of Ocotillo seems hip casual but also somewhat upscale. I ate here for dinner one night and my food was very tasty. We ordered a cauliflower for the table that was cooked perfectly and has a delicious mint and peanut flavor. The meat eaters at the table were pretty impressed and wouldn't stop raving about it. After placing my entree order for a falafel burger I immediately felt like I made a mistake and should have ordered something more interesting because there menu has delicious sounding small plates, pasta and salads to choose from but WOW. For not being a Mediterranean restaurant, they do falafel RIGHT. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and not dry. The beets that accompanied it made it outstanding. Everyone else at my table was pleased with their food- pastas and ribs.  My only complaint is that you don't have the option to order a lighter side with a sandwich or burger- it just comes with fries.  The service was okay, not fantastic but they were relatively new at the time so I'm sure it's improved. I had a fun experience so I'm definitely going back!",

A space near the bar, a grassy area, a traditional patio....all with a very modern farmhouse feel. Our group included lots of babies and little kids, and the space was perfect for keeping them entertained. The service was very friendly and a very slight delay was totally excusable since they had only been open 2 weeks, and we came in a group of 12. The beer and cocktail list is pretty cool. They have a wide selection for decent prices, and include a bottomless mimosa option ($15? $20? I can't remember....). We also shared a big bottle of beer...a saison that was pretty good, wish I could remember the name. The brunch food overall was good, not great. Pancakes and breakfast chimi were just ok. The bread pudding and burger were pretty good. Where Ocotillo really shined was their veggies. Loved both the zucchini and the cauliflower. Can't wait to sit outside when the weather gets a little cooler at happy hour.  Note to Ocotillo management: are you planning to add some misters/fans in the outside space??? It could use it! Also, there seemed to be a lot of flies out the morning we were there. I don't know if there's anything you can do about that....",

    "text": "I was invited to Ocotillo yesterday for the first time. I was with 4 other people when we walked into the restaurant. Immediately greeted by two young girls at the hostess stand. We exchanged Hello's and one of the girls asked if we had reservations (very short and Curt.) We replied no because if you call Ocotillo they tell you no reservations under 8 people.  Also by  the looks of the place we we're early and there were plenty of empty tables. She continues to be very rude and tells us we need to order from some counter then sit at a table in the back. We walk away very confused and turned off by the way these girls are treating us. As we approached a table out back the other girl from hostess stand comes up behind us and rudely states not these tables! So we look at her baffled and she doesn't proceed to explain any procedures or where exactly we are supposed to go. At this point one of our friends says let's just go. There were plenty of staff standing around that could have stepped in and helped us out. As we are leaving I walked back up to hostess stand and just let them know we felt like we have been treated very poorly. The two girls NEVER apologized one of the girls asked \"your upset cause we don't have a table\"(rude again.) I replied \"No it is your poor customer service, tone and attitude. Attention manger if you want great representation for your restaurant consider who you put at the podium!",

The food is cutting edge while homely, offering great bites for lunch and dinner.

Event manager Steve was condescending from the time I made the reservation, six weeks ahead.  In every interaction he made it clear that I was lucky he was letting me and my friends dine at \"his\" restaurant.    Ocotillo has lovely ramada seating for 30 - perfect for our party - but Steve wanted an additional $200 charge for the \"privilege\" of picking where we wanted to be seated.  he also asked for an additional $200 for separate checks.  I know that's a lot of separate checks, and they are a hassle, but $200???  It's not like this place has a Michelin star.  Our server, MacAllistair, did his best, however assigning a single server to a party of 30 was another signal of how little our patronage was valued.  I never, ever expect to have my butt kissed at any establishment, but I expect that when I am bringing 30 people to your restaurant, you will at least make me feel appreciated, and not like I am a bother, which is the way Ocotillo treated me.",

Walking in is pretty exciting and impressive. The long walkway to the front door is flanked with outdoor seating and bars on both sides. Great energy from the start.   The menu: 2 thumbs up from this girl! At first glance I knew I was coming back again to try different items. I was super excited to see they offer a cocktail called Pimms Cup. I haven't had one in years and was eager to try one again. BUT TO MY DISAPPOINTMENT they were out of the pimms. Sigh . Dang it! So I had the bloody Mary and the brisket/polenta dish. Good portion and tasty tender brisket.   Fast forward to today! ( a week later) Couldn't wait to get in there and order that Pimms Cup and try a new menu item. TO MY DISAPPOINTMENT AGAIN!! \"We're sorry, we don't have any Pimms right now, the purchaser forgot to order it.\" Sigh    So I had the Ocotillo breakfast. I will say that the avocado toast was really tasty with a unique Smokey flavor. Whatever spices were used are spot on.   Overall great food. Just disappointed no one is paying attention to the Pimms.",

When I initially contacted the restaurant I spoke to Walter S. who, when responded to my inquiry, didn't even answer the question. I asked, are you accepting reservations on Easter Sunday? And he replied \"we are only early, we have a private event at 2pm\". So... yay, nay? When I asked a second time I mentioned we were also staying for Blondish and he said, yes and requested a time. I wanted it for 1pm which wasn't a problem at first but the next day he told me because of the show we had to move the reservation up so we weren't rushed out of the restaurant. When I responded I told him I wasn't sure why that would happen when we were staying for the show but okay we can move it to noon. He said he didn't realize we were staying (when I already told him we were) and then told me we could have it at 1pm. I didn't both moving it back to 1pm because I had told guests the time of my brunch changed.   So, the day before the big day I get a call to confirm my reservation and they proceed to tell me we have to leave between 2pm-3pm so they can set up for the show. What?? I wasn't told that before. Well good thing I didn't change my reservation back to 1pm otherwise we wouldn't have had enough time to eat! And it's not like we could just walk down the street to a bar to pass time either. So annoying. We ended up driving to another place for that hour and came back to enjoy Blondish.   Let me also talk about the food. I had 15 people at brunch and service was SLLOOOWWW AF! Not only did it take over 20 min to get drinks, everyone but 2 of us got their food. 40 min after the food was brought out was when they decided to tell us that they ran out of food in general when our order was put in. The 2 orders that were missing was french toast. Seriously?? You ran out of bread and it took you that long to let us know. It appears that they brought out cinnamon rolls out instead for free for them but that's hardly acceptable considering the time it took to do all that. That server definitely did not deserve the \"automatic gratuity\" that they tacked on to our bill. Plus, the food that did come out wasn't even hot. The brisket tasted old although the polenta was good.   We loved the show and the venue, don't get me wrong. But the cherry on top of the cake was when my boyfriend stubbed and cut the hell out of his big toe when he ran into what looked like a railroad tie sticking out in the middle of the grass by the stage!   Maybe I'd give this place another chance if they host another concert and for the drinks since they're decently priced but they truly missed the mark on giving a good first impression.",

I've only eaten here for brunch, but every time reservations have been made and carried out smoothly.

Local and thoughtfully crafted drinks.   We sat outside, enjoyed the spacious patio complete with a fire and live music. The cocktails are on point, the Bloody Mary has great flavor and the falafel we shared certainly has complex, original flavors.    We will be going back some evening to enjoy the fine dining inside for an elegant date.",

Our Sunday Brunch was amazing! From the wonderful atmosphere to the phenomenal food I went home drooling and planning my return trip!   We started with the Pineapple Coconut Upside Down Pancake. That alone, with the bottle of mimosa, was ecstasy on a patio! But no, we rolled the dice and ordered some more.. My fried chicken breakfast was so crisp, yet deliciously tender inside that I am a renewed fan of friend chicken!   Any place that brings you a bottle of champagne and various side juices to complement your mimosa  knows how to set the stage for a fantastic brunch. Back to the menu, my wife had the salmon and let's  just say she usually shares but not this time.. guess it was delicious!   Writing this review is making me hungry so I'll have to finish with a few photos. Otherwise I may start chewing on my phone,.. Update to follow..",

    "text": "Came here for a spontaneous brunch date with my SO. We were originally going to goto another nearby breakfast joint, but the wait was WAY TOO LONG. We just happened to drive past Ocotillo and it immediately caught our eyes.  First off- parking. There's a private lot and street parking. You shouldn't have any trouble in that regard.  This place is CUTE! They've got a patio decorated with lots of fairy lights and they've also got corn hole, tons of seating, and misters. We obviously didn't sit outside this time around, but I would definitely love to check it out again sometime in the fall or evening. The ambiance is pretty trendy and casual, but I was certainly underdressed (I just came from the airport!!) so if you're gonna go here, put on a nice T-shirt and shorts and NOT workout clothes (oops).  The staff is super friendly -- they opened the door for us right when we arrived, immediately served us water, and took the time to answer any questions we had about the menu! Also, we were seated immediately and didn't have to wait a single minute (I think we got lucky because about 15 minutes later, this place got super busy!)  My SO got the ribs, I got the house smoked salmon, and we split a cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll was quite tasty, but it was reallllllly sweet. I recommend sharing it because if this. I didn't try my SO's wings, but the presentation was lovely! As for my salmon, A+ for taste AND presentation!  I only gave this place 4 stars because there was one small mixup between the kitchen and our waitress. Our waitress was super sweet and apologetic (she apologized so many times!), but my SO ended up waiting 30-45 minutes for his dish to come out.. Meanwhile, I'm eating away at my salmon. By the time my SO got his dish, I was done eating.  I'll be sure to update my review the next time I peek in.",

Met a few friends on a Saturday for brunch and there was no crowd at all.  Maybe because we got there at 10.  Had this amazing pancake like treat topped with pork belly and roasted peaches.  It was perfection!  Followed up with a Ahi Salad that was equally noteworthy. I had to take 1/2 of it home because the servings are very generous here. My friends had the burrito and egg in a skillet and I didn't hear any complaining!  Cocktails are a plenty.  I would say their a bit pricey but a pitcher of mimosa might be a good deal for a crowd.",

    "text": "We came here based on the 4 star rating and the professional photos posted by the restaurant. I thought this could finally be a Phoenix brunch place that could compare with my experiences in bigger cities. Unfortunately, there were several disappointing clues that signaled this place is not a decent brunch place from the beginning:  1. Upon sitting down, we were served water in glasses that had a strong egg smell. My husband is not usually sensitive to smelly glasses and even for him it was extremely off-putting.   2. No artisan (decent) coffee in this place. They only have drip coffee and even that left alot to be desired.  Plus, full-size spoon was brought with the coffee!  3. The food. My husband ordered cheese steak that came with fries. The fries were very mediocre and looked like the pre-made frozen kind. The cheese steak was bland, dry, and not edible. The much photographed skillet pancake made a nice entrance when brought to the table. However, firstly the skillet was so hot that it was difficult to eat the pancakes for a good 15 minutes. They didn't bring a serving table on the side of the skillet. The pancake tasted alright, not very special.   This disappointing experience was not unique to us. The table next to us ordered champagne and it came in an ice bucket that was not clean. The guests asked their server to change it. Overall, we will never be back here and I am confused with the popular reviews. Lastly, it is important to note that despite all this,  our server was observant that we did not like the cheese steak. Therefore, she asked about it, apologized, and did not charge us for the cheese steak.",

However, I did find a few things to be pretty pleasing about this place. I ordered the happy hour pasta dish, it was basically a baked pasta with pork and a crispy layer of baked cheese on top. I did enjoy this pasta dish, it wasn't your typical red sauce though they definitely added their own spices and special touch to it. We also ordered the roasted carrots and the pork rillette. The carrots were okay, I was expecting them to have a little more flavor and the sauces that were served with them were just okay. The pork rillette was okay as well. Probably would not order those two dishes again, however they did have a few pasta dishes that I would be interested in coming back to try. Happy hour pricing is pretty good on certain drinks and food items. It's a really big restaurant too so I'm sure they do larger events here.",

I took my parents here and we all found something to enjoy which is a small miracle! Now, do not expect huge \"American style\" portions cause it is not the Cheesecake Factory. Their dishes are meant for sharing and tasting lots of flavors, which personally, I love. The open layout and patio cannot be beat. Misters, shade, sitting niches, and pretty landscaping are thoughtful touches. The design and artwork are tasteful and continue the AZ theme. The service was on point. When we addressed that one of the entrees was not what we had anticipated the server took it off the bill without quibbling. Apparently there are several different rib options which caused some confusion.   My only complaint is there were flies buzzing around us while eating beautiful food in the beautiful space. Ugh! I understand there are huge doors, however we were seated inside to escape the elements. Batting flies was distracting and detracted from our enjoyment. Improve the flying insect situation and it's five stars, easy.",

    "text": "Imagine ordering a $50 steak and having them serve kraft mac and cheese as a side. That's how I feel when I order a $14 pancake and get Aunt Jemima syrup served with it. I don't know why it's so hard for these nicer restaurants to serve REAL maple syrup with your breakfast?   Anyways. Our first time checking this place out. We were greeting with \"you can sit inside but you have to finish your food within an hour because all of our indoor tables have reservations in an hour.\"   First, hi welcome. Second, what kind of restaurant lets ALL of their tables be reserved for brunch (it wasn't a party/event). I understand they want to make money and brunch is popular, but really, ALL of your tables reserved? Come on.   The food was okay. We had the two egg combo breakfast, the hashbrown cake was different but very good, generous portion of everything. Also got the pineapple upside down pancake and a side of syrup (hence above statement). The pancake was different, it was fluffy but somewhat dry. It seemed to be more dough-like than pancake batter.   Server service was ok. A little slow at first as it looked like he had two parties of 6+ and a few other tables as well as ours. From what it looked like none of the tables ordered when we were sat so it took some time to get things rolling. Debating if we will try it again, but we will make a reservation next time so we don't have to rush.",

    "text": "Amazing meal with even more amazing service! First off, the ambiance at Ocotillo is perfect for a romantic date or a sexy gathering with a group of friends. There's indoor and outdoor seating, and from what I saw, the property is fairly extensive. Our group came in for dinner, and I was surprised to learn they do everything from morning coffee bar to brunch to wine to dinner. Rarely do I ever think a venue can do it all, but based off of what I experienced during our dinner, I actually might believe that it's possible at Ocotillo.  We started our dinner with an array of appetizers and each one was more amazing than the last. How you can make roasted cauliflower mind blowing is beyond me, but they managed to pull it off! The carrot fatoush salad made my heart and arteries sing, while a cheese bruschetta dish made my mouth go into shock from sublime happiness. What was more astounding was that most of my side of the table was abstaining from gluten and meat (side note: Which meant more for me! Yay!) but this didn't phase our waiter one bit. He happily swapped out ingredients and helped everyone navigate the menu towards dishes which would work for each of their diets. Oh and he always kept the water and wine glasses full which ensured an even more joyous celebration of friends.   The only one ding in our meal was the pasta, which came highly recommended by our waiter, but I found was too thick and glutenous to chew through. I'd go with the gigantic Fred Flinstone slab of ribs next time if you're into feeling like you're at a jousting competition with King Arthur and Lancelot. You'll see what I mean when you order it! It'll make you feel like it's Christmas and you just got your Red Rider bb gun.",

    "text": "No hype, but definitely a sweet spot to grab dinner. We don't exactly have spots like this in too many places across the US, where you can eat in a sort of patio-breezway in the middle of winter. That alone is worthy of praise. I sat underneath the heater and it was plenty warm, that's for sure. Didn't really need the heater. We sat on a long table with a big group and had dinner in the almost out of doors.  We started with a bunch of apps and I'mma stop you at the cauliflower because that's all you really need to know. All the industry magazines and trendwatchers say that 2017 is the year of the cauliflower, and I'd believe it. They roast it and season it to perfection and it didn't last long on the table. The salad with hummus was nice, the bruschetta was great, but it all began and ended with the cauliflower. Get it.  In another episode of \"What I should have ordered,\" the recently-returned to the USA fella in front of me got the ribs. Not only were they massive but they were indeed delicious. I snuck a sample. Deal with it. I ordered a pasta dish and while the flavors were there, it didn't all come together texture-wise. Not sad about it, just wish I hadn't eaten ribs the night before and had the drive to eat another rack.   I don't drink, but apparently the owner is a former/current sommelier, so wine is a big deal here. They seem to have a wide offering and if you pair that with the ambiance you've got a night of furtive glances and hopeful coupling going on before you.",

There is community seating in the back and on the side of the restaurant there is a patio with more traditional seating. The patio is right on a road.  I ordered a mescal cocktail which was delicious.  You can go really right here, but maybe stop by Yelp before ordering.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love Ocotillo based on the pictures I saw posted & the reviews I read through. Unfortunately, for us that was not the case. We went in for my boyfriends birthday dinner and had even higher expectations for this reason. When we arrived, we were greeted and offered a seat in either the dining room, the bar area, or the heated patio. We opted for the dining room and were taken to our seats immediately. My first observation was that the seating was so close together on both sides of the table that even a normal sized person would have issues squeezing through to get to the booth seat! Also, while no body around us was talking loudly, their entire conversation could be heard simply based on the fact that they were so close to us. The restaurant itself was very loud which made it hard to have a conversation either way.  Our waiter came by soon after we were seated and took our drink and appetizer order. We got the fried zucchini first. When another waiter dropped it off at our table, he walked away so fast I couldn't even ask him for a couple of small plates so we could share, and we were also missing one set of silverware. It took a few minutes to track someone down to get what we needed. The dish itself, while it was decent, was definitely nothing to write home about. The biggest problem with it was that it was lacking salt! The burrata with the zucchini was an interesting combination and paired well with the spicy peppers & balsamic. I most likely would ask for it without mint ... and again, not to harp on this but I believe this would have been really tasty with a sprinkle of salt!  The orginal waiter came by as we were eating the appetizer to ask if we had decided on our main meals yet. It felt a bit rushed as he hadn't bothered coming by to check on us regarding the appetizer, but we ordered the Ocotillo Chicken & the Peking Duck. Even though it was busy, it didn't take too long for them to bring the food out. The plates looked absolutely beautiful when they were dropped off to us! The taste however ... I'd say it was interesting.  Firstly, the best thing at the table was the polenta that was underneath the duck. It was really creamy and tasty, I don't know how it was made but if I could just order a bowl of that, I would! I don't care for duck but did have a couple of bites and noticed it was well cooked & had a very crispy skin. It wasn't particularly flavorful though, so if you order this, make sure you like duck! My boyfriend said he's pretty much done with duck as it tastes really gamey.  Next, the chicken dish - my biggest complaint is that it was really hard to cut. For some reason, I was expecting that they'd just have chicken breasts a top the potato salad but this wasn't the case. The dish that the food was served in was so small it took a lot of effort to separate what I wanted to eat with the bones that I didn't. Another waiter noticed my struggle and brought a larger knife. Unfortunately, by that point, I was just done trying. The potato salad was yummy and tasted good with the au jus that was on the bottom. The chicken itself also had a really crispy skin like the duck, but didn't have much flavor.  Yet again, our waiter came by just to drop off the check. If the other components of the restaurant really wow'ed us, we would have consider coming back for a meal a different day. The service was really lacking and the prices of the dishes were really high (not worth it) so unfortunately, it was probably our first and last time at Ocotillo.",

    "text": "I'll be honest in stating that I knew nothing about Ocotillo before dining there. (I didn't do my research - AKA Yelp \"homework.\") But I'm glad it worked out that way, because from cocktails to dessert, I was surprised, impressed and delighted over and over.  Our group dinner had a heavy assortment of apps, salads, entrees and desserts, but for me the Cauliflower appetizer was everything! This steak-ey cut of cauliflower tastes as thought it was bathed in lemon juice (and zest) - which is a good thing, because I am crazy bunny boiler fan of lemon. With other flavors of mint, basil, kale, and peanuts, it's beyond perfection and I would easily order this as my main entree next time. The Carrot Fatoush Salad (particularly with the creamiest feta I've ever tasted) was a close second, followed by the bruschetta-like toast topped with fried sunchokes and crispy brussels sprouts. I can't seem to find this item on any of their menus, so perhaps it was a night's special - or made especially for us.   Pastas are made in-house, ribs were a hit at the table, and brunch is rumored to be a must. Oh, and service is outstanding.   As for the massive layout - the each nook and area has its own vibe, offering something completely different in the various seating areas. And there are plenty! Inside dining, bar seating, patio seating, lounge seating, fire pits, a grassy knoll, outside bar ... event an adjacent coffee and pastry bar across the patio.   I'm not sure when I'll return to Phoenix, but if I do I'll head straight over to Ocotillo.",

He suggested a wonderful bottle of Pinot, in the $100 range but so worth it!  I had asked for something similar to one of my favorite pinots, Belle Glos and he directed us to this magnificent bottle from Russian River.   Now to the food! For starters, we did a Brussels sprouts and fig plate which was very refreshing and tasty. Well balanced. But the winner was the fresh ricotta with sun-dried strawberries with mint and balsamic. It was amazing and so different! It came with fresh bread as well so you could make your own bruschetta, delish!!!!   For our Entrees: we had the smoked parpadelle with chicken ragu in a spicy sausage,  fresh linguine with fresh herbs and preserved lemon. As well as the Chicken thigh. It was all so perfectly prepared & executed. I am Honestly Inot surprised this was voted best new restaurant last year! Well done team!

The restaurant itself is huge so even when it's busy it doesn't seem crowded or loud. We have always sat at the bar and had a great experience with super friendly bartenders. The menu is a little weird- they don't have names for any of their dishes, instead it's a list of all the ingredients so you know exactly what is included. I love the sun dried strawberries in balsamico with herbed ricotta, basil, and country bread. It is the perfect semi-light start to the day. I've also had the smoked salmon with capers and dill creme which I thought was good. It is served with a tea egg, pickled shallots, and grilled seeded bread so you can build your own toast creation. I couldn't write a review without mentioning their fantastic Bloody Mary {Sobieski vodka | house spicy tomato juice} garnished with an olive, lemon, lime, pickled jalapeno and white cheddar. I don't know what they put in their tomato juice (I assume crack) but it is amazingly spicy, fresh, and delicious- seriously one of the best bloodies I've ever had!",

    "text": "If I could give two different reviews, one for the food and the other for the service, I would.    I've now been to Ocotillo twice.  First time I went there was with coworkers for lunch during the week.  There were five of us and one toddler.  We sat indoors.  The service was great. Our waiter came back several times to make sure that we were okay, before our other friend arrived.  The food arrived on time and we all enjoyed our meals.  I got the fish and fries.  I don't recall the name of it on the menu, but it was cooked perfectly and was very flavorful.  My friends all enjoyed theirs as well.  Atmosphere was great and by the time we left lunch, the place was packed.  Lots of conversation and everyone seemed happy.  Second time I went to Ocotillo was yesterday and that's where the 3 stars come in.  We had a seat outside.  The weather was spectacular.  We were sat by the hostess and had glasses for water sitting empty for 10 minutes+ from when we first sat down.  Finally someone stopped by to give us some water.  Then another 5 or so minutes before someone came over to us to take our drink orders.  By this time, I was starving so I ordered an appetizer.  We ordered the ceviche which was delicious.  I mean very unique take on any ceviche I've ever had.  Scallops and grapefruit in a shell.  Really nice presentation too.  We finally ordered our food.  I ordered a ribeye and fried eggs with hash browns, my boyfriend ordered the brisket.  Both were very tasty.  The ribeye, however was very fatty.  I know that ribeye is a fattier cut of meat, but I'm not a huge fan of that kind of marbleing throughout the meat.  The whole meal really was tasty though.  And then when we finished our meal, we waited for a server for at least 20 minutes before we saw anyone again.  We did want another drink and waited for a long while for that.  When we finished that... it was easily close to another 20 minutes before we saw someone to give us our check... and then another long while to get someone to take our money.  My boyfriend went up to pay instead.    Great food at this place, but the service outdoors was kind of crummy.  They staff was really nice, but just very very very slow... and at times not very attentive.  We'll be back, but may not sit outdoors next time.  Btw, I actually made reservations both times.",

There are so many selections for dinner like ribs, chicken, fish, and house made pastas. I got the ribs and the cilantro lime fries. I was very impressed. The espresso mole sauce was excellent and the beef was so tender. It came right off the bone. I had questions about the wine menu, and the GM David gave me great recommendations for a red wine. Overall it hit all five stars.",

The hostess was kind enough to suggest that my bf and I should sit at the bar instead of waiting a while for a table. I am so glad I did. My bartender Bud was funny, quick, and gave good service. He was making us all these amazing cocktails including my favorite...the Barrymore? Also I got to meet the manager Avia and she was very knowlegable and made sure my experience was going well. Anyways, I have come back many times after this for both brunch and dinner. And I get great service all the time by the staff. Great job Ocotillo! You are my new favorite spot for sure.",

Most of the menu is spicy, and when I ordered the salad without dressing, it came doused anyway.  The ribs were tender, a little over charred but serviceable.  Not sure that we'll be back in the summer - but the outdoor dining looks inviting for fall.  Wish the menu had less spicy options for my little foodie.  She is a well behaved adventurous diner, but we felt out of place here.  We don't do kid menus, and the team seemed non-plused to point out the few dishes that had no heat.  Surely this can't only be a child's preference?",

However, the service has taken a big dive. They need a front of house manager badly. The hostess with the nose ring is extremely rude, but she seems to be the only one who knows what she is doing. Tables are seated without assigned servers. This means waiting 10-20 minutes without drinks or placing food orders. The servers do not know the menu. The servers seem rushed even when the place is empty. The bus boys hover around tables not knowing how to be discrete. The servers do not check in on how you like your food (my last filet was overcooked). The servers no longer ask if you want anything else after your meal (I usually do). They just drop off the check and run away. And the stations are not being stocked. No coffee ready for the brunch crowd last week. All of these problems can be fixed with a good disciplined FOH manager. There are also lots of flies and gnats inside the dining room/kitchen area. That's gross. I will probably give this one more try in a few months hoping things are fixed, but if not then it will lose my business which is too bad because it has been one of the best dining experiences in Phoenix.",

The ambiance is great with the wood burning fire pits as you walk in from the back parking lot. We asked to be seated outside as it was less noisy on the patio. Our waitperson was very knowledgeable about the menu, but wasn't as attentive to our table, there were long waits for our drink order and our bill. The food was delicious. We had to have the cauliflower for a starter since supposedly that is their signature item on the menu. We also had the crispy chicken meatballs, wood fired beef ribs, and grilled ginger steak. We were not disappointed with any of our choices. The beef ribs were meaty, plentiful, and falling off the bone. The mole BBQ sauce was especially pleasing. The steak was cooked to perfection and the ginger sauce was just right. We would definitely come here again, but sit inside to get better service.",

The excuse for the noise level -which was off the charts- you literally had to scream to be heard by the person across the table from you- was that two large parties had booked the patio but didn't like the heat so they had to be relocated indoors.  Um...it's Phoenix, people.  In June.  Really?   Both the banquette and chair seats were less than comfortable even for small, trim people and after the \"large parties\" left, the noise level was still very high thanks to concrete floors, high ceilings with inadequate acoustic baffling and vast expanses of bare walls and glass.  I sensed a need for turnover...lots of turnover.  Food was pretty good for Phoenix - nouvelle American but a bit trite.  I've had much better; Cibo comes to mind.  Actually, what I get at home comes to mind.  And my ears aren't ringing for an hour afterward!",

Ten minutes later the wine arrives . Two minutes later the salmon . No beets. When the beets arrive 5 minutes later the excuse is oh the starter chef \"must have gotten backed up at least you got food!\" When  I sent the beets back ( what was the point) the manager saw what happened and did not come over. Finally when he came to my table to help clear it I asked if he was the manager and he said yes. Had I not asked he never would have identified himself . I told him about how poor the kitchen service is and  his only comment was \" they are in different places. I took it off your bill.\" With a manager like that now I appreciate the comment \" at least you got food.\"",

Ordered the egg white burrito, came out with a foreign object in it, so I quietly sent it back. I wouldn't have even added this in my review had a manger done a table touch or even the chef, but the bartender who was appalled took care of the whole situation. Brunch was slow, and in that situation I expect a manger or chef, someone who should have the utmost pride in their establishment and for their guests to at least make an appearance to let me know my experience is valued. Like I said, bartenders, hostess amazing! Management needs to work on guest retention, that situation was solely retrieved by the young female bartender which is the reason I'll be back for lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "What Happened In The Kitchen??? This WAS one of my favorite restaurants with consistently yummy food that brought tears to my eyes, however, I had the worst food and service here last weekend. I brought my teenaged daughter and we were seated on the patio where we were practically ignored. We were between lunch and dinner so could only order off the small plates menu. The duck confit salad was bland and nearly inedible, the chicken wings were over seasoned in a gummy sauce and the flatbread on the otherwise fairly good hummus plate quickly turned to cardboard as it cooled. As the pricing is extravagant for my single mom budget, this was supposed to be a treat. Instead it was a let down. NOTHING about it was DELICIOUS. Will probably go somewhere else that is more consistent next time I can afford a nicer place. I miss the experiences I've had here in the past but definitely felt burned.",

    "text": "One of my friends absolutely loves Ocotillo, swears by them. He put together a group dinner for 10 of us recently for a fun weekend dinner. Nothing special, just a group of friends getting together for a good meal, good drinks, good people. One of the girls and I arrived first to be welcomed with the not-easy parking situation of figuring out where/how to park in the neighborhood - we found a dusty lot nearby which already had a bunch of cars in it. Might be worth them noting on the website about that.  As she and I checked our group in, we stood at the bar to check out fare and drinks. The first thing we noted upon entry was that it definitely has a Mad Men/1960's cool basement vibe. Cute spot to dress up a bit and go out for a date night.  Can I just say how obsessed I am with their Arcadia Spritz drink?! It's like the perfect summer drink for sipping and sitting on a porch with friends. It wasn't much time later [after drinking one full Arcadia drink] that we were sat at a high-top bar and greeted by our server. I really wish I could remember his name, he did a fabulous job. He knew exactly when to come by to each of us with fancy drinks for refills.   My organizer friend highly suggested ordering a bunch of small plates to share among a few people, but no one seemed terribly into that idea. Had there been less of us, the idea might've worked. I was extremely happy that I got my own Campanelle pasta dish with a white sauce and peas. I think it was a seasonal item because it's not on the current menu. It was so rich and flavorful, a highlight of everyone who tried a bit from my bowl. Had we not had plans afterward, I would've taken a to-go box. You can definitely tell a difference between their homemade pasta and normal store-box pasta.   Resident friend-who-is-a-fan also noted that they have great brunch - so it's definitely worth a return trip for that alone and to sit at another part of the restaurant for a new view on their hip dining experience.",

It came with fries which I liked, and those could've been substituted. My friend got a veggie dish with asparagus, cheese and more veggies and she enjoyed her food.

Three different times, I stopped to hold the door open for staff either coming on or off the patio or out the main door, and not one of the times did any of them either say thank you, smile, or even look up at me. It was bizarre. It left me with a strange sense that the staff doesn't care. I hope they talk about this and improve this.

When I took my first bite, I questioned if I liked it but as I continued it just got better as all the flavors mixed. My boyfriend got the Fried Chicken and said it was made to perfection. We've tried a couple other things on the menu for both breakfast and dinner. The ingredients always taste fresh and the service has always been top notch.

I immediately wondered why they thought I'd drive 30 minutes to South of Chandler and also wondered why they were at a golf course on a Friday night.  Luckily, I figured out what they meant prior to paying $30 for an Uber.    The food/drink:  I had a pasta dish.  While the pasta was a bit chewy, the meatballs were fantastic.  The other app and entree that was shared was enjoyed completely.  The only thing that wasn't good was the dessert, a shortcake.  It was very dry.  The menu rotates frequently and the kitchen definitely puts a lot of care into the food.  The presentation was excellent. The cocktails were creative and delicious.    Service: Fantastic.  The waiter was passionate about the restaurant and gave us several recommendations.  He was attentive and always happy.  He's exactly what a server should be.   Ambiance:  The outdoor, dog friendly space is very cool and I look forward to coming by in the spring once Phoenix isn't hotter than the surface of Venus.  The inside is sort of bland.    Value:  the cocktails run about $11, the entrees around $30 but there are plenty of options in the $20 range.  It's not cheap but the quality and service are there to justify it.  This is a great date night spot or business meal location.",

I got the honey badger cocktail, it's a tried and True favorite. Ocotillo is the perfect place for family style dining, we usually order one item from each category on the menu so we can try a variety of food. This visit we got the cauliflower OG, house smoked salmon, grilled octopus, short rib ravioli, and spicy grilled duck. I am a huge cauliflower fan, and usually love their cauliflower dish however this time I think there was a little too much lemon vinaigrette because it tasted a tad too tart. Both the house smoked salmon and grilled octopus were underwhelming in my opinion. I'm also not a huge duck fan, but their spicy grilled duck was pretty good. Crispy and flavorful. The highlight of the meal was the short rib ravioli. Usually I'm not a huge short rib fan, just have had it during too many restaurant week dinners so can be blah but the meat was tender and the white truffle sauce complimented it really well. The dish was well balanced and delicious. I'd go back just for that! A great thing about Ocotillo is that they have a rotating menu so you never know what you're gonna get. Sometimes it's disappointing since your favorite from last time is no longer on there, but you're guaranteed to find an interesting menu and blend of flavors.",

We sat inside and it was such a nice day! Our server at first, was awesome. Hubby ordered the Nutella iced coffee with boba. He came back to us with coffee that didn't have boba and since they ran out, the coffee was on the house. The coffee was pretty good! I bet it would be awesome with the boba!   We then proceeded to order the iron skillet pancake with berries and the truffle quiche. The truffle quiche was good and it came with a small salad. The iron skillet pancake was enormous and it could probably feed at least 2-3 people! In my opinion, I wasn't a big fan of the pancake - it was just too thick and I didn't like the taste.   Once the food was delivered to us, we didn't see our server at all. We ate our food, plates were being taken off of our table, a box was given to us for leftovers....and no server to give us the check! We start looking for him and watching his every move until finally, we made eye contact after 10 minutes of being done.   Our bill came to a little over $22. I love the concept, but I think the service and food can improve a little bit.  Warning: you may get a nasty message from the owner if you write a three star review or below. Because I'm kind, I will not deduct any stars to my original review based on this behavior from the owner.",

Drinks - I had Nic's hard lemonade (vodka based)- highly recommend - it was light and perfect for summer. I normally don't care for cucumber but it was slight and a good addition to the lemonade. Hubs had the Honey Badger (bourbon based) which was also delicious.  App - we started with a dish from the small plates - Sun dried strawberries in balsamico, herbed ricotta, basil with grilled bread. It was SO GOOD! it's mildly sweet and could almost be a light dessert for those that don't like things super sweet! We were scraping the last bits from the plate that's how good it was! Dinner - Forgot to take pics whoops. I had the market fish - it was wild caught trout and was cooked medium/medium well per recommendation. It was light and flaky and the dish had great flavor. Hubs had the ocotillo chicken which came highly recommended and it was on par with all the recs! So delicious! The flavors mixed in were described to us as Arizona on a plate hahaha! Some of the ingredients seem like a strange addition but then it all just worked so well! Dessert - Peaches and Creme - grilled pound cake with peaches and whipped ricotta. It was really good but did expect it to be a warm dessert.  Docked 1 star because the tables are incredibly close together so I felt like I was constantly in the middle of our loud neighbors' conversation and could barely hear what my husband was saying!  All in all we enjoyed the food and drinks! There is a lot of outdoor seating and patio space that I think would be excellent for cooler weather!",

The food was flavorful, but the sour taste the waitstaff left, left me with no real sense of ever returning.",

Which I'd rather it be cheaper and come with less, definitely can share a side of bacon. The avocado toast was the best part. It was pretty good but nothing much more extravagant than every other avo toast. I was definitely not a fan of the pancake, I would not recommend ordering it. The OJ is not fresh squeezed, so I wouldn't waste money on that.   Atmosphere: This place really is sooooo cute, it reminds me of the yard outside or something similar, they have bags and many different places to hang outside. The vibes inside are very different. So it's a weird mix of more elegant and then completely casual which is a little strange. There are not that many tables so when we got there for brunch on Sunday they asked if we had a reservation.   Service: service was so/so took awhile for our table to get greeted.   I would possibly go back to try the lunch/dinner menu, but not go back for brunch.",

Their menu changes every three months or so to go with the season which is awesome! Always something new to try. Cocktails are great as well and bartenders, especially Jesse and Eli, are very knowledgeable and helpful with picking new drinks. I've been here many many times and have always had good service, and I've been served by almost every server there by now! The managers are so friendly and whenever they're not too busy they'll chat with you and make you feel right at home. This is definitely a go to spot in Phoenix for great food and atmosphere and they definitely get packed so I highly recommend making a reservation or else do expect a bit of a wait especially during summer when everyone expects to sit inside! Great lunch, dinner, or brunch spot overall!",

The plus:  -The waiter was very sympathetic and was visibly upset at the wait on the food and mentioned \"how he failed us\"  -the waiter removed items and drinks to resolve the excessive food delay.   I'm not sure if they were short staffed in the kitchen I would say \"don't come to this place\"  I'm on the fence thanks to the waiter he has saved this review.  Good job Ryan!",

Our table ordered a beer, two Spanish G&T's and a glass of rose.  My rose showed up after my food, the G&T's had zero alcohol in them and then to insult to injury the server gave us a 5% discount due to the lateness of the drinks coming but I would have gladly given it back just for some gin in those drinks The Ugly... We sat out on the back patio and honestly I should have said no from the beginning and to sit us inside. Not sure but I just got a weird vibe when we walked out and my instincts were right on.  Service was atrocious and we have had this particular server multiple times.  We were sitting there for 10 minutes before we got water, the server 5 min later but only after we walked up front and asked if we had one.  He half apologized but his overall demeanor was very casual and while he seemed slammed, he seemed mostly uninterested and just overall indifferent.   It wasn't just him though, NO ONE was happy, everyone seemed like they couldn't wait for the place to close.    They need a manager there that keeps things inline, helps servers when they need it, and just overall care about their customers.  The manager on duty (not sure if it was really her) last night needed to quit chatting with her friends at work and manage that restaurant better.    We've given this place four tries now and won't be back.  Lunch service is better but the nighttime shift needs improvement before we would come back.  Honestly it was sad, we've had this particular server multiple times and last night was the worse.   Owners of Ocotillo... train your staff and stay on top of training.  Explain that there are some that saw a movie or a play and likes to eat at 8:30 and while we all know people would like to go home or go out with your friends this is a place of business to SERVE people.",

The tortilla was also very heavy/greasy from being fried, and I ended up only eating half. My friend got the ahi tuna bowl and she said it was good! It looked really pretty and fresh.

I've been to Ocotillo for lunch, dinner, and happy hour, and none of my visits were ever disappointing. My most recent visit was for lunch, and I ordered the cauliflower as a starter and the salmon sandwich as my entree, and my guest got the philly cheesesteak and butternut squash soup. (It was her first time there and she absolutely gushed about the soup and was so excited to finish the rest of it at dinnertime!)  The drinks are always tasty, and they tend to have decent happy hour prices.   As some have said, parking isn't necessarily the easiest, but they do have their own lot and street parking as well. That being said, when in this area of Phoenix I usually assume parking will be a pain and it's definitely still easier here than most spots.  The outdoor patio (and bar) are great to sit in, specifically during the perfect weather months here in AZ.   Overall I think their prices are extremely fair given the quality of the food as well as the service you receive. Not to mention the ambience!",

Because of the nice outdoor area, you would think it wasn't as pricey or that they would welcome after work people at the picnic tables after work.  I went with a large group after work.  Unfortunately, there isn't any type of reasonably priced appetizers or happy hour.  I spent a ridiculous amount of money and unfortunately others were soured on it.  Go for real dinner but NOT for any type of after work or happy hour.  It is a bit pricier than it probably needs to be as well.",

    "text": "Not sure what happened this visit. Been here twice before and usually sit at the bar.  I'm not sure what they were trying to accomplish but there was not enough server presence on the floor. We came right around 1015a. It seemed as if our server had way too many tables spread out. They were out of multiple dishes and drinks that I was trying to order. Which is fine. Just adjust the menu or just do a better job ordering. It slows the server down to go back and forth and puts the guest in an awkward situation to have to order on the spot. Food was decent as it has been before. Tried to modify the burrito but was told they were premade. Huh? At a place that has an increased check average and a large kitchen making items from scratch what's the benefit to precooking eggs and rolling them in a burrito. We eat out often with our two year old and we play the get in and get out game.  We order a bunch of food and our drinks fast so in return get us our check and bus our table. We literally had to get up, go to the host stand and ask for our bill so we could scram.   Dial in uniforms. Dirty, sloppy appearances is a tragedy. Stained wrinkled shirts and hair everywhere on support staff is off putting.  Oh just to hook you up with my last bit of annoying advice...the pictures in the main dining room look great but are hung crooked. So a three piece ensemble looks bad not lined up.",

On my second trip to Ocotillo a few months later, I came in with high hopes. We were promptly seated for brunch, but it took almost 10 minutes to get menus or place a drink order. The restaurant was busy, but in no way full. When our server did come, she seemed very put-out and was extremely rude to us. So rude, in fact, that we left the restaurant. I don't think I've ever left a restaurant after placing an order. The manager quickly apologized, but we will not be going back.",

    "text": "Went twice in one day, who does that?  A friend was in town with some guests and we needed a lunch place. The hotel concierge at the Hilton near by suggested Ocotillo.  I thought I had been here before cause we try everything new that we can in Phoenix but I was getting it confused with another place in Central Phoenix that is very good.  Anyway, after entering the restaurant and realizing it was not the place I had been to before I was intrigued, delighted, and curious.  The space itself is amazing!  We did not have any problems with the service at lunch or dinner.  So for lunch we had the beet and riccotta salad, chicken meatballs, and the pork sandwich.  Every bite including the french fries was incredible!  Sharing was really fun and satisfying cause it was hard to choose, almost every menu options sounded fabulous, our server even said she is picky eater and liked everything on the menu.  So why did we have to come back that evening you ask?  Why not!  We were still in the area and hungry again and there were so many things we wanted to try but couldn't at lunch, besides my friend would not be able to eat here again in probably a very long time.  My daughter can eat chocolate for days so she was delighted to have the chocolate raspberry parfait for lunch and the chocolate pie for dinner with some fried and meatballs for a bit of nutrition!  Great addition to Phoenix area dining.  We will definitely be back but probably just once in a day, not being independently wealthy or anything close to that!",

Its a very cool space and a great atmosphere but a little loud for trying to have conversation.    All of us enjoyed our food but my pasta dish was a little spicy for my liking.  I saw it had chili flakes in it but I didn't think to ask how spicy it was so that was my own fault.  I still ate it and enjoyed, just burned my mouth.  We ordered a single desert to share (watching our figures) and the person brought it to us brought out the wrong desert.  We asked him if it was the desert we ordered and he said yes.  When our waiter came back we asked him and he said, no you got something else.  He offered to take it off the bill for us and that was very nice of him.    Overall a pleasant experience and we all agreed we would go back again.  Its more of a place to go for the experience than the food I would say though.",

    "text": "Tonight was probably our 5th or 6th time at Ocotillo.  The first time, maybe 3 years ago, it was awesome.  However, the last two times have been major disappointments.  Tonight was the worst. We called ahead and they said they were busy, but they could get us on the patio.  We arrived at 6:10 pm for our 6:15 reservation. The hostess said we would have to sit in the beer garden, which we thought would be the large area where there is plenty of activity.  However, it turned out we had to sit in the lonely 2 long table area under the tarp.  There was no one else seated there.  We were told they would get our table ready.  It took at least 15 minutes for someone to finally place 4 empty glasses and 4 napkin set ups on the completely empty table.  Once seated we sat for another 15 minutes, at least, until we finally called a hostess over to get our server.  Our server, Brenden, was extremely friendly and sweet.  When he came we were pretty much ready to order, luckily, as we were already over a half hour into the evening.  Our food was good and the time for it to be served was reasonable.  Had we been seated within 5-10 minutes of our arrival (since they knew we were coming) and had the server arrived at our table in 5 or so minutes after our seating, the rest of the evening would have been quite pleasant.   We are not demanding patrons and are typically quite patient, but the frustration started at the hostess table.  There were at least 3 hostesses standing at the hostess pedestal.  The owner was sitting idly across from them.  There were plenty of people there to get the basics set up for our table.  This has happened to us numerous times at Ocotillo...confusion over reservations we made in advance.  We've made reservations by calling as well as by Open Table.  There has never been a time that we walked in and our table was ready and the hostess did not seem puzzled as to why we were even there!!  This would be understandable if they were newly opened, which by the way, happened on our first visit there.  The owner seems to be oblivious to the floundering at the front door!!   We always WANT to like this place and want to have a nice visit.  However, there has never been a time that things ran smoothly to be seated and served.   That said, the servers we've had at Ocotillo are always pleasant and eager to please.  They most likely have no idea how frustrated the patron may be by the time they get to the table due to the confusion at the hostess table.  There has to be a way to get this down and to be more welcoming about getting patrons seated promptly and drinks served in a timely manner.  The owner needs to get involved and oversee the process!!   Not sure we will pick Ocotillo again unless friends want to go there.  It was a pretty big \"turn off\" to be treated as if we were surprise visitors causing a nuisance.",

When we ordered drinks plus some food, the waiter came back 3 times with bad news.They ran out of sparkling water, ran out of Mexican draft beer and ran out of brussel sprouts...how do you run of out these things on a Saturday evening when you  know it will be busy? I waited for my pepsi for like 20 minuets, it came in a very small glass which only lasted 5-6 sips and never got a refill of any kind. The food was very basic at best. My wife and her friend only ate 1/2 of their salads because there was nothing in them and no flavor at all. Way overpriced for what it is. I give it 2 stars because their outside patio looks nice, otherwise mehh. I'm not going back.",

    "text": "This was not my first time at Ocotillo, and I like coming here. 2 weekends ago we had brunch here and the food is good. They have a variety of breakfast and brunch items. My review is as follows for this visit:  1- Reception: The hostes received us warmly with a smile, and as soon as our party was completed we were given the available options and were seated right away.  2- Service: Our server was very friendly and kind. She made sure we were taken care of, as well as the waters and coffee were continuously refreshed/refilled. I am so sorry I do not remember her name because i think she deserves the recognition. She is worthy of my 5 stars.  3- The restaurant/facilities: I love this place, it gets my 5 stars for the set up. Restaurant was clean and the men's restroom was well attended and clean as well. The noise level can be a bit loud, especially on Sunday mornings when they have live DJ, which is a nice touch but at times it can be very loud inside.   4. The food: I got the Summer Fattoush salad which I honestly was not a fan of it. The menu description was good, and interesting because coming from a middle eastern background I know how fattoush is made but this was a modified Fattoush, with ingredients that sounded good, but when i got it, the taste was a bit off. I also made the mistake of adding chicken on the side, but even just the fattoush on its own was so overwhelming, with tons of ingredients that i could not identify each one by just tasting.Again, the description listed all the items, and i got the dish knowing whats in it, but when tasted it, the flavors did not get along very well in my opinion. Fattoush does not have corn, feta cheese, nor almonds in it, so if these were to be removed, it may make the dish more acceptable This os my personal feedback,  the dish may work for others. .",

They addressed the menu changes (I certainly understand that restaurants do this) and photos, and that I did have prosciutto, they cut it to resemble bacon. What they didn't address was the long wait for our meal and that it wasn't hot. Also that grilled bread is a personal like/dislike and sorry that I didn't enjoy it. Well I've had grilled bread before and I do like it, but not cold! They invited me to come back to get a better impression of the restaurant. Thank you for your offer, but my husband and I will pass.",

    "text": "Second visit to Ocotillo with party of four.  Two chicken dinners, one spicy duck, one beef ribs.  Atmosphere is great, service is good, food...meh.  Pita bread appetizer was pretty bad.  Pita was kind of dried out and folded into a big mess.  Hummus was tasteless.  Olives and feta were good but how hard is it to serve olives and feta?  Duck was incredibly hard to eat as were the beef ribs my buddy ordered.  We were both throwing elbows sitting next to one another trying to cut our dinners into bite sized pieces.  Flavors were ok but presentation and difficulty in eating the dish made it less than great.  My side dish was green papaya salad -- I don't think I have ever had a GPS but this one was either a poor example or they must just suck overall.  Our party was in agreement that the food was \"just OK\".",

    "text": "So I want to like this place but I won't go back. First off I must say that the property is beautiful, however if that's what I was looking for in a restaurant I'd eat at the desert botanical gardens.  Honestly the pita hummus plate was really good, with a giant piece of Nahn. Our server was mediocre at best and seemed to be preoccupied. When the food runner brought out our apps he didn't bother to bring plates. The server also never told us about any specials, which I guess there was discounted wine and happy hour. As far as the main courses goes it was just mediocre. The beef ribs were a site to behold but not super tender and the sauce was lacking substance. The lemon linguine pasta had way too much lemon in it and for a home made pasta was just mediocre. Also, this place is LOUD. It seems to be more of a happy hour, drink spot than someplace I would ever lay down $40 for a meal. Won't be back, your food and service is wack.   Update. The manager that was standing around doing nothing that day, blamed and criticized his server for the horrible service. As he was sitting around doing nothing. Hah. Also the manager or owner went ahead and sent me a message saying I was wack, so I went ahead and took it down to 1 star. Way to go customer service! Idiots will make sure to tell everyone I know how  this place is.",

    "text": "It gets 2 stars because the food was decent, and the atmosphere adorable. But Eli was our server, and I have never felt more disrespected in a restaurant than I did last night. My friends and I sat on the Arik to celebrate a birthday. One of my friends has food allergies, and was asking questions about the entrees, and after she asked 3 questions he stated, \"you get one more question and you're done!\" that's when we started to notice his attitude towards us. After that he started to take our orders, he completely skipped me and the girl next to me, and even though we called his name as he started to walk away, he ignored us. When he finally returned to the table about 8 min later, I pointed to my friend and said, her and I would like to order now, i think you forgot us earlier. He said, with a massive attitude and a tone just under yelling \"No, I Asked if you guys wanted anything else and I gave you Pleeennty of time to make up your mind!\" *insert eye roll* Excuse me?!? It was So disrespectful our whole table fell silent, but I could not.. I calmly said, \"you actually did not ask her or myself what we would like to order, but we are wrong? your saying it's our fault you didn't take our order?\" He said nothing, so I continued to place my order and he asked me my name (which he did not ask anyone else) 2 min later another server walked out with My meal and said, \"your server said you requested your food be served before everyone else?\" No I did not, and we all felt it was a calculated move by Eli to, i don't know, embarrass me? Call me out? I kindly asked the new server to hold my food and please bring it with everyone else's so we could all eat together. Eli NEVER came back to our table, we got our food and no one checked on us for at least 20 min, we ran out of waters and drinks, until I asked for someone to send over the manager. He was very nice and switched our server, and Alecia was very sweet, they brought out complimentary dessert, but all that is besides the point. The whole experience ruined our evening and left us all feeling uncomfortable, some of my friends wanted to leave before the food even came, it was so uncomfortable. There is No excuse to ever be rude and disrespectful to the customer. I would only go back if I knew there was no chance of ever running into Eli again.",

    "text": "Started with the Maine sea urchin with squid ink pasta which was excellent.   The drinks arrived after the appetizer but our waiter did the right thing and comped my beer (he said the delay was because the keg had to be changed).  Mains were beef ribs w espresso mole and Ocotillo chicken.   The ribs (5 meaty bones) were excellent as were the large plate of accompanying fries (served w cilantro and lime - surprisingly a good pairing).  The chicken was juicy and flavorful although the dates underneath were maybe a tad sweet for the dish.   Had the chocolate cobbler for dessert.  Am a big dessert fan and there wasn't anything wrong with it , but after everything else it was \"just fine\".   Overall, a good find and would certainly come back.  Only four stars due to just OK dessert and slightly slow (but friendly) service.  FOLLOW UP COMMENT: I realized when we got the bill that beer was not in fact comp'd (contrary to what we were told).  I took it off the tip instead.  Not a huge deal, but less than ideal.",

    "text": "Tried this place out and it's an interesting concept. I liked the inner courtyard setup with grassy area and a few outside seating areas. We opted to sit inside the main dining area which seemed a bit odd and was rather bright and a cold environment with little decoration, but I think they are trying to be modern.   After being seated it took a complete 10min for a server to acknowledge us which was ridiculous considering it wasn't that crowded. However once we did get a waiter he was fairly nice. We ordered a roasted sweet potato plate that had a Indian curry sauce which was an interesting twist, and a duck confit small plate for an appetizer. Both were excellent and a good portion and could easily have been a meal. Flavors were not overbearing but very good. One thing that annoys me though is that literally half-way through appetizers, about 5 mins in, our main meals came out. We weren't even halfway done. One thing I absolutely hate about restaurants is rushing a meal, especially a pricey one.  Next up we had the pork tenderloins with polenta,  and a pasta with a curry ragu. The tenderloins were cooked well and tasty but the whole dish was absolutely swimming in butter and oil (check out the photo). In my opinion if a restaurant needs to add that much butter they don't know how to cook properly, or the chef or line cook etc messed up and was in a rush and didn't bother redoing the dish. Either way not good and takes this place down a notch. The pasta was good and very different. The Indian curry ragu was unique and spicy and loved it, however the pasta was way to thick and chewy considering the ragu is already very rich. A thinner pasta would have worked better, but overall very good. Desert was a strawberry compote with biscuits and was excellent and not too sweet.  Overall decent place but they want you in and out quickly and the service is a bit spotty considering the price tag.",

They helped with canes and other issues and were just so kind that I hope management recognizes the 2 young men working last Thursday night in the main dining room.

Every plate I have tried here has impressed, and service is always wonderful! Mystic was our waitress this morning, she is super sweet and friendly! I ordered the ahi tuna and charred carrots, my husband got the fried chicken with an egg and we ALWAYS order the blue corn pancake to share (it's a must, we can never finish it and go home with leftovers because it is huge, but so so tasty!). On Sunday it does have a \"Sunday funday\" vibe inside with a DJ so we typically sit outside although the music is never too loud, just provides a nice fun vibe. I can't wait to try ocotillo for dinner!",

Could be ideal for casual dates or a lunch business meeting. The food will impress most palates. They offer many small plates, vegetable share plates and salads that are ideal for sharing- they can of course be ordered as a solo meal, but I suggest sharing if you feel comfortable with your dining mates. Today's house soup was a cauliflower cheese, which was rich, but absolutely amazing. Would highly recommend with a salad or small plate. I had the grilled salmon sandwich, which features a baguette like bread with avocado, well blended with salt and lemon, and arugula- held tomato. I also opted for the vegetable salad, which is broccoli and asparagus charred with lemon zest- I found it delicious. One of my coworkers ordered the falafel, which was handmade and epic!!! Served with pita bread and yummy Mediterranean sauces. The second went with the pastrami sandwich; she liked it but wasn't raving. I would pass for other menu items, unless you're all about pastrami. Last item ordered was the Ahi Tuna small plate that comes with forbidden rice- He absolutely loved his meal.. and that will definitely be the next dish I give a shot when I come back. Unless I come for brunch, which I also hear is amazing!!! Can't wait for the heat to die down so I can sit outside with a mimosa and brunch dish on a Sunday!",

It's on par with Quiessence and Binkley's without the big price tag. The slightly austere, industrial decor is the perfect, casual backdrop to allow the food to take center stage.  The complexity of the flavor profiles was beyond compare. Anyone that understands cooking would realize that the food at Ocotillo is prepared with the kind of precision that only comes without measuring; by truly knowing food intimately, like a longtime family friend.  Chef Sasha sent out some beautiful appetizers for my birthday and Alissa was very patient with our initial indecision about drinks and very attentive afterward throughout the meal.   I cannot say enough about Ocotillo. I wish I hadn't waited so long to visit. Highly, highly recommended. Even if you're not a serious foodie, you will love the experience.",

    "text": "Ocotillo is a huge complex of different buildings in one space. It's so big and vast I almost walked into the coffee bar instead of the restaurant. The interior is sleek and posh and there were a ton of people eating here for lunch. If you aren't looking to have a lot of conversation this might be your place at lunch because the din from the diners was so loud I feel like I had to nearly shout at my dining buddy Merichelle V. in order to be heard lol.    The menu is an intriguing mix of Mediterranean and Asian influenced foods. We decided to split the falafel burger and the Korean BBQ brisket sandwich to have the best of both worlds. Out of the two I enjoyed the brisket more. It had tender slow cooked fatty beef. Although it was touted as a Korean style meat I didn't really taste anything totally convincing me otherwise. Maybe some kimchi or gochujang would help? Maybe it was marinated in bulgolgi seasoning but the seasoning or preparation wasn't distinct enough to make me think \"Oh this is Korean!\". It was served with some pickled shredded vegetables, lettuce and encased in a lightly toasted bun. The overall flavor was good.  While I appreciate the idea of a falafel burger, I didn't really feel like eating one was a good alternative to just ordering a regular falafel platter with pita. It seemed like it was a burger only for the novelty factor. The patty itself was very thick and had a one dimensional texture and taste, combined with bread that was too thick to go with the falafel. With each bite I felt I was eating a lot of bread and not enough filling.   Sides were a mixed grains salad and fries. The fries tasted like the kind of stuff mass produced and from a freezer bag but were fried so they were lightly crisp. I liked the combination of textures in the salad but it tasted a bit bland to me.  Service was great from Patrick who was good at checking up on us and refilling drinks as needed.   I'd love to come back when it's cooler because the patio looks like a great place to dine and hang out. I'd probably skip for lunch next time though because I like being able to hear all the people I am eating with. ;p  3.5/5",

Made a reservation for 2 @ 7:30pm on a Wednesday night with OpenTable. We arrived 15 mins early and were warmly greeted and told our table would be ready \"in just a few minutes\" so we went to the bar and ordered a drink. At 7:45pm I asked the hostess if our table was ready, she replied \"they are cleaning it off now, I'll come get you in just a second\". Back to the bar. At 8:00 the hostess approached us and said \"your table just cleared and it would be just a few more minutes to get it cleaned off.\"  We were sat at 8:10, 40 minutes after a confirmed reservation.  Not a good start.   The waiter was super friendly and gave us a couple of his personal favorites. We both went with the Short Rib Ravioli. It was absolutely decadent...Perfection!  Overall: The place is very cool...big open spaces with some rustic vibes, yet very modern and clean. There is an outside patio with misters that looked very nice too, but it was closed.  The food was awesome, but the reception/wait for a table really made the evening frustrating.",

At first glance it seemed nothing like country ribs... on the plate was a flat-pounded, pre-cut chicken breast topped with apple sauce, garnished with soybean puree and a creamy beet/cabbage salad.  However, on closer inspection their depth of genius came sharply into focus.  This was a cleverly deconstructed McDonalds meal, no doubts. The soybean puree seemed flavorless but combined with the creamy beet salad it tasted *identical* to McDonalds secret sauce. Truly remarkable how they cracked the code. The \"country ribs\" (McRibs, anyone?) were chicken tenders re-purposed into rib shapes. And of course, the errant dollop of apple sauce was a cheeky nod to McDonalds apple pie dessert.  How else could this dish validate its own cacophonic disharmony, except as artistic commentary on the sorry state of food in America. It was wonderfully overpriced, bait-and-switched, bland, over-portioned, and completely brilliant.  Worth every penny of those Michelin-star prices.  Service was excellent.",

    "text": "My husband and I had our Valentine's dinner last year at Ocotillo and had such a great experience we decided to make it an annual event, unfortunately this year was a much different experience and we will not be returning. We made a reservation a few weeks ago for 5:30pm, before they get too busy. When we got to the restaurant and checked-in we were immediately seated, but it was at the table right next to one of the other two couples seated in the restaurant. The restaurant was almost completely empty and they chose to seat us at a table a foot away from another couple, on Valentine's Day. We tried to brush it off thinking they were going to fill up before we left and it was for the efficiency of the evening for the staff, but the next couple that came in was seated on the other side of the restaurant, all by themselves. It was not a great start to the meal which we were then served by someone wearing a zippered hoodie, we were told that a beer we ordered from the menu was no longer available, we were not given the complimentary champagne promised on their website as a Valentine's Day special, and we were basically sharing a table with the couple next to us. I was very disappointed in our experience and we will not be back, especially if this is the kind of service they provide for a special occasion.",

I understand that it's tough with big parties, and can be a pain for servers to make sure everyone is getting what they need. Initially, ordering was fine but when came time that my wife ordered a second glass of wine and I ordered another beer, the wine took almost half an hour and we had to remind him of it, and he had completely forgot about my beer. He did end up comping the beer though. Overall I would probably give it another chance with a smaller party.",

When our check came there was no discount on either of the 2 desserts while the table next to us had a Happy Birthday with a candle to blow out and lots of attention. Max was great but completely ignored the special occasion. So folks be warned about ocotillo and special occasions, you may want to go somewhere where it's always celebrated.",

Well...my keister was bored so I finally made it, and I was glad that I did. The service was both down to earth and knowledgable, and I felt at home from the moment I arrived. Questions were happily answered, and suggestions were offered. When I made my choices, there wasn't an ounce of condescension. There wasn't a dish or beverage that I thought was anything but top shelf (I had the cauliflower, the sweet potato, and the fresh pasta with chestnuts). I was surprised that the vegetables were huge, and how much flavor they got out of each dish. The chile butter on the sweet potato alone was worth the trip. Pasta dishes aren't massive (a good thing), but I still couldn't make it to dessert, which were fresh and sounded amazing. I'll be back very, very soon.",

I had a cocktail there that was my favorite cocktail from the whole trip! It was called the bumble bee. AMAZING.   I wish that we were more hungry when we came because the pasta looked and sounded perfect. Instead we shared two vegetable plates- one was the tomato tartine and the other was braised collard greens. The lemon ricotta on the tartine was brilliant, bright and perfect for the dish. We also had zucchini bread for dessert with these cheese cake balls. You can really tell the owners and chefs are very passionate about food and presentation. I would love to eat here and try everything but I am so far away :(   The food here really speaks for itself. And so does the decor! We sat on the patio at night and it was so perfect. I was even impressed with how nice and perfectly decorated the bathrooms were! The menus were tastefully organized. The plates, tables, couches, fire place, plants etc. I loved this place! They even have an outdoor cat who lives there and I was entertained watching him walk around. He even surprised me chillin in the bathroom. So cute.  And lastly the service. I wish I remembered his name! Huge shoutout to him for giving us the best service on the trip! He spent a lot of time talking to us about Arizona and food and everything. He was so passionate about the menu and drinks and was excited when we picked what we wanted. I had him choose our dessert for us cause I couldn't decide. It really made the visit one to remember. So thank you for that!",

The weather was amazing and it would have been great to sit outside but that was everyone else's idea as well. So we settled for the inside and both ordered the brunch burger medium rare with what ended up being 3 mimosas. The service, food, atmosphere, and location are all fantastic.

It's layout somewhat reminds me of a compound of some sort; there was mess hall, coffee shop and a outdoor patio!  It's definitely different from your average restaurant visit, which you can take however you wish.  I came here for a Saturday brunch and sat at the bar so I can get a view of the place.  I had to order my coffee at the shop first before I sat.  My friend and I always order to share so we went with the Iron Skillet Pancakes, Breakfast Chimichangas, Black Kale Salad, and side of Hash Browns.  The pancakes came with a berry compote on top and served with butter and syrup. I didn't think it was anything too special.  Our chimichangas was breakfast style with eggs, chicken, broccoli, cheese, on top of a green chili sauce.  I would say it would have been everything that I would made my omelette with, but in a burrito style.  My favorite was probably the side of hash brown.  Crispy on the outside with a hint of cheesy creamy taste.  Not sure what they put in it, but was definitely worth ordering.  Finally, the salad was my other favorite of the day.  Served with pomegranate, almonds, parmesan cheese, and persimmons, which was totally uncommon place to find in a salad I thought, but it worked!    Overall, Ocotillo was totally refreshing and hip spot for your dining experience.  The layout is totally weird for me and the service here was friendly and kept a good conversation.  The food is playful and fun thus making this spot a must for all foodies! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "So this morning I was craving something sweet like pancakes but without that fat unhealthy feeling afterwards and the blue corn pancakes for the perfect substitution for that! They came with a gave syrup which is sweet but not too sweet, and the pancakes themselves had a natural sweetness to them. I grew up on the Navajo reservation where blue corn mush is a popular dish, and we have our own version of \"Blue corn pancakes\"so this was nostalgic for me. To accompany my pancakes I got a side order of potato pancakes (they do not come with the blue corn pancakes but I recommend ordering a side of these for any breakfast dish that it does not come with) and oh my God where they <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>!!! I am a potato freakkkkk.... especially hash brown, and might I say Octillo has perfect potato cakes! They are just the right amount of crispy and they are seasoned perfectly- not too little but not too much salt. I will end this review by saying why I put only four out of five stars which is simply because the service. First I tried to call in so I could order pick up but found out that they did not do pick up over the weekend so I had to go in and order over the bar, which I did not have a problem with. And the bartender was very polite and offered me a glass of water while I waited but my issue was I walked right past the owner on my way to the bar (I only know who he is because I seen his video on here on yelp) and I looked him dead in his face and smiled and he did not smile back at me or greet me. Being that he is the owner that did rub me the wrong way, he probably was just busy and did not realize it and had I not known that he was the owner probably would not have bugged me as much, but because I did know, it bothered me a little. But other than that the place is great! Awesome food and a really nice atmosphere.  *** review update***  I have change my review to five out of five stars because the GM David personally emailed me on Yelp and apologized for not acknowledging me that day and explained to me that he was ill that day and only went into check on something really quick and he welcomed me back anytime so with that said I recant my statement about him not acknowledging me. :)",

The ambiance is perfect for any mood and appetite! This is a gem in every meaning of the word.   The patios are great! Can enjoy dinner, coffee or a drink outside. The wait staff is great and very knowledgeable. You can tell they love there job.   Food choices are creative, inviting and making very hard to choose. Thankfully I went with a group so I got to taste a bunch of goodies.   I ordered the mushroom quiche  with goat cheese and couldn't have been happier. The flavor was perfection.   I'm excited to go there for dinner and try some more options. And the wine list...... Anyone that loves a good wine come back as I will! They have so many to choose from!!!!",

The last time I decided to eat at Ocotillo it was during Sunday brunch. My server, Corbin, was so attentive. He was friendly and clearly very knowledgeable about the menu. I'm not a giant foodie or anything so it made my experience a lot more enjoyable and comfortable as there was a lot on the menu that I didn't know what it was. The wine, beer, & cocktail list is awesome. They have pretty much everything. I ended up getting the brisket, and I've been craving it everyday since. I will definitely be back again! Thank you Corbin and Ocotillo for making me a very happy gal!",

The patio is amazing, really spacious and well kept plus it's right in the heart of the city.   I went for lunch and be aware that the menu for lunch is a bit more pricey than similar types of restaurants in the area. As a lover of good food, this doesn't discourage me, however given the picnic tables and outdoor ambiance, one may not initially anticipate this (salads are about $15).   I had originally wanted to order one of their roasted chicken dishes, however I was discouraged. When asked about subbing (mind you also willing to pay) to switch out a starch for a vegetable (the chicken came with rice, potato, potato salad etc and no veggies) the waiter let us know that \"the kitchen is picky and strict,\" so they likely would not do this. I ordered a sandwich instead and my company avoided a more pricey entree for a sandwich as well ( we spent half as much as we thought we would as we were a little suspicious of the kitchen.   The red chile pulled pork sandwich was good. Flavor was smokey and well seasoned. It was topped with a fresh crisp slaw, pickled onion (very nice flavors to compliment the chiles) & grilled pineapple. My only complaint here is that the pineapple was not cored, which made it tough and not as nice as it could have been. I took it out.  We also tried the tandoori chicken sandwich and this was really good. It had a yogurt sauce and dahl spread that went really well together.   It's worth checking out again to see if it's consistent and to see if they become more flexible with ordering.",

Menu definitely has a twist. The roasted cauliflower starter was Legit. Shrimp pasta came with overcooked butterfly shrimp, but besides that the dish was great. My date got the pasta dish with mozzarella and sausage, was just ok.  They must be new. Still figuring out who does what on staff. Awkward roles of the waitress and people literally serving you the food. The waitress asked us if it was our first time there, and how we heard about it... we said yes and yelp, buy then didn't get any recommendations or dinner specials listed from her. Didn't know when to bring out sharing plates, serve ware or refill waters. Again service a 2. Food a 4.   Not from phx, so won't be coming back. Hopefully it gets better for the locals.",

Not that I would complain about prices, they are in line with other restaurants with this quality of food but you don't feel like you are in a fine restaurant. From my table I could see the service area with the silverware, glasses etc, the lighting was overly bright and the decor is just plain,. I think they are going for the industrial chic look and it might work during the day but not for dinner.  The food however was fantastic and the dishes were huge. For those people who complain about high prices and not enough food on the plate, they will love this place.  We had 3 appetizers/salads for 5 big eaters and didn't finish everything (ok with me, I got the left overs to take home). The menu is extensive and creative, great wine list and cocktail menu. I think the prices are more in line with 3 or 4 $$ at least at dinner but well worth it.  Oh and the service was excellent!",

    "text": "The only reason I was able to give Ocotillo two stars is because the food and drinks are delicious.   Let's jump right into the reason for the poor rating, my boyfriend found a piece of GLASS the size of a pea in his cocktail.   Following finding the piece of glass in his cocktail, I immediately got up and went straight to the bar. I explained to the bartender how scary this is and if he would've swallowed it he could've died. I mean, it was a chunk of GLASS! She offered him a free drink and no apology...um what....  I told her I'd like to speak to the manager. She didn't realize I was following her as she went to find her manager. My shoes were a bit tall so I was about 15-30 seconds behind her. When I walked up, she was mocking me and doing a full on impression of me verbatim of what I said directly to her manager. I've never felt so disrespected. I don't feel like I was out of line for calling out a giant piece of glass in a drink. As she was talking smack about me, I kindly interjected, \"I'm standing right behind you.\" She looked mortified. At this point she stormed off.   The manager agreed with me this was a big deal and took care of our tab. Mind you, I would've been more than happy to pay my tab if my boyfriend wouldn't have almost swallowed a piece of glass. I've been to this restaurant many times, have never complained and had a wonderful experience.  It gets worse though! I went back to my table, which was a group of 13 and also positioned right next to the bar this girl is working at. She CONTINUES TO TALK SMACK about me and my friends. Not just for a few minutes for the next hour that we were there. She was literally talking about me to the patrons sitting at the bar. I would've left but it was one of my best friend's birthday dinner and I wouldn't dip on her due to this mean girl making me feel uncomfortable.   I've never had a waiter/waitress/bartender make me feel uncomfortable and threatened until now.  To really put a cherry on top, when our party was leaving she sardonically screeched \"Have a nice night!\" If anyone else would've said it, I know it wouldn't have been rude. I knew she was just trying to get one last dig before we left.   I really don't understand what I did to her to deserve her going out of her way to be mean to me and my friends. We're actually nice people who just wanted to have a good time.   I've been telling everyone Ocotillo is the best new restaurant in Phoenix. This is the entire reason our party chose Ocotillo for my friend's birthday dinner. The food is fantastic and the drinks are even better. Sadly, after being disrespected and feeling threatened by this girl I do not think I will be returning anytime soon nor recommending it to anyone unless they want to be heckled by a rude bartender.",

So happy we did that. Persian cucumbers, shiitake mushrooms, fresh pasta with braised lamb and a whole crispy fish. OH EM GEE. Order it all. Delicious and perfect. We also had a few Old Fashioneds, very tasty. We had wonderful service, Milan is great. The manager greeted us and made sure we were taken care of. We will definitely be coming back to enjoy Ocotillo again!!",

Other guests had the burger (too much bun), but the pancake was delicious from what I heard.",

    "text": "My main thought when visiting Ocotillo for this first time, this past weekend, was that they could be doing so much more. The outdoor space is beautiful, you feel tucked away and definitely not like you're on the corner of 3rd St and Osborn. But it was a bit boring. Albeit I did go in with high expectations, I just felt it needed more atmosphere, younger people, maybe even some outdoor activities, having the outdoor bar open, etc. More of a \"The Yard\" style, but with a little more class. The massive outdoor space seems wasted. Our food was delicious, staff was knowledgeable and we had some good beers. We shared the picnic table style seating with a party of four seniors, the place just was not nearly as \"fun\" as I was anticipating. Maybe brunch is better?  Great food, great drinks, would go back, but not for what I was looking for on Friday night.  -------------------------------------------  Update: I updated my review from three to four stars after multiple return visits to Ocotillo. It really is a great spot for brunch, large groups, and dates. Just wasn't what I was looking for that first night and I still think a few bar games would be a good idea ;)",

    "text": "I have not stopped thinking about Ocotillo since I visited for happy hour more than a month ago.    Backstory:  I travel for work, and one of my favorite parts of my job is scouring Yelp for the best happy hour to check out while I'm visiting a new city.  About a week before my trip, I decided on Ocotillo, and spent the next week fantasizing about their happy hour offerings.  Shortly after my plane left the ground, I was hit with a nasty bout of food poisoning (many thanks to the poor man seated next to me who, after making him pack up his plane-office, said with compassion, \"That happens to my wife, too\").  After a tumultuous morning and lots of red Gatorade, by the late afternoon my appetite had returned and I could think of no better way to celebrate than by gorging on some creative quality dishes at Ocotillo.  I found parking with ease in the parking lot despite the fact that a wedding reception appeared to be kicking off in the large outdoor space to the rear of the restaurant.  I hoped I would still be able to sit outside, and I was; there is an additional outdoor area on the side of the restaurant.    Off the happy hour menu, I ordered the Moscow mule and the baked lumache pasta, and off the regular menu I ordered the \"Cauliflower OG.\"  The cocktail was standard, and the cauliflower didn't do much for me -- the cauliflower, while well cooked and very generous in portion, had little flavor, and the kale pesto set to redeem it also tasted pretty one dimensional.    The real star was the lumache pasta.  I'm not kidding when I say I have dreamed about this dish.  Creamy goat cheese and warm inviting squash combine to create a buttery and slightly tart dish, altogether wonderful in every way.  I was devastated to have to throw away my leftovers before my flight the next morning.  As I haven't yet visited the same city twice since starting this job, I've wondered if I will always try to check out a new spot, or allow myself to revisit old favorites.  Ocotillo has made this decision an easy one, and I can't wait for my next project in Phoenix.",

Yum. The bar provided a refreshing cocktails with fresh fruit garnishes. We will be back for sure.",

We went for brunch and sat outside. I had the smoked salmon platter and my boyfriend and his friend both had the fried chicken sandwiches. I liked the smoked salmon platter, but wasn't in love with it. For the price, I expected a little more. The fried chicken sandwich was lacking in flavor and incredibly greasy... they both couldn't finish it. I hope we just got the wrong things or went on an off day- we will try Ocotillo again!",

We were a little disappointed with where we were seated, at a shared picnic table with some people lamenting their hangovers and recalling some of the sketchy things they had done the night before. Apparently a reservation is recommended to sit on the patio we wanted to sit at, which we will definitely do next time. I had a couple different drinks, the hard lemonade and a mimosa, both were very good. We shared a few of the brunch options including the fried chicken with polenta, the broccolini quiche, and the breakfast chimichanga. The servings were a lot larger than we had anticipated, so next time we'll only be ordering a dish each. The quiche and the fried chicken were our favorites, but we are excited to try some of the other dishes next time! We will be back, with a patio reservation.",

Then My daughter had the Ravi and she couldn't eat it fast enough, she really enjoyed it. My wife had the BBQ Ribs and as she put it , \"Fantastic\"! The ribs have a mole style BBQ sauce that she can't get enough of. I had the Ribeye. It was juicy, extremely tender, and cooked perfectly. The steak itself had it's one great flavor. Then for dessert we ordered the blueberry tiramisu, and the peach and cream. They alone were worth the visit. They grilled the pound cake for their style of peaches and cream and it was delicious. Make sure to get Reservations, they get busy. We had them for 7, and then we're told they need the table back by 8:30 for another reservation. The owner is usually making rounds while you dine. He is very friendly, funny, and will chat if you engage. He is just an all around great guy. Great place, great food, great atmosphere.",

    "text": "There was a lot of talk about this restaurant's patio space. We came in for brunch on an April afternoon, wanting to take advantage of the weather along with some mimosa intoxication. I think the \"beer garden\"/patio section is wildly overrated. There was nothing that was truly appealing to any of my senses. Luckily, the food they serve did not sing the same tune.   We got started with mimosas. They actually serve an entire bottle of prosecco with the side of OJ. This was pretty cool and not nearly as expensive as I was expecting it to be. We decided to place food orders. I picked the Mediterranean board which came with pita bread, pickled vegetables, hummus, dill and yogurt sauce, kalamata olives and cheese. This was actually pretty amazing. It took a little bit of effort to put all the ingredients together for each bite. But the flavors were great together. I had also ordered a side of bacon. I like my bacon slightly crispy so I had them take it back and put it back on the pan to render it some more. The server came back in 30 seconds with dry bacon, devoid of any fat. Clearly, it was thrown in the microwave and cooked rapidly. This was slightly disappointing. My friend decided to get the fried chicken. It was served with polenta and a fried egg. This also was a pretty great dish. The chicken was perfectly cooked, polenta creamy and egg cooked well. They fared pretty well in the food department. The underwhelming patio space doesn't convince me enough to drive all the way for another visit. But certainly not bad food.",

The inside is small but who wants to be inside when you can sit outside in the amazing AZ wether and a beautiful outside patio. Because it was our first time we asked our server for suggestions and she was happy to do so other than she everything is good so you will have no bad choices. we had pancake skillet that was so unique but outstanding. It's a large portion and perfect for 2 to share  it was moist and fluffy the fruit compote was very delicious. Pancake skillet with a hash brown side. Yes please!! Really hard to explain the hash brown but i will be ordering them over and over!  The parking can be a little tough but don't give it's worth it. Also, sit outside of you can it has just a great feel. Before we left the owner stopped by Dave Johnson and was such kind and graceful man. Thanks Dave!",

We were told the entire patio area was closed for a private event but were seated at a small outdoor area facing the street.  The traffic noise was quite loud.  We could see the large patio area which we had been told was closed for the private event from where we were seated, it appeared a handful of other people were seated there and were being served.  The private event seemed to be quite small and located way to the rear of their large patio area.  Our waiter seemed stressed as he was taking care of all the outdoor area.  I would watch him as he would attend to the people seated where we were at and then rush around trying to take care of the main patio area.  That resulted in slow service although I'm not criticizing the waiter for that.  We were also told upon being seated that they were only serving a portion of the menu until after 5:30. I wish they would have mentioned that on their website, we would have gone somewhere else.  I ordered the hash brown cake and while it tasted fine, I was surprised the hash browns were the little triangular hash brown patties that you get at McDonalds or Burger King.  I had expected more.  Overall, we were pretty disappointed with the experience and will not be returning.",

    "text": "Oy.  I really tried Ocotillo, I really did.  But I just couldn't find enough to overcome the downsides I experienced here.  The venue is great, the location is great, the people are great.  But the food and prices were pretty much a disappointment across the board for me.  Admittedly, most of those I've spoken to who think highly of Ocotillo haven't been here for dinner.  The only ones I've spoken to personally have been here for weekend brunch and rave about it.   Maybe that's the ticket I'm missing out on.  In any event, I'll lay out the facts of my experience here on Wednesday after work and you can judge for yourself.  Located on the east side of 3rd Street between Thomas and Osborn (next to China Chili), Ocotillo has all the makings of a fantastic gathering space.  The main restaurant sits right up against 3rd Street while a separate coffee shop and open air beer garden occupy the east side of the premises.  I've heard some comparisons made to The Yard and its open air setup and that's a somewhat fair comparison, though Ocotillo's is more open to the elements in summer.  The modern copper trim design of the building is quintessential Phoenix and there's great energy when you walk inside the restaurant.  I came here with a buddy for dinner and drinks after work, interested to see what caught my attention on the menu  The overwhelming majority of items are $10 or more (including the appetizer menu) so I figured I'd be getting some fairly hefty portions with a three course meal.  Before the food, I grabbed a couple of drinks.  First, the \"#1\" cocktail.  Lemon juice, Demerara Syrup, Angostura Bitters, sage, and pineapple vodka.  Nice refreshing and slightly sweet cocktail.  I also got the national cocktail of Brazil.  The Caipirinha.  Sugar, lime, and sugarcane liquor.  A True classic.  Nothing but positives for the drinks.  Now let's get to the food.  I started with the Asparagus vegetable plate.  The asparagus is steamed and covered in hazelnuts, shaved Pecorino Romano cheese, sea salt, and a fried egg.  It also comes with a side of sauce that tasted kind of like a cross between thousand island and onion dip.  The dish was okay, but I didn't care much for the sauce and quite frankly the portion size was small enough that $13 seems like a pretty steep price.  For my entree I decided to take a crack at the Bucatini Pasta.  Big thick bucatini noodles covered with meatballs made of pork and ricotta, greens, garlic, and a dried tomato paste.  The meatballs were good and the portion was adequate, but honestly this dish was far too dry for me on multiple fronts.  The noodles were dry which didn't mesh well with the dry greens or the dried tomato.  The texture and the flavors were just way off to me largely because there just wasn't a lot in the way of moisture (other than the meatballs).  For dessert, I went with the strawberry shortcake.  I remember making those at home since my youth so I was hoping for a little nostalgia.  The portion size of the shortcake is easily sharable for two.  Unfortunately, just as many of the main ingredients in my entree were dry, the cake part of this dish was super dry.  I get that cake element of shortcake isn't always as moist as other cake batters, but this had no moisture whatsoever.  Had more of a texture of a thick wafer than anything else.  The fruit and ice cream were fine, but the cake part was barely edible to be honest.  Total cost for the food, two drinks, tax and tip came to $85.  Even if you took out the two cocktails I ordered, the total would still came to just over $60.  Truth is, the drinks were the best part of my evening here.  I really can't say I was satisfied with any of the food items I ordered.  Some had good elements, but the execution as a whole was off the mark.  If the high price of a dish renders great quality, then I'll happily pay a little bit more for the privilege (just ask Binkley's).  But based on tonight's visit, I'll probably look upon the dinner menu with a great deal of suspicion if invited here again.  If I ever do find myself here again, maybe I'll do what many of my contacts recommended and just stick to the brunch menu.",

Yea that's what happened... My bf ordered the short rib pasta. That was really good but the portion was a bit smaller than we were expecting. Next time, I'd probably order an appetizer, the short rib pasta and of course a drink",

When I order wine, I feel like someone's going to ask, \"Where were you the night of January 10th?!\" My mom likes to call this vibe: spotlight on the creep.  It's ok. The food is worth an interrogation, and if someone does try to frame you for a murder that night, you'll have an excellent alibi. Everyone will definitely be able to say they saw you dining at Ocotillo.  As far as the food goes, I have two words for you: mole ribs.   Ok, three: mole beef ribs.  They are so good, you might kill for them. Which defeats the purpose of coming here for an alibi. If you're prone to killing, best just to stay away.",

We came here on a whim and from the moment we walked in the door we were beyond impressed. My boyfriend's a chef and it's so hard/annoying to find a place that's up to his standards but he talked about this place for hours after we left. Our server Ryan was seriously one of the most knowledgable, outgoing (without being obnoxious like TGIFridays Flair style), cool guys we could have asked for. Every one of his suggestions from appetizers to wine was perfect. This night was like a five star fine dining experience that happened from stumbling into a restaurant that looked cool and busy from the outside. I can't recommend this restaurant and Ryan enough. So perfect!!!",

I tell you this back story because a lot of establishments (when they do respond) respond with dismissive excuses. The owner personally reached out to me immediately and we had a conversation. He invited us back to the restaurant so we could start over. We went in for brunch and had an amazing meal with amazing service. I'm very happy we took him up on his offer because the food is absolutely amazing. The restaurant is great, the space is inviting, and the brunch DJ added the perfect ambiance to the restaurant. My friends are going back next weekend for brunch and it's now on the top of my list the next time I'm in Phoenix. Do yourself a favor and order the Crispy Pork Belly if it's on the menu - brunch perfection!!!",

The buildings that make up the restaurant are inviting and interesting.  Service was great.  Food was terrible.  Ordered the brisket sandwich.  No brisket to be found in a sloppy mess of HUGE strings of onions and lackluster \"slaw\".  Pieces of what they considered brisket were pure fat with some BBQ sauce.  Came with a side of lackluster fries.  Only thing worth consuming was the minty lemonade.  My friend ordered the salmon sandwich which was also a huge mess and hard to eat.  Most of it ended up in a soggy pile on his plate.  Might come back to visit the coffee bar but only if I'm in the area.  Ocotillo is obviously using its aesthetic and location rather than food quality to lure customers.  Bummer!",

The crazy intense blends of veggies, herbs, peppers, magic, I don't even know what -- which surrounded the main event were to DIE for.  I had recently spoken with a top Phoenix chef who recommended Ocotillo as one of the best places in the area and I was SO impressed.  Only drawback was that online menu did not match current availability so I had to scramble when ordering via phone.  But seasonal is always best and what I got instead of what i'd planned to was AMAZing.  I'm a food snob, I don't give these high praises easily and am not affiliated in any way.  100% recommended",

I decided to go ask the hostess if she could please send a server to our table. We waited another 5 minutes and still no one showed up. I then asked again (politely) to please send someone to our table, the hostess said she'd go get our server right away. He came shortly after and apologized for the delay. That being said, most of our food was delicious! The roasted  cauliflower with kale pesto is amazing! A must have in my opinion. The falafel burger is tasty too, the big slice of beet gives is such a great earthy flavor. Another must have is the tofu ban mi. The flavors on that sandwich are incredible. That sandwich is only on the lunch menu though, not dinner. Despite the service in the beginning, I will be returning. The food was overall tasty! I will add that our server comped our drinks and one of our desserts as an apology. He was great through out the rest of our time there and was very apologetic.",

The one negative I noticed immediately was the noise level which is LOUD!!!  Sitting at the table it was almost impossible to hear others even though we were practically shouting at each other in an attempt to be heard.  So the food....I ordered the Japanese Fish and Chips.  The only thing Japanese about this dish is the fish is breaded with panko bread crumbs and fried for a long time--hence, it was extremely dry.  The \"chips\" were regular French fries.  There was a small cucumber salad that was Asian of sorts, but I noticed that others had the same salad on their plates even tho they hadn't ordered the \"Japanese\" Fish and Chips.  So I can't say that the salad even made it more Japanese.  I wouldn't order this dish again, but would try something else.  Other's meals looked good--meatballs, beef brisket sandwich, salads and more.   One lady ordered the falafel sandwich which was HUGE!  She only ate about a fourth of it.  It did not, in my opinion, look very good, but I'm not a fan of falafel either.  When the weather cools off, I would love to go back and sit outside and have a nice glass of iced coffee or tea.  I plan on doing just that!",

The ingredients are amazingly fresh and the preparation and presentation are phenomenal. Really: excellent food!! There were 6 people in our party, and every single dish looked gorgeous and produced satisfied sighs.  The place is more complex than restaurant: huge, modern, and gorgeous. The only downside is you can't hear yourself think inside the main restaurant.  There are tons of outdoor seating options and a huge grassy area for tiny tots to play.   This place has been open only a few weeks and it's already packed! Make reservations but be prepared to wait a few minutes even then. The staff are working super hard to work out the kinks, so they're super friendly but your order might take a while. I'll be sure to visit in a few weeks to update this - until then, just keep in mind that the convenience factor is low.",

It starts with the food, gets a great follow up with cheerful and prompt service. Unique wine and beers. They get really busy sometimes so make reservations!!! or maybe choose a week night. Eli was our server last night, he really guided us through the menu. You can tell the staff enjoys working there.  Trust me this place is a diamond...I'm predicting more great things to come!!!We love you OCOTILLO",

It was my preggo friend's pick since she wanted us to have a group dinner before her baby came and she was really excited...sadly, I don't think any of us will ever dine here again.  PROS -Ocotillo chicken - crispy and flavorful, I loved the potatoes  -The others liked the rabbit tagliatelle pasta the most, great texture and was very rich  CONS -Service, service service - my preggo friend just wanted some bread and it took us 4 tries on asking for it...3 times to the server and once to the food runner, the female server (Liyala, sp?) was very rude when my friend asked for the bread...she responded with something along the lines of \"I already put in the order, do you want to get me fired?\" It was terribly unprofessional. Also, when she dropped off the bread about 2-3 dishes in, there was no butter or olive oil so we had to ask her for that too. -The Octopus - I am an octopus snob, it was severely dry and lacked any flavor, everyone was not impressed -Pork belly skewers - I get it, pork belly is very trendy now but they over fried it and you could barely taste any of the pork. the dish was served in such a clunky way - there was this massive side of greens that were not dressed and were cut up in either super small or super large pieces...not sure what we were supposed to do with that  The overall energy of the space was very upbeat and loud and the outside patio looked great but service and overall experience is very important to us and being East Valley folks, we will not be making the trek all the way to Phx for average food and below average service.",

It was very noisy on the men's side!  GROSS!!!!!! GROSS!!!!!!!  GROSS!!!!!!!!! DISGUSTING!!!!!  Servers were friendly!!!!  GM was very nice too!

    "text": "I've been to Ocotillo several times and am definitely a fan.  The ambiance is phenomenal with options to suit any mood.  Some areas are rather intimate and quiet and other areas are better suited for your party mood -- i.e. a bit louder and more fun.  It's a bit of a modern, somewhat upscale atmosphere with a patio that will definitely be appreciated during periods of amazing Arizona weather.    The food, I must say, is very, very solid.  One of my favorite places in town for interesting, good, solid food.  The menu is super creative with options for just about everyone.  Everything I've had at Ocotillo has been excellent, so it's hard to nitpick about anything.  You cannot go wrong with the Ocotillo Chicken, a couple pieces of bone-in roasted chicken with a delicious chili citrus glaze.  It's delicious.  And the Branzino for 2 is a whole fish that has tons of flavor - a soy/tamarind sauce, as I recall.  For appetizers, I've had the grilled octopus, the smoked beets, the crispy chicken meatballs and the roasted cauliflower.  All were delish!    The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is that, for me, the service has been a bit hit-or-miss.  The last time we were there, our waiter was a little too casual (i.e. absent and inattentive) in making sure our needs were met.  We were a larger group and the group wanted to drink, but we had to wait for what seemed like an inordinate amount of time to get our waiter's attention and order some cocktails.  On balance, though, my experiences at Ocotillo have been really positive, so I'd give this place 4.5 stars if given the option.",

    "text": "Short Story-   Very Good Food in a Comfortable Attractive Atmosphere served by untrained servers. Based on one visit. At least my server was very inexperienced serving tables and knew nothing about the food.  More detailed longer story-  I arrived five minutes before the restaurant opened and the parking lot only had two parking spots open. As I strolled to the restaurant I noticed a small coffee building and lots of attractive outdoor seating with an outside bar. I also noticed the restaurant wasn't full of guest yet so I wondered why the lot was full.  The restaurant is sleek, modern, light and airy with comfortable seating. The menu is modern with international accents. They feature hot and cold not - so - small, small plates and larger plates that feature many chicken dishes. The plates are meant to be shared so a couple might want to share up to three plates. The wine menu is written for wine dummies and has symbols so a ten year old can understand each bottle of wine.  The restaurant wasn't full yet but the hostess sat us at a table that they were using as a bus stand filled with many used wine glasses. She pulled the table apart so goody-goody we could sit on the clean end. The pulled table left very little room between tables.  We informed out server that we were sharing the plates we ordered but she didn't space them them out and served all three plates at once barely fitting them on the small deuce of a table. We told her to bring one plate back so we'd have a little room.  We started with the Spinach Salad. The detailed fresh salad sat on top of silky buttery smoked salmon. It was a very perfect balanced salad and was very good.   Next was the Japanese Fish and Chips. I asked what kind of fish was used. A trained server would know what kind of fish was used. A GOOD server would say something like, \"I don't know but I'll find out.\" Our server said, \" I think..Japanese Fish. I was eventually told after asking three more times that the fish used was cod (or at least that was what I was told). It was mild sweet moist and meaty and prepared to perfection. The fish was so good I would not have recognized it as cod. The fries might have been the weakest of what I tried as they were tasty but sort of dry and not crispy. They also didn't come with a dipping sauce so they were easy to push aside.  The Thai Style Roasted Chicken was developed with flavor and was very juicy and moist. Perhaps from sitting the skin was soggy and not edible to me but the sauce over it was absolutely delicious. Based on this one visit it's a good bet that any chicken dish will be delicious but might have soggy skin.  When we finished the plate instead of our server saying something like we have many delicious desserts or something like can I get you anything else?........The server said, Do you want anything else?  I do note this is a newly opened restaurant that serves up delicious food. Service based on my visit isn't on the same level as the food.  Some growing pains but a wonderful menu with very good food in an attractive atmosphere.  Slight Update- 11-28-15 Service has improved and the food is still delicious! This is a wonderful Restaurant!  4.5 Stars",

    "text": "Okay, it's unusually these days to be WOW'ed by a restaurant, but I can honestly say that Ocotillo WOW'ed me. So spacious. There's dining, lounging, and bar stooling available. If you sit near the bar (by the way it's a good sized bar and roomy so no one is brushing past saying \"oh sorry\"), you can watch the folks in the kitchen busily preparing the dishes.   Creative dishes is an understatement, unbelievable flavors, and the food really hit the spot. I'm almost afraid to go back because if the cooks are different the food may not taste the same and I would be left like a junkie trying to chase that first high.  My mistake was ordering take out, but it was a weeknight and I was tired. The least favorite was the Crispy Falafel Burger - $14.00 Between the thick bun is a very thick falafel patty with baba ghanoush, pickled green tomatoes, lettuce, mint, yogurt and feta. First of all, why is 'crispy' in the description? Who serves soggy falafel?   I requested no yogurt and no feta. I think the mint was left out too because I couldn't taste any. The baba g. was great and the next time I will ask for extra. It was the only thing I liked on the burger. The pickled tomatoes were just way to thick for me. Maybe if they were sliced thinner I would have eaten them because the burger needed something juicy. I also threw out the grossly wilted lettuce because it was awful by the time I got home. (Now you see why take out was a mistake.)   The side of fries were cut thick with skin on (yum!) and heavily seasoned with salt. They were also sprinkled with parsley I think but it must have been dried parsley flakes because the flavor was completely tasteless and useless to the meal. All I got was saltiness, but since they were so nicely cooked I ate about half.  Coming in third place were the Roasted Sweet Potatoes - $9.00 There were white potato slices mixed in (why?) and also sweet potato chips (why?) with grilled fennel, labneh, harissa, cilantro, and sesame seeds. You're probably asking 'why not?' but honestly I think the dish should have only featured SWEET potatoes. Why didn't the cooks use sweet white potatoes? Doesn't that make more sense than a regular white potato? Duh!   Anyway, I ordered sans cheese and really got to taste that harissa. I'm pretty sure I've never had harissa before. It was delicious, especially with the black and white sesame seeds. It tasted sort of like chili. And then there was the cilantro. Yum! Just enough added to perk up the overall beauty of the complete ensemble. If it wasn't for the plain white potato and chips this would have been my second fave.  In second place was the Gazpacho - $11.00 Served cold of course with heirloom tomatoes, peaches, homemade croutons, pickled chilies, and herbs. It was a tiny portion - seriously I felt robbed, call the cops! - for the price (maybe that was due to the take out order) but it was surprisingly delicious. At first I was worried that the veggies were too oily but once I combined them with the soup everything blended very well.  First place goes to the Chinese Long Beans - $9.00 I've seen long beans in the grocery store and never bought them because I couldn't picture myself eating beans that size, but this rocked! Just about the only cheese I want, the romesco sauce was a bright orange and even though it was smooth you could see all the almond, parsley, and parmesan morsels in it. I will ask for extra of this next time. Wow! So delicious. Plus the beans were tender, not stringly like I originally thought they would be.  I definitely plan to return to Ocotillo with a crew so we can lounge outside and eat the food while it's hot. The dishes were fantastic and I was happy to see multiple vegetarian choices. I think the falafel and sweet potato dishes were vegan without the cheese, but you can never be sure about baba ghanoush because some annoying cooks slip yogurt in it so definitely ask the waiter when you go.   The total with tax was $47 and worth my pretty pennies.",

We ordered the ribs and falafel sandwich, and they both didn't wow us. They were decent tho. I wonder if we got full on the cucumber salad. Maybe try their other dishes.",

I can't even pick one favorite cause everything was great. Maybe I liked the cauliflower appetizer the most. I want to go back here, enjoy the outdoor patio, they also have a fire pit surrounded by couches.",

The architecture of this place is very cool, they have a huge yard with a coffee bar and bar with lots of community tables, it's a great outdoor space. We opted to sit inside since it's still a little warm. We ordered the sheep's milk ricotta dates, grapefruit brulee, raw farmer's organic veggies and the chimichanga with a nutella boba iced coffee and iced latte with almond milk. Everything tasted wonderful, those dates were to die for! The grapefruit brulee stood out with the subtle flavors of added mint. The veggies came with a delicious zataar yogurt sauce and pureed eggplant similar to a babaganoush. The chimichanga had a super flavorful fresh tasting green chile sauce with perfectly cooked eggs, broccoli, and chicken. That nutella boba iced coffee was pretty amazing and my iced latte was great too. I can't wait to come back and eat my way through this menu. My only complaint was that the DJ who was playing awesome music was a bit too loud. We had a hard time having a conversation and ordering due to the decibel, other than that this place was great!",

We definitely over ordered as the portions could feed a small army. A few memorable items included the chicken meatballs, ribs and pork chops.

Just a word of warning though, if you are going to have a full dinner, that doesn't start until 5:30.  Food preparation was awesome. Very different combinations. Their chicken and the steak was great. The ribs were huge and very meaty. Portion size was generous. Drinks were well made as well. The wait staff was very attentive and did a great job.

Well Ocotillo has seriously blown me away. The cocktail I had was excellently mixed, not too weak, not too strong, just right. Then there's the burger.... Amazing. A mixture of short rib, sirloin, and brisket in the patty with excellent caramelized onions and a fried egg on a brioche bun, i believe.   If you're looking for a new place to check out for breakfast, brunch, and lunch I highly recommend Ocotillo. Also, they will be open for dinner starting November 19th.

I show up to lunch with my friend at around 2 PM and was happy to see it wasn't super full, we were quickly seated on the patio as requested and began to enjoy the sun and cool breeze. That was great and all, but we then waited for a full twenty minutes for our waitress to introduce herself, and that was only after we went inside to ask if someone would come take our order. Initially we wondered why a group of 4 guys abruptly left without ordering, but had I been there on my workday and looking to get lunch during my break, I would have done the same. She finally came and was nice enough, but seemed very disconnected. Thankfully, the food saved the day. The falafel burger was one of the best I've had. I'd give the food 4 stars, but the service was abysmal. Hence the 2 stars.",

The space is beautiful, the staff is friendly (though sometimes frustratingly slow or forgetful), the menu looks delicious, their cocktails are tasty, and it's in my neighborhood. If you have visitors in town, it's a great place to show off how hip Phoenix is!  I have eaten a meal here at least 6 times.  But I have disliked so many of the things I've ordered that it makes it hard to enthusiastically recommend.  I feel like I'm playing some weird version of Russian roulette every time I order... \"Is this going to be the third of the menu that's awful, or the third that's fine, or the third that's excellent?  Who knows?\"  For example, the \"crispy\" falafel burger is just very dry and boring, the Japanese-style fish & chips was fun for the first two bites and then the seaweed/salt flavors were overwhelming and painful, a duck pasta and pork pate-thing were [insert sobbing emoji here], but the new eggplant dish is excellent, their cauliflower is awesome, and everyone I know loves the breakfast chimichanga (which the server told us the chef hates making... #awkward).  I like this place for small snacks and drinks, and I like their coffee bar.  I will visit for dinner rarely.",

Our server Elizabeth was actually great up until the end of our meal. There was a group of 5 women who were dining there before a concert out at Ak Chin Pavillion. She mixed our tab up with the table next to ours, called me on my cell, and had us turn around to go back and sign a new tab when we were already on our way to the concert. She apologized profusely, and I understand that mistakes happen, but management took no ownership of this situation. We were overcharged by quite a bit, but didn't catch it since we had split the bill. She was told to relay a message to our party that the previous checks would be voided and to call back the following day to have a manager adjust something off the tab... I don't understand why this couldn't have been handled by a manager at that moment. We had already turned around after leaving, we were all confused as to why we were told to call back the following day to ASK for money back? Furthermore, I emailed to explain and give feedback and I haven't even received an acknowledgment. I just feel this could've been handled differently, and I would hope this doesn't happen for anyone else in the future.",

    "text": "Great new restaurant.   We made reservations on a Friday night.  We were about 15 minutes early so we grabbed a drink at the bar.  I like how open and roomy it is.  The bar has plenty of room and you are not standing on top of each other waiting around.  The drinks were strong and well made, although no one makes an Old Fashioned like Bretton at Ten. Our table was ready right on time.  The dining room is very attractive and modern.  Our server was great at answering our questions and making recommendations.  4 of us started with the chicken wings and the ricotta cheese.  I would definitely get the ricotta cheese again.  I would skip the wings next time and order one of the salads.  The table next to us shared a salad to start and it looked incredible. 2 of us ordered the beef ribs.  They were awesome.  Meaty and flavorful.  A ton of food.  The fries were well done, but I only picked at them because the ribs were so good.   2 ordered pasta dishes which were also well done.  The pasta is made from scratch and cooked perfectly.  Both agreed the pasta was good, but would like to return to try something different like the Ocotillo Chicken or the Ribeye.   Unfortunately, they only had 2 dessert choices left by the end of the night.  That was a little disappointing because there are some very appetizing pictures on Yelp of their desserts.  Next time.   We also asked our server about their brunch options.  She brought us the menu and told us about unlimited mimosas.  Sold.  We will be there very soon to try brunch while the weather is still decent.",

The place was packed for the 11:30-2:30 lunch rush, so if your party is larger than 4 i'd recommend a reservation. The wait wasn't too long for a table, unfortunately it being 107 degrees outside we could not take advantage of the many delightful patio areas available. This place offers new and updated twists on some very common items, and it does it so well!! My friend and I shared several items, all served quickly, all presented well, all stayed hot and all were simply delicious! Our servers were attentive and accommodating. The only downside was that it was soooooo noisy my friend and I were shouting at each other to talk lolol. Maybe if I went there at a quieter time that wouldn't be the case. Regardless, I can' t wait to go back and try the other fare offered! I will be lunching/dining at this place with many a friend in the future! Recommended!",

I'm fine with a detailed description of what will be in my dish, but I don't want to have to read out all of the ingredients to place my order. Name your dishes people! Last time we went, I ordered the \"scrambled farm eggs, blue corn tortillas, radishes, queso fresco, avocado, pico de gallo, chile sauce...\" and it was a pile of flavorless mush. The Bloody Mary's have also been pretty disgusting both times I've tried. Again, really wanted to like it, but it would take a lot for me to give it another try at this point.",

    "text": "This is my second or third trip to Ocotillo, the other times were also for brunch. I really want to give this place 5 stars: the food is creative and fresh (and I suspect local as possible), the coffee is darn good & the cocktails & wine list looks solid, yet, fun. Today I had the Octotillo Bowl for brunch. A bowl of farro with pistachio pesto, pickled peppers, bacon, arugula and 2 over easy eggs. What a tasty and unique combination, it was wonderful! As I said, the coffee was really good (I am a coffee snob, blame my parents). The issue? Service & facilities.  Our server was nice, personable, and quick to make recommendations. The problem? Timing or cadence; we had to request our coffee refills (the first time) from a server who was refilling waters because he disappeared. Later, when I asked for salt & pepper, I was halfway through my meal before he brought it. And finally, it took around 20-25 minutes for my dining companions credit cards to be returned after they sent them off with the bills. That made my friends nervous (understandably). It's a serious trust issue. Our server thought he'd already returned the cards, he said! Then there was the facilities, left behind clothes hanger, and broken toilet seats?? I get it at 1 am on a Saturday night but Sunday morning? Not cool. I think perhaps a little more policing could be done. I hope I can change this to 5 stars, this is otherwise an awesome, spacious, sprawling place with great food & beverages.",

We stop by the O-Togo coffee bar for espresso fizz and fresh baked scones at least once a week. Service is spectacular and the coffee is amazing! The main restaurant is beautiful inside, with a stunning marble bar and lots of windows for light. Recently I tried the pork steak on the \"small plates\" and was pleasantly surprised. The meat was tender and juicy but the flavors were fresh and bright. I could eat this everyday!! Paired the pork with a glass of the red sangria, heavenly! My husband loves the house made pastas, his favorite is the creste de Gallo. The outside patio is spectacular for a nice date night with beautiful lighting and cooler to make the Phoenix nights more enjoyable.  Five stars for food, service, and atmosphere!",

The people who own the place are straight up awesome and are always making sure you are enjoying yourself. The cauliflower is great and at the coffee bar the cereal milk latte and Nutella croissant are killer. So happy to have this place in midtown, great addition and vibe.",

    "text": "There was a group of 18 of us who called ahead and scheduled a reservation for our friend's birthday.  The hostess we spoke to, Erin, was incredibly helpful and professional.  The hostess when we arrived didn't even have to look down at her notes when we arrived; she was expecting us and pointed us to our table.  Wow!  The aesthetic, drinks, and food were all fantastic.  Our server, Eli, was incredible to us the entire evening, offering great recommendations and was funny and generously accommodating to our large party.  The staff graciously allowed us to store an ice cream cake for our friend's birthday surprise.  It was a tremendous evening, and all of us ordered at least one drink and an entree, and we ordered multiple appetizers for the table.  The one major disappointment given the tremendous treatment we received all night came from the manager, Steve.  (He didn't introduce himself or welcome us, unlike everyone else working last evening.)  Toward the beginning of our night, he came over and reprimanded us for having an unopened bottle of wine *in a gift bag* along with the other gifts for our friend at the end of the table.  Nobody was even close to attempting to open the gift, but Steve felt the need to instruct us not to be idiots.  (We had already ordered two pitchers of tasty sangria and multiple delicious cocktails.)  He then informed us that storing cakes were reserved for \"special events\" (like the large birthday party we had reserved ahead of time, I wonder?), but that we could go ahead and enjoy our cake anyway.  Thanks, Steve.  Despite this manager putting a MAJOR buzz kill in our opening round of drinks, we had a lovely time the rest of the night, and really enjoyed the rest of the atmosphere that Ocotillo has to offer.  We will be back soon.  We hope to see the sangria, the pasta, the hostesses, the servers (especially our boy Eli!) again.  Let's hope Steve has the night off.",

It seems that when 50% of the tables are full at 5:30pm and there's a long list of reservations starting at 7:30pm, no one new is allowed to be seated...so, I guess the hostesses don't trust the wait staff either.  Atmosphere is nice and the blue corn pancake is adequate, but I would recommend Windsor, Cibo, or the Yard for a friendlier experience.",

The venue and the food presentation were both really impressive but the food itself was disappointing. I ordered the beef hash and there was so much gristle that I decided to just eat the potatoes and fried egg, and not even try to finish the beef. To drink I ordered the Nutella ice coffee boba and to my disappointment, the boba was totally hard and I was handed a soup spoon to eat it as they didn't actually have boba straws suitable for boba.  Cute place, but I'd only return if I wasn't paying.",

The entire staff was entirely friendly and upbeat, the ambiance was relaxing yet hip, and the patios were incredible! One of the servers, Cole, approached us and explained the concept to us. He was so professional and got us very excited for being there! We sat outside near the large firepit and had Taylor as our server. I was blown away by how knowledgable Taylor was on the wine selections! His service and personality made us feel so welcome and at home. Even with the intention of only going for a quick glass of wine, we ended up staying because of how the menu stuck out to us so much. We tried the brussel sprouts and the pappardelle pasta and I was immediately drawn in. Thank you Ocotillo and thank you Taylor and staff for a perfect dining experience!",

I thought it funny that none of them made eye contact or greeted me with a hello. I went to Yelp to read if it was a common occurrence and from the look of it the service and employees don't have good reviews.   I came at 4:10pm, I called before hand to confirm I could order the Nutella iced coffee with boba... The fella who answered said I could order that in the restaurant even though the coffee bar closed at 2pm. Arrived & they were out of boba... So Nutella iced coffee it is. Great tasting, super bummed that they were out of boba!  Ordered my dinner to-go... Looking forward to the food, not looking forward to coming back to the cold customer service. I will note that the bartender was the only person to briefly communicate with me, she was nice... Other than that, I honestly felt as though the other employees attempted to not look up or make eye contact as I walked in, stood there alone and left. As a 30yr old, ex bartender/waitress/hostess, I've never seen so many unhappy employees. Kinda a weird vibe. Hope someone gives them an intervention of some sort on being more inviting and warmly seeing off their guests.",

We had a 15-person reservation for a friend's birthday at 830pm. It took 20+ minutes for a server to take our initial drink order, and the service was consistently as bad throughout our entire meal.  The food is OK. The Roasted Cauliflower had to be sent back to the kitchen when it arrived to the table cold. However, once it was above room temperature, the flavors tasted delicious. Also ordered the Crispy Falafel Burger - good!  Make sure you have at least 3 choices for wine because they're likely to be out of a couple of them.  Would love to see this place get better!",

    "text": "The atmosphere is cool, urban and casual.  The servers hussle; they're doing the best they can.  The food is above average for the most part and the beer menu is amazing.  I don't know of a lot of places with such a global beer list and they let you keep the pretty bottle if you want (though I forgot mine).    The wings were actually the most disappointing dish we had.  They were not seasoned, grilled and underdone.  Not raw enough to send back but the joints were very tight and red.  They put pickled veggies you'd find on a bahn mi sandwich on top which helped with flavor but quite random and still too bland.  12 bucks for 5 wings - very disappointing.  The calamari camperelle(?) pasta was solid.  It came with some of the best tasting grilled bread I've ever had.  The pasta itself was solid with a creamy tomato sauce.  I'm not sure I'd get it again but I did enjoy the dish.  The ribeye was very different from the typical restaurant steak - actually seasoned with more than salt and pepper!  I think there was pesto on top.  I enjoyed it very much, with the mushroom and/or potato with every bite it was very good.  My friend thought it was too salty though.    The beer list was amazing - the prices seem pretty fair too.  Sure, there's a small up charge but where would you find all these beers outside a beer festival?  Some of the bottles were beautiful - I wanted to take a couple home to use as vases but forgot them.  All in all, I think the pricing is fair and the food is above average.  They have no happy hour or any kind of special so expect to spend at least $20 per person without drinks.  Drinks will add at least 10/person/round (though they did have some ~5 beers like Pabst but.... don't.....).",

    "text": "The restaurant has a very attractive urban/industrial modern vibe with huge outdoor seating areas.  The menu is unique and interesting and the food was excellent.  I was particularly interested that their house made pastas weren't the typical flat fettuccine or pappardelle; they included a variety of unusual shapes such as my baked pasta that had a curved shape with a ridged edge and was served with a rich cream sauce, house made pancetta and peas.  My husband had another unusual pasta shape (long strands with little buttons on one edge) served with a curried beef ragu.  Our starter was the roasted cauliflower due to all the raves on Yelp, which were justified - we both agreed that we need to figure out how to make it at home!  Serve was attentive and very good.    So why four stars rather than five?  Three very minor issues: 1.  I asked for some bread early on, which the server said she would bring and then she forgot.  Luckily my husband's pasta came with two pieces of grilled bread (oddly, mine didn't) so we shared. 2. Our cauliflower starter was room temp, which we presumed was correct.  The table next to us also ordered the cauliflower and theirs arrived steaming.  Presumably it was equally good both ways but service should be consistent. 3. One piece of the house made pancetta in my pasta was too chewy and gristly to eat.  I personally would have preferred a leaner, crisper meat but I know pork belly is all the rage at the moment.  Again, they were very minor issues and we'll definitely be back.",

I can live with okay food but can't handle bad customer service. I had to ask for everything and anything that was asked for took at least 15 minutes before the sever remembered, seemed like server was hiding... The icing on the cake was when the bill came after waiting for an extended period of time like 20 minutes after asking for it and to find out the server added a 20% gratuity on the bill. I questioned this and he told me it was industry standard... this is a complete joke..... as there was nothing written on their menu or any signage stating this. I asked for a manager in which one never came but after another 20 minute wait the waiter returned with the gratuity removed. This place is the worst... they will be shutting their doors soon as you can not provide sub-par food at high prices and horrible food and think this is industry standard. There are too many great places to eat in the valley and this in not one of them... This place really is a dive... had to sit on hard chairs at a picnic table.

It being my first time visiting for both of us, and the outside was nice and such.  I place my order and waiting on my order. I was enjoying my salad and having a good conversation.  I saw my order coming. i ate my small side. the discussions part was, I took a bite out of my sandwich. I noticed human hair in my food, it was gross and I immediately lost my apatite. The sight that kind of questions your decision on coming back and my thought ran through my mind. I felt I shouldn't invited my friends and family to this place if they can't manage the clean food.

    "text": "My husband and I are familiar with Sacha Levine's cooking from her days at FnB. We were eager to try out her newest venture in central Phoenix. The huge space is really eye-catching, and I can't wait for it to warm up just a bit more so we can dine outside.  We've been twice so far, for brunch and dinner. We came at slower times so we didn't encounter any service issues. Our food came out quickly and piping hot both visits.  For brunch, my husband got the steak, eggs and potatoes which he absolutely loved. The flavorful steak was cooked perfectly, and the potatoe hash thing on the side looked sinful. I thought it was a great value for $20. He wasn't that happy with the cabbage salad however. I liked it ok but thought it could use a little punching up. My falafel burger was good but needed way more dressing and/or pickles. When I had the leftovers at home the next day, I liked it even more with extra toppings. The fries on the side were absolutely divine.   Our dinner visit was with friends. We started with the roasted cauliflower which was decent but below my expectations. Our dining companions loved the ribeye steak and pork tenderloin (from the small plates). Their daughter and I both had pasta dishes, and I was impressed with the homemade pasta. My little shells were dotted with kale and goat cheese and swimming in a squash sauce that wasn't too heavy on the cream.  I was absolutely stuffed and couldn't stomach any desserts. I can't wait to try them out with some coffee on my next visit.",

    "text": "Was very excited to give this place a try. We arrived about 20 minutes before our reservation time so that we could sit at the bar and get that experience too. They have a great selection of wines by the glass as well as bottle (although I found the wine key to be very distracting -- obsessed with matching up the images to the key so I could figure out what notes were in the wine, most people probably wouldn't bother). They have a great handcrafted cocktail menu and a cool, clean vibe in the bar area. The hubs is quite a personable guy, (at parties I hide praying people don't talk to me and he has a crown of admirers around him -- polar opposites) so he asked the bartender what his favorite dishes were on the menu and the bartender was quite snippy. Said he wouldn't \"do that anymore\"...the hubs persisted and the bartender seemed quite irritated and proceeded to name pretty much every item on the menu. I think both of us were too taken aback to be upset, I was really amused to be honest. He had also taken our drink order and we thought he went to make it and then came back about 6 minutes later and said \"so what'll it be?\" LMAO. We said, oh we ordered and we are just doing drinks. He said \"oh I know, I just forgot what you ordered\". This dude was a character -- but he certainly colored our experience! Everyone has bad days.  We sat for dinner in the neatly appointed dining room. Love the high ceilings. I wish I could remember our server's name because she was phenomenal. She had great wine recommendations and superb salesmanship. She also made up for the grumpy ass bartender.   For small plates we ordered the Vietnamese salad (a little salty for my taste, a pinch less salt and I would have been raving about it -- it has some of my favorite things in it: shrimp, calamari, avocado, tomato, yum). The hubs had the octopus ravioli appetizer and it was probably one of the best things that we had tried there. So good, rich creamy tomato and white wine broth. The octopus was seasoned and cooked to perfection. Our friends had the cauliflower app, which was like a breaded and baked to perfection with a squeeze of lemon juice goodness. Best prep of cauliflower. They also had the burrata, creamy goodness. The gazpacho looked out of this world good -- i didn't try it but i will when I go back. Looked vine fresh!  For our entrees, I couldn't help myself and went with the falafel burger. I really couldn't decide what to order, there were so many things that I wanted to try. The falafel burger is HUGE, layered with pickled beet, goat cheese, cucumbers, on a nice chewy ciabatta. I put down half and took home half. Solid falafel, warmed up well. The fries that came with it were fantastic! The hubs had the lumacha which the server described as their answer to mac n cheese. I don't know if I found it mac n cheesy but I did find it very tasty indeed. I would probably liken it their version of spaghetti and meat sauce but much sexier. The hubs was very pleased.  We would definitely go back and I think this place is a rad spot for vegetarians as there are tons of options. They have a pretty large space and I am sure that they are much busier when the weather is nicer. I would love to try them for brunch!   Come here, just avoid the scary bartender! ;)",

My friend and I made a reservation were seated in the dining room area, which is definitely less boisterous than the bar and outside. It seems like the dining room would be good for a romantic date, but the rest of the place is better for group hangs. I hope to sit there next time I go, more fun!  The food itself was delicious. I had a gin and tonic and it seriously came in a GIGANTIC goblet-like glass. Like, this thing is huge. Not complaining, obviously! Love getting my g and t on.  The pasta dishes are incredible! Definitely generous portions, too, which makes the price worth it.  For dessert we had the bread pudding, which was also gigantic. We couldn't finish it, but it was delicious. I'm nor a bread putting expert, but this was one of the best I've had. It was moist (ha, sorry to those who are phobic about this word) without being soggy.  The service was also good. I didn't have any complaints.  All in all, I would definitely recommend Ocotillo and I would like to return.",

    "text": "Wow, there's a new kid on the block, but not all that is new means good, I almost am in shock at my experience when compared to other reviews and opinions I've read so far.  Maybe it's just Sunday's. The Sunday morning service was laughable at best, laugh because I didn't want to cry. I wasn't certain how they handle call aheads, or reservations, it was also a weekend brunch, so I attempted to call ahead to at least ask what the wait looked like. Two calls later and no answer, we were already there and parking, but upon entering the compound that is Ocotillo, I found the lady at the maitre d stand, with a phone just below her left elbow. (Seriously?)  I inquired as to the wait as I put the name in with her and was told just a few minutes, tables were being cleaned now. I guess \"being cleaned\" meant 30 minutes, I must have forgotten my English to English translator, silly me. I was unpleasantly surprised to find 6 or 7 open tables as I was getting seated, and the wait had stacked what appeared to be 4 more parties behind me. At this point my best guess was that there weren't enough staff for a weekend morning to handle guests demands.   I ordered the roast beef and potatoes hash, which came with a sunnyside egg, and after requesting the egg medium, the egg was way undercooked; about 3 minutes under. I tried the roast beef, which was chunks of tough beef, overly chewy and super fatty and the potatoes were large cubes about 1.5inch by 1.5inch, this was not a hash. I had about two bites before deciding to give it back to the server.   As I returned the hash, the server replied with a friendly, can I get you something else in stead, which was kind of her, trying to appease my dislike with a different dish, was helpful on her part but I was short on time and wasn't interested in something else at that point.  The rest of my party all independently came to the conclusion that their meals weren't so amazing as to spend the $$ they're charging here, and the wait was over the top. One of the people in the party tried to order the breakfast chimichanga, which they were out of. Their second choice; scrambled farm eggs, was quite underwhelming. Our party also ordered the bread pudding bowl, which was neither bread pudding, nor was it in a bowl. It was tasty though, and had they called it loaf of gooey cinnamon bread on top of roasted apples with cream, it would have been spot on.  Being as objective as possible after such a poor experience, the server was friendly and tried to resolve my complaint by allowing me to order a different meal and the bread pudding bowl tasted good, but caveat emptor to the person who orders it expecting bread pudding.  I can't say that I'll be back soon, but they do have a to go coffee bar, so if you drink coffee maybe you can grab and go from there on your way to work.  Happy yelping!",

    "text": "I've been here two times and had two very different experiences. The first time we went was amazing. The food, the ambiance, the drinks and the server were all awesome. He made excellent suggestions, was totally on top of everything and really added to the meal. All of the food we ordered was also great. The cauliflower was definitely the star! We ate tapas style and each dish was better than the last one! After we left we thought we found our new go-to spot in Phoenix. Everything was 5/5.  We had such a good meal at Ocotillo that we decided to take some out of town friends there this past weekend to showcase what Phoenix has to offer. I don't know if the restaurant was having an off night or what, but it was a totally different experience. First off, I made a reservation and it still took the hostess a solid 20 minutes to seat us. That wasn't a big deal but just a little odd. The waiter who greeted us decided to take one person's drink order, take our food order and then leave. He then came back around 15 minutes later for the remaining drink orders. Also a little odd. We then proceeded to get our food \"coursed\" out over the next 2 hours. You read that correctly, we got our main dishes 2 hours after we sat down. We all enjoyed our small plates but it was pretty awkward waiting about 45 minutes in between our multiple courses. It got to the point where we were tempted to cancel our main dishes because they took forever. They came out ice cold and we just asked for them to box them up. The waiter could tell that he messed up because he brought out two complementary desserts to make up for it. That was a nice touch, but the service was 1/5.   Overall I need to drop Ocotillo to 3 overall stars. The ambiance and food were on point both times. Just the lack of service makes me second guess if this is where I'd want to go for an expensive meal or take friends to showcase the great food scene in town.",

I mean there are a few good items on there, but if you're not aware of the culinary terms that are used in the food descriptions, you're pretty much felt overwhelmed. Pretty much they needed pictures of the food to show what they are describing! I don't like how menus change from breakfast to brunch to light menu to lunch, although I may me incorrect with the menu schedule. We went last time for my mom's birthday, she was dressed in Birthday attire and all, but no suggestion or complimentary dessert for the birthday girl. We chose this particular spot for such a big reservation and not even recognition from the Manager, or waiter even.",

    "text": "Decided to go on a girls night with a friend of mine the day of on a Saturday. We were on Yelp and were looking for a place in Phoenix area since we're never on that side of town. Came across Ocotillo and I remembered seeing that they won 'best new restaurant' either this or last year - so we decided to try it out. I called to make sure there was not a wait and the hostess told me that when during spring season reservations will need to be made 1.5 wks in advance, but since it was Summer it wasn't too bad. She put my name down on the waitlist and told me there was a 30 min wait. Perfect! We were about 20 mins away from my house.  When we first walked in, noticed the restaurant was huuuge, with patio seating and even a bar outdoors! I could tell why she said it was slow season, the patio was empty but inside the restaurant was LOUD and packed with groups of people! We started with drinks - Moscow Mule & my friend ordered Pimms something - her drink was really good! It was fruity and made with ginger syrup - it was refreshing. The server told us the plates were made to be shared - we got two small plates, seared octopus and scallops. The seared octopus was cooked perfectly, but I've had better sauces with it. This tasted like it was latin influenced and much bolder taste than what I've had in other similar restaurants. I liked the scallops though - it tasted like it had a white wine light sweet sauce with it, the basil topped with it made it really good as well. Rock shrimp pasta was our next course, this is a white wine sauce and had a slight limey taste to it. Odd, cause I've never had it in a pasta, but it was VERY GOOD! The shrimp wasn't big as I thought it would be, but it was still crunchy and flavorful. For dessert, we ordered the brownie with roasted marshmallow and graham crackers. It was a huuge marshmallow on top of a warm stone plate. The sweetness on the brownie was perfect, but I wish it had more brownie than marshmallow. I also thought the graham cracker was just o-kay.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this place for a group of 4-5 people for shareable plates and a place to hangout!",

The outdoor space is great for private parties, while the indoor space is very trendy, loud and somewhere I could spend an entire evening.  We started with the Italian salad, chicken meatballs and the octopus. The salad was quite delicious and plenty to split between 2-3 people. The chicken meatballs were amazing as well. I did not personally try the octopus, but everybody that tried it had only great things to say about it!  For dinner, I ordered the Casarecce pasta. It was excellent. Some other items that were ordered...Reginette pasta, beef ribs and the falafel burger. Everybody was pleased with their entrees.   I will be back to try some other items on the dinner menu and would love to come for brunch!",

David, the GM kindly greeted us and our server, Nicole, was very attentive and courteous throughout the night.   We started out with the newly added chilled asparagus salad and it was absolutely amazing. The asparagus was perfectly blanched so that it still maintained it's crispness after being cooked and chilled. We both had the salmon and it was equally as good and seasoned beautifully. Although we don't normally have desert, we decided to splurge since it was my fiance's birthday and had the strawberry rhubarb biscuit and the chocolate pie. Both were good and definitely worth saving room for.   Needless to say, Ocotillo has won me back and definitely deserved the upgraded rating.",

I purposely went in the morning when the coffee bar was open and enjoyed the open space courtyard area with not too many people there. It seems like the place gets a little more crowded than I'm interested in on Friday and Saturday nights. I guess that's what makes this place pretty awesome- it's a versatile space. Thanks!",

    "text": "The atmosphere, outside, is a 5 star. The patio on a warm spring night is very inviting. The inner courtyard looked beautiful, like somewhere you would want to have a special event, but was mostly closed off due to a couple of corporate events.  The food? That's the thwo star rating. A friend and I went and were very excited to finally be finding the time (and a reservation) that worked. Our server, don't remember her name, was very friendly and mostly knowledgable about what was on the menu and drinks menu. We chose to stick to the veggies and salad with the market fish- salmon as our entree. The food came out, beautifully presented, but there was no pacing and it was rather unceremoniously plopped on the table, often leaving us to scramble to make room. The young man who was running food seemed to have no sense of courtesy. We had the spring vegetable fattoush. It was a beautiful salad but really did not have a lot of flavor. The cauliflower is flash fried, then roasted and was better than the fattoush. It was served with a kale pesto and peanuts. We also tried the baby artichoke tartine. This was a play on a tartine and was really just a fancy way of presenting bruschetta, albeit on a large slice of bread. Flavor? Ok, but not memorable.  Now, the market fresh fish. We ordered salmon. We were presented with a flat white fish that was overcooked. We finally caught someone's attention to ask where the salmon was? Our server didn't know. She got a man, large with large glasses, and we were rather off-puttingly told it was turbot. Apparently the corporate events consumed the salmon. We ran out of salmon, deal with it  was sort of the attitude.  We also tried the \"ricotta filled\" pound cake with fresh berries, lemon curd and marshmallow. I'm guessing the \"filled\" referred to ricotta was an ingredient in the cake and the marshmallow? More like meringue but that could be splitting hairs at this point. The cake was dry, we didn't eat but a few bites and there was no inquiry in to if anything was wrong.  I know this was one of Phoenix's top 10 new restaurants for 2016-17. I love the concept, love the setting, but the food- which is what I'm there for- just wasn't all that.",

From the arrival in this amazing neighborhood compound, to the finishing touches of our celebratory dessert.  This was an experience!  So let's take it one at a time.  Outdoor picnic tables, outdoor bar, outdoor TV screens, cozy areas around fire pits.  Then you walk inside to another bar and the indoor restaurant.  Then you are greeted by friendly faces.  Our waitress, Christine, was on point, helpful, knowledgeable and just downright fun.  It happened to be the one year anniversary of Ocotillo so we were treated to an inaugural special of the cap of the rib-eye, a skillet of scrumptious pasta and a skillet of long green beans for the entire table.  The steak was cooked to perfection and we were treated to Walt (the owner/chef) coming to our table to carve and serve.  It literally melted in our mouths.  As my friend so aptly stated \"It's a party in my mouth!  Our dessert sealed the evening, a chocolate explosion of marshmallow, orange and grenache.  I can't wait to go again, in fact, it was decided by our little group that it will be our go to birthday celebration place for all of us and whenever we want to meet for a quick happy hour or drink, this will be our place.",

Was greeted with a smile and was helped right away. All staff seemed to be very friendly and willing to help and give opinions on food. I had the Oaxaca Chicken plate with brown rice and black beans. It was very tasty and served at a fast pace. Perfect for a lunch spot while during a work day. Also got a chance to try my fiances Japanese fish and chips which was also very tasty. I would definitely come back for more and have the same dish although very eager to try other menu items. While there don't forget to order the tea if you are a passion fruit type person.",

She never said \"excuse me\" or anything to indicate she remembered us when finally a gentleman came over and asked if he could help us. I found her to be ill-mannered. We were seated inside. The tables are sort of long and narrow, so to talk you have to sort of quietly yell over the music. The decor is industrial. Our waiter was quite pleasant and we ordered the chili that has brisket and large, fresh tomatoes: it is spicy. It was excellent but they might want to indicate the spice level on the menu. It is a hard place to pair any two items, like soup and salad, that wouldn't take your lunch bill over $25.00. I think they need a fewer lower prices side dishes for pairing. My friend had a green, ice tea that looked good. I had coffee but was never asked if I wanted a refill. The food, however, even at other tables looked really good. It was busy and the outside patio this summer is sure to be a place to be seen. I think they need to refine their service and adjust their menu slightly. It seemed to attract the downtown office crowd....",

    "text": "Great potential but it can use some improvements.  I went for a late lunch, so it was not very crowded, but the food took forever to arrive, even though I ordered something directly from the lunch menu with no modifications. Given the time of the day, this was not something I expected, so I didn't time it or anything, but it felt like half an hour. While waiting, I responded to some emails and got through a big chunk of a New Yorker article (their articles are long, in case you don't already know).  The service was good, but felt awkward: visibly counting with a finger to make sure they were certain of the table number before taking an order, that sort of thing. All of the servers in my section looked very focused and nervous, like they're terrified of making a mistake or something. As they gain more experience, hopefully they will start to relax, or at least learn to hide their anxiety, so the guests can relax.  Another item that may be considered minor or major, depending on who you are, is the shiny table top with all the puddles from the water glasses. No tablecloth, no menu-as-placemat, no coaster, no cocktail napkin, none of that - just one not-so-absorbent large napkin you are supposed to use to wipe your mouth, and I am not the type to multipurpose a napkin. So the puddles remained through the whole meal, which I'm sure is not something the architect or interior designer of this very modern and polished space approves of.   If I were rating on food alone I would give it a 5 (for the Mediterranean Chicken). My overall raring for this one visit is really more like 3.5. The graphic flavor chart for the wine list is interesting but not very useful when it's printed on the back of the list. (Which reminds me of another thing: somebody needs to work on the design of the menu. The font for the wine flavor chart is huge, while the food menu is packed in with tiny font; neither are easy to read.) Would like to go back in a few months after they have a chance to work out some kinks.",

I gushed about this place to my party of 12 for dinner, and was completely embarrassed by the end. The waiter was confused about who got what drink and what food, for which made the paying process to exceed 30 minutes. Word of advice, if you are going to serve a large party, always ask if this will be on one or separate checks right in the beginning. We will still be coming back, but not necessarily with a large group in the future!",

I didn't know you needed reservations so they only had two tables available (although 6 stayed empty through our whole meal). If you go do the grilled vegetables...cauliflower and brocolli they are amazing best you will have. I was so excited about my entree but it was downhill from there...the pasta is homemade but just not good I could say a whole lot but both dishes we ordered none of the three of us at the table liked. I ordered the chicken. I took one bite the flavor was great, second bite I saw pink flesh so that ended that. Our waitress took a while to check on us so we sat chatting hungry still. She sent the manager over, he seemed offended or uninterested or something but he offered nothing...we didn't want to try again. To not give up we ordered dessert...chocolate cake in pie crust and the creme dessert with pound cake bites, the chocolate cake is amazing, the other not so much. I actually probably would have gave it 3 stars but the manager sucked, the other manager went around checking on tables asking how everyone was doing and skipped ours. Our waitress was ok...",

But it hasn't been great since then (3 more visits) because of a couple of things.  It's all hard surfaces inside, and it is so loud it actually hurts my ears.  When we went for brunch, the music was just as loud.  These two things make talking with your table-mates very unpleasant, and it isn't relaxing.  Today we went for lunch - on a weekday when most people work - and there was no hurry on the service.  The fish and chips had good flavor but was way over done.  My salad was OK, but under-dressed.  In a town where there are many great choices, these issues make a return visit unlikely.  I hope the restaurant addresses these things because it's a great environment.",

    "text": "***UPDATE after leaving this review, the owner felt it appropriate to leave a comment, using the alleged death of a cook as a valid excuse for his entire restaurant to not be able to function. Using death as a way to manipulate honest reviews of people's bad experiences at your restaraunt IS A BAD LOOK. GET IT TOGETHER WALTER. If TWO PEOPLE being absent throws your entire business off, you got bigger problems than bad reviews.... I wasn't even going to say anything until I read another review below where you did the same thing to them.  Really wanted to like this place! You can tell a lot of money went into it, so you'd think they'd do a little bit better with their service. Great atmosphere, it is a little bit brighter than id like to see at a dinner place. So we were seated after waiting for 30 minutes at the bar, our waiter took about ten minutes to even greet us, he did get our appetizer out rather quickly but then much to our dismay the two tables next to us, who were sat after us, recieved their meals before us. There was a 45 minute lapse between our appetizer and our main course.... which is just unacceptable. Our appetizer (shitake mushrooms) was delicious. Our main courses, two pasta dishes, were burned and left much to be desired. I will say they did comp our meals and a drink, which was very kind. But there's just nothing worse than feeling like youre being ignored, especially when you're starving and really eager to try a new menu. :-/ This is why im always willing to pay a little more at restaraunts, like for example Christopher's at the Biltmore. More expensive but this kind of experience would NEVER happen there. Put more money into training your cooks and wait staff and less into the tile and lighting! Undecided if I will go to Ocotillo again.",

We were seated right away as it wasn't too busy when we arrived. After being seated it took around 10 minutes for the our drinks order to be taken. When the drinks arrived we ordered our food: the steak/potato cake, french toast, fruit platter and ricotta/beet salad. Our food arrived timely, but without silverware. By the time our silverware got to the table the food was cold (we had requested previously before food arrived). We ate some of it but at this point had become disinterested so decided to take it to go. Our waiter had disappeared again and so after a further 10 minutes we asked another passing waiter for to go boxes. The boxes arrived and within seconds of that our waiter had the bill on the table and it was back in record time to be signed and get us out. The service was appalling and not what we've had in the past at Ocotillo. The food was sub par...it being cold did not help matters.",

For whatever reason card didn't show up, owner persisted in sending another card and I have to give kudos to any business person who cares enough about their customers to ensure they are satisfied.  They obviously value what customers think as their concern with a low rating is valid in such a competitive industry.  Walt and David appear to care about their customers, and that should result in a good experience and tasty food.",

    "text": "Janice Eddington 12 hrs   Well it may only be 4:45pm here in Phoenix, but my tummy is still on Dallas time which is 6:45pm. It is time to eat! I picked Ocotillo. We arrive and are seated inside. The interior is clean and simple and the photography on the walls by Mike Olbinski is outstanding. Danny comes by to give us water and to let us know that Alyssa will be with us shortly to take our order. But if we need anything he and his friend Ryan will be there to take care of us too. Ryan loves his job, he and Ryan both have the logo of Ocotillo tattooed behind their ear. He says it is the best job he has ever had! Alyssa is our waitress. She explains that happy hour runs until 6, we can order from the happy hour menu until 6 or off the dinner menu from the salad, vegetables and smalls, but cannot order from the Pasta or Large plates until 5:30pm. Well crap, I would have made my reservation for 5:30 had I know that. Oh well, that is ok, I want to try the \"Spicy Japanese Beef Curry\" and why not go ahead and get the \"Roasted Brussel Sprouts\" now, instead of with my meal.  Terry and I chat while we wait for our appetizers.  They arrive... they smell soooo good. We dig in. At the first bite I tell my husband to STOP! This is too good. I need photos (we have not had a meal worthy of photos in about a year). So you will have to excuse me, the first two dishes are being eaten! And the camera is not going to be put down, this is one serious meal, worthy of photos to rub everyone's face in the fact that WE ate this meal. Sorry friends you know this is how I get when a restaurant is outstanding. You know it has to be outstanding for me to even think about pulling out the camera, which was not my intent, I was shooting a beautiful sunset after dinner to night and didn't want to leave the camera in the car.  Because you all know what happened last time I left the camera in the car here in AZ! And this is going to be one I wish I had full gear to do the food justice.  Terry and I agree that it is between the \"Beef Ribs\" and the \"Pork Shank\". When they were delivered to the table Terry took the ribs and I took the Pork thinking that we would switch half way sharing them both. First bite and I am not saying a word, but I am thinking DAMN, I don't want to share. Then Terry gives me a bite of his ribs, that Mole Express BBQ sauce is outstanding, I think, OK if I have to split it will be ok, but I really don't want to. I eat half of my \"pork Shank\". Because now I am worried that maybe we are missing out on something else great on the menu. The \"Ocotillo Chicken\". I tell Terry, \"We NEVER do this, but I am worried we are missing out. Shall we stop eating and order the Chicken?\" He agrees...(we had better watch out or Alyssa is going to get tired of boxing our food!) I can only image what is going through Alyssa's head. She must think we are crazy. The chicken comes, OH MAN it is so good and served on top of Date-Potatoe Salad that is so amazing together. We only take two bites each and yes, have Alyssa Box it for us.  And then she asks, \"Would you like to see the desert menu?\" And in my head starts an argument, you don't need it vs you know it will be worth every calorie. I look at Terry and the look he is giving me is the same argument going on in his head. \"Yes, please, we would like to see the desert menu.\" And you will have to forgive me I do not remember all three choices, Some kind of chocolate cake, Pumpkin Donuts with a chocolate sauce and ice cream or a Pineapple ?? Tart with Brown Butter Ice Cream and ?? Sauce over it. Gee can you tell which one we ordered? Yup, Pumpkin Donuts, Alyssa, Ryan and Danny all said they were the best. Now here I will say is where service went a little wrong. When desert was delivered, it look so good, I took the image and we both dug in! and about 3 bites later, I go, \"there is fruit on this, Terry goes, \"yes pineapple\". This is not pumpkin donuts. Now I could have complained, but how could I, because this was what I really wanted! I wanted that yummy Browned Butter ice cream, and I might have eaten more that my share of it! No, Alyssa did not make a mistake, our bill said Pumpkin Donuts. Guys this was a dinner to remember, Alyssa, Danny and Ryan made our dinner special. And I thank them for that. Danny was so nice, I asked if I could take his photo. He said it made him feel special. And here he was the one making us feel special along with Alyssa and Ryan. Executive Chef Walter Sterling and Chef de Cuisine Brendan Lee also deserve a job well done, you made it hard to choose what to eat or maybe what not to eat . I love it when you leave wondering which was better the food or the service.",

Pork ribs for appetizer, which were super tender. I would of just liked more glaze, but that's more a personal preference. Still very good! I got the grilled shrimp and my fiance got the crab pasta. I liked the fact that they had quite a few seafood options. We both ate our entire meals, so no issue on how they tasted.  We sat for a little, I mentioned it was his birthday and they offer a mini cupcake on the house with berries. It hit the spot. Jesse was helpful and attentive--never lacking anything:)   I loved how the restaurant was set up, open and with lights up the walkway. We chose to sit inside but there was plenty of outdoor sitting. My only thing would be that the lights over the bar were a little too bright for my liking. Other then that, a very nice place.",

If you go here make sure to order the carrots, beets, and cauliflower. Those were our favorites.   The second round of food was also very good. We had the chicken wings which were very enjoyable as well as the cheese plate which was fantastic.   The final round of food were the large plates where we had the ribeye, ribs, and duck. The steak was great however the ribs and duck were disappointing. Both of the ribs and the duck were much too over seasoned and the meat couldn't even be tasted because of the over seasoning.

Their sangria consisted of 2 blueberries, half an orange slice, 1/2 a disintegrated rasperberry, 1 bottle of $5 dollar bottle of cheap white wine labeled \"sangria\".  Over about 1/ 2 gal of ice. It was $18 and so bad thayt I had to add about 4 limes to drink my 1 and only glass.   Stick with the overpriced beers on the patio.",

I said but what's for dinner tonight, she said let's try Ocotillo to it and someplace else for brunch Sunday. I agreed.   I don't remember the wine we ordered that event no but we shared the buffalo wings, spare ribs and braised greens. Everything, everything was off. I won't say wrong because I'm not sure but very thing was definitely off. The buffalo wings were way to chewy, big, slimy and slightly cold on the inside, all of which meant they weren't cooked long enough. Same with the ribs, however we believe they were cooked a little too long, and wayyyy before we ordered them. Like perhaps they were cooked earlier, then when we ordered them they threw them in the cast iron skillet to heat them out.   When the server brought them out and said be careful the plate is really hot. We carefully put one rib on our plate with a fork. I picked mine up to bite and realized it was not as hot as I thought it would be. I took one bite and for sure, it was kinda cool too! That was enough for me to not want to try them for brunch or dinner again for that matter.",

    "text": "I would love it if I could have Octotillo for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner on the daily!  The choices and uniqueness to each individual item on the menus make it difficult for me to choose what I want. This in itself already made it a quick decision to come back here again and again. Everything just looks so good!  Even the vegetable list - I was willing to try all of it. It might be best to share several appetizers and entrees.   This particular visit was a brunch visit - perfect weather, lighting, and ambiance made for a lovely brunch experience.   I was impressed with our server who explained the dishes with detail and professionalism. It was so great that I almost wanted to hear it again. Or maybe I was just hungry - ha!  We ended up trying the smoked beets and grilled acorn squash off the vegetable options. The smoked beets is a gluten-free option. You gets the red and autumn orange colored beets with baby arugula, ricotta, pistachios and then drizzled with a special truffle honey. Those are all ingredients I love - so naturally I liked it!   The grilled acorn squash is something I usually don't have.  It was complimented with pumpkin seed mole, dates, tamarind, and other herbs. Sounds strange, ended up being a veggie delight.  From the Light - we tried the prosciutto di Parma - a nice serving of prosciutto. You simply add all ingredients Buratta, pumpkin conserva, baby arugula, and place it atop a crunchy garlic crostini.   And to the Savory section: Grilled Beef Rib Breakfast and the Baked Lumache Pasta. Really wanted to try the crispy duck wings, but sadly they were out of it! Sad face.  Moving on, the 2 meaty grilled beef ribs were presented on a nice big wooden cutting board that came with scrambled eggs and hash brown cakes with jalapeno chimichurri.  Tasty! Also gluten free.  The baked lumache pasta came with roasted squash, braised greens, herbs and goat cheese.  Still flavorful for something meatless.   No desserts this round, but we did not forget drinks. Tried the Frose (White Zifendel mix) and the Melon Patch, which are offered at brunch. I did not think they were too sweet. Gives a nice refreshing buzz after!  Dinner here was also great! But that memory was a while ago..fish and desserts.  Cauliflower OG is also delicious and nutritious.   Can't wait to return!",

We had a variety of dishes at our table so we were able to try quite a few things. One of our favorites was the eggplant meatballs which were to die for as the polenta under it was amazing!! I had the scallops for dinner and was a bit disappointed as I got 5 pieces of scallops and 3 pieces of fennel. However, I get that the scallops are hard to cook so the five I got were perfect! So the portion on scallops was very small but I nibbled on some other dishes at the table which helped my appetite subside. However, many friends got the rib eye and chicken dish which was delicious they said and the pasta was good according to my dinner buddies :) I would come back here as it's a cool spot with a great outdoor patio area and nice indoor area where we sat as it was 105 degrees! The parking alongside the street and parking behind the restaurant was ample for us all to find a spot. The service was good and they tried there best to get everything out as quickly as possible. The ambiance of the establishment was nice and looking around you could see a variety of people there celebrating or just enjoying a night out! We came on a Wednesday and had a reservation so we were immediately seated when we arrived.",

Outside bar and seating as well. Prices are moderate but large portions and all good.",

One patio is for smaller parties and the other patio is perfect for large parties and celebrations. In addition, there is indoor seating and a large bar.   My favorite dish is the Cauliflower OG. It is served with a kale pesto that I could eat everyday. It's fresh and is the perfect compliment to the charred cauliflower. The Chicken Skewers are also wonderful. The seasoning is flavorful and has an Indian flare.   Their adult beverages are well balanced and they have a a nice variety of different cocktails.   Ocotillo is a little bit pricey, especially if you are going to indulge in libations. I recommend going for brunch or happy hour to save a few bucks.",

This is fine dining and fancy feasting without draining your savings! Fun to pop in for cocktails/bites to share, weekend brunch plans, a solid lunch or dinner menu, for outoftowners/business/special occasions, even events and private activities~ Their seasonal menus keep us coming back for more (and missing some of our faves!)

This particular time we found a place we had book marked a couple of weeks prior in our Yelp account of course!  It was easy to find.  I've probably driven by there so many times, probably on our way to another brunch spot and didn't even realize it was there.  So glad I do now!!  We started with amazing cocktails.  After all, what is brunch without Mimosas and Bloody Marys??  They were just how we like them.  They were exactly what we always look for, actual flavor, not watered down sugar water.  So goooood!!!!  The food was perfection! You know me and my steak it was like I was being presented with a gift.  I loved the presentation.  My meal was so good, I use it as one of my photos in my Yelp profile.  Our server was super nice.  The atmosphere was super trendy for a Sunday morning, although you could see every age group covered.  Love the cool music. The outside patio was great for the families and their kids.  I can also see a birthday party happening there, especially with the great weather AZ has, it is an awesome spot all around!  We highly recommend Ocotillo.",

There were many pretty plants and trees around.  We had the breakfast chimichanga and the rotating iron skillet pancake (gingerbread flavor) The chimichanga is big enough for 2 people. Crispy outside with delicious chicken inside, the salsa verde was good too. I didn't really care for the fried egg inside but all and all pretty good. I was a little apprehensive about the gingerbread pancake but NO regrets. Again that pancake is big enough to share. The flavor was just awesome: not overwhelming at all. It comes with syrup and a vanilla cream spread. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. You just have to try it.  Looking forward to trying other items on their menu.",

The table next to us did notice and comment about how long their food was taking, but usually there is some wait time for this food. While the food is good, I cannot said either time I was here my food was hot when it reached the table. He enjoyed a Manhattan, and I had the ginger mint lemonade, then we split the roasted sweet potato with avocado, Roasted cauliflower, the falafel, chestnut ravioli, another pasta dish with shrimp in a cream sauce and then the ribeye.  Again, the food was good, and it's made with good ingredients. I know what I'm eating was made well, I just feel it's a little overpriced for what it is. Again, I enjoy coming here, specially when you want a nice outing or date.",

    "text": "We often drive down 3rd street on the way to downtown. In the past, our perpetual proclamation was that one day, we'll dine at Ocotillo! It looked so intriguing from the outside. With it's seemingly modern decor, and inviting atmosphere, it just seemed like such an ideal place for a get together.  We finally got the opportunity as we were invited to another performance of the Downtown Chamber series by a friend. Since he was kind enough to invite us to the performance, we wanted to return his kindness with a fabulous dinner.  He asked where we would like to meet. Our immediate and unequivocal choice?  Ocotillo!  It was a hot Saturday afternoon when we first arrived there. The grounds are quite inviting. This restaurant is a complex of differing buildings. Within its exterior grounds are benches and play areas, adorned with some small garden areas. They are quite inviting, but definitely not enjoyable in the heat.  As you walk inside, you're presented with a posh and modern interior.  Even though it was mid-afternoon, the place was bustling with activity. We were seated right away, and Julian introduced himself, as he was to be our server.  Ocotillo bills itself as a restaurant that focuses on New American seasonal, with a touch of Arizona influence, and we absolutely and wholeheartedly agree.  For starters, we had the Fattoush Salad. Every aspect of this salad was so fresh, and blended so well with each other. Each and every bite was a delight to our palates, and brought us to a seemingly heavenly trip through a vegetable garden.   For our entrees, we had (and shared) the Pappardelle, the Chittara Pasta (with clams), and the Short Rib Ravioli! Every bite was utterly sublime. Part of our goal was to make an impression with our Foodie friend who travels extensively; yet he is not entirely familiar with the best of the local Phoenix food scene  After we were done, he couldn't help but acknowledge that Ocotillo is definitely up there based on its service (Julian was outstanding), and it's inventive and spectacular cuisine offerings.  About the only complaint he had, that we echoed as well, was the fact that this place gets loud and noisy. It was quite a challenge to have a prolonged and coherent conversation due to the noise level. Next time we dine here, if it's cool enough, we will opt to enjoy ourselves outside!",

I will be back, simply because of the environment and the Micheladas but may not spend my money on the food. 1. Brisket - no flavor and not properly cooked. I shouldn't need a knife to cut through brisket, it should fall apart on its own. 2. Fried chicken - chicken nor batter were seasoned.  Needs some punch! 3. Banana skillet pancake - just ok. 4. Stuffed French toast - by far, the best tasting plate on our table bit was still just average.  5. Hot fries - I would order these again. Nice and crispy on the outside and soft inside.",

They offer high-quality coffee, I just wish the person working in the bar/shack/thing knew what he was doing because it was clear he has no experience serving coffee. I ended up getting a tea to play it safe but overall, I wouldn't visit this part of Ocotillo again.  As for the actual restaurant, again, very slow service. Our server was moping around, no sense of urgency and gave a really bad impression. I was a server for many years and this guy was not cutting it.  As for the food, I ordered the Oaxaca half chicken and boy was it delicious. The mole sauce on the chicken had an awesome flavor, the chicken was tender and a great portion. The black beans were good and the cilantro lime rice was solid. The rice had A LOT of lime in it (which I enjoy) but others may not.  The grounds around the restaurant are very well kept and look very nice. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice but didn't flow well with the grounds of the entire restaurant area. The restaurant felt more... formal.  I won't go out of my way to come back here but if friends invite us, I'd be back strictly for the food.",

Please carry some less expensive choices. Oh, and the pasta with red sauce and shrimp:  I've had this twice. I was fighting off a migraine on the first time, but ordered again in compis mentis and it was still awful. Burned (\"baked\") garlic dominates the tasteless shrimp. I love fresh, not burned garlic. This recipe should tilt towards the sweetness of shrimp and tomato, maybe sun dried would strengthen the sweet.  Thanks for the attractive spacious outdoor venue! I'll be back when baked cauliflower is in season.",

My nose and eyes spotted a beautiful looking pasta dish and asked what's that? I then was greeted and introduced to Martin a very friendly and insightful young man. Martin not only answered my question but he gave me the history of the Resturant and the philosophy of the chef and then introduced me to their lovely staff and finely some of the most interesting and freshest tastes this pallet of mine has experienced in many of year. I don't believe you could go wrong with any of the choices on their menu. This is one of those rare finds. A place where you can actually taste the love in every bite.",

    "text": "I went to Ocotillo for the first time a week ago and was very disappointed. We were seated after a short wait (although there were no other people waiting and the restaurant wasn't full). We were then forgotten about completely. No one came to offer us drinks or take our order so I got up and asked the first employee I saw.  He apologized and immediately helped us. Unfortunately, he didn't seem to be very knowledgeable about vegan options so I had to ask him to clarify with the chef, as most places usually do. When he returned he told me the options and modifications I can make so we went with the roasted cauliflower and falafel burger.  After I got the cauliflower I noticed a green looking pesto, which I presumed contained cheese. He said they would use a carrot pesto so I was alarmed when it was not orange. So I let the dish get cold as I waited for him to come by so that I could ask. Well, he didn't come by for quite a while so I got up and asked the hostess--who happened to be vegan--what color it was supposed to be, she said orange.  I go back to my table and wait some more until our waiter finally comes by again and says that it's a carrot TOP pesto and that it's supposed to be green and the hostess didn't know what she was talking about.  At this point my cauliflower is cold but to be honest it was nothing special. I make better roasted cauliflower at home. It was pretty though. Too lemony for me. The falafel burger--when made vegan--is too dry so we added avocado but it still was dry.  And let's talk about the decor: BORING! White walls, bright lights?! It was a little \"old\" for us. We won't be returning and don't really recommend it to others.   P.s. Drinks were okay.",

Great architecture and layout, beautiful dining room and fun community beer garden. We sat at the bar while we waited for a table to open up. We had two signature cocktails, a play on a banana daiquiri and a grilled pineapple infused vodka martini. Both phenomenal.   When we sat for dinner our server started us off with a couple appetizers, one was a roasted Cauliflower with an Aleppo pepper vinaigrette. To die for! For our main course we decided to do family style per our servers suggestion, allowing us to try more than one dish. My favorite was the whole crispy sea bass. Two thumbs up!!  Ocotillo is one of my favorite spots in the Phoenix area, And I love bringing new friends to show off this place.",

    "text": "We had an awesome lunch at ocotillo this week! We brought my parents who were visiting from out of town - they love trying new and inventive things, and ocotillo certainly delivered.   Our server Josh gave us the run down on the menu and recommended a few of the house favorites. From the small plates, we tried the hand pulled mozzarella, roasted cauliflower and the roasted beets.   The mozzarella was served with pickled carrots and a carrot top pesto that was refreshingly tangy and the spice paired so well with the coolness of the mozzarella. The pink peppercorns on top just added the perfect extra hint of salty heat for the dish.   The roasted cauliflower was the star of the meal, I think. The flavor they packed into the cauliflower was just nuts. It was like this peanut roasted balsamic sauce with fresh pesto and chili peppers - it was so, so good.   The roasted beets were great too! There were a multitude of different ones to try all on a bed of whipped herbed ricotta that was amazing.   I got the tofu bahn mi, mom got the Japanese fish and chips, dad got the smoked salmon salad and my husband got the Peruvian chicken. Everything looked delicious and tasted even better! I loved the peanut sauce on my sandwich, moms fish was perfectly lightly fried, dads salad was refreshing, and my husbands chicken just pushed the limits on spice to be interesting and tasty. I also have to mention their lemonade - the ginger, lemongrass and mint make it so refreshing and delicious on a warm day. I always get one to go.   We sat outside on the covered patio by the bar and loved it. Such a perfect way to enjoy the Phoenix spring. Definitely stop by for brunch, lunch or dinner!   Oh - I have to give a hat tip to their coffee bar too. They're serving up sightglass beans and creating delicious drinks (and it opens super early!). Worth stopping by and getting out of the car for a cup of coffee instead of driving by the closest Starbucks. Give it a try, especially if Liden is on the bar!",

We arrived at around 10:30, well before the busy brunch scene. We were greated by 2 young, condescending, and rude hostesses. Who told us that every table in the restaurant was either occupied or reserved. The restaurant was half empty at this point. We didn't make a big deal of this seemingly improbable statement. We simply asked what were our options. We were told we could order from the full menu at the coffee shop area or the bar. Quite dismissively I must say. With no explanation as to where any of these areas were located. We wondered around the property which is pretty large and sprawling with every staff encounter just as rude as the first. Finally were told by 1 wait person that he would help us but we had to sit in area of couches that had zero shade from the already blazing Phoenix sun. Keep in mind we passed numerous empty tables. We simply got tired of being treated like dirt and decided to take our business elsewhere.  It's a beautiful restaurant with seemingly good food, but the staff has no idea what hospitality service is. I couldn't leave without at least speaking my mind to the hostess. I simply had to tell her that she was quite rude and perhaps needed to reevaluate the way she speaks to guests of the restaurant. I was very polite even though she deserved a bit more direct speech. She didn't even try to offer an apology of any kind. Could not care less.   If you are an owner or manager of this restaurant and read this. Perhaps you should look at who you place at the door of your establishment. I wouldnt want the 2 who greated us on Sunday to be my representative.",

    "text": "Went to dinner with a friend who had been here for brunch. The cauliflower appetizer was delicious; it was sitting in kale pesto and nuts which I wanted to dump directly into my mouth. I tried one of the pasta dishes for my entree. The serving size was good as I could not finish it, and it was served with two slices of grilled bread. They even brought another plate of complimentary bread as requested as my pasta had burrata which was good on the bread. The service was a little off, like our server was not very experienced or was fairly new to this restaurant. The overall concept is cool with the main restaurant, bar, and beer garden. I wish they had more happy hour offerings, but I plan on returning one weekend and giving brunch a try. The food is fresh, and you can tell some thought went into the menu.",

    "text": "I rate my experience 3 stars. Our server, Eli, was amazing and deserves 2 stars all on his own. And 1 star for the design and ambiance (before the sun went down).   We came in the late afternoon and sat outside. Unfortunately, there wasn't any shade coverage for our large party at the picnic tables- in AZ, that is crucial, even in February. I'm sure they're working on it. Even still, it was a nice afternoon. Once the sun went down, we could barely see a thing without any lights or candles at the table. Again, they're probably working on it... hopefully.   The food was good, but I feel like its wasn't as good as it should have been for the prices. The drinks, however, were worth every penny.  Even with uncomfortable accommodations, a dining experience can be rescued by the quality of service given. Eli was a knight in shining armor to quickly, accurately, and warmly help our large party. We had 16 people in our party and he managed to keep our orders straight upon delivery and splitting checks. We saw his hustle to make sure we got our food and drinks in a timely manner. The other staff helping to deliver food were friendly, but Eli was our guy! Unfortunately, Eli had the unnecessary and unfair responsibility for making up for the rude, condescending and unprofessional interaction we had with the manager, Steve. I am dumbfounded that he is the manager with that poor showing of service. I myself am a manager in the customer service industry, and have worked many years in the food industry, so I know there are stresses to be had when running a service business. But, his behavior was appalling. If management is to be the influence and example of how customers are treated, I can see why there are reviews of slow/poor service. I really hope he doesn't talk to his staff the way he talked to us. To Eli: you were amazing and I would go back to Ocotillo if you were my server again!",

    "text": "I've been here twice - first time for a lovely brunch with my parents. I got the breakfast chimichanga and was not disappointed. My parents both enjoyed their dishes. Parking is excellent and the ambience is quite nice.  The second time was for a group birthday party I arranged for a friend. I called numerous days ahead to reserve an outside area for 14 people. The hostess was a delight and our reservation was set. Also prior to our arrival, we called to see if we could keep an ice-cream cake we ordered for the birthday girl in the freezer while we were eating to bring out for a surprise to her. Erin, who we talked to, was extremely accommodating and we were looking forward to being able to surprise our girl with her most favorite cake. When the guests arrived, the hostess was expecting us and led us right to the area I sought out as a lovely place to dine and drink on a Saturday afternoon. Eli was our rad and hilarious server, he was so patient while each of us ordered different drinks, pitchers of sangrias, small plates and then later when all 14 of us ordered our meals. He kept our bill organized and straight - it was quite impressive! The most unfortunate moment of the night, and why I give this 3 stars, was when we encountered the manager.  This guy who seemed very much in charge so thus we assumed was the manager but we wouldn't have known since he didn't even introduce himself approached our table. What we thought was going to be a normal \"how's your food/experience?\" was anything but that. He started off by pointing out the very clearly gifted unopened bottle of wine for the birthday girl at the end of the table surrounded by birthday cards as a concern that we might actually open the bottle of wine and drink it then and there. There was no intention to open the gifted bottle of wine and he didn't even ask if we were planning to open it. We clarified the wine was a gift, we wouldn't open it and we had other cocktails we were happily enjoying. The other moment where we felt like children was when he said we shouldn't have brought in a cake, since cakes were for special events only and he would have preferred we ordered off the dessert menu. It was confusing that we weren't considered \"a special event\" when we were there for a large party of 14, had reserved our area for this said event and even got the \"okay\" to bring in the cake. Getting on the defense from the cake reprimand, we volunteered that we had received an okay by calling prior to our arrival to bring our own ice-cream cake and that it was okay to be stored in the freezer. This was quite a shock to him, but clearly it would be a shock since he asked zero questions and assumed our behavior would be as he thought. He scampered off after we gave the delightful woman's name who okayed our cake. He ruined the surprise of the special ice-cream cake for our birthday girl. We asked later who this man was and yes, it was the manager and yes his name is Steve.   Food and drinks were delicious, Eli - our server was very well informed and awesome, the hostess was friendly, Erin who helped us set up our party was extremely accommodating, unfortunately Steve the manager put a damper on our night and ruined our buzz.",

I ordered the brisket sandwich. I ate maybe a quarter of the massive slab of meat on the open bread. I left the rest because the remaining meat was pure fat. I expect some fat on brisket but not nearly the entire sandwich. Fortunately some yummy fries were included so I didn't go hungry.  My group also ordered the roasted cauliflower for a starter. It was very good and wished I ordered that as my main meal instead.",

We dined mid-week at lunch and shared 3 different options: Gem Lettuce salad (yum), Mesquite Brisket sandwich (double yum), and Ocotillo Chicken (5 yums). This is Cuisine, not just food. I would recommend going on a nice day when you can sit outside or go with someone you don't want to have to talk to! The server did tell us they are measuring for carpeting and will be installing drapes or other furnishings to absorb noise, so lots of people must've complained.",

The brussel sprout/kale salad is a favorite, I have to get it every time.  I keep telling myself to try a different salad, but I LOVE this one and even find myself craving it.  The falafel burger is another favorite and of course the ribs!  The wine and cocktail selections are extensive, something for everyone.  Brunch is very busy on weekends so go at an off time, maybe 1 or 2pm to void the crowds.  Ocotillo has become one of our go-to favorites, and it's a great place to bring out of town guests!",

My husband ordered the sausage sandwich and a beer and I had the mussels and iced tea. The food was great, and I like to think of myself as a connoisseur of mussels. These were cooked perfectly - obviously done, but tender and not a second over-cooked. The broth was amazing - shallots, tomatoes, garlic, lime, cilantro, and red pepper flakes. The two crostini served with the mussels and broth were grilled jut right. My husband really enjoyed his sandwich which was served with cole slaw on it and French fries on the side. I didn't have any fries, but they were thin cut and looked to be fried to perfection. The facility is beautiful - open, light, hip, spacious, with a beautiful outdoor area we can't wait to try when it cools down.  The best part? The service! The GM was extremely attentive, as was our server, Sarah. We will be back many times, and very soon!",

The menu was good, the food was seasoned well, and the service was good.

The reception staff were very accomodating allowing my wife and I to have a booth instead of a smaller table for two.  The restaurant is modern industrial, a bit noisy but is very comfortable.  There are tables for small and large parties, some community tables and a large outside dining area. We were inside, but next time we plan to dine outside. The staff was very attentive.  We were greeted almost immediately by our waiter then soon after another person that may have been a manager that offered help with wine and drinks.  The menu has many options with salads, appetizers, small and big plates, and also desert.  We decided on trying the roasted beets, crispy chicken meatballs, and a lamb ragu pasta.  We ordered the beets and chicken meatballs as starters, then shared the pasta afterwards.  These three dishes exceeded my high standards, high quality and large enough for two to share.  The menu seems slanted towards Asian but the menu is eclectic. There should be enough choices for all to be happy.  One of the staff that attended the table recommended the fish and chips whilch is one of the luncheon offerings.  They also have a brunch on the weekends, which looks interesting, different but still familiar. Plan to go back soon to try more of the menu.",

It was like a little urban oasis. The menu was delightful refreshing and healthy. Everything is beautifully presented  and I was truly impressed. I had met a girlfriend there for lunch and the only problem we had is that it is so busy and very very noisy. I had seen this as a problem and some of the other reviews and apparently a lot of it is due to the concrete flooring in the restaurant. Since I hadn't seen my girlfriend in quite a long time and we wanted to talk we thought maybe this was not the place for us and discussed this with our weight person Jamie. Jamie asked us to just wait a minute and she will talk with her manager who was so very nice and finding us a very quiet booth in the back of the restaurant so that we could girl chat.I was really impressed with this cause it was a very very busy lunchtime. Manager did share with me that they would be putting carpeting down because they realize that this was a problem. I think it will solve some of the noisiness.Will definitely go back again.",

The restaurant wasn't very crowded when we arrived around 11:30, and the hostess seated us on the patio at a table partially in the sun. I asked if it was possible to be moved to a shady table but the hostess responded saying there were 200 reservations that day and all tables were reserved. Another table was seated nearby soon after and the hostess offered to move them to a table in the shade, right after telling me we couldn't be. The waitress took 10 minutes to even say hello, and she had a bit of an attitude as we ordered our food and wanted to be sure that a dairy allergy was recognized for one of our meals. Luckily the food was excellent, but everything else made for an unpleasant experience. As we were leaving, I took note that only 2 other patio tables had been occupied during our brunch, which means we could have been moved to a shady table as I had originally requested. Unfortunately we will not be visiting Ocotillo again due to our experience, and I will not recommend to friends and family, as I cannot insure that their experience will be better than mine.",

Also, ordered the 2 eggs breakfast which was to include apple wood bacon.  The bacon was so thin and shriveled like something you would get at a fast food drive thru.

Don't tell customers how awesome your version of the same meal was AFTER you just had a horrible tasting meal.",

Couldn't order off dinner menu til 530 and server took another tables order before ours even though they were seated after us.  That's why only 4 stars.  The pairings on the plates were very tasty!!!!  Too full for dinner :-(",

The restaurant was a friends choice and upon walking in, we were all so excited with the selection and couldn't wait to see the rest of the space ect... Sat at one table, ordered a few drinks and quickly moved to another table to accommodate our group--- DOWNHILL from there! The poor waitress was completely overwhelmed and dropped the ball right from the start. Ordered drinks, then some apps,  and 30+ min later drinks hadn't arrived! Servers placed the few plates that came out at uneven times at the end of the table and we had to get up and give one another our food, still no drinks mind you. 6 people ordered the whole fish and 15 min she came back to let us know it had run out 2 hrs earlier. Then an hour and half into our experience, she remembered to ask the rest of the table for our order! We asked for more help for the table and the additional hands were accompanied by an abrasive manager who made us feel like we were the ones inconveniencing the server by moving our seats around?? Which we never did! Oh the drinks had yet to arrive! Final straw--- I ask the poor server where my meal was and she stops, stares, and replies that she forgot to place the order and the kitchen was now closed-- then cries.  It was terrible, No cheese requests can with cheese, more wine came as a beer, and then no dinner for me and my sister. I finally got up and spoke to the manager, David Johnson, who proceeded to unprofessionally told me that the waitress would loose her job(completely inappropriate and unprofessional of him to say) and that he would do what managers do to fix our bill.   He pick and chose what to take off, which was so lame, as we were never there for a free ride, just extremely disappointed by everything operational having to do with this place. One server brought us, a table of 20, two complimentary jars of dessert. I feel really bad that something with so much potential and great food wouldn't thrive due to their poor poor management.",

If you are looking for a place to meet up with some friends and have a few drinks, then this is definitely the place to go. But, the food is just so so and the service is spotty. On my first visit we just had drinks, which were great, but the service was pretty bad ( had to find someone for water, another drink, to pay, etc). On my second visit service was great but the food was so so. I liked the fried zucchini. My husband had the ribeye and it wasn't just really fatty, it was kind of grisly. I had the Asian chicken dumpling soup- they aren't actually dumplings, more like chicken meatballs. That's fine, but the broth was way too sweet. It was missing that umami taste that a good hot pot has.  Anyway, I really really want to put this place on my go to list because it's got such a great vibe. But, I can't justify paying $120 plus for drinks and so so food.",

Eco friendly, filled with love and warmth. An extremely welcoming atmosphere. They may have had some growing pains when they were the new kid on the block with the hosts but that is all behind us. From the moment you enter this fabulous space to the moment you leave, one feels the warmth. The food has always been phenomenal. We have been there for brunch, coffee at the cafe, beer at the beer gardens, happy hour at the bar, lunch on a weekday, dinner on a weekend. Every meal has been an explosion of carefully balanced flavors. My husband makes pasta at home from scratch and he says their fresh pasta is better than his. That is huge coming from him. The fresh herbs and spices are so creatively and beautifully married together with the main ingredient... The wine list is AMAZING... And oh so so reasonable! Dave is an excellent sommelier/owner.... We take all of our foodie friends to this fabulous space and our out of town guests.... Seriously, whether you are a local or a visitor, this is a NOT TO MISS adventure that your palate will thank you for. Its creative but yet approachable... No I do not have any affiliation to this magnificent place, just a local that LOVES this place and wants to see it succeed because of the love that has gone into creating this place!!!!",

I had to go to the car to get ear plugs so I could stand sitting in there to finish my meal.  They need to rethink the seating in that main room.

Additional coffee bar venue stocked with White Russian Coffee Stouts? Also here.   Though I would not be a self-proclaimed hipster, I thoroughly enjoyed my brunch experience here at Ocotillo. Our server was friendly and patient with our large group of people. My dish was hearty and flavorful -- I had the smoked brisket with polenta, which was recommended by our waiter. It was a great combination of textures (creamy polenta with crispy onion strings and tender meat); however, it was a lot saucier than I imagined, almost like a soup. I also snagged a bite of the Breakfast Burger which was huge and also very well-prepared.   Overall, I enjoyed the tree-lined walkways and cool brunch patio. I also appreciate that they take reservations here!! Our large party and I left happy and full.  On my second visit: I brought my puppy, and enjoyed a nice lunch out on the patio. Ocotillo was very welcoming to him, and had water bowls prepared for their four-legged guests.",

We were informed by the waiter this previously happened around two weeks ago and the power wasn't restored until 12am. He continued to he would have to write up the bill by hand which took approximately 1 hour. So we had to sit and wait in the dark with no a/c. During that time none of the staff offered us anything to try and make the situation any better, but they did walk right pass our group and offered two other tables complimentary champagne. The acting manager said she would comp our drinks, but when we got the bill they were all on there. One of our group contacted the owner who provided us all with a contact person to get a refund. When we tried contacting her the next day she said it wasn't their fault the power went off and they wouldn't issue any refunds. No one was blaming them for the blackout just the lack of customer service after and being told different things by staff. But they didn't forget the calculate the gratuity while we sat in the dark for 1 hour. When the owner was contacted after the staff person he sent us to for a refund refused to give us a one he asks for our addresses so he can mail us gift cards. 1. I wouldn't go back after the horrible customer service. 2. If you read the response to one of our groups review you would you want him to have your address?",

    "text": "Dined here with a large group the other night. Everything was going well until the power went out. That's when they had an opportunity to show strength in customer service and failed horribly. We sat around for a good 45 minutes at least waiting for them to figure out our bills via a manual calculator, pen and scratch paper. We were all well aware it was not their fault for the power outage however it was beyond any of our understandings how not one person of the managerial staff could approach our table, acknowledge the power outage, apologize for the inconvenience, and have a simple back-and-forth about how to make things right so that everyone can walk away happy. Instead they dropped some candles at our table while looking very stressed and disorganized and ran circles around the problem rather than addressing it head on. I won't be returning here simply because in a moment like this an establishment can easily rise to the occasion with a laid back group such as ours. I'd rather not dine out at a place where I know from experience that the staff can't handle a small crisis. Not to mention this was the second power outage they had recently experienced, so they apparently hadn't learned anything from the first one. We were told our drinks would be comped by one person and then received our bills with said drinks calculated in. We were also told after the fact (the next day) we would be able to receive a refund by contacting Avia Lopez and she ended up being more of a headache by being completely rude on the phone and refusing to provide any sort of refund. David Johnson the general manager was at first helpful but then went back on the things that he had said regarding wanting to make things right for us and offered to mail out some gift cards. Pretty sure at this point those would have never been received somehow. Thanks but no thanks I'll take my business elsewhere.",

This restaurant was our place of choice to have Mother's Day brunch today. I have eaten here several times before and like always it did not disappoint! I got the Avocado Toast with Smoked Salmon and the Cauliflower which were both amazing and flavorful but still light. Everyone in our party got something different so it was fun to sample everyone's food (everything was fantastic). Only bad comment on our trip today, the mimosa glasses the server brought out were dirty, and the glasses they brought out the juice in for the mimosas (which you are supposed to pour yourself) in cups that were very inefficient in terms of pouring and would have caused us to spill juice all over the table. Both problems were resolved when brought to the servers attention though he did seem a bit defensive about the juice containers at first. Overall a great dining experience, I will definitely be back very soon!",

Located conveniently in Central Phoenix this place is an oasis in the city with great food and plenty of outdoor area with lush greenery and in modern setting.  We went here for lunch for my boss' going away party and sat inside.  The service and food were excellent.  They have beautiful artwork and pictures from local artists which really makes for an enjoying atmosphere.  The outdoor space is amazing and I wish we sat outside because this is the perfect time of year to enjoy the beautiful AZ weather.    I had the Korean BBQ Brisket sandwich and side of fries which was amazing. There are a lot of unique dishes which will keep me coming back for more.  They even make their own pasta noodle and have a pastry chef for the desserts!  A must try if you are in the area!",

The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful, inside and out. It seems like it might be best to just go for drinks when the weather permits outdoor leisure.   Our server wore a dirty, backwards MLB baseball cap and looked/acted more like a cook or busser than a server. (If you've ever worked in the food industry, you know what I mean.) We ordered appetizers, and those were decent and timely. Our food took a while, but it was the busy lunch hour so not too odd. What really bummed us out was how terrible the entrees were.   My salad came without any dressing and with tomatoes (which I was super specific about because I'm allergic.)  They took my salad and brought it back out still without dressing, and I could tell the'd just picked the tomatoes out as there were left behind juices and tomato seeds. Furthermore, it came without ingredients it said were in it on the menu which made for a super bland, dressingless salad... Then I found a legitimate leaf from a garden weed; furry, spiky and all. Yuck! I wish I could say my dish were the exception, but...   One coworker had an overcooked salmon with a side a mushy, bland, lukewarm greens and another a salad overrun with onions. One ordered the smoked brisket sandwich and was pulling out huge chunks of fat. From the half of the sandwich she choked down, over half of the brisket was fat sitting on her plate. Our birthday-guy ordered the brussel sprout chicken salad, and that thing even looked gross! The chicken looked and tasted like it was boiled and several days old, and the brussel sprouts were so bitter and hard. They must have been at least a week old. It was absolutely covered in cheese too, I assume to disguise the rubbery, pale-gray colored strips of chicken on top.  Only one of us enjoyed our meal, and that was our carnivorous, garbage disposal coworker. For sure, will not be going back and will tell others to steer-clear. Definitely wish I would have taken pictures, but we already felt awkward sitting without eating and leaving plate fulls of food without asking for to-go boxes.   Our server could obviously tell we didn't like the food, and made a point to ask which we were honest about but didn't make a fuss. Didn't ask for a discount or manager or anything, just super bummed it was such poor quality, bland and just over-all bad food.   Not super important, but we didn't even get offered a dessert menu even though we made a point of telling our server it was a coworker's birthday.   Maybe we just came on a bad day, seeing that the reviews are generally positive, but that comes out to a very expensive bad day...",

I was intrigued by the menu and decided to give it a go. From the very beginning the staff was welcoming and warm. Dave the General Manager was so nice, engaging all the customers at the bar in conversation, really made me feel like I was setting down for a meal in his home. The bartender serving me (I unfortunately didn't get his name) was very cheery and engaged, made great suggestions and was great at anticipating my needs especially when my mouth was full of ribs and my fingers full of sauce! The smoked beets were fresh, cooked just right and chilled to perfection for the hot day. I went for the ribs for the main course which were amazing. Super tender with just enough char to give them an amazing flavor when paired with the mole bbq sauce. I will definitely be back and I will definitely be bringing some friends!",

    "text": "After a duo of experiences here, once for dinner, once for brunch, I can safely exclaim and about to the mountain tops that I'm a fan now.  Yesterday, my group of 9 was well taken care of and attended to by our waiter, Michael K! Despite us hogging the table long after we were done and some being indecisive in the beginning, he handled us like a champ! He was so nice and always asking if we needed anything and if everything was to our liking.  The food was great as expected! I went a bit lighter on my entree choice, the avocado toast. The bread was Noble Bread, which I absolutely love! I also asked for that salmon topping to add some protein in there. The salmon was so tender and not crusted over like some other smoked salmon tends to be so I was sooo happy. The only thing my hubby complained about (mind you, he was stealing food off my plate!) was that he thought it was a bit too citrusy. I didn't mind it so much because I like lemon squeezed on my seafood anyway, so to each their own.  His brisket on polenta was a real treat. To be even, I stole half his polenta and 1/3 of his brisket to make sure I got all of my protein since he ate some of my dish. It was indeed also tender but that's how the short ribs were when I had dinner here.   I also ordered the bread pudding doughnut with chocolate and sprinkles, because I needed something sweet to balance the savory. It came in a skillet and topped with ice cream just like a pizookie is served but it was even better. I was nice and shared a few bites with other friends but it was definitely rich and not so healthy! They were upset that I tempted them with such wonderful heavenly sweetness!   All this food paired with mimosas and a Bloody Mary! I couldn't ask for a better Sunday morning... well along with the team USA winning women's FIFA World Cup before we got to brunch.",

Honestly, it bums me out. So let me tell you what we got:   Fried chicken sandwich, comes with side of fries Cauliflower OG Roasted Brussels sprouts Eggplant meatballs Shoestring french fries with Parmesan Crispy hashbrown cake Ahi bowl Tagliatelle pasta and shrimp in red sauce Linguini with toasted garlic   We also got most of the signature cocktails.  The dudes refilling our waters were on top of their job. They were great. Our server was sweet.   The only things I would recommend are the Eggplant Meatballs, the ahi bowl, and the Cauliflower OG (the green sauce really set it apart). I didn't mind the Along Came a Hummingbird drink, but several of the others were a very weird mix of flavors that didn't particularly mesh that well together (one was a moonshine drink, another had elderflower something in it - sorry, I really should have taken a photo of their new menu).   Overall, I wouldn't return.",

The second time I ordered the \"Smoked Beets\" which had herb Ricotta, Baby Arugula, local pecans, Arizona honey, and bee pollen for around $9. The herb Ricotta went very well with the honey and pecans. However, the beets did not taste smoked at all, they just tasted like regular boiled beets.  The place itself however is very beautiful!

    "text": "We had an amazing lunch here on a Saturday around 1. It was busy but not too crowded; we got a table no problem even without a reservation. Ocotillo is a large space.. walking in from the parking lot you pass two outdoor bars on the right and left before entering the main building. Lots of space to hang out and have a drink outside. Once inside they have an indoor dining room, bar area, and another patio off of the dining room.   On weekends they serve the brunch menu but it still has a nice variety of sweet/breakfast items, lighter plates, salads and some more \"lunch\" items. We sat inside since it was drizzling a little bit outdoors but I would recommend checking out the outdoor space if you can.   Our server was super nice, on top of coffee and water refills and quick. We tried the brunch burger (my girlfriend asked for it plain and with regular fries instead of hot fries- they were great with the changes), the ahi tuna and the gem lettuce salad.   The burger was super tasty and the fries were as well. My girlfriend said it's been one of the better \"restaurant\" burgers she has had. She usually doesn't eat the entire burger and fries when we go out but she finished this plate!  The ahi tuna was soooo good. Sometimes I am skeptical ordering ahi plates because some restaurants seem to just have them because it's \"in\" now and they aren't very great. But I look a gamble with this one and it sure paid off. The tuna is on a bed of cucumbers and forbidden rice which adds a nice crunch. Avocado on top with a sesame vinaigrette, it was to die for. Perfect for lunch.   The gem lettuce salad also had a mix of carrots, radish, cucumber, onion, crispy brown rice, basil and this awesome ginger-peanut dressing. My dad was a fan and let me try some, even I enjoyed it and I'm not a huge salad person.   The only semi-downside was it was pretty loud inside, however this is a place where many groups gather for brunch or celebrations so I would just come prepared. Beyond that we had no complaints... I will certainly be returning to check out their dinner menu or when I am in the mood for brunch!",

We shared a delicious vegetable plate, followed by salad, cheesesteak, and chicken shawarma. The sweet potato was scrumptious and we loved the sauces that came with our dishes.

    "text": "First off, our server Kyle rocked: he fielded all of our menu questions with grace & info. A family of foodies, we like to know the intimate details of every little ingredient. Yes, we ask things like \"is this beet salad the same one you used to have?\" \"are the eggplant meatballs vegetarian?\" etc. etc. etc.  Ocotillo delivers on flavor, variety of options for gluten free, pescatarians, vegetarians, y mas. They also serve generous portions. And did I mention the gorgeous indoor/outdoor setting and seating?   We ordered different dishes from different categories & shared.   SMALL PLATE: Ahi Tuna -- I don't eat sushi any more but my brother & sister-in-law raved about this dish. The presentation awed us with avocado slices fanned out on the plate, contrasting with pink Ahi, black rice, pale green cucumber, doused with a sesame-yuri vinaigrette. Asian flair galore...  VEGETABLES: Beet Salad - melange of flavors was like a party in my mouth. I gobbled this up & no one else got to eat much! Love love love the beets, mixing w/ savory herbed ricotta, and drizzle of honey  + crunch of pollen. All on a massive bed of arugula... (Yes-This does taste like their former beet salad :) Eggplant \"Meatballs\" -- surprisingly scrumptious! They incorporate eggplant with something like falafel mix/bread crumbs to bind them, laid on a bed of creamy polenta, surrounded by a moat of pesto. We couldn't get enough of...   SALADS: Carrot Fattoush -- a colorful blend of lettuces, radishes, mint, seeds and the most delectable CARROT hummus we've ever tasted (actually I've never had ANY carrot hummus before), dressed with Meyer Lemon vinaigrette. Pieces of khubz (flat unleavened pita-type bread) decorate the salad, adding a nice crunch, like flat croutons. Mmmm Mmmm good...  SANDWICHES: Salmon sandwich - luscious piece of salmon on a hefty ciabatta roll, laced with avocado, tomato, arugula and a light lemon vinaigrette. Can't go wrong with this standard favorite.   Ocotillo is always a good choice: impress out-of-towners, organize an impromptu girls' lunch, or celebrate a special occasion, like Wednesday!",

Hubby and I were in town for a long weekend, him for tactical combat training and I... lounging with friends in pjs all day long.   We had a red eye flight back to DC and had made plans to get together with hubs childhood friend and pastor before heading to the airport.   Phoenix was also an annual trip visiting friends when I lived in SD but never really ventured out for the food scene. This time, didn't  want to miss an opportunity to check what's cooking in the city. So I scoured yelp all morning deciding which hip place to enjoy quality food with quality people.   Well, I must say the whole experience was a hit.   - Parking at the back was limited but a couple was pulling out of their spot as soon as we pulled in, SCORE!!! There's also plenty of street parking available.  - Grounds and ambience was incredible... from the walk way lined with lit trees to picnic tables, lounge areas with fire pits, open kitchen and bars galore. This whole establishment probably spans the entire block of 3rd st and flower. I felt like I was in a swanky park having a picnic.  - Food was outstanding. We ordered roasted beets,  Mesquite chicken, falafel and Rueben sandwich. I was not hungry so I went for the beets and they were incredible. Roasting the roots made it even sweeter. The chicken was crispy on the outside and very tender and moist inside.  - Staff was extremely busy but very polite, friendly and prompt with our orders.   We were seated next to the open kitchen on a high table. It was loud from the bar next to us and craziness in the kitchen which woke my sleeping 10 month old the minute we sat down but she loved watching people and walking about on the table. So if you have little ones this may not the place to take them... well, at least not as late as 9pm.   I can't wait to be back.",

Food which we tried so many different things and EVERYTHING was delicious. So many options to choose from as well, which is hard when its on a menu and you have to choose one.

While being seated indoors for a fairly large party, the area was clean, modern and attractive. Probably one of my favorites. Josh helped recommend wine before we ordered and also helped us choose our plates as well. We ordered the pasta with chicken ragu, a filet minion served in a charcuterie board, two orders of beef ribs, a chicken dish, wings, and a squash soup. That sounds like a lot but we all finished it cause we don't play. Every plate had such a unique flavor that we all enjoyed. I'll definitely be coming back here and aiming during the day time for brunch menu! Josh was an amazing server.  As I returned for a second time with a large party Katia(?) gave us exceptional service and was pleased to have her! The beef bones are always a must have when going here. I also appreciate the birthday dessert complimentary to our party and a lot of first timers that I brought loved this place. Definitely a Phoenix Staple.",

I was mesmerized by the walk from the parking lot to the restaurant with all the beautiful bloomed trees! Since we had a dog in our party, we sat outside at one of the tables in the covered patio and were brought waters right away. I ordered a Moscow mule and the crispy hash brown cake from the HH menu. The drink was just a standard Moscow mule, delicious and refreshing, but not anything special.  The crispy hash brown cake came with smoked brisket and a fried egg on top. It was delicious. The brisket was so tender that I didn't even need a knife! The egg broke and was perfectly runny. The runny yolk made the sauce even more decadent. I used the hash brown cake to soak up all the gravy. I will have to come back to try the brunch at some point! Definitely do yourself a favor and try this restaurant out! The food is absolutely worth it!!",

I thought for sure there was going to be a long  wait but we were surprisingly seated immediately with options for inside and out.  The ambiance here is where this place really shines in my opinion. It has a modern interior with an industrial looking exterior. The outside area is really cozy with fire pits, heaters, and mood lighting.   After a recommendation from the waiter I got the Wood fired beef ribs, and my friend got the mesquite grilled chicken. I was shocked at how big the portions were. It says \"large\" on the menu category but I wasn't expecting so many huge delicious ribs and a giant chicken leg quarter. The food was very tasty, albeit a bit on the pricier side.  All in all this place has a great atmosphere with some really nice food and cocktail options. I can see why this place is so popular. Can see myself coming back again!",

We arrived with our novels, ready to order coffee drinks and nest while construction was occurring on our home.   The service on a Saturday morning around 10:30 at the coffee bar was deplorable.  We were literally abandoned by our server.  We had to continually request milk, a top for cup etc.  We were not impressed.   Upon realizing that it was too chilly to sit outside we went inside to the restaurant.  Although we were not yet ready for lunch we thought we could find some brunch items which would allow us to be inside.   The first two items I selected could not be adapted for my food allergies because the items were 'pre-prepared'. After listing my food allergies the female Server started arguing with me. I suggested she not argue about my food allergies since she Knew nothing about this and was clearly Not listening based on her alternate suggestions.   she then stormed off.  We got up and left and won't be back. I recommend you go someplace else if you need any accommodations.",

It takes a lot to admit when you are wrong and I also understand how it is easy to become defensive when it comes to something you are passionate about. I wish them the best of luck moving forward.  ***Old Review*** Wow. I had to change my review because now the manager, Walter S. had the audacity to \"compliment me\" a message on Yelp cursing me out, saying I was ignorant and tried to insult me saying I must eat at \"Subway\" or \"Denny's\". People are entitled to their opinions. That's what Yelp is all about. I didn't even give that bad of a review. I made sure to point out all the positives and a said I would give it 3.5 stars. I have gotten bigger, better salads at many other restaurants, Olive & Ivy, Maizie's, FEZ... Just to name a few.  Walter, this is your wake up call. You can't afford to act like this. All the people who work at the restaurant and who have invested time and money into that place rely on it's success, and it cannot afford to fall because of a prideful man who cannot take criticism.",

The bar does an excellent job preparing very full and delicious drinks as well as pairing a careful selection of wines to the dishes (ask for Dave for a special sommelier service).

That's what my taste buds said the moment I put this deliciousness in my mouth. Actually, even before that taste my eyes were like - oh yeah!  You get two pieces of chicken with skin on the bone and underneath is this revelation of a potato salad. The overall flavors are sweet and spicy due to the honey and chili's. The juice from the chicken kicks up the potato salad flavor even more. Game changer. I have to admit that I find the atmosphere a tiny bit pretentious so I haven't loved my dining in experiences despite the lovely decor, but I won't hesitate to order out this chicken regularly. That way I can also dive in with my hands like this chicken demands :-). The bartender who took care of the to-go's was super nice and welcoming, thank you!",

The space is courtyard style so you feel totally encapsulated and are surrounded by desert landscaping, concrete, rust and wood. Part coffee stand, part restaurant, part outdoor lounge.  The sheep's milk ricotta small plate was SO GOOD. Sun dried strawberries? What? Plus our server was nice and gave us an extra basket of that grilled bread.   We also got the fried zucchini, simply because it came with burrata and my sister and I are addicts. Thankfully it was good here (I am ever amazed at the poor quality of burrata out there).  We drank craft beer and sat in the sunshine and ate good food. Man, I miss AZ. Thank you Ocotillo, from the bottom of my heart, for this lovely lunch on my last day in Phoenix.",

They didn't even have copper ups for them  and at an \"establishment\" like this there isn't an excuse. We spent almost $400 for four people to eat and we ordered steaks  and one person had the ribs. I don't eat carbs yet they would not allow me to substitute the starch for a veggie. The cook staff looked rough and were kids, and had neck tattoos and the wait staff were shooting air dart guns to kill flies or other things off tables. There was no shortage of staff and no patrons when we went and yet the mirrors at the bars were totally funky and nasty and the bathrooms had hair on the sinks, other funk and felt like a gas station bathroom. The best thing we ate were the salads. Very good but all the food is heaping portions. I expected a little more refined class at this place so I was disappointed in the Applebees experience. Too bad I didn't Applebees prices. Maybe they rock the brunch out, I don't know...but for the price, this place offers nothing special. We had two birthdays that were on the reservation and they didn't even bring out the complimentary dessert that most places would have. However, with the huge portions it wasn't needed but just goes to the class of the joint. None.",

A pretty unique rendition but flavour was light and fluffy.  They also have buckwheat pancakes that makes this place a bit unique.  The brisket was cooked perfectly and very tender.  The location was hip with nice indoor and outdoor seating but extremely loud inside due to poor acoustic design that so many of these \"industrial\" designs suffer from.  Overall a positive experience.  Expect brunch weekends to be packed and loud.  Lots of the seating is communal as well if that matter to you.",

They have inside and outside brunch and dinner plus a coffee bar, bier garten  and a lot of cool outside space with bistro lights and a fireplace for those cool evenings to sit and chill with your friends or loved one..best part of all..they are fur baby friendly!! The service was a little slow especially with coffee refills but the food was presented well and tasted excellent! The price was more than your standard diner but appropriate for more high end brunch, service and ambience.",

Within 2-5 minutes of being seated, our server was prompt and pleasant. Even more, when we asked about menu suggestions I appreciated his knowledge base. Often when going to eateries, not many servers can vouch for their product...disturbing to say the least! But, not at Ocotillo!  The server recommended this amazing Korean BBQ Sandwich and my goodness, it was delish! We were eating within 15 minutes of order, likely sooner. Aside from good eats, it's all about the vibe. Another 10/10 for Ocotillo with good music, great space, and amazing people. I seriously don't know where they have room for improvement at this point. Maybe just teach other eateries how to be that amazing!",

They had a DJ so it was good music at least.   They also have a dog friendly patio and a little grass area the kids can play on.

I love the open concept and all the outdoor seating they have available.  I wasn't super impressed with the food. The meal started out great when we started with the watermelon mango salad. Probably one of the best salads I've ever had. Very fresh and light with a whole bunch of flavor. There's some sort of spice that they put on it that adds a great unexpected kick.  I ordered the ocotillo chicken, my mom ordered the pork flautas, and a friend ordered the pork shoulder sand which. All of the meals came and the presentation was great. However the food looks a lot better than it tastes. I actually had to ask for something else because my chicken was sickly sweet, and I'm a sweets person. I was not a fan of the taste whatsoever. They replaced it happily with the pasta dish with the pork meatballs. That dish was much better, the meatballs were very flavorful and paired well with the pasta. I tried both of my companions meals and wasn't too impressed with their meals either.  Looked the look and feel of the place but the food left a lot to be desired.",

The presentation of the food is gorgeous, and the taste is to match! Such a fulfilling and wholesome taste. Instead of filling the plate with 3789 things they concentrate on bringing out the full flavor of the intended main item. Now, my husband and I don't typically go to these types of 'pretentious' places...to the point where we didn't know what to do when the bartender came over and laid down our napkins...and sat there with them on our laps for a good 5 minutes before realizing other patrons were using them as place mats...SMH. But, if you're looking to be fancy for a night then this is a great spot to pretend you know what you're doing! We sat inside at the bar, but it looks like the outdoor patio is a bit more lax. With the open kitchen I felt like I was in a Manhattan restaurant. Also, who knew Pimm's cup was so delicious? We couldn't say no to the refills! We will be visiting again for brunch, lunch, and dinner! Looking forward to experiencing the other areas of the multi-structured compound.",

How I didn't notice this place going up is beyond me as I drive by many times a week, but I didn't. This place is HUGE, like a compound almost. They have a huge yard/patio, the restaurant with a bar, a separate bar, and a separate coffee bar. The buildings were mostly made of old shipping containers, which was super neat. I went with a meetup group and the restaurant was very accommodating for our (very) large party.   For food, I had the brioche with red eye gravy and bacon and also got to try the cast iron pancake and the breakfast chimichanga. Out of all I tried, I felt like my brioche was the best item. The  bread itself was sweet and played well with the savory gravy, crispy bacon, perfectly sauteed greens, and runny egg. The pancake was giant and tasty, topped with fruit compote. The chimi was also a large portion, that looked perfectly crispy. Unfortunately, I think they preroll these things because they can't change the contents of the burrito, but the flavor was decent. This was probably my least favorite of the three. Needless to say, I will definitely return to this restaurant for brunch, booze, and other meals!",

I was fortunate to try this place for brunch with a few friends who wanted to split everything, so we basically sampled half the brunch menu. It was all outstanding. I highly recommend the cinnamon roll, but was so happily surprised by the crab mac and cheese (yes, for brunch) and the duck confit. Plus the staff kept the mimosas coming and were so gracious! A few weeks later I went back with coworkers for a weekday lunch, and though the menu was different it was all great again.

It was very, very smokey (ie not edible and verified by my dinner guest, we both found it inedible). I clearly didn't eat it but the server didn't seem to be bothered to ask much or see if something was wrong or if I wanted something else- just asked if I wanted a to go box. I told her it was way too smokey to eat and that was that. I am not one to send things back but I was still slightly disappointed by the lack of observation/concern on the behalf of the waitress.   Truly though, the food is great and had that one instance not occurred, they would be 5 star all the way for me. I also acknowledge I shouldn't be disappointed when not voicing to send it back specifically... I just find that to be painfully awkward so waitresses that are attentive to their customers are superstars in my book. Their Applejack/Cava cocktail is worth skipping dinner all together and ordering another if the budget is tight.... but that's just my style ;)",

    "text": "My wife and I have been to Ocotillo a few times and each time there's been something slightly negative that chips away at our experience. In all fairness, we have enjoyed the food but the service and the atmosphere has continued to free fall off of a cliff. Whether it's the restaurant's lackluster service, or being seated at a table where the afternoon sun will burn your retinas when there's an available shaded table in the same section or the awful acoustics while trying to have a relaxing dinner - there's always something off. This evening was no exception. Tonight, we were treated (for the last time, most likely) to a swarm of flies during our entire dinner; some crawling on the wall behind us, a few hovering over our food, a few brave ones daring enough to land on our table and one pesky guy hanging out on the cushion next to us while we ate waiting for a crumb to drop. It was so bad that one of the servers was stalking the restaurant with a fly zapping gadget that resembled a small tennis racket that made an annoying buzzing sound every time he smashed it against the window to kill a fly (which, most of the time, he was unsuccessful in). It was bad enough to have the flies zooming around our head, in and out of our entrees but to also have to see (and hear them) being killed while we ate was utterly disgusting.   Astonishingly, when we brought this to the attention of our waitress, she casually dismissed the reality of the situation without offering any kind of solution. It would have been one thing to address the problem and for the restaurant to offer some small token of apology or embarrassment over the situation or even a free dessert to go so we could enjoy it in our non-fly-infested home... anything!   But alas, the problem (as all problems at Octotillo in the past have been) was ignored. We actually left the bag of food they boxed up for us under the table (maybe it would attract the flies and everyone else would finally be able to enjoy their dinner!?) but the waitress followed us out of the restaurant to make sure we took it home with us (so we could put it in the garbage there).  PS - we've uploaded a few photos worth checking out.",

The service and cocktails were also fantastic, but the food was a miss for my group and I the night we went.   Our group ordered the Grilled Spanish Octopus, Peruvian Salmon Ceviche, Reginette Pasta, Wood Fired Beef Ribs, and Octoillo Chicken. The main issue we had as that almost every dish was burnt, especially the Octollio Chicken. Because of this the unanamous standout dish for the end was the Peruvian Salmon Ceviche. It was refreshing and most importantly not burnt. The ribs did fall off the bone but had a bitter burnt taste. For me the Reginette Pasta which had a lamb ragu sauce was too gamey for my liking and the bread was badly charred.  The chef and waitress were very accommodating and offered to remake the burnt dishes, so I definitely appreciate the excellent service. I took a risk and ordered an Octoillo Chicken to go and luckily it wasn't burnt and not overly sweet, which is why I would be willing to return to Ocotillo. If you are looking for outdoor space for an event or gathering, consider Ocotillo.  What I recommend: -- Peruvian Salmon Ceviche",

I tried my best to pair complimentary dishes with the grilled corn and halibut ceviche. The grilled corn came with 2 ears smothered in a spicy aioli, jalapenos, crispy coconut strips, and cilantro. Everything paired well together. My only complaint would be to serve the ears with \"holders\". It was a bit of a mess without them. The halibut ceviche was a major highlight! Fresh halibut, crispy quinoa, avocado, red onion, cilantro, and corn nuts. The freshness of the halibut with the overall texture profile knocked this dish out of the park. This would be perfect for a light meal or app. Ocotillo is worth your time, any night, for any reason.",

It's worth it to get here a little early to walk around and check it out. Stop by the coffee shop and grab some coffee. The two girls that run the coffee shop are so nice and helpful! My first time here, we ordered our food from the coffee bar and just found a seat at a picnic table instead of waiting for the dining area.  Our second time here, I brought my father for his birthday. He loved this place as much as I did. He stopped by the coffee shop and tried the mole mocha which has great chile chocolate flavor.   Things to order: If you order something that doesn't come with hash browns, do yourself a favor and order a side of them to share with the table! The blue corn pancakes, roasted cauliflower, chimichanga and breakfast burger are some of my favorites.   Both times we have been here with a group of people and we all tried each other's dishes. You really can't go wrong with anything you order. Good portions and great flavor!",

There's a buzz about the place though it comes off as a bit trendy. The service was good, not great. They seemed to be a bit understaffed. Our server took quite a bit of time between greeting, drinks, and our lunch order. I had the Asian style pork belly. It's listed as a savory dish yet it had a lot of sweet elements that really overpowered the savory. The pork belly was not prepared properly. The meat was very tough and exceedingly difficult to cut with a knife. Very tough and chewy. The exact opposite of what a nice, slow cooked pork belly should be.  It might be a nice place to meets friends for drinks and snacks, but watch your wallet. It seems Phoenix is attempting to compete with other major metropolitan cities by raising rents and food prices, yet with little to no added value.",

Using Yelp made it so easy where it shows the distance from our current location.  We chose Ocotillo after looking at the menu and reviews.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated both indoors and out.  The menu has a lot of yummy options.  All of us wanted to order with pasta with the brussels sprouts but did not have it available.  We chose another pasta dish that was excellent.  We were in a hurry to get back to the hospital and didn't have a chance to order anything else but looks at the other tables.  All the dishes looked yummy.  The only drawback are the flies.  We sat inside and the flies were constantly at our table.",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Ocotillo is excellent.  We've come for lunch and dinner and have been surprised at the consistent quality of the food.  For lunch we've ordered the house country pate (large portion, pretty good but nothing spectacular), roasted cauliflower, Peruvian chicken, and the mesquite grilled salmon (also average, but not bad at all.)  The cauliflower may be one of the single best dishes they serve.  Perfectly cooked, with some acidity and crunch on the side, it is fantastic.  The Peruvian chicken we had was also most and delicious.  Props to them for getting the aji amarillo right, comparing well to the best Peruvian we've had in LA and NYC.  Also came for dinner with some out-of-town guests.  We again ordered the cauliflower, and we ordered the beets (quite good, nothing to rave about, but good), grilled romano beans (perhaps the weakest dish we ordered but eh fiddleheads on the side were a GREAT touch), and the asparagus (well cooked, a little bite left, decently seasoned).  The three pastas we ordered were (in order of deliciousness):  casarecce, radiatore, and tagliatelle.  The Calabrian peppers added a nice kick to the heavy pork belly in the casarecce, which were al dente.  The radiotore was good, soft al dente, well-balanced and lighter than the other two.  The tagilatelle was over-cooked the flavors did not meld all that well on the plate.  The atmosphere here is great and with the above-average food, is worth visiting regularly.  Oddly I'll end on a negative.  The I am NOT a fan of the beer selection in the beer garden.  The area itself is great, but the selection is pretty poor and doe snot live up tot he beautiful surrounds.",

I was really impressed with the trendy ambience, fancy cocktails, and the diverse food options. Our dining experience was great until a guest in my business party tried to order ranch dressing. Jon, our waiter, joyously informed us that they didn't carry Ranch dressing because this is an \"American restaurant\". I informed him that ranch is, in fact, American. I asked if they had something equivalent. He unapologetically stated no, with a smug smile. I stated that he didn't have to look so happy about it. (hint hint, you don't have to be so rude). He reiterated that the restaurant didn't carry ranch, and that he appreciated that about working there.  The type of service that was provided by this gentleman did not fit the atmosphere of the restaurant. Fortunately for this restaurant, my experience will NOT keep me from coming back because the food and atmosphere was so wonderful, but I definitely would refuse service from this server/bartender in the future.",

Mine and my husbands food was good, but the salmon board ticked all of the boxes for flavor, portion size and presentation! If you haven't been here or driven by, this really is an interesting place. The outdoor seating is plentiful and shaded. The indoor seating is more limited. The entire restaurant is made from huge metal shipping crates, it's a really cute place.

I am sitting here with eight other people, including my husband. Our friends are in here from out of town, and we wanted to take them to a really nice and unique restaurant; and this definitely fits the bill. The food was incredible; and plentiful!! If you order from the Large Plates section...come with an appetite. They don't mess around with their large plate portions. They are perfect for sharing. I had the salmon and my husband had the ribeye; both fantastic!  For appetizer, we had this ricotta spread, with balsamic glaze and a sun-dried strawberries. Got to spread that on some toasted crostini; was so flavorful and a perfect way to start the dinner. We had a nice gentleman stop by our table shortly after we got there; making sure we were doing well. It wasn't until he came to our side of the table, that we realized he must have been the owner/manager. He helped us with our wine selection, and found us a great bottle of Chardonnay to go along with our meals. Dress code is \"casual\", technically...but all of us were in polos and nice jeans; and that seemed to be what other guests were wearing. So, business casual seemed more of an appropriate way to classify the dress code. We had a choice of inside and outside; and we chose outside. The evening cooled off quite a bit, but they had plenty of heaters to take off the chill. Where we were seated was perfect; quiet enough to hear and keep up with conversation...but still amongst other couples/diners. Plus...dining al fresco with your closest friends on a beautiful night...can't beat that! All in all, we highly recommend this place.",

I had to request the hostess to please wipe down the area before sitting down because they're were crumbs left behind. I waited for about 7 to 9 minutes before anyone came to my table. When the gentleman arrived he was only serving water and when I went to ask him a question he said \"I'm sorry I'm not your server I'm just serving water only\" before I can even ask my question. I just wanted to see if they had a Wi-Fi password but he had already walked away. I then had to stop another waitress who happened to be walking out to the patio in order for me to ask if there was a Wi-Fi password she said \"that she would check into it and come back shortly\" as she did not know. By this time it had been about 13 minutes before my waitress finally came to my table and introduced herself. I asked what her recommendations were and I was showing her pictures from Yelp and she had explained to me that their menu changes often so those pictures may not be the same as what's on the menu today. I was a bit disappointed at as I had already set my mind to a certain plate on the menu. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and instead of the fries I requested a hashcake.  The waitress seemed reluctant that the kitchen would be able to substitute the fries for the hash cake but surprisingly they were able to. The meal was delicious especially the hash cake, so I'm glad that they were able to accommodate me. And overall the atmosphere and food was great. We sat in the dining area inside. Although l loved the out door seating areas. I just didn't care for the service considering it was 1 p.m. and it was not busy at all, at least not in the area that we were sitting in. They're were about 4 tables besides ourselves being occupied. I did notice that they were dog friendly so that is why I gave them 3 stars. Next time I decide to come I'll definitely bring the pooch. I just hope that the service will be much better. I live out in the east valley which took about 35 minutes to get to Ocotillo.  I'm sure I passed over 50+ restaurants but I came here because it was recommended. But a customer should not have to wait that long to meet their waiter/waitress. It's  important to remember the value of customers because that's what keeps your doors open.",

By this time I'm over it and don't even order anything else. I decided to nibble on my friends hash browns that he ordered. It's an inch thick fried square. Tasted like morning, no flavor at all. I've literally had better food at Denny's  As far as the service, what service? The host informed us that our server would be right with us, he just had to run to the coffee bar \"real quick\" that real quick was 10 minutes later. The food runner doesn't talk. Literally, he doesn't talk. He dropped food off to me twice and didn't say a word. Not even to ask if I needed anything else. He just dropped the food and took off. My server didn't even come back to check to see how things were. I waited another 10 minutes and had to flag him down just to tell him my food was cold.

Excellent service, perfect beverage selection, and great food. We loved the smoked brisket, the chimichanga, the eggs & tortillas, the avocado toast, and the smoked beets. Wow - all so yummy. I loved that our waiter delivered a perfect beer-mosa for me, not everyone can do that just right. He never blinked an eye at our desire for split checks, even suggesting it from the start. I love that about a waiter and want to heap a better tip for his service. We ventured over to the coffee bar after for some chamomile tea and lattes - great service with friendly smiles and perfect beverages. I can't wait to come back!!!",

    "text": "This place...I cannot rave over it enough. Every time we come, I try something new and every time, I'm pleasantly surprised. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about what's in your meal or cocktail. They're genuinely kind too, which means something to me. The brunch menu is priced quite modestly for such a posh environment. Lunch and dinner are just a few dollars more.   Recently I had the Japanese style Fish-n-Chips which was listed under \"small\" dishes. It was actually three giant pieces of perfectly breaded cod sat atop crispy fries which had crushed nori sprinkled on them. The dish also came with a cucumber slaw. It was anything but \"small\" but I'm not complaining because it was damn delicious. Definitely in the top 3 Fish-n-chips I have ever had. They also have really tasty coffee and you can order yourself a coconut if you're feeling squirrelly. Overall a fabulous place to spend an hour or two enjoying a perfect meal. Definitely take out-of-towners here to show off our amazing city.",

    "text": "We went here on a double date night with some good friends who are also foodies, to celebrate the last day of school.  The parking lot was small but as soon as we walked in to the lawn area we were in awe of just the space itself!  Ocotillo's menu is small but packed with quite a flavorful punch with crazy but super delicious combos.    To start with, the four of us started with 3 \"Small\" (one was vegetables) plates.  I wish I could remember all of them, but they do change out items fairly often and the menu doesn't have all the same items as when we were there about a month ago.  One was a salmon dish with super super thinly sliced salmon.  The Crispy Chicken Meatballs were to die for with crispy coconut on the outside and the green curry sauce added a nice tang as well.  The Pecan Wood Smoked Beets were a surprise for me.  I'm just not a beets fan at all and had only ever had the canned slimy grossness at Thanksgiving.  But these were simply divine with the pistachios and ricotta.    Then, we ordered 3 of the large plates.  I wasn't as fully impressed with my dish, the Crispy Whole Fish for two.  I'm not one to enjoy my dinner looking at me and this one came with the head and eyes still right there...staring at me.  But the presentation was definitely on pointe.  At the time, it came with the most buttery tasting brown rice (except it was coconut oil I think).  My friends each got the Pork Shank, which was HUGE, and super juicy and then the Ocotillo Chicken.  It's fairly new to the neighborhood and well worth a visit!  Go with friends so you can share multiple dishes and flavors.",

The only reason they are not getting 5 stars is they undercooked the ribeye- but better undercook than over - and- they didn't have the two wines I wanted to order. However the clams and pork belly was delicious although know the pork has a smoky flavor. The pastas are fresh made. I highly recommend the burrata pasta- the burrata is light and the sauce is thicker and has a tiny bite to it- it's a fabulous combination.",

I can never say no to pasta, so I went with the Orchettie pasta and it was delicious! It came with a rich, smokey goat cheese that balanced perfectly with the pesto.  I will have to say, the menu presentation is a bit difficult to read, both in print and online. However, that was easy to ignore after such an enjoyable meal!  Ocotillo also has a large, beautiful property with 3 outdoor patios and even space for yard games. It's still too hot to enjoy during the day, but I can't wait to come back when it's cooler!",

No regrets there--it allowed for a satisfying combination of savory and sweet.  Loved the modern decor and cozy ambiance here.

    "text": "How have I never been here?! The husband and I were in search of something downtown so we went to Yelp and up popped Ocotillo. Every review was great and every photo looked amazing but the big seller for us was that Iron Skillet Pancake. So we headed on over. It was still nice out so we decided to sit in the Beer Garden. The sun was shining,  misters were full blast, the people outside were all cheerful, and we enjoyed watching it all. We of course had the Iron Skillet Pancake, Mixed Berry Compote, with Powdered Sugar and Maple Syrup. Originally my husband ordered this but we ended up switching 1/2 way because everything was so amazing. I loved that bit of char on the bottom, and how they got that pancake so perfectly fluffy will forever boggle my mind, the sweet compote was the perfect topping. It's funny, when it first came out I thought no way would we get through 1/2. It was so good that there were only about 3 bites left. Had to call it quits. We also ended up with the Breakfast Chimichanga, Scrambled Eggs, Grilled Chicken, Black Beans, Green Chili Sauce, Queso Fresco, and Cilantro. I could put that Green Chili Sauce on an old leather shoe and devour it. The tortilla was perfectly crisp and crunchy. I do have to say the only negative thing about our meal was I only saw 3 little pieces of chicken in the burrito, but it was still delicious and we cleared that plate. As for beverages I am not able to drink right now so I got the Ginger, Mint, Lemonade. Very tart and refreshing that summer day. My husband got the Bloody Marry. Everything is from scratch so it was very chunky. He loved that but some people might not so beware. Speaking of from scratch. They are a seasonal kitchen so also beware that their menu is forever changing to fit what that season brings. I love that. Makes everything taste so fresh. So I cant wait to come back to have cocktails and to enjoy more of their delicious seasonal food.",

It is, after all, the least fun of the seven deadly sins, and coveting your neighbor's wife seems like a bad move (he's a lot bigger than me, and she's kind of busted anyway). But I must admit I turned a bit green at the sight of Ocotillo.  The food is good, and the service is better (shout out to my man Macalister), but it's the space that inspires the envy. It's gorgeous, and it could basically never exist in NYC. It's massive, with a coffee bar, a beautiful dining room, and this expansive patio with huge communal tables appropriately spaced, comfortable seating around a firepit, and more.   We were seated outside under some heatlamps (even though it was warmer than January has a right to be), and even if dinner wasn't delicious, drinks around the firepit seem like a great idea. But dinner was delicious.   I was lucky enough to share just about everything that came out, and there were very few misses. The hits I'd recommend:  The Ocotillo Chicken. I'm usually against ordering chicken, but almost always down to order something named after the house, and I'm happy I went with the latter impulse. Big flavors, perfectly executed, go for it.   The Cauliflower. Roasted, spiced, and zested, it was about as good as vegetables get.  The Duck Wings. I didn't see them on the menu, so I'm not sure if they were a special, but they were the best thing I ate all night.",

Great service even in their busiest hours and the food is phenomenal! Also, as a photographer, I love and appreciate the Mike Olbinski prints hanging throughout the restaurant. Kudos! I'm definitely going back to try brunch and take advantage of their pasta night! I highly recommend checking this place out!",

    "text": "Our second time there. Tried it for dinner. The inside seating is quite crowded, pretty loud as well. For the prices of the food, I'd expect a bit more intimacy through out the dinning rooms. Service was nice a bit on the 2 slow side. We ordered 2 dry martini's with olives. The martinis were $13 each with an additional $2 change for olives?! Glasses were small and not even filled. The steak I had was flavorful but had a ton of fat on it. Not a fan of putting the steak on the potatoes? Brussels Sprouts were ok. My husband had the ribs and enjoyed them, thought French fries was a odd side? How about options, Baked potatoes, mashed? The prices are higher but portions are huge. The patios were really nice.  Perhaps we'll try it for lunch or brunch one day.",

    "text": "I wish I had experienced what all of these rave reviews had! I feel that this is a restaurant that is trying really hard to be trendy but has nothing to back it up.  The menu is all over the place with no real continuity and overpriced. There also wasn't anything special about the food itself. For example, the roasted cauliflower which my friend said was wonderful and I saw someone else on here post as being amazing...it literally tasted like a plain piece of cauliflower that had been placed in the oven. No seasoning, no oil, or garlic...just a plain cooked piece of cauliflower which you could cook at home for $3 and here it costs $15.   I also can't get on board with a place that thinks they are too hip to carry ranch or have a name like ocotillo but no Mexican beer.   Our server was very sweet but couldn't handle her tables making for mediocre service.   All in all, I was so disappointed as this place had good atmosphere but was pretentious with poor service and below average food. Don't waste your time or money. The only reason I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because they made a good margarita.",

    "text": "I had high expectations of Ocotillo based on the experiences I'd heard about from trusted friends, family, previous Yelp reviews, and having worked with both Chef Walter and Dave Johnson at previous endeavors over the years.  I was hesitant to plan a special group dinner there without firsthand experience, but after meeting with Steve, their onsite event planner, and getting a tour of the space (indoor, outdoor, coffee bar, etc...), I was more excited than ever.  I'm proud to say that my high expectations were not only met, but exceeded.  Five sexy stars for a fabulous and very memorable group dinner we had at Ocotillo last Thursday night!  We curated an incredible menu based on our budget and the dietary preferences of those in my group, and I believe that everyone was more than satisfied.  Huge shout-out to MacAllister for handling our group of 21 with ease.  The Cauliflower appetizer was a clear highlight - if you're at Ocotillo, you cannot miss it;  I'm still thinking about it!  I also loved the Carrot Fattoush appetizer.  Entrees are large portions, but my group did well with them... we're good eaters!  I had the Ocotillo Chicken and was pleased.  I also tasted the Wood Fired Beef Ribs and I can say that both the ribs and the fries served alongside them are definitely worth the splurge!  I don't think you can make a wrong decision here as I saw others enjoying the pastas, fish, and even the Falafel Burger!  As hard as it was, we saved room for dessert and I was so glad that we did... I recommend the apple tart, but again, I'm sure you cannot go wrong.  Ocotillo offers a huge list of wine, beer and cocktails as well.  They've got you covered with whatever ambiance you're seeking from casual bar seating or more fine dining inside, plenty of outdoor options (which is where we ended up and it worked perfectly), and even a coffee bar, which I will definitely be back to visit ASAP.  I hear they have a special kids menu and do an incredible brunch as well.  Already looking forward to returning very soon!  Thank you Team Ocotillo!",

We had a group dinner on the patio, spread out between two picnic tables, with plenty of heat lamps to keep us warm on a chilly night.   I'm currently doing Whole30 and am very limited to what I can eat. I was super excited to learn that the cauliflower starter could be modified to leave out the peanuts. The cauliflower was absolute perfection and the kale pesto was to die for - probably the best thing I ate all week!   Our server was an absolute sweetheart, and since he had previously done Whole30 as well, he was able to help me make a sensible dinner selection. I ordered the burger over veggies with a side of broccoli rabe in lieu of fries. The broccoli rabe was... broccoli rabe, but the burger was absolutely delicious and the homemade dijonaise alongside was heaven. I wanted to cry when the giant, beautiful desserts were placed on our table but I know there will be another visit to Ocotillo the next time I'm in the area. Coming for you, apple dessert thingy.",

The polenta-crusted eggplant was amazing!  The crunch of the polenta was so satisfying with the soft eggplant, and nice salad with it (with some very hot peppers, whew!).  The reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because the duck confit raviolis were...okay.  I was not in love with them, though I did like the peaches and cherries in the dish.  My husband's beef ribs were outstanding (you bet I tried them!) and came right off the bone.  The french fries were good, but we don't much like cilantro (each to pick off at least), and no real taste of lime.  So a good french fry, but still just a french fry.  We took dessert home and it really didn't survive that well, so eat dessert there if you have room left!  I'm sure we'll be back to try some other goodies--it was so hard to decide what to try!",

You can have a meal, lounge around while having cocktails or some coffee.   The food is delicious!!! The portions are just right. I tried several appetizers that were all great.

The property is very well designed with distinct spaces for dining indoors, dining outdoors, sipping in the beer garden, casual relaxation around a gas fire pit, kids lawn, or grabbing a coffee and pastry at the coffee bar \"O to go\".  We were a party of five for dinner with a reservation for 6:30pm on a Wednesday night and after dinner we had a brief tour from front of house Manager, David Johnson, and he told us about future plans for an outdoor trellis, which will create another fantastic outdoor space along Flower Street.  Highly recommend starting with vegetable small plates to share, we had the Roasted Cauliflower, Pecan Wood Smoked Beets, and King Trumpet Mushrooms; all very well prepared and unique.  The cauliflower had a wonderful evenly cooked light brown roast color that paired perfectly with the light pesto sauce and the beets were quite unique with a very light smoky flavor that paired nicely with the ricotta and tantalized the palate.  The mushrooms were very nice, recommend cutting up the egg to let the yolk and mix together with the salad and mushrooms.  Main courses arrived very timely after we finished our starters, not immediately, but just the right amount of time.  One couple shared the Crispy Whole Fish for two, which is fried whole with delicious flaky moist fish with crispy skin.  Two others in the party each had the Ocotillo Chicken, which was perfectly roasted and paired with an amazing potato salad; one of our party doesn't eat potato salad, but found this one to be perfect with the chicken.  I had the Mesquite Grilled Ribeye, which was perfectly cooked and a very nice cut of beef; great char on the outside with perfect temp on the inside - paired with roasted fingerling potatoes and mushrooms.  We finished with a shared dessert of a roasted granny smith apple with cinnamon ice cream and drizzled with caramel and pecans; a very nice balance of sweet & tart, crispy & creamy, and warm & cool.  Wait staff was very attentive and friendly.  My wife and I went back the next day to try the coffee bar.  Great Cafe Au Lait and Latte.  They had a blueberry scone, which was moist and delicious.  Nutella Croisant was great, but a little messy.",

The roasted cauliflower was delicious and the Ocotillo Chicken was a fabulous flavor pairing!  We will definitely return for more fresh, innovative and delicious food!",

Walked in to a big group gathered in the foyer area, which we later learned was a corporate event, but were greeted immediately by the hostess with a smile. We were quickly shown to our seats and approached by our server (so nice and professional). Service was quick yet attentive. All the staff was friendly and welcoming, they have an all-around cool vibe going on. The food was phenomenal. Started with the roasted cauliflower, the hype is real. I got the lumache pasta which was presented in an iron skillet--amazing! The other people I was with got the pork shank which fell right off the bone. Welcoming, great ambience, professional and delicious. Our expectations were more than exceeded and everyone had a great time, we will definitely be back!",

    "text": "We went here for dinner on a Wednesday night. The space is nice. We loved the outdoor seating (that's where we sat), but we also liked the look and feel of the indoor space. We ordered the Sazerac cocktail, the gin cocktail,pork steak, the wings, and the Campanelle pasta dish. The cocktails were good. The pork steak was good...until we tasted mint in the dish. What? Mint did not go with the dish at all, it was as if someone in the kitchen accidentally grabbed the wrong greens!!! But the worst part is that half of the dish was completely raw!! Next, we had the wings...nothing special. If you eat wings and get all messy, you want it to be worth all the ness in and around and between your nails..this was not worth the mess. The last dish we had was the campanelle pasta. It was pretty good, but not really good. Not the kind of good that makes you want to cone back. I have to be honest that it was quite surprising to see that they had not taken the raw pork steak off of our bill. Bad move, Ocotillo. My husband and I love food. We love trying new restaurants. We love finding new favorites. Unfortunately we will not be back to Ocotillo and we will not recommend it to our friends.",

Last night, a Saturday, we tried some of the new dishes.  The Persian cucumbers with miso and peppers was crunchy with a great combination of cool and spicy flavors.  Next up was our favorite: sliced & grilled summer squash with squash blossoms, pesto, some yummy breadcrumbs and a sauce that brought the whole thing together.  FIsh loving Hubby had the fresh halibut special with Israeli couscous, and he gave it 5 stars.  I had the housemade cavarecce pasta with a lusciously spicy sauce and surprise: a few bites of sweet crunch  - carrots I think?  We still had room for the Almond Joy to share: 2 scoops each of coconut & chocolate sorbet wi toasted almonds, perfect on a hot summer evening. David the sommelier came up with a Spanish white wine that paired perfectly with the halibut, I had the Sazerac with my pasta, great cocktail from their mixologist.   There are new salads that I can't wait to try on a lunch visit, small gems lettuce & buttermilk dressing and a fresh carrot offering were two.  New season, new experiences at a favorite spot.",

    "text": "This is a hip and trendy place that has a nice atmosphere. We sat in the dining room which was so loud that it was hard to hold a conversation. While it was a busy time of the evening, it just seems like they should do something about  absorbing some of the noise although, due to the layout, I am not cetain how this could be accomplished.  Linda was our server. She was sweet and always had a smile. Made us feel real comfortable but she seemed like she had so many tables to wait on that we didn't see her that often. She was attentive when she was there so nothing bad could be said about her. As for the food service, it seemed like we were waiting a long time just to place out initial order. Once it was placed the food took some time to get to the table. That being said, it was the busy time of dinner which could be the reason for this.  The food had some interesting combinations which piqued our interest right away. I ordered the Peking Duck with palenta. The palenta was creamy and delicious but the duck was dry. Now normally duck can dry out quickly but this was dry to the point of being tough. With what they charge for the duck the kitchen should have taken more time to ensure it was cooked correctly. My partner ordered the ribeye steak which he stated lacked flavor. He actually made the comment that the flatiron steak at Southern Rail had more flavor. That is like comparing apples and oranges when talking about cuts of beef, but that was his opinion. He thinks the price was also high for the quality of the food. As an appetizer we shared the Ricotta plate. This was incredibly flavorful and I would deintely recommend it. For dessert our server suggested the Trifle. This was a flavorful way to end dinner.  We have wanted to try this place out since we saw it open. Unfortunately neither of us were impressed with the food and the high price just made it that much worse.",

Taste was on point but again, a lot of fat... We expect fat with ribs but these ribs were very fatty.   Wine menu was fun but I'd pass on the food.

What do you get when your restaurant has received good press and you have an awful staff who thinks you're putting them out by dining at their establishment? Answer: Ocotillo. Upon entering the restaurant through the (very cute and comfortable) foyer, we were greeted by quite possibly the rudest hostess on the face of the planet. Mind you, we had reservations for Sunday brunch, had shown up right on time, if not, early and only required a table for four. Once the hostess got around to having us seated (yes, she couldn't be bothered to grab menus and take us there herself), we were left unattended for 17 minutes. 17!!!!!! We weren't very far from the airport and realized going anywhere else would've just wasted an entire day, so, 17 minutes is better than 45. Once we ordered our drinks, we waited yet another 10 or so to get them delivered. These weren't four Ramos Fizzes, or anything, just two glasses of wine and two beers. Once we received our drinks, we ordered. The food took a while, but we did have a medium burger, so, I won't complain about that. Our food came and OH. MY. GOD. The chimichanga ALMOST made up for the horrific service. Listen, if you can tough through the torture that is the awful service and pretentiousness that are the employees, you should come here for brunch. The food is delightful, but the service absolutely destroyed my rating of this place.",

Our waitress was slow.  She kept asking me if I wanted my burger exactly like my wife's.  No, hers is Ellen done with nothing on it.  Mine is medium with everything.  She brought whit wine instead of red. Hard to believe.  She disappeared without taking the next two closest tables order. They just sat there. Her skills set was lacking.  The beef was tasty.  We heard comments from those nearby that there was a hundred twenty five dollar steak on the menu.  Most took it as a joke.  We heard them say the most ever paid was fifty five dollars in the past.  Perhaps it was the loud special event in the courtyard that contributed to an unpleasant evening. The bad news is we still have twenty left on the gift card.",

Delicious homemade pastries, good beverages, and a quiet, pleasant, stylish and spacious courtyard in which to hang out (with both sun and shade, grass and concrete, even with bike parking!).    Went back later for brunch - lots of affordable vegetarian items on the menu, and they did not disappoint!  Portions were large and we had a really delicious fresh salad.  However, they seemed a bit understaffed and while service was fine, it wasn't memorably fantastic.  But the worst of it was that there seemed to be some sort of bachelorette party going on with a truly horrible DJ - soulless, bass-thumping \"music,\" way too loud.  There was nowhere you could sit to avoid the music. Unfortunately I couldn't wait to get out of there.  The music ruined the whole ambience as it didn't go with the space at all - something more mellow and soulful (and not quite so loud) would have made the experience so much better!",

The inside though is quite noisy. If you are planning on having a good convo with someone you might think about sitting outside to actually hear them and not have to talk loud. The back seating area is the best. They have long picnic type tables to sit at which makes it nice for groups. Service was definitely lacking though. We sat for about 5 mins before a waiter actually came over to us. The food was decent. Nothing I could rave about but it might have been just what I got. The others in my party seemed to enjoy their food. So minus the service which is why I did not give it 5 stars I'd say this place is decent.",

    "text": "Hair in my food. Continue reading for the full story... When we first pulled up to this place we thought it was closed down because of the way the outside looked. It looks like a rusty, run down metal shack with dried/dead weeds all over the lawn. Ew Once we parked and got out we could see it was open and was trying to look trendy and hip. It had kind of a weird set up. There were four separate buildings that encircled a courtyard. It's was interesting.  The decor and food seemed very very \"hipster\" like. Not bad, but a little strange for us. Was still nice. The windows at the top of the building didn't have shades that could be pulled down to block the sun, and it was annoying to have the sun in my eyes the whole time I was eating.  I had a salmon blt type sandwich and my husband had the pork steak. Food tastes great and the seasoned fries were delicious..... But this is where this review goes downhill... I picked up a French fry, about to eat it, when suddenly something caught my eye. I looked closer and saw there was a black hair sitting on my fry, sort of underneath the seasoning. I looked closer to make sure and even had my husband look closely at it. Sure even, it was a shiny 1 1/2\" long black hair. Immediately grossed out, I stopped eating and pushed my food away. I had only eaten half of my sandwich and fries. When the waitress came over, we told her about the hair and I pointed to it on the fry. Her response was something like \"oh...\" And when I said I was done she said \"ok cool\".  Um, there was a human hair on my food and that was the response? She picked up our plates and immediately went and got our bill and deposited it on the table. There was no mention of comping us for my food at all.  I was really irritated by that. We asked to speak to the manager, and she got a little flustered so we just explained that it wasn't cool to charge us for the food when there was a hair on it. She quickly explained that she was going to take care of it and that we weren't going to be charged. That would've been nice to hear right from the get go.  Now this is what made me furious. We were chatting with her and she said \"I don't wanna down play it at all, you know, but it looked more like just a fuzzy than a hair..\" WHAT?! I'm sorry, but she never asked to see it closely to see what we were seeing. If she couldn't see it, she should have said so, so that I could have shown her closer! My husband and I both examined it very thoroughly and we KNOW it was a BLACK HAIR! She could sense I was about to lose it and got the manager for us.  When the manager came over, he said that he was told that I found a fuzz on my food. OMFG!!! We immediately corrected him and told him we saw very clearly that it was a black hair! He apologized profusely and also apologized for how the waitress handled things. I sincerely believed him when he said things like that don't happen and that it was abnormal, so I don't want people reading this thinking that they shouldn't try this place at all. I'm mostly mad about the way it was handled. It was like I was being patted on the head while being told \"oh I'm sure it wasn't REALLY a hair...\"   I appreciate the way the manager handled things. I really hope they ensure people in the back are wearing hairnets. I took one star away for the way the outside looked, it just looked so nasty with the rusted metal.  We might try this place again for brunch, and possibly improve this review. I would give it another try in the future.",

    "text": "Wow, I am still perplexed by the crappy service and food, we just experienced. Let's start front the beginning. We had a reservation for 6 at 11:15. We were seating and all was good. It took 15 minutes for them to take our drink orders  20 minutes after that we got our drinks. Another 5 minutes after drinks arrived to get glasses to drink our drinks as we ordered pitchers. Then we were informed that there were no chimichanga for brunch at 11:30 right after they opened.  Then the drinks themselves: Pitcher of Sangria really watered down and way to much ice. Bloody Mary pitcher was just tomato juice and horseradish, one of the worst we have tasted.  The  food arrived not all together and items missing. When they brought out the 2 burgers They said Med rare and well done. They never asked us how we wanted them cooked. I said none of us would order well done and we were not asked how we want them cooked. They took it back and then can back 30 seconds later and placed it down in the table. We cut into it, and it was the well done burger. We decided after all the f up's we would just deal wth it. Tired of all the errors and we were hungry! The food itself was satisfactory nothing I would ever say I need to come back and eat again. Then the bill came and  they charged one of the 3 cards twice. It was a total cluster and the food was just average with no seasoning. They need to get it together. We will never be back! This was the worst experience. Not the worst food, but the worst experience.  Update It only gets worse We gave it a second try and order sangria only to be told they are out of sangria... Wth... Go to Safeway and buy cheap wine, fruit, brandy, simple syrup whatever you use.  I guess I'm a glutton for punishment.",

I'm going to rate our server above the food however, she was awesome, on top of everything and even made an adjustment to a request that we had without us having to ask - I think she knew we hesitated and asked us instead. The drink selection was great and so was the wine I had. Dinner and apps were all wonderful, the only downside was our fish was a bit overcooked and laid on the grill longer than it should have. Which can suck when that's your entree, but hey, everything else I would definitely go back for.",

The beets we ordered were flavorful, and my pappardelle was absolutely delicious. I usually stay away from this dish, since it can be extremely greasy and heavy. At Ocotillo, it was exactly right -- fresh, unctuous, and a little bit spicy. I will happy return next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "Second visit to this beautiful space, and it was a definite hit.  Reserved for two and since we were a bit early had a drink at the bar.  Wine list is very cool, with an unusual \"symbolic\" profile for each selection. Really pretty cool so you know exactly what you're getting when you order. Excellent BTG selection. Interesting list of house special cocktails. Highly recommend if you're in the mood for something different.   After our libation we were seated at a very comfy booth near the bar, in sight of the kitchen - which was sparkling clean btw with the cooks laser focused on their stations. The menu had changed somewhat since our first visit so we were interested to try new things.   First course, we split a salad.  All are large enough to share. We chose the Watermelon, mango, avocado, arugula with toasted coconut.  Superb.  Very refreshing with an excellent range of textures and nice balance of the sweeter mango and melon with the peppery arugula. Perfectly dressed as well.   Next was a halibut ceviche.  Great portion as well.  Halibut succulent, not chewy as some can be when the acid is applied too early.  Ripe tomatoes added a nice color and offset the tomatillo puree nicely.  The surprise addition of corn nuts really made the dish as it added a great bit of crunch and saltiness.  Well done.   Third came a pita and spicy Dahl dish with blistered shishito peppers, olives and a bit of salad.  The Dahl was outstanding, not really hot spicy, but very flavorful with just enough kick.  A good meatless choice and enough to share...most definitely.   For entrees, the lady had the scallops from the small plates section.  Perfectly seared with nice crust outside and buttery smooth inside. Sauce had just enough acid to make the buttery scallops pop!  I chose the Crispy Duck Confit.  Again, a great portion. Duck fall off the bone tender, yet crispy crunchy skin intact.  Accompanied by some stone ground grits and a sweet cherry based relish that was a great counterpoint to the richness of the duck.   By this time we were too full and dessert was not in the cards for us...next time.   Can't wait until summer heat subsides and the patio opens up. Will be a great place to hit for lunch or dinner...or drinks!  Oh, BTW...service was outstanding.  When you go, consider yourself fortunate if Eli is your guy.  He's great...so we're the bartenders!  We'll be back soon with friends.  Go...soon!",

    "text": "This was our first time here after driving by their billboard for several months. This really was one of the places you have to experience instead of reading reviews - ironic, I know.  We started with a couple of expertly crafted cocktails: Bumble Bee for my date and I ordered a Boulevardier myself. We started with a Tomato Tartine with these beautiful squash blossoms and a nice light, whipped  lemon ricotta. Our entrees were carefully selected because literally everything on the menu had me salivating and I could've starved to death if I hadn't just picked something, ANYTHING. Our server brought us the Beef ribs - a rewarding 4 bone, mole bbq dripping, charred serving of meaty goodness and the Radiotore shrimp pasta dish in a beautiful white whine sauce. I was satiated after the tartine but the lure of the server running the dishes by our table was way too enticing. So we indulged and indulged some more with a bottle of wine and the most decadent chocolate cake with fresh whipped cream cream and juicy seasonal black cherries. I could've licked my plates. As if the pristine food and the knowledgeable and warm staff couldn't have elevated this experience any more I was very pleased to make a new friend with my visit to the washroom; the hospitality was extended by the house cat, a precocious white and black kitty with Frida-esque \"eyebrows\" making sure everyone washes their hands. The staff rescued the little feline from a shelter and she's been working on site policing the property ever since.  At first I thought it was too bright and kind of noisy but later just came to terms with it because they obviously wanted you to get the full visual of the presentation of their food and everyone was buzzing about their experience. I can't wait to go back. I have 2 more menus to order from once i've tried everything on the dinner menu. Thanks Nicole and the back of the house for this refreshing culinary experience. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it has to be too good to be True.",

Here's the deal,  our server was an awesome guy when he showed up but he showed up so few times I didn't know what to think of it.  He could've been busy,  he had a table inside and out so maybe that's why but you know what that's not my problem.  That's all on management.. Maybe they need better management or more staff..  I mean I was there on a Friday night you had to know if would be busy..    Let's move on..  The food... My pasta was blah..  I couldn't care for it,  lacked flavor and the sauce left a lot to be desired. My friend liked her fish dish and couldn't stop raving about it. Maybe its just me..    The dessert was uninspired too. Two of of the the desserts were just lame. Also we had asked for coffee with desserts but that came about fifteen minutes later.  Or server remarked he had spent two months figuring out how to use the equipment.  He's probably better off spending another 2 trying to get better at it because the coffee was the most watered-down substandard swill I've had to date.   So here was my experience to sum it up: poor service poor food, poor drinks.  The next time around it won't be so bad, but it will take me awhile to get over this one.",

The decor... the architecture... the diversity and overall use of space... and perhaps my lack of enthusiasm is largely influenced by the service (or lack thereof) but my brunch experience was a disappointment.   I had the grapefruit brulee and the beet salad.   The beet salad is served on a bed of herbed ricotta and while generally good, was nothing noteworthy. I would've liked a piece of bread or crostini to accompany the plate.  The grapefruit was effectively bruleed -- which is not an easy task, if you'd ever tried it at home.  However, no one took the time to section the grapefruit and it was not served with a grapefruit spoon. I realize this may sound petty but the ambiance and the menu descriptions lend themselves to a more upscale experience.   When I requested a spoon (since none -- serrated or not -- was brought with my food), I was given a large soup spoon which was not a practical option for a grapefruit (-- bruleed or not).   On a second request, I was brought a sundae spoon which was better sized but lacked the serration.  Honestly, I feel ridiculous typing this because I realize it sounds so menial but in addition to being a peeve, the utensil exemplified the ineffective service.",

    "text": "Ocotillo is quite the handsome restaurant. From the outside, it makes a strong first impression -- especially at night. The architecture and lighting blend wonderfully into the surrounding environment. It's as inviting as it is sexy.  It's also pretty inventive. As I am wont to do, I began my evening with a cocktail. My #16 was a desert surprise of deliciousness. Were I not so OCD about wine with dinner, I would have happily sipped on this all night. The dining portion of the evening started just as strong. Many reviews are going to spend time talking about the Carrot Fattoush Salad. There is a reason for this. It's divine and when ordered without pita, it's gluten-free. The salad is an intensely deliberate mix of greens, carrot hummus, herbs (I don't know which; they've gotta be secret, like the Colonel made famous), feta, seeds, and coriander vinaigrette. Yes, that dressing is a real thing and it's spectacular. Not to be outdone, the cauliflower appetizer (a delightful concoction of the vegetable, kale pesto, lemon, olive oil, basil, mint,  and peanuts) and the duck confit also pressed my buzzer and rang my bell. I was riding high off the incredible start to the meal and the evening. I turned to my friend with wide-eyed incredulousness as to what we were experiencing.  Strong start.  Unfortunately, the finish didn't compare. By no means was the second part of the meal poor. But the beginning of the evening was so stellar that coming down to earth where the mere mortals roamed was a comparative disappointment. The service which had been be-my-guestish turned a bit perfunctory. It get it: waiting on a large group with seemingly insatiable demands gets to a person. Again, I don't want it to seem as though things ever got rude. Just relative to the start, the shift was noticeable. I received a weak pour of an ordinary-tasting cab. Yes, first world. But relative to the cocktail, noticeable. My Ocotillo Chicken entree was more exciting on the page than the plate. The intoxicating description (chilies, citrus, honey, and herbs served with a roasted pecan and date potato salad) didn't live up to the execution. The chicken, while nicely cooked (juicy and not at all dry) was rather bland, especially when given the flavor bomb with which it was prepared. The potato salad lacked the interesting wow I anticipated given the unusual recipe. I didn't have a chance to taste the dessert options as none were gluten-free. I wasn't too put out. I'd had a very filling and -- on-the-whole -- satisfying meal. Yes, it was a bit uneven but nothing that should make anyone shy away from experiencing Ocotillo for him/herself. If I were to return, I would make an evening of the cocktail menu and vegetables. Both are just that good. Actually, they're better.",

Pork and chicken wings were perfect and more importantly, they were not salty (there is always a huge debate on why American foods are so salty among my friends and family members visiting the U.S. :P). I will come back for their chicken soon!",

We had an issue that came up and ended up having to scramble to find a place to host our party, and Walt was really great at helping us get everything organized with just a week's notice. He reserved the Chef's Ramada for us, and it was beautifully set up when we got there. Eli was our server and he was so friendly and accommodating and did a great job serving our large party. Most of the party was just drinking, but I did order the pita and hummus plate and it was amazing-much more decadent than a traditional hummus plate. Some of our guests ordered entrees and said they were all delicious! The drinks were all very yummy and I was super impressed by the very reasonable prices on drinks! It was a perfect place to celebrate and all 30 of our guests left happy and satisfied. I really appreciated the ability to split checks, and again just how accommodating everyone was throughout the experience. And it was such a beautiful, perfect ambiance. Thank you so much!",

The outdoor area was set up beautifully and easily accommodated our group of approximately 150 people for milling around, visiting and buffet style dinner service. The servers were extremely helpful, friendly and professional - especially Eli. Unique and delicious appetizers were offered during the cocktail hour, followed by an excellent selection on the buffet. I'm not usually a fan of buffets, but everything I tried was delicious. Particularly tasty were the Ocotillo Chicken, the Roasted Cauliflower and Kale and the Potatoes Au Gratin. I did not have a chance to look at their other menus, but based on this experience, I would guess they have lots of great options. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "My husband and I attended a birthday dinner for a friend on Friday night. We had heard mixed reviews from friends about this place but thought we would give it a try when we received the invitation for dinner.  We had 3 tables reserved outside for a b-day event.  When we arrived at 6:30, we went inside to the bar to grab a drink before the festivities started.  We ordered 3 drinks ($34.00) and while we were waiting, a waiter comes in and asks us if we were with the large table outside, we said yes, and then he said you can just order your drinks from me I 'm the waiter.  We told him we had already ordered but we would order from him moving forward. Our waiter said \" fine you can just order your drinks in here all night\" and then he stormed off.  We were left there with our jaws hanging to the ground in disbelief of what we just witnessed.  Our host was required to pay $200 for the privilege of bringing 35 people for drinks and dinner at their establishment.    The food was OK but certainly not worth the prices.   The Ocotillo concept is good but the execution is very poor. We will not be coming back.  Updated post 4.30.16 After my post, the GM reached out to me to ask me who our server was, which I told him because I still had the receipt.  The GM reached out to me again saying that my post was inaccurate and mean.    Correction-I spoke with the host of our group, he told me the event manager required a $200 fee to hold the 3 tables outside, which was not a deposit but instead a non-refundable fee, our host refused to pay that.  Then our host asked for separate checks to make it easier on his guests and they wanted a $200 fee to process separate checks which our host also refused to pay.    Additionally, the food was not that great given the price.  The Casserolet's beans were undercooked, the Pork Shank had under-cooked onions in it.   There are far too many wonderful restaurants in the area to be doing business like this.",

    "text": "I tried to like it, but the food falls very short. Nothing tastes fresh and everything is way overpriced.   Let me first start by saying that I work nearby and we were really excited for a new place to eat. I have been to Ocotillo 5 times now and each time has been progressively worse. Four of my visits were for lunch and one was an attempt at a happy hour. I say attempt because they have no happy hour, at all. We left for another place in the area after we had already ordered a drink and told they were closing soon. The servers don't know anything about the alcohol being offered, it's clear that there is no training or knowledge being given to them. They have also been out of most of their wine offerings the two times that I've tried to order.   Walking in, the first thing you will notice is that it's very, very noisy. They keep the music really loud and all of the hard surfaces cause voices to echo and reverb over your conversation. Don't expect to have a decent conversation or even hear your server unless you sit outside.   The roasted cauliflower was OK, but it would be hard to ruin such a simple dish.  The diver scallop ceviche tasted terrible. The scallops were chewy and I was pretty sure it was several days old.  The mole chicken salad comes with chicken nuggets covered in a flavorless brown sauce that almost resembles chocolate and for a \"field greens\" salad, it was 90% shredded cabbage.  The country pate is on par with Spam. It's dry, flavorless and sliced out. It was impossible to spread on the provided oversized bread that was better suited for bruschetta. For $14, I expected more than just a plate of a bunch of pickled greens and spam.  The smoked salmon sandwich tasted like it's been sitting in the fridge for a week.  The BBQ pork sausage sandwich came with raw sliced jalapeno which made it totally inedible The brisket sandwich some how made it past expedition burnt and what little meat it had was mostly fatty. The caramelized onions and red peppers tasted like they came from a can.  The \"crispy tofu\"  Bahn MI was awful. The tofu was over cooked and had no flavor.  The Thai chicken dinner was incredibly salty, I'm pretty sure it had been sitting for days to have soaked up that much sodium. The pure salt content over powered any other flavor they had tried to include.   Now every restaurant has its issues, but each of these visits is over a span of several months. They are well passed the opening jitters. The place is trying to be trendy and hip, but it fails on even the basics. All of the faults appear to be from poor management and bad kitchen practices. It's a shame.",

It's a brown building with a brown small sign that reads Ocotillo.  It's even confusing on where to enter. This place could be a gem! A huge place like that in the heart of the city... One of a kind, sadly they aren't utilizing it well. The bartender took his time getting to us, he didn't present any of their specials or products. We had to beg for any information. When I asked him about the food they were serving, he pointed out the wrong two. I will say, he was personably just not professional. I'd love to see this place boom, but from my experience as a past bartender, server and restaurant manager... Their management is letting them down.",

    "text": "Sadly, this review is based only on about 5 minutes of actual interaction. I've been wanting to try Ocotillo for a while after meeting someone in Kauai who had ties to the owner. We were in the area and decided to give it a shot. First of all, the space is very well done. We were impressed from first entrance. When we walked in, we waited for a few minutes til we were greeted. Not a big deal, since we were checking the place out. Upon sitting down though, the disappointment began. Maybe our server was having a bad day, maybe it's because her shift was ending and she had a table sit down, I don't know, but she was not a happy camper. She offered us an additional beverage to water, and I hadn't quite decided yet, so I told her I would figure it out. My boyfriend inquired if brunch was the only option - she not so pleasantly informed us that brunch is it, and in fact the kitchen was about to close. It was 2:40pm! 1. We were disappointed that the hours aren't more clearly shared on their website. 2. It was really the delivery of this information that made the experience a negative one. The way it was delivered, we definitely had the impression that we were an inconvenience in being there. So, we decided we didn't want to be \"those people\", and got up and left. I have a feeling this isn't how a typical experience at Ocotillo goes, but unfortunately that's how ours went. Of course I'm disappointed we didn't get to try the menu I'd so been looking forward to, but more than that, the service we received was the major downfall.   So for future reference, their kitchen closes at 3pm on Saturdays! Not sure when it reopens, as we never even got that far as to get that information.",

Location: Near 3rd St and Osborn  Service: Pretty good but kinda corny.  The wait staff also didn't believe me when I asked about a salad that was *clearly* on their current web site menu.  He acted like I was an idiot, but the online menu truly did have some foods that were not listed on the paper/in person menu.  However, besides that, he was friendly; food arrived quite quickly.    Atmosphere: The flooring and walls do not absorb sound. It is hard to hear.  Also, some tables are rather too close to each other. I could hear everything the people next to us were saying.   Food/drinks:  I had a salad with squash and pomegranate seeds.  It was super tasty!  The sweet potato with apples was warm and flavorful.    Cost: The cost was somewhat high, but suspect this is due to seasonal local food options.  The food was delicious and flavorful. The servings are quite large. Be prepared to take home leftovers",

Dining in the main inside room was very noisy as the sounds were bouncing off all of the hard surfaces and made it a little hard to carry on a conversation at times.",

    "text": "This is the second time I've been to Ocotillo. The first time was during the day(and it was excellent). This time I went with a group of four for dinner. We started with the house specialty, Roasted Cauliflower, which came with a kale pesto. This is the best cauliflower I have ever tasted. I recommend you go there just to try this dish. 5/5. The second appetizer we consumed was the Chicken Meatballs. This came with shishito peppers, and a light sauce. They were tasty due to the cayenne pepper flavoring which was mixed directly into the meat. However, they were a little bit dry. 4/5.  For our main dishes, I had the Reginette Pasta with a Lamb Ragu. It had great flavoring and had plentiful sun-dried tomatoes mixed in. The Ragu was also plentiful, and the noodles were cooked al dente style, which really added to the flavor and consistency. I highly recommend this dish. 5/5. One other in my party had the Campanella Pasta with roasted mushrooms. It was prepared in a light cream sauce, and it was also very well crafted. 5/5. The next entree we shared was the Ginger Steak. The cut was a ribeye that came with roasted sesame potatoes. It was cooked medium well (not my preference), but was still very enjoyable. 5/5. The final dish we all sampled was the Roasted Fish, which was Halibut prepared with a light sauce. I wasn't overly crazy about this dish as it did not contain the same powerful, well combined flavors as the other meals. 4/5.  For dessert we share the bread pudding and chocolate pie. Both were incredible, And help finish off a great culinary experience. 5/5.  The ambience was absolutely fabulous. We sat outside and the weather was gorgeous. The only complaint I had is that the service was very slow, and some of the wait staff were more concerned with standing around and comparing tattoos then helping the guests. I originally awarded four stars, but was immediately contacted by the GM. Very impressive and conscientious individual who is seeking to improve his restaurant. I now am amending my review and awarding Ocatillo five stars! I highly recommend you try out this restaurant!",

There is a range of outdoor seating and indoor. The long tables outdoors are perfect for an event and the patio is great for a more intimate meal. I've had the roasted cauliflower with kale pesto three or four times and it is literally something that I crave. I am also completely taken with the carrot fatoush salad. It is a super complex, interesting salad with deep flavor. I find the portions generous and unless I have my teenage boys with me, there are leftovers. The only thing that I've tried that wasn't as big of a hit was the falafel burger. The idea is terrific but the outcome is too dry for me.  Overall, great location and great place to meet friends. I see there is also a coffee bar here which I have yet to try. Once more, Phoenix shines with another great restaurant.",

We came in on a busy Friday evening - got lucky finding parking right in front, but someone who came separately had to circle the area before finding a spot.  The indoor crowd is a little on the see-and-be-seen type, it's an upscale place.  We opted for one of the patios - at the end of a long table (there was another party already at the other half of the table - which doesn't bother me, but it might some).  The service was really very slow.  Slow to take our drink order, very slow to bring the first round, and not so speedy bringing the food.  However, when the food did appear, it was just top-notch.  One of my party (who does not pull punches) said the beef ribs were among the best he's ever had.  I had the Ahi tuna, which was just perfect.  So, five stars for the delicious food, minus one for how long you made us wait to get it.",

However, if you want to sit outside with a big group, you may have to wait for a spot in a Sunday or Saturday morning.   The Saturday we went, they happened to have a live DJ there. Not sure if that's a common thing but it definitely added to the ambiance. The food was a bit pricey but you do get what you pay for unlike some other places in central phx that charge too much for the quality they serve. I had the breakfast Chimichanga and it was A-MAZ-ING! My friends and I all shared a bottle of Champs for mimosas as well.   The waitress told us they plan on opening a late night bar that'll be open til 2AM and I def plan on checking that out once it's done!",

The prices were so fair that we ordered four veggie dishes as an \"appetizer\", little did we know each of these dishes could have served as a full meal!  The beets had an outstanding Smokey flavor.  The cauliflower was the most shocking delicious, the kale pesto was rich in herb flavor and reminded me nothing of eating a salad.  The heirloom carrots... just get them.  They were my favorite thing on the entire menu.  You don't have to like carrots to enjoy this amazing dish.  The entrees were amazing, the smoked salmon must have been done in house, some of the best I've ever had.  And the frose was not at ALL like the over-sugared slushies you get at other restaurants.  It was pleasantly tart and refreshing.  And the atmosphere was bright and relaxed, not like the overcrowded brunch spots where you can barely hear yourself speak.  I could go on for hours, I'll stop here!  Just go - trust me!",

The people who I was with (the locals) say its moderately priced so I'll defer to them.  Atmosphere -I didn't go inside but the outside patio part is HUGE and gorgeous with these amazing lights strung up everywhere. There is also a bar and this huge grassy area which is nice for getting your snapchat photo shot on, I'm sure that's probably not what its meant for but that's what we used it for.   Customer Service  Everybody was so nice. My waiter asked me what my name was and used it throughout the evening which I thought was a nice little touch. I have zero complaints about the service.   Food  So me and my group didn't order any entrees but we ate our weight in appetizers and everything that came out was delicious. I was talking to the owner and he was explaining how most of their food is locally sourced and regardless of were you fall on the organic vs. non organic debate, the fact that the food is locally sourced means that the restaurant is good for the local economy and that alone should give it some extra points. I had this fruit platter and I the strawberries tasted like the ones I pick from my garden. There is nothing better than fresh produce!    Overall I came here on the last day of a service trip with ten of my classmates and we all had a great time and left with our bellies full. Great local place!",

Went to Hula's 20 to 30 minute wait for a table. Culinary dropout was booked till 8 o'clock. My daughter called Ocotillo and they gladly excepted our reservation for five people. We were there within 15 minutes and I swear it was just absolutely the perfect place to celebrate! The drinks were amazing, I had a happy hour Pinot Noir that was delicious, and my daughters ordered the drink that had tequila and grapefruit soda? We also ordered six different appetizers that were beyond delicious! Our server was amazing and our food was delivered very quickly. I could not even believe this was a Friday night and we were able to have such a wonderful experience on such a short notice. The place is just so cool! I cannot wait to go back and experience the dinner menu! They have an amazing outdoor space, that was unfortunately not opened because it's the summer and it's very hot outside right now. Can't imagine how beautiful it is in the cooler months! I highly recommend this restaurant!",

I apologize for not remembering what I had specifically (it was not all four!) I had the bourbon drink, a berry concoction. I prefer a more spirit forward, less sour drink, but the ordering was my error. My husband enjoyed his HH beer, and on our second visit, we got a great deal on a bottle of Malbec. Their non-HH drinks are worth a try. I really liked the Spanish GT. Food: All off the Happy Hour Menu, and impressive sized portions. We have tried: The chicken Shawarma (size of a full meal, with greens on side) Arugula salad, Butternut Squash Flautas, Eggplant meatballs, Cassarecce Pasta, and the Baby Back Rib Sandwich. ALL OF IT WAS DELICIOUS! I liked that their was plenty of vegetarian options, in case you are with meatless eaters. This is my new fav place, and I plan to return. It was in the medium price range, and a better quality option compared to many other places that we frequent. Our bartender was busy, but remained friendly & attentive. We were happy",

Fried chicken with polenta was recommended by the waiter, and he was right that the chicken was super tender and the polenta was smooth and silky with the right amount of seasoning. Kale pesto with basil and mint added the highlight to the gigantic roasted cauliflower. The matcha pancake was a lot larger than expected. The matcha flavor was not really standing out, but all pancakes taste good with the right amount of syrup on top. Yum! The decor is contemporary, and the patio is well covered by the mist. Highly recommended for both dinner and brunch!",

    "text": "I'm sorry to say this, but Ocotillo is just another restaurant in the central corridor.  None of the food was bad, but little of it was memorable either.  The area is hip and young...and Ocotillo, like many of the central corridor restaurants, is making a living on that culinary inexperience.  For how long?  I would certainly highlight the service and decor.  Top notch wait staff, hustling, clean kitchen and chic modern decor.  Additionally, the craft cocktails are all creative and crisp.  The bar alone is worthy of a visit.  But dinner...mehhhh.  We were a group of six and sat at the large farm table directly in front of the open kitchen.  Ahead of our visit we read other reviews to zero in on the house specialties.  To start, we family-style sampled the cauliflower, seared tuna, and sweet potato appetizers.  Most reviewers appear to be raving about the cauliflower.  I cannot.  It was just a roasted cauliflower, the same as you do on the grill.  No creative depth of flavors, nor pairing on the plate that can excite.  On the other hand, the sweet potatoes were perfectly roasted and paired with an achiote paste that if you \"butter\" each bite, indeed shows some culinary talent.  However, without the achiote paste, it's unlikely to leave an impression.  We skipped the salad course, as recommended by the very impressive waitress, and ordered four large plates to share.  The beef ribs were recommended but while they were cooked to perfection, they were backstroking in a very saccharine sauce.  If you scrapped off all the sauce, you could taste the barbecue smoke, yum.  But the sauce itself is a super sweet KC style that distracts.  The short rib ravioli was good...but I honestly can't remember any notes of this dish 12 hours later.  The chicken was the highlight.  Not a single area of dry white meat and the seasoning was well worth the order.  And lastly, the grilled shrimp.  Shrimp is very easy to over cook and the kitchen hit the temperature spot on.  However, it needs a more balanced marinade with more acid.  The shrimp was simply bland.  I love that Dave, the GM and our waitress were very attentive.  I have known Dave from other restaurants in the past and he is truly a seasoned restrauntuer.  I believe he listened to all the critique and will act to make changes.  In that light, Ocotillo is probably worth another visit in a month but if changes don't come, I see a remodel and reconceptualization for this space in the near future.  Phoenix has too many phenomenal restaurants. Mediocrity at this price point just doesn't survive.",

As a medical professional My initial post had to be address it with the owner of the restaurant. I do believe that businesses deserve a second chance and to contact the owners for corrective action even after the owner who I contacted threatened me with legal action.  As a consumer when I reached out by request to the owner/Chef Walter S. who posted the response above he was extremely hostile, argumentative, degrading and my level of comfort with the entire phone conversation forced me to disconnect the phone conversation which I recorded. Afterward the owner/chef sent me very hostile and harassing text messages.  Sadly, the Owner/chef was not willing to work with my experience to come to a learning conclusion in fact I requested the money I spent which was never offered back to me for a refund paid forward to another veteran to enjoy a meal I didn't get the opportunity to myself. I truly a learning experience that not all businesses are for or with the customers but for the money and expressing my first amendment right to share my experience. Again the restaurant atmosphere and waitress was wonderful but food no thanks.",

We split a ton of different dishes, but the standouts were the Cauliflower (served in this delicious curry sauce that made me want to lick the plate), Brussel Sprouts, and the Ahi Tuna.  Every one of the small/vegetable dishes we ordered was light and refreshing.  Our individual \"large\" dishes, on the other hand, lived up to that name.  My husband ordered the ribs, which literally melted in your mouth and fell off the bone, but they were SO filling!  We barely even had room for the huge plate of accompanying fries.  I think this dish could probably be split between two people comfortably.  I had the recommended chicken dish, which was delicious.  It was unique that instead of being served over mash potatoes, it was served over a date-potato salad.  We also had some fun cocktails, some sort of caramel custard-dessert and coffee.  We rolled out stuffed and had an absolutely amazing experience.  It's a little expensive but well worth the visit.",

Addition: I left and called, requesting to talk to a manager and was placed on hold. After 8 minutes (I timed it) my fiancee (sitting next to me in the car) called and also requested to speak to a manager. She was asked if she just called, which she replied \"no\" and was placed on hold as well. Note- I am still holding. The manager answered answered HER call after less than two minutes while I was still holding! Unbelievable  *UPDATE: This was the GM's response to me. I guess the customer isn't always right.",

On that visit, orders were wrong, drinks never came, and our stay was over 2.5 hours.  I figured - it's brunch - it's busy - it's a happening place...  My second visit was last night for my birthday with about 15 friends.    First, the server was rude.  I get it - moving around from seat to seat messes with your tracking of checks and orders and such, but the way you asked us to stay in our seats was a little out of line.    Second, my friend asked if you had a Pinot Noir.  No, she didn't look at the menu, but the response of \"yeah, we have three, they're in the menu\" is not ok.   Third, after you took our drink order (MOST OF WHICH WAS WRONG - flat soft drinks, iced tea mixed with coca cola?, wrong wine, etc.) we waited about 45 minutes to get served.  One friend went inside to the bar to get her drink - her Sprite.  Others followed suit.  We then got our own to go boxes, our own salt and pepper, our own extra napkins, thank god for that wait station right next to our table.  Fourth, the bartender was about as rude as he could be.  \"Let me try the..\" \"Oh we're out\".  OK.  Can I finish my sentence first?  Then he came back later yelling at us about something and stormed off.  Fifth.  HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF SILVERWARE AND NAPKINS.  Thank god there was a Safeway nearby so our $50 entree could have those awesome paper napkins.  And thank god there was an extra knife on the table so I could eat my birthday cake.  Sixth. I'm  guessing you didn't get tipped the way you wanted, but I assure you, it's better than you would've received had we left (which we were about to when we had no order taken an hour in). BUT, swearing under your breath as you walked away wasn't the way to let us know. No one ever came to check on us, give us refills, take additional wine orders, clear glasses, etc.    Here's the thing.  This place is GORGEOUS.  the food is AMAZING.  I will never go back because for some reason, they either have the worst people in the world working there, the worst management, or both.",

The food options were diverse but certainly something for everyone. I had a pasta dish and it had great flavor. Lastly, and most important, the service was what set the whole thing apart. Our server's name was Eli and it was as if he was our best friend. He was very personable, knowledgeable, and just a good guy. By the end of the meal we were asking him to join us for a drink.

    "text": "GREAT experience...actually it was AMAZE-BALLS!  It was our second stop at Ocotillo...it's never been the right time to enjoy the outside of their facilities but they look fantastic with large seating areas, a fire pit, and nice landscaping. Inside the food,drinks, and staff were all top notch!    Started with a generous sized mixed green salad with roasted peaches, pistachios, and burrata cheese. The three of us shared it - like everything else it was terrific!  Hubby and BF shared the Rib Eye - served on a wood platter over smashed potatoes with roasted corn.  The steak was perfect, delicious, and prepared just like we ordered it.  I had the Ocotillo Chicken and it was out of this world good!  It was served over a large-chunk potato-salad which might sound odd - but it was really good with sweet and spicy and savory notes all over depending on what part of the dish you were eating.   They have a host of wonderful cocktails - we had a delicious and refreshing gin beverage served in a VERY large glass!  Really enjoyed this visit and looking forward to the next!!",

    "text": "Ate lunch here yesterday and the experience was outstanding!  Entered through a beautifully unique desert-scaped  causeway that called us hither.  Once inside we where greeted warmly by a pleasant young lady (host) and an enormous chef?/owner?  This enormous (in stature/ frame/ heart and inspiration) gentleman transmitted to me in our ten second interaction that we where in for a real treat through his calm/ warm confidence.  The space was modern, sleek and featured an open kitchen in which at least 12 kitchen staff where seen working on what was sure to be artistically delectable food.  And it was!  We had a roasted cauliflower dish that knocked our socks off, an arugula salad whose citric, smokey, earthy, flavors popped while in an intricate dance with the smooth richness of the cheese sprinkled on top.  Then the best part of the meal came out: the citrus chicken.  Very well balanced dish: bright, robust, fire, wood, cream, earth and subtle sweetness.  All paired with a beautifully delicate Albarino, the mineral qualities expressed not lost through the medium body and apricot.  Special kudos to Pat (our waiter) for the wine tasting and well wishes during our stay in his hometown, he made us feel welcomed.",

It was the perfect amount of food since I had just worked out but it would have been too much otherwise because it was a half head of cauliflower! The bone marrow was to die for. I wouldn't change one thing about the dish. However, the cauliflower was over-salted and over zested with citrus juice. It overpowered the delicious bone marrow. Another bummer: there are stellar wines on their list but only 5 out of about 30 of their red wines were available by the glass. Not convenient for someone dining alone. Would go here again with someone else though!",

Requested inside seating since we have the baby, which they accommodated. Great hosts.  We ordered; Strawberries & ricotta - excellent,  I actually order this as a dessert, so good!  Fried cauliflower - good, comes with pesto sauce that's really good! Pita hummus plate - my mom loved it, pita looks legit inhouse made.  Salad (Greek?) - very fresh greens huge salad  Fried chicken & polenta fried egg on top- arrived with a small tiny portion of chicken(scroll down, and why I feel cheated), flattened chicken thigh?!   3rd visit today! Mother's day brunch! I only got 1 good pic! You try eating with a 9month old!   We ordered;  Strawberries & ricotta- still fans Chicken wings - good, temp was warm not hot. Weird. But we still stuffed our faces!  Fried chicken & polenta- ummm grandma's plate came out & looked amazing nice huge portion (we talked about how we got cheated on Easter! Lol! Next time I order this I better get the grandma treatment or sending back!  Smoke beat salad with pistachios- good, for my taste I just added salt & pepper.    Crab pasta dish- sounded & looked good, my husband enjoyed it.   We will definitely be back,  trying to make it there during the week for the dinner fare!",

But the food was just not memorable.  The ribs were okay, would not have them again.  Cauliflower was very good.  Pasta was ok.  Honey Cake desert was small and not memorable.  The desert was free because they never brought us the fries that should have accompanied the $39 ribs.  This is a first and last time here.  Acceptable but not worth returning.",

As our dinner ended, the power went out, leaving the restaurant dark and VERY HOT. Our waiter came over to say he'd have to do the bills manually which will take awhile. No Manager came to apologize during our 40+ minute wait. We did learn from wait staff that this was the 2nd power outage in recent weeks so you'd think the management would have an idea of how to keep customers happy while sitting in the heat waiting for a bill. Nobody ensuring water glasses stayed full (it's summer in AZ!!!), no offer for a drink from the bar, no offer to comp an appetizer or drink from bill...And while 2 other tables had a \"soon to be\" manager approach them with offer for champagne while they waited, she never offered our table! We were the only 3 tables in that dining room! It was so rude! There were so many opportunities during our long wait for the staff to do the bare minimum and it wasn't done. Once people in our party started approaching the \"soon to be\" manager, she said our drinks would be comped but then we received bill without the comp. The follow up phone call to the GM the following day by our group rep was promising as he gave a contact name and # for refunds but the woman at that # said power outage is the city's fault, not theirs and she would not refund. Our group rep contacted GM again and he eventually offered to mail gift card but due to the HORRIBLE experience, um No I will not be returning, you can keep your gift card.",

From the hostess who greeted us upon our arrival and bent over backwards to accommodate us at a table of our choosing, to our server Corbin, who was delightful, knowledgeable and engaging, every single person on the staff was excellent. We even got a visit from the owner David, who could not have been more friendly or delightful to chat with! We have dined there several times before and have always enjoyed it thoroughly but this particular visit was charmed! All of our food selections were exactly as the menu (and Corbin!) described them and were enjoyed by all of us. Thanks to Ocotillo for making our dinner such a great time and the perfect way to celebrate a special day and a special guy!  I would recommend the Ocotillo highly. There are several  different areas of the restaurant that are suited for different dining experiences. There was even a wedding reception going on in one of the larger outdoor spaces and it looked as if it was accommodated perfectly. From intimate to larger celebrations, the Ocotillo can do it all. It has made it to our \"Favorites\" list and we look forward to going back, again and again!",

If a friend comes from out of town, I usually bring them here because it's so centralized in Phoenix's food scene.   I've tried the Breakfast Burger and the Crispy Pork Belly  Burger was rich, had that egg on top that I like so much. But I'd probably not get it again mainly because the menu is so diverse.  However, the Crispy Pork Belly was absolutely amazing. Imagine a giant slab of Pork Belly slow cooked barely to the point of jello, and then deep fried. The crispiness and tenderness in a giant slab of pork fat is the best thing in the world. Paired with Vietnamese spices such as pickled vegetables, peanuts and hoisin sauce, this is something I would order again.  So great ambiance (especially in the cool spring months) and amazing food makes this te best brunch place in Phoenix in my eyes.  Note: This place is very popular even at Sunday morning. People reserve quite often and there's usually a bridal/baby shower out back. My suggestion is to get a bar seat if you want to skip the reservations.",

It's a sprawling complex of a restaurant that is  unusual for the area.  The food is also good!  I ordered the spinach salad with salmon and the fruit salad.  The fruit salad was good, but a little on the high end price wise for what you got.  The spinach salad was good and filling and it was enough food that I couldn't even finish.  I liked that although it was drenched in dressing, the dressing was so light that it wasn't overwhelming.  Also, the salad had hard boiled eggs in it that were cooked just perfectly.  Not overdone and not underdone.  That's kind of a tough feat for hard boiled eggs, so I liked that.  However, I would have liked it better if instead of just doing spinach, they would have done mixed greens that included spinach.  Eating all that spinach gets a little monotonous after a while.  What I didn't like was that on a Sunday it was very busy and kind of hard to get quick service.  We sat at the bar and felt like we were waiting a lot (to order... to get the bill... you get it).  Also, our server/bartender was a little too jokey.  I don't need every answer to one of my questions to be a joke, you can just... answer my questions.",

    "text": "The food was amazing! Delicious! Everything on the menu sounded superb but I settled on the short rib ravioli and roasted beets, and I ate every last bite. My friend ordered the smoked salmon platter and summer squash, and she ate every bite as well. The only downside came after the dinner when we headed over to the bar. After finishing a couple drinks we both pulled out our credit cards. We went unacknowledged for at least 10-15 minutes while the bartenders either cleaned or conversed with the 2 other patrons at the bar. Finally, our waiter from dinner came over and grabbed our cards and made the bartenders cash us out. He said he saw us sitting there with our cards out for some time. His service was great! The bar- not so much.",

    "text": "Fab \"new\" spot located in Central Phoenix. It does a great job of delivering delicious New American food and providing an open and industrial/modern space. The spot contains a restaurant, cafe and tons of open space like a beer garden, bar and patio.  For the restaurant (menu wise), they serve lunch and dinner. However, they only serve brunch on the weekends.   I came here for lunch with Stacy M to get a little taste of what Ocotillo had to offer and was pleasantly surprised. We ordered their Iced Coffee Boba, filled Dates, Cabbage Salad and a Egg White Breakfast Burrito to share and it was more than enough.  Iced Coffee Boba: I would pass on this as the coffee tastes like any typical iced coffee you can get, however the boba was overly done and mushy instead of having the chewy, bouncy texture it should have. Dates: dates filled with ricotta and topped with almonds and blackberries, this appetizer is deliciously simple and perfect for sharing. No judgement if you don't want to, it's perfectly acceptable because they are that good! Cabbage Salad: this salad is fresh, light and comes is a more than generous portion. It has shaved cabbage, carrot and comes with a lovely tea dressing that adds a tart and fragrant flavor to the salad. The Egg white burrito: was probably the best egg white anything I've ever had, it was so flavorful and clean. This entree surprised me the most. Filling, clean tasting but nothing short of flavorful from the ingredients and house salsa that's served with it.  The cafe is the only cafe in Phoenix that serves Sightglass coffee and has a good arrangement of drinks, snacks and pastries. Although separate from the rest of the restaurant, this area is quiet and perfect for solo coffee/tea drinkers. I've had their Autumn Latte, breakfast burrito (egg and bacon) as well as their Nutella Croissant and it was all so delicious. They definitely take typically made items and add their own twist which is truly refreshing. The price is also a lot cheaper than most other cafes I frequent, which is a definite plus!  The staff here can be a bit slow, but they are all so friendly and easy to talk to. They truly make you feel welcomed and show their appreciation. They are also really receptive to any questions or concerns you may have. Definitely a place to check out!",

I had the pleasure of coming here last Saturday evening and noticed I hadn't been here in over 8 months. ALWAYS sit with Josh if you're able. His attention to detail is exquisite even to the degree that he noticed that my I-Phone wasn't charging and brought out his own charging block along with my wife spilling something minor on her blouse and him taking a minute to go get soda water and a black napkin.    Love the updated menu and beverages. The cauliflower 2.0 is as good if not better than the original.    Huge fan of their pasta but I really loved the new smoked parpadelle solely due to the fact that they went with a chicken rather than a beef ragu. Which helped our decision in my wife being able to order the most AWESOME filet of beef - cooked to perfection.   Finishing up everything with the most incredible awe inspiring desserts, the almond joy & deconstructed cheesecake.    Sincerely looking forward to visiting your sister concept Starlite which Josh spoke highly of and I really admired the story behind the name. Living in Arcadia it'll be directly in between both locations.   Thanks again Ocotillo management and Josh.   We'll be back :)",

Service was on the slow side but I didn't want to dock them points because we came in a big group and they were in a middle of a big rush so it's understandable. It did take them about 30 mins to seat us even with reservations and beverage and food delivery was extremely slow. Our meal took over 3 hours from seating to receiving bill which is way too long.   What was really disappointing was the food. They changed their menu up and this new menu was definitely not what I was expecting or hoping for after seeing all the good reviews about the past menu.   Linguine - noodles were cooked perfect and the texture of the noodles were on point however the sauce was lacking flavor.   Ravioli - cooked perfect, wrapped well and the meat inside was delicious .  Spicy duck - the flavoring on it was really nice however it was severely undercooked inside to the point where the meat wasn't even warm. The outside cooked pieces that I did have taste well.   Smoked salmon- it was good. Nothing out of ordinary, just a good smoked salmon app.   Duck confit salad - tasted good , duck was cooked nice and ingredients tasted fresh.   Beef ribs- nicely seasoned and well cooked .",

The lunch took nearly 60 minutes to arrive.  The food quality was very uneven. My soup was excellent, but my friend's fish and chips order was flavorless and overcooked.  Very, very loud.",

Asked for a side of avocado and when I put it over my eggs it was smothered in lime juice. I informed my waiter and she said it comes like that, asked if I can get another order and was told kitchen is backed up and could take 10 min. Told her never mind since I was already ready to get out of there. Before she brought the check she apologize for her \"crappy service and that she never works brunch\" (her words) before we got the check.",

The environment is spot on, but they could use some outdoor TV's, which would make it a great spot to watch Sunday football.    Looking forward to many visits in the future to try all they have to offer.  One downside, and I totally agree with other reviews, is their drinks.  Even the orange juice was watered down, tasted more like a powdered orange drink rather than \"freshly squeezed\".  Also was shocked to order a simple Patron margarita on the rocks and then to receive a $23 bill for it.  WTF?!?!?  Do they think they are in Manhattan instead of Phoenix?",

    "text": "Seeing how Ocotillo is central to my job and home, I visit here often.  I have had many items from each of the menus. The prices, given the portion sizes, are very fair.  BRUNCH/LUNCH: I recommend the Brisket (OH MY GAWD!), the avocado toast, either quiche, honey chicken sandwich, arugula salad, cauliflower (personal favorite), zucchini (my other personal favorite), farm veggie plate, fish and chips, ricotta/strawberries and grilled bread, pork sausage sandwich  DINNER: Butternut squash pasta!   SPECIAL EVENTS: LAMB! (Hot damn, the lamb!)  Coffee bar: Excellent! The girls in there are friendly, professional, fast and the coffee and tea selection is very nice. It is wonderful to get a break from corporate Starbucks! The universal love is strong in there!   Atmosphere: I typically eat outside. It is just too beautiful of a spot to eat indoors. However, with it being cooler now, I have eaten inside. I find that I can carry a conversation or take care of business whilst waiting for my order. It's clean. It's open.   Service: I am always served and seated in a timely manner. However, I am not there during a lunch or dinner rush. Once, I did not enjoy my sandwich. The salmon was intentionally served cold and I expected it to be served hot. It was taken care of with out a problem. My food has been consistently delicious.   Constructive Criticism: I would love for there to be coat/purse hooks and a baby changing station in the restrooms. No one wants to set anything valuable, such as a fine leather bag or, say, a baby, on a restroom floor.   With all this said, saddens me to see such mixed reviews as I have only had the best of experiences and/or my not so great experiences are always handled with great care. I foresee Ocotillo becoming a much needed gem in this neighborhood. I'd hope that those who have written concerning their less than favorable experiences would return to find themselves receiving top-notch food and service, just as I have.",

Definitely a little hipster, but there is no sense of pretentiousness. Everyone is very nice.  The architecture and layout of the restaurant is very unique in a good way. You can eat in a modern indoor or patio, in an indoor or outdoor bar, lounging on a couch, on the lawn, at the coffee shop or on a picnic table. Crazy part is that it works very well and does not feel disjointed.  Why 4 stars? Minor things. Service could tighten up a bit, and hopefully will with time (still relatively new). Also the proportion of carb to meat on a few of the sammiches is off.",

The place was slightly busy, many parties larger than 6 were seated. The food was good, they only serve brunch on Saturday's, so we tried several pancakes, cinnamon roll, wings, breakfast chimichanga, bacon and also the bacon and egg breakfast BLT. All the food was so good! Definitely no complaints on the food! However it took almost 50 mins to receive our food. And there wasn't a ton of food rolling out into the outdoor seating area so I'm unsure what the hold up was. Our server was friendly enough, however he seemed very rushed and really failed in the beverage department, forgetting drinks the first time and then rarely refilling the soda's and teas. When you sit somewhere for nearly 2 hours and wait almost an hour for food, refills are a must! After the food was served he brought some extra syrup but didn't return to see if everything was okay or if we were in need of anything else. The other servers walking around and helping other tables didn't care about anyone not in their section, the bussers didn't pick up the service slack either. If the service was better Ocotillo would have received 5 stars! However, what a let down for our first experience here!",

    "text": "Ocotillo has made its way to my top 5 list of favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area! The location is awesome I love how it is laid out and the little coffee shop! The DJ was cool too! It was a really fun environment. You could tell it was good because there were so many people there despite almost all of the surrounding roads being closed down due to a parade. Being a vegetarian, usually my choices are somewhat limited which makes it easy to choose what to order. Here I couldn't decide so I ordered like way too much stuff haha but I shared it! Our waitress was in training and I wouldn't have known if she didn't say so because she did great! So all of the things I tried were: iced green tea (I think the guy said tropical green tea?), Nutella iced coffee without boba, stuffed medjool dates, strawberry scone, falafel burger with quinoa, and the carrot fetoosh salad. Everything was absolutely delicious. The tea was very refreshing. I only tried a few sips of the Nutella coffee, and it was yummy! Tasted like a really good mocha. The medjool dates were stuffed with goat cheese and marcona almonds, and we all liked them, they were sweeter than I expected, but I'd love to try to recreate this recipe at home. I usually do not like scones much but I liked this scone a lot, especially the cinnamon ricotta on the side. My main meal the falafel burger was yummy! A little bit dry because of the falafel patty but otherwise fantastic. I really liked the pickled beets on it. I tried one french fry and liked it, but I'm glad I chose the quinoa as my side, it was fresh tasting and light. The carrot fetoosh salad was great as well! I was skeptical of carrot hummus but man I couldn't stop eating it. It was a filling salad too. It was all a tad pricey but entirely worth it! Can't wait to come back.",

They first showed us to the front patio area which felt a little crammed. On my way to the  bathroom, I saw the back patio area with community tables and that had a much better feel. We then asked to be seated in one of their picnic tables -- more spacious, better vibe. There was another couple on the other end of the table but it didn't feel like we were in each other's bubble.   We decided to share the avocado toast and the ribeye. The avocado toast was a little bland, it needed a little bit more salt, I just expected a little more flavor. The ribeye though, it was huge!!! And packed with flavor, it came with hashbrowns and fried egg, arugula and a red wine sauce and wow -- everything together just heaven in your mouth. For that price and that huge steak, I'd definitely come back. I noticed a lot of people ordered the cauliflower, that's something I'd probably try next time.   The reason I docked one star was the service. I felt like I barely saw our waiter, he barely checked on us or refilled my water. Also, he charged my bfs beer wrong, twice. Other than that, it was a perfect Saturday spent! We enjoyed the food, the ambience and the dogs playing around!",

Two things are always consistent; the quality of the food and, sadly, the heightened annoyance of the million flies that also want to enjoy my food and beverage.   Please. For the love of all that is holy in the world of hospitality and restaurant management- please get rid of all the flies (and gnats) in your restaurant.   The last few times I've been in for lunch or beverages after work, I've been unable to enjoy my time save for swatting away flies every few minutes because...gross. In fact, I've even witnessed the boss man/owner take a small air gun out and shoot the flies on the wall. You sir, get all kinds of side eye for that. No, thank you - I will pass on the bear grylls fly appetizer.   The solution lies in your ventilation issues. You don't have enough positive pressure occurring inside your building and your doors are too slow to close; therefore, not only are you letting the pesky buggars in, you're not doing enough to push them out. Your open kitchen concept is probably contributing to this as well - and with as many flies that are in the dining room, i shudder to think what's buzzing around your kitchen.   I can't come back until you've solved this problem. Which really blows, because your cauliflower is some next level madness. Two stars is all I can muster - fix your flys with some traps or a blue light buzzer and I'll be back with 3 more stars in my pocket.",

    "text": "Ocotillo Restaurant is in Downtown Phoenix off of 3rd St and Osborn Rd. The grounds are large and easy to find. The whole space has a really open and airy feel to it. The concept is quite eclectic and different as they have a ton of unique flavor combinations and the menu itself is HUGE. My first visit was a promotional lunch for the app BumbleBFF. The staff had given us a large corner booth table by the window which provided more than enough space for all of us. We could not wait another minute to put in some pitchers of Sangria. They also brought fruit plates which were presented beautifully. I chose the House Smoked Salmon board. I was blown away by the presentation and freshness of the ingredients. The smoked salmon was some of the best I've had. It was paired with capers, tea egg, pickled shallots, dill creme, and perfectly grilled seeded bread. The portion was just what I needed. The waiter was so gracious and took care of us the entire time. I don't think this event would have been nearly as memorable had it been anywhere else. We all left with happy hearts and full belly's. My second visit to Ocotillo was for a family dinner. We put in a couple of appetizers like the Halibut Ceviche and the Grilled Heirloom Squash. Both were tasty and light. Perfect appetizers if you're trying to taste a lot of things on the menu. I am a pasta lover so to say I was excited to try their pasta's is an understatement. I gravitated towards the Baked Lumache Pasta with butternut squash, winter greens, goat cheese, parmesan and bread crumbs. This was so incredibly creamy and rich. Plus the portion was massive. My only complaint was that it had a bit too much sauce, I felt bad wasting so much of it. We were happy we got to try so much on the menu and all agreed the ingredients tasted fresh in every dish.  My most recent visit was for an anniversary brunch. We started off with mimosas and ended up regretting not just doing the pitcher deal for $18 which came out to about 4 mimosas which we ended up having by the end of the meal anyway. This time around I really wanted to try their 'SWEET' section on their menu as it has always caught my eye. We had the Warm Cinnamon Rolls which sits in a warm skillet on a small puddle of maple syrup. The inside lined with Apple Jam and topped with Maple Frosting. I was hesitant about the Sun Dried Strawberries in Balsamigo with herbed ricotta, basil and country bread. It sounded sweet and I was afraid it would be too much. I was wrong as the sweetness was subtle and the herbed ricotta balanced it out. It's a unique flavor combination but it got better with every bite. There wasn't nearly enough bread, just one more piece would have been perfect for the significant amount of spread left over. Lastly, the Fried Chicken sat in a hefty pile of parmesan polenta with a fried egg on top and scallions covered in truffle honey. This visit to Ocotillo was relaxing and we surprised ourselves with our choices but left feeling more than satisfied.

    "text": "We ran it back here & did it right this time! When I say we did it right this time, it's because we knew better & got THREE steaks! Lol  If you're coming here for brunch, GET THE STEAK ($21). I said this in my previous review, and I will reiterate it because I still feel the same way about it. The dish itself comes with a huge steak, a hash brown cake & two eggs. It's very filling, but ridiculously/unbelievably delicious & will leave you very satisfied.  The type of love my cousins & I have for their brunch steak is something else. The steak had us groaning each bite. It had us doing happy eating dances. It had us grinning from cheek to cheek. It had us describing it in words we don't typically use. Yes. Their brunch steak is divine.  So some of you may wonder what else they have on their menu that could possibly be great to pair with such a beautiful brunch steak. Well, brace yourself......... BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS ($18/person).  Fair warning about bottomless mimosas though: You think you're fine & dandy until you stand up & realize.... woah okay..... maybe I had one too many! LOL. But hey!!!! It's cool. Sunday Funday right?!  TIP: Their entire establishment is gorgeous--interior AND exterior. Typically, it's hard to get indoor seating on weekends unless you have reservations. So if you don't want to sit outside, plan ahead & make a reservation. However, if you plan on walking in, the outdoor patio seating is shaded & has fans running through out the day.  FINAL THOUGHTS: this place is a must try/must see! I will always return here when I come to Phoenix..... I promised myself the next time I visit, I'll save room to try the Nutella Iced Coffee boba (as a dessert or a walk away beverage)...... But yes, you read that right. Nutella. Coffee..... BOBA. Praise the Lord.",

Nicole the server may have social issues, as when we asked her one question about a drink she snapped, so odd as people working in the customer service field should have skills that are receptive to working with people! We decided not to order food as we felt a very negative vibe and decided to leave. The worst experience so far in Arizona. All the other restaurants and service have been phenomenal. I hope the manager has a discussion with her as they lost out on a good $100 or more as we order lots of food n drinks normally!  Changed to 3 stars, as the manager did reach out to me & apologized for his rude & unprofessional staff member. I did appreciate that, didn't try the food, so can't rate that but the drinks were good.  & of course we didn't have time nor would we think of something so dumb as to complain, while at the restaurant to call over a manager to make it more awkward, then it was, so that's out of the picture for any idiot who's dumb enough to wonder why I would leave a review and not just ask for a manager. I would never complain about someone and then order food in the same breath, who knows what someone is capable of doing to my food etc., so yes think logically before u comment--",

    "text": "II started with a 4 star rating, but as I listed the attributes of Ocotillo, it has to be five, even for a first visit. The soundtrack was the clincher. This place has it all:  Thoughtful and well-executed menu Focus is on integration of vegetables. I went with the roasted cauliflower as a starter. It's quite different and really good. My salmon main was very nice too with equal parts salad and salmon along with just enough starch. The smoked beet and chevre salad is exceptional.  Attentive service Its the little things that count. Instead of leaving me with my fork and knife from my appetizer, both were removed and replaced with new for my main. I like it best when I'm well informed and visited, but not overly so. Ocotillo does this.  Incredible layout There are multiple sections to Ocotillo. My dining partner said it reminded of a W Hotel. There is an outdoor area with fireplace, lawn and casual seating. I'd describe the inside as upscale industrial. One inside area is more secluded, the other is high--top seating with an open view of the kitchen - yes.  Vibe Efficient. Effective and Relaxed. Combining these attributes is no small feet. It takes thoughtful planning and solid execution. Well done Ocotillo.  Soundtrack Now for the kicker. In 2008 I was cloistered at the Park Hyatt in Tokyo for 36 hours. Jet lagged and depressed, I listened to a continuous loop of electronica / eclectic from a hotel channel. When I say continuous loop, I mean for 36 hours. After I left I could not get this soundtrack out of my head - so killer. The only song I knew was Heroine by Blonde Redhead <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DzVMF6gYbGEE&s=9a860d48733c275160c9ea6da54c6115d0b4ae9b0c7a72b26090375a86fa8837\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=zVMF...</a>. I even contacted the hotel afterward, but they only spoke Japanese so that was useless. This was years ago. The soundtrack at Ocotillo came as close as anything I've heard since. I id'd a bunch of the songs. Very happy about this.",

    "text": "I wanted to have a special dinner with friends who were only in town for one night.  This was NOT the place to take them. Although the outside area is pleasant, our service was terrible.  No one seemed to be able to describe the items on the menu without checking with the chef, and the wait person went so far as to say he wasn't a \"pasta person\" himself so he couldn't recommend any particular pasta dish. When he spilled water all over the table he excused himself by saying it didn't really matter since it was a picnic table.   The \"Small Plates\" are actually tiny for the price.  This would be OK if they were actually good, but the (three) seared scallops were drenched in hot chili's that totally destroyed their subtle flavor while the asparagus with a dressing mix of cream and ramps was old, dry and overpriced.   The rest of the menu was ambitious in its off-the-wall  combination of flavors and ingredients, but less than successful in its actualization.  Just combining foods and spices in an original way does not mean the result is tasty. The kitchen seems to think that quinoa, garlic, ramps, pumpkin, blueberries, blah blah, arugula, blah blah, protein can be thrown together to impress,  just because of  the number of ingredients, no matter how poorly they combine on the palate.    The wine and beer menu was not up to date and the waiter didn't know what was actually currently available until it was ordered.   Aside from that... at least the weather was great.",

    "text": "Thoroughly enjoyed brunch here. Pricier than your average brunch spot, but also better than your average brunch spot. Service was great. Food was delicious and innovative without being obnoxious or over the top. My husband and I shared the blue corn pancake (!!!), the butternut squash quiche, and the pork belly hoisin sauce dish. The brunch cocktails were nothing to write home about, but the coffee from the coffee bar adjacent the restaurant was outstanding. Such a phenomenal experience.",

Tonight my wife and I stopped by for coffee and dessert and the two of us had a great time! We live very far away but stop in every chance we get! Our server tonight was very friendly and diligent as she attended to our needs for caffeine and sweets! The GM was checking with customers and we ended up having a very pleasant conversation with him. We always enjoy Ocotillo and can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "Is Ocotillo cheap? No. Is it well worth it and one of the best restaurants in Phoenix? Yes. It's been awhile since I've come away from a meal with a more content feeling. The atmosphere itself makes Ocotillo a great visit -- a bar, coffee shop and full service restaurant all share the space and create a lively scene. However, the food is the True star of the show. I experienced flavors that I've honestly never tasted before ... and I've eaten my fair share of food. Every menu item was creatively designed and presented like a piece of artwork. My \"must try\" items would be the Ocotillo Chicken, Curried Cauliflower and Spicy Tofu Salad. Although, I'll admit I'm partial to any item that relatively resembles a healthy dish and still manages to taste incredible (that's much more impressive to me than taking a bunch of junk food and making it tasty). If you go, two tips for you: try to make a reservation and prepare for much larger portion sizes than you would expect for a fancier restaurant. Now, what are you waiting for? Get yourself to Ocotillo.",

    "text": "Perhaps a busy Saturday for lunch is not the best time to visit this place. They only have a brunch menu which is limited. We got a nice table on the patio, but our server seemed distracted. We ordered a salad to split to start. My husband ordered a burger cooked medium, and I got the falafel sandwich. The salad and his burger came together. There was no extra plate to help with splitting the salad. Our server didn't come back to check, so we couldn't ask him. My husband's burger was very dry and cooked well done. My sandwich showed up about 10 minutes later and was also very dry. Our water glasses were never refilled. We did order wine and it took awhile but was OK. After our pleasant 1st visit, this one was disappointing.",

This is a great venue and quite popular based on the crowd.  Enjoyed sitting in the patio where I could interact with nature.  Also got to eavesdrop on a very boring conversation from the only couple who have ever had a child. Lol. Cheers! $18 bottle mimosas, yum.",

    "text": "This place looks impressive as you walk in. The ambiance is nice and welcoming. We were promptly greeted and sat. Our server was friendly and quick. Food came out shortly. I had the ribeye with eggs and potato cake. The potatoes were a bit bland and under seasoned; the eggs were cooked just right. The ribeye, the star of the plate, however, was highly over salted and over cooked. We also ordered the brisket, polenta and eggs which were just ok. A little on the fatty side and tough, also a little salty. The polenta was good but the jus on the plate broke down the creaminess. Lastly we had the pound cake which tasted good but was fairly dry.   Overall, a lot of nearly good items. I'd be willing to try again with different items, but my expectations will be set a bit lower. This place has potential to be awesome!",
