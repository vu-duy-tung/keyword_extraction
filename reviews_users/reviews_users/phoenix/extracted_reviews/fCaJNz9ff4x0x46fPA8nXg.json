The meals don't come with hummus or any other sauces. The quantity of rice was substantial but maybe just to make it look like more food than you actually receive. The falafels were also extremely dry and bland. I won't be returning.",

    "text": "Delicious.  Visited on a Friday evening.  Ordered the chicken kebab pita combo with a side of the tzaziki.  First, fries were coated with a dusting of some seasoning that leaves the fries crunchy, they were warm and soft on the inside.  The combo also came with a large drink, so I opted for the raspberry tea.  Now, the star of the show was the chicken.  Large chunks of perfectly spiced chicken.  It had lime flavors and that char on the outside.  The garlic sauce was a little runny and the onion was large but the tomatoe was fresh tasting and thin.  The pita was soft and the tzakiki sauce was not strong and had little chunks of cucumber, smooth yogurt sauce.  I will definitely come again and probably order the same thing.  I saw a few people come in and pick up, like they had ordered to go which I think would be a great idea for a weekday dinner.  Big portions and worth the $10.  I sat outside because it was a nice weather night and we like to people watch!!",

Score! This always excites me because a lot of these places serve fries but no ranch...anyway. the place is clean and the servers are nice. I was apparently confused when I was ordering because I almost ordered some plate with a bunch of meat...thankfully they explained what I was ordering before I paid so I could change my order..situation avoided.

It was ok not great but not horrible either the meat was soft the Pita was soft witch are good things, Now as far as The Tzatziki Sauce it was one of the worst I've had. No flavor it tasted and looked watered down. Looked like a watered down Ranch Dressing. I doubt if I'll ever go back again..Unless I'm really craving a Gyro and happen to be near there most likely I wont go back.",

I can't explain it, they are the perfect size, the perfect amount of crunchy but soft and were cooked in the perfect amount of oil. No shoestring gross, oily fries here!!!

That came with rice, pita, Greek salad and garlic sauce. I also got and appetizer order of falafel. The falafel was some of the best I've had. It was nice and crispy outside and spicy and moist inside. The schwarmra was also wonderful and the salad and rice that accompanied it were good too. Prices were also really good. When I find myself in Phoenix again I would definitely go back.",

Price was about $6.50 for a pita sandwich  (combo was $2.25 more). I chose the Chicken Kabob pita which is the best one if you prefer chicken breast like myself. It is a tasty pita stuffed with about 10 long strips of nicely marinated chicken (lemon, spices) and then onions, tomatoes and I chose Greek style which is feta and tziiki sauce. The chicken was freshly grilled as I listened and the sandwich was a quick eat, fairly healthy and good flavors as well.",

I arrived about 45 minutes before they closed and was asked what I want. I ordered the #1, a gyro with fries. The cashier told me not to throw any garbage away in the garbage cans because the bags cost three dollars a piece. 'Wow, this business is getting really ripped off on garbage bags' was the first thing I thought.  The food came out quickly and the pita was okay, if a bit sloppy. The tomatoes were strangely cut as well, like huge quarter-cuts. The fries were goddamn miserable. Half of them were still frozen. I later figured out it was because they wanted us to get the hell out, as I turned around right after walking outside and they locked the door on us, and refused to let me refill my drink.  The real shame was having to walk into the new Tom Cruise snoozer 'Oblivion' with those horrific frozen fries firmly mashed into my teeth.   Thanks for a good time Greek Pita!",

I go here weekly to grab lunch during work - I have yet to be disappointed. The chicken is always flavorful and I've never found it to be dry. The gyro is also on point and is served extremely fast!  In terms of price, if you get a plate combo then you can expect to pay about $12-$13.... But you get A LOT of food. It comes with tons of rice, pita with dipping sauce, a side salad, and a generous amount of whatever meat option your heart desires. I always have to take leftovers home when I order a plate. IMO, definitely not expensive considering all that you get.  Alternatively, you can get a value meal which consists of a pita sandwich with fries and a drink - typically about $10. The pita sandwich is nicely stuffed so I also can't complain about the price for those. Also, their fries are awesome - nothing special, just perfectly crisp on the outside and thick and \"meaty\" inside. Mmmm.  The only thing I would probably pass on are the salad entrees, just because I feel that there's almost TOO much vinaigrette on them. I tend to like my salads dry though, so I might just be an oddball in that regard.",

    "text": "I went to Greek Pita without doing a Yelp check.  Came out of the movies, saw the place and thought that spanokopita (spinach pie) would be a great snack before going to bed.  A spinach pie.  What could be bad about that?  Took an appetizer portion to go and drove home anxiously awaiting that delicious pie.  Opened the container and saw a bed of lettuce under it--nice, I thought. Then I made one mistake.  I lifted the spinach pie.  And there is was--- a pool of grease not only on the lettuce but on the entire bottom of the spinach pie.  It was shiny from the grease and four paper towels DID NOT absorb all of the grease on this unworthy pie.   So after shocking my husband with a view of this greasy mess, he shook his head and said:  You're not going to eat that are you?  I told him that I had to take a bite in order to do an accurate Yelp review.  He watched me to make sure it was only one bite.  After all, he didn't want to have to drive me to the hospital if I got sick or on a lighter note, have to get up from bed to get me the Pepto-bismol.  So I tasted it. It was not bad, but it was not good.  Not enough feta cheese and did I taste a bit of mozzarella in there?  That's not the Greek way of making it.  I know. I make it.  So my laziness of not making a tray of spanokopita led me to craving it and ending up with something my own kitchen would not produce.  Ever.   So I give the spanokopita one star for the price.  A total of $2.44 with the tax.  BTW, after the bite taken on behalf of Yelp, the kitchen disposal totally enjoyed it.  GRRRRRRRRRRRRR.... I heard the disposal say----Is it mad at me??????",

I went in today after, I guess it's just a name change, and it didn't taste as awesome as it usually does and I asked for the two meat combo chicken and steak and the chicken was not what I normally get (shawarma but what I got was not strips it was chunks) and tasted a bit tangy not really what I wanted. The steak was still good and flavorful. I always dip it into the garlic sauce. This time though I got hummus and I never got that before I guess now it comes with the meal. I took off a star because my meal with a drink was like $17 waayyy to much. So I do recommend this place however I suggest you eat there or outside while the food is fresh. The quality suffers if you wait a while to eat it.",

Maybe this is how you act in Greece, but it's not how we like it in the USA.  The pita they serve was exactly like the store bought pita you can buy from costco. The meat was okay.

I checked out the menu and the pitas here looked legit, so I walked in to try out some pita sandwiches.  The menu is varied and the main meats they have are chicken (dark and white meat), gyro meat, kafta kabob (Ground meat kabob), battered fish, and they also have falafel as a vegetarian option. They offer plates, pita sandwiches, and combination deals which include a sandwich, drink, and fries.  I went with the #10: A marinated chicken breast pita with tomatoes, onions, and lettuce. You have your choice of garlic or Greek sauce- I went with the garlic. It was delivered in a short amount of time and looked and smelled amazing. It was served with a mountain of fries. It tasted excellent. The cool vegetables went well with the marinated, grilled chicken and the garlic sauce meshed well with the rest of the sandwich. The chicken itself was perfectly seasoned, and tender. The only slight negative was that the onions were all piled in one area of the pita, so there were a few bites were all I was biting into was pita bread and onion.   Service was friendly, and while the restaurant is small they manage to pack quite a few booths and 2-seater tables into the area. There is also a limited amount of outdoor seating.   While the interior smells great from all the grilled food, your clothes might smell of grilled Greek style meats for a bit if you dine in.  I'll definitely come here again for their excellent Greek food.",

    "text": "I was so surprised to find such a great little Greek restaurant in this setting after going to the movie.  I mentioned it to my friend that I was surprised to see ethnic people running an ethnic restaurant in a mall type of place.  It is pretty apparent that this little restaurant is family owned and operated and for Greek food this is the only way to go.  Everything, in my opinion was excellent.   The gyro was of a flavor that couldn't have been better and the way it was served met that.  My friend has a salad that to me met the standards a person should be looking for if they want what it was called-a Greek salad.  It would be nice if there had been a bazuki player but for a mall sort of setting, one can only ask so much, right?  This restaurant is not near my home, but I know the next time I go to see a movie, I probably will drive to Tempe just so I can eat at It's all Greek to Me afterward.",

From the meat to the pita to the tzatzki sauce. And you get a nice overflowing portion of meat in the gyro. Fries on the side are also great. Theres nothing lamer then getting awful, chewy or cold or the numerous things that can go wrong with fries. And lastly not over priced. Not dirt cheap either, but fair. Great spot for some good greek.",

Well I have described it's all Greek to me as the Greek version of fast food, don't get me wrong the food is great otherwise we wouldn't bother to return!... however our hang-up in the past had been their customer service. There was a chick working there that seriously made me not want to EVER go back, she was a nightmare lol  Got our order completely messed up, even after I suspected she would and reiterated my order to her and asked her if she got it?? Well she lied and said she did but didn't give a flying-fudge about MY wants and needs and placed an order for something random hahaha I mean it was still good, I ate it haha but it's the principle of the matter! Well lucky for us little people she no longer works there, as far as I've seen? And everything has been great. Good seating, they have a great customizable coca-cola soda fountain, great portions, great flavor!! Love having the option to sit outside so my pup (wuzzy) can kick it with us lol",

For quick Greek in the valley, they are my favorite. I always pick up a box of baklava by the register. Parking is dicey when the shops are in full swing but I have my partner drop me off while I run in and he circles. I happen to love the music they play. Its upbeat and current. Check it out!

You can't really see the menu from the side of the counter where you order, but as soon as I walked up to the counter a girl came out, very helpful to help me order. I got the gyro plate which comes with the original gyro meat, Pita bread, rice & a Greek salad.  My food was ready so fast, like 5 minutes!  I took my food to go since I live right around the corner.  I got home and opened my food... Wow! Definitely enough food for two!! The meat was a little salty but balanced out with lots of tyziki sauce, some of the meat seemed a little dry. The rice was light and delicious. The salad was amazing and the feta tasted very fresh. I only wish they would have included veggies (tomato, cucumber, lettuce) for the pita as the pita is basically only pita bread, meat & sauce. I would come here again!",

At this place they gave us two types of pita; the normal thin warm pita I'm used to dipping into hummus and then another very thick piece that was also great.  I've never had anything like that but it was good.  I know it has a name because it came on a different plate.  The Greek salad was very Greek.  Lot's of lemon which is the way we like it.  Here was the best part for us...next to the cash register they have what appears to be home made baklava.  It was amazing.  Nice and crisp with plenty of honey.  Check it out folks, especially if you're waiting for a movie at the Tempe Marketplace.",

They tasted pretty standard (don't get me wrong, they were quite tasty), but it was the texture that surprised me.  Lightly crunchy on the outside, but fluffy and LIGHTER THAN AIR on the inside.  I can't even find words to describe beyond that.   I loooooved them and look forward to trying their shawarma next time.",

You'll get a lot less many places for a lot more.  Every item on the menu is in picture form and described on the big wall over the open-to-view cooking area, so you see what you get, figuratively and literally.

Well I was certainly surprised by the strange tasting meat....it lead to the worst case of food poisoning I had ever had.   Imagine being in pain from surgery and not being able to keep anything down for two days. Imagine literally projectile vomiting for two days all because a business decided to be lazy. Imagine you have been here before and liked the place. Imagine you now have an aversion so strong to Greek food from one experience that you question if you will ever eat no more. Wonder no more! Just try eating here and play the food lottery to see what you may get.  I will be telling every soul that asks me about this place to avoid like the plague.

I love the tzatziki sauce and the pink garlic sauce, but the oil they put on the hummus and the oily salad dressing are just a little too much with the oily meet. It's heavy comfort food, so if you're wanting something light, stick to a salad with dressing on the side. *insert Greece/grease joke here*  The outdoor seating is really nice, especially because it can get warm inside with the grill.

The family who owned the place chased us through the Tempe Market place demanding we eat our food but we really thought we would die. So, hey, if you had a good meal here, post away. We did not.

My to go dishes are the \"Herculean Hummus\" or the plates. Super savory!  Sometimes it gets very crowded so you have to be little bit patient.  Very clean and friendly staff!

Reasonable prices and hefty servings- like any Greek family would do. Check it out if you want a classic Greek \"street\" food experience.",

    "text": "I didn't search for this place, but rather just stumbled upon it while checking out Tempe Marketplace for the first time. Upon entering, everyone was friendly and they greeted me. All of the employees were in conversation with someone they knew who was visiting, and it looked like they were wrapping it up because I entered. I didn't mind them talking because it gave me time to look at the menu which is about 5 digital screens full of menu items. There were regular gyros (wrapped with pita), and they had all kinds of plates. Honestly, there were so many items, it took me a little while to see what they had. Luckily, I was the only customer in line at the time. It probably would be uncomfortable on a busy day. Check out the menu before you go if this is your first time.   I ended up getting the Herculean which is a big plate of homemade hummus topped with slices of meat. They had several choices for gyro meat; I just picked the regular one most people are used to. The hummus looked a little different than what I'm used to. I'm used a golden color and having kind of a runny mashed potato texture. This one was a light off-white color, more tan than white. The consistency was more like a thick sauce. Nevertheless, it was delicious. They included two big pita bread on a separate plate. The meat gyro was very tasty. It had a slight crisp exterior, but overall it was soft. It was moist, salty, and delicious.   It was a big plate with a big amount of food. Although, it's something I would probably expect for around $12. I was so full for more than a few hours.   I can't wait to come back and try the other menu items. I think I will try a familiar wrap next time with some veggies!",

While the nearly $9 dollars I spent on a Shawarma combo isn't too outrageous, the size of the pita is pretty small, and for a couple more dollars there are several quality Middle Eastern and Greek places close to Tempe Marketplace that are considerably better. There are also many quicker, cheaper, and better options inside The District.   The Shawarma Pita contained well marinated and cooked chicken thighs, fresh veggies, and an awesome sauce. Disappointingly small for the price, but actually the perfect size for a filling sandwich. The fries are mediocre. I'd suggest skipping them and just going for the sandwich (this will save a little bit of coin, too). Paying a little more for quality doesn't bother me, but I can't say this was worth it.  I only decided to check out The Greek Pita because I was already at Tempe Marketplace, and had never eaten there. If you happen to be there and have a craving for Mediterranean food, then by all means give it a try. But The Greek Pita is definitely not a destination eating spot.",

If you're already out at the Tempe Marketplace, however, this is a suitable dining option.  The food is cooked fresh so do expect to wait a few minutes, especially if there is a line.",

I always get the chicken shawarma plate; it's Greek heaven in every bite. It comes with hummus, a side salad, pita bread and rice. Also, don't forget to request the pink garlic sauce, it's beyond amazing. The staff is really nice and welcoming, and the prices are definitely worth the value and taste! Also their Gyro pita is very delicious; feels like you're ordering one in NYC. It's also one of their lunch special items.",

The falafel here is unique and made with fried garbanzo instead of chickpeas. They fry it well done and it taste is unbelievable. One of my favorite falafels I've ever had. 5 stars.",

    "text": "Ok food, rude employee. Went once to meet a friend who was hungry. I had already eaten and felt that I was too full to order. The worker at the register made fun of me and passive-aggressively told me to order. I didn't think much of it and just laughed it off and told him I already ate. We sat down and I forgot about it until we got up to leave and as we were walking out, the same douchebag came out to the register again and yelled for me to order next time (jokingly HAHA.) I just left feeling annoyed and it made me not want to come back and give them my money.",

    "text": "Very mediocre food for the price. The portion sizes are decent but not really worth it. We had the hummus with chicken shawarma and pita bread. The pita was good (hence the 2 stars), the hummus was average but not bad. It was the shawarma that ruined it all.  First of all it was not sliced the way shawarma should be, it was just large chunks of meat. Secondly it was thigh meat and barely cooked. It had that horrible gamey poultry flavor and that weird soft bite of undercooked meat. Maybe we just got a bad batch. I will give them the benefit of the doubt but would I ever get chicken shawarma from here again? Nope",

My favorite order is the chicken kabob wrap with extra garlic sauce on the side for the fries. In my experience, my order has always been right, the meat is always tender, and the staff is super helpful. Portions are a good size, and there's a lot of selection in the menu. It's good for take out as well! I find that it's money always well spent to go. Not to mention it's the only location, so support local!",

    "text": "The food is totally not worth the price they are charging. We ordered a gyro meat wrap combo and the steak shawarma plate. The gyro meat and fries were pretty decent hence the  2 stars, however the steak shawarma was terrible!! Firstly the cut of the meat was no where close to how shawarma is cut. It was just huge chunks of steak meat overly marinated in some citrusy flavor (i'm guessing vinegar - not sure though). The hummus was salty and there was an overpowering flavor of tahini. Not sure if this is how the Greek shawarma & hummus taste but we did not enjoy it at all. We could barely get past two bites of this plate. We were just glad we had the gyro meat wrap too which was edible. There are much better places out there serving similar cuisine. I probably would not go back here.",
