The food came out very slow and the service staff was horrible. At an average of $30 a plate you expect the service and the Food to be top notch. I have had better service from Denny's. The majority of our plates were average at best. We will never be back!",

    "text": "C'mon folks, I mean you all that gave Marcellinos five stars.  This is what I found on my second trip there in three years.  You simply can not make up for the substandard value on the Lobster special I had with some music and atmosphere.  Wait staff kept calling the Lobster one half of one and a half pounds.  Cut to the chase and call it three quarters of a pound, which turned out to be two oz's of meat and 10 oz's of shell.  Home made pasta was good, sauces good, main waiter, inattentive and confusing.  For $600, I expect to be treated like we are getting ready to spend $600, (six of us).  Here is what you do with party of six: split your party into two tables so you will not be dinged for the automatic 20% tip.  Wait staff must think, HO HUM, we are going to get our 20, work for it or not.  Salad was only fair, appetizers over priced.  I have been making Cannelloni at home since 1974 that blows all the minds that have eaten it. I don't think I have ever heard anyone talk about dining out like they have reacted to sitting at my table for Cannelloni and Cesar salad.  Cesar salad by the way matched by only two restaurants in 50 years of dinning out.",

We have visited twice now and each time have walked away shaking our heads- the first time it was because- \"Why haven't we tried this place before?\" And the second time- \"We didn't think they could top that first visit but they sure did!!\" Both times we've visited, we ordered from their handmade pasta specials. Totally worth it!! We also had the buffalo mozzarella appetizer- so fresh and delicious. To cap off our wonderful evenings there, we've indulged in the chocolate espresso dessert- absolutely decadent; and the tiramisu- very yummy. Chef Marcellino, Sima and their staff are the best.",

I have to say this was some of the best Italian food we've had in a long time. To make it even better, our waiter Charles was fantastic. He even suggested my husband order half-orders of the special pasta and another selection from the menu.  Both were outstanding.  I had the special lamb ragu with pasta. Delicious!  As for the apple pastry with gelato, my husband finished it before I could get two bites. Exceptional meal and superior service.  Be sure to ask for Charles.",

To be honest, I read it and nothing really jumped out at me, but we were hungry and decided to try it out anyway.  Everything changed after our waiter brought out the platter of that day's made in house pasta specials. There were about ten different dishes, and every single one sounded fantastic!  I got a pasta dish with sundried tomato noodles, scallops and shrimp in a spicy red sauce. It was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had!  My husband loved his pasta as well. Definitely a very pricey meal, but it was one that we walked out feeling okay about because it was so good.",

The atmosphere was beautiful and inviting, and the staff were all very friendly. Admittedly, the prices are expensive, but what attracted me to the restaurant was the hand crafted pasta. My favorite food is Italian, so I had to try Marcellino's! The chef even greeted our table at the end of the meal and was a great host. Another surprising part was the dessert. It is served with a flaming sugar cube that gives an extra little detail to a delicious end of meal. I ordered the tiramisu which was to die for.

I unfortunately didn't try the pasta but it is all handmade (I misunderstood the waiter and got what he recommended which was a light white fish, with mashed potatoes, zucchini and carrots) it was good but I wish I would have gotten some pasta just to try it. I also got the Insalata Tre Colori which was a Radicchio, endive and arugola with lemon dressing. The salad was okay, lacked a lot of flavor. It tasted slightly dirty but was decent (I probably wouldn't get that salad again). The wine selection is great. The one bus lady had a huge attitude and was rude (maybe she was having a bad day). I would try this place just one more time but go for the pasta this time.",

They had to have what seemed like at least 20 different pasta varieties at this place all with a plethora of meats, veggies, spices, and different sauces. The dim lighting, white tablecloths and red brick made for perfect decor for a romantic evening.  Back to the food - it was amazing. Lots of umami going on. OK, I don't know I just wanted to throw umami into a review at least once. What the hell is umami again? Anyway, the pasta just kind of melted in your mouth with all of the sauces/butter/whatever else cooking magic they performed in the kitchen.  Tiramisu was also delicious and a good size.  Know this place can be pretty pricey - they bring out a tray of pastas that aren't on the menu that of course sound delicious in the hopes that you will order one of those instead of the menu pastas that are 10-20 dollars cheaper.  With a bottle of wine/dessert/appetizer your  looking at $$$$ here.  I did get black truffle on my pasta though so I suppose you do get what you pay for. Mmmmm black truffle - that's umami right?",

I was first encouraged by the menu and the appearance of some toast and pepper taponade which was very good.  My next course, arugula, olive and greens salad was nicely dressed but with only 3-4 promised fava beans.  I was then presented some pasta courses to choose from (no prices were offered - which I think is in poor taste - but I expected comparable pricing to the ones on the menu) and chose a porcini mushroom and lobster ravioli.  The pasta was also excellent, the mushrooms good but only moderately flavorful and the lobster tasted as if it had been thawed and boiled, clearly overcooked and not fresh.  I mentioned this to my waiter who was helpful and indicated that the chef was making rounds of the tables and I asked him to send him by.  Unfortunately his wife appeared, tasted the lobster, offered to cook me more, sniffed and vanished.  I was billed $39 for this al la carte pasta dish.  The reason for the poor review, thus, was mainly the attitude of the owner, as if rubber flavorless crustacians were the height of italian cuisine.    Enough said.  BTW my next door table mates had the same entree and similar comments.",

We went on a Wednesday night at 6:30, and we were the ONLY ones for the entire time!  Kinda odd, to me, for having so many great reviews.  The pastas were great.  We shared an appetizer: the buffalo mozzarella wrapped with prosciutto and with basil and tomatoes.  That was pretty darn tasty.  Pretty much a caprese with prosciutto wrapped around the cheese.  My hubby got the gnocchi, which was SO good.  I don't like gnocchi, but THIS gnocchi I loved!  It wasn't heavy like others I have tried, it was light and fluffy and perfectly chewy.  I had the shrimp and linguine.  It was delicious as well.  Maybe lacking a bit in salt.  It was a lot of food so I took some home for left overs.  The ambience was alright.  It's strange it's in a strip mall.  But it was cutely decorated and dim.  Not quite sure if we'd go again, but it was fun to try.",

I enjoyed my handmade ravioli with spinach and yummy cheese (not fish yay!) filling and the wine and the mouse.  It was good!!   But then something happened....my date gave the server his card to pay for the meal and it was brought back as not able to be processed (yikes!).  The server also informed him that they'd been able to process someone else's but one other didn't go through.  My date checked his account on line and it had plenty to cover, but had just enough cash to cover the tab, not really enough for a tip.  So he asked the server if they would try to put a lesser amount on the card to cover the tip and take the cash.  This is when the server informed us that the machine might be down and it wasn't just his it was everyone's! So he kinda lied earlier, which wasn't cool.  We then waited another 30 minutes without an appearance by the server to explain what was going on, although I could see Marcellino working on the machine, even trying his own card.  My date got up to go speak with him, and the server tried to divert him, but he was respectful and wanted to speak with the owner.  No attempt was made to really apologize for the delay or make up for the wait...so they wrote down his information and address to mail him a receipt.  Then, the next day, he checked his account and he'd been charged twice!! :( sad, because I thought I might like to go back at some point.",

I had the ground steak gnocchi, which was cooked to perfection.  Both were simply delicious.  They had a very nice wine selection (we had the prosecco), and the espresso which topped the evening off was again, perfect.  This is definitely on my short list of the best restaurants in Phoenix.",

    "text": "I hate to rain on everyone's 5 stars parade but... We had a late dinner.  One of us had the gnocchi Sorrentina, one had the Scialatielli alle Vongole (clams).  Followed by a shared ricotta cheesecake and a cappuccino. We both agreed that their handmade pasta was among the best we've ever had.  The gnocchi was particularly light and tasty. But... - If you've ever bought freshly made pasta at a farmer's market, and cook it at home al dante, the results is not that different. - The fresh bread was cold, borderline stale. - The famous spread for the bread was good, but nothing to write home about. - The Italian cheesecake with ricotta was very good, but not quite what you get in Italy or even a good NY restaurant. - Otherwise the cappuccino was exceptional, world-class, no exaggeration. - Service was very good although the waiter could have been Parisian... probably from Rome though.   Now you may think those comments are a little harsh.  Not really given the tab of $77.    Perhaps if we had come with a bigger appetite and tripled the bill, we would have had a better experience.   But I don't think I'm willing to take that kind of risk.",

The servers posses an almost encyclopedic knowledge of their food offerings.  The ambiance is very nice, who knew it was in a strip mall?  My experiences are from 2006, so I'm a little late to the review table, but I had to throw my 2 cents in.

I only eat pasta that is made fresh and in house, and I can 100% say this place is overpriced basic bitch pasta. The texture of the squid ink pasta was largely unimpressive, it could have been grocery store linguine. I ordered the squid ink pasta not for the novelty (I've had it before) but for the seafood preparation that went along with it, as they have a rigid pasta regimen. It had lobster and calamari with it.  The seafood was perfectly cooked, but unfortunately the chef refused to make a different sauce to go with pasta.   Typically, I would be ok with that, that is.. if the dish is going to blow my mind. But..if I'm being honest, the regular old red sauce tasted like Classico straight off the shelf of my local Safeway.  I'm not sure what the stink was with regard to not switching up the sauce...it might have saved the mundane texture of the pasta.   I'm not sure if maybe the other pastas actually taste like fresh, made in-house pasta? this tasted like maybe it was made a week or two prior..fresh pasta should be soft but al dente with just the right amount of silky chewiness. this pasta was a bit too dense and hard for me believe it is made daily in house. If it is, I am content to know that I can get the same dish by just hitting up bucca di Beppo for less money. And they'll probably make it with the sauce I want.   Won't be going back to this place! Hoping to find a better local joint for good, fresh made pasta.",

    "text": "I only wish that Yelp allowed you to give you negative stars after eating at this dreadful restaurant. It is, by far, the worst Italian restaurant I've ever eaten at. Don't go here unless you like paying a ridiculous amount of money for a ridiculously small amount of bad food. And to top it off, the only thing that will match your tasteless food will be the horrible service you get.   The Food   Simply put, it's terrible. We're an Italian family that has eaten great Italian food from coast to coast and this is, by far, the worst we've ever had. All told, we had one appetizer and three different entrees and it was all tasteless. Virtually no flavor at all. Don't be fooled by something sounding good in the description on the menu if you are unfortunate enough to go here because it probably won't taste anything like it sounds. In fact, it may not have any taste at all. Our food was bland and not cooked properly. The chicken and steak were rubbery, the pasta undercooked and the shellfish chewy. The only good thing about the food is that the portions are so pathetically small that you won't have to suffer through eating it for too long and you will have plenty of room left in your stomach to go eat at a real restaurant after you leave here if you haven't maxed your credit card paying the bill. BTW, if you want to pay $15 for a piece of chocolate espresso cake about the size of a small cupcake this is the place for you.    The Service   Even worse than the food, if that is possible. We had to basically demand some bread because we were extremely hungry and we were told that they usually don't bring bread until after you order. We had to tell them to bring the bread three times and when they did there was no butter. That took another five minutes and it was hard as a rock when it showed up. Don't get too excited though....the bread is a half step up from Wonder Bread straight out of the supermarket. OK, that's not fair...Wonder Bread has more flavor. They pressure you to order, try to get the plates off the table as soon as you put your fork down and clearly want to get you in and out of there as fast as possible so the next poor sap can get your table and get robbed without a gun for a little portion of terrible food.   But Wait, There's More...CHECK YOUR CHECK!  As if overpaying for tiny portions of the crappiest, most tasteless Italian food you've ever eaten with horrendous service isn't enough, here comes the icing on the cake. They have the unmitigated gall to AUTOMATICALLY ADD A 20% GRATUITY TO YOUR BILL! And we were only 4 people, not a large party where this is sometimes done. It is straight up offensive but it might explain why the service is so bad because they know they are slamming you with a 20% gratuity so they probably couldn't care less. If you complain to them about it they will remove the forced gratuity which is somewhat like a pickpocket giving you back your wallet when you catch them counting your money.   Let me make this easy. DO NOT EAT AT THIS AWFUL EXCUSE FOR A RESTAURANT. But, if you have a bitter enemy that you absolutely despise and need to get some kind of revenge on, tell them to eat at this horrific establishment and sleep soundly knowing that you have gotten the last laugh.",

Our waiter was very good about keeping all of our orders separate, and he was even able to prepare separate checks for each person in the party.  Excellent service. Restaurant was very dark, but from what I could see seemed to be nicely decorated.  It was not too noisy.  I had the Strozzaprete ai Broccoli di Rape.  The pasta was supposed to be two colors, but I had trouble seeing it in the dim dining room.  Although I couldn't see my food, I could taste it, and it did taste delicious!  The noodles were perfectly cooked and nicely chewy.  However, $22.95 seemed like a LOT of money for a bowl of pasta.",

    "text": "Overpriced entrees, underwhelming food. My wife and I made a trip to Scottsdale to enjoy some warm weather and down time this spring. We wanted a good meal for our last night and were encouraged to read some of the reviews of this place. Owned by Italians, homemade pastas -- sounded right up our alley. Unfortunately, we were significantly disappointed. We both had pasta specials (I had the parpadelle w/ lamb ragu and she had the squid ink pasta w/ half a lobster, clams and mussels). I'm not one to complain about prices but I do have a problem with places charging big prices only to severely miss the mark on flavor. The parpadelle and squid ink pasta were $40 and $50 respectively. The parpadelle is a dish that even the swankiest restaurants in NYC charge $20 at most for. The squid ink claimed to have \"1/2 of a whole lobster\" but we could only find a few bits of overcooked tail in it. Skimping on the lobster left a terrible impression with me and led me to believe that they're pulling a fast one on us. This feeling was further validated after the waiter came by to inform us that he asked the chef to remove the meat from the shell so \"the lady wouldn't have to get her hands dirty.\" When the dish came, we were shocked when we didn't find an ounce of claw meat in the dish.   Finally, but most importantly, the flavor. The parpadelle was decent but the \"fresh, homemade pasta\" was way too thick. About twice the thickness that I've ever eaten (in even the crappiest of places). The thickness of the pasta coupled with the fact that it did not seem like they ever finished the noodles in the sauce left both dishes very unbalanced. Heavy on the pasta -- even though they had a heavy handed approach to the sauce.  Aside from the pastas, we had the cheesecake and gelato - both of which were more disappointing than the pastas.   The cherry on the top? The cheesy lounge singing performer at dinner. Really? Am I in a vegas lounge? Save the money and your palette. I'm sure there are other excellent places in Scottsdale -- I was only hoping Marcellino's was one of them. Unfortunately, it wasn't and the only folks benefitting are the owners that should be ashamed of the dishes they're putting out there.",

However, one seldom finds as complete a package as Marcellino. The combination of ambience, charming decor, impeccable service, and flavorful dishes makes this an excellent choice if you are bringing a date or celebarting a special occasion. Try the homemade pasta, trust me it is to die for. They also have a version of chicken saltimboca (can't remember the menu name) that is heavenly. If you dine al fresco, you might get some live music blaring from Tapas Papa Frita, which is either a plus or minus depending on your threshold for music volume. Prices are somewhat high, but is within the expected range for a classy Scottsdale establishment. One downside is that I would not recommend the mussels appetizer as the mussels are tiny. The desserts are homemade and decent although not something I would write home about. Truly the main course is the crown jewel of this establishment's menu, but don't get me wrong - the appetizers and desserts (that we tried) are fine, just not up to the standard of the rest of the restaurant.",

The desert was a just-right tiramisu - capping a delectable meal. Yes, it's a bit pricey - but TOTALLY worth it for special occasion food.

I've chosen \"dressy\" and \"not\" good for kids, only based on how we like to experience Marcellino's, though they are so welcoming and comfortable I'm sure casual dress and (well behaved!) kids would be just as welcome... if you tend to spoil your kids, that is.",

We opted for the Monday night three course chefs special with the wine paring.  There was a bit of mixup as the Internet price ($49 p/p) did not reflecrt the price increase after their move to the new location.  However after a short  discussion, the Internet price was honored.   After the complimentary bruchetta, our first wine was presented to us - a lovely chianti blend that introduced our first course.  The first course had two very different offerings.  A wonderful mushroom sauce was served over Polenta - this was my favorite.  The other offering in the first course was traditional Insalata Caprese - mozzarella, local tomatoes and basil.  Both of these dishes were perfect. The second course was preceded by a local Tuscany red wine that was a blend of 4 grapes.  This pasta course was highlighted by a delicious white seven cheese ravioli complimented with a red sausage and marinara  pasta dish.  All of their pastas are home made and were cooked to perfection.  The ravioli was my favorite!  The main course consisted of two fillets of a Mediterranean fish that was a member of the Monk fish family.  It was served with a yummy garlic sauce and accented by perfectly mashed white potatoes dressed with fresh Basil.   The evening was romantic and the service was just right.  We had a wonderful dining experience in this Anniversary stopover in Scottsdale.",

I've always assumed \"scampi\" was the shrimp in butter and garlic dish, but it turns out that is an American bastardization of the term. Real scampi is a particular type of lobster - not very common and very expensive, which is probably how the shrimp and garlic bit happened along. BTW, Marcellino's REAL scampi is lovely, served grilled \"on the half shell\". Plan on sucking all the tasty bits off the shell.",

Busy busy busy atmosphere in oldtown Scottsdale for this special day, we got excited walking up to the door seeing how beautiful the decor was at Marcellino's. Now both my boyfriend and I have each worked in the Scottsdale restaurant industry for over 5+ years, and working on Valentine's Day stinks for sure, so we get that everyone isn't really in their \"best service moods\" but that shouldn't be an acceptable out for not caring about all the people who are about to spend a good amount of money on their special night out at your restaurant! At least fake a smile, and make us think that you care about our experience. Our reservation was at 6:45- we were seated promptly, but the hostess was \"blah\"... Not a word left her mouth on the walk/seating to our table. About 30 seconds after being sat, a man offered us a bottle of still water to begin with, he was very polite, and I was disappointed to find out he was only the busser/serving assistant because his welcome was probably the best part of our whole meal. Waitress walks up, \"Hello, what can I get you started to drink?\" No name, no suggestions for a bottle of wine or champagne, oh well. We ordered two cocktails along with the mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer to start. We were told that if we separated our order- aka start with the app, then our entrees are going to take a \"very long time to arrive\"... Um, okay, we are now feeling rushed and uncomfortable. Drinks come about 12 mins later, appetizer tasted like store bought cheese with a strip of prosciutto ($19.95 I believe, ugh?!), another \"blah\"... Entrees are ordered, the gnocchi (which was very good and full of flavor) and a seafood dish including some delicious frozen calamari... :/ Dessert and coffee were then offered, we figured it might be best to get a McDonald's ice cream cone on the way home and save the $14. As were waiting for the check to arrive, here comes my favorite server assistant again! He asked how our meals were, if he could clear our plates, etc. ALL while maintaining a smile. The only one I've seen all night. I wanted to give him a hug. All in all, $143 before gratuity for an average meal. No goodbye or thanks for coming in as we were leaving from the host stand/what looked to be a floor manager. We were pretty bummed with this whole experience. \"Blah\"",

While the meal itself was fine, there was nothing about the surroundings, the environment or the service that justified the cost. You are left with the impression that the target diner is an unassuming tourist sent by the hotel concierge and who doesn't have a backup plan when they see the menu and they can't leave.",

    "text": "The new location for this long time Valley favorite is in Old Town Scottsdale on Restaurant row right accross from Cowboy Ciao.  This used to be Digestiff.    The Marcellino's people have done a wonderful job of creating an entirely different attidtude on this side of Stetson Drive.  Still very cool, very ambient, very laid back and not at all pretentious, but still different experience.  The thick cranberry colored drapesgive an old world quality to the mostly urban brickwork comprising most of the walls.  lit mostly by chandeliers and candlelight, the interior is warm, intimate and easy. No garish paintings or stereo typical florentine towers to be seen.  Well, there was a small reproduction of Rome's \" Mouth of Truth\" bolted to the wall next to the entry that kept staring down at me.  I liked it.  It brought back happy memories of Rome.  We would be experiencing the Tasting menu ($75 with 3 courses and 3 pairings)  Our server, Scott, made sure we had no food allergies or road blocks towards anything in particular.  A small cheese, olive and salami plate arrived first, compliments of the Chef.  Scott then proceeded to send over dish after dish of amazing Italian classics , like the large, single handmade ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach bathed in an almost invisible butter sauce.  There was also some unexpected delights like the polenta strips topped with a chunky portobello reduction and the perfectly portioned filet mignon.  Each was delightfully different and kept our pallettes busy with incredible flavors and textures.  Wine pairings were also carefully selected and added that supreme finish to each plate. The tasting menu with pairings are always different, so you can simply come in sit down and relax and be taken care of. No regretful commitments to be made.  After four courses, with 3 wine pairings we were quite content to fold up our napkins and call it quits, but there was still more!  Scott finished us off with a beautiful Tiramisu accompanied with freshly whipped cream that was ablaze and courted with artfully sliced strawberries.  The Tiramisu was light, airy and delicately creamy.  Live music on Saturday nights differs from week to week from opera to jazz to Sinatra.  This Sunday evening we had a mixture of Sade and other light jazz simmering from the sound system.  A wonderful evening was had and will be remembered.  thank you Marcellino's!",

    "text": "We came here for reaturant week and a birthday. While it was not noted on the restaurant week website or the restaurant's website, your entire party had to order either from the restaurant week menu or the normal menu, no exceptions. We tried to protest this because there was nothing about this on the websites, but the hostess said that it was their first restaurant week and that the chef did not want to make any accommodations. While the food was good, the waitstaff was very rude an unattentive. Our waitress explained their pasta specialties very quickly and then said she would come back for our order. When she came back we said that we would all order off the normal menu and asked if she could repeat the specialties because we were a bit overwhelmed by the menu choices. She was not happy about it but she repeated them and then took our orders. The food came out within 10 minutes piping hot, which was nice but the waitress did not warm us that the plates were hot and my mother unfortunately burned her hand. We were never brought bread, and had to ask for it after we already received our meals. It came with some sort of chilled red spread that was never explained. We asked after the end of the meal and the waitress said it was an eggplant and sundried tomato mix. While we said that we were celebrating a birthday the waitress said that they did not do anything complementary but that they would do a nice presentation of a dessert if we wanted one. We said no thank you but she brought us a nice free biscotti plate that said \"happy birthday\" on it, which was very nice. The restaurant was also very loud and we could not hear each other across the table. Overall it was an interesting experience but not one that I would repeat.",

Every time I left however, I was reminded of how expensive it is, especially if you go with chef and waiter recommendations.  We also have a hard time understanding why the owner/chef will not make guest request changes to any of the entrees.  For example, if someone wants a different sauce with their pasta or their entree prepared a certain way, why would the owner refuse to do so ?  I've seen this happen twice at this restaurant and both time guests have been put in unpleasant positions while ruining their dining experience.    Its too bad that there are not that many great italian restaurants in the Phoenix - Scottsdale area, and Marcellino's falls into that category as well.",

    "text": "Expertly crafted fresh pasta is always a joy.  I went to Marcellino's this past weekend with my wife and some close friends and I have to say the evening was an experience.  Everything about this place screamed romantic Italian dinner from the live music to the tucked away location set back behind Barrio Queen in Old Town.  In many ways the presentation is a throwback to decadent dining where they bring you a view plate of the pasta before the meal while the well trained waiter tells the story of each type of noodle and the delicious dish its served with.  It's something that I enjoy because it reminds me that I'm dining out, and this is a meal that isn't to be rushed.  The food they make here takes time and should be enjoyed accordingly and slowly perhaps with an accompaniment of a few bottles of carefully selected Italian wine. I ended up going with the squid ink pasta with muscles, clams, and half lobster tail in a flavorful red sauce.  In my opinion they had me at squid ink, but beyond that everything was quality, and the juice from the fresh clams and muscles gave a nice seafood flavor to the sauce.  Pricing is what you should expect for the ambience and quality of food.  I could see myself coming here every few months because the pasta, and the fact that the chef/owner took the time to come out and ask us how our meal was.  It shows that he truly cares and that he's confident in the product that he's turning out.",

    "text": "I was impressed how nice the restaurant looked, it was very pretty.  We were greeted by a pleasant hostess and seated at a nice table.  Our waitress, Vita, was perfect example of what all wait staff should model themselves after.  She was very knowledgeable about every item on the menu and was very energetic and enthusiastic.  If the owners of Marcellino read this, all I can say is, \"NEVER LET HER GO!\"  OK with that being said, we ordered the mussels appetizer and the pesto scallop appetizer.  They were good.  The mussels were on the large size and a little tough, but all and all they were good.  The scallops were luke warm in the middle, but still not too cold to eat.  I expected more out of the pesto, it was a little flat on flavor.  They also served us some nice bread with a little red dipping sauce.  It was a nice departure for balsamic and olive oil.  It went well with our wine. Moving on to the entree, we ordered one of the specials to share, the Fettuccine Santa Lucia.  Fresh made pasta Infused with the ink from the cuttle fish.  It came in a spicy red sauce sauteed with mussels, clams, and calamari.  They state that it is served with  1/2 of a 1  1/2 lb. fresh Maine lobster in shell, but the waitress said they would remove it from the shell for us.  So I was on board with that!  The entree was very good, again the mussels were on the tough side but the clams were perfect.  The lobster was sadly overcooked.  The pasta was nice.  We did enjoy that part, but I wish we would have ordered the Tortelloni that was stuffed with Filet mignon and sauteed vegetables.  I think maybe it is not a good time for mussels right now and possibly a vendor/supplier issue?  I had a bad experience with them at a different establishment last week, but that is a different review.  We were so full, we couldn't even think about dessert!  I am sure they were awesome.  We finished out our meal by sipping on limoncello.  Very nice.  This was an enjoyable experience and we will go back.  I have to try that Tortelloni!",

    "text": "While in Scottsdale AZ i was with a group of 8 and this restaurant was recommended by one of the people I was with who told us that he had dined here once before and that it was excellent.  The restaurant had a great low light vibe to it and the inside was clean and neat.  We were seated and served promptly.  So I look at the menu and could not help but to form my first impression that this was going to be one of \"those restaurants\" that has this fancy, cursive, old school-script written menus with a bunch of words on the menu that I did not know how to pronounce.  This silly, cursive, fancy print is pretty annoying and this type of restaurant usually results in the food winding up being average at best.  This is my actual experience anytime I have seen a menu like this.  Anyways this was not the case.  I actually struggled a bit to find an entree on the menu that I really desired.  nothing really stood out quite frankly on the regular menu.  Our server came around and then took our appetizer order.  We went light and ordered the mozzarella and tomato app and fried polenta.  Both were excellent, but both dishes are also kind of tough to screw up especially for a finer dining restaurant, right?  When the server came back after we devoured our apps, she reeled off 6 homemade pasta specials that were not on the menu.  Two of which caught my ear immediately.  So apparently this restaurant makes a bunch of different kinds of handmade, and flavor infused pastas each day along with a certain sauce to go along with it.  I recall one of the dishes being a butternut ravioli, and another being a sheet type of pasta with a Gorgonzola cheese sauce and chicken.  (A friend of mine sitting near me got this dish and it was awesome).  I went for the papardelle with a red lamb ragu.  It was epic to say the least.    Everybody at my table told me that they truly enjoyed their meals and unfortunately so much that we were too full to try any dessert.  Being from the east coast I did not expect much at all from an Italian restaurant in Arizona, I seriously didn't.  I did not mention the service but it was also very good.  Everything was flawless.  This place would be an absolute hit not only on the east coast but anywhere you put it in the US.  I will definitely be back here the next time I visit Scottsdale AZ. Great job.",

We ordered a chicken dish to share and charged us $3 to do so without telling us. The food was bland, over cooked and overall not satisfying. Do yourself a favor and go to Franco's just a short walk away. Same pricing but a MUCH better experience all around. We live in the area and definitely won't be coming back here.",

    "text": "This was a very disappointing experience. The food was overpriced for the quality. The shrimp appetizer, Gamberi  Feta was undercooked and feta cheese was very salty. The dinner was substandard, disappointingly.  The scallopine al gorganzola, veggies were undercooked and tasteless. I chose the fettucini contadine  because the appetizer was bad but the dish was tasteless and had no depth of flavour. We were offered limoncello to make up for the bad appetizer but even that was poor. Save your money and go to a place less pretentious outside the tourist area. We should have gone to Tommy V's.",

Not only that, but they have live music on Thursday and Saturday nights.  Unfortunately you couldn't really hear the live music too well, and the room was very loud, so you couldn't really hear the other people at your table either.  The food was all fine.  We got Polenta for an appetizer, a glass of Wine, and 2 Fresh-Made Pasta specialties - one stuffed with filet mignon.  None of it, outside of my wife's pasta with sausage entree, was particularly memorable, and none of it (based on taste and portion size) was worth the price we paid ($130 total).    Service was just OK.  Our server was too busy, so after greeting us, we waited 5-10 minutes before another server came by and took over.    I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.  There are too many other excellent restaurants in Scottsdale to choose from.",

I was surprised to see no lasagnas on the menu but our server explained to us that all of their food is authentic Italian, traditional to the region in Italy where their chef is from. We started off with their scallops appetizer served in pesto sauce, which were definitely some of the best tasting scallops I have had in years. For our entrees I had pasta with black truffle and homemade sausage and my husband had the tortellini filled with filet mignon. Both were absolutely amazing. My truffle pasta was light and delicate but so flavorful , and that tortellini dish is my husband's new favorite. They were both our server's recommendations and his wine suggestions were on point as well.  We will definitely be coming back for another romantic dinner next time we're in town",

    "text": "Had a bad service related experience here. I brought 3 co-workers to this restaurant in hopes it would be a great meal and came away with a bad taste in my mouth...well not literally, food was OK. We walk in and sit at the bar for a few drinks to begin the night and were greeted by the bartender who seemed OK. The restaurant was pretty empty and we decided to just eat our over priced pasta at the bar. We eat, and again, it was just OK. It was also weird that the bartender only paid attention to 2 of us the entire time and failed to refill drinks even though it was more than obvious considering we were AT THE BAR. The bartender wasn't at all providing the service we'd expect considering how empty the place was and how close in proximity we were to her. Then comes time to pay the bill. It totalled $619 and I tipped $100 (16%). My company has a strict 15% tip policy. Yes, I can go beyond that when the service is exceptional BUT it fell way flat. Keep in mind we were only there for 2hrs...After she took the bill her mood became childish. Her face looked as if she was PERFECT and we stiffed her with no tip...She kept shaking her head and rolled her eyes when one of us asked for more water. At the end of the night she went out of her way to say thank you to ONLY one of us at the bar. Besides that, she didn't say a word to us BESIDES mentioning that I failed to tip her. She acted like it was a joke but her face said it all... Dear Bartender, you were NOT good at service that night and even if you think it came off as a joke you should NEVER mention a tip to an entire group. If you had a problem with it, you could have privately said something to me. You purposely tried to make your customer look bad and that's flat out HORRIBLE. You are NOT entitled to a good tip! You earn it!!! I understand you have others to tip out so maybe you should consider that when serving customers. You made the entire restaurant look bad. I won't come back and because you purposely tried to make me feel bad in front of my co-workers...Here you go! *post review*",

    "text": "The reason I give one star is because I can't give zero. Had arranged a dinner last night for three couples and anticipated a nice evening. This was destroyed by Marcellino. My wife, sitting next to me, had ordered calves liver for her entree. She was served chicken by one of the wait staff. It was sent back, only to be returned to her by our waitress, who argued that was what she had ordered (my friend sitting next to me and I both knew differently). It was finally decided, with some difficulty, that the chicken would be replaced with the liver. Imagine our surprise when she was served veal. At that point, my wife was so angry that we cancelled her dinner. The waitress and the manager apologized and even offered to serve us desert (in which none of us had any interest) without charge. We declined.   We were treated poorly and with little other than a perfunctory apology and offer of free desert. My wife left hungry and angry. My meal was indifferent but I just left angry. My friends were truly surprised by the level of service and particularly by the seeming apathy towards the repeated mistakes. I suppose I should be grateful that we were not charged for her dinner.   Obviously, we will not be back.   After posting this review, I received a response from the owner and wife of the chef inviting my wife and me to be their guests at a dinner to demonstrate their passion and commitment to fine dining.  While I appreciate the invitation, I will point out that the six people at our table all shared in the disappointment and the poor attitude of those who served us.   If the other couples are invited as guests, we will accept the invitation. Otherwise we will decline. I don't believe my wife nor I would wish to face the scowl I received from the chef when I cancelled her order without reinforcement.",

    "text": "This was a first visit to Marcellino. First, walking into the restaurant, I was immediately a fan, a warm, charming grotto-like place that reminded me so much of my favorite restaurants in Europe. We sat and waited at the bar for the other couple to arrive. The bartender, Daisy, was personable and the house prosecco was just the way I like my prosecco, mellow and not overly sweet. For a starter course, I order the beef carpaccio and my partner ordered a special, a ball of bufala wrapped in prosciutto with tomato. Our entrees were the Fagottino di Pollo (chicken rolls stuffed with cheese) and Strozzaprete ai Broccoli di Rape (pasta strips rolled into long thin tubes with rapini in a white wine sauce). Dessert was the ricotta cheesecake. All were crafted exactly as you find it in Italy. The carpaccio was beautiful large paper-thin slices of the best beef, with small ribbons of fat, exactly as it should be.  All pasta is handmade in house and it is obviously fresh pasta as opposed to dry pasta. This means that the pasta has a very different mouth feel and even a bit of a different taste. I'll caution anyone who likes a good bit of salt in their food...this is not the place. The food is seasoned exactly as it is in Europe which means not highly salted. Some may consider it bland, I consider it as allowing the quality of the food itself be the star. Hector was our server and he pleasantly answered our questions and the courses were perfectly timed and presented. And the cheesecake? Lovely, luscious and not overly sweet, again exactly as it is prepared in Italy. I look forward to returning!",

Due to our daughters tears when we complained, as it was her choice of restaurant and she felt responsible, we let it go and paid our bill.  I wrote them after and have gotten NO response from them.

    "text": "We were in town for a weekend away and our hotel book the reservation.  This place was amazing from the moment we sat at the bar to the time we waddled out of the joint 2 hours later.  The bar:  Classic, perfectly lit, bartender was about as good as it gets (and I can't remember his name).  We had a great bottle of white (Italian) with our friends and chatted with the bartender about dinner suggestions.  Was pleased that of all the items on the menu he actually walked us through many, he asked us questions about what we like and steered us appropriately.  Getting to the food:  It was the first week of October and we chose to sit outside....ahhh, perfect.  The only hiccup of our entire experience came when 10 minutes after seating us we still hadn't been approached by a server.  We flagged the hostess (What's the right way to call the person who greets you, seats you and is one of the owners?) and she couldn't stop apologizing.  What was great was that instead of sticking one of the waiters on us, she saw how much fun we had at the bar and had the bartender act as our server as well.  Food:  Needless to say we all were guided to wonderful dinner choices.  I can honestly say that this was the absolute best pasta-centric meal I've ever eaten.  Mine had 1/2 a lobster, an amazing sauce and other goodness in it.  Is it possible for pasta to melt in your mouth?  Mine did.  The other 3 at the table had the same experience.  We also had a wonderful tour of Italy via the wine that was paired with things.  Dessert was amazing as well.  Marcellino had the quaintness of a family owned place combined with the experience and food quality of a fine restaurant.  I cannot say enough about the quality of the food and the service.  If you have the chance, go there!",

Given the glowing reviews, I will probably give it one more chance at dinner sometime, but it was definitely a let down.  I had a six top, and we were six of the 8 people in the entire place for lunch.    Service was good, with frequent refills, and they left us plenty of time to get to business before taking our orders.  There was an alright red pepper spread for the bread, although olive oil and balsamic would have been a welcome addition.  Most of the table got either grilled chicken or salmon, which came with a small green salad: portions were very small for mid teens to lower 20s per entree for lunch.  I and another person got the shrimp and scallops in a lightly spiced red sauce with linguine dish.  There were plenty of shrimp, but they were small and extremely overcooked: they reminded me of shrimp that have been left in a ceviche for too long.  The scallops were cut into very small pieces, and were also overcooked, although not as badly as the shrimp were.  The sauce was made with fresh tomatoes, which were left in large chunks, and I have to say I would have very much preferred the use of canned San Marzano tomatoes instead: it was mild, with little body to it.  The pasta was not badly done, but seemed a bit soft for my taste in pasta.  Overall, very disappointing, but so many good experiences can't be wrong, can they?",

One time they had Venison on the specials menu and it was so unbelievable I swear I can still taste it.

Marcellino makes sure that your meal is worth savoring and that you will appreciate your evening enough to return.",

It was after 9pm Saturday night. We naturally strolled around Marcellino's on our way back to garage and I said: \"What about trying this before we go?!\" Told the hostess we are looking for a drink and maybe a little bite to eat and we would not mind sitting at the bar. She told us nothing is available for another 45 mins, and she asked if we are going to eat food...?! We said we have already finished our dinner but would not mind to taste a bit of their cuisine and inquired about sitting on a patio or at the bar. There were 3 or more 2-place seats at the bar while we were not offered either one of these. With quite a sarcastic voice she told us: WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY. We have decided to follow her suggestion and left the restaurant -  which made us happy.",

The woman who sat us had tattoos down one arm and a bad attitude.  This should have been my second clue.  The service was slow even though the restaurant was dead.  The food was awful.  We started with the mussel appetizers and the mussels were old.  We complained about it and they said that the mussels were just delivered.  I have spoken with the owners of other restaurants and they have told me that the meat distributors would sell old meat and fish to restaurant owners that didn't know what they were doing.  These people are obviously clueless.  I ordered a shrimp salad and I was told that it would come with four jumbo shrimp, the salad had three shrimp that weren't jumbo.  The cocktails were weak.  This is another place that is doomed to go out of business and it is because the owners are incompetent",

The menu says \"sauteed with Manila clams, olive oil, garlic, white wine and red pepper flakes\". I cannot taste any one of those ingredients. Not even salt. It's just bland. My high school cafeteria had better quality food. I'll just consider the $24 as donation to charity. Maybe the chef just gave up, better give Gordon Ramsay a call.",

    "text": "Wow!  We have lived in AZ for 3 years and this was our first visit to Marcellino.  We have walked by it 100 times and always said we will have to try it.  This was our 4th wedding anniversary celebration.  We got married in Venice Italy and our tradition is always good Italian food to celebrate that memorable event in our life.    Marcellino did not disappoint.  We had 9pm reservations on Saturday and arrived early.   We were originally going to sit outside as requested, but it was still a bit warm and the inside had a fantastic atmosphere.  When it cools down, we may sit outside.    We had a drink at the bar and met a nice couple.  Sima, the owner, could not have been nicer.  She sat us at a great table close to the entertainment.  We started with 3 appetizers (Scallops in Pesto, Grilled Jump Shrimp on Feta & Bacon Wrapped Mozzarella).  For our main course we had Gnocchi Sorrentina & Scaloppene al Gorgonzola).  Our Server, Rashida, was so nice and she never rushed our meal.  In fact, she allowed us to casually enjoy our appetizers and then, when finished and we were relaxing, she asked when we would be ready to have our main courses cooked/served.     The entertainment was nice, although Sima mentioned that she also performs on Thursdays.  Everything was absolutely delicious and perfect! Would absolutely return for the great service, amazing food and warm ambiance.    Not to mention the company of my beautiful wife.  Thank you, Garry & Julie Benjoya",

We were balling on a budget, but even the \"cheap\" glass of red was phenomenal. Then we both ordered two different dinner specials. It was absolutely divine. I'm not exaggerating when I say this is the best meal I've had in a long time. After the meal we ordered the tiramisu. After one bite, we looked at each other and dug in more! I can't remember a time where I was completely satisfied with service, ambiance, dinner and dessert. We can't wait to come back. It was absolutely lovely. Plus the chef does monthly cooking classes that piqued my interest. I recommend this to anyone visiting the area who wants an amazing meal to make their night!",

Being a foodie from NYC, I could only wish this fine establishment was in my town.  Not like their aren't great italian ristos in NYC, but this one stands out in a class by itself. The chef makes all his amazing pastas by hand and infuses many with fresh herbs grown in his garden. Paired with regional sauces from his home town in the Campania region. One bite and your palate is instantly transformed to Italy. The zuppa di pesce with just the right amount fire and a hunk of crusty bread is my favorite. The filet mignon with a Borolo wine reduction, my wife says was cooked to perfection and delicious. The wine- let's just say the wine in a restaurant should reflect upon the chefs knowledge of food and how it pairs. The choices are fabulous.  The front of the house is run like a Swiss watch-efficient, courteous and on point. Thursday's and Saturday's live music is presented for you to enjoy with your dining experience. Just a great place, we love it.",

What you will get is fresh home made pasta, ethereal sauces, and a waitstaff that knows the menu.    After several visits and a boat load of money (this place ain't cheap), I'm a fan.  Today, we were served by Vita. I have rarely met a waitress that was more knowledeagble about the menu or the wine list.  My wife ordered the zuppe de pesce.  Let's just say that the bowl was empty and I could'nt get a piece of bread in there. It was off the charts.  I ordered the \"orange' pasta with shrimp and a light tomato sauce.  I couldn't get it into my mouth fast enough. The rest of our group was equally pleased.  So, why not five stars. This is totally stupid but at this price point, little things should be perfect.  Bread was good but over cooked. And here is my big (but so little that I'm embarrassed) butter with bread should have been softened to room temperature.  Don't miss this place.  Pasta is amazing, service is great.  Just serve fresher bread and softer butter.",

The atmosphere was beautiful and the patio was adorable so we decided to sit outside. It wasn't busy at all and I probably didn't need a reservation for a Monday night. We ordered the scallops for an appetizer. I was shocked when the waiter brought it out because there was only 3 and the price was about $19. Honestly they were so rich and buttery you only need about two to feel satisfied. They were amazing!!! I got the gnocchi with red sauce and they were to die for. They were so rich and had little blobs of melted mozzarella all over. All their pasta is housemaid and fresh. My boyfriend got a pasta with shrimp and mushroom (can't remember the names because they were all Italian and super fancy) and he loved it. It came with a ton of shrimp which I was also surprised by! Overall I loved it and can't wait to return. Paola was our server and she is from Italy. She truly gave us a great experience especially by surprising us with flaming tiramisu at the end for his birthday. I hate tiramisu but it was honestly so creamy and delicious that I can't stop thinking about it! It was about $74 for the two of us but 100% worth it.",

We were in town for a business event. We travel here at least twice a year and always make a trip here.  You do need reservations during prime times or if you have a larger party.  We all ordered cocktails which were pretty to look at, and amazing to drink! They bring out bread with a yummy tomato butter that I could eat right out of the bowl.  They will bring out their fresh hand made pastas of the day and leave at your table to discuss. The handmade pastas are more expensive then the menu, but  they are so worth it. We all had something different to allow us to try multiple things.  They have both cream based and tomato based sauce options. There are mushroom, panchetta, prawns, lobster, baked into this pasta.  Yes, in the actual pasta!  They have a tortellini that has filet minion stuffed in it!  You read that right!!  We did not opt for the desserts this time, but they are all super yummy!  Service is incredible and environment is outstadnding.  If the weather allows, eat outside!",

    "text": "My husband loves truffles (the funghi not the chocolate) and tiramisu, so what better way to celebrate his birthday than to take him to an Italian restuarant. So, I called Marcellino to not only make reservations but to ask if they  still had the truffle pasta dish that I saw some people posted here on yelp. The girl on the phone said that they do currently have a sliced truffle pasta dish but they sometimes sell out. So, I made reservations to have an earlier dinner to ensure that my husband will get this dish. I also asked the girl if the restaurant did anything if we were to celebrate his birthday there and the girl said yes and that they offer a complementary tiramisu.  We arrived at the restuarant and were shortly greeted by our server. I asked about the sliced truffle pasta and the server said that they did not have it currently as it is not in season and will have it later in the year. I was pretty disappointed since the whole reason we were there was because I was told that they would have the sliced truffle pasta dish. So my husband ordered their special squid ink pasta with half lobster and I ordered the truffle butter mushroom pasta dish. My husband said it was decent but nothing amazing. While my dish was 'ok' and I wasn't able to really taste the truffle. Although, they say they make their own pasta, it really just tasted like it was regular store bought pasta. Also, the pasta that I had was quite hard for it being \"fresh\".  After finishing our dinner, our server asked if we wanted dessert. Since it was my husband's birthday I had to get him a dessert. However, another thing they didn't have was tiramisu. Feeling sad at this point as I really wanted my husband to try their tiramisu!!! Their excuse was that they didn't have espresso, I mean how difficult is it to go to the store and buy some espresso! Well, we ended up ordering this chocolate mousse in this cup that looks bigger than it really is. Again, it was just \"ok\".  We finally got our bill and was about to pay until I noticed that the dessert was NOT complementary! So I asked the server and he said that the Chef does not give away free desserts. So I told him that the person I spoke to on the phone when I made reservation said you guys did but he just kept repeating what he had told me.  Basically, I was disappointed the whole night and felt that it was a total bust for trying to make my husband's birthday special.  Overall, this place is too expensive for something that taste store bought. Go somewhere else, you will be less angry with the dinner if you went to Olive Garden. They should also keep their host/tess informed of what they are serving.",

James was our head waiter and I can't say enough good things about the service we received. We were seated at a very quiet table. Dinner started off with complimentary glasses of Persecco to toast our anniversary, along with some cheese and bruschetta. James reviewed the hand made pasta selections but, we already knew we were going to order the Tortelloni filled with Filet Mignon and vegetables in tomato sauce. We decided to share the Beef Carpaccio as an appetizer, Tortelloni as our pasta course and Veal Scaloppine in a creamy gorgonzola sauce. Every course was delicious but the Tortelloni is to die for! Next time, I am going to order this as my main course. We ended our celebration with warm Apple Galetta with gelato for dessert.  Thank you Marcellino's for making this dinner so special for us.",

The noodles were all super fresh and I can't say good enough things about the pasta.   The specials really bothered me. Not the food itself but the way there were about 9 options for specials which the waiter zoomed through. How hard would it be to have a small card also explaining the pasta specials? Our group definitely had a hard time remembering all of them. Finally we did have some issues with the food coming out. Half the groups came out then the other half had about a 10 minute delay. Although the chef and owner personally apologized, i had to dock a star.   I totally understand how it would happen, but sadly the lobster of my dish got tough from politely waiting. And so did the shrimp of another.   Overall, I definitely want to go back just for the pasta!",

    "text": "This restaraunt literally had the worst service I've ever experienced. I don't think that all of the staff was terrible but our specific waiter was miserable. We came for a bachelorette. We were seated right away and they had a table set up for us which was nice. The waiter didn't come to us when we were seated.. fine... but we were hungry. So when the waiter finally did come I asked him about the specials and, with him failing to hide his sarcasm, he said they don't offer drink specials. I told him I meant specials on food and he goes \"you would like to hear them now?\" Yes that's what I literally just asked. So he tells us the specials which are extensive and their price range. Someone asks a specific price for a specific meal and he tells us the price range again. She asks again for a specific price, not a range, so he huffs and goes to the register to find out. Not a huge inconvenience considering it was literally 4 feet away but his attitude was as if we just asked him to run a marathon. Ok so next we want appetizers. We're asking him various questions about what he would recommend and how much comes with each plate, because there are 6 of us and we want enough food. Apparently we are taking him too much of his time so he excuses himself and says he needs to help another table. The lack of unprofessionalism was crazy. He comes back and asks if we are ready to order when our previous questions about size of plates hasn't been answered. We ask again and he says if we order too much or too little he'll let us know. We order 2 apps, he says that's the perfect amount. Surprise, it's not. We don't bother ordering more because we're still starving we just want our entrees. Half of our meals were good the other half were underwhelming. The staff that brought out the plates were nice. I honestly think this guy didn't try because he knew his tip was automatically given due to the size of our party. But never in my life would I think a person like this would even get a job in the service industry. I would not recommend this place for any meal of celebration because you will be so disappointed and no one deserves that on a celebratory night.",

The dishes were all lacking flavor. I ordered the ravioli which I was so looking forward to and I was extremely disappointed. It was lacking flavor and was no where near the tasty dish I remembered from before. We also ordered the clam and muddle appetizer which tasted like rubber doused in water. We left spending $150 and wishing we went to Hillstone or another restaurant for our special evening out.",

I thought the atmosphere was nice although it was a tad dark in there...I do actually like to see my food. I found the display of dishes that they bring to your table kind of weird...I don't need to see it...just describe it to me. I also felt like having 6 specials to go over is a bit much...I'm not huge on lengthy waiter/diner interaction - I go to restaurants with either my boyfriend or family or friends and that's who I want to talk to. I'm always polite and I tip well but I don't want to spend all of my time hearing about the menu.   As for the food - I have absolutely  no doubt that they use the highest quality ingredients. I had the gnocchi and while it was obviously  made well the flavor didn't blow me away. Potato dumplings are not exactly bursting with flavor so you need a sauce that tastes awesome - this was just a basic marinara and some mozzarella mixed in. I honestly far preferred the gnocchi dish they served at PastaBar downtown...I have not found anything that compares.   Obviously this is a good restaurant and I don't mean to take away from that but for me it just wasn't a hit - especially considering the cost.",

How about with the amuse busch (to build anticipation in the palette).  Moments after we received the menu a plate arrived with a couple wonderfully pungent olives, several small slices of some kind of salami and 4 small chunks of what I believe was pecorino cheese.  A delicious start and we had barely opened the menu.  We shared the Gamberi e Feta antipasti.  Two HUGE jumbo shrimp (I didn't think the word jumbo really did those bad boys justice) grilled perfectly...tender and juicy.  They were served on a square of lightly fried feta cheese and a bed of cabbage.  The arrangement was so nice that I didn't want to disturb it.  After that we shared 2 entrees:  The Fagottino di Pollo and the Salmone in Crosta di Porcini con Cognac e Porri.  I am not a big fan of salmon but I could become a fan of this salmon.  Flaky, delicious fillet with a wonderful cognac sauce.  I was less thrilled with the chicken.  It was split chicken breasts layered with proscuitto and fontina cheese and smothered in a brown sauce.  Here's the thing about the Fagottino di Pollo.  When I say I was less thrilled I mean it was 4 star chicken.  Everything else about the food and service was 5 stars.  Flat out.    We shared a couple desserts - a tirimisu and a dark chocolate mousse.  The tirimisu had all the right flavors working - mascarpone cheese, chocolate, espresso, rum, lady fingers.  Delicious.  The mousse was also very good.  Dangerously good.  Along the way we had a very well rounded chianti ( Chianti \"I Sodi\", Badia Morrona ) and a very nice white ( Albana \"Colle Del Re\" ).  Even the brewed coffee I had after dessert was very good.  Service was outstanding throughout the evening.  All in all I would place Marcellino Ristorante on the short list of Phoenix's finest restaurants.",

Tucked away in Scottsdale, this little gem is the real deal. In fact, it took me extra long to order because the entire menu was in Italian. The place holds 2 bars, intimate seating in both booths and sperate tables for dates and romantic getaways.   Candle-lit tables, attentive wait staff, fancy place settings, live music, etc. This place has it all. I went here on a (not so great) first date with a guy I met at a bar and he easily dropped $200 on 2 appetizers, fancy water, 4 beers, 2 gigantic entrees and dessert plus (hopefully) a generous tip.   I had the stuffed torteillini because I am a total sucker for lots of pasta. Expecting it to come in a bowl of a bunch of smaller shells, it was actually 4 very large rolls drinched in this heavenly white sauce. I loved it... and so did my date, he ate off my plate. We also order the capriesse salad which came with a beautiful, ripe tomato and a fat slice of parmesan too. The dressing was light but flavored enough that not much pepper was needed.   I cannot wait to go back to this place... on a different date with a different guy. But only if he's paying!",

We had the squid ink pasta with seafood and also the mushroom pasta with lobster. The food was delicious which is why this review gets two stars. But- I called well in advance to make this reservation, and told them it was a five year anniversary- and we were seated at possibly the worst table in the entire place. Not private, not romantic, in the middle of the restaurant in walk ways. And on top of that, we had our food come out BEFORE our bread basket came out. So imagine you're expecting a wonderful evening out with your fiance to celebrate your fifth anniversary, and what you get is some pasta about ten minutes out, served at the worst table in the restaurant. Amazing food Marcellino, I'll give you that. But your customer service and attention to detail is atrocious.",

Pleasing a group is always hard; this time every single guest had praise for the restaurant from food to service. Most ordered from the special lunch menu which offered a handful of different selections from starters to main course, including a glass of wine for $24 total. Not bad. I enjoyed the organic green salad, the gnocchi with tomato and mozzarella, and added the chocolate mousse. No complaints about the food. Minor complaint would be that the breadbasket delivered to our table had 4 small slices of hard baguette, not enough the serve our section of the table. I'm sure they would have delivered more if asked. Also another guest ordered chocolate mousse and his was twice the size of mine, delivered in an ice cream glass filled to the brim with mousse and whipped cream. Mine came in a small martini glass, so I felt a little annoyed by the rather large discrepancy between the desserts. Overall A+ experience with the restaurant letting us hang out for 3+ hours having lunch and our gift exchange.",

It was the ambiance of the restaurant that attracted us, romatic, dimly lit with an outdoor patio. When we walked up to the hostess, we told her we did not have a reservation, though would like to sit for dinner. She was extremely rude, annoyed, and walked away. I actually looked at my husband and started to leave the restaurant, until the waiter nearby caught what happened and seated us on the patio.   The food was amazing-- the gnocchi was so soft and tender, best ever. My husband ordered some special mushroom infused pasta.. It was also delicious. I would definitely return, next time making sure I have a reservation I guess.",

We got fettuccine pasta with asparagus, as well as the steak ravioli and truffle pasta. I don't remember the exact names of everything, but it was all VERY good. I also ordered the \"Bellini-tini\" cocktail, and the caprese appetizer. The chef himself makes everything from scratch, and you can definitely tell from the taste and freshness of the food!

I was very impressed with the plate of homemade pasta menu options that the waiter brought to show us - but then a little disappointed that the majority had red meat in them.   There was one that worked for me, and it was truly outstanding and tasted homemade and chef-prepared.       I loved everything about our dining experience from the service to the meal, except compared to the many restaurants I've eaten at, I thought it was over-priced, even for the high-quality of their food.

I had all the usual suspects in Scottsdale and Phoenix recommended to me, to varying degrees of success.  Most of them were good, but nothing that I would rather go to, than just make my own food at home.  A friend finally brought me to Marcellino's about 5 years ago, back when they were in North Phoenix (I miss that little place).    Since the first day I went, Marcellino has been serving some of the best handmade pasta that I have ever had.  But my absolute favorite are his lamb chops and filet.  With so many favorites to choose from, it's easier most days to just order the chef's tasting menu, which usually includes a duo of my some of my favorite appetizers (scallops, or mushroom polenta, or some buffalo mozzarella and tomato, etc.), a duo of pastas and a carne or a duo.    Not only is the food amazing, there is one server here in particular who always makes me feel like family, Scottie.  His knowledge of the menu, food, wine and the restaurant is flawless and his warm demeanor is incredibly welcoming.  His service takes this place a notch above the rest.",

Italian restaurants are usually known for their great bread. But this has been changed to sliced Italian bread toasted. Heaven forbid if you request more as it takes forever. Just sad that they decided to save a few pennies on bread.  Two of our party ordered Gnocchi Sorren and again there's a cutback-the small portion was even smaller for this visit. I recommend skipping the appetizers as these have been changed. The Caprese-IN THE PAST-had big slices of tomato but this time it was several small tomatoes which was a disappointment at best. The Buffalo Mozzarella was also smaller and just not worth the cost.  Another person ordered the Pappardelle which was ok. The last person ordered the Strozzaprete ai Broccoli which was good. I think it will be some time before we return as this vist was a disappointment that can be avoided by not returning.",

Spinach Ravioli was two large pieces, but missing sauce & seasoning.  It got worse from there.  Our entrees were completely bland.  Absent salt, pepper, and herbs of any kind.  Husband had lamb.  Knowledgeable diner (Cordon Bleu grad) said the \"sea bass\" was tilapia.  They accomodated me with chicken, it had some tomatoes on it, but just was missing flavor.  I'm not sure if they dumbed down their seasoning thinking to aim for something a person from the Midwest would like, but we're from Texas and we were VERY DISAPPOINTED in this food.  Can't remember what we had for desert, but it was ample & tasted good.  Servers did a good job, considering the size of our group.",

We sat on the patio and were surprised by the fact that a dog ran into the restaurant (not a service dog) and then the owner picked it up and was seated on the patio.  The owner of the dog processed to kiss the dog at the table tongue and all.  It was unsettling lucky we had already finished our meals.  Very odd that an upscale Scottsdale restaurant would allow this.  We would probably not go back",

    "text": "I can honestly say that Marcellino Ristorante in Old Town Scottsdale is one of my favorite restaurants! :)   My boyfriend & I went here on Saturday night and not only had an amazing dinner but another overall amazing experience!  Before dinner, we sat up at the bar where we had a few glasses of wine. Our bartender, Lou, took the time to get to know my name and made sure that my glass of wine was always full. It is evident that he truly cares about his customers and his restaurant.  For dinner, we started with the Imported Buffalo Mozzarella & Prosciutto appetizer. It was a generous portion and was wonderful. The ingredients are always fresh and it was the perfect way to start off our meal. (I'd say this is perfect for two people to share, unless you are really hungry!)  My boyfriend had the Santa Lucia for his main entree. It was delicious- And yes, he was generous enough to share. It is a \"Black cuttle fish ink infused fettuccine sauteed with muscles, clams and calamari in a lightly spiced tomato sauce and topped with half of a 1 1/2 pound fresh Maine lobster.\" (I took this off their website because I decided my description could not do it justice.) It was an absolutely incredible dish- One not to be missed!  My dish was fairly similar to the Santa Lucia but not as big. Unfortunately the name is escaping me at the moment but it is a spicy tomato sauce with shrimp, fresh fish and calamari. It is phenomenal and worth every carb ;)  Our servers were both Rob & Johnny. They provided outstanding guest service! Oh and since it was a Saturday night, there was live entertainment. Some might consider the entertainer to be a \"cheesy lounge singer\" but I thought he was really good and put some romance (and laughs) in to our evening... Watching my boyfriend imitate and sing \"At Last\" to me was priceless.   Overall, if you are looking for an authentic Italian dinner with incredible service and owners that really care about their restaurant, I'd say come to Marcellino Ristorante! You'll not be disappointed.",

    "text": "I'd heard about Marcellino for many years but never made it over there when they were in Phoenix.  My friends and I decided to check them out this last Saturday.  This is my third visit to the space that previously was occupied by Digestif, Tutto and now Marcellino.  Luckily for Fred Unger, he probably has a tenant here who will make it.    They changed the entrance and once I found my way in I was reminded what a great space this room is.  The exposed brick, dark colors and candlelight are very romantic.  Once seated we tasted a few wines and decided on a nice Barbera reasonably priced at $47 for the bottle.  Our appetizer was a bufalo mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto with tomato and basil.  It was a delicious start to the meal.  Since there were four of us we all decided to order something different so that we could all try each other's dish.  They show you the different pastas and explain the specials of the day.  Literally, all of the specials sounded great and it was tough to make a decision.  I ordered the porcini fettuccine which came with lobster.  Who doesn't like lobster but actually the pasta stole the show.  It was a real earthy, rich flavor that I loved.  The other dish that really stood out to me was the filet mignon and truffle tortelloni.  How can you go wrong with those ingredients?  To top off the evening they had live opera singers entertaining during dinner.  I've read people complain about the prices at Marcellino but I really don't agree.  Our bill was $207 plus tax and tip for four people.  For a topnotch meal with wine it was worth every penny to our group.",

Second time was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in old town in years.  1st when greeted by the hostess she had an attitude and wasn't very inviting.  2nd when we decided to sit at the bar because the hostess was so rude it took over 20 minutes for us to place our drink order.  3rd the owner knocked my friends purse on the floor instead of apologizing immediately she instructed my friend to put her purse on the hooks under the bar.  And finally, there was a bug in my ice cube.  In all fairness our drinks were compensated for the bug; however the attitude of the owner / hostess was so awful I won't be returning or recommending their restaurant to others.",

I ended up ordering something that had ragu and sausage in the description.  Still having no clue what I had just ordered.  When I got my meal it looked something like spaghetti but the noodles were extremely thick and robust.  I was very disappointed as it tasted very similar to Chef Boy R Dee ravioli.  I'm not being mean that is exactly what it tasted like.  Hardly any meat in the sauce.  I'm pretty sure there was maybe 1 dollar worth of food on the plate.  I'm sorry but the food was bad, service was slow and my God how uneventful and plain.  Will spend my money at Olive Garden next time.",

    "text": "They say first impressions are sometimes wrong. I say you can figure out how the establishment is even with a simple order 'to go'.   I called the restaurant on a Thursday night around 6 and spoke with Logan who put me on hold for 10 minutes. After that, I simply hung up and called again. A different person answered the phone and courteously took my order of spaghetti clams with white sauce. I remembered repeating the word SPAGHETTI since I didn't want anything else with the clams. I knew they had their dish called \"Scialatielli\" clams however I figured no Italian restaurant in town would be out of spaghetti. I also asked what the soup of the day was and the waitress didn't even know. Bad. At 6 o'clock your shift should have begun already. Not knowing what their soup du jour is already makes me not want to order it. Indeed I stuck with the spaghetti only.   After all this journey, I get to the restaurant and my order was ready. Good. But it was not what I ordered. The lady I spoke with did indeed put the Scialatielli with clams, which is more of a fat over cooked chewy version of the linguine with a little bit of red sauce. Too bad I didn't check on the moment. I would have sent it back and not paid for it.   What it pissed me more is that they really TRIED TO FOOL ME!! SCIALATIELLI IS NOT SPAGHETTI! The waitress came to me and with an attitude of an arrogant said that Scialatielli is the Italian word for spaghetti. NO. YOU BACK UP AND YOU SHUT UP!! I'm from Italy my dear, authentically FROM Italy. I was born and raised in Milan, been here for 3 years, my last name is Petrucci and I absolutely do not accept this prank.  Scialatielli might be a Southern Italian dialect for spaghetti. But it's not even close to it. In Italiano si dice spaghetti. Gli Scialatielli li conoscete solo voi!!!   If you didn't have spaghetti, I would have MUCH APPRECIATED YOUR HONESTY, instead of making me pay $25 (plus tip cause I personally always tip) for a lousy pasta dish.   I've heard the owner is from Benevento, perhaps she should go back there to make those Scialatielli. I would have hold my opinion if the food was good. But after the outrageous customer service, I cannot be silent.   No one likes to be made a fool of. I will do my best to DEFAME your business.",

The restaurant is very nice upscale Italian restaurant.  They even had a small band playing soft rock Our bartender was quick and friendly.  Our waiter at the table brought us a plate which he placed at the center of the table and quickly went into a lecture about the the different pastas they served.  But we couldn't hear him because of the band.  We ordered a caprese appetizer . Which was light and fresh before our entree. I ordered a spinach salad for my entree very simple, pancetta crumbles, shaved parmesan and a light dressing it was ok .  My husband ordered a Ragu sausage Pasta plate.  He said it tasted like canned chef boyardee. Lol!  I sampled it and it did have a very generic sauce on it lol!  The couple we were with were not impressed with their choices either.

Of course there is a large party on Friday, I bet they had reservations in advance.  Run your business and staff correctly.  Very over priced: $26 for gnocchi and 2 beer choices only at $7 each.  You made a great evening pretty bad.",

It's as though someone said we have to offer this so they Googled a recipe and bam there you go. Cocktails above average. Chocotini a fantastic dessert cocktail. A little hectic for a romantic dinner but still qualifies. Pasta portions gratefully larger than expected Had a 7:30 reservation and were promptly seated. Dinner for two with cocktails ran about $200 out the door.    Most definitely will do again.",

Most likely Because of the picture of the beautiful husband and wife on their website, I knew this would be the right choice.  Seated promptly I began asking questions about the wine, specifically the Amarone. Turns out the owner worked at Amorone in Nyc, a place where I have so many fond memories. As I looked around the restaurant I could see the similarities but taken far beyond with their own passion for life.  Pasta waits for no one! Any they have it, handmade and as you can see from my pictures, fantastic!  To start I had the carpaccio di manzo. The same as I used to eat at NYC but served with a greater passion. Thinly sliced, raw tenderloin blankets arugola topped with sliced fresh mushrooms, perfectly shaved Parmigiano and herbed lemon dressing to play games with your taste buds.  Before I left the owner told me the story of his wedding night in NYC, which is the picture he and I stand next to. I used to say, ONLY IN NEW YORK---and now ONLY NOW  in SCOTTSDALE.  Piano Piano",

We sat inside and the ambience was nice. Our waiter, however, made a bad impression. He was decidedly unhelpful and curt. He sounded rehearsed and not interested in helping us. One member of our group asked \"what's a favorite dish on the menu?\", which is a VERY common question and one that any good waiter should be able to answer. He said \"it depends on the night\" so she asked again, \"well is there something on the main menu that is a go-to\"? He looked directly at her and said \"it depends on the night.\"    this went on for about 2 more iterations and he finally said the calves liver were popular.  We had to ask for bread, which was complimentary. It was dried, thin slices with not much flavor. I split a salad and veal ragu with a friend because we were traveling for business and knew we didn't want leftovers. The salad was so small that we literally each had 3 bites. Same for the ragu. The others at our table did not share and their dishes would have been plenty for two people. It appeared as if our portions were deliberately made small because we were sharing. I had 2 glasses of the house Cab and my bill was $60. Pretty steep for 6 bites of food and 2 glasses of wine. I wouldn't go back.",

We always have a drink at the bar and I have to stay that the holiday drink they have was unbelievable! Please keep it on the menu.  They sat us in the little romantic cove in the wall which was super cute and cozy. We were so lucky to end up having Eric take care of us last night. His knowledge of food and wine pairing was outstanding I don't have enough good words to say and he was so friendly and passionate. We chose the beef carpaccio dish with a glass of white wine to start. Then he suggested the osso bucco for my boyfriend and I chose the tortellini but sauced with a black truffle savory sauce rather than the traditional red. And lemme tell you, these 4 giant tortellini are filled with slow roasted beef and veggies pureed together for the most amazing comforting dish. And the wine of course paired perfectly. For dessert, Eric suggested we keep it simple and clean and served us a light orange sorbet with whipped creme and caramel drizzle. Yum! The experience every time we choose Marcellinos just keeps getting better and better.",

If you're not familiar, Marcellino features a dazzling authentic Italian menu with house-made pastas such as squid ink fettuccine, and a great wine selection. We had an incredibly fresh and creamy buffalo mozzarella and also the Scallop al Pesto.   I enjoyed a delicious ravioli filled with pureed choice beef, and one of our guests enjoyed a stunning seafood fettuccine with half a Maine lobster. Beautiful dishes.   The three hours simply blew by, and our server Jeff was a True delight. I highly recommend Marcellino!!",

At $25 it should have been loaded. Others in my party ordered the scallops, which were tiny and squid ink infused pasta, which had no taste and was bland. That plate was $45!! Another ordered the veal and it was paper thin. The mussels were in a watery, tasteless sauce. The bread was so small, you'd think they were a relative to Melba toast. If this is first class dining...then you can have it! I work hard for my money and will never throw it away on mediocre cuisine such as this place. We went out later and had pizza and fro-yo which actually turned out to be the highlight of our night! BTW, we should have known better when we walked in, there wasn't a single customer in the place!

We chose the spinach ricotta ravioli that came with a light butter sauce and my boyfriend chose a pasta with portobello mushrooms and lobster, also came with a light sauce. The food was to die for!!! As for dessert, the tiramisu came out with a flaming sugar cube on the side, it was plated beautifully. I was expecting to be blown away but the tiramisu didn't have enough marscapone and way too much cocoa powder (totally my opinion-does NOT take away from the quality or deliciousness of the food). All in all-these people are doing a fantastic job. Will definitely be back!",

I usually like balsamic vinegar with it, but I didn't dare to ask for some (maybe next time).  I also had the Fetuccini Contadina which was pretty good.  Tiramisu and coffee were also outstanding.     My friend had an out of the menu pasta with pork belly which was pretty good although a little too salty from my point of view.  The wine menu (by the glass) has only Italian options. Although it's an Italian restaurant, I would appreciate certain variety (but this is just a preference).  BTW, the bathrooms are clean, and with a great decor.  Cheers.",

The wine selection is good as well as affordable.  So many restaurants fail at both good and affordable.   The wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable but the key were the bussers. They stood attentively at the bar all night weighting to fill glasses, clear tables assist wait staff etc... pretty impressive.   Bottom line, good meal, ambiance and extremely reasonable price tag.",

    "text": "Chef Marcellino openly states that he is passionate about maintaining the integrity of True Italian cuisine.  So, we had to try this place to see.  We went with friends, who had been there before and said that they enjoyed the food.    The ambiance was initially nice.  The interior was nicely decorated, the tables spacious enough to hold plates, food and drink, and the waitstaff was polite, professional, and somewhat accommodating.  When I asked the waiter to inform me of his favorite dish, he seemed offended and wouldn't bother answering my question, which was odd.    The start of our meal went sour quickly, when some lady starting singing.  One of the waitstaff told us it was the owner's wife.  I later found out her name is Sima.  Well, this Sima lady was not only the worst singer in the world, but she thinks so much of herself, the volume on the sound system was insanely loud.  You couldn't hear yourself think, let alone enjoy a meal.  Fillings in my teeth were loosening with each off-pitch note that she belted out.    Now we understood why the dinning area of an Old Town location restaurant was half-empty.  We tried to weather the storm and our mildly rude waiter and another, apologized.  They said that because it was the owner's wife, they couldn't do anything about the horrible singing, or ask her to stop.  The table next to us were complaining too, but we were all victims (no warning signs as you walked in).   The sound system so loud, there was no possible way to hold a conversation.  This Sima lady hijacked our meal, our conversation, and our lives.  A True nightmare!     After her third song, we couldn't handle it anymore, we asked to move our table to the outside seating area in the heat.  We figured, sweating over dinner would have been better than being tortured by Sima and her horrible, overly loud, singing.  Once we got outside (very nice seating area outside), we could finally enjoy some food. The Italian food was decent! Having lived and traveled to Italy many times, I would have rated this place 3 1/2 to 4 out of 5 stars, if it weren't for the insane singing issue.  The food was definitely better than Italian chain restaurants.  The pasta selection was very good, if not awesome, the sauces were very good too.  The main dishes were a little disappointing, so I would stick to the pasta.  But at ALL COSTS, avoid the singer.  We were later told that the singer is not there every day, so plan accordingly or bring ear plugs.  If the owner reads this, keep your wife off the microphone.  She has no business singing in your otherwise good restaurant.",

The service was absolutely the best from the hostess to the servers, so friendly and genuinely happy you came to their restaurant, literally every employee was so nice.  Now comes the best part of our experience at Marcellino, the food was the absolute BEST Italian food I've ever had. Seafood, handmade sun-dried tomato pasta, delicious!!!! Also we tried the gnocchi in white sauce which was outstanding!!! Pretty sure I'll be traveling from Seattle to Scottsdale just for Marcellino!!!!",

I told her we would eat fast and would probably be done before these \"reservations\" arrived but she said no. We again, begged her for a table outside but she refused.   Only after another round of begging did she seat us in a walkway outside against a wall. Not on the actual patio. During the meal, we realized not one party had been seated outside and all the tables were still available.   After we finished eating, about an hour and a half later, all the original tables, plus more, were available. I went in to confront the hostess and the nasty manager was next to her only making excuses for why they didn't seat us outside as originally requested. I asked if they had seated anyone on the patio and what happened to their mystery \"reservations\" and got no response or apology.   Management should be ashamed of themselves! I am sorry I have this place my business.",

Like other Yelpers suggested, the specialty pastas and where it's at - don't even bother looking at the regular menu.  Our server was incredibly knowledgeable. We asked her suggestion for a full-bodied red wine that wasn't too dry. She had one in mind she said wouldn't break the bank (turned out to be $17/glass - one of the lowest on the price scale) and to our surprise, she delivered perfectly and we both really enjoyed it.  My husband got the pasta with cheese and pepper made as part of the dough, which came with crisped proscuitto, while I went for the homemade sausage and truffle dish. We were truly BLOWN AWAY at how good our dishes were. We both ate the very last bites and still managed to share some tiramisu. This place is amazing and while probably as expensive as a dinner we'd go ($150 before tip), there were some other places we considered with multiple courses and costs twice the price (though still $$$ on Yelp). We would happily do this over again and would recommend to anyone looking for a low-key, romantic evening with incredible eats.",

The food was good although my wife did not enjoy her meal at all. Was a little cold and tasteless. I had the osso bucco which was very good.

I had a filet mingion with truffles which wasnt in the menu but the chef made it for me and must say, I was blown away!!! If you have traveled to italy or europe and have cultivated your palate you will know exactly why you should eat at Marcellinos. If You havent, you should eat here because it will transform you to a place you will want to experience. These restaurantours know what they are doing. Whether you want to Choose a great bottle of wine from his carefully chosen list or just a glass from a wide selection of offerings, you cant go wrong. The pickins are great and this I appreciate.

The atmosphere was very nice, with live music, we were seated more towards the entrance of the restaurant so the music did not drown our our conversation. Our server introduced himself and it was smooth sailing for the rest of the evening.  Our guest ordered a bottle of wine to share and my friend and I ordered cocktail while reviewing the menu. We started off with Beef Carpaccio. Pear Salad and Shrimp with Feta appetizers. Entrees were the Mussels in Spiced Tomato Sauce, Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli, Veal Scaloppine with Gorgonzola and Gnocchi. We ended the night with Cappuccinos.  All the food was delicious and our server excellent as he was so patient in letting us catch up with conversation while still be attentive, so patient that we managed to be the last table of customers in the restaurant and were not asked to leave because of closing.  Atmosphere: very nice, Service: excellent, Food: very good, and thank you for letting close the restaurant... most enjoyable night.",

The mozzarella was very rubbery like the one bought from a supermarket. Their signature pasta was thick and bland. The pork medallion was totally inedible and the only good item in our order was the wine. At some point the chef/owner came to talk and would no go away till we started to get up. This was definitely frendliness bordering on harassment.",

A European style manner of serving (low pressure with an emphasis on providing a great culinary experience). From our water glasses constantly being refilled, wine being poured, to bringing out fresh silverware and side plates between courses was constantly being done without ever needing to ask. The service was GREAT. The current pasta specials were presented and what they were paired with was explained. Next time we will have to get the gnocchi. There were options for vegetarians, meat lovers, and seafood eaters. The desserts we tried were also very good. We went with a group of friends and the atmosphere was good for both groups or it could have also worked well for a date night. Just in case, I would recommend making a reservation because it started to get a little busy/fill up even on a Monday night. The location is great, a parking garage right below, and the ambience was very nice (not too casual, but not at all stuffy). We will definitely be back!",

The chef's wife came by to wish him a happy birthday. We even received multiple complementary courses (an appetizer, dessert, and drink). Service was outstanding-definitely no rush from staff. We opted for two of their off-menu homemade pasta dishes. We ate: scallop pesto appetizer (scallops were a bit small for price but sauce was yummy to dip their bread in). We also ordered the homemade filet, vegetable, cheese tortellini (my favorite) and a spicy sundried tomato pasta with shrimp and scallop). They are expensive but well worth it. Our waiter even offered to split the plates and course them out since we wanted to share- a very classy offering that allowed us to each get to try both pastas w/o having to share a plate and take our time through the meal since they were coursed out for us.

We were very impressed with the atmosphere of this restaurant. Although we chose to sit outside, the location proved to be very hidden and private-- perfect spot to take your date! Our server was perfect and extremely attentive. Even though he knew we were only ordering desserts, he still took the time to go through their best options. We decided to go with a couple glasses of wine, some coffee, and a Tiramisu to share. The attention on our table was never lost, in fact, as the night grew chilly, our server came back and helped move a heat lamp closer to our table to keep warm.  The Tiramisu was excellent and I'm truly sorry to say I wasn't able to experience more of their great food! Will definitely be back on the next trip!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to visit Marcellino's the night before Christmas Eve to celebrate with a decent dinner before heading back east for the holidays. Unfortunately, this was a huge mistake and I would strongly discourage anyone from ever visiting this place. The first red flag was one which many others have stated before, was that the restaurant was completely empty. The hostess quickly questioned us if we had made a reservation, and without further ado she, as well as our waiter gave us a head to toe scan. Both of us felt quite uncomfortable in our casual patagonia sweaters. In hind sight Im glad that I didn't wear a nicer outfit since it would have been a complete waste. The ambiance of the place is completely commercialized with a tacky unauthentic Italian feel (yes, it really is like a fancier olive garden).   The worst part about this place was the remarkably awful service. Our waiter who left halfway through our meal (thank god) was a complete arrogant ass. While looking over the wine menu, our waiter suggested that he make some recommendations since it was taking us longer then 5 minutes to decide on a bottle. After questioning our knowledge on Italian wines, the waiter proceeded to question us on our price point in the most obnoxious and uncomfortable way, (he then flipped through the menu narrating which wines were and were not in our price range... how helpful) my boyfriend felt like he was being financially assessed. After ordering the wine I quickly requested a Caprese salad so that I could limit the interaction with the waiter- but alas! He denied my request and proceeded to come back with a fake plate of pasta, a 12 minute sales pitch, and a tiny florescent light to point with. How romantic. It was a horrible experience, and I assured him after wasting all of our time that I would go with my original request. The best part of this experience was the fact that this waiter was unable to pronounce any of the dishes correctly. Hello?! My first suggestion would be to train your staff on Italian pronunciation- at least make sure they can pronounce the listed dishes correctly.  The food was...edible but everything was unnecessarily dramatic. I was able to catch a glimpse of the chef who was schmoozing with who I would assume to be his regular customers obviously we did not even get a glance from him (mind you there were only 4/5 tables occupied at 8 pm). Before our entries arrived our waiter made a dramatic exit speech and introduced us to our new waiter who assured us that our previous waiter was going home to spend the holidays with his lady, a detail I could have cared less about particularly after he ruined my night.   All together the experience was one which I would like to forget and we quickly left once our entries were finished. After spending a good portion of my life traveling all over the world and having a mother who assessed hotel hospitality, I was hourly unimpressed by this restaurant and will not be recommending it anytime soon.",

Marcellino offered multiple options for a three course dinner. Most of my party started with the mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto served on top of a tomato with roasted red peppers on the side. It was a delicious twist on a caprese salad. For the main, most of us chose the Paccatela pasta. This was a short cut thick pasta noodle with a sausage ragu. It was exceptional. For dessert, our group enjoyed both the Tiramisu and the Panna Cotta. Yummy. The entire staff was attentive and personable, and Chef Marcellino even dropped by our table to welcome us. What a great meal and evening. We will definitely return.",

    "text": "Sometimes it's more than just the food at the restaurant! You can't really ignore the setting, decor and ambiance of this place. It's literally nestled in Old Town near the galleries and sunken below the street level. It's surrounded by wine art-like bottles coming out of concrete walls and fountains, wrought iron, and shrubs and greenery. I mean, you could get engaged here it's so beautiful and romantic! ME, however; I'm there for the food! And it's tadiefawr!! We had the special appetizer which was a Buffalo mozzarella with prosciutto and olive oil drizzle. Salads were fresh and crisp. I went with the veal scalopine and it was incredible. They offered options and variations of some dishes which gave you the ability to mix and create a  little. I would love to try sometime for lunch. There was music on the patio outside but we were in the restaurant area. Now that it has cooled down, I would go back and sit outside. I bet it's amazing! The waiters and wait staff are sophisticated and educated on their dishes so talk them up and get their feedback. This is probably now one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale for sure for the whole experience. Unforgettable!",

    "text": "How can I not give Marcellino five stars?  The food was fantastic - as was the experience.  We'd been hearing about Marcellino Ristorante for awhile but it wasn't until we were looking for a place to celebrate Mother's Day that we thought to check it out.  From the moment I called to make a reservation, we received the friendliest service ever!  I was told that they could take our group at 6:45 and that they'd have a live Opera Singer (specifically a Tenor) in house that night performing - what a treat!  Well - that's what I figured when they told me that.  (None of us were opera fans before and we still are not opera fans, but it did add to the experience!)  We were seated right away and Scott was our server.  He was attentive and patient with us, even when Jared had him repeat the specials several times.  Their homemade pasta specials looked incredible, but I stayed away... Instead, I enjoyed the Insalata Ortolana, a few bites of the Canestina Polenta (if you like polenta and you like mushrooms, get this - it's incredible), and I shared the Gamberi Affogtai entree with my mother-in-law-to-be.  We requested extra veggies instead of mashed potatoes and not only did they oblige, but the broccoli, cabbage, and asparagus we received were delicious!  The shrimp were magnificent as well - juicy and tender!  Oh - I have to also admit to having some of the 'special sauce' they serve with the bread basket... it is tangy and wonderful - if you go, you must try that too.  It's made with eggplant, olive oil, and red pepper I believe... yum!  Jared and his sister had a Caprese Salad (a bit overpriced at $12.95), the Paccatelli al Ragu (a bolognese pasta dish I believe), the Scaloppine al Gorganzola (a veal dish that he enjoyed but serving size was not as big as he'd wished for).  We finished off the meal with an Apple Galetta served with hazelnut gelato and a Panna Cotta (similar to flan).  While I had just a small taste of the apple one, I can report that it was delicious... and since Jared and his mom finished off the panna cotta, i'll assume it was not so bad either.  All of the above plus a pellegrino, a coffee, and a cappuccino for $159.85 before tip.  Note - no alcohol.  So, yes, we wish it was more affordable - but we'll be back without a doubt!",

    "text": "I first went to Marcellino Ristorante, on a recommendation from strangers, by playing hookie when I was a sophomore in college, not long after they'd opened.   It was an expensive lunch, since I had three courses and ordered one of their specials, but it was very good, and Sima, who runs the front of the place, was delightful.   I came back a couple times and was just blown away by how good everything was. My early enthusiasm was borne out with its various New Times awards, and it has been my pleasure since then to turn many satisfied people on to what is without a doubt the best Italian restaurant in Arizona, and in my opinion one of the best overall.   The place's new location does it justice, although those of us prone to nostalgia miss the old one. I spent most of the last three years overseas, and when I was back visiting home, Marcellinos was always my top priority, and never disappointed me.   Everything that they make is excellent, though I'm particularly attached and addicted to their thick, short, toothsome Pacatelli pasta with ragu di salsiccia , which is generously available at a discount for lunch.    I don't know whether or not anyone can say that it is \"perfect\" pasta, but I would wager a lot that there is no pasta that is better. It is flawless. As close to the platonic ideal as we can get.   The same could probably be said of their tiramisu.   Unfortunately it's not possible anymore to spend an afternoon drinking wine and espresso and smoking cigars on their patio, but that was only ever just icing on the cake.",

I'm sure these are all people who feel if something is expensive and overpriced, then that translates to exceptional.  First off, the service was almost non existent and the most I can say is that everyone we encountered from the hostess to the waiter who took our order, is that they were very cold and almost arrogant - the farthest thing from friendly service.  We ordered mussels in the red sauce as an appetizer. Very ordinary and the sauce had hardly any taste at all. Some of the mussels were actually empty shells.  Next we ordered the green salad with balsamic vinagerette. Really now, $10 for what amounted to  bag salad greens - with nothing else - accompanied with what i assume plain bottled dressing.  Our entrees weren't bad, but not great either - again, just ordinary. All in all, the entire meal was so mediocre, we didn't even want to mess with ordering dessert.  The \"ambiance\" was nothing to write home about..I really have to scratch my head at all the 4 and 5 star reviews.   Not terrible...just way overpriced for what it is...For their prices, I expected to have a phenomenal meal.",

After our awful experience here, I just had to sign up on yelp and tell everyone my our experience (do not disregard because I am new to giving my opinion on yelp). We had no reservations but that doesn't mean you have to give us such a bad attitude when we asked for a table?  Yet, I think they gave us the worst table because we had no reservations?  Literally 2 mins after we were seated, they seated 2 older men right next to us and we might as well been a table of 4!  They were so close and so loud that we were part of their conversation.  How romantic.  The places wasn't even full and there were empty tables! Nice selection of fresh made pasta... But I ended up ordering a dish from their regular menu, Red Linguine Portifino with shrimps and scallops.  The sauce just ok and wasn't even that spicy. And what scallops?  There were barely any in the dish.  And the shrimps...are you kidding me?  They were tiny and with the full tail on which was like half the shrimp because they were so small.  I've been to many fancy italians restaurants and when I order an expensive past dish, I expect not to spend most my time picking the tail off with my knife and fork.  What a pain.  Funny thing is, then loud man sitting next to us order the same dish.  Instead of using his fork and knife, he simply put the whole shrimp in his mouth and used his fingers to pull the tail out.  How classy!!   I almost forgot to add, it was nice one of the chef's walked around and said hello and asked how everything was but if you are going to do that, why exclude CERTAIN tables?  Very rude. All in all, for the expensive price we paid for dinner, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND it!",

With one of the dishes, we ordered a side of veggies, which came out with exactly 3 pieces of zucchini, and 3 pieces of carrots and were charged 9.95 for! unbelievable that they don't have any hesitations with charging you that much after the vegetarian pasta was almost 33 bucks! Anyways, We ended the evening with their ricotta cheesecake, which was also delightful, but I'd definitely recommend having people at the table to share it with.

Growing up right outside of Boston, I went to the North End (Boston's Little Italy) quite a bit for authentic Italian food. I was skeptical as to what an Scottsdale authentic Italian restaurant would be. My first impression of Marcellino's was superb. A very somber and intimate setting. And listening to live entertainment. Already I was impressed.  For the life of me I cannot remember my servers name and I that's a let down because he was superb!! He made me and my company's night all the more enjoyable with his personality and his knowledge of the menu. What happened next was something that I have never seen before and it really added a class act to my experience here. He came to our table with a plate full of the pastas that were made for the day, with a detailed explanation of each type. Very impressive. He also went over each special of the night in great detail, leaving me with no questions to ask him.  After several minutes of glaring at the menu, and thinking about the dinner specials offered, I went with the dinner special of Lamb Ragu over Pappardelle.  My counterpart ordered their Fettuccine Contadina from their Handmade Pasta selection. After several more minutes of conversation and eating bread with a roasted red pepper spread, which was to die for, our meals came to us piping hot, and smelling of ecstasy.  My first bite, I was in love! This was incredibly good. The pasta was cooked perfectly Al dente, and who does not love freshly made pasta?! My Lamb Ragu was divine. I could have eaten about three plates of this dish myself, it was that good. My friends dish was also superb. Again freshly made pasta, with top quality produce, not overly done, which is the Italian way. Keep it simple. Although I didn't get a chance to have dessert, because I was stuffed from bread and pasta, I did see several desserts trailing through the dining room. They all looked to die for.  Marcellino's totally exceeded my expectations for authentic Italian food. I see too many Italian restaurants which typically serve all the same items, i.e. Chicken, Veal, Eggplant Parmesans, and Marsalas, but Marcellino's didn't offer these which was a sigh of relief, and makes me intrigued on going back and trying the other delights that they offer.  I would say that this place would be more suited for a date atmosphere than for big groups. It has a sexy, intimate vibe to it. Feel free to disagree with me on that. With all that being said, I will be back again, REAL soon! Enjoy!!",

The food is still great, the service was very warm, and the whole atmosphere is still inviting and cozy.  I had feared their move to Scottsdale would cause it to become overly trendy and lose focus, but I far undersold Marcellino and his team.  And despite having great food, the prices are quite reasonable.  Having dined in Italy recently, I can say the experience here was on par with that and hope to I to return soon.",

    "text": "My husband and I adore Marcellino's. If you are looking for a special evening out for Italian food, look no further. This is not your family-style restaurant, it's high end with amazing homemade pastas, fresh salads, spotless service, truly a wonderful experience. From the time you make a reservation, you are greeted with warmth, just as if you were invited into their home. We have followed them from their old location in north Phoenix to the new in Scottsdale. Somehow they were able to keep the intimacy of the smaller restaurant to their new, larger location. My only complaint is that the restaurant is so dark it makes reading the menus difficult (they should offer flashlights or invest in backlit menus). We have had two company parties at their restaurant. They easily cater to large groups. Our food arrived steaming hot all at once (incredible for a party of 13). I wish I could recommend a favorite dish, but my favorite is whatever I ordered during my last visit! You can't go wrong with any of the dishes. The bar is we'll stocked and he makes great mixed drinks. Definitely arrive a few minutes early to start off at the bar before being seated for your meal.",

The food is obviously made fresh and was excellent but I felt a little overpriced based on other excellent restaurants in the area.  Although the atmosphere was romantic, I had a hard time reading the menu and the bill using just the votive candle on the table.  There has to be a better way!",

The presentation of the pastas and explanation of them by the server to begin with were very helpful in deciding our main entrees.          The live music I think is what did it for me.  She was amazing and not too loud that we couldn't talk.  The ambiance of the whole place was so romantic.  The only reason why I gave it four stars was because at any restaurant, when ordering a bottle of wine, I've never actually had my glass be empty and had to literally stand up and grab the bottle to pour it for my date and I.  You would think someone would have seen by the second time, and offered to pour it for us.  I'm not beneath pouring my own wine but I'm out to be taken care of.  Oh and the chicken was a bit dry. But other than those two little things, everything else was great.      I'd go back if asked or invited but it's not a place where Id bring up in conversation to go.",

Food is always good. Wine List more than acceptable.  Options on handmade pasta are great. I wish they had more vegetarian options.  They will not allow substitutions on their specials. I wanted one of their hand made pastas with a difference sauce  - the one they offer has lobster on it -  and i dont eat fish. They refused. needless to say thats their choice and with a busy kitchen i can understand. I dont hold them accountable for that.  Their pricing is also great.  $250 for the two of us with drinks... not bad, back in Beverly Hills it would have been $500. Will be visiting this restaurant again and again.",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Props to Marcellino for making all their pasta in-house.  This is really one of the best places to get Italian in the Valley.  The lack of a 5-star review goes to value and comparison to other Italian joints.  It can get pricey here and for a lot of people, the perceived value of this place could be low.  There are other places nationwide that serve handmade pasta for a lower price point for equal to better quality.  I will say, though, that when ti comes to flavored pastas, you can actually taste what the noodle is supposed to be flavored with here, as opposed to some other Italian joints.  On our last visit, coming back to the value issue, we ordered the scallops.  They were delicious.  Perfectly cooked.  The pesto was good.  But these were 3 quite small diver scallops.  Smallest I've seen on a restaurant plate.  Again, nothing wrong with the taste, just a value issue.  We all ordered pasta dishes and every dish came out fine.  A solid al dente, maybe a little on the soft side of al dente, but still had some chew.  Never over-sauced and good balance of flavor.  Their noodles tend to be a little thicker than other places, which is fine, just different.    But compared to Rome, and some places in CA and NYC, can't give these guys 5 stars.  They are pretty good.  The value can be a little questionable, but decent handmade pasta is tough to find in the Valley.",

The courses we ordered were perfectly paired with wine selections. I had the porcini pasta with lobster tail and my better half enjoyed the pappardelle with lamb ragu. These dishes reminded us of our time in Rome, and were truly delicious! I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a high quality dining experience.

The 2 stars were for ambience and live music, everything else was a crashing disappointment.  The bartender was rude.  No other word for it.  He was inattentive, walked by us multiple times without asking for order, refilling water, checking on us.  We waited an hour for our order.  The folks next to us, seated about 20 minutes later, received their bread first.  At this point I was hangry and just wanted to leave.  The bread was dry, and the flavor of the chicken was ok, but the chicken was overdone with too little sauce.  The veggies and potatoes were pretty basic.  Not what we expected from this restaurant, probably won't give it a second chance given all the other excellent choices in Scottsdale.",

But we thought we'd get lucky coming here.   For starters the service was extremely slow and it was a Tuesday night which wasn't busy at all.   The food was extremely pricey for what they offered.     We ordered 4 plates, 2 different pasta plates, lamb and a chicken dish. They were just good, but definitely NOT worth the steep prices, I expected so much more!!   The highlight was a delicious garlicky, red pepper bread spread and the tiramisu for dessert.   Overall wasn't crazy about our dinner experience. Probably won't be returning, considering there's plenty of other Italian options.",

Is it a fine dining restaurant or Walmart? That's a turn off because it's kind of cheap. Any expensive restaurant you go to they all have menu with even numbers. Another turn off was when I saw that they charge $3 for ice. Seriously??? This is embarrassing. They also have only one bathroom which is very inconvenient and it was dirty. For $200 dinner there are much better restaurants out there. We won't come back.",

We were sitting inside then went outside due to how loud the music was and a singer that wasn't the very best. Sitting outside was much better with the heaters on; it was very comfortable. I ordered the Scaloppine Gorgonzola which was very good, thinly sliced veal in a wonderful sauce that came with carrots (that were a little too crunchy), zucchini and broccolini. My husband had the caprese salad which he liked but the roasted peppers were so bitter that he couldn't eat those and after trying myself agreed. I was surprised that they wanted to charge us for the bread but the waiter took it off the bill since they only had a baguette on NYE and he raved on how good the focaccia bread was but then realized they weren't serving it. For dessert we ordered tiramisu which was good with a nice presentation of a flaming sugar cube. Service was good, attentive but not overbearing. What was strange is after our entree the waiter asked if he could bring back our compliments to the chef. We were dumbfounded and taken by surprise no restaurant had ever asked us that before.",

Wife and I had carpaccio, burrata salad, and a wonderful pasta special. By the way, check the prices before you order-- our pasta special was $46 each. It was excellent nevertheless. Service very good even though they are barraged with a continuous stream of tourists. This is a fun place-- enjoy.",

    "text": "I had the privilege of dining at this restaurant because I was given a gift certificate. The dollar amount was quite high so I knew this will be a \"fine dining\" experience - one I probably would not rather pay for. I reviewed the menu and didn't see that the prices were that bad - so I invited my future in laws and future husband. When we got there, the restaurant was cozy and intimate. Right away, the employees were really nice. They asked us if we have ever dined before and we told them \"no\". They gave us complimentary bread and a small meat and cheese platter.   The waiter went over the specials and also brought over a pasta display - these were not on the menu and he had to verbally tell us about each - of which the prices were way more than the pasta dishes on the menu. I couldn't resist despite the prices - maybe it was his voice, the way he detailed the dishes, and the fact there was a display in front of us that made me forget the menu all together and order off of his verbal recommendations: my fubby and I shared the Buffalo Mozzarella for an appetizer, the Porcini Fettucini for an entree and I got the Bellinitini for my drink.  Everything was incredible - even the bread and I normally don't eat bread! When we got the check - for four of us, it was a little less than $200 ($50/person). Thank god for the gift certificate to help pay the bill and the fact that we shared!   Overall, atmosphere = 5, food = 5, service = 5, price = 2. It would be a great place to visit for a special occasion.",

I recently ventured away from the ragu (thanks a lot Lent) and had the tagliolini with shrimp. It was fantastic. All portions are good size and I'd expect to have some left over.

We started with a shrimp & feta appetizer and I could not believe how much I enjoyed it. We then shared 2 half orders of special (off menu) pastas, and the Fagottino di Pollo.

    "text": "Restaurant Week Fall 2015  Terry T and I went here with non-Yelper Julie on Monday, Sept. 21 and had a truly outrageous meal. Everything we ordered was split between the three of us.  We started out splitting the mozzarella and prosciutto, polenta al funghi and scallops con pesto. I ate them in that order, because I knew--while all should be delicious--the scallops would be amazing. And they were, on all accounts. The mozzarella was fresh, served with roasted red peppers and fresh tomato; grilled polenta fries surrounded perfectly sauteed mushrooms; and the scallops were perfectly cooked and rested in the best pesto I've had in my life!  Next course: ravioli del giorno, gnocchi Sorrentina, and filettino al tartufo. Same eating pattern applied here. Three huge (like, the size of my hand) raviolis stuffed with spinach and ricotta [if I'm remembering right] and a brown butter sauce were easily split between our group. The brown butter sauce was a bit understated, but otherwise was a really good dish. The gnocchi--dang, I love gnocchi--were tender and cradled in a delicate tomato sauce. I'm generally not a huge red sauce fan but this was executed wonderfully. Finally, the medium-rare grilled filet was mouth-watering and the Barolo reduction was decadent.  Wrapping up our meal, we ordered two servings of tiramisu and one panna cotta. In hindsight, we'd probably order two panna cotta if we were able to do it again. Not that the tiramisu was divine; it's just we had a harder time sharing the panna cotta. Both were fantastic, I assure you.  We also checked out there non-Restaurant Week offerings and will be heading back for those.",

I took my boyfriend to Marcellino for his Birthday and was thoroughly disappointed in almost EVERYTHING!  First, on a positive note, it is a beautiful location and great atmosphere... Perfect for a romantic date. Second, the negative... I do not know how they managed to make a salad taste bad, but they did... It tasted bitter and bland and lacking any real preparation. Then their pasta... There was no flavor or depth or excitement at all! I don't know about you, but Italian food is supposed to warm you from the inside out and fulfill all your senses from sight to smell and of course taste! When we finished the meal, the waiter asked us how it was, and I told him I really was not impressed and disappointed after expecting something much more. He quickly got defensive and proceeded to quote all the \"awards\" and \"ratings\" they have received and when I mentioned I was Italian, he said the food I was used to but be from a different region. He was rude and un-accommodating.  I have no problem paying $20-$30 per plate, but only if there is quality to back it up. Do not waste your time or money if you are anticipating FABULOUS Italian food, but if you don't mind paying for a nice atmosphere and mediocre, overpriced food, then Marcellino might be your place.",

A good friend took me here on a Monday night and we were greeted by the Italian husband and wife owners and shown all the fresh hand-made pasta specials of the evening.  I chose the crimini infused pasta with crimini mushrooms, truffle oil and....magic!  Caprese salad is the precursor to any italian meal and they have it perfected- adding roasted peppers.  The suggested wine was incredible and the pasta left me speechless!  It tasted just like the night in Rome when my new friend Fiorella took me on her vespa to the \"restaurant where typical italians eat\".  I savored each bite at Marcellino just as I did in Rome!  It is a bit pricey, but worth every cent!  I can't wait to go back!  P.S. I tried to incorporate the genius term \"American Bastardization\" into my yelp like Anne W, but couldn't get it to fit.

I was ready for a drink at the bar and I was looking pretty good so I thought I'd be the vamp at the bar that night.  What a cute restaurant!!  The Bartender was AWESOME and had a shot of Limoncello with us.  We loved him immediately.  We sat down, and our waiter came over.  An older dude that was very sweet and he told us our specials.  We split the Beef Carpaccio and it was very good -- a little low on salt -- but very yummy.    I had the scampi special and my hubby had the Wild Boar Tagliatelli -- yummy but missing something.  My Scampi was really not as flavorful as I would have liked -- but it was good.  You can tell the pasta is fresh and I just love that.  Our waiter left us alone for a long time and didn't check back as often as I would have liked.  At the end, he only brought the dessert tray and did not tell us about all the other ice cream flavors they had.  I had to tell him -- because I heard it from all the other waiters when they told their tables.  Now wassup with that?  Also, we were told by the bartender that we get a complimentary shot of limoncello at the end of our meal.  Never happened.  All the other tables did get one though -- so I think it was just our guy.  There will be a second visit -- and I will make sure we get a different waiter.  I really wanted to love this place and the first visit didn't let me love it",

Not even that tasty.  This restaurant has gone downhill, while the prices have gone way up.  I guess if you like a greasy, heavy, expensive, snobby restaurant, this is your place! Where are the friendly neighborhood Italian restaurants of yesteryear?",

    "text": "Marcellino and Sima are finally back after their yearly 1 month Italy vacation (re-opened September 10th)....and are we glad they are back!    We had a fabulous duo appetizer: fresh fig and prosciutto and the second was a filet (carpaccio) with shaved mushroom and black truffle!  Delicious!  I've always been a fan of prosciutto and melon, but the fresh fig was tremendous!  Marcellino also brought us a fresh black truffle cream for his crusty bread, mmmm, amazing.  I don't think you can get this anywhere (fresh), even here if you ask for it, but we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time!  Pasta duo was tortellini with even more truffles and a wild boar pappardelle.  Best hand made pastas anywhere.  Perfect!  Main course was a perfectly cooked filet with his mashed potatoes and julienned vegetables...and more truffles!  So right...so full!  I'm so glad we had an hour spinning class before embarking on this journey!  We ended up skipping desert and had some left over to go!  What a perfect Italian dinner paradise!  We can't wait to go back for opera night...and of course we are waiting for his next wine dinner.  Best in the valley.",

The service was great - excellent timing on filling water, clearing table - it was all seamless.   Now the food!  Home made pasta, fresh and original. Everything was tempting but I can never resist the specialty of the day - seafood linguini, mushroom sauce, or any other meats - gently cooked!  Perfect!  With a bottle of wine, meal and dessert - it can get pricey but it's well worth it!   They do offer Valentine 'take out baskets' which are reasonably priced (considering) and sound wonderful -i must admit, i have never tried them though.",

    "text": "So this review is a little tardy as we dined at Marcellino's for New Years ... it was spectacular.  The service is top notch, friendly and professional, knowledgeable and prompt - the food was simple and delightfully tasty.   Must admit I am a long time fan, though I don't go as often as I might like as a night out there will set you back a few dimes.  What I relish is the fresh, simple taste of dishes prepared with intention and care - easily the best Italian in Phoenix.  I also love to be greeted and schmoozed by the stunning Sima who always makes you feel welcomed back like an old friend.  I'm going to get back here again soon as every time I dine here I think, why did I wait so long.",

I had the salmon which was very small and bland. Not sure how an Italian restaurant has only one veal dish. The atmosphere is nice with both inside and out dining.",

Sorry AZ, you are on a relative scale.  I was bummed, because I was the only person in this restaurant for an hour and a half at 7 on a thursday night. Finally a good Italian joint in Phoenix and nobody shows-up. I hope this place survives.",

    "text": "When you have grown up loving and appreciating food, and have travelled extensively here in the U.S. as well as abroad, and wanted to dedicate your life to the creative process of preparing food at an early age, and already having lived many decades, it came as a wonderful shock to be so impressed and taken with a local restaurant after eating there for the first time! My daughter and son-in-law gave us a gift certificate last Christmas for Marcellino Restorante located in Scottsdale,  which was about to expire on June 21st.  Couldn't let that happen, so the wife and I decided to go on a Saturday to avoid evening rush hour traffic.  After reading many reviews on Yelp, and in the AZ Republic, I knew it was considered a very good choice for an Italian meal.  Well I have to say it was a very good choice no matter what the cuisine!  During the 48 hour period after we ate there, we constantly had thoughts during the day and dreams during the night about how tasty and wonderful the food was.  We don't think this has ever happened to us before.   The restaurant was classy, attractive and comfortable, the wait staff friendly, knowledgable and efficient, not at all stuffy or obtrusive.  I enjoyed the double layer of linen tablecloths adorning our table. We ordered their special blend of iced tea, a black tea with lavender, apricot and rose hips,  unusally tasty, an uncommon occurance in my experience.  I should have known if I liked the tea so much, the rest had to be exceptional, and it was!  Since their pasta had received rave reviews, and they bothered to bring a large platter of uncooked pastas to the table like many restaurants show off their desserts, we knew we were in for a treat.  We decided to order two pasta dishes,  Gnocchi Sorrentina (described on the menu as \"perfectly light potato/pasta dumplings floating in tomato sauce with fresh mozzarella cheese melting within\", and Tagliolini Mare e Monte (the tomato sauce had small shrimp, tail on, and mixed mushrooms, with lovely little chunks of tomato).  We told our waiter that we were intending to share the dishes and he brought them out with one half of each pasta dish on our plates, pre-shared you might say.  There was an unbeliveable explosion of flavors in our mouths, the pasta cooked perfectly al dente.  We were like two little kids in a candy store, oohing and aahing as we cleaned our plates.  Next followed our one shared entree,  Salmone in Crosta di Porcini e Porri, described on the menu as \"Atlantic salmon dipped in porcini (mushroom) flour and sauted with fresh leeks and cognac\".  Ordered slightly beyond medium, the fish couldn't have been cooked any more perfect!  I am drooling as I write this review, I can't help myself.  The fish was served with semi crunchy sticks of zucchini and fluffy mashed potatos with a little branch of fresh rosemary sticking up like a miniature tree. We continued to hum throughout this meal.  To finish this gastronomic orgasm I had a double decaf expresso and the wife had their blend of decaf coffee and our dessert choice, a chocolate mousse with fresh strawberries topped with whipped cream.  It was unbelievable how each plate outdid the next! Chef Marcellino Verzino greeted us as we were leaving and I told him he was a \"flavor magician\" whose magic will be long remembered.  Until you have eaten here, you haven't really eaten \"real Italian pasta\"!",

    "text": "I have been to Marcellino at least 5 times in the last two years, the most recent visit in October.    The only thing that keeps me from giving Marcellino 5 stars is my spotty experience with the service.  On two occasions it took more than 30 minutes to get a check when we were ready; on another the owner/hostess was condescending.    The food has always been spectaular- 5 stars for the food.  The pasta and fillings are all freshly made.  Among our favorites: Paccatelli al Ragu di Salsiccia- this is one that my daughter has identified as the best Ragu in Phoenix; Gnocchi Sorrentina - the most dreamy-creamy gnocci dish; Lamb Chops al Balsamico- lamb can be sublime or awful- this was memorably sublime.  The salad with the pears and the Ortolana con Gamberi salad are also excellent.  The waiter's service was impeccible at my most recent visit~ attentive, knowledgable, professional and friendly.  I am pleased this was the case as I was hesitant to go because of my previous  experience with the staff.  On one occasion I brought one well-behaved child, on another brought two well-behaved children who enjoy dining.  It was the day I brought two children that I encountered the owner/hostess.  I arrived around 5pm (early- before the usual dinner crowd), and my children behaved perfectly (or I would not have taken them out).  The waiter was charming and attentive, but I felt that the owner/hostess was displeased that I brought children (who at the time were 9 and 10).  I paid full price for all entrees, didn't ask for special kid favors,  tip well and don't dawdle, and the kids were very quiet, so I was rather off-put that I would be be treated with veiled contempt.  I am sure that I will return at some point.  I woud advise the owners to consider tightening up their service, providing checks promptly, treating all guests with gracious respect, putting on the \"make nice\" smile when necessary.  Don't give a \"bum's rush\" to a customer with children who are behaving appropriately.",
