The fresh bread was amazing and I ordered some of the  best linguine with clams I've ever had. My mom had fettuccine with peas, mushrooms and bacon that was to die for. We topped it off with a yummy cannoli. It is apparent that everything is homemade with fresh ingredients. We will definitely be back!",

I could only eat half. But it is all in my refrigerator for later. I liked the garlic bread too and the sausage was good too. All the food was real good and at a reasonable price. I liked the packaging too. They used aluminum foil along with normal styrofoam packaging. Food stayed hot till I got home. The staff is very friendly and very meticulous. I will definitely try other things from Adels italian. Next going to get lasagna. I like this place. Thanks. Bill",

The pesto was creamy and Alfredo sauce was on point! I know because I tried a bite of everyone's meal. The place is small so make a reservation on the weekend just in case!",

Everyone in our party of 9 enjoyed the food.  You must read the descriptions of the foods if you are not familiar with names but all the food we ordered (we got like 6 different dishes) were wonderful.  Personally I had a seafood and cream sauce pasta. So creamy and rich, and the shrimp are cooked perfectly with a snap when you bite into them.  Very fresh too!  This is one of my new favorite places.  The portion as nice and big so I took half of it home as well, which helps with the prices since some of the seafood dishes are like 18 each, the rest are about 13-14.  I also concur with Stephen that this is my new favorite to replace the one that was in Scottsdale. Funny how two random ppl know exactly what place that is! I was so sad when it closed but am so happy I have found a new place that has an even more homely feel!",

But I rather have great food than a fancy restaurant with mediocre food. This one won't disappoint, the food is every bit as good as what I found in the best restaurants in Italy.

After a long day of house hunting on a triple digit Saturday afternoon we stumbled in here fatigued, dehydrated and starving...We needed wine pronto :)  It was pretty deserted so we sat where ever we wanted.  Our waitress was friendly and explained the special soup of the day they had.  It sounded good, so my Husband ordered some.  He said it was pretty good, just piping hot, so he actually waited to the end of the meal to eat it.  For our entrees I ordered the lemon pepper shrimp linguine and he got the chicken parm, but with veggies instead of pasta.  We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals!!  I love shrimp and pasta and this had a great tanginess to it.  Would have been even better with pecorino romano cheese on top, but all they had was the freshly grated parm.  It was still good.  Don't let the sketchy strip mall atmosphere fool ya, this place makes food with authentic TLC.  We'll definitely return.",

Given my background as an educated chef, and professional work in Italy, I tend to walk in to such places with a heightened sense of judgement and criticism. It might not stand out as the most indigenous of Italian environments, but the food speaks for itself. I'm delightfully amazed by the chefs good handle of Italian cuisine as well as presentation. Money well spent on flavorful foods and friendly hands on service.",

I had the Fettuccine Alfredo and my friend had some sort of shrimp pasta.   1. Both of our pastas were overcooked 2. Both of our pastas were underseasoned (her shrimps tasted great though). My dish was bland and hers was overly sour. We pretty much emptied the salt and pepper bottles to compensate for the poor flavor.   The bread was good, though. A hint of garlic on top of warm, soft bread. It tasted really well with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.   Still, I wouldn't recommend this place.",

Our favorite Italian place in Tempe recently closed for good, so we are in search of a new \"go to\" place.  Sadly, I don't think that Adela's will be a suitable replacement.  We ordered one lasagna and one linguine with calamari.  Both dishes lacked flavor and seasoning and the pasta was over cooked with no texture or substance.  I piled on the salt and grated Parmesan, but that only slightly helped.    We were also surprised at the portion size on the lasagna for the price.  It was quite small, but due to the overcooked and under flavored nature, that did not really matter.",

We had fried calamari escargot and side salads before dinner. The calamari was perfect. For dinner we shared gnocchi. Main entree was pasta carbonara chicken parmigiana scampi fra daviola and pollo limone. All were delicious. Dessert was tiramisu and lemoncello mascarpone cake.  Now if I was able to rate the service separate it would be two stars. We sat for a while before we received any water. It took even longer for him to take our wine order. We had to ask for more bread and water during dinner. There was no interaction outside of taking the order and serving it. We didn't know there were any specials until we overheard the same waiter telling the table next to us.  When the service doesn't match the food, it takes away from the positive. Hope they can raise the bar for the service. It's really a shame.",

When we got to Adelas, we were greeted so graciously by Jaime. Right away he made us feel so welcome there. it's like we've known them our whole lives.   3 of us ordered the Chicken pasta dish that is pictured on the menu (sorry forget what it was called). It was delicious. then for dessert we had the cream puffs and tiramisu. was to die for.   Jaime and his father has such great personalities. We DEFINITELY recommend going here if you guys are ever in the area and are looking for great food and a great atmosphere.",

Most of what we find from places like Olive Garden is canned food that taste far from the real thing. Many of the Italian food I have eaten at restaurants is something I come out of the restaurant wondering what I actually ate.  However, Adela's Italian food is something you can taste from the very beginning with the calamari and the sauce it came with it. You can actually taste your food and savor the ingredients. Adela's is truly a wonderful place with wonderful service. The servers there were always on point and right there to tend to our needs. It was truly wonderful.",

My sister ordered the lasagna and we searched and searched, but didn't find the usual ricotta cheese among the layers--she was disappointed. I had the orrecchiette with sausage, and I wasn't impressed with the first few bites, but I eventually thought it was good. My husband had the spaghetti, with meatballs and sausage which he really like, and my brother had the fettuccine alfredo and he too was happy with his selection. I found the decor amusing...it reminded me of glitzy 80s meets Goodfellas, but not in a good way. The owner did come around to chat with all of the patrons, and that was nice, but it isn't enough to make us want to return. We will keep searching...",

Here is how our experience went; we arrived at 745pm, there was ONE other table seated that owner was speaking with, he did not acknowledge us, and a waiter came out 5 minutes later and sat us.   We asked for water. The waiter mentioned that they were out of house wine and would be substituting it with Franzia red wine (from the box), and proceeded to mention that it is the same wine that college students get drunk on and he would recommend a bottle. Why not substitute a better wine for the house wine you are out of??   Bread came out-housemade and good! We asked for water again.  Our wine came out (not Franzia), we asked for water again--still waiting on this.  Our meals arrived and mine was probably the worst eggplant dish I have ever had. The sauce was very good on the pasta, my husband had the chicken parmigiana and said it was average. I asked the chef if this dish was supposed to be this way (as it was really not the same as any other eggplant dish I've had, and he said that was normal).. It was $40 for 2 dishes and one glass of wine without tip.   While we are now the only table in the restaurant, the waiter is NOISILY cleaning silverware and throwing it in the dish pan, and the dishwasher is running in the back, so much for our romantic date night.   Our waters were never refilled, took 15 minutes to get our check--we are the ONLY table in the entire restaurant!   We will not be back and will not recommend this place to anyone.",

My husband and I found the place on Yelp and decided to order take out, so we could enjoy it with some red wine while decorating for the holidays. Unfortunately, the manicotti tasted like a once frozen and then microwaved version and was still cold in the middle. It was awful and essentially inedible. I love manicotti and this one takes the cake as the absolute worst I have ever had. So disappointed. My husbands dish wasn't much better. The bread that accompanied the meal was dry and lacked good flavor. They also failed to put butter in the bag. Very disappointed and a waste of money. Sure wish you could return terrible meals for a refund. Maybe eating in is better but don't offer take out of its this bad.",

We walk in and an older lady greets us and seats us with no menus and walks away. Comes back and asks if we would like drinks and I order an iced t and my sister says water and maybe wine. She goes back inside (we sat outside) and grabs a wine list. Comes back and asks about apps. Leaves, comes back with my tea, asks about wine. Leaves, grabs menus, comes back with bread. Leaves, comes back to take order, leaves, comes back and says she forgot what we ordered. Brings soup, brings salad I never ordered, asks about wine again. Just back and forth and back and forth....I had told her it was my sister's bday but she just dropped off the check, didn't ask us for dessert (not asking for a free dessert but it was her bday, maybe she wanted dessert) which she did. We order dessert and coffee and it comes Togo. Why would it come in a box? So my sis says, can I eat it here? The young man that was a busser, I think, went and got it plated up. Coffee was lukewarm. When we went to pay, the young man asked us how much the tip was going to be so he could put it in the IPad. Just weird. Who does that? The food was very good though. The lasagna tasted like fresh pasta and had great flavor, the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and broccoli was amazing as well as the soup. Spinach and egg in a broth kinda soup. Dessert was tiramisu and cheesecake were both creamy and delicious. I really enjoyed the food. Maybe I'll just keep this place in mind for take out only.",

    "text": "This review is difficult to write because the family is so sweet. But I need to be honest. I went there on a  Saturday night there were only two tables eating. I get it it's a new business.   The decorations are drab. It's an awful blinding white. With some mural on one wall. They have this mirror behind the cash register and you can see in the back. Like zip lock bags and storage things. This is not  appetizing. It's sort of unprofessional. So they have these vintage stools that are terrible.   I ordered to-go. I ordered shrimp and chicken fettuccine  and a Gorgonzola salad it came with garlic bread. I also had a glass of Kendal Jackson.   So let's start with the salad. It was that garden mix that is pre rinsed from Walmart. Terrible how difficult is it to cut some lettuce. There was hardly any Gorgonzola at all. The bread was also generic with no taste at all. I was so disappointed.  The fettuccine was also from the box not fresh made. For $19.00 I wanted if not authentic Italian food at least fresh.  The sauce was decent but defiantly not enough the pasta was dry. The chicken were five pieces of dry chicken breast cubes and beige cut so small. The shrimp were plump and cook perfectly.   So I wouldn't return. When speaking to the mother she said their food wasn't fast food but Olive Garden is far more superior than my experience at this restaurant.",

It's a small family owned restaurant in a strip mall. The first time when I came for dinner one of the owners was our waitress and she was super friendly. The friend who I came here with had been here a few times and the owner was very appreciative that she kept coming back. Funny enough, the family is NOT Italian. I believe they are from Bolivia & Mexico.   The restaurant itself isn't that big, but there's nice artwork on the wall and I liked that there was on open kitchen. They also have a patio. I also appreciated the complimentary bread. Both times I was here it tasted really fresh.   Each time I was here I had a fettuccine dishes. The first time (dinner) I had the Toscana (chicken & artichokes). I LOVED the sauce! It was a creamy marsala, and it was flavorful. The second time (lunch) I had the Paisano (bell peppers & sausage). There was plenty of meat & veggies and I really liked the red sauce.   When I came for lunch I didn't realize Adela's had a separate lunch menu. It looked as if it was a slightly condensed version of the dinner menu with most menu items costing a little less. From what I can tell the portions are the same as dinner. When I came the first time (dinner) I thought they prices were fair, and they are VERY reasonable for lunch.   I'll for sure be back!",

However the last time I went here was on Valentine's Day and they had a few specialty items that were not on the menu. One of those was an osso bucco and it sounded good so I ordered that one. Since it was not on the menu they obviously didn't share the price of the dish but I was assuming it was going to be priced pretty comparable to their other entrees. Well I was pretty upset when I found out the dish was over $40. First off, this dish was not worth that kind of money at all. Their was barely any pappardelle that came with it and I didnt think the meat had that good of flavor. I ended up spending way too much money on this dish and felt pretty ripped off. They do have pretty good complimentary bread before the meal and some of the other entrees that I've tried have been good. I just think they can be very pricey.",

It's not that big and we had to wait since we didn't have a reservation but now I understand why. It was perfect for date-night and the staff was really friendly. They made excellent recommendations based on our preference. For dinner, def call ahead to see if there's a wait or make a reservation. The food is great, I feel like an Italian grandma is cooking everything in the back. Will be back again to try new entrees",

The fact they take reservations is a joke. The ambience is very cheap feeling.  Definitely not a good date spot, which sucks cause I came here to celebrate an anniversary.  When we walked in we should have left but, I thought \"well the reviews were good.  Maybe the food is awesome.\"  It. Was. Not.  Honestly I make better Italian food at home.  Nothing special what so ever.  Portions are are small.   For dinner you get a small lunch portion.  I LEFT STILL HUNGRY.  That should never happen. Especially for how much you pay.  WAAAY OVER PRICED. With all of this being said, the bread was good and the server was super nice.  After we ate we went to another restaurant.  I'm disappointed how much money I wasted.  I work too hard to waste it at a terrible restaurant.",

Saw the positive reviews on Yelp a while back and the restaurant is close to a weekly evening appointment so decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed. The service was wonderful even though we chose to sit on the patio. Every employee we walked passed smiled and said \"Hi\" and our server was friendly, helpful and patiently answered all of our menu questions. The atmosphere was quaint and cozy. The food is a whole other story. The humble surroundings do not prepare you for the phenomenal quality of food you will get at Adela's. I adore Italian food -legit Italian food and this place is the real deal. I literally cleaned my plate - I NEVER clean my plate. To top it off, the chef came out from the kitchen to ensure that we were enjoying our meals. Class act. Great food. Go now.",

Calamari was fresh and crisp with a delicious spicy tomato sauce. We had the Chicken Marconi and Penne All Arrabiata both were delectable and we ate every morsel... All but licked the plate! It seems others haven't discovered this gem because we were the only ones there at 5:00. We HIGHLY recommend giving it a try! We'll be back",

We arrived and were told to seat ourselves them the server kind of ignored us until his Mom came and checked on us. The reviews I read had me really excited and we skipped dinner at our favorite Italian place up the street to give it a try.

I got the eggplant parmagiano. The pasta had a very bland tomato paste flavor and it was kind of watery. The eggplant was soggy. I'm a bit of an eggplant snob since having my girl's mom's eggplant. She makes the best eggplant with pasta. This place breaded it by baking it but didn't fry it. As a result, it turned out extremely soggy. My salad was very good, the garlic bread was tasty. I did get the cannoli. I liked the cannoli because it wasn't too sweet. The service saves this place because the service was really good and they care about taking care of their guests. I had a taste of the lobster ravioli and it was pretty tasty. I would be willing to go back and give this place another shot. I will just stay as faaaaaaaaaaaar away from the eggplant as possible.",

I had read about it on Yelp, saw that it had decent reviews, and suggested we go.     I had the fettucchine della casa with chicken and she had the lasagna.      First, my review of her lasagna.    I am NOT a fan of tomato-based sauces, therefore, that is why I don't order those type of dishes.    She LOVED it.     I thought it was okay.    Tasted like lasagna.   My dish, on the other hand, was good.    I wish it had more chicken, since one has to pay extra for it.    Thankfully, it was not boiled.    UGHHH!     I hate the taste and texture of boiled chicken!   It was either fried or roasted, and was good.   The flavors in the pasta were good.    Not fabulous but good.   My friend wanted to try the desserts.   That's how much she loved her lasagna.   She wanted to experience more of the menu.   We ordered the .   WHOA!!!    Yummmm!!     If it would have been polite, I would have licked the plate.    Jaime, the son of Pedro, the owner, told us everything was homemade, including the desserts.    I will believe it.    I would have liked to have ordered it for my complete lunch or, at least, taken some home, but I could not imagine how many calories it has.     Since we were the only customers in the restaurant, Jaime was able to talk to us.    Father was clearly visible, but didn't come over to say \"hi.\"    Must be shy.    Jaime said the restaurant had only been open three months, and was very busy for the dinner hour.    They are going to have music later.    There are murals on the wall, and he said they were going to have more.    Hopefully, not too much, or the walls will look too busy.     I would definitely like to order the tiramisu to go.    I wonder if I can order a whole cake??    Hmmm",

We only come to Phoenix area once a year and this was our first visit to this wonderful place.  Friendly service.  Family run.  I had the linguini with white clam sauce and I asked for extra garlic.  They obliged!   Husband got the shrimp  fettuccine alfredo and his shrimp were cooked just perfectly.  Our gorgonzola salads with walnuts and balsamic house dressing were very good.  We will be back with family and friends.",

The wine list is limited and the house Chianti might be red vinegar. Friendly service in a neighborhood atmosphere, and it's passable Italian at least, so it gets three stars...but can't do any more than that.",

    "text": "I love Italian food. So I came to yelp looking for an Italian place for a casual lunch with my boyfriend and noticed the good reviews given so far so we agreed to give it a shot. Upon walking in we were greeted by a very friendly, soft spoken man who's service was beyond excellent. I don't remember his name but I really wish I could. As a former server it's hard not to have high expectations while sitting in the guest's seat and he was outstanding, very attentive, timely with refills and checking to make sure everything was tasting great and even came with a clean knife moments after I accidentally dropped mine! As for the food, we were blown away. The bread that is brought to the table is a small sliced loaf served with butter but it is better than any I've ever tasted and is obviously homemade, so soft and warm you'll simply have to ask for another. The chicken cesar salad we shared was not only a great appetizer for two but also just the right amount of dressing on top of the fresh lettuce. As for the entree's, my boyfriend is a bit picky when it comes to Chicken Parm, having tried it at several different places and finally settling on the fact that his own is the best it's going to get. However, Adela's dish was amazing enough to change his mind. From the kind of pasta that was used, the thinly sliced chicken, the flavorful sauce and the perfectly filling portion size, the meal was on the plate one minute and gone the next! As was mine, the Scampi al Lemone. I adore all sorts of seafood but shrimp is a favorite, so scampi is a dish I'll chose more often than not when given the opportunity. And let me say, this scampi was top of the charts by a long shot. No additional lemon is needed to get the perfect favor because it's already there, the shrimp are thoroughly cooked and stay jumbo as advertised and the sauce is just so amazing it's impossible to forget. Hence the reason we came back several weeks later, hungry for another extraordinary dining experience and were not disappointed in the slightest. I have and will continue to recommend Adela's to friends looking for great food and better service, I only wish 10 stars was possible.",

It was not very crowded for Friday lunch time, we ordered and I received eggplant parmigiana and it was soggy and cold and tasted terrible.  No crispness, nothing.  I told the waiter and he said if remade it would be the same bc of the cheese and sauce!!  Not sure how since should of been crispy to start and baked in an oven, but whatever.  The sauce tasted ragu like and so I didn't want a different meal so I decided to eat tiramisu, I think it would of been good if it did have the refrigerator taste.  Overall not a great dining experience!",

You can sit outside but since it was windy we sat inside.  The place is small but cozy.  I went to restroom to wash hands. ( I feel you can tell alot about a restaurant by the cleanliness of there restrooms.)  The restroom was very clean We were greated by James the owners son.  Very nice young man.  My friend and I wanted salads each ceasar salads he suggested we split one since they are large which we did.  The lettuce was fresh and very crispy, just the right amount of dressing too, not to much not to little.  Salad was excellent.  The bread they bring out was something I had never tasted before, did not taste like french bread nor sourdoe but it was very good and fresh .  James also brought out olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping.   I had the Manicotti.  I cant believe how good it was.  The pasta actually melted in my mouth.  I have never had this good of pasta in my life and I dont think I can eat it anywhere else.  It was not to thick or thin with just the right amount of the cheese stuffed inside and the sauce was not to sweet or too tomatoe. There also was fresh Pharm on table.  Not from a shaker can.   I will go back just for the great pasta.   You can tell this was all homemade My friend had the Chicken artichoke pasta.  She could not stop eating it too.  She said the flavors were excellent.  lots of fresh chicken and she loved the pasta she knew it was fresh.   We did not have dessert we were to full but Im sure there desserts would have been fantastic. we will have on next visit. My friend could not wait to tell her daughter about this place so they could try it.   James did an excellent job with everything.   I yelp alot and this place is defiently a 10 stars.  If your reading this do yourself a favor try this place. Reasonable prices, good soft music playing, comfy.  you wont be sorry",

They bring tasty, thin sliced bread before the meal. My lasagna was good, but maybe not as good as it's price tag (over 15$). The husband's gnocchi in a pink sauce were amaaaazing. I would recommend that over the lasagna for sure. On top of that, we had to try the tiramisu. Their tiramisu was HUGE and tasty and we ate all of it because we are sick humans. This may not be my first choice for Italian in Phoenix, but I would come back.",

The brownie was OK. It tasted very dry or maybe slightly overcooked. The chocolate sauce was Hershey's syrup. The ice cream was store-bought vanilla and it was freezer burnt.

We'd read great reviews before selecting Adela's and were not disappointed. The food was incredibly delicious. My companion had a spicy shrimp pasta dish and I had the pollo Limone the first visit. Both were melt-in-your-mouth spectacular. We ate the lemon cake for dessert. He loved his dishes and my entree and dessert were the best Italian I've ever eaten. The bread was fresh and exceptional.   We enjoyed our first dinner so much that we came back on the last day of our vacation to try other menu items. We were greeted warmly by the owner-chef and we chatted with his beautiful wife. Their son, Javier, was a gracious, welcoming, and enthusiastic host once again. It's an inspiring family business fueled by a passion for service and great Italian food! I ordered fettuccine Alfredo and my companion ordered a vodka pasta dish he truly loved. Both of us were again blown away by the fresh ingredients and spectacular flavor - we wholeheartedly agreed that this was the best Italian ever. Our dessert was their terrific tiramisu. We wish we could visit regularly. We'll return next trip.",

The simple sophistication of the interior is very relaxing. All the staff from the chef to the busboy are family or close friends. They make you feel like you are dining in their home.  Meals start with complimentary homemade bread. They usually have a few daily specials the server will tell you about. The menu has a large variety of various pastas & sauces, as well as traditional Italian dishes. They are happy to customize your order on request. A side salad with an entree is only $1.99...a great addition to your meal. Save room for dessert because they have some sweet options.   I've never had a bad meal here & I've tried quite a few things. Even venturing outside my comfort zone & I've always been pleased. I highly recommend you give Adela's a try.",

It was definitely not. I added cayenne pepper myself. Ate it all though.  Bread: good  Cheesecake: delicious.

We've never had any issues with them but they do get a bit annoying.  The owner is a very sweet woman, makes you feel like you're chatting with your Italian grandmother. Very inviting and welcoming.

The manocitti, gnocchi, chicken lemon dinners were equally a 10.  The tiramisu was the real deal. Hot bread brought to the table with beautiful greens for salad preparation.

We started off with the Caesar salad which was good, standard as far as salads go. We also got bread and butter which was really good, the bread tasted fresh.   For dinner, I ordered the penne all' arrabbiata with chicken. It was very good! Spicy, but not too much, and the sauce was very tasty. My boyfriend ordered the pollo Marconi, which is kind of like a chicken Marsala tomato cream sauce. The sauce was so good!! We couldn't get enough. The rest of the chicken and everything was very good as well.   Overall we were very happy with our meal and thought it was delicious!",

But in the end, the food was fresh, flavorful, and \"real\" Italian food. We will definitely be coming back regularly.  Our waiter, who was the son of the cook (who i assume owns the restaurant) was great and had good recommendations.  We ordered a Caesar salad as our appetizer, the Penne All' Arrabbiata with sausage and Scampi Fra Diavolo with Tiramisu as our dessert. The salad we learned, used a house made Caesar dressing, was incredibly flavorful but the presentation could have been better. The entrees were great, tasting like the dinners I had growing up in an Italian household. Portions were of adequate size, not overwhelmingly large, and not small. The tiramisu was also authentic, light, and delicious.  Overall, this is a hidden gem in Arcadia. Its not fancy, which makes it a nice casual choice for dinner, and the pricing is about average to a little high. Our bill, without alcohol, was just under $50. I will be back soon!",

My brother and I enjoyed it as well.The food was delicious and a good combination of traditional Italian fare served along with some other interesting entrees. I feasted on the Pollo Marconi which consisted of a chicken breast layered with slices of tomato, mushroom, eggplant, ham and cheese, baked in a tomato Marsala cream sauce. It was HEAVEN. My brother enjoyed the veal in lemon sauce and my mom ordered the pasta with shrimp. There was even FRESH baked bread. Our server Jaime was wonderful as well and as a treat he served my mom the most delicious Tiramisu in honor of her birthday. If we lived closer this would definitely be a favorite of ours.  It is located in a strip mall but once you open the doors you are transformed to a some fine Italian dining at the most reasonable price.  Don't miss out on this gem of a place.",

The shrimps were huge and delicious. The sauce was a little lemon-y to my liking but I wouldn't fault that to chef.. I just don't normally order that type of sauce. Bread came out warm and tasty. I liked that the portions weren't so big that you had to take it home.. My fiance and I brought our appetites and both finished our dinners.   No complaints! My only suggestion would be lower lighting to add to the already pretty casual ambience.. The bright lighting reminded me of eating somewhere fast food.",

Your meal start with warm, crispy, homemade bread; followed by a salad with a homemade dressing. The salad greens are fresh and crisp and the dressing delicious and the bread is to die for.  Our entrees were served  and it was one of the most tasteful meals I have enjoyed. Everything is freshly prepared by the owner.

The friendly service is top notch and it has a nice simple ambiance to accompany the fine dishes.  Adela's gives you fresh baked warm bread and butter to start off your dining experience.The lobster Raviolis are my go to dish and are made with pasta from Italy, submersed in a delicious creamy sauce that blows any expensive chains sauces away.  I have not explored much more of the menu because of this but will update as I do.I highly recommend this restaurant and will continue to enjoy several fine dinners there for years to come.",

With all of the great reviews, I had pretty high expectations. I love Italian food and was very looking forward to it.   I must say, I am very surprised by all of the 5 Star reviews. Our service and food were both average. We were served drinks and then bread, but weren't given napkins/silverware. We waited quite a bit, then had to ask for them.  Although my husband loved the bread, I thought it was ok. The texture was more of a regular type bread vs. an Italian style bread. We ordered the Chicken Piccata, Spaghetti & Meatballs and the Baked Ziti. Maybe it was our choices, but there was nothing special about them...and priced $15-$20 each, I thought there would have been. Chicken Piccata usually has an oil based sauce and this was a cream base sauce. Not what I expected.   I definitely don't mind paying for great food, but I just don't feel this was worth what we paid. There are better, more traditional Italian restaurants in the valley that are worth this price point. Glad we tried it though and can check it off the list.",

The server even asked if the fan above us was too cold or not- definitely attentive to details. We had the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and I'm not one for appetizers usually but omg these were to die for! The wine sauce they were soaked in was spot on! My boyfriend had the seafood linguine special of the day and he was beyond satisfied. Lots of clams, calamari, octopus, and mussels. There were a few vegetarian options but I was craving a pasta with white wine sauce. The server said they could make whatever I wanted so I got a vegetable linguine with lemon/garlic wine sauce. Just writing this review is making my mouth water. Loved the entire dining experience here. I highly recommend it!",

We came in with a large group and they so graciously moved tables around so we could all sit together. The food was amazing, I was eating their sauce with a spoon and their gnocchi was the best I've ever had. It was so smooth and not pasty or chewy like gnocchi can be. The manicotti melted in your mouth and the cheesecake was delicious! You could taste in every bite that the food was fresh and homemade and prepared with care and pride. The manager took special efforts to make sure all were satisfied. Every single one of us was extremely pleased and I got much praise from my family for picking such a great restaurant!",

There were only 5 mushrooms but they were delicious in a white wine sauce. My bf had a Vitello alla Sorentino and he liked it but thought the portion was small. I had the Linguine ai Calamari Luciana and I thought it was good portion. The calamari was cooked nicely, not rubbery at all. My only complaint was that the sauce was too watery and the sauce didn't stick to the pasta. It was supposed to be spicy but it wasn't at all to me. I'm glad we took the chance to try the restaurant out.",

I was thrilled when I realized that just a few miles away was Adela's Italian Restaurant! There were tons of great reviews (a solid 4.7 rating), and I really thought I'd found something special. We made our way over expecting to get a great meal, but unfortunately we quickly found out otherwise.  The waiter glowed when asked about his menu recommendations; \"everything is great, but recommend the Linguini Alle Vongole (Baby Clams In a garlic white wine sauce served over a bed of linguini) and the beef lasagna is the best in town!\", so we went with it and ordered... the disappointment ensued. It took them like 7 minutes to serve our meal. The lasagna looked like a Stouffer's Lasagna from the Fry's frozen food section, and the Baby Clams looked like they had been netted out of a can.... they meals looked awful and tasted even worse. They looked microwaved but I can't be certain about that, and the baby clams tasted like sand and dish water... the only thing I liked was the bread. The reviews were NOT ACCURATE!!! If you want real Italian food avoid this restaurant (Chef Boyardee is more Italian).",

    "text": "Funny story how I ended up at this place. Everyone was (technically still) talking about Mora's and I was one of those fatties who was dying to try it as well. The parents suddenly wanted dinner, so I immediately jumped on the mooch train and thought that this was my one opportunity to go to Mora's with my broke behind. Plot Twist: Parents told me that I was paying because ... well, just because they said so.   So, with literally just an hour before dinner, I searched on Yelp nearby for a waaay cheaper Italian option because that's the kind of daughter I am. Adela's came up on my radar and I couldn't believe where it was because it's kind of in a sketchy plaza where I used go pick up my late night chicken wings/crack snack. Definitely don't remember it being there but it is tucked away in the corner so look twice.   This is a no frills mom and pop place. No fancy decor, no fancy bathroom and no fancy servers. It's a pretty small place, but when I got there the place had 3 large groups so I knew I had stumbled upon something great. My favorite Italian dish is Fettuccine Della Casa but I'm always hesitant to order it. A lot of places tend to treat it like it's alfredo. It's not supposed to feel as heavy and the sauce is supposed to be thinner and more delicate. I gave it a try here and oh mi Dio, I made out with that plate, no shame. Portion sizes are pretty hefty so it wasn't a pretty sight either. It was so creamy and the peas, mushroom and bacon help greatly to cut the never-ending carbs you're inhaling. If you're a starving human being, order the Chicken Parmesan. That chicken is as thick as a pork chop and covered most, if not all, the spaghetti under it. For the size of it, it was surprisingly juicy. We ordered a veal dish as well and I recommend you try it here if you've never tried this cut before. In no way was it dry nor rubbery like it usually is as it is one of the leanest cuts of beef, but doused in marsala and mushroom it evolves into a tender and indulgent meal not to be missed.   Let me tell you what a find this is. Not only did we happily waddle our way out with bellies so full it would have made Weight Watchers keel over and die, my wallet was doing a celebratory dance as well. Free table bread, 4 beers, 1 side salad, 3 big entrees, and 2 desserts: $80-something with tax included.   Honestly, I'm in no rush to try out Mora's anymore or any of the other hipster Italian places that keep popping up, no matter the hype. I'm quite content with this gem I found and I hope you will too. If you have the time, look up the story of the chef/owner and how this place came to be, it's pretty heart-warming to read.",

The veal Parmesan was again less than par. The service was okay and the staff was very nice but forgetful. Waiter said he wails bring bread and forgot. The wine list is very limited and selection is not vast or good. Overall, not sure if they had a bad night in the kitchen or people who rated this place 4/5 don't know Italian food.

It is a family owned restaurant, where dad was cooking, son was serving,... They have a nice outdoor patio to sit at and it's small enough where everyone seats themselves.   They start the meal off with garlic bread that is fresh from the oven.  My husband and I both ate off of the specialty menu for the evening. I had the lobster ravioli in a vodka cream sauce, that had large bits of shrimp mixed in.  He had the beef ravioli in a marinara sauce. He was concerned when he first saw that there were so few on the plate, but by the end of the meal we were quite content.    It was a little pricy ($44 for a glass of wine and 2 entrees) and service slightly slow, but it was nice not to feel rushed. We will definitely be back.  This was the first Italian place in the area that we have found that isn't hipster or overly hyped.  Wonderful job!",

    "text": "We were looking for a great Italian place to take the place of our favorite, now closed, La Calabria. Based on the reviews I thought we might find it.   Unfortunately, we didn't.   While it wasn't bad, it was OK. And if I want just OK, there are plenty of places. I do like that it's a small family restaurant and Chef Pedro comes out to greet the tables, but the food didn't live up to what we've come to expect of great Italian restaurants.   The special of Shrimp and Salmon in a vodka sauce was overwhelmed by the salmon with no real punch in the sauce.   The puttanesca flavors didn't blend well and the house salad was lettuce with two grape tomatoes.   Props for friendly service.   While it wasn't horrible it's too far for us to drive for average food.",

The meat sauce (aka \"bolognese\") is like Chef Boyardee - not a lot of meat, smells kind of like Hunt's tomato sauce, very acidic and simple.  Not very good at all.  We got the gnocchi which were gigantic and mushy bits of different sizes.    The shrimp fettucine was actually decent, though I'm sure I can make something at least as good at home.  I was pretty disappointed to waste an outing on this place.  Even the bread was oddly dense, almost like rice cake but not quite?  Very odd bread, unlike anything I've ever tried.",

The freshly baked bread was also a delicious treat, served warm with garlic butter. For my entree, my choice was perfect: the Fettuccine Primavera was presented with properly cooked noodles served in a delightful white cream sauce and topped with a sauteed fresh vegetable medley that was neither soggy or too crisp... just right! For desert, the Spumoni (with a hint of rum) was quite refreshing on that hot afternoon. Also, it must be said that the owners were very friendly, attentive to detail, and shared some pleasant conversation. I will definitely return to this nice establishment!",

The menu is replete with seemingly endless options from simple pasta dishes to elaborate entrees. It was a difficult choice.  They have many genuine dishes that rarely appear on other Italian menus.   I opted for the homemade Manicotti which was absolutely delicious. Their pasta is made on the premises and it's obvious from its smooth texture and freshness.   Everyone in our party of 6 were equally pleased with their dinner selections. We started with bruschetta and calamari both of which were exceptional.   Service was very friendly and very attentive.

The food was excellent and the atmosphere was casual and yet respectable. This is a small restaurant located in a small shopping \"strip-mall\" with plenty of parking. Service was great, prices were reasonable, and the food was really really good..... just what I wanted: good Italian \"home-cooked\" food! I had the Fettuccine Della Casa and my wife had the Meat Lasagna. wonderful food!",

Now you should really like calamari to order this because it is not fried to an unrecognizable food that could be anything...zucchini, cheese, a shoe.  I really liked the spicy marinara it was served with as well.  My husband had the baked ziti of which there was little left.  I had the special of lobster ravioli.  Really good, although I was surprised there were shrimp on top.  The server did not mention that.  But when I overheard another server, I realized we got the abridged version of the specials in general.  But she was very nice and attentive.  And the tiramisu was very good as well.  Will definitely return.  Maybe tomorrow in fact!",

The main course was absolutely dreamy if a person likes Italian they will love this place, it was just wonderful. The lemon chicken was terrific it disappeared quick. The other dish was chicken in a cream sauce with bacon and peas magic in the mouth! Finished with coffee and a chocolate brownie that was not ordinary by any standard.

It was served with a fantastic little loaf of garlic bread. The best part was how reasonable the price was. The whole meal was an amazing experience!",

There were huge chunks of lobster in the ravioli and the sauce was creamy yet light and extremely flavorful. Our meal came with fresh homemade bread with butter. The place was busy for a Saturday night but the chef came out to greet some guests celebrating a birthday. Atmosphere was cute and well drinks and domestics were super cheap.

We eat at a lot of restaurants (specially Italian) and all I can say is WOW!!!! Besides the incredible service the food was AMAZING!  We come to AZ for different events specially car auctions so we will make it a point to stop at this great family owned and operated establishment! Our waitress gave us great advice on what to order and was so sweet! Gnocchi w pink sauce melted in your mouth! The spaghetti and meatball had a great flavor to the sauce! The chicken soup w spinach was very flavorful and fresh! We also got the veal and raviolis - all so yummy!!!! It's close to Thoth freeway so if your driving nearby it is well worth the stop!!! They are super accommodating as well!!! Best food Ana service I've had in a long time!",

It typically isn't on the menu but it is always great when it's available. The incredible food is matched by the warm and welcoming (not to mention fast and knowledgeable) staff. Six stars!",

We've been here twice and both times it's been very quiet which we've really enjoyed.  It reminds me of a good family style east coast Italian neighborhood restaurant.  We had the eggplant rolls (can't remember the actual name) and the chicken parmesan.  Both were delicious and cooked to perfection.  We indulged with terramisu for dessert.  Yum!  Just the right amount of coffee.  All in all this place is a winner.  Come see for yourself.",

    "text": "We have been searching for a quaint Italian restaurant in this or any area to replace our long time favorite that used to be in Scottsdale, but has long since closed.   This is how we happened upon this charming little establishment. It's not the most ornate, nor the most elegant of restaurants; but it certainly has a charm of its own.  For appetizers, I ordered the Escargot. Having tasted some of the very best Escargots in many countries, I didn't have very high expectations. However, I was in the mood for snails for some reason.   For the main course, my wife ordered the Penne All' Arrabbiata, and I ordered the Pollo Primavera.   First the Escargots. As expected, they weren't the best that I had ever had, but they were passable. Their flavor wasn't distinct enough, and they were a little bit overdone.   However, both our main courses had wonderful flavors. The chicken, and especially the sausage on my wife's meal were just wonderful.  The cream sauce on my Pollo Primavera was distinct, but it did not overwhelm the taste of the chicken.   The portions were fairly large, and we were only able to consume half of our meals. Our server was so concerned that we didn't enjoy our food, and we had to allay her concern but simply stating that the food was marvelous - there was just so much of it, not that we were complaining.   It certainly was a gem of a restaurant worth discovering!",

It's a small place and the location is unsuspecting. It was almost hidden or tucked in a strip mall corner.   The service, the bread, the balsamic vinegar and olive oil were all good. But the main dish, was ok. I ordered the linguini alle vongole and the clams were a bit over cooked. Most Italian restaurants I've been to where I've ordered the same or similar dish, the clams are usually still in the shell. That's when I can tell the freshness. But, I suspected their clams were probably canned clams.   I have no plans in eating here in the near future.",

We enjoyed a nice meal of classic Italian dishes in this family run restaurant. Apologies for not knowing the son's name, but he was very cordial to us throughout our meal from offering specials when we arrived to conversing about our stay before we left.  The restaurant was easy to find with no difficulty parking out front. We were seated immediately at our 6 PM reservation in the small dining room consisting of about 8 to 10 tables and a short bar. It was a casual and comfortable atmosphere. Bread was brought out shortly with waters that were never empty throughout the meal. The menu is simple with specialty, chicken, veal, and seafood dishes.  For my entree, I enjoyed the chicken picata with a juicy chicken breast that was lightly breaded in an lemon sauce with capers that also covered the spaghetti on the side. The portion was a bit on the small side for $14.95 but still satisfying. Also ordered was the baked ziti ($11.95) and the special for the evening which was the linguine and clams with a red sauce ($17.95). My daughter split the fettucine all' alfredo ($12.95) with her friend and they were nice enough to split the portion into two separate plates. All meals were finished completely with no complaints. I do wish they served their entrees on hot plates, they were room temperature at best.",

We were welcomed into this (quite small) spot hidden in a two-story strip mall.  It was packed, despite being in the middle of the week, so clearly we were in good company in knowing of Adela's!  Each of us ordered something different, though we started out with the stuff mushrooms that luckily I, being the birthday girl, got to have an extra -- so yummy and so decadent (we're talking about butter sauce, ya know!).  My entree was pollo al limone which was super yummy, my bf had the simple aglio e olio, which he devoured, and my parents also enjoyed their entrees thoroughly.  Being my birthday, we were also treated to a dessert - I believe I selected the tiramisu which we liked as well.  Our server was attentive  and provided a great wine recommendation based upon the picky people at the table's tastes (that'd be me and my mom), and also ensured it would complement our meals.  All in all, a fantastic meal thanks to the charming staff and cooks at Adela's!",

We loved the wine we ordered that we ended up buying a bottle to take back home.  The restaurant is very cute and very reasonably priced.",

The service is friendly and open. I will definitely have dinner there again when I am in Phoenix. I don't write many reviews, but I needed to write this one.",
