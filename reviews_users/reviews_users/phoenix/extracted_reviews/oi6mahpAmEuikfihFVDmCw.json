I had porkchops and egg breakfast with a single pancake. Meal was great eggs were perfect and biscut was so soft and flakey. Pancake was WAY bigger than I thought and kind of regretted getting now since I couldn't finish it. My only bad thing was the porkchop was a little tough for my tastes but still tasty. My boyfriend had the jalapeno alfredo that has to be the best thing on the menu. Delicious! You get the creamy alfredo taste immediatly then this slow addition of the jalapeno taste. I didn't think it was spicy but my boyfriend was sweating so if u order it it may be different based on your spicy level.  Our waitress was really nice and the entire staff there is so inviting. I watched I think who was the owner make rounds and chat it up with everyone. Groups of people there were addressed by name so they must be regulars. I hope to become one as well. Thanks for the lovely breakfast!",

Imagine, someone actually smiling while they look you in the eye. Is it 1981? My wife, nicknamed \"Cheekiebaby, tried their biscuits and corn beef hash and she said, \"it was definitely made from scratch and it isn't greasy.\" I had the breakfast sandwich which hit the spot.  So much so it kept me silent for several minutes while I ate. I also ordered a pancake to go along. Hey, don't criticize, I'm writing reviews as a public service! Moving forward, the pancake was delicious. It came with warm syrup and creamy butter. One thing I noted is that the pancake is dense. That's okay with me, but it'll fill you up. For those wanting pancakes to mirror their fashionable cousin the crepe, you may want to have just one pancake or choose something else. Biscuit's pancakes ain't nothing to be messed with. Much like the no nonsense, quasi Midwestern feel I get from the restaurant's decor, these pancakes are will get the best of you if you're not ready for some serious eats. I'm looking forward to exploring the menu on other occasions and maybe next time I'll come ready for two pancakes.",

If you don't know what to get...I highly recommend the chicken fried steak, their home cooked gravy is what seals the deal on this one, same goes for their biscuits and gravy.  Now if you make it around the lunch time...I recommend the steak sandwich! The meat is nice and tender and full of flavor....I can't speak for the other dishes....but this place is definitely worth a shot!!!",

Then we waited for the waitress to come back and take our order for a while. Then we received our food and it wasn't as good as I was expecting. I got the Eggs Benedict with country potatoes. It all had a pasty taste and was really just not good. Then it took forever for the waitress to come back to ask how everything was and just to check on us. Then took forever to get the bill for us to even be able to pay. That will probably be the only money they get from us. We should have made the drive to Scottsdale to go to Butters!",

I ordered the biscuit plate which included biscuits and gravy, eggs, meat and grits. Like a lot of places I've noticed recently the portions are huge, so unless you have giant sized appetite I'd advise sharing the meal.  My food was warm and had a homemade taste to it. My waitress was less than friendly, but I chalk that up to maybe she was having a bad day.  When we finished eating the owner (I think) came by and asked if everything was ok because he saw I only ate half of everything but I assured him the food was good but the portions were just so large.  If you want a homemade breakfast this is the place for you. My breakfast for two was about  $30.00.",

The sauce was extra buttery and lemony the way it should be.  And oh my gosh, THE PANCAKES were amazing!!!!  I asked our waitress to bring whipped cream to put on top and wow, not a crumb was left on my plate.  Interestingly, I didn't feel the biscuits and gravy were anything above average, though they were very fresh and True to form.  I must mention that the hash browns were the most perfectly cooked I've ever had in my life, not too soft and not burnt too crispy, they were just right.      We also ordered take out for dinner and this was a very good idea.    We had Chicken-A-La-King and Meatloaf that evening at home.  Both were very homemade tasting and delicious. Best meal I never cooked.   Please be aware that Biscuits is only open until 2 p.m.    This is a very cute and comfortable place, decorated like a farm house and comes highly recommended.",

The clam chowder was ok but tasted like a canned soup I could buy at the grocery store. We ordered the catfish. It was the worst fish I have ever tasted in my entire life. It had the texture of boogers when you ate the fish by itself. The breading was overwhelming and when removed the fish was even more terrible on its own. The fries were of poor quality, tasting like fast food fries. We left without even finishing our meals. We were disappointed and grossed out the rest of the night by our experience. Will not go back for fish fry ever again and will not recommend to others!",

Once seated we requested coffee and were served the typical watered-down diner type coffee. I ordered my typical cheese omelette with hash browns and got a decent omelette it was okay.

Biscuits has sort of a country themed menu so there weren't a whole lot of items that appealed to me (I am not a chicken fried steak / biscuits and gravy kind of girl). I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was pretty good. I mostly liked it because it was not super greasy. Hubby ordered the steak and eggs and was happy with his food as well even though he said it was pretty bland. I would agree, this place definitely servers basic home-style food without a lot of variety of flavors or spices. On the plus side we did finish our meal with a slice of apple pie and that was very good.  The service was just ok. Our waitress was friendly but we had to ask for silverware and after a coffee spill it took a while to get someone to come over and help (I would have been happy to clean it up myself but again we were not given napkins until after our food arrived). This mom and pop place had some unique seasonal decorations up by the hostess stand but the rest of the place was pretty boring and run down. I'd eat here again if I was close by but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",

I've had the eggs benedict, and the huevos rancheros - both were very hearty and filling, but didn't stand out as exceptional among similar fare at other breakfast places.   Where this place shines is in the biscuits (imagine that). It seems that the dishes I order never come with them, but luckily our client doesn't like to eat his (imagine that).   Their biscuits are crispy, flakey, light, and buttery, with a slightly moist center. They are golden in color and rich in buttery, savory flavor. I want one right now.   It's likely that we will continue coming here for sometime to meet our client, so maybe I'll see you here one of these mornings!",

    "text": "We are visiting the area from Texas and were excited to try this place out. It was a Tuesday morning, nothing special... Really nothing special. Coffee was so weak I thought based on the color that it was weak tea. The omelette wasn't particularly appetizing, the buttermilk pancakes quite heavy and the grits... What in the absolute what? I didn't even try them, there were layers of hard spots and runny parts under the way too thick 'skin' and I was positive it was actually a bowl of botulism.   That brings us to the biscuits themselves... Well, if you are going to name your place after this relatively simple bread then you'd better at least get it right. Not the case. Neither fluffy nor flaky, the odd tasting biscuits were just unpleasant. If you'd like a better biscuit please see the Pillsbury tubes at your local grocer.  In short I recommend just making yourself a bowl of cereal, I'm a fan of Crispix myself.",

Growing up both my grandmother's used to make homemade biscuits and gravy, best part of any weekend morning. This place reminded me of my childhood. The portions are huge. Everything is fresh, for example the eggs are farm fresh, you can taste the difference. The gravy is to die for, it has the creamy peppery taste. The bacon is the perfect texture, it had that crisp but chewy texture. Then there's the biscuits. If you include a food item into the name of the restaurant it better be amazing,  and it was. They were so fluffy and delicious. You will definitely see me again.",

This restaurant just opened recently so I can excuse some of the server's inadequacies, however the mediocre food not so much. Their house omelet with just plain cheese is $6.79, if you want anything more it's $0.85 for a meat to be added or $0.65 per vegetable, not great pricing for a simple omelet. I received my breakfast in 2 stages (weird) and didn't get a biscuit, the bite that I took of my companions was more than enough! This place is definitely for the older crowd, it's Ahwatukee so that's fine, but a restaurant shouldn't just cater to that demographic. I won't be returning.",

All waitstaff very pleasant and friendly.  Food arrived quickly--right on the borderline between lukewarm and cold--but we were hungry and they were busy so we didn't send it back.  Their famous biscuits were exactly like the food-service items we had in the Army--pre-crafted from processed dough on their own tray and only required the cooks to put them in the oven for 15 minutes.  Sausage gravy was store-bought and tasted like congealed fat mixed with cornstarch.  Ordered the Meat Lover's plate with grits and eggs over-medium.  Eggs came over-easy, grits were salty.  The Portuguese sausage was tasty--but they only gave me 5 1-inch diameter ovals of meat.  The ham measured 3\" x 4\" (if that) and was cold.  Needless to say, I was still hungry and this sparse plate cost around $10.  My wife liked her Eggs Benedict and country potatoes.  We split a Champion Pancake order.  Almost $10 for 2--but I think it was worth it.  Whole wheat cakes loaded with granola and fresh fruit items.  The best thing we had for breakfast--and, I think, the only thing that was freshly-prepared.  15% Military discount brought final tally to $35 before tip.  I was really not a big fan, but my wife said it was worth it for the pancakes.  Not sure if we'll be back.",

    "text": "I haven't heard much about Biscuits good or bad I just know they moved into the space that use to be \"Chuy's in Ahwatukee\" The entrance is on the side of the building.  We were greeted by the hostess promptly and sat within a few minutes of arrival. We sat in on what use to be the porch side of Chuy's and it felt a little like the lending tower of Pisa. Their menu has plenty to pick from; Biscuits, Pancakes, French toast, Eggs, Omelets, Burritos, the usual breakfast fare.   Biscuits come with practically everything and they were small but fairly good. I had pancakes and they were huge but tasteless. Maybe a topping would have helped. Topping is extra and for $6 for 3 pancakes and $2 for topping that seemed a bit much for a meatless meal. My spouse had an omelet with spinach, bacon and onions and that also got to be a bit pricey with all the add ons. We also got a side of turkey sausage...maybe we should have just passed on this one. Home fries are very tasty with peppers and onions. Our friend had the biscuits and gravy and said they were fairly good. But not close to the southern style they were hoping for. The coffee was good. The iced tea was fresh brew. They sit carafes of your beverages on the table as to not have you wait for refills or so the waitress doesn't have to ever come back. The service was slow at first and then non-existent. We had to practically trip the waitress to get our check.   Biscuit's is not a chain restaurant. (A good thing). It was clean and the front enclosed patio area is very bright, cheery and a slight lean to the right. The restrooms where clean but ONE stall so \"do what you got a do and get out!\" The business is new and I'm sure they will work out the kinks. They are now serving Dinner, Friday-Sunday. Perhaps I will venture in for dinner in the future.",

Now, the reason for my two star rating.........MANDATORY 20% TIP!  So the waitress was going to get a good tip no matter what.  We paid some cash and some debit cards.  The waitress came back to tell us we were 83 cents short ...........REALLY?   We all had to scramble in our purses, digging for change while she stood there and patiently waited for her 83 cents.

I ordered the Biscuits omelette which defaults with cheese. You can add a number of different mix-ins like green peppers, tomatoes, ham, bacon, spinach, etc. It also comes with a generous helping of either hash browns or loaded country potatoes. And, of course, top it off with a biscuit.  Every dish we ordered looked great. There happened to be a couple mistakes with ours, like accidentally bringing out an extra side bacon when we asked for hash browns. Though, if you ask me, that's not even a problem! After checking her notes, our waitress took the charge off our bill.  In case you're wondering, Biscuits is a locally owned operation, unlike Biscuits Cafe, a chain from Portland, OR. Honestly, both are very good, and just the ticket to any successful brunch!",

We arrived to find they have a huge parking lot, and it was full! Got inside to be told it would be 30 minutes, but actually only took 10.  I ordered their Biscuit plate special, with grits. It was great, fantastic gravy, great bacon and perfect grits. Wifey ordered the South Mountain plate, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy. She loved it. We shared a single pancake and it was awesome. Will return and recommend.",

The omelettes are always delicious and you can really tell that they are from fresh local eggs!! The orange juice is also freshly squeezed! (Update as of 4/1/16 the orange juice is from a container lol we saw it before we checked out lol) but it's still good,  My husband always raves about the premium thick cut smokey bacon yum!! We make an effort to drive to this location from chandler because we believe it's the best! Service is always fantastic with the older pretty ladies there! Seats are comfortable and space is always cleaned! Did I tell you about the biscuits yet??? Omg super delicious with their fluffy butter and huge portions! Please give them a try they will be totally worth it, don't mind all the older people there (you know it's good when u see a lot of old old people there) you can't mess with their food (^_^) !!!",

There were a couple who came in about 15 minutes after us. When someone finally called the next customer, it was the people who came in after me that got the table before us- we were the exact same number of guests. I was shocked and made sure it was known by me throwing my hands in the air to acknowledge we were there first.   I observed the busboy dropping a wet rag on the high traffic and dirty floor. He picked it up and went on to wash several tables. Oh my gosh! NO!!!!!!!  I was looking forward to ordering the very same choices as the first visit. I enjoyed the food from the first visit so I wanted a repeat. I was bummed. Everything tasted different. Omelette overcooked and dry. Smaller portion of hash browns. Grits was really dry. My daughter ordered the same food as the first visit yet was very underwhelmed and disappointed.",

Thankfully we made the smart decision not to wait and made the trek to try out Biscuits.  We were greeted with a wait (20 Min) but the staff was quick to bus tables and service was speedy so it was more like a 10 min wait.  Their menu has a great variety but is mostly down home food.  I ordered the SOS and The Boy opted for the Chorizo Sampler.  First off, the portions are HUGE!  My SOS was 2, large biscuits cut in half and covered in gravy.  The gravy itself was just ok, tasted mostly of flour and pepper.  The boy enjoyed his Chorizo sampler and my hash browns were great.  Our server was pleasant, but was very scatter brained.  She missed the cheese on my hash browns and also asked me how I wanted my eggs cooked for the SOS, making me think they were part of the meal.  We got the bill and found an up-charge for the eggs I wouldn't have ordered if they weren't part of the meal (the menu listed 2 options for SOS, with or without eggs, another Yelper already posted a picture of it).    Overall, we enjoyed our food, but with all the up charges it ended up being a $35 breakfast for 2 people.",

We had to ask our server twice to turn our fan above us off and she replied both times saying she agrees it was cold and she will ask the manager to turn it down. The people around us started complaining about it being cold as well and then I overheard another server tell the other server \"the manager thinks it's too hot in here so he doesn't want to turn it off\". That said enough about the place for me. Good and decent food and like I said I understand it gets busy that stuff is out of their servers control but management needs a tune up.",

The food wasn't health conscious at all but if you're looking to fill up with calories and get a good-sized portion then this is your type of place. Also, I am not a fan of the diner-type ambiance...

Instead she goes \"pick up?\" In which I reply ed yes and began the check out.  Now for the food. Food was pretty good. I had the biscuit special. It was pretty food. Their sausage gravy didn't appear to have any sausage in it till I realized what I thought was mushrooms was actually the sausage. Regardless everything was pretty good. Eggs were delicious!

Wait typically isn't too long, hostess is quick to recognize new guests, customers are called several times until located and the promptly seated.  Waitresses are usually quick to approach table for beverage order and if not, the busboys serve as efficient backups and assist with getting the table started.  Coke products at this location.  Did I mention that yet?  And the waitresses are good about making sure you have something in you glass/cup to drink.  Biscuits are good.  Sausage links, no patties here, are okay if you like that stuff. I'm used to Bob Evans or Jimmy Dean sausage so most restaurant sausage doesn't taste good to me. Bacon, crispy CRISPY.  I like mine on the rare and wiggly side so no bacon for me. Ham is okay. The Polish sausage is on the greasy side but has good flavor.   Chicken fried steak is hearty, crisp, and smothered well with gravy which compliments it nicely. Potatoes are the shredded hash browns or the cubed type which I think are the O'Briens or country fries. Grits are buttered but I think they're yummy.  Nothing like grits, biscuits and gravy, and  chicken fried steak to make you feel that your were born and raised in the South. In this case, living close to South Mountain.    One last thing. They have a fish fry on Fridays so they're open for dinner.",

The brands were tasty with an extra kick that reminded me of being cooked in cast iron. The salsa was like Pace Picante medium with extra cilantro. Overall it was a good burrito for $8.95. The service was good and we were seated right away.",

Sorry, that's not the case here. Their biscuits tasted like they were baked several days ago and were microwaved. They were dry and hard on the bottom.  I ordered a hotdog, which was on a bun that I think I've purchased at the grocery store... y'know, the kind you get in an 8-ct package for $0.99. The fries tasted like they were frozen.   My friend ordered the southern style chicken strips. He figured they'd be really good since they were $9 and were listed as a house specialty. Sorry, but it seems like these were frozen, too, and the fries were the same ones I got.  To top off the whole experience, the waitress was snippy and didn't want to take our Groupons. They said one per person and she was convinced that they should be one per table.   TL/DR version: Overpriced food for what I can get at Walmart and fry at home or pick up for half the cost at McDonald's.",

I either have to wait forever to either get a menu or place my order. If a waitress asks you if you need a minute or two to decide what you want say NO and just pick something to order! Because a minute or two to them is about ten minutes in real time! This has happened several times to me. And yesterday I was done with my meal for at least 15 minutes and my plate had already been cleared away and I still didn't have my bill. I didn't see my server anywhere around and the other servers wouldn't even look in my direction when I tried to flag them down. Once I finally got my bill I took it to the front counter to pay and wait a couple more minutes because nobody was there. I finally just left enough cash to cover my bill on the counter and left. I like their food but if the service continues like it has I'll be finding a new place, even if it's out of my way!",

    "text": "The food is fantastic! It is fresh with quality ingredients and cooked to order. I always order the chicken-fried-chicken breakfast. Chicken is moist and juicy with the right amount of and well seasoned crispy breading. Eggs are cooked perfectly to over easy, as I order them. The biscuit, fluffy, substantial, moist and flavorful. Hash browns are somewhat inconsistent; they've been overcooked or slightly burnt occasionally. Whoever joins me at Biscuits enjoys the quality and taste of whatever they order.   Go for the food, it is homemade and great tasting!  Service is great, except for one unprofessional server (female, shorter, thin with chin length red hair). If not for the server, I would have given 5 Stars. This server has been somewhat snippy on two occasions she was assigned to my table. Another time she could be heard from my table half way across the restaurant near the front door spewing negative, and incorrect information about healthcare policy (keep your politics to yourself in places of business - not all of us agree with you). Twice, she was at the cashier station and did not acknowledge or thank me. Most recently, as I approached and handed her my credit card and check, she took them and processed the transaction while continuing a conversation with another server complaining about a server who was scheduled for the upcoming Sunday who was not needed, in her opinion. She was so worked up that she flipped/threw my receipt on the counter at me, oblivious she was interacting with a person, nonetheless a customer. I took my receipt and left. She did not thank me, make eye contact, just yapped on in an irritated tone with negative body language. This weekend, the customers a table near me left as soon as their meal was served without eating it. I overheard them tell the host they were not pleased how this same server responded to their complaint of underdone pancakes. The server jumped in and said, \"I didn't mean it,\" and walked away. I hope the owners, who seem very nice and professional, are aware/become of the continually problem server and act accordingly.  The weekday regular busser is efficient, professional, and pleasant, as are the other servers.   Biscuits gives back in a nice way too....discounts to all veterans, past or present.",

    "text": "Biscuits is OK. I'm not opposed to returning, but I'm in no hurry to do so either. The food is a little better than those national chain breakfast spots...but it's nowhere near phenomenal either. The concept of the restaurant is sound, and it seems like the owner's intentions are good; but the execution isn't fully up to par.  NOTES: +The biscuits are indeed good. Big, fluffy, hot, & fresh. They're even a tiny bit crispy on the outside. Very tasty...and I don't even usually like biscuits. +Served with real butter (not margarine). Nice. =Bacon was decent...crispy, and not super greasy. But it wasn't super thick and meaty (and apple-smoked) like some of the better breakfast spots. =The chili was ok. But it could have used less cumin in the recipe. There was so much that it almost had a curry taste. +My eggs were cooked perfectly! A perfect over-medium. That's difficult for a lot of restaurants to get right. Props. =Hashbrowns were decent. Not very flavorful though...and they aren't really generous with them either. Potatoes aren't THAT expensive, and it looks better when the plates come out full. -Corned beef hash was awful. Too many green peppers in it. That's all you tasted. Bad recipe. I wonder sometimes if the chef/cook even loves to eat when I taste a recipe that off. +Generous with the soda. They give you an extra little container with your initial (big) cup of it -- that way you're in no danger of running out. [I personally don't drink that much, so it was wasted on me, but I appreciated the thoughtfulness.] +Service was good. Friendly. Speedy. They even took the corned beef hash off of my bill because I really didn't like it. Very cool.  Overall, tremendous upside for Biscuits. It definitely has potential. I'll probably be back at some point, but it's not at the top of my list of things to do. Still, I wish them the best. I hope they continue to improve because Ahwatukee could use a solid diner-style breakfast spot.",

Being a Marine veteran myself, this place has already scored points with me.  The food's pretty good, better than average but definitely has some room for improvements; not enough to turn me away from the place.  Being a creature of habit, I always get the country fried steak and eggs with a biscuit.  They're fairly consistent with their preparation of it too.  Coffee is....well, it's diner coffee, which really only adds to the charm of the place because really, I do sort of see it more of a diner than a restaurant.  I think they should really throw in a counter and some stools.  And of course their biscuits...  By naming your place Biscuits, I think you set the customer's expectations of the biscuits pretty high.  Don't expect too much and you'll find that their biscuits are pretty good.",

However, they don't serve breakfast in the evening. They have a very limited menu. I had the fish sandwich with fries and soup, for 9.89, my husband had the fish fry, cole slaw and fries for 9.89 (no soup or salad) The clam chowder was awful, it tasted like corn starch and only had a couple potatoes and no clams. The fish itself was good, but the fries tasted stale.  The breakfast might still be ok, but after such a disappointing dinner, I won't be back. It is a shame, this place used to be good.",

I noticed others on yelp said the same thing about the harsh taste. Yes I do plan on revisiting soon. I will just pass on the cup o joe.

Corned beef hash very different had great homemade flavor just lacked enough potatoes, my opinion.  Better than Dennys just not that great breakfast spot we were looking for.",

Its not my favorite breakfast restaurant choice, but my hiking group wanted to get brunch close to South Mountain following a fairly strenuous hike.   There were 10 of us, and unfortunately we had to be split up because the 2 available tables (right next to each other, mind you) were in separate sections and neither server wanted to take our group. So that made brunch difficult to communicate with everyone, so disappointing they wouldn't push them together  I typically order the same thing at Biscuits- the combo of scrambled eggs, sausage, breakfast potatoes & a biscuit. This meal wasn't bad, except it took for-ever to get out to us. Our tables ordered at the exact same time, but our table received our meals a good 15 minutes after the other table.",

The team that works there is awesome!  They are friendly, caring, all around good people.  The food is always good and today was no exception.  The biscuits - as one would expect - are exceptional and my standard meal, the Denver omelet is fantastic!  Oh...and I love a place that doesn't try to cram our family of five into a booth with a chair on the end!  They have spacious tables here!",

Friendly but busy staff, free coffee while you wait and they always say they are sorry for making you wait.    The decor is back home country. Reminds me of my grandma's kitchen.   The food is good, and a huge plus for having chicken fried chicken for breakfast, that means no more having to go to nasty cracker barrel for it!    I love the country gravy, love the chicken fried chicken. The grits seem pre-sweetened and I can see how people might not like that, myself I am all good with that. Now the one downer is the Biscuits, I am not a huge fan, they are huge and heavy. I myself like the lighter ones.   I've had breakfast and lunch items both there and all have been lovely. My best friend swears by the corned beef hash, he orders it as an add on to everything and anything he gets there.   You can eat and get beyond full for two for about 20 bucks and that is a huge plus for me.   The only bad thing we ever got there was a cinnamon roll for my son. He said it was nasty and couldn't get past one bite, he said it tasted like a hard roll with some funky icing.  I have never myself tried it but it didn't look that good honestly. But hey, if that is the only minus for them I am ok with that!  I would totally suggest getting over here and give them a try, they are also open late on Friday and Sat's for fish frys!",

Their chicken fried steaks are well seasoned, tender, and delicious as well as the corned beef hash.  I usually pick between the two and get a side of either a fresh blueberry muffin, which comes out warm and drizzled with brown sugar or a pancake, which is also very tasty.  My only complaint is that I wish the biscuits were bigger.",

We came to Biscuits because my mom swore it was the best breakfast place around...sadly, I disagree. It felt old as soon as we walked in...ripped booths, dirty floors, tired and disinterested staff....actually, I should mention it started in the parking lot- where we were greeted by 3 kitchen employees smoking and leaning on a car (most likely before cooking our breakfast) no one smiled, there was only a handful of other tables...none under the age of 80- and the food was okay. Breakfast is hard- only three ways it can go, amazing, average or terrible. This was average at best. Nothing to brag about and nothing to bring me back. Eggs are eggs- service, decor and a unique menu is what sets the good ones apart from the rest. When in AZ I doubt I would ever return to Biscuits, too many other choices with a lot more to offer.",

As we sat down to read the menus we were greeted by an unfriendly face and a furrowed brow. Our server was impatient and short with us from the start. I was slow to make an opinion as we all have our bad days, but after the rude comments she made to my friend and slamming the water pitcher down next to me when I asked for more water, I realized it had gone too far. While the food was good, it was not good enough to excuse the poor service and treatment we received from our waitress I believe she also had some involvement with the owner/management side of the business as well. The kind of treatment we received was inexcusable regardless of the popularity of food served. There are just too many good breakfast places around town that give you better service with better food. I usually don't like to write bad reviews on people or restaurants, but hopefully this review will help spark a change in service.",

While my \"Test Breakfast\" was absolutely awful, I was more interested in the comments of the people around me.   \"Very slow service.\"   \"Doesn't taste like a pancake.\"  \"Even the coffee is awful.\"  \"This sausage tastes like bologna.\"  My \"Test?\"  Sausage Gravy and Biscuits. Seems for a place named \"Biscuits,\" this dish should be a trademark signature dish. Absolutely awful taste! Made with link sausage and the fellow \"breakfaster\" was correct, when he said that the sausage tasted like bologna! The gravy was pasty and tasted like flour with no sausage taste at all. Not even a butter taste to it. Quite possibly the worst I have ever had!   The biscuits you ask? Awful as well, being thin and tasteless bordering on way too salty and equally inedible.  Incidentally, when asked \"how was everything\" I replied \"not good,\" the Cashier didn't follow up to ask what was wrong, she just gave me my change and said \"thanks for coming in.\"  They will have to get lots better in order to make it. I won't try it again, but my prediction is they won't last.",

I would have thrown out the lettuce in my home.  One of my friends had a traditional breakfast, and he said he was great.  Eggs cook properly, and again generous portions.  My last friend (at breakfast, not on the face of the earth)  had a breakfast burrito, and said it was very good.  I think my salad was the weakest link.  The service was good, and everyone seemed very friendly.  We were seated within 10 minutes, and being warned there would be a wait.  They left carafes of coffee, iced tea, and soda on the table for self-refilling.  The prices were fine.  I'd go back, but avoid the salad...at least at lunch time.",

    "text": "Really good neighborhood cafe for breakfast and brunches :)  I have been here like 4 times and each time, they had great service and good food.  In terms of creativity of the menu, this place beats Cracker Barrel but does not have as adventurous a menu as Crackers and Co Cafe, down the road.    The ambience is kind of like a comfortable neighbourhood eatery where u go to for dinner if you are too tired to cook.  Comfortable seats, lots of natural light thru their diner looking windows and a staff that will probably get to know your name after a few times.  Food wise, like what the other reviewers said, they make a mean biscuit.  I know, not everybody is a big fan of it, so get their pancakes instead.  They do put in some biscuit batter in it to give it a very different feeling.  But dun just go there for biscuits haha, other stuff like egg and sausage, are very standard breakfast stuff.  Do check out the portugese sausage instead of the regular ones, a lot more flavorful and a little spicy.  I also had lunch here before, they have a smoked chicken jalapeno alfredo.  I like it very much, its got a lot of chicken and quite a bit of cheese over it.  True the jalapeno does not make it spicy enough for my liking, but its fusion italian so I guess the jalapeno is to enhance its flavor and not dominate it.  Also jalapeno in az is not spicy, if you want spicy pasta, maybe ask them to add a pinch of habanero to the sauce to spice it up.  Its by far one of the best fusion pasta I have had before.  I know its not those fancy fusion food where u get two bites worth of food and U are still hungry and end up with a big check.  This is a pretty decent size plate which will keep you full and happy.  I hear they have an excellent fish fry too on Friday, but like others who reviewed it, they seem to close a little earlier.  But its fine, just go earlier if you really mean to eat there ! :)  or else just do brunch there on a lazy weekend, you will likely be satisfied.  Else let the owners know, they are usually at the counter or going around refilling coffee and asking if you enjoyed your meal and such.",

The menu was simple and everything looked good. I ordered a Denver Omelette.  The food was delivered quickly and the portions were very generous. The food was great!  We approached the register and there was a short wait. An older gentleman processed our check and thanked us for our patience. He acknowledged that the place \"got their asses handed to them\" referring the the volume of customers. I assured him that they handled it very well.

The food got better and better, and to this day, its actually one of our favorite places for not only breakfast, but surprisingly for chorizo as well, as seen in our pics of the chorizo scrambler and chorizo breakfast quesadillas! If you want a chilled, relaxed, and homey place for breakfast and lunch, and enjoy good ol fashioned American style of mom and pop restaurant, definitely give this place a try. At times the air conditioning in the larger dining area can be sparse, but the staff is always accommodating, the owners are always around to greet and help you, and the service is decent for speed and efficiency. Thank you Biscuits for always giving a solid performance!",

One thing I've yet to try but eager too, is their WWll spam and eggs, I grew up in span so I really want to get it next time I'm in. All in all, I rate this place 4/5 the coffee is tasty, and you get great portions when it comes to their food. Chicken fried steak or chicken fried chicken are must haves, the biscuits and gravy are also great. The pancakes not so much, kinda dry and dense, maybe it was an off day?

I guess the plate decor is there to take your mind off of the lack of hashbrowns. The hashbrowns had an okay amount of crispiness. In order to survive as a business, I suppose the owners are trying to reduce food costs. The biscuit itself was good. There was nothing unique on the menu that would tempt me back.",

But if you're looking for a laid back environment with good food, give Biscuits a try! Be warned, our waiter seemed overwhelmed and would disappear for long periods at a time. I'd recommend ordering by the time they bring you your drinks and asking for the check when they bring you your food.   The restaurant was very large inside and we were seated immediately when we arrived on a Saturday late morning. The waiter came fairly quickly to get our drink order, but after he dropped off the drinks, he didn't come back for our order for nearly 20 minutes. Although the menu is big, it didn't take us that long to figure out what we wanted. Thankfully the food didn't take too long to come out given our wait up to that point. The standout was the chicken fried steak.   Our waiter again disappeared on us, so we waited awhile after we finished eating to finally get our check. Luckily you pay at the counter which allowed us a quicker check-out than he would have provided.   Food probably deserves 4 stars, but our speed of service was a 2. I will say, even though he disappeared a lot, when we did interact with our waiter, he was a nice guy.",

Biscuits definitely serves to a older clientele as was obvious as the waitress disdain to us not being ready to order the second time she came to the table.   Ordered the Eggs Benedict on a biscuit with Canadian bacon instead of regularly. It was subpar. It was covered in way to much hollandaise sauce so it masked the entire flavor of everything else. It was a subpar sauce at that too. Tried some of my friends breakfast sandwich and potatoes which was pretty good! Overall good portion slice but I don't think I'll return again.

They were playing 70's soft rock from SiriusXM over the speakers.   I was greeted right away and offered drinks. I ordered iced tea, One Biscuit and gravy plus a side of Corned Beef Hash.   My breakfast arrived in six minutes. The hash was about 40% beef, 50% potatoes and 10% onions. A very good ratio. Just the right caramelization too.   The biscuit was a fluffy, 1\" high pillow with no 'flour taste', which means it was perfectly made. Plenty of thick, creamy white gravy and big chunks of chopped sausage. I wanted to lick the dish.   I could not improve either dish.   Definitely a return visit in my future.",

I saw the good reviews for Biscuits and when I called they took my name down and said we would be seated pretty quickly upon arrival, and we were! Service was fast and friendly and food came out quickly, but tasted fresh.  The place itself was cute. Very casual, but also gave a cozy, homey feel.  Again, we had 6 people - NO ONE had any complaints about their food, which is impressive! I had the huevos rancheros, which were on a large soft flour tortilla rather than crispy, corn ones, but was insanely delicious. I usually still have to add hot sauce to my huevos rancheros dishes, but the sauce they add in the kitchen made it absolutely delicious and I didn't need to add anything! I also had a side of their biscuit after a friend mentioned how wonderful they were, and it did NOT disappoint! So soft and crumbly and delicious! Other friends had omelets, scrambled eggs, benedicts, biscuits and gravy, fried okra, etc. Everyone was extremely happy with their dishes! Overall, reasonably priced, as well!",

    "text": "I have come here a couple times and liked the food. It was what you would typically expect and nothing outstanding for breakfast except the biscuits...those are good! BUT this last time was absolutely absurd..... I was there this past Sunday morning. Asked for scrambled soft eggs, hash browns, and LIMP bacon. I was extremely specific about this and said it multiple times to get the point across BC places never get it right. Food comes out and my eggs are scrambled HARD and the bacon is of course CRISPY. I asked again for limp bacon and the server said OK. A moment later I'm assuming the manager comes over and she told me that I can't get my bacon limp. They prebake the bacon and that's just how it comes. And then she added and I quote, \"plus most people like their bacon crispy or extra crispy anyway.\" I was shocked! First off, it's breakfast. The easiest thing to make and should be made FRESH to order. Secondly, for her to tell me that I should pretty much like it the way everyone else does was appalling. I told her, \"well I don't!\" She then dismissed what I said and said she could take off the charge if I wasn't going to eat it. Ummmm OF COURSE!  Whenever I go up there to visit friends and get breakfast there, I'm never ordering anything but a biscuit ever again. Oh yeah, and then I was charged an extra buck for my meal that I wouldn't have noticed had I not paid attention to the prices. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE BECAUSE OF THE MANAGER/PRECOOKED FOOD.",

I thought the coffee was good, it had a nice nutty flavor. I ordered an omelet with avocado, onion, broccoli, and asparagus. I thought it was fine, but nothing special. The cheese they used didn't have a ton of flavor and I thought the home fries had a really weird flavor. The biscuit... which should have been really good.... was not so good. It was not flaky nor did it taste like what I expect from a good biscuit.... The BF got the biscuits and gravy and said he liked it, so that's why I added another star. Overall, I would not go out of my way to eat here again.",

The menu is all good old fashioned food, and there are times I appreciate a straight forward meal that hasn't been messed with.  1. I do like the food, a lot. This is the type of meal the chain restaurants try to copy and market as \"home cooking\", that stuff doesn't hold a candle to the real deal.  2. The service is outstanding. The staff is so nice, one of the servers has become an auntie to our 1 yr old son. He just beams every time he sees her.  3. I really like that it's local and they use local and organic whenever they can. A big plus for me.  4. Spam. They have a WW II Spam & eggs breakfast plate on the menu that I just had-to, had-to try. How does it get more home cooking than that? Oh, by having S&!# On a Shingle, that's how.  5. I grew up in small farming communities in the Intermountain West, so this place felt like home to me.

My fiance and I gathered both our families here for a Sunday brunch to make sure we had all our wedding details finalized.  We knew we'd have a large party and didn't want to wait, so we made reservations.  What a great idea that turned out to be.  This places is PACKED on Sundays.  People walked in, took a look at the crowd, and walked out.  I felt bad for the crowd waiting as they don't have a lot of benches, etc, to sit down on.  Some bales of hay, with blankets thrown over them.  Not my cup of tea, but I know they're trying to stick with the country theme.  We were all seated fairly promptly.  The waitress came by immediately to get our drink orders, but informed us they hadn't gotten their soda delivery so Coke & Diet Coke were not an option (tear).  Our food came fairly quickly.  I had a house omelet with green chilies, chorizo, and a mixture of cheeses.  The omelet was good, but very chorizo heavy.  I found myself search for other flavors.  The hash browns were also crispy and yummy.  Several people at the table ordered their biscuits and gravy & said it was ridiculously delicious.  The kids with us had some of the biggest pancakes I've ever seen.  Overall the service and food was very good.  I'll have no problem going back in the near future.",

Possibly the best pancakes I've ever had, the \"Champion Pancakes.\"  Made with whole wheat batter, tons of sliced almonds, granola, cinnamon, and blueberries - all stirred into the batter.  I asked for no butter, and they were completely non-greasy.  There are several fruit syrups to choose from as well as REAL maple syrup.  Good grits!  Good, \"country potatoes\" made fresh, not frozen.  Fresh-squeezed orange juice.  Next time, I'll try the fresh blueberry muffin or the frosted cinnamon roll, but I won't skip those pancakes! Super wait staff - really friendly and prompt.   A comfortable, spacious, no-hurry atmosphere.  Not the \"eat and get out\" I've experienced at the chain restaurants.   Easy to find - right off the interstate.  Large parking area - restaurant itself is right next to a strip mall. I'll be returning each time I visit Phoenix.

In fact they are currently the top runner for best Reuben and best Turkey Melt in the city.  The portion size is pretty spot on.  Although I think they could give more in their sides (fries, rings, etc.).  I usually order a biscuit as well and leave very satisfied.

Less than two mins later I placed my order (French toast, cheese eggs, bacon and grits) less than three mins my food was in my face. The waitress made me feel like I was home (P-Cola,Fl.) she gave me some history on how she's the one who makes the grits :). Next time your looking for a nice, clean, cozy, friendly place to eat; try Biscuits. I soooo sound like a commercial LOL... Will, I be back? You bet ya!",

So lame and so generic..but yeah its phoenix where im learning slowly after 2 years here that the majority doesn't know what real or good food is. Especially food with any sort of soul.",

We were disappointed to find that breakfast is not served all day on Fridays, as they have their Friday Fish Fry.    No matter, it just gives us an excuse to come back.  The chicken fried chicken was perfectly crispy and seasoned well.  DH ate EVERYTHING on his plate.  The only thing he did not really love was that the corn was heavily buttered.  Next time he will ask for no butter.    The smoked chicken jalapeno alfredo was good, but I may skip it in the future.  I only found three small slices of jalapeno and I was hoping for something spicy.  This was very mild and the pasta was drowned in sauce.  Some people might like a lot of sauce, but I prefer it to be just coated... not floating.  It did come with two pieces of delicious garlic toast, which was a definite bonus.  If I do order it again, I will just ask for the sauce on the side and extra jalapenos for heat!  DD just had a grilled cheese with applesauce.  She did not like the applesauce because she happened to bite into a spoonful of cinnamon.  Oops!  DH didn't stir it for her and I sort of missed that, as well!  I asked the waitress for a biscuit and she brought one over to me to try,  It was actually very good.  It was not sweet like some other reviewers mentioned.  I found it heavy, but I like my biscuits that way!  The best part about Biscuits was the service.  The waitress was very nice and helpful.  One of the ladies from up front came by to check on us and even brought us a to go menu when we told her it was our first visit.  I mentioned their website had been down, but she said it should be up by now and that a lot of customers had mentioned it.  It's not up yet... hmm.  We will definitely come back to Biscuits again... next time for breakfast.",

    "text": "Our team went here yesterday to celebrate CeCe's birthday.  It's a few doors down from Los Taquitos - and I have driven past many times, but was skeptical for many reasons.  The decor / ambiance reminded me of all the reasons I moved away from Idaho.  Immediately when you walk in there is a giant painting of a barn - and scattered bales of hay covered in grandma's quilts... if that doesn't remind you of home cookin' I don't know what will.  We were seated, and as I perused the menu, nothing was sticking out as appetizing.  Finally I settled on the reuben, which was recommended by our waitress, a lifer, who was actually really sweet and funny.  In regards to service, at least her service, I would give this joint five stars.    The corned beef on the sando was delicious, and the kraut was well seasoned.  Overall, it was one of the better reubens I've had here on the west coast.  The other item our table ordered that got rave reviews was the chicken fried chicken and club sandwich.  I think, in this case, I just cannot get past the decor.  It looked exactly like the majority of restaurants that Chef Ramsey walks into before making Kitchen Nightmare makeover suggestions.  Random shoddy wooden chickens and dusty relics you'd see in a thrift store for good reason.  So - to my wonderful waitress, great job for making the most of what you have to work with... but to the rest of you, just go next door and get the carne asada @ Los Taquitos.",

I came just before two, bust time wrapping up lunch. What upset me was how they were \"training\" a bus boy. For over 15 min I had to hear about how poor his job has been.  (Place is very clean).   I ate alone and have a lot on my mind.  Not was I was looking for.   I'll be back for sure though. Bring family and visitors they will be jealous and get to see nice part of south mnt  Bgood y'all",

    "text": "I can see Biscuits becoming a mid-day go-to for late breakfast and lunch.  I've stopped in a few times, also gotten takeout, and I can see why it's starting to build a following.  Solid+ down home food, A+ service  I'll mention this right up early . . . their Portuguese sausage is excellent, and cooked just the way I like it.  Sliced and crisped all over.  Yeah, I wiped a few napkins full of grease off them, but they were a great side.  DEFINITELY will be back for those.  Seriously, who else is doing Portuguese sausage in AZ?  Next, their meatloaf with mushroom red wine gravy is great.  Strange to me, it comes with mashed covered in white gravy?  Huh?  The next time I order the meatloaf, and I certainly will again, the white gravy is getting 86'd.    Three times I've had the Denver omelet, and it's always been solid.  Not great, kinda skimpy on the green peppers and ham, but well made.  The hash browns are standard, which makes their corned beef hash a bit of a disappointment.  I'm by no means an expert on corned beef hash, but I wanted crispy hash browns mixed with corned beef, and both came out kinda soggy.  Their biscuits . . . I believe they mix in some grits . . . are definitely gut bombs.  Perfect for a hungover morning.  If you're eating in, and order pop, they bring you your pop in a big glass and leave an extra carafe of it at the table.  Nice.  Wasteful sometimes, but nice.  Overall, Biscuits is a great addition to the Ahwatukee neighborhood",
