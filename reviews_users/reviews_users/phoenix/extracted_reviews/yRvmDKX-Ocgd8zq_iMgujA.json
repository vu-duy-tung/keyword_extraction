You are on a roof top, overlooking Phoenix with a beautiful pool calling your name.   The servers came around and offered their appetizers for all of us to sample and enjoy and I must say that food was amazing as well.   The cocktail list is fun, filled with delectable and fresh drinks and expect to pay around $10 a drink.    This reminds me of some of the chic roof top pool bars in NYC. Once again this is a gem in downtown Phoenix that has made me happY!!",

I have been here a few times when the atmosphere has been relaxing and nice.   They have some good drinks for happy hour. Good to excellent service depending on the night. The clientele is hit and miss, I guess much due to its dependence on who is staying at the hotel this place is located on top of. Dead smack center Phoenix downtown, so the view is quite nice.   I find this is a place I have to investigate further... and I will.  ..und das..",

Our bill was all messed up - wrong prices for items and it took them way too long to figure out how to get a voided copy of the wrong bill for our hosts records.   One of our group members asked for her the bill and she said she saw our server drinking a martini instead of getting it for her.  The ambiance and the view from the rooftop was very nice, but overall, I don't recommend this place.",

    "text": "On the 3rd floor rooftop of the Palomar Hotel looking towards the South, you will find this bar. It's a bit hard to find from the street - you have to go up an escalator at City Center and then up some stairs off to the side.   There is a vast array of seating selection. As this is the hotel's pool as well, there are cabanas, beach lounge chairs around the pool  as well as separate outdoor couches with coffee tables and regular tables and high tops. As well, there is a bar in the center with TVs.   The space is really nice - who doesn't love a rooftop? You can see the sports venues from here - so would be a great place to go for a quick drink before the game.   The food was good - I recommend the burger highly. It's grass-fed beef with pepper jack cheese. I think the only drawback is that this isn't really meant to be a restaurant - it's pool food. So the menu is very limited (burger with chips or a salad, not fries or cheese plate, charcuterie plate, etc.) However, I would definitely consider it a destination to go before a game for appetizer or a quick drink to enjoy the weather and the view.  Oh yeah! And because this is a pool - the drinks come in plastic cups/glasses (reusable fortunately!) and all the beers are on draft or canned. Just so you aren't caught off guard. One side note - they don't have Kiltlifter on draft.",

Plenty of grub to enjoy during the rooftop celebration of the New Year.  I am glad they had plenty of heaters since it was in the 30/40 degree range, which is cold for the majority of us.  With the 3rd floor open roof, the heaters became gathering spots for me and other cold guests.   Plenty of security and no rift raft was noted during the event.  The four of us had a good time.  Plenty of people, friendly at that and I personally had enough liquor in one night.    The fake snow was an interesting part of the New Year celebration.  The snow poured out as the New Year began.  I also noted great music, DJ was great with plenty of uplifting music.  Created plenty of energy in the crowd of people.    If I were to decide on a place to go for 2014 it will be hard not to go back to the Lustre Bar for New Years.",

It had been awhile since that event and just recently I needed to come up with a cool place for my boyfriend's birthday. We decided Lustre would be great because it's so open and relaxing for larger parties. They also have an amazing selection of drinks with lots of fresh juices. Yum!   I love the location and view of downtown Phoenix from Lustre Rooftop Garden Bar. Lustre Bar is located on the 3rd floor of the swanky Hotel Palomar. We had reserved a hotel for the birthday festivities and it was definitely the best plan ever. We had the option of having cake and champagne in the hotel room and then we headed up to Lustre for a few more rounds.   If you are visiting Phoenix, this hotel is centrally located in downtown Phoenix with access to CityScape dining and entertainment, Golds Gym and the Valley Metro Light Rail, as well as Chase Field and US Airways Center, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Phoenix Suns.    Make sure to plan a pool party at Lustre in the spring! It's definitely on my to-do list.",

It would have been nice if any of the four servers had asked us if we needed a drink instead of just talking to each other.

I'm sorry it has taken this long to write a thank you note.  You're more than just a swank bar for happy hour fun. All summer long there were yoga sessions. Although tree poses evaded me, they offered the wonderful experience to gaze out onto the city. Onto South Mountain. While winding down at the end of yoga you're supposed to close your eyes during Shavasana. Instead I gazed upwards at the hotel. With the building stretching endlessly into the sky there was enough relaxation for the two of us.  Without a bit of tension in my body I'd roll to your bar. All yoga studios should operate this way.   I can't imagine what delightful drink and food specials the cooler weather will offer. However, the summer specials were killer. $6 for a respectable draft list. $6 for red and white wine. (Occasionally I'll drink the white wines. Thank you for having some.) $6 for flatbreads. $6 for hummus. (Before 6pm!)  And no. I did not forget the speciality cocktails you so magically mix.  I just drank too many of them.  Moving on.  Although I never booked a cabana I enjoyed the luxury of one last night. Oof! Late night partying is crazy! The DJ on hand for the Arizona Ballet Black & White event was superb. Dressed to the nines our group was dancing. (Not very well, but we were dancing. Or maybe that was just me :)  In a heart beat I'd recommend Lustre Bar to someone looking to eat, drink and be merry in the downtown area. Parking is a cinch. Thank you for validating the first two hours at the Cityscape garage. Should I want to Light Rail it you're uber close to a stop.   So thank you Lustre Bar!",

    "text": "Lustre is officially my favorite hang out spot in downtown. Heading to a rooftop is always a good move on a clear desert night, and the views are some of the best around. The location on top of CityScape is close to everything and around here a view of the arena and the mountains is as good as it gets. It has a laid back but fun vibe - the kind of place where you can hang out with friends and get credit for choosing a good spot.  The couple of times that I went there, the DJ was on point, and I ended up staying longer than I planned because of it. The pool is roped off in the evenings, so you can't sit poolside, but it does provide a nice backdrop.   Two issues prevent me from giving it 5 stars. First, it suffers from the same issue that many hotel-based lounges have: the crowd seems to be a mix of peoplethat made a specific plan to come here and the ones who randomly wandered down from their room at the Hotel Palomar - you can tell the difference. Some may like that mix but it takes away some of the place's identity.  The second issue is the general service level - it can be slow, especially when there is a crowd, the selection of drinks and food options are limited.  In another city I might give this place a 3, but it gets a solid 4 in PHX.",

The gated entrance looks like a locked fire door, but made of glass, so that was weird, but also tipped me off to how to access this secret Pool Bar @ 1st St and Jefferson...holy smokes, a pool on the third floor!!!  Drinks were a bit pricey, and not a lot of room at the counter, with the large seats and all, but they WERE comfy. A couple large screens to check out the Stanley Cup Playoffs (or whatever), and sofas and squishy chairs spread around the deck area, so to encourage you away from the bar, I suppose...but really, the place has a very relaxed atmosphere and very attentive servers, but like most pool bars, it had a party feel and a little messy and unkept, but hey, it's a Pool Bar, right?  The view is pretty sweet, and being on the southeast corner of the building, it's perfectly situated to view our two sports arenas, and plus, YOUR OUTSIDE, which I really like. A great place to take first time out-of-towners!",

    "text": "Good friend, great views, terrible service.  I have been here twice now.  I went around 7pm on a Saturday in January. It was perfect weather for the fun  rooftop bar. The servers were OK but similar to some other reviews, indifferent and then later, took over 30 minutes to get us our bills and over 30 minutes to return the credit cards.    Some friends and I came to Lustre during happy hour on a day where few people were around. The bartender acted as though we were annoying him, as I asked about if we should order at the bar or at a table. He had just two people at the bar; it was not busy.  The server was OK but not great, not friendly.   She took quite some time with bills during this date as well.    Food:  OK - flat bread pizzas, salads, cheese, chips/dip.    View: Great! Fun to see all of downtown from here.   Service: Needs improvement.   I'd maybe go again when I have a lot of time to wait for servers to acknowledge our presence and to bring back the bills.",

I liked the set up pool on one side cabanas with live DJ on the opposite side with full bar and a food menu. The food was very good. I had the BBQ chicken flatbread and the tater tots in the skillet smothered. The drinks weren't \"weak\"! I was VERY pleased with staff and the service. My only reason for not giving 5 stars was the DJ was stuck in the 90's rock era, which was definitely not the crowd that night. People kept requesting something different. I actually went and ask him to play more current songs, like top 40 and he literally said \"I don't listen to the radio\". Great food, Great drinks, Great atmosphere, Terrible music.",

Their drinks are priced similarly to other bars in the area, but they just aren't that delicious. Lustre has a limited number of beers on draft and their cocktails are just ok (unlike their sister bar, Blue Hound, which had great beverages). I will probably be back because of the location, the view, and the fact that it's great for parties, but for straight up drinking, I would probably go elsewhere.",

And I do plan on going back to try other dishes. however if you want any service good luck. the service that does exist was rude condescending and lacking in any kind of customer service skills. We couldn't even get our table  bussed. I took my own glasses and cups up to the bar. that part was extremely disappointing. When I go out I don't have a problem spending the money so there shouldn't be a problem getting the service. Yes you are providing a service bartenders and servers the message is this treat me well and I will treat you well which means you'll get a good tip. that being said I hope next time you get a better tip. all you gotta do is smile it'll go a long way. It wasn't until they wanted us to leave our table, because it was reserved that all of a sudden they could clean it up.. I realize you have to deal with difficult people... But at any given time you truly have no idea who you're dealing with. we are all not the same as customers as you are not all the same as servers and bartenders. I hope on my next visit things are rectified and that this isn't the norm. And I will be happy to add more stars... And I'm hoping I get to add more stars and not take any away",

When they brought the bottles I was surprise to see that these were smaller than a 16 oz bottle of water, what a ripoff.

The good: The view is amazing and if you get there early enough (730 ish) snagging a coveted cabana spot by the pool is no problem. It lacks any real table space, but it worked. The bad: Read the menu before coming, it's mostly vegan friendly fare. If you like real meat, there 3 items that have it. Luster burger, Turkey and Bacon flat and the turkey burger.  All of is was overpriced for what you got and it took literally forever. One of our friends lives in far Southeast Chandler (over 50 miles). He texted us he was leaving his house right after we ordered our appetizers. He arrived to our table before the food did. (almost an hour). Our drinks that had been ordered at the same time had arrived moments before. At this point in time the place was not that busy, most of the patio tables were vacant, half the pool area was as well and there appeared to be 2 servers, a dark haired girl and a blonde. We had the dark haired girl and clearly we were not a priority. Eventually the blonde took our secondary drink orders and seemed way pissed off having to cover for the other girl (not that we blame her). The drinks were OK, but nothing to write home about. This place has a ton of potential but until I read the service has improved I won't be returning.  Go down the stairs to the Tilted Kilt, no views, but the service and food is much better.",

    "text": "Went to Lustre this afternoon after a performance with great expectations based on the website description. First impression - the bar didn't strike me as \"chic\" at all, very basic. The food selection on the menu didn't impress at all - nothing that appeared exciting or easily sharable. My friend and I ended up sharing a chicken salad wrap, as basic as they come. But the biggest shock was the wine selection. The website claimed an \"excellent\" selection of wine. Well, you judge: one white, one red and one sparkling, take it or leave it. The wine came in a plastic glass, the sort you would get water in. I told the server I drink wine only from wine glasses. He said sorry, the bar is by the pool, that's why. Right next to us, and next to the pool there was a private party, and the guests were served wine in regular wine glasses. I pointed that out to the bartender, but he just shrug his shoulders. So Un-KImpton! Disappointed is all I can say.",

My friend and I stopped here right after zombie walk and we were one of the first people there so we got a nice couch seat next to the (gorgeous) pool. Our waitress was SO friendly and helpful, the atmosphere was fun yet relaxed, the music was fantastic, and it was honestly one of the best nights of my life. It turned out to be kinda a late birthday party for me and it was perfect. I hope I'm able to come back ASAP!",

They had a parking garage right near by, they charged for parking but not too much. Finding the venue was a little difficult, there were two hotels near each other and we kept going to the wrong one. Lustre is in Hotel Palomar on the second floor near Blue Hound. For NYE they had a ballroom and the rooftop open. The pool was uncovered and there was the usual seating around it. There were bars by the pool, outdoor entrance, and outside the ballroom. They had DJ's playing inside and outside so if you didn't like the music somewhere you could always try the other spot. Neither dance floor got too over crowded and we always had breathing space (don't like it when places get so packed you can't move around). We stayed outside for the count down and toasted on the roof. It was a fun event and a nice way to bring in the new year.",

I must say, I am very glad we had a chance to try this place.   First off, the service was very good. Our bartender was very friendly and attentive. We went on a Monday, so there was almost no one there, but it was really nice. We got a couple drinks, and shared chips and salsa. I can't remember what drink I got, but I did like it. The chips and salsa were yummy, ate almost the whole thing by myself. For dinner I got the Spicy Black Bean and Portabello Mushroom Wrap. I enjoyed that as well.  The best part was dipping my feet in the pool after dinner and just enjoying the view! This is a fun restaurant and I am happy I tried it.",

    "text": "The Lustre Bar is situated on the second floor of the Kimpton in Downtown Phoenix. Since the Kimpton is already on the second level to begin with, the Lustre Bar is well above the street level and therefore welcomes great views of Downtown and especially views of the Sun's arena and Chase Field.   Seating is plenty and where most rooftop bars like this would require the purchase of a table in order to sit in one of the trendy seats, Lustre does not. While you sit outside under the stars, the luminous lights provide a lounge atmosphere and the music keeps you entertained.   The location is great to hit up after a sporting event, concert, show or simply if you want to go out in Downtown Phoenix and have a good time.  Plus if you want some delicious food, eat at the Blue Hound downstairs first and then head upstairs after dinner for post-dinner cocktails at Lustre.   My friends and I had a great time here on a Saturday night.   We didn't have any food, but the drinks were fabulous.  The Palomar Paloma was great.  Bartenders are super helpful if you want to take a shot.  We also really loved the Floradora with beefeater gin, lime, raspberry syrup, ginger and soda.  The ambiance was really nice. Love the rooftop and the whole pool thing.  Definitely will have to come back with a swimsuit.",

Mgmt nor staff paid attention to the ruckus the drunkards were causing.  2) A bartender was serving an underage kid (he looked like he was 16/17yo!) beer. Jokingly, I asked this \"kid\" to see his license and he flips me the bird! Yep, definitely UNDER AGE. No wonder noone was checking ID at the entrance!   3) LOW on stock?! I overheard they were out of cranberry juice, Manadrin vodka, some type of beer and almost out of Grey Goose! And this is a bar...on a Saturday night...seriously?!  The pictures on the website are SO DECEIVING, but maybe because the majority of the customers came from a motor cross show (lol!), but this place is NOT POSH AT ALL like the pics on the website lead you to believe. It was not a sophisticated place at all: chairs were all scattered about, sofa cushions topsy turvy, tons of cigarette butts on the stair landing! Whoever was on mgmt that night, was not running a tight ship.   This place needs a major overhaul on staff: get bouncers/security, professional bartenders who are attentive to customers, stock up the bar.   Good luck! The only thing going for this place is location...Oh and the DJ, but that's about it. This place is disappointing! Would never go back again.",

He treated us like royalty and was super friendly and welcoming. Had the chicken nachos - bomb! Crispy chips, lots of cheese and big piles of guac and salsa on top. Also had a few woodchuck ciders - love that they have the cider on tap! And serve it in a plastic tumbler so you can enjoy it poolside :)",

Looking forward to visiting again when they have live music on Fridays and seeing it when it's busy.",

The mojito was the best I've ever had. And if you are looking for a great shot, ask for the Winter.   I don't remember a DJ that night, but maybe he/she was on the pool side?

The only benefit you get is being able to charge your drinks to your room other than that it's just like a separate bar and separate location from the hotel Also if you're staying at the hotel, you don't get to use the pool longer hours. It's like a club that closes. If there's nobody at the pool around nine or 10 o'clock, or anyone at the bar area around the pool, it closes. Also if you have a room that's close to the pool and there happens to be a pool party or dance party that night don't expect to get any sleep. The drinks are expensive and it's definitely a Scottsdale type scene being a pool that's on the third floor of the hotel. Good place to be seen, swim and drink. The food isn't that bad either.  The mitary rate for the Paloma's is great too",

When I arrived, the first thing I noticed was the gorgeous view and the beautiful blue colors. Upon further inspection, I noticed that the all of the lounge chairs were missing cushions and their staff made ordering drinks much more difficult than it should have been. I believe our hostess was Kristen,she didn't greet me or any of my friends, she simply said,\" I'll need a card to start a tab\"  as if a party of African American men and women were are going to skip out on the tab! I found that rude and disrespectful. This place is far from welcoming and does a bang up job of deterring customers from staying a long length of time. The only thing going for this place is the view and the gorgeous Hotel Palomar. I like to form my own opinion and in this case, I should have definitely taken all of the negative reviews into consideration. Thankfully, one of my friends frequents the area and suggested a different place. You guys have the right idea, you really need to focus on customer service, professionalism and ambiance. The view alone can't carry this bar.",

They had no problems going to the guys so every time I needed a drink I had to go to the bar. The bartenders at the bar were nice and efficient in the beginning, because it did not end well. They had a few beers that I was not familiar with so they did allow me to try them before I bought them which was nice of them. At the end when I was done and ready to close my tab I went to show them my check in on yelp so they can honor my 10% discount and I was ignored and they walked away from me. They were very rude and did not even say one word. Not only did they leave me just standing there but they also started helping other customers and completely just ignored me. I was not going to argue the 10%  so I just signed the receipt and still left a tip which I shouldn't have and left. It was a nice pool and almost fun place to hang out this summer, but not if I am going to be getting that type of customer service. I will  be going to other pools and other bars that have better quality when taking care of their customers.",

    "text": "An wonderful friend introduced me to Lustre Bar while I was visiting Phoenix. The rooftop bar is located at the Hotel Palomar in Downtown Phoenix, which is kitty-corner from the \"Talking Stick\" basketball arena.   The view alone is a reason to check this place out. There was a wonderful breeze at night even though it had been over a 100 degrees during the day.  The parking garage is large. Remember to get the bartender or server to VALIDATE your parking ticket. Parking ended up being free since we weren't there for long. Free parking is a huge draw for locals I imagine.   Getting from the parking garage to the actual bar was a maze. We ended up wandering the garage only to learn that you have to switch elevators/elevator lobbies. There could be better signage/maps in the garage.   We had to ask a random guy in the elevator where to go and he kindly led the way. After turning right from the elevators, opening the questionable glass gate/door, and walking up a short flight of stairs, we waltzed right into the impressive rooftop bar. No annoying door guy to deal with, win! There's also another entrance/exit to the bar from the hotel.  Visiting from Florida, I was drawn to the Batida Floridita cocktail, which was actually pretty terrible. The combination of Leblon cachaca, coconut, lime, and creme de menthe was kind of disturbing. I should have known better. The combination of creme de menthe and fruity flavors was not tasty. Other than that, the white sangria I tried was much better. I hope they revamp their menu a bit to include more Arizona inspired cocktails.  The female bartender (one of only two employees running the entire bar) was super nice and down to earth. She stopped by our table, which was far away from the bar/near the pool, several times to give us various menus and drinks. We realized she was having to make a ridiculous amount of trips to us (when the bar was extremely busy) so we ended up walking right up to the bar for faster service from her. I checked in on Yelp to find that there was even a check in discount offer at the time.  A guy stole an cut up piece of apple from the bartender's cutting board, which was not cool. Keep your hands away from their food prep surfaces. The bartender was not happy. Even though she was pissed at the guy, as soon as she turned to serve us she had a smile on her face.  The crowd was lively and seemed to be full of local young professionals after work and a few hotel guests. There were some loud, douchy guys, a few guys wearing bow-ties, nicely dressed women, and a few people playing a bean bag toss game.  As for the view, by the time we received our drinks and got up to check it out - the pool was closed and roped off. I think there might be a better view around the pool area, but I won't know for a long time. During the day, I think you should be able to see South Mountain.  A few weeks later, I get an email from Foder's Travel listing Lustre as one of the top rooftop bars. Woot!  *Tips  *Get your parking ticket validated  *There's a self-service water dispenser at the bar *Check-in using the yelp app in case of discount",

It's inside a hotel but you don't have to be a hotel guest to use the pool and it's free. The pool was beautiful and there were plenty of lounge chairs for laying out. The service was on the slow side but I would say that was more due to the fact that there was only one person working the entire bar area. The food and drinks were good and reasonably priced. As an added bonus, they validate for parking ticket for at least 2 hours. I will definitely be returning.",

Renee was great conversation, lots of knowledge and always good for a few laughs. I basically stuck to their cocktail 'Cool as a Cucumber' since it it was so refreshing and delicious! Renea let me and my girlfriend sample in a green tea shot, which was absolutely amazing. At one point, we also enjoyed the pita and hummus. They were kind enough to give us some fresh sliced vegetables along with the pita bread. The bar is gorgeous and the entire space is open, fun and has the feeling like it would be a pool party. I can definitely see this place being a go-to for locals and visitors alike. You've got to check it out!",

First off the DJ was gawd awful and everyone there was talking about his lousy music choices. Most of us tried tuning it out but it was hard. Then the drink issue. We have Sangria and whoever the bartender was did a terrible terrible job. First it tasted like water and even the return request for another one was still bad but we decided to drink them instead of fighting it.   They weren't busy at all so there was no reason for the two issues. The drinks in particular!",

We had a few different servers during our stay but Christine stood out the most, 5 stars for her! Thanks for the gracious service on Saturday night. The DJ was impressive. Drink tasted a little watered down, perhaps from batching or just the heat. All in all, if you're staying in DTPHX this is a must see.",

Everything was done up so snazzy, white lights all around, dj spinning a good mix of popular music, beautiful people everywhere.  I actually liked that they limited how many got in because although it was plenty crowded, it wasn't to the point where you couldn't move or breathe.  They had free appetizers out most of the night, and it all was delicious!  Just before midnight, they came around with champagne for toasting, and \"snow\" fell from the sky as we rang in the new year.  What a fun time.  If it weren't for the chill, this would have been my favorite New Year's venue in a long time.  Who'd have thought downtown Phoenix could be so cool?!",

The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because we waited a long time for service, and it was a bit pricey, which I would expect from an establishment like this, but the wait was too much considering it wasn't that busy.

But being drunk having a good time and noticing a few things should say something right?  I'm not sure but being my first time here it was damn cold! But I cant really complain because it was an outside patio thats the name of the game. Ok well were the hell were the waitresses? Seriously we were there for at least an hour and had to fight for a place at the bar anytime we wanted a drink...  F that noise. Call me crazy but I dont want to have to get up from my couch area (that I just prewarmed with my ass because it was cold out) and wait at the bar for 20 minutes to get an overpriced drink (that I'll probably finish by the time I get back) to walk back and either find my spot taken or freezing cold again... *sigh* damn it... but this is also my first time...

It was around 7:00 pm & it was the perfect temperature for a drink on the rooftop. We ordered a couple of appetizers which were delicious, though we had to wait almost half an hour for them to arrive.  I definitely would have given the place at least 4 stars except we got the grouchiest server in the world! Just having a bad day was no excuse for her totally uncalled for rude behavior. I hope management reads this review, because unless they get rid of this employee they will lose a lot of customers. She never smiled, rarely spoke & was really abrupt. Everyone at the table immediately noticed her rudeness. At the end she plunked the check down at the table and stalked off without one word. Hey, is it too hard to say \"thanks\"?",

The music isn't too loud so you are able to enjoy conversation while sitting on the roof and admiring the Phoenix skyline! I've only been once so I'm witholding a 5-star to make sure that it is consistently a good time.",

Bar: We could never get up to the bar so one of the waitresses waited on us in the beginning.  She took our credit cards.  We received the first round, really weak drinks for $8! Then we ordered a second round, we never received it.  The waitress came back around and we asked if we could get our drinks, very stressed and rude she said we had to wait and she had to take care of the people in the cabanas first before getting to us. We had ordered our drinks 30 minutes prior in asking where our drinks were. Never received champagne prior to midnight.  They were going to charge our cards for the drinks we never received, then asked if we wanted them. Umm no..it's been more than an hour of ordering, seriously!  2.) Since we couldn't drink prior to midnight, after the stroke of midnight around 12:20ish, we decided to go to the bar downstairs. Last call was at 12:30 and they were not serving anymore.  WHAT!   And the staff (four to five) were again somewhat rude that we were wanting to order drinks and we were sober.  Just wanted to enjoy the celebration. So we went back up and finally got to the bar to order a drink.  The head chef came by and I FINALLY got a glass of champagne. 3.) I didn't try the food but my friends liked the variety of food.  4.) DJ..find another one..music selection was really odd ..drummer was cool 5.) The amount of people was perfect.  It wasn't obnoxiously crowded and people seemed to enjoy themselves. 6.) That morning we heard that the food was spoiled and they weren't going to have the NYE menu which we were all looking forward to. 7.) If you're spending $200 for a room that night, you should be able to get comp tickets. 8.) More staff is needed, and individuals who can handle the crowd.  The waitress we had couldn't handle it for sure especially when she snapped at us for no reason.   Good idea but the execution of the event needs to be flawless for it to take off.  There were so many things I saw that needs to be done.  Three of us are in events management and yelpers, it's bad when we're thinking what could be better than enjoying the party. And again..we were pretty much sober.  May celebrate here again but maybe not.  We will go back prior to NYE2014",

We arrived at 7:30 to have something to eat before everyone else arrived.  It looked like there were 2 guys working the bar and there were 2 or 3 servers.  There were only about 10 customers sitting down at the time.  As we started sitting at the bar the bar tender handed us a menu and said that if we wanted food it would take about 30 minutes and suggested we go find a table.  So we went and sat at a table for 4 and looked over the menu.  29 minutes passed with each of the servers walking past us without asking if we needed anything.  The rest of our party started showing up and still no server took our order.  So I went to the bar to order.  As I attempted to order a couple draft beers the bartender explained that the taps were not working.  That left us with the choice of $5-$6 canned beer or $10 mixed drinks.  He then asked if we had already ordered food.  I explained that no one came to out table which is why I was ordering at the bar.  He apologized and took out order.  After receiving our $6 cans of beer we joined the rest of our party who had sat at one of the large couches. There we sat for another 20 minutes before a server came to take orders.  By that time everyone in our party had already gone to the bar.",

The type of scenery and vibe that this place gives off is EXPENSIVE! So when the bill cane we were pleased to see that they weren't as much as we thought!   The service from our waitresses was awesome! They stayed very attentive and fast with the service for our drinks.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LUSTRE.  What's to love? Well, the views, the atmosphere, the drinks, the food, and the exceptional service, for starters.  I didn't know what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised at the awesome environment.  Things just kept getting better.  The staff brought me drinks by the pool. Then I had to go back to my room, and they held my tab and drinks, no problem.   When I came back, I went to the bar, and my service was seamlessly continued, which I greatly appreciated.  There was even a shift change, and no one gave me any hassles.  I loved it so much, I was there into the night.  I tried their Cobb salad, which wasn't the greatest, but it was good.  In the evening, the view got prettier with the lights on the patio, and the by pool.  Of course, I had some girly cocktails. Epic.  CONCLUSION  I can't wait to come back MANY, MANY TIMES!  5/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Parking is Valet.",

I'm not sure if it's because of new management or bar manager, but the servers hang out by the bar in the shade chatting with one another. Heaven help them if they inadvertently make eye contact with a customer. At this point they begrudgingly leave their shade and make their way poolside ensuring they don't look at any other customers. It's a scene out of Bird Box and one unintended glance will result in their demise or more realistically having to do work.",

I'm a person that always gives the benefit of the doubt but the staff gave a very cold feeling. Though there was no welcome wagon or smiles from the staff, I decided to stay and try a drink. I ordered an adult caprisun, which was good. Definitely a neat drink considering the drink came in a plastic pouch but the overall experience will not have me going back or making the recommendation. The staff member I directly interacted with came off as snooty. I'm glad I tried it out though!",

    "text": "Disclaimer: My rating is mostly based on the food.  The menu had a small but decent selection of appetizers, flatbreads, and sliders.  I ordered the BBQ Chicken Sliders for lunch.  There were three of them per order, and they came with shredded white meat chicken.  They tasted all right, but weren't anything to write home about.  However, I'm pretty sure I just got regular chips and not kettle chips though.  I think the sliders would've been even better with French fries.  Unfortunately, fries were nowhere to be found on the menu, even as a separate item.  I liked that this place was outdoors and not in direct sunlight, so it was still bearable to sit in the open in late May.  It wasn't terribly crowded, so it was reasonably easy to get seated after getting there.",

I was at a private event from 7-11pm and parked in the garage below the hotel. Grabbed my ticket and brought it in. The bartenders were pleased to give me my voucher sticker. As I left the garage, the teller asked me to pay $9!! I thought this was very odd and not happy to pay anything further. They claimed I only get 2 hrs free.... that's something that needs to change. A private event should allow  completely free parking. This is why I gave 3 stars.",

Almost a year went by and I was finally able to go Lustre  a couple weeks ago.  My friends and I had gone around 3-4 pm on a Sunday afternoon. We grabbed some food and hungout for about an hour. I had chicken sliders with chips which was good. I was really excited to see that they carry Effin liquor which is hard to find out here in Phoenix. The views from the building are pretty. Overall, I was a bit disappointed. My friends were not really impressed with their food. I felt like that the atmosphere could've been more up beat. I would like to try coming on am evening and giving this spot a second chance.",

The dip trio, tacos, and flatbreads are our go-tos. Salad is not very good. Overall, we're paying for the atmosphere. On hot summer days, the pool is available to use for paying Lustre guests. We are treated so well and even get validated parking for 2 hours under Cityscape. The pool is mostly in the shade after noon, which can be nice on super hot days. On cool winter nights, it's crowded and fun with good views and a DJ. We love taking out of town guests here.",

There's some great views of Phoenix from their terrace along the edge. I could just stand there for awhile and appreciate the view, but there is plenty of seating too if you need it. They also have live music but come early the bar shuts down at midnight.   It was a bit warm coming in August so I definitely suggest coming in Fall or Spring.   They actually host free yoga classes here during the day, check their schedule online, it's called \"Rooftop Yoga\", classes are by Sutra Studios.",

Our group had plans to hit several other spots in cityscape, but by the time Ken had gone above and beyond for us we were set for the day. You've gotta try the bartender Everett's Arizona Mule.

May consider cover charge to create a more upscale vibe.",

Immediately upon entering, I was greeted by a very handsome waiter and seated near a nice warm heater.  The place was crowded and the music was rocking.  I thought it would take forever to order a drink, since there wasn't alot of staff and the crowds surrounded the bar.  But the waiter that seated me,  I think his name was Marcus, came right over and suggested some delicious cocktails. Within a few minutes, he delivered my drink and offered a menu.  Even thought it seemed like he was extremley busy, he never left me hanging!  He was such a pleasure with a great smile and knowledgeable about the menu items.  I watched him run around all night, serving, laughing and joking with the customers.  He looked like he was making everyone's night better with his personality!  The view is great, the food was yummy (had the ruben panini) and Marcus made my evening enjoyable!!! Nice job Lustre Bar",

    "text": "LOVE Lustre Bar! It's on the 2nd floor of Hotel Palomar at Cityscape. Hotel Palomar is already on top of Cityscape, so the 2nd floor offers a great view of the city! We went for happy hour on Friday and had a blast! They have $6 signature cocktails, 1/2 off most wines and several apps and flatbreads for under $6! I had the pulled duck flatbread with apples and Gruyere, which was dynamite! I also had this drink called Ruppels somethingorother that's my new fave drink, for now. it's prosecco, honey, allspice liquore and I think lemonade...awesomeness! the atmosphere at Lustre is super chill. Open air rooftop bar with a great live DJ a bit later in the evening and a pool to have drinks by. All in all, I couldn't ask for more out of a cool downtown rooftop bar!",

Attentive, very friendly, and even gave us some good places to hit up afterwards. Ask for her when you go there.",

The place is nice and the service was friendly and professional. Good place to observe the downtown activity, specially if there are big events nearby.  Just observing traffic was good enough for entertainment. Our server recommended a pineapple banana drink that turned out to be good. I think it had Kong in the name. We did not have food or appetizers, just the drinks as we did not have much time. Overall a nice place to meet with friends. They have tables and also cabanas",

    "text": "This place has enormous potential. ENORMOUS. The location is awesome and with the pool being the forefront to the Talking Stick Arena backdrop, you would think it would just be THE place to hang. I keep trying to make it that way but I am disappointed every single visit.   I have visited this bar over the years and keep making excuses for it - maybe it is the time (I have come both day and night), maybe they just had a rush of people, maybe it is because I am not a hotel guest, maybe...maybe..maybe...but I can't seem to put my finger on what the issues are. The bartenders have always been irritated and dry, and I feel uncomfortable asking them for service. The waitresses cannot possibly be bothered whatsoever - and I am in Customer Service and it is beyond my comprehension why they seem to feel that they aren't supposed to go around and ask the guests if they need anything. They hang by the bar and snit at everyone.   There isn't any real ambiance really for the area set up in front of where the DJ or bands play, and that could be so easily remedied with a bit of rearranging of the furniture. It is like they purposely don't want anyone to hang out there for too long, and it is the most obnoxious thing I have ever had to witness. Given the location, the pool, the potential, it could be so much more....  If anyone of significance is reading this, please PLEASE help this place be the cool joint it could be!! I would happily send loads of people to here to where it would be worth the time and effort, I promise you. Until then, I will avoid it for the tons of other downtown spots that like my money in their tills.",

Too far for them to walk I Guess. Pool closes at 10 on a Saturday!! Weird.  After coming here like 10 times and every time........ bad to no service. We even had a party of 4.  They need awesome bartenders WITH a personality. Colder beer. Waitresses that bring you drinks and leave the pool open till 2. They would make way more business. Cause when the pool closed we left.",

Trying hummus today sans bread. Wasn't a huge fan of the banana drink, but all the other drinks I've had here have been delicious. Trying white sangTypical prices for rooftop hotel pool bar.  Update:  Went here the next day. The music was so loud I couldn't hear my own through my ear buds on high. They did turn it down a bit, but I guess I wasn't there to hear blasting music and wanted to relax. The waitress was pleasant but never came back around to see if I wanted anything else just said \"Let me know when you want your tab\". I then had to go to the bar to finally get it myself. Nbd but I would have continued to purchase drinks had she asked if I wanted anything else. Completely different from the service the day before  Otherwise it was too hot for many people to be there so it wasn't crowded.",

Not sure if that's because it's grown and things changed since the last time I was here, but I enjoyed myself and time spent here. There was a DJ and as the night progressed more people came, but it was a super chill, fun evening. You had a mix of super dressed up to people roaming around the pool in swimwear. Again, you can make it what you want and have fun either way! The drinks were good, vibe was good, music was good. My friends and I worked our way through different drinks and shared so we could try a little of everything! From the adult Capri Suns (yes it came in a pouch), you're my bees knees (yes it came in a honey bear), the van Zandt, to the blue drink which equates to an AMF. We also did the dip trio and that salsa was fire",

    "text": "Removing a few stars because of the main male bartender on the weekend - sometimes he's nice and sometimes he's rotten. I once asked what the flavors were for the Capri Sun and he told me to read the board. I didn't know what he meant, so I looked down at the menu and couldn't find it. I asked again and he raised his voice and pointed over there. There's a chalkboard by the bar, which from where I was standing at the other side of the bar I couldn't really see. All this back and forth was not delightful and unnecessary. How hard is it to say \"mango and dr. pepper are the flavors\" No tip for you Sir!. I have been there every Saturday for the past month for the Earn Your Booze workout events, which are fantastic, and it's kind of a hit/miss with the service. I also removed a star because my flip flops were stolen once for several hours and the other time I had my debit card stolen and used downstairs at the Blue Hound. That was annoying! And also, stealing someone's shoes in triple-digit Arizona heat is cruel, I had to ask everyone around the pool if they had my flip flops only to find out some girl was using them to cover her cell phone and keep it from overheating. Well, my feet were overheating!   Ok, now for the positives. They have the coolest views and rooftop pool bar set up. Truly, a nice way to spend the afternoon and morning (protect the wallet and feet accessories of course) Lustre is also free to patrons, and the towel service is very nice. Parking for the first two hours is validated which is also very nice. Drinks are reasonably priced and Instagram worthy. I will continue to come here, oh and they are dog-friendly. My first time here was April 2015 and they were very kind to my little dogs!",

    "text": "This place could be so cosmopolitan. There's a pool and modern looking chairs. The music sucks but the bartender is super friendly. The drinks are happily the star! My date got an adult capri sun which I thought was cute. We're all just big kids who can drink alcohol. I got a drink (Desert something...) and I wasn't sure what was in it but if it were daytime I'd definitely sip that and dance by the pool covered in Fenty Beauty Body Lava. I want to bring my friends and take cute pictures, the view is great. Be aware of the weather because it was a bit chilly and not all of the heaters work!   Date Rating: 3 out of 5.  Cannon calls me everyday and sends compliments every morning. He's a former football player turned health professional. I don't date professional athletes as a rule because I think disloyalty and dishonesty is encoded in their DNA but Cannon seemed so sweet and soft spoken. He has a voice that belongs on audiobooks or at least a podcast... it's so rich and sensual. Unconsciously that's probably why I kept him talking. The date was fine enough except I was a little on edge when he'd place his hand on my thigh or shoulder. I couldn't quite read him. Was he really this shy and sweet or was he just running game? Since I did offer to show him all my favorite spots, we bar hopped a bit. When he was intently looking at the menu, I asked if he liked anything he saw. He flashed me the prettiest smile and said \"I'm looking at it right now\" Cute or some more game? The date started to lose its luster (lol see what I did there?) when he asked to sit on the same side of the booth as me. I really hate that. Now I gotta turn my body awkwardly to make eye contact. He's touching me even more. Luckily he had to get home so we called it early. He walks me to my car and he kisses me. I haven't had a kiss this bad since my 7th grade boyfriend, John Rodriguez. I have kissed drunken frat boys with more technique. For the past 15 hours I have been haunted by the feeling of a lizard's tongue darting in my mouth and my lips being held hostage. I know this is a totally teachable thing but I can only imagine what those lessons would be like. I guess the Hungry Bachelorette School for Making Out is in session.",

We called ahead just to ensure it was open to the public, and it's free to the public. I would, however, recommend calling as they were closing early for a private event and we would not have known otherwise. The drinks were delicious-- adult Capri Sun FTW. The bartender was fabulous, the place clean, and the atmosphere just right. Or only complaint, we didn't come here sooner. A must visit for some sun, drinks and pool during a weekday afternoon!!",

    "text": "We went for a drink hoping it was a rooftop bar, unfortunately it's only on the third floor and the high concrete wall to the south really limits the view although it's a parking lot on the other side so I'm not sure it would be great to see anyway. They are building a 19 story multi use building to the east so this place is going to feel crowded in once that's completed. In the summer this is probably a great location because the sun after 12 PM would be behind the building and therefore you'd be in the shade. In the winter it's a little cold but they did have heaters and the bartender was very nice and turned one on for us. We were going for dinner somewhere else so we did not try any of the snacks but they brought out the little table top menus and they look like they have very nice offerings - interesting combinations on flat breads, mini tacos, several different types of fondues, cool sounding sliders etc.  The drinks are not cheap ($12 cocktails, $12 to $16+ glasses of wine) and they only served a few drink options on the happy hour menu.  The seating has options for couples, four at high tops and large groups with several sets of couches around a central table. A couple of those were under tents so that you could be out there with the sun and be shaded. For people living in the building above or staying at the hotel it's a nice place to hang out especially if you are on an expense account!",

    "text": "For the Central Phoenix crowd, the Clarendon Hotel has long been our only option for a True rooftop hangout. My heart is still with the Clarendon (gotta support local, the views are unobstructed and awesome and there's nothing like getting happy hour tacos from Gallo Blanco and a margarita in a plastic cup and taking them upstairs for a sunset feast) BUT there is a new kid in town, and it's bringing a funkier, sleeker vibe to the scene.   For starters, I love the fact that Lustre Bar is by the hotel pool. Granted, I haven't been in it yet, but one of these days, I may down too many well made daquiris and end up diving in. But I digress. The other thing that really makes Lustre cool is the furniture - from the pool lounges to the sofas, it has a very cool mid-century-modern-meets-today vibe. The views aren't too shabby either - you can look out and see the mountains to the south, as well as Chase Field and US Airways Center. My only complaint about the view is the very large advertisements covering the sides of the two large towers. Since they're only really viewable from the bar, I'm wondering how many folks they're actually going to reach. Lest I forgot, I should also mention that the few times I've been, there's been a really great DJ, adding even more to the cool atmosphere.   Last but not least, of course, Lustre Bar serves the fantastic cocktails from Blue Hound downstairs. Stop by during HH, get yourself a $6 Tommy's Margarita, kick back and enjoy the views and beats. Scottsdale may finally have some competition :)",

It's on the 3rd floor, you can reach it from the front door off of Jefferson, taking the elevator or by going up the stairs on the backside of Cityscape by the Tilted Kilt. Pool is behind the bar, though. They had about 5 beers on draft and some mixed drinks were 5 bucks, but most drinks cost more.  It was getting cold when I went, so they had propane heaters up.   Lustre closes at midnight, even on Saturdays but they have an indoor bar that closes at 2am (I think) on the 2nd floor. I would make the drive here from Scottsdale or far out in the East Valley, this lounge is a real gem. I'd try to enjoy it before the summer heat hits.",

    "text": "This bar has everything it needs to be a huge hit: a great rooftop bar with a pool, view of the city, a city vibe, delicious cocktails, trendy furniture, friendly staff and did I mention delicious drinks!?   Let's start with first things first. Lustre Bar is situated on the second floor of the Kimpton in Downtown Phoenix. Since the Kimpton is already on the second level to begin with, the Lustre Bar is well above the street level and therefore welcomes great views of Downtown and especially views of the Sun's arena and Chase Field.   Seating is plenty and where most rooftop bars like this would require the purchase of a table in order to sit in one of the trendy seats, Lustre does not. While you sit outside under the stars, the luminous lights provide a lounge atmosphere and the music keeps you entertained.   This is definitely a great bar to visit after a long workday, after a sporting event, concert, show or simply if you want to go out in Downtown Phoenix and have a good time. Plus if you want some delicious food, eat at the Blue Hound downstairs first and then head upstairs after dinner for post-dinner cocktails at Lustre.   Before I go, I should mention the delicious cocktails. These are mixology masterpieces with fresh fruit, cool flavors and appeals to every type of palate. I go for the fruity ones and really loved the Floradora with beefeater gin, lime, raspberry syrup, ginger and soda.",

Took 30+ min for the food to arrive only with the explanation that 'the ticket didn't make it down to the kitchen'. The kicker, the grilled cheese sandwich was stone cold. The cheese was already hardening.   Server was polite but forgot about the Kale Salad I ordered and had to be asked twice for the bill.  They ended up comping the whole meal.

The weather was perfect and the ambiance was killer, and it wasn't that busy so we had no issues finding a place to sit. Then manager Jason Carlton stopped by our table and struck up conversation with us. We told him how we ended up there and he made sure our game was on and even changed our table so we had a better view of the tv. He recommended a few good options off the menu to eat and we decided on the nachos, they didn't disappoint. Jason stopped by a few more times to check on us and made sure the service was up to par. The service was great and Jason was amazing. He was in tuned with his surroundings, not distracted, polite, friendly, you could visibly see he had a good relationship with his staff as they were relaxed and having fun. If you ever stop in ask for Jason and say hi to him, he is extremely friendly and out going! He made our visit awesome and we will go back. Hopefully he will be there. Thanks Jason!!",

My parents were in town for the holiday and after dinner at The Arrogant Butcher (always a favorite), we headed up to Lustre.    The ambiance is great although it definitely strikes me as more of a summer/warm weather destination.  The drinks were disappointing to say the least.  My husband ordered a Manhattan and received an Old Fashioned.  My friend ordered a cider that never arrived.  The drink menu was very interesting the execution was lacking.   Definitely a bummer.",

Ordered drinks at the bar.   After awhile, an indifferent server did ask if we needed anything.   We ordered some food and it arrived shortly after that.  As she set down the food, the server informed us there was a private event starting in 15 minutes and we had to vacate by then.  Would have been great to have so e signage or forwarning prior to ordering.  we go to scarf our dinner as furniture was being moved all around us.  asked to see a manager, it took \"Zack\"  10 minutes to arrive.  From his behavior, it is easy to see where the I different service style comes from.  He indicated the \"they\" had neglected to put signage out for the event but offered nothing beyond that than an apology.  Food was OK, nothing special.  Views are nice, but I would not go back.  Hard to believe this is a Kempton property.",

The only recommendation I have is, perhaps is better signs on how to get there. Because, once my friends got on the correct floor, they were not sure which way to go.  Please make sure if you are Downtown, to stop by and grab a drink at LUSTRE.",

    "text": "I am really conflicted about Lustre Bar. It is an outdoor bar located on the second floor of the hotel (where the pool is). It is beautiful with plenty of comfortable seating throughout. The views are stunning.   The drinks are expensive at $10 a pop. They are handcrafted cocktails (whatever that means) but I often feel they are too strong for me. On one hand, that is probably good because at $10, you won't need to drink many. But I want to enjoy my drinks, so I don't know. You can also order food while you are up there, from the Blue Hound kitchen, which is cool. Keep in mind, though, that it is a limited menu.   We came for the NYE party and that was a bit of a train wreck:   The good: Cover charge was reasonable at $20. The music was great and there wasn't one particular genre, so there was something for everyone. There was a complimentary buffet of light items.   The bad: There wasn't enough heat lamps so groups of people were often huddled under them and I even saw people with blankets. Really????? Service was horrendous and absent. There were only 3 girls working the grounds and at point I ordered a drink from our waitress and we didn't see her for 45 minutes. Plus, I never got the drink I ordered from her. At one point, she sniped at us that she was really busy and never came back. I spoke with an employee about it and he handled it. If we wanted to go to the bar instead, that was a half hour wait to get a drink. It was awful. I was really surprised at how little staffed this NYE party was.   Again, overall, I am conflicted about how I feel about Lustre Bar. I think it still has some growing pains.",

    "text": "I really like place!  Nice pool, great music, and pretty women.  This place totally resembles Vegas!    I checked it out after the NBA All Star Game and the vibe was on point at 3 pm on a Saturday afternoon.  The girl DJing (Kimberly AKA Kim E Fresh) was excellent and knew how to keep the party going.  I like her style and will definitely be on the look out for her.  She played a variety of old school, vocal, and soulful house mixes.  The bartenders and service could use a little help because it's a little slow and not very attentive. The bartender I went to didn't know how to make a vesper martini nor was he familiar with certain alcohol mixes, but he made what I requested and it came out pretty good.  The pool wasn't overcrowded but there were a good amount of people in the water foot bathing and relaxing.  You will see some g-strings and thongs so dont be alarmed.  The pool is free to use for patrons and guest/residents of the hotel.  They also have a ping pong table and corn hole.  To access Lustre, you can go inside Hotel Palomar and take the elevator to the 3rd floor.  But I think there may be another entrance next to Tilted Kilt.    Definitely check it out.  So far, this is my favorite place to relax and chill in Phoenix.",

We came to have a drink after having dinner at the Blue Hound Kitchen and we really like the vibe, the music and it was a beautiful evening....in SEPT!  This place is spacious with inviting lounge chairs, patio sofas, high tops and the bar.  The DJ was playing some great music it was very inviting.    The bar was limited they only serve can beer....nothing on tab, the liquor was limited not all top shelf but sufficient.  Everything is served in a can or plastic due to the pool area.    All in all the crowd was diverse and the DJ was playing to the crowd which made it fun.",

We were going to a Suns game last Monday & wanted a place with decent food, walking distance from the Arena. We showed up around 6p & we were hoping for something fast (game at 7 but we wanted to get there early). When we arrived at the pool bar/restaurant, we weren't sure it was open- such a beautiful setting but almost no one there at that time. Well, thankfully for us they were open.   Staff was very helpful, craft beers were great. I ordered a Chinese chicken salad & it was huge & really excellent! Just right on the dressing & TONS of chicken actually. I eat slow so I had them serve me it in a to-go container from the start, as the rest of my table were all boys who eat at a much faster pace, haha. Think I easily got 3 meals out of it later on, plus the rest of my table tasted & liked my salad as well. Others got flatbreads that def looked good.   All four of us agreed we will definitely come back on game nights. With ordering off a new menu, beers, chatting, & eating- we were in & out in under 45min. We sat at a high bar table which was perfectly comfortable, but the setting is so nice we all wanna come back when we can stay a while, enjoy the craft cocktails & ambiance more.. Maybe one of those cabanas too! Wish I had taken a picture because it was quite beautiful by the pool (oh- & plenty warm with a heater right next to our table :)",

    "text": "Very cool rooftop bar. Phoenix actually looks like a city from up there. Crazy.  Located off of the 3rd floor or so of the Palomar hotel at Cityscape, Lustre overlooks the eastern part of the \"sports\" district downtown. There is a stairway up from the second level of Cityscape, but its best to just enter the hotel and take the elevator up. Theres plenty of comfy seating as well. We were here at night and it was gorgeous out, I cant imagine coming here during the day/ early in the afternoon though. Its just so exposed.  That said, the drinks are great. I had a Camellia Cooler (they have it on tap). It was very refreshing. The majority of the craft cocktails they offer are Southwestern themed (or more specifically AZ themed). Im gonna have to come back and try the Brass Monkey. Sunbru, OJ, housemade Curacuo, and orange bitters? Yes please.  It was a great addition to our little downtown bar crawl.",

This one is a very stylish dark bar, the area is in downtown but most certainly at an upscale mall. Not too noisy, and folks around were ok as well.  The bar tender was excellent. The drinks are slightly overpriced. The food is excellent. The seating is very comfortable. I loved the beef slider and the chip and salsa. Everything is made I house and you can taste that in every bite. We ended getting there pretty late. It was fun. I would most certainly go back if I am Around downtown Scottsdale.",

Came here to check this place out for a future visit, and I will definitely be staying at the Palomar next time; just so I can come to this pool bar all day, every day.  I only had limited time to enjoy the sunshine since we had our flight back to SF that day, but man, was it worth it. Great chill music, but I definitely tapped my feet to it. I love a good soundtrack to life while sitting poolside.  The bartenders were extremely friendly, and humble, which is rare in SF sometimes. Everett was extremely knowledgable about tequilas, and gave me a sip of a great one that I'd never had before. I think the name was Tapatio Anejo..?? Of course I was having such a good time I forgot to check in on my Yelp app and note it down... but just ask for Everett at the bar and he'll guide you in the right direction!   I would highly highly recommend this spot for any young folks that love some music and good vibes by the pool. The DJ was just getting started, so unfortunately we missed the action later in the afternoon, but what I wouldn't give to have stayed!!",

    "text": "I had high expectations for Lustre - and why not - their environment has exactly what I was looking for to escape the heat and have some fun.  After visiting a couple times here, I won't be returning on my own accord not because of the environment, which remains great, but because of the bar menu and bartenders.   My first visit I ordered a Jack Daniels and soda - although it was a bit more expensive than I anticipated,  I didn't mind paying it because of the environment. I didn't think anything of the price until I looked at their menu and discovered that the cost of my drink (a shot of mid-level liquor and water) cost more than their custom cocktails using top shelf liquors.  I didn't order another liquor drink that night.  The second visit, based on my first experience, I ordered a \"tall boy\" beer.  The beer came in a tall and thin bottle, so yes, it was a \"tall boy\", but it didn't have any more volume than a standard beer - it was a pint.  So when I asked the bartender why the \"tall boy\" beer, which was a pint of Budweiser (low level beer) cost $2 more than their craft beers, which were of similar size, he simply didn't answer.  Not that he didn't have an answer, but he would not acknowledge the misleading nature of the menu, nor substantiate his own knowledge that he knew what the title \"tall boy\" implied, and that he served me something that would not be considered a \"tall boy\" by any other bar in the States.   My dining partners on this visit both ordered rum drinks from their custom menu.  Both complained only sips after receiving their drinks that they tasted funky. After only a taste of both it was evident these were incorrectly made drinks. It resembled a mix of a rum sour using cheap sour and a frat-house special.  After perusing the menu further and comparing our tastes to the ingredients, we noticed unhelpful spelling errors/misprints on the menu.  We left for a bar with no environment and real drinks.  I'd like to come back, but someone's gonna have to order for me!",

I would have preferred them not to put Ranch dressing on it. My husband got the crab cake sliders. He said he enjoyed them. We got there at about 6 and it was staring to get crowded,but we were able to grab a table. They have a few seating options. Cabanas for rent with a secure tab drinks and food. I believe it's  $150 for Monday thru Thursday and $300 for the weekends. I guess it's not bad if you know you have a small group joining you and everyone agrees to split the cost. You can sit at the bar, a high top table or couches that are around the outer part of the rooftop. It's on the 3rd floor of the hotel, but you don't have to be a guest. They have music playing and later in the night a live dj and or band. This area shares the pool location so that takes up some of the space. I saw people lounging on the pool chairs as well. We were dressed casual ( jeans and a top).  I would go back for another casual date night , or with out of town guests. I am sure they would like the view.",

It looked like their cabanas didn't do bottle service but instead a pitcher of a premade mixed drink. $250 for a cabana, 6 bottles of water, and a pitcher of premade drink doesn't really seem worth it.",
